is selected as the best compromise between energy saving and safety factor against damage keywords bi directional fluid structure interaction tip clearance composite ducted propeller 1 introduction with the rapid development of composite materials throughout the world the use of advanced materials has become very common in marine propellers in the past manganese nickel aluminum bronze mab or nickel aluminum bronze nab were commonly used as the primary material for propeller construction in the maritime industry due to many reasons such as its superior corrosion resistance high yield strength reliability and affordability young et al 2012 but these materials are heavy expensive and creates noise and vibration in complex propeller geometries as an alternative composite propellers take advantage of the outstanding material properties of composites such as lightweight high strength to weight ratio high stiffness to weight ratio and greater geometrical design flexibility light composite materials can make the design of the blades thicker and more flexible to improve hydrodynamic performance moreover composites can bring us the potential benefits of reduced corrosion and cavitation damage improved fatigue performance reduced noise improved material damping properties reduced manufacturing cost and lifetime maintenance cost motley et al 2009 motley and young 2011 ducted propellers are typical propulsion units widely used in the marine industry it is composed of a propeller surrounded by an annular duct compared with the conventional propulsion propeller ducted propellers are very useful by providing advanced operability and higher bollard thrust to support marine vessels funeno 2017 it is used to improve the efficiency of the propeller and is especially used on heavily loaded propellers or propellers with limited diameter a lot of experimental and theoretical research has been done on ducted propellers bontempo et al 2015 gaggero et al 2012 oosterveld 1967 1970 thurston and amsler 1966 the issue of tip clearance effect has been the subject of many studies on hydraulic machinery such as ducted propellers pumps and turbines for years energy saving and stable operating have become the primary factors for the study of the tip clearance effect the existence of tip clearance has a significant influence on the efficiency of the machinery liu et al 2018 tip clearance effect mainly includes tip clearance size blade tip rounding yang et al 2007 and blade tip thickening mei and zhou 2015 several studies on the effect of tip clearance size on water pumps show that the efficiency decreases as the tip clearance increases liu et al 2017 saha and soundranayagam 1996 soundranayagam and saha 1996 and the pressure fluctuation is intensified with the expansion of the gap goto 1992 mei and zhou 2015b the energy loss decrease of efficiency and unstable operation intensified pressure fluctuation are mainly caused by the enhanced tip leakage vortex with the increasing tip clearance size as one of the special types of hydraulic machinery ducted propellers usually work in incompressible fluid flow and different working conditions similar conclusions on the ducted propeller were introduced in recent years the influence of the tip clearance of a rigid ducted propeller was investigated by the incompressible navier stokes equations with a multiple reference frame mrf method by yongle et al 2015 results show that the efficiency decreases as the tip clearance increases at lower advance coefficient while it has a revised point at higher advance coefficient a pump jet propulsor with different tip clearance sizes was simulated based on the cfd method lu et al 2018 2016 the efficiency of the propulsor dropped sharply with the increase of the tip clearance size under both the cavitation and non cavitation condition the propulsion performance and pressure fluctuation of a pump jet propulsor were analyzed with different tip clearance size yu et al 2019 when the tip clearance increases the thrust and propulsion efficiency can be reduced significantly which are mainly caused by the change of time averaged pressure distributions on the rotor blade while the influence of tip clearance effect for ducted propellers mentioned above is based on metal blades the influence on the composite ducted propeller is underway the ability to accurately predict the hydrodynamic coefficients of a composite ducted propeller is very important for the calculation method the reynolds average navier stokes rans method has been widely used for calculating the ducted propeller performance for years krasilnikov et al 2007 majdfar et al 2017 sanchez caja et al 2000 in this method the propeller is considered as a rigid body however under the hydrodynamic pressure the composite propeller undergoes deformation progress which will lead to performance change in both hydrodynamic and structural regimes a one way coupling method which applied the hydrodynamic forces as the external loads on the rotor was used for analyzing a single blade sewage water pump by benra 2006 this method involved only the hydrodynamic influence on the structure the hydrodynamic performance change due to the deformation of the structure was ignored a coupled boundary element method bem and finite element method fem approach were applied on the study of fsi of composite propellers by y l young 2008 a fsi method of an impeller pump using openfoam was developed and validated by campbell and paterson 2011 a large deformation laminated composite propeller was simulated by bi directional fsi using commercial solvers kumar and wurm 2015 recently the commercial software with fluid structure interaction solver with a coupled cfd fem model is widely used to analyze the hydrodynamic and structural performance of composite propellers in this paper the modeling and simulation using the bi directional fsi method of the composite ducted propeller using commercial solvers based on the mrf method are performed and validated then several structural finite element models of the composite ducted propeller blade with different layups of carbon fiber reinforced plastic cfrp are built and examined the analysis is done to check the mechanical performance and modal properties of the propeller with different stacking sequences and ply angles so that the most suitable layup for the ducted propeller is found finally the fluid structure coupling simulation of the composite ducted propeller with different tip clearance is presented the influence of tip clearance on hydrodynamic performance and structural properties of the composite ducted propeller is evaluated 2 numerical method in this paper the numerical simulations are carried out on a standard ducted propeller geometry the model ka4 70 propeller with a 19 a duct which was presented by marin maritime research institute of the netherland oosterveld 1970 as shown in fig 1 the ducted propeller consists of composite blades with metal hub and duct the diameter of the ducted propeller is d 240 mm the pitch diameter ratio is p d 1 the tip clearance of the standard ducted propeller is 1 mm which is the standard distance in the experimental results several ducted propeller models are established with different tip clearance to analyze the hydrodynamic and structure performance the models of the ducted propeller are developed with unigraphics nx 9 0 the composite structures of the blades are established with ansys acp fsi analysis of both metallic and composite propellers are carried out using cfd computational fluid dynamic coupled with fem finite element method the numerical analysis presented in this paper is carried out by a cfx solver with moving reference frame mrf technique to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of the ducted propeller and transmit the data between the solid and fluid regions 2 1 fluid analysis method the fluid is assumed to be an incompressible fluid which follows the generally accepted assumption about fluid around a marine propeller therefore the governing equations of the problem are solved by the navier stokes equations 1 and 2 of unsteady turbulent as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u l u i x l p x i x l μ u i x l ρ u i u l where u i u v w is the velocity component in the x i x y z direction p is static pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity of fluid ρ is fluid density and ρ u i u l expresses the reynolds stress icem cfd is used to generate the mesh around the propeller and the entire fluid domain the calculation domain is divided into two parts the stationary domain and the rotating domain as shown in fig 2 the stationary domain should be large enough to ensure that the outer boundary will not influence the analysis of the near propeller fluid flow to improve the calculating efficiency periodic boundary condition using 1 4 of the rotating domain are applied the 1 4 model gives the same result as the model of the whole rotating part the stationary domain is meshed with structured elements while the rotating domain is meshed with unstructured elements previous work shows that this combination of both types of mesh can improve the calculation efficiency morgut and nobile 2012 ansys cfx is used to calculate the hydrodynamic performance of the ducted propeller the general grid interface is used as the interface between the stationary and the rotating domain the turbulence intensity of the velocity inlet boundary is set at 1 on the outlet boundary the static pressure outlet with 0 pa reference pressure is imposed the rotating speed of the inside domain is set to 7 5 rps the propeller blades are modeled as an ansys multifield wall by which one could achieve the data transmission between the blades and fluid the duct and the hub are imposed to no slip conditions along the wall cavitation is not considered in this research the water condition of the fluid is 25 c with a density of 998 kg m3 2 2 solid model and boundary conditions ansys transient structural analysis is used for structural setups the total time is set to 2s and the timestep is set to 0 02s this is the same setting used in the cfx solver to make sure the success of the fsi analysis is achieved a fluid solid interface is applied to the propeller blades a fixed support is defined at the root of the blade in the present work two materials for the propeller blades are used copper alloy and unidirectional cfrp both sets of material properties are shown in table 1 the thickness of one layer of composite material is 0 125 mm 2 3 coupling method fluid solid interaction for the propeller is complex process since the mutual effect between water and the blades is a dynamic one especially for the blades made of cfrps which tend to have more deformation under the hydrodynamic pressure than metal ones for cfrps in the blade fixed system the basic governing equations of fsi can be written as follows 3 m μ c μ k k g μ f where μ μ and μ donate the nodal acceleration velocity and displacement vector of the ducted propeller respectively m c and k are defined as the global consistent mass damping and stiffness matrices k g is the geometric stiffness matrix accounting for the effect of large displacements and is a function of μ the total external load f is the combination of the centrifugal force f c o the coriolis force f c e and the hydrodynamic force f h which are defined as follows 4 f f c o f c e f h 3 verification and validation since the standard tip clearance is 1 mm in the experimental results published by marin maritime research institute of the netherland carlton 2018 the verification and validation are carried out on the model of the ducted propeller with the tip clearance of 1 mm to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of marine propellers the following non dimensional coefficients are considered the advance coefficient j total thrust coefficient k t duct thrust coefficient k t n torque coefficient k q and efficiency η these coefficients can be calculated through equations 5 and 6 as follows 5 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 k t n t n ρ n 2 d 4 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 6 j v a n d η j 2 π k t k q where v a advance speed n rotation speed rps d propeller diameter ρ density of water and q blade torque the total thrust of the ducted propeller is t t p t n where t p and t n represent the blade thrust and duct thrust respectively 3 1 mesh resolution and turbulence model to investigate the mesh dependency of the propeller three different mesh resolutions with the same node distribution and different node numbers are calculated in the fluid domain as shown in fig 3 the comparison shows that the mesh with 3 million nodes has almost the same results with the 5 million node mesh at j 0 6 according to the comparison the grid size of 3 million is chosen in this work to ensure both the efficiency and accuracy of the simulation calculation results from three different turbulence models of the ducted propeller at advanced coefficient j 0 6 are given in fig 4 the sst gamma theta model calculates the maximum value for thrust and the minimum value for torque note that the error of the efficiency between it and the experimental results has the maximum value the value for thrust and torque using the sst model is closest to the experimental data and the value of the efficiency is almost the same between the sst model and the experimental results so in this paper the sst model is chosen as the turbulence model in all simulation since it is more suitable for low reynolds formulation 3 2 fsi method after solving the fluid structure interaction of the ducted propeller with copper alloy material the computational results of thrust torque and efficiency compared with experimental data which were published by marin maritime research institute of the netherland carlton 2018 are shown in fig 5 it shows that the computed results of the ducted propeller s open water characteristics are in good agreement with the experimental results the calculation results for the ducted propeller under non fsi method and fsi method using the same mesh and turbulence model for the fluid domain compared with the experimental results are summarized in table 2 the non fsi method is the classic cfd method for analyzing the open water performance of metallic propellers considering the propeller blade as a rigid body the boundary conditions in the non fsi method on the blade surfaces are set to no flip wall we define the error of the thrust coefficient is δ k t k t k t e x p k t e x p 100 the error of the torque coefficient is δ k q k q k q e x p k q e x p 100 the error of efficiency is δ η η η e x p η e x p 100 the result shows that the results analyzed through the fluid solid interaction method have a better agreement compared to the results that did not use the coupling method 4 selection of proper structure for the composite propeller to get a proper structure of the ducted propeller blades five different fem models of the ducted propeller are analyzed by applying hydrodynamic pressure to the composite blade at the design working condition j 0 6 when the tip clearance size is 1 mm the five different stacking sequences with symmetric laminates 0i θ s are selected for the composite ducted propeller blades as shown in table 3 the subscript i denotes the number of 0 layer s denotes symmetric laminates the generation line x axis shown in table 3 a is set as the reference line of fiber orientation of the composite material the direction of the fiber is defined positive from its root to the blade tip the angle θ measured from the reference line defined positive for clockwise rotation direction and negative for counterclockwise rotation direction represents the orientation of the ply fiber therefore the θ of 0 and 90 represent the direction of the span and the chord of the blade respectively the symmetric laminate 04 30 s i 4 θ 30 shown in table 3 b consists of layers with different fiber directions bonded together the ply configurations above and below the geometric midplane are symmetric each blade structure made up of the same laminate 0i θ s with sequence number 1 to n from the pressure side to the suction side is shown in table 3 c since the propeller blade is a complex geometry with variable thickness and the thickness of each layer of composite material is constant the number of layers in different locations are depending on the thickness of the blade 4 1 deformation fig 6 demonstrates the deformation distribution and direction on the ducted propeller with 04 30 s layup on the tip of the blade under working condition j 0 6 it is clear that the deformation mainly affects on the top part of the blade as it undergoes both bending and twisting the maximum deformation is located on the top of the trailing edge we use a non dimensional coefficient l a c to determine the location on the tip of the blade where a is the length measured from the leading edge c is the length of the entire edge the variation of deformation value at the tip of the blade with different layups is shown in fig 7 the blade undergoes less deformation under the hydrodynamic pressure at around 0 5 l and it goes to the minimum value when using the 04 30 s stacking sequence all five curves reach the maximum value at 1 l and the blade undergoes more deformation with 04 90 s layup in comparing the propeller made using a 02 30 s layup with the one made from a 04 30 s layup more layers of composites with 0 degree ply angle provide more flexure strength at the middle of the blade where the blade mainly undergoes the bending deflection the twisting deflection on the blade has a strong effect near the trailing edge at around 0 8 l 0 9 l where the slope of the curves increases rapidly when layups with the same amount of 0 degree ply layers are applied to the blades 30 degree and 45 degree ply angles show better bending resistance ability 4 2 failure criterion to analyze the structural behavior of the composite ducted propeller blade in this paper the five fem models of the composite propeller are evaluated using the tsai wu failure criterion which is widely used for anisotropic materials that have different strengths in tension and compression tsai and wu 1971 in the criterion the material is considered to be damaged if the failure index rf is equal to or greater than 1 while the composite has enough strength when the value is less than 1 failure index for tsai wu criterion is defined as 7 rf f 11 σ 1 2 f 22 σ 2 2 f 66 τ 12 2 2 f 12 σ 1 σ 2 f 1 σ 1 f 2 σ 2 where σ 1 is the longitudinal stress σ 2 is the transverse stress and τ 12 is the in plane shear stress the parameters f i and f i j i j 1 2 6 are strength tensors of the second and fourth rank respectively the coefficients involved can be defined as follows 8 f 11 1 x t x c f 22 1 y t y c f 66 1 s 2 f 1 1 x t 1 x c f 2 1 y t 1 y c f 12 1 2 f 11 f 22 where x t and x c are the tensile and compressive strengths of the material along fibers y t and y c are the tensile and compressive strengths of the material transverse to the fibers s is the shear strength along fibers in ansys acp the 2 f 12 is defined as default value 1 ansys 2013 fig 8 demonstrates the distribution of the tsai wu failure index on a typical blade the failure index increases when the thickness changes via reducing the number of layers in the element the most critical region is at the tip of the blade at around 0 9 l where it shows that the maximum failure index values are between 0 009 and 0 011 which means the present composite layup is well within the factor of safety since the safety factors are all much greater than 1 around 100 then there is little chance of failure and thus we have a stiffness driven design rather than a strength driven design after analyzing the failure characteristics of all five composite ducted propellers the failure indices along the tip edge of the blades are demonstrated in fig 9 compared with the deformation distribution at the tip of the blade in fig 8 the highest maximum failure index values occur at around 0 8 l 0 9 l at the tip where the blade undergoes the strongest twisting deflection comparing the propeller made of 02 30 s layup with the one made of 04 30 s layup composites with 30 degree plies provide more flexure strength at the location around 0 9 l of the blade where the deflection direction is more perpendicular to the 30 degree fiber direction 4 3 modal analysis as the mode shapes from the analysis of the five ply stacking sequences models are almost the same the first three modes of vibration are presented for the ducted propeller blade with 04 30 s stacking sequence in fig 10 the first mode is a pure bending mode and the second mode is a pure torsion mode the third mode is a secondary bending and torsion mode in the direction of the span table 4 presents the first three natural frequencies of the ducted propeller blade from five different stacking sequences models compared with the blade made of 02 30 s layup the blade with 04 30 s layup has higher natural frequencies which means more 0 degree plies can increase the natural frequency of the blade the natural frequencies of the blade with 04 30 s layup exceed those of the other blades that have the same number of 0 degree plies therefore more 0 degree plies with 30 degree plies in the layup can improve the natural frequencies of the ducted propeller from what has been analyzed above the composite ducted propeller blade is nowhere near failure the design should be chosen by how little tip deflection and how much the modal frequency is desired in the design hence a proper stacking sequence of 04 30 s with minimum deflection and maximum modal frequency is chosen as the desired structure of the composite ducted propeller blade 5 results and discussion after what has been analyzed above the 04 30 s stacking sequence shows better mechanical properties for the ducted propeller blade than other stacking sequences the following discussion is all based on the 04 30 s stacking sequence applied to the composite ducted propeller both metal and composite material properties are listed previously in table 1 the results are all calculated using the bi directional fsi method with the same mesh and turbulence model for the fluid domain introduced and validated above 5 1 hydrodynamic performance the hydrodynamic coefficients composed of total thrust coefficient torque coefficient and efficiency are compared between the metal model and a composite model using the same ducted propeller geometry when tip clearance size is 1 mm as shown in fig 11 in general the differences between the composite propeller and the metal propeller are not significant because of the small diameter the composite propeller gives a slightly higher efficiency value relative to the metal propeller at the lower advance coefficient and it decreases when the advance coefficient is higher than 0 6 the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient of the composite ducted propeller are both lower than those of the mettallic one to evaluate the effect of the tip clearance on the ducted propeller made of both metal and composite material respectively the ducted propeller of ka4 70 19 a model with different tip clearance size is calculated by applying the method discussed above with the advance coefficient j from 0 4 to 0 8 the tip clearance is changed by expanding the diameter of the duct with a fixed diameter of the propeller d 240 mm the clearance size is represented as gap to span ratio gsr presents the distance between the tip of the blades and the inner face of the duct is defined as 9 gsr clearance size d 100 the results of the hydrodynamic performance of both metal and composite ducted propeller with different gsr table 5 and advance coefficient are shown in figs 12 14 the results show that when j 0 6 the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient both increase when the gsr increase meanwhile the increase in thrust is lower than the increase in torque consequently the efficiency decreases when j 0 6 all of the three hydrodynamic coefficients decrease first and then increase for the thrust coefficient and efficiency the results decrease along the gsr from 0 417 to 1 041 and then increase as the gap expands the turning point at the higher advance coefficient is 1 041 gsr which leads to an increase in the efficiency of the ducted propeller for both metal and composite models when the gap keeps expanding the hydrodynamic performance of the composite ducted propeller with extra gsr at the typical advance coefficients of 0 6 j and 0 8 j is given in fig 15 the same characteristics are given the thrust coefficient torque coefficient and efficiency change gradually at the lower advance coefficient otherwise the turning point occurs at 1 041 gsr for the thrust coefficient and efficiency at the higher advance coefficient it indicates that for both of the metal and composite ducted propeller the expanding of the gap can increase the efficiency at the higher advance coefficient after 1 041 gsr but it leads to the efficiency reduction at the lower advance coefficient with the different gsr of the metal and composite ducted propeller figs 12 14 the two curves of each figure of thrust coefficient and torque coefficient are getting closer which means the difference between these two hydrodynamic coefficients between metal and composite ducted propeller are getting smaller it indicates the tip clearance has a strong influence on the hydrodynamic performances of the composite ducted propeller the extending of the gap can improve the thrust and torque coefficient at the same advance coefficient relative to the metal ducted propeller figs 16 17 compare the pressure coefficient distribution on the blade face and the loading on the tip of the composite blade among different gsr with different span and advance coefficient respectively the pressure coefficient is defined as 10 c p p p 0 5 ρ u 2 where p is the pressure on the blade p is the free stream pressure ρ is the density of water u is the velocity of the fluid fig 16 shows the pressure coefficient distribution on the blade face and back the blade undergoes a greater change in pressure distribution in the tip region at j 0 4 than at j 0 7 due to larger deformation the gap size has a strong influence on the distribution of the pressure coefficient as the gap expands the change of pressure coefficient on the back side mainly appears on the area of the blade tip and leading edge while on the face side the pressure change is clearly over a larger range of the blade near the tip and both leading and trailing edge as shown in fig 17 the blade undergoes a greater change in load at the span location of 0 7 r than at the tip region the influence gets stronger as the span increases at all working conditions the load on the face side increases obviously as the gap expands and it increases toward the leading edge at higher advance coefficient j 0 7 there is a reversal point at each curve due to the reversed pressure area near the leading edge as the tip clearance expands the reversed point moves toward the trailing edge and the influence gets stronger toward 0 7 r at the span of 0 99 r it shows more turbulence on pressure distribution and the turbulence reduces as the reduction of the gap size 5 2 structural performance bend and twist effects are a typical deform phenomenon for composite propeller due to the anisotropy property of the material fig 18 shows the maximum displacement of the ducted propeller when gsr 0 417 the maximum displacement of the composite ducted propeller is higher than the metal one due to the increased flexibility of the composite material with the increases in the advance coefficient the effective angle of attack decreases consequently the load decreases which leads to the reduction of the maximum deformation value of both blades the blade tends to bend toward the upstream direction due to the higher pressure on the face side as shown in fig 6 the deformation increases toward the blade tip due to the root fixing on the hub is like a beam on the wall the efficiency of a rigid propeller reaches an optimal value at the design geometry so the change of geometry will lead to the reduction of efficiency yin l young 2008 for composite propellers the flexibility of the material has an influence on the geometry deformation under external load which will change the efficiency value fig 19 shows the maximum displacement of the composite ducted propeller with different advance coefficient versus gsr the maximum displacement value increases with the expanding of gap at the lower advance coefficient there is a turning point on the curve of 0 6 j at 0 833 gsr for which the maximum value increases first then decreases after it when the advance coefficient is higher than 0 6 the two curves decrease slightly when we combine the hydrodynamic performance of the composite ducted propeller is combined with the deformation properties the increase of deformation of the blades has a passive effect on the efficiency the change of the twist angle δ ϕ at different radials of the blade and gsr are shown in fig 20 with the expanding of the tip clearance the change of twist angle δ ϕ has positive value at the lower advance coefficient where the efficiency of the composite propeller is higher than the metal propeller while it has negative value at the higher advance coefficient where the efficiency of the composite propeller is lower than the metal propeller defined positive for twisting of the blade is when the pitch angle increases the change of twist is defined as the twist angle difference between the deformed geometry of the metal propeller blade and the composite propeller blade 11 δ ϕ ϕ composite blade ϕ metal blade as shown in fig 20 the change of twist angle decreases as the advance coefficient j increases consequently the thrust coefficients and maximum deformations decrease as well at the lower advance coefficient the change of twist angle increases with the expansion of the gap size and the differences between 0 7 r and the tip of the blade trends larger while with the expanding of the tip clearance the change of twist angle decreases at the higher advance coefficients and the differences between 0 7 r and the tip of the blade trend smaller at all advance coefficient the slope of four curves increases with the increase with radials it indicates the influence of the fluid load on blade tip is much higher than it is on the location of 0 7 r since it has thinner geometry at the blade tip there is an exception at j 0 5 where the change of twist angle has a positive value at the span of 0 7 r for all working conditions while it has the negative value at the lower advance coefficient and positive value at the higher advance coefficient compared with the efficiency fig 14 the hydrodynamic performance is mainly influenced by the typical region of the blade around span of 0 7 r it is known that for the rigid propeller the efficiency reaches its maximum value at the design condition in this work the rotation speed is a constant so the attack angle α of a rigid propeller decreases as the increase of the advance coefficient the attack angle of a propeller is defined as α ϕ θ where θ is the inflow angle the inflow angle is constant at the same working condition hence the change of twist angle δ ϕ represents the change of attack angle at the same advance coefficient therefore at the lower advance coefficient the change of attack angle has a positive value and increases as the gap expands and the maximum value of displacement increases at the higher advance coefficient the change of attack angle has a negative value and decreases as the gap expands and the maximum value of displacement decreases hence the prediction of deformation and the change of twist angle are a complicated process for the composite ducted propeller under different working conditions and tip clearances the evaluation of the hydrodynamic performance and structural properties should consider all the influence factors 5 3 parameter optimization from what has been analyzed so far the change of tip clearance of the composite ducted propeller leads to a complex change in hydrodynamic and structural performance to evaluate the overall performance of the hydrodynamic performance and structural properties a parameter optimization method was proposed by zhang et al 2019 the change of efficiency composite ducted propeller relative to metallic one demonstrates the energy change the deformation demonstrates the risk of damage hence an optimized objective function for improving efficiency and decreasing deformation is proposed as follows 12 g δ η i j d i j r δ ϕ i j where δ η is the change of efficiency d is the maximum deformation value of the blade r is the semidiameter of the ducted propeller δ ϕ is the change of twist angle i j represents the different working conditions and gsr respectively the calculated result of g with different gsr is shown in fig 21 the value of g decreases with the expansion of the tip clearance the parameter is designed to have larger desired value to achieve energy saving and risk reduction of structural damage therefore the optimum value of the gsr is 0 417 for the composite ducted propeller 6 conclusions a ducted propeller is an important part of a propulsion system which can lead to the improvement of thrust efficiency the tip clearance change of the ducted propeller has a significant influence on the propeller performance hence the gap size between the propeller and the duct can not be ignored a bi directional fsi method is presented for analysis of a composite ducted propeller the method is validated on a metal ducted propeller and is able to predict the hydrodynamic performance and structural properties the selection of optimal layups of the composite ducted propeller blade is presented by comparing the deformation failure and modal properties the influence of the tip clearance on the composite ducted propeller compared with the metallic one is given the conclusions from the analysis presented in this paper are as follows 1 the bi directional fsi method of cfd fem combined with mrf technique is suitable for the prediction of composite ducted propeller in this work 2 five fem models with different stacking sequences are analyzed after comparing the structural properties the 04 30 s stacking sequence shows better mechanical properties for the ducted propeller than the other stacking sequences 3 the efficiency of the composite ducted propeller is slightly higher than the metallic ones at the lower advance coefficient where the change of twist angle has a positive value while it is lower at higher advance coefficient where the change of twist angle has a negative value the deformation of the composite ducted propeller is higher than the metallic one it decreases with the increase of advance coefficient 4 the tip clearance has a strong influence on both of the hydrodynamic performance and structural properties of both the metallic and composite of the ducted propellers as the gap expands at the lower advance coefficient the thrust and torque coefficient of the ducted propeller increase the maximum displacement value and the change of attack angle both increase at the higher advance coefficient the thrust and torque coefficient decrease first and then increase the maximum deformation and the change of attack angle both decreases for the efficiency it decreases as the gap expands when j 0 7 while when j 0 7 it has a turning point at 1 041 gsr from where the efficiency increases the extending of the gap can improve the efficiency at the same advance ratio of the composite propeller relative to the metallic one 5 the tip clearance has a strong influence on the pressure distribution on the area of the blade tip and leading edge as the gap expands the pressure change at the span of 0 7 r is greater than at the tip region and the influence gets stronger as the span increases the reduction of the gsr can help to reduce the turbulence at the tip of the blade around the span of 0 99 r 6 based on the conclusions above the change of tip clearance of the composite ducted propeller leads to a complex change in hydrodynamic and structural performance as the propeller operates under different working conditions to achieve the objective of energy saving and risk reduction of structural damage the gsr of 0 417 is selected as the optimized result this present work is the first step of a long term research work further work needs to be done on analyzing the tip clearance effect of the composite ducted propeller with more composite materials and stacking sequences and designing the composite ducted propeller by morphing the geometry based on the present geometry such as reduce the thickness or by using sandwich structure on the blade to increase the comprehensive performance acknowledgements supports from national natural science

with the rapid development of composite materials throughout the world the use of advanced materials has become very common in marine propellers in the past manganese nickel aluminum bronze mab or nickel aluminum bronze nab were commonly used as the primary material for propeller construction in the maritime industry due to many reasons such as its superior corrosion resistance high yield strength reliability and affordability young et al 2012 but these materials are heavy expensive and creates noise and vibration in complex propeller geometries as an alternative composite propellers take advantage of the outstanding material properties of composites such as lightweight high strength to weight ratio high stiffness to weight ratio and greater geometrical design flexibility light composite materials can make the design of the blades thicker and more flexible to improve hydrodynamic performance moreover composites can bring us the potential benefits of reduced corrosion and cavitation damage improved fatigue performance reduced noise improved material damping properties reduced manufacturing cost and lifetime maintenance cost motley et al 2009 motley and young 2011 ducted propellers are typical propulsion units widely used in the marine industry it is composed of a propeller surrounded by an annular duct compared with the conventional propulsion propeller ducted propellers are very useful by providing advanced operability and higher bollard thrust to support marine vessels funeno 2017 it is used to improve the efficiency of the propeller and is especially used on heavily loaded propellers or propellers with limited diameter a lot of experimental and theoretical research has been done on ducted propellers bontempo et al 2015 gaggero et al 2012 oosterveld 1967 1970 thurston and amsler 1966 the issue of tip clearance effect has been the subject of many studies on hydraulic machinery such as ducted propellers pumps and turbines for years energy saving and stable operating have become the primary factors for the study of the tip clearance effect the existence of tip clearance has a significant influence on the efficiency of the machinery liu et al 2018 tip clearance effect mainly includes tip clearance size blade tip rounding yang et al 2007 and blade tip thickening mei and zhou 2015 several studies on the effect of tip clearance size on water pumps show that the efficiency decreases as the tip clearance increases liu et al 2017 saha and soundranayagam 1996 soundranayagam and saha 1996 and the pressure fluctuation is intensified with the expansion of the gap goto 1992 mei and zhou 2015b the energy loss decrease of efficiency and unstable operation intensified pressure fluctuation are mainly caused by the enhanced tip leakage vortex with the increasing tip clearance size as one of the special types of hydraulic machinery ducted propellers usually work in incompressible fluid flow and different working conditions similar conclusions on the ducted propeller were introduced in recent years the influence of the tip clearance of a rigid ducted propeller was investigated by the incompressible navier stokes equations with a multiple reference frame mrf method by yongle et al 2015 results show that the efficiency decreases as the tip clearance increases at lower advance coefficient while it has a revised point at higher advance coefficient a pump jet propulsor with different tip clearance sizes was simulated based on the cfd method lu et al 2018 2016 the efficiency of the propulsor dropped sharply with the increase of the tip clearance size under both the cavitation and non cavitation condition the propulsion performance and pressure fluctuation of a pump jet propulsor were analyzed with different tip clearance size yu et al 2019 when the tip clearance increases the thrust and propulsion efficiency can be reduced significantly which are mainly caused by the change of time averaged pressure distributions on the rotor blade while the influence of tip clearance effect for ducted propellers mentioned above is based on metal blades the influence on the composite ducted propeller is underway the ability to accurately predict the hydrodynamic coefficients of a composite ducted propeller is very important for the calculation method the reynolds average navier stokes rans method has been widely used for calculating the ducted propeller performance for years krasilnikov et al 2007 majdfar et al 2017 sanchez caja et al 2000 in this method the propeller is considered as a rigid body however under the hydrodynamic pressure the composite propeller undergoes deformation progress which will lead to performance change in both hydrodynamic and structural regimes a one way coupling method which applied the hydrodynamic forces as the external loads on the rotor was used for analyzing a single blade sewage water pump by benra 2006 this method involved only the hydrodynamic influence on the structure the hydrodynamic performance change due to the deformation of the structure was ignored a coupled boundary element method bem and finite element method fem approach were applied on the study of fsi of composite propellers by y l young 2008 a fsi method of an impeller pump using openfoam was developed and validated by campbell and paterson 2011 a large deformation laminated composite propeller was simulated by bi directional fsi using commercial solvers kumar and wurm 2015 recently the commercial software with fluid structure interaction solver with a coupled cfd fem model is widely used to analyze the hydrodynamic and structural performance of composite propellers in this paper the modeling and simulation using the bi directional fsi method of the composite ducted propeller using commercial solvers based on the mrf method are performed and validated then several structural finite element models of the composite ducted propeller blade with different layups of carbon fiber reinforced plastic cfrp are built and examined the analysis is done to check the mechanical performance and modal properties of the propeller with different stacking sequences and ply angles so that the most suitable layup for the ducted propeller is found finally the fluid structure coupling simulation of the composite ducted propeller with different tip clearance is presented the influence of tip clearance on hydrodynamic performance and structural properties of the composite ducted propeller is evaluated 2 numerical method in this paper the numerical simulations are carried out on a standard ducted propeller geometry the model ka4 70 propeller with a 19 a duct which was presented by marin maritime research institute of the netherland oosterveld 1970 as shown in fig 1 the ducted propeller consists of composite blades with metal hub and duct the diameter of the ducted propeller is d 240 mm the pitch diameter ratio is p d 1 the tip clearance of the standard ducted propeller is 1 mm which is the standard distance in the experimental results several ducted propeller models are established with different tip clearance to analyze the hydrodynamic and structure performance the models of the ducted propeller are developed with unigraphics nx 9 0 the composite structures of the blades are established with ansys acp fsi analysis of both metallic and composite propellers are carried out using cfd computational fluid dynamic coupled with fem finite element method the numerical analysis presented in this paper is carried out by a cfx solver with moving reference frame mrf technique to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of the ducted propeller and transmit the data between the solid and fluid regions 2 1 fluid analysis method the fluid is assumed to be an incompressible fluid which follows the generally accepted assumption about fluid around a marine propeller therefore the governing equations of the problem are solved by the navier stokes equations 1 and 2 of unsteady turbulent as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u l u i x l p x i x l μ u i x l ρ u i u l where u i u v w is the velocity component in the x i x y z direction p is static pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity of fluid ρ is fluid density and ρ u i u l expresses the reynolds stress icem cfd is used to generate the mesh around the propeller and the entire fluid domain the calculation domain is divided into two parts the stationary domain and the rotating domain as shown in fig 2 the stationary domain should be large enough to ensure that the outer boundary will not influence the analysis of the near propeller fluid flow to improve the calculating efficiency periodic boundary condition using 1 4 of the rotating domain are applied the 1 4 model gives the same result as the model of the whole rotating part the stationary domain is meshed with structured elements while the rotating domain is meshed with unstructured elements previous work shows that this combination of both types of mesh can improve the calculation efficiency morgut and nobile 2012 ansys cfx is used to calculate the hydrodynamic performance of the ducted propeller the general grid interface is used as the interface between the stationary and the rotating domain the turbulence intensity of the velocity inlet boundary is set at 1 on the outlet boundary the static pressure outlet with 0 pa reference pressure is imposed the rotating speed of the inside domain is set to 7 5 rps the propeller blades are modeled as an ansys multifield wall by which one could achieve the data transmission between the blades and fluid the duct and the hub are imposed to no slip conditions along the wall cavitation is not considered in this research the water condition of the fluid is 25 c with a density of 998 kg m3 2 2 solid model and boundary conditions ansys transient structural analysis is used for structural setups the total time is set to 2s and the timestep is set to 0 02s this is the same setting used in the cfx solver to make sure the success of the fsi analysis is achieved a fluid solid interface is applied to the propeller blades a fixed support is defined at the root of the blade in the present work two materials for the propeller blades are used copper alloy and unidirectional cfrp both sets of material properties are shown in table 1 the thickness of one layer of composite material is 0 125 mm 2 3 coupling method fluid solid interaction for the propeller is complex process since the mutual effect between water and the blades is a dynamic one especially for the blades made of cfrps which tend to have more deformation under the hydrodynamic pressure than metal ones for cfrps in the blade fixed system the basic governing equations of fsi can be written as follows 3 m μ c μ k k g μ f where μ μ and μ donate the nodal acceleration velocity and displacement vector of the ducted propeller respectively m c and k are defined as the global consistent mass damping and stiffness matrices k g is the geometric stiffness matrix accounting for the effect of large displacements and is a function of μ the total external load f is the combination of the centrifugal force f c o the coriolis force f c e and the hydrodynamic force f h which are defined as follows 4 f f c o f c e f h 3 verification and validation since the standard tip clearance is 1 mm in the experimental results published by marin maritime research institute of the netherland carlton 2018 the verification and validation are carried out on the model of the ducted propeller with the tip clearance of 1 mm to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of marine propellers the following non dimensional coefficients are considered the advance coefficient j total thrust coefficient k t duct thrust coefficient k t n torque coefficient k q and efficiency η these coefficients can be calculated through equations 5 and 6 as follows 5 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 k t n t n ρ n 2 d 4 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 6 j v a n d η j 2 π k t k q where v a advance speed n rotation speed rps d propeller diameter ρ density of water and q blade torque the total thrust of the ducted propeller is t t p t n where t p and t n represent the blade thrust and duct thrust respectively 3 1 mesh resolution and turbulence model to investigate the mesh dependency of the propeller three different mesh resolutions with the same node distribution and different node numbers are calculated in the fluid domain as shown in fig 3 the comparison shows that the mesh with 3 million nodes has almost the same results with the 5 million node mesh at j 0 6 according to the comparison the grid size of 3 million is chosen in this work to ensure both the efficiency and accuracy of the simulation calculation results from three different turbulence models of the ducted propeller at advanced coefficient j 0 6 are given in fig 4 the sst gamma theta model calculates the maximum value for thrust and the minimum value for torque note that the error of the efficiency between it and the experimental results has the maximum value the value for thrust and torque using the sst model is closest to the experimental data and the value of the efficiency is almost the same between the sst model and the experimental results so in this paper the sst model is chosen as the turbulence model in all simulation since it is more suitable for low reynolds formulation 3 2 fsi method after solving the fluid structure interaction of the ducted propeller with copper alloy material the computational results of thrust torque and efficiency compared with experimental data which were published by marin maritime research institute of the netherland carlton 2018 are shown in fig 5 it shows that the computed results of the ducted propeller s open water characteristics are in good agreement with the experimental results the calculation results for the ducted propeller under non fsi method and fsi method using the same mesh and turbulence model for the fluid domain compared with the experimental results are summarized in table 2 the non fsi method is the classic cfd method for analyzing the open water performance of metallic propellers considering the propeller blade as a rigid body the boundary conditions in the non fsi method on the blade surfaces are set to no flip wall we define the error of the thrust coefficient is δ k t k t k t e x p k t e x p 100 the error of the torque coefficient is δ k q k q k q e x p k q e x p 100 the error of efficiency is δ η η η e x p η e x p 100 the result shows that the results analyzed through the fluid solid interaction method have a better agreement compared to the results that did not use the coupling method 4 selection of proper structure for the composite propeller to get a proper structure of the ducted propeller blades five different fem models of the ducted propeller are analyzed by applying hydrodynamic pressure to the composite blade at the design working condition j 0 6 when the tip clearance size is 1 mm the five different stacking sequences with symmetric laminates 0i θ s are selected for the composite ducted propeller blades as shown in table 3 the subscript i denotes the number of 0 layer s denotes symmetric laminates the generation line x axis shown in table 3 a is set as the reference line of fiber orientation of the composite material the direction of the fiber is defined positive from its root to the blade tip the angle θ measured from the reference line defined positive for clockwise rotation direction and negative for counterclockwise rotation direction represents the orientation of the ply fiber therefore the θ of 0 and 90 represent the direction of the span and the chord of the blade respectively the symmetric laminate 04 30 s i 4 θ 30 shown in table 3 b consists of layers with different fiber directions bonded together the ply configurations above and below the geometric midplane are symmetric each blade structure made up of the same laminate 0i θ s with sequence number 1 to n from the pressure side to the suction side is shown in table 3 c since the propeller blade is a complex geometry with variable thickness and the thickness of each layer of composite material is constant the number of layers in different locations are depending on the thickness of the blade 4 1 deformation fig 6 demonstrates the deformation distribution and direction on the ducted propeller with 04 30 s layup on the tip of the blade under working condition j 0 6 it is clear that the deformation mainly affects on the top part of the blade as it undergoes both bending and twisting the maximum deformation is located on the top of the trailing edge we use a non dimensional coefficient l a c to determine the location on the tip of the blade where a is the length measured from the leading edge c is the length of the entire edge the variation of deformation value at the tip of the blade with different layups is shown in fig 7 the blade undergoes less deformation under the hydrodynamic pressure at around 0 5 l and it goes to the minimum value when using the 04 30 s stacking sequence all five curves reach the maximum value at 1 l and the blade undergoes more deformation with 04 90 s layup in comparing the propeller made using a 02 30 s layup with the one made from a 04 30 s layup more layers of composites with 0 degree ply angle provide more flexure strength at the middle of the blade where the blade mainly undergoes the bending deflection the twisting deflection on the blade has a strong effect near the trailing edge at around 0 8 l 0 9 l where the slope of the curves increases rapidly when layups with the same amount of 0 degree ply layers are applied to the blades 30 degree and 45 degree ply angles show better bending resistance ability 4 2 failure criterion to analyze the structural behavior of the composite ducted propeller blade in this paper the five fem models of the composite propeller are evaluated using the tsai wu failure criterion which is widely used for anisotropic materials that have different strengths in tension and compression tsai and wu 1971 in the criterion the material is considered to be damaged if the failure index rf is equal to or greater than 1 while the composite has enough strength when the value is less than 1 failure index for tsai wu criterion is defined as 7 rf f 11 σ 1 2 f 22 σ 2 2 f 66 τ 12 2 2 f 12 σ 1 σ 2 f 1 σ 1 f 2 σ 2 where σ 1 is the longitudinal stress σ 2 is the transverse stress and τ 12 is the in plane shear stress the parameters f i and f i j i j 1 2 6 are strength tensors of the second and fourth rank respectively the coefficients involved can be defined as follows 8 f 11 1 x t x c f 22 1 y t y c f 66 1 s 2 f 1 1 x t 1 x c f 2 1 y t 1 y c f 12 1 2 f 11 f 22 where x t and x c are the tensile and compressive strengths of the material along fibers y t and y c are the tensile and compressive strengths of the material transverse to the fibers s is the shear strength along fibers in ansys acp the 2 f 12 is defined as default value 1 ansys 2013 fig 8 demonstrates the distribution of the tsai wu failure index on a typical blade the failure index increases when the thickness changes via reducing the number of layers in the element the most critical region is at the tip of the blade at around 0 9 l where it shows that the maximum failure index values are between 0 009 and 0 011 which means the present composite layup is well within the factor of safety since the safety factors are all much greater than 1 around 100 then there is little chance of failure and thus we have a stiffness driven design rather than a strength driven design after analyzing the failure characteristics of all five composite ducted propellers the failure indices along the tip edge of the blades are demonstrated in fig 9 compared with the deformation distribution at the tip of the blade in fig 8 the highest maximum failure index values occur at around 0 8 l 0 9 l at the tip where the blade undergoes the strongest twisting deflection comparing the propeller made of 02 30 s layup with the one made of 04 30 s layup composites with 30 degree plies provide more flexure strength at the location around 0 9 l of the blade where the deflection direction is more perpendicular to the 30 degree fiber direction 4 3 modal analysis as the mode shapes from the analysis of the five ply stacking sequences models are almost the same the first three modes of vibration are presented for the ducted propeller blade with 04 30 s stacking sequence in fig 10 the first mode is a pure bending mode and the second mode is a pure torsion mode the third mode is a secondary bending and torsion mode in the direction of the span table 4 presents the first three natural frequencies of the ducted propeller blade from five different stacking sequences models compared with the blade made of 02 30 s layup the blade with 04 30 s layup has higher natural frequencies which means more 0 degree plies can increase the natural frequency of the blade the natural frequencies of the blade with 04 30 s layup exceed those of the other blades that have the same number of 0 degree plies therefore more 0 degree plies with 30 degree plies in the layup can improve the natural frequencies of the ducted propeller from what has been analyzed above the composite ducted propeller blade is nowhere near failure the design should be chosen by how little tip deflection and how much the modal frequency is desired in the design hence a proper stacking sequence of 04 30 s with minimum deflection and maximum modal frequency is chosen as the desired structure of the composite ducted propeller blade 5 results and discussion after what has been analyzed above the 04 30 s stacking sequence shows better mechanical properties for the ducted propeller blade than other stacking sequences the following discussion is all based on the 04 30 s stacking sequence applied to the composite ducted propeller both metal and composite material properties are listed previously in table 1 the results are all calculated using the bi directional fsi method with the same mesh and turbulence model for the fluid domain introduced and validated above 5 1 hydrodynamic performance the hydrodynamic coefficients composed of total thrust coefficient torque coefficient and efficiency are compared between the metal model and a composite model using the same ducted propeller geometry when tip clearance size is 1 mm as shown in fig 11 in general the differences between the composite propeller and the metal propeller are not significant because of the small diameter the composite propeller gives a slightly higher efficiency value relative to the metal propeller at the lower advance coefficient and it decreases when the advance coefficient is higher than 0 6 the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient of the composite ducted propeller are both lower than those of the mettallic one to evaluate the effect of the tip clearance on the ducted propeller made of both metal and composite material respectively the ducted propeller of ka4 70 19 a model with different tip clearance size is calculated by applying the method discussed above with the advance coefficient j from 0 4 to 0 8 the tip clearance is changed by expanding the diameter of the duct with a fixed diameter of the propeller d 240 mm the clearance size is represented as gap to span ratio gsr presents the distance between the tip of the blades and the inner face of the duct is defined as 9 gsr clearance size d 100 the results of the hydrodynamic performance of both metal and composite ducted propeller with different gsr table 5 and advance coefficient are shown in figs 12 14 the results show that when j 0 6 the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient both increase when the gsr increase meanwhile the increase in thrust is lower than the increase in torque consequently the efficiency decreases when j 0 6 all of the three hydrodynamic coefficients decrease first and then increase for the thrust coefficient and efficiency the results decrease along the gsr from 0 417 to 1 041 and then increase as the gap expands the turning point at the higher advance coefficient is 1 041 gsr which leads to an increase in the efficiency of the ducted propeller for both metal and composite models when the gap keeps expanding the hydrodynamic performance of the composite ducted propeller with extra gsr at the typical advance coefficients of 0 6 j and 0 8 j is given in fig 15 the same characteristics are given the thrust coefficient torque coefficient and efficiency change gradually at the lower advance coefficient otherwise the turning point occurs at 1 041 gsr for the thrust coefficient and efficiency at the higher advance coefficient it indicates that for both of the metal and composite ducted propeller the expanding of the gap can increase the efficiency at the higher advance coefficient after 1 041 gsr but it leads to the efficiency reduction at the lower advance coefficient with the different gsr of the metal and composite ducted propeller figs 12 14 the two curves of each figure of thrust coefficient and torque coefficient are getting closer which means the difference between these two hydrodynamic coefficients between metal and composite ducted propeller are getting smaller it indicates the tip clearance has a strong influence on the hydrodynamic performances of the composite ducted propeller the extending of the gap can improve the thrust and torque coefficient at the same advance coefficient relative to the metal ducted propeller figs 16 17 compare the pressure coefficient distribution on the blade face and the loading on the tip of the composite blade among different gsr with different span and advance coefficient respectively the pressure coefficient is defined as 10 c p p p 0 5 ρ u 2 where p is the pressure on the blade p is the free stream pressure ρ is the density of water u is the velocity of the fluid fig 16 shows the pressure coefficient distribution on the blade face and back the blade undergoes a greater change in pressure distribution in the tip region at j 0 4 than at j 0 7 due to larger deformation the gap size has a strong influence on the distribution of the pressure coefficient as the gap expands the change of pressure coefficient on the back side mainly appears on the area of the blade tip and leading edge while on the face side the pressure change is clearly over a larger range of the blade near the tip and both leading and trailing edge as shown in fig 17 the blade undergoes a greater change in load at the span location of 0 7 r than at the tip region the influence gets stronger as the span increases at all working conditions the load on the face side increases obviously as the gap expands and it increases toward the leading edge at higher advance coefficient j 0 7 there is a reversal point at each curve due to the reversed pressure area near the leading edge as the tip clearance expands the reversed point moves toward the trailing edge and the influence gets stronger toward 0 7 r at the span of 0 99 r it shows more turbulence on pressure distribution and the turbulence reduces as the reduction of the gap size 5 2 structural performance bend and twist effects are a typical deform phenomenon for composite propeller due to the anisotropy property of the material fig 18 shows the maximum displacement of the ducted propeller when gsr 0 417 the maximum displacement of the composite ducted propeller is higher than the metal one due to the increased flexibility of the composite material with the increases in the advance coefficient the effective angle of attack decreases consequently the load decreases which leads to the reduction of the maximum deformation value of both blades the blade tends to bend toward the upstream direction due to the higher pressure on the face side as shown in fig 6 the deformation increases toward the blade tip due to the root fixing on the hub is like a beam on the wall the efficiency of a rigid propeller reaches an optimal value at the design geometry so the change of geometry will lead to the reduction of efficiency yin l young 2008 for composite propellers the flexibility of the material has an influence on the geometry deformation under external load which will change the efficiency value fig 19 shows the maximum displacement of the composite ducted propeller with different advance coefficient versus gsr the maximum displacement value increases with the expanding of gap at the lower advance coefficient there is a turning point on the curve of 0 6 j at 0 833 gsr for which the maximum value increases first then decreases after it when the advance coefficient is higher than 0 6 the two curves decrease slightly when we combine the hydrodynamic performance of the composite ducted propeller is combined with the deformation properties the increase of deformation of the blades has a passive effect on the efficiency the change of the twist angle δ ϕ at different radials of the blade and gsr are shown in fig 20 with the expanding of the tip clearance the change of twist angle δ ϕ has positive value at the lower advance coefficient where the efficiency of the composite propeller is higher than the metal propeller while it has negative value at the higher advance coefficient where the efficiency of the composite propeller is lower than the metal propeller defined positive for twisting of the blade is when the pitch angle increases the change of twist is defined as the twist angle difference between the deformed geometry of the metal propeller blade and the composite propeller blade 11 δ ϕ ϕ composite blade ϕ metal blade as shown in fig 20 the change of twist angle decreases as the advance coefficient j increases consequently the thrust coefficients and maximum deformations decrease as well at the lower advance coefficient the change of twist angle increases with the expansion of the gap size and the differences between 0 7 r and the tip of the blade trends larger while with the expanding of the tip clearance the change of twist angle decreases at the higher advance coefficients and the differences between 0 7 r and the tip of the blade trend smaller at all advance coefficient the slope of four curves increases with the increase with radials it indicates the influence of the fluid load on blade tip is much higher than it is on the location of 0 7 r since it has thinner geometry at the blade tip there is an exception at j 0 5 where the change of twist angle has a positive value at the span of 0 7 r for all working conditions while it has the negative value at the lower advance coefficient and positive value at the higher advance coefficient compared with the efficiency fig 14 the hydrodynamic performance is mainly influenced by the typical region of the blade around span of 0 7 r it is known that for the rigid propeller the efficiency reaches its maximum value at the design condition in this work the rotation speed is a constant so the attack angle α of a rigid propeller decreases as the increase of the advance coefficient the attack angle of a propeller is defined as α ϕ θ where θ is the inflow angle the inflow angle is constant at the same working condition hence the change of twist angle δ ϕ represents the change of attack angle at the same advance coefficient therefore at the lower advance coefficient the change of attack angle has a positive value and increases as the gap expands and the maximum value of displacement increases at the higher advance coefficient the change of attack angle has a negative value and decreases as the gap expands and the maximum value of displacement decreases hence the prediction of deformation and the change of twist angle are a complicated process for the composite ducted propeller under different working conditions and tip clearances the evaluation of the hydrodynamic performance and structural properties should consider all the influence factors 5 3 parameter optimization from what has been analyzed so far the change of tip clearance of the composite ducted propeller leads to a complex change in hydrodynamic and structural performance to evaluate the overall performance of the hydrodynamic performance and structural properties a parameter optimization method was proposed by zhang et al 2019 the change of efficiency composite ducted propeller relative to metallic one demonstrates the energy change the deformation demonstrates the risk of damage hence an optimized objective function for improving efficiency and decreasing deformation is proposed as follows 12 g δ η i j d i j r δ ϕ i j where δ η is the change of efficiency d is the maximum deformation value of the blade r is the semidiameter of the ducted propeller δ ϕ is the change of twist angle i j represents the different working conditions and gsr respectively the calculated result of g with different gsr is shown in fig 21 the value of g decreases with the expansion of the tip clearance the parameter is designed to have larger desired value to achieve energy saving and risk reduction of structural damage therefore the optimum value of the gsr is 0 417 for the composite ducted propeller 6 conclusions a ducted propeller is an important part of a propulsion system which can lead to the improvement of thrust efficiency the tip clearance change of the ducted propeller has a significant influence on the propeller performance hence the gap size between the propeller and the duct can not be ignored a bi directional fsi method is presented for analysis of a composite ducted propeller the method is validated on a metal ducted propeller and is able to predict the hydrodynamic performance and structural properties the selection of optimal layups of the composite ducted propeller blade is presented by comparing the deformation failure and modal properties the influence of the tip clearance on the composite ducted propeller compared with the metallic one is given the conclusions from the analysis presented in this paper are as follows 1 the bi directional fsi method of cfd fem combined with mrf technique is suitable for the prediction of composite ducted propeller in this work 2 five fem models with different stacking sequences are analyzed after comparing the structural properties the 04 30 s stacking sequence shows better mechanical properties for the ducted propeller than the other stacking sequences 3 the efficiency of the composite ducted propeller is slightly higher than the metallic ones at the lower advance coefficient where the change of twist angle has a positive value while it is lower at higher advance coefficient where the change of twist angle has a negative value the deformation of the composite ducted propeller is higher than the metallic one it decreases with the increase of advance coefficient 4 the tip clearance has a strong influence on both of the hydrodynamic performance and structural properties of both the metallic and composite of the ducted propellers as the gap expands at the lower advance coefficient the thrust and torque coefficient of the ducted propeller increase the maximum displacement value and the change of attack angle both increase at the higher advance coefficient the thrust and torque coefficient decrease first and then increase the maximum deformation and the change of attack angle both decreases for the efficiency it decreases as the gap expands when j 0 7 while when j 0 7 it has a turning point at 1 041 gsr from where the efficiency increases the extending of the gap can improve the efficiency at the same advance ratio of the composite propeller relative to the metallic one 5 the tip clearance has a strong influence on the pressure distribution on the area of the blade tip and leading edge as the gap expands the pressure change at the span of 0 7 r is greater than at the tip region and the influence gets stronger as the span increases the reduction of the gsr can help to reduce the turbulence at the tip of the blade around the span of 0 99 r 6 based on the conclusions above the change of tip clearance of the composite ducted propeller leads to a complex change in hydrodynamic and structural performance as the propeller operates under different working conditions to achieve the objective of energy saving and risk reduction of structural damage the gsr of 0 417 is selected as the optimized result this present work is the first step of a long term research work further work needs to be done on analyzing the tip clearance effect of the composite ducted propeller with more composite materials and stacking sequences and designing the composite ducted propeller by morphing the geometry based on the present geometry such as reduce the thickness or by using sandwich structure on the blade to increase the comprehensive performance acknowledgements supports from national natural science

has proposed a concept of low carbon shipping the main greenhouse gas caused by international shipping is carbon dioxide co2 the reduction of carbon dioxide co2 emissions from international shipping transportation industry is a priority issue for maritime industry the amount of carbon dioxide co2 emissions are shown in fig 1 below emissions of carbon dioxide from the shipping industry has increased considerably in volume in recent years carbon dioxide the main factor in causing present climate change and future global warming potential the different proportions of carbon dioxide emissions between the shipping transportation industry and other industries are shown in fig 2 below there are some previous studies on co2 emissions from international shipping transportation those studies have concentrated on decreasing the amount of gas emissions in order to meet the requirements of the international convention for prevention of sea environment pollution marpol 73 78 the critical issue of sea environment pollution has been addressed by derwent and eyring et al derwent et al 2005 eyring et al 2005 the study of ice environment scenarios has been conducted by schröder et

s resistance consequently this influence will have an impact on the fuel consumption rate of the main diesel engine and the amount of exhaust gases emitted the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine will increase when the ship operates in rough sea conditions such as strong winds and waves or in sea ice conditions the ship s resistance will increase during heavy sea conditions schröder et

clustering method has a long history of use starting with the research of zadeh in 1965 zadeh 1965 zadeh investigated the fuzzy logic theory and concluded that the creation of approximate clustering was a better method than using crisp clustering the research objects of the clustering analysis method has been investigated through the classification of those objects similar objects are classified into separate groups the clustering method of a numerical data series is used popularly in the form of the many classification and analysing systems model algorithm the usefulness of this method is highlighted through this research the numerous data series will be clustered into certain that are representative of a system s model behaviour in addition the machine learning method includes supervised and unsupervised methods the clustering method is classified into unsupervised methods if quantitative and qualitative data is collected then the clustering technique method can be used for data analysis this data is considered as the typical observation process each observation will include n measured variables into n dimensional row vector x k x k 1 x k 2 x k n t where x k r n in order to set the n observations are carried out by x x k k 1 2 n and represented by a matrix n n 1 x x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x n 1 x n 2 x n n the central idea concerns a type of non unique partitioning of the data in a collection cluster the fuzzy clustering algorithm method will be conducted to divide the database into certain groups meanwhile these clusters are generated to their natural shapes klawonn et al 1999 in some cases the value of the membership function is zero this means the data point of a certain group is not a member of a cluster after the data analysing process is finished the fuzzy clustering method includes all the data points each data point will associate with the degree of membership function for each certain group the membership function has the value range from 0 to 1 to indicate the strength of an association for each certain group 2 d k n x j k c j i 2 where d k is the distance of the kth data point n is the number of attributes in a certain cluster x j k is the jth value of kth data point c j i is the jth value of ith center cluster the distance concept of a data point from the center clusters is determined by the fuzzy clustering method initially the center clusters are generated randomly when using the fuzzy clustering method afterwards these clusters will be assigned a data point xi into a cluster where the distance is at a minimum when all the data points have been assigned into a certain group the calculation of new center clusters is conducted by determining the weighted average of all the data points in the clusters this calculation continues to be carried out until it shifts towards the center of the cluster set this process is repeated until there is no change in the center clusters 3 2 1 2 fuzzy clustering algorithm the fuzzy clustering algorithm is known as the fuzzy c means clustering fcm algorithm method this algorithm will allow the raw database to belong to two or more cluster groups this process is based on the calculation of the objective function in order to minimise its value the fuzzy c means clustering method includes two processes the first is a calculation of the cluster centers the second is an assignment of points to these calculated centers by using euclidian distance this process happened continuously until the center groups are stabilised fig 10 uses a loop to compute the cluster centers and it is the iteration converge the membership function value of the fuzzy clustering algorithm method is assigned within the range from 0 to 1 the fuzzification parameter m is used in this algorithm with the range of 1 n where it will determine the degree of fuzziness in the clusters the formula of the membership function value calculation is listed below in equation 3 3 μ j x i 1 d j i 1 m 1 k 1 p 1 d k i 1 m 1 in where μ j x i is the membership of xi into the jth cluster d j i is the distance of xi into the cluster cj m is the fuzzification parameter of fuzzy c means clustering algorithm p is the number of specific clusters of fuzzy c means clustering algorithm d k i is the distance of xi into cluster ck in addition the new center clusters will be computed according to equation 4 with the same membership values 4 c j i μ j x i m x i i μ j x i m in where c j is the center of jth cluster x i is the ith data point of cluster μ j is the membership function m is the fuzzification parameter this algorithm is applied throughout the various steps and is processed in the matlab environment program the fundamental calculation will be identified to assess and evaluate the database through the fuzzy clustering algorithm algorithm fuzzy c mean clustering image 1 3 2 2 multi criteria decision making mcdm method the mcdm is an acronym for the multiple criteria

the priority of factors in the field of ship energy efficiency management the local and global weights of each criteria are shown in table 6 from the results the wind speed and wave height are the priority factors to analyse and optimise the loading of the ship these factors relate directly to the navigation environment conditions of ships so the application of the ship energy efficiency management model is necessary in this research when considering the impacts of the navigation environment conditions fig 14 the navigation environment conditions have an impact on the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine of the ship this research is concentrated on solving complicated data when investigating the navigation environment condition moreover this research is a great contribution in the field of ship energy efficiency management of shipping transportation companies in the world the navigation environment condition is presented through the collected data from a certain target ship in this research this data is recorded in the noon log record book onboard like that shown in fig 8 the navigation parameters were monitored and supervised by the engine and bridge officers onboard the m v nsu keystone the data acquisition system is installed onboard as shown in fig 6 8 furthermore the model of ship energy efficiency management is established through the input and output data the input data of this model consists of the navigation environment the loading of the ship and the actual fuel consumption of the main diesel engine these parameters have been collected from a certain vessel of a shipping transportation company in vietnam all databases will be a fundamental condition for carrying out this research besides that the output of this model has been determined through clustering the optimal operation data in order to decrease the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine on bulk carriers so this research will bring innovation in the field of ship energy efficiency management 4 2 clustering the operational data this research has used the novel method for analysing the operational data of a bulk carrier as the amounts of data collected from each voyage are exceptionally large ship operators are not able to evaluate it for such large data sets it is necessary to conduct this research via the application of machine learning techniques to test this a bulk carrier was selected which enabled substantial amounts of operational data to be collected from the various indicators the operational parameters for the data were recorded by officers onboard the vessel these parameters have been analysed carefully in to evaluate the potential energy efficiency management ability of ships during all voyages the use of the data analysis technique is a useful tool in this research the use of the fuzzy clustering method has been conducted in order to classify the certain group from the operational data where each group will be arranged into a group with same characteristic under the navigation environment condition impacts on the ship the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine of the m v nsu keystone is represented in this research each voyage includes two main stages 1 ballast condition no cargo loaded and 2 loaded and unloaded cargo at each port the name of voyage is assigned by the ship master and it is used to distinguish between the different voyages the time history of each voyage is presented in table 7 the detailed information of each voyage has been supplied into the supplementary data of this article the wave height of the m v nsu keystone is shown in fig 15 following the selected voyages in total there are nine investigated voyages recorded in this research depending on the detail of the voyages the operational parameters will include the wind speed m s the wave height m the fuel oil consumption of main diesel engine mt and the loading of the ship these parameters are presented in this section the value of the wave height is variable from 0 5 m to 1 3 m fig 15 the wind speed has been presented in this research the values of wind speed are different at each separate voyage in fig 16 these parameters are variable from 2 5 m s to 5 m s corresponding to the different voyages of the target ship fig 16 the fuel oil consumption of the bulk carrier is variable from 100 700 mt at each voyage fig 17 the type of main diesel engine onboard is typical of the large size high power and slow speed of the majority of bulk carrier engines the main fuel oil used is a hfo heavy fuel oil the volume of fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine is the highest of all the diesel generators and equipment on the vessel so the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine is the focus of this research the trends of wind speed m s and wave height m are shown in this research through collecting the operational data on each certain voyage these parameters are the main ones effecting ships at sea the wave height and wind speed are adopted with the aim of determining the sea state conditions based on the beaufort scale through the two main parameters of navigation environment conditions wind speed and wave height the beaufort scale number obtained is number 3 which corresponds to calm water conditions for the target ship in this research all operational data was analysed through the proposed method in this research the fuzzy clustering method was used in this research to classify identical data into the same cluster fig 18 the certain groups have been classified through the proposed method the novelty method is meaningful in the field of data analysis and ship energy efficiency management in this research the number of clusters is three corresponding to the level of fuel oil consumption including high medium and low n 3 each certain cluster has the same data characteristics the advantage of fuzzy clustering analysis method is the ability to classify the same data characteristics into a certain group with a fuzzy c means clustering algorithm of the fuzzy clustering method this research has achieved the optimal feature in the field of data analysis and ship energy efficiency management furthermore each group includes parameters such as the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine mt the wave height m the wind speed m s and the loading of the ship at a certain cluster the same data characteristics are divided into the same cluster in cluster 1 the wind speed is 3 7225 m s the wave height is 0 7996 m the loading of the ship is the ballast condition no cargo carried in this cluster the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine is the lowest with 82 1207 mt in cluster 2 the wind speed is 3 9395 m s the wave height is 0 8492 m and the loading condition of the ship is fully cargo carried the fuel oil consumption of this cluster is 508 3324 mt for this cluster this is a normal condition for all the ships usually operating in this condition therefore most ships should select this condition in order to operate the ship with the aim of optimising the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine this will increase the ship energy efficiency management for cluster 3 the wind speed is 4 1590 m s the wave height is 0 9144 m the loading of the ship is at full cargo since the ship sailed in heavy sea conditions in a fully loaded condition then the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine is the highest with 625 5257 mt these clusters are represented through table 8 and fig 19 the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine has been classified into three levels low middle and high the fuel consumption wind speed wave height and loading of ship have been classified into the certain cluster there are three clusters corresponding to the name of cluster 1 cluster 2 and cluster 3 these parameters have been determined through the fuzzy clustering method each cluster has the same characteristics corresponding to the investigated loading of ship ballast condition or have a cargo these values would be selected from the collected data of a certain bulk carrier which are specific for each investigated parameter in this research the detailed values of each parameter have been presented in table 8 from the research result this research is significant for ship operators ship owners and researchers in addition the navigation environment condition directly impacts on the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine a light sea condition with ballast loading will lead to low fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine in contrast heavy sea conditions and a fully loaded cargo will result in high fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine in fig 20 the fitness function values are presented according to the different number of the iteration count in this research the number of the iteration count is 14 the trend line of the objective function value is linear and shows a reduction trend this trend of the objective function value is constant at 0 5 105 at the iteration count 5 this presents a good trend of iteration for applying the fuzzy clustering analysis method in the field of ship energy efficiency management the distribution of each certain cluster is presented in fig 21 at each cluster similar operational data is classified into a cluster in addition the data cluster includes the specific parameters that relate directly to ship energy efficiency management these parameters consist of the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine the sea navigation conditions of the ship and the loading of the ship there are a lot of collected data during the operation process of ship this one makes difficult for ship operators ship owners in the ship energy efficiency management the fuzzy clustering method has been researched to solve this problem from the research result the collected data has been divided into the certain clusters corresponding to the different operation condition in fig 21 the description of clustering process has been showed through the proposed method in a result the ship energy efficiency management should be concentrated on the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine the proposed method has been used in this research to cover the navigation environment conditions along with the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine additionally the full loading condition could be the reduction in the fuel consumption of ship the time of ballast condition should be decreased and then the fuel consumption of ship would be decreased this one will enhance the ship energy efficiency 4 3 comparison with previous work the proposed method has been compared with previous work in the field of ship energy efficiency management when considering the navigation environment condition impacts ship energy efficiency management is especially concerned with the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine on board furthermore the navigation environment condition factors will have an influence on the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine when the ship is at sea recently the big data method has become increasingly popular in major data analysis the big data method has been proposed in the field of ship energy efficiency management by yan et al yan et al 2018 the data acquired for the target ship has been processed via the big data method yan et al 2018 the environment conditions have been distributed at the ship position when considering each segment previous work is represented at each different segment and shown in fig 22 the navigation environment conditions of the ship route have been divided into the different areas at each segment this task has been conducted through the big data method in their research the advantage of big data is that it can deal with the large amount of data collected however their research refers only to the navigation environment conditions in order to optimise the engine speed in then there are a lot of the collected data from the ship operation process the big data method of their research has not classified into the certain cluster fig 22 comparing with the fuzzy clustering method fig 19 it is meaningful to support the ship energy efficiency management the navigation environment condition has been classified into the certain clusters in this research by comparing the proposed method for the fuel consumption of marine diesel engine with the collected operation data the fuel consumption is changeable corresponding to the various navigation environment condition in the having a cargo condition the reduction in fuel consumption is 13 3 29 5 comparing with the maximum level of ship 721 2 mt in the actual operation condition corresponding to the cluster 3 and cluster 2 in reality the full loading condition could be the reduction in the fuel consumption of ship in addition the navigation environment condition includes the various parameters in their research the wind speed wind direction water depth water speed have been investigated in then these parameters relate on the navigation environment condition so the selection of the priority factors is very necessary to help ship operators and managers in the ship energy efficiency management the mcdm method has been used to support the decision making process during the ship operation process this presents the priority of the proposed method as well as supporting the stakeholders and shipping transportation companies this work is significant to decrease the management a lot of different parameters relating on the navigation environment condition 4 4 analysis of research results to support the decision making of the ship master captain the support of decision making plays an important role both to the ship master captain and ship owners of shipping transportation companies these research results are significant in the field of ship operation and ship management the novelty methodology has been studied and expressed for a certain bulk carrier of a shipping transportation company in vietnam when compared with previous research in the same field published in ocean engineering these research results are demonstrated to be superior the results have been analysed along with the process of water ballast transfer this process is related to the decision making of the ship master captain during the voyage time with no cargo mcargo 0 moreover this process relates directly to safety and stability characteristics of ships the decision making process in this case plays a vital role for both the chief officer and ship master captain to supervise the water ballast transfer the optimisation of loading of the ship is addressed with the volume of water ballast which is pumped into the ballast water tanks onboard additionally the chief officer and the ship master captain should consider the navigation environment condition that the ship will encounter in order to make an appropriate decision hence the bunkering process will be addressed and analysed along with the research results outlined in this article this process will be calculated directly by the 1st engineer and the chief engineer in order to get a mass of marine fuel oil into the oil tankers the bunkering process is approved by the ship master captain in order to respond the loading of the ship so the research results of this article are of a significant help to the ship master captain in considering the loading of the ship and the bunking process the loading of the ship will be optimised corresponding to the mass of marine fuel oil bunkered into the oil tankers in the engine room as the research indicates the bunkering process must be calculated appropriately in advance to ensure the correct volume of fuel oil supplied to the engines consequently the loading of the ship has been considered along with the volume of marine fuel oil a fully loaded ship improves both ship energy efficiency management and the stability and safety of the ship 5 conclusions and future trends in this research the author has attempted to optimise the ship energy efficiency

4 1590 m s 3 9395 m s 3 7225 m s and wave height 0 9144 m 0 8492 m 0 7996 m respectively 3 the proposed method can also be applied to all types of ship operating in international sea and inland river areas especially this research is useful for ship owners and ship masters when considering their voyages this research can be used by shipping transportation companies in order to plan voyages the full loading condition of ships should be used effectively and the time of ballast condition should be decreased during the ship operation process 4 the future work will address more external factors

the role of the master and the chief engineer is particularly important to the management of fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine meanwhile recent research has been conducted to decrease the fuel oil consumption of diesel engines along with considering the navigation environment conditions furthermore the environmental sea conditions will influence the ship operation according to the ship s resistance consequently this influence will have an impact on the fuel consumption rate of the main diesel engine and the amount of exhaust gases emitted the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine will increase when the ship operates in rough sea conditions such as strong winds and waves or in sea ice conditions the ship s resistance will increase during heavy sea conditions schröder et al studied the impact of navigation environment conditions on the amount of exhaust gas emitted in various sea ice scenarios schröder et al 2017 the use of the novelty method for analysing the

mersin et al mersin et al 2017 this calculation formula has shown the change of ship displacement according to the voyage time the use of the absolute shrinkage and selector operator lasso had been conducted for predicting the fuel oil consumption wang et al 2018a tran has proposed the fuel oil consumption prediction model of the main diesel engine for bulk carriers when sailing in emission control areas ecas tran 2019b lundh et al have proposed an on line estimation method in order to calculate the specific fuel oil consumption of diesel generators on ships lundh et al 2016 2 5 the

clustering method has a long history of use starting with the research of zadeh in 1965 zadeh 1965 zadeh investigated the fuzzy logic theory and concluded that the creation of approximate clustering was a better method than using crisp clustering the research objects of the clustering analysis method has been investigated through the classification of those objects similar objects are classified into separate groups the clustering method of a numerical data series is used popularly in the form of the many classification and analysing systems model algorithm the usefulness of this method is highlighted through this research the numerous data series will be clustered into certain that are representative of a system s model behaviour in addition the machine learning method includes supervised and unsupervised methods the clustering method is classified into unsupervised methods if quantitative and qualitative data is collected then the clustering technique method can be used for data analysis this data is considered as the typical observation process each observation will include n measured variables into n dimensional row vector x k x k 1 x k 2 x k n t where x k r n in order to set the n observations are carried out by x x k k 1 2 n and represented by a matrix n n 1 x x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x n 1 x n 2 x n n the central idea concerns a type of non unique partitioning of the data in a collection cluster the fuzzy clustering algorithm method will be conducted to divide the database into certain groups meanwhile these clusters are generated to their natural shapes klawonn et al 1999 in some cases the value of the membership function is zero this means the data point of a certain group is not a member of a cluster after the data analysing process is finished the fuzzy clustering method includes all the data points each data point will associate with the degree of membership function for each certain group the membership function has the value range from 0 to 1 to indicate the strength of an association for each certain group 2 d k n x j k c j i 2 where d k is the distance of the kth data point n is the number of attributes in a certain cluster x j k is the jth value of kth data point c j i is the jth value of ith center cluster the distance concept of a data point from the center clusters is determined by the fuzzy clustering method initially the center clusters are generated randomly when using the fuzzy clustering method afterwards these clusters will be assigned a data point xi into a cluster where the distance is at a minimum when all the data points have been assigned into a certain group the calculation of new center clusters is conducted by determining the weighted average of all the data points in the clusters this calculation continues to be carried out until it shifts towards the center of the cluster set this process is repeated until there is no change in the center clusters 3 2 1 2 fuzzy clustering algorithm the fuzzy clustering algorithm is known as the fuzzy c means clustering fcm algorithm method this algorithm will allow the raw database to belong to two or more cluster groups this process is based on the calculation of the objective function in order to minimise its value the fuzzy c means clustering method includes two processes the first is a calculation of the cluster centers the second is an assignment of points to these calculated centers by using euclidian distance this process happened continuously until the center groups are stabilised fig 10 uses a loop to compute the cluster centers and it is the iteration converge the membership function value of the fuzzy clustering algorithm method is assigned within the range from 0 to 1 the fuzzification parameter m is used in this algorithm with the range of 1 n where it will determine the degree of fuzziness in the clusters the formula of the membership function value calculation is listed below in equation 3 3 μ j x i 1 d j i 1 m 1 k 1 p 1 d k i 1 m 1 in where μ j x i is the membership of xi into the jth cluster d j i is the distance of xi into the cluster cj m is the fuzzification parameter of fuzzy c means clustering algorithm p is the number of specific clusters of fuzzy c means clustering algorithm d k i is the distance of xi into cluster ck in addition the new center clusters will be computed according to equation 4 with the same membership values 4 c j i μ j x i m x i i μ j x i m in where c j is the center of jth cluster x i is the ith data point of cluster μ j is the membership function m is the fuzzification parameter this algorithm is applied throughout the various steps and is processed in the matlab environment program the fundamental calculation will be identified to assess and evaluate the database through the fuzzy clustering algorithm algorithm fuzzy c mean clustering image 1 3 2 2 multi criteria decision making mcdm method the mcdm is an acronym for the multiple criteria decision making analysis method this method includes eight steps for the decision making process fig 11 for this method the achievement of the goal and the research objective is chosen appropriate to the decision making process belton 1986 the different types of problem are determined and their advantages and disadvantages are highlighted the second step is based on the requirements of a decision these requirements are defined through the expert s evaluation or other technical restraints for the third step the goals must be classified and considered positively baker et al 2002 the fourth step is defining the alternatives the alternatives are critical methods that will transmit the preliminary condition into the preferred condition bhushan 2004 in addition one of the alternatives should be achieved perfectly this task is better selected by evaluating the different alternatives against a set of criteria mateo 2011 the criteria selected will be the most relevant one based on the decision making method the next step will involve the definition and evaluation of the criteria additionally the choice of the decision making method will be conducted finally the alternatives will be assessed against the criteria in order to choose the most suitable one the structure of multi criteria decision making method is shown in fig 12 below the application of the mcdm method will be helpful in enabling the appropriate decision making process the determination of the weight and the alternative is especially important in the mcdm method and the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fuzzy ahp has been used to determine the priority of the criteria it is the main reason that previous research supports the mcdm method in addition there are various methods which have been used in the mcdm method for example the promethee brans et al 1986 the topsis method ren and sovacool 2015 the vikor method opricovic and tzeng 2004 the grey relational analysis method kuo et al 2008 etc the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fuzzy ahp is an effective method in reflecting the vagueness of human thinking along with the interval values in addition this method represents the relative performance of an operational measure which is used as the initial decision making by a human the objective of this research it provide a useful tool to support the ship masters captains or owners as a result the use of the mcdm could be applied to advance and support the decision making system for ship operators and ship owners let u u 1 u 2 u m be a goal and x x 1 x 2 x n be an object afterwards each object will be analysed corresponding to a goal then m will be derived according to the equation 5 5 m g 1 m g 2 m g i m i 1 2 n where m g i j j 1 2 m is the triangular fuzzy with g i is the corresponding goal the calculation of the fuzzy synthetic extent value to the ith object s i is derived according to the equation 6 6 s i j 1 m m g i j i 1 n j 1 m m g i j 1 where 7 j 1 m m g i j j 1 m m g i l j 1 m m g

efficiency operational measure in order to carry out this research the author has established a basic model of ship energy efficiency management when considering the navigation environment conditions which is shown in fig 13 below the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine is complicated as there are a lot of factors influencing vessels the energy efficiency management is based on the multi criteria decision making method in this article decisions on the ship energy efficiency management will be analysed through the multi criteria decision making method fig 13 using the multi criteria decision making method the ship energy efficiency model will define at the problem through a possible issue and the parameters including wind speed wave height ship speed distance travelled and shaft speed will be examined most of these parameters relate to the decision making regarding the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine in addition the loading of the ship has the highest ranking impact on the fuel oil consumption of the diesel engine onboard it is the main reason that this research has been conducted on the impact of the loading of the ship on the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine the criteria for the assessment of the operational parameters is showed in table 4 with its abbreviations the fuzzy ahp method has been used to support the decision making process of the ship master captain regarding ship energy efficiency management the main purpose of this method will be to determine the main factor impacting on the ship energy efficiency management as well as the loading of the ship the optimisation of the loading of the ship has been analysed under the machine learning tool through the fuzzy clustering method the pair wise comparison of criteria has been conducted through multi criteria decision making mcdm a series of equations from 5 to 13 have been used to determine the weight of criteria through the fuzzy ahp method the triangular fuzzy number used in this research is based on the previous research result ho 2011 in table 5 below the criteria is associated with a local weight and global weight the determination of local weight and global weight of each criteria has been calculated through the fuzzy ahp method before the fuzzy ahp method could be conducted the linguistic terms and their equivalent fuzzy numbers are showed in table 5 additionally the knowledge based expert system has been applied into this research through the questionnaires to support the decision making process of the stakeholders in the field of ship energy efficiency management the questionnaires to twenty experts from various shipping transportation activities have been supported in this article they are ship master captain chief engineer manager who have at least over 10 15 years experience on ships the detailed information of these experts could be found in appendix a the pairwise comparison method has proposed firstly by saaty 1980 and could be applied to determine the comparion matrix the value in pairwise comparion matrix could be obtained according to the scale of the relative important table 5 the determination of each criteria table 4 and comparison matrix appendix b has been achieved from the suggestion of these experts along with the scale of relative important the detailed calculation of local weight and global weight of each criteria has been showed following the steps step 1 according to the comparison matrix the weight of each criteria could be obtained by calculating the principal eigenvector of these matrix following equation 14 14 1 a 12 a 1 n a 21 1 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 1 w 1 w 2 w n λ max w 1 w 2 w n in where w 1 w 2 w n t is the maximal eigenvector of comparison matrix and λ max is the maximal eigenvalue of matrix then the global weight vector could be computed by normalizing the maximal eigenvector according to the equation 15 15 w w 1 i 1 n w i w 2 i 1 n w i w n i 1 n w i t in where w is the total weight vector w i stands for the weight of the ith criteria and n stands for the total number of the indicators for example the global weight of the criteria ws is obtained in this research based on the comparison matrix appendix b and equations 14 and 15 then w w s 43 87 137 093 0 32 the calculation is similar with other criteria finally the normalised weight vector is determined following equation 15 as w 0 32 0 30 0 01 0 27 0 00 t the global weights of the five criteria ws wh ss1 dt ss2 are 0 32 0 30 0 01 0 27 0 00 respectively step 2 the synthetic extent values

the synthetic extend value w 0 92 0 90 0 25 0 54 0 02 t then the local weights of ws wh ss1 dt ss2 are 0 92 0 90 0 25 0 54 0 02 respectively the global weight has been computed in order to determine the priority of factors in the field of ship energy efficiency management the local and global weights of each criteria are shown in table 6 from the results the wind speed and wave height are the priority factors to analyse and optimise the loading of the ship these factors relate directly to the navigation environment conditions of ships so the application of the ship energy efficiency management model is necessary in this research when considering the impacts of the navigation environment conditions fig 14 the navigation environment conditions have an impact on the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine of the ship this research is concentrated on solving complicated data when investigating the navigation environment condition moreover this research is a great contribution in the field of ship energy efficiency management of shipping transportation companies in the world the navigation environment condition is presented through the collected data from a certain target ship in this research this data is recorded in the noon log record book onboard like that shown in fig 8 the navigation parameters were monitored and supervised by the engine and bridge officers onboard the m v nsu keystone the data acquisition system is installed onboard as shown in fig 6 8 furthermore the model of ship energy efficiency management is established through the input and output data the input data of this model consists of the navigation environment the loading of the ship and the actual fuel consumption of the main diesel engine these parameters have been collected from a certain vessel of a shipping transportation company in vietnam all databases will be a fundamental condition for carrying out this research besides that the output of this model has been determined through clustering the optimal operation data in order to decrease the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine on bulk carriers so this research will bring innovation in the field of ship energy efficiency management 4 2 clustering the operational data this research has used the novel method for analysing the operational data of a bulk carrier as the amounts of data collected from each voyage are exceptionally large ship operators are not able to evaluate it for such large data sets it is necessary to conduct this research via the application of machine learning techniques to test this a bulk carrier was selected which enabled substantial amounts of operational data to be collected from the various indicators the operational parameters for the data were recorded by officers onboard the vessel these parameters have been analysed carefully in to evaluate the potential energy efficiency management ability of ships during all voyages the use of the data analysis technique is a useful tool in this research the use of the fuzzy clustering method has been conducted in order to classify the certain group from the operational data where each group will be arranged into a group with same characteristic under the navigation environment condition impacts on the ship the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine of the m v nsu keystone is represented in this research each voyage includes two main stages 1 ballast condition no cargo loaded and 2 loaded and unloaded cargo at each port the name of voyage is assigned by the ship master and it is used to distinguish between the different voyages the time history of each voyage is presented in table 7 the detailed information of each voyage has been supplied into the supplementary data of this article the wave height of the m v nsu keystone is shown in fig 15 following the selected voyages in total there are nine investigated voyages recorded in this research depending on the detail of the voyages the operational parameters will include the wind speed m s the wave height m the fuel oil consumption of main diesel engine mt and the loading of the ship these parameters are presented in this section the value of the wave height is variable from 0 5 m to 1 3 m fig 15 the wind speed has been presented in this research the values of wind speed are different at each separate voyage in fig 16 these parameters are variable from 2 5 m s to 5 m s corresponding to the different voyages of the target ship fig 16 the fuel oil consumption of the bulk carrier is variable from 100 700 mt at each voyage fig 17 the type of main diesel engine onboard is typical of the large size high power and slow speed of the majority of bulk carrier engines the main fuel oil used is a hfo heavy fuel oil the volume of fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine is the highest of all the diesel generators and equipment on the vessel so the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine is the focus of this research the trends of wind speed m s and wave height m are shown in this research through collecting the operational data on each certain voyage these parameters are the main ones effecting ships at sea the wave height and wind speed are adopted with the aim of determining the sea state conditions based on the beaufort scale through the two main parameters of navigation environment conditions wind speed and wave height the beaufort scale number obtained is number 3 which corresponds to calm water conditions for the target ship in this research all operational data was analysed through the proposed method in this research the fuzzy clustering method was used in this research to classify identical data into the same cluster fig 18 the certain groups have been classified through the proposed method the novelty method is meaningful in the field of data analysis and ship energy efficiency management in this research the number of clusters is three corresponding to the level of fuel oil consumption including high medium and low n 3 each certain cluster has the same data characteristics the advantage of fuzzy clustering analysis method is the ability to classify the same data characteristics into a certain group with a fuzzy c means clustering algorithm of the fuzzy clustering method this research has achieved the optimal feature in the field of data analysis and ship energy efficiency management furthermore each group includes parameters such as the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine mt the wave height m the wind speed m s and the loading of the ship at a certain cluster the same data characteristics are divided into the same cluster in cluster 1 the wind speed is 3 7225 m s the wave height is 0 7996 m the loading of the ship is the ballast condition no cargo carried in this cluster the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine is the lowest with 82 1207 mt in cluster 2 the wind speed is 3 9395 m s the wave height is 0 8492 m and the loading condition of the ship is fully cargo carried the fuel oil consumption of this cluster is 508 3324 mt for this cluster this is a normal condition for all the ships usually operating in this condition therefore most ships should select this condition in order to operate the ship with the aim of optimising the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine this will increase the ship energy efficiency management for cluster 3 the wind speed is 4 1590 m s the wave height is 0 9144 m the loading of the ship is at full cargo since the ship sailed in heavy sea conditions in a fully loaded condition then the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine is the highest with 625 5257 mt these clusters are represented through table 8 and fig 19 the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine has been classified into three levels low middle and high the fuel consumption wind speed wave height and loading of ship have been classified into the certain cluster there are three clusters corresponding to the name of cluster 1 cluster 2 and cluster 3 these parameters have been determined through the fuzzy clustering method each cluster has the same characteristics corresponding to the investigated loading of ship ballast condition or have a cargo these values would be selected from the collected data of a certain bulk carrier which are specific for each investigated parameter in this research the detailed values of each parameter have been presented in table 8 from the research result this research is significant for ship operators ship owners and researchers in addition the navigation environment condition directly impacts on the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine a light sea condition with ballast loading will lead to low fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine in contrast heavy sea conditions and a fully loaded cargo will result in high fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine in fig 20 the fitness function values are presented according to the different number of the iteration count in this research the number of the iteration count is 14 the trend line of the objective function value is linear and shows a reduction trend this trend of the objective function value is constant at 0 5 105 at the iteration count 5 this presents a good trend of iteration for applying the fuzzy clustering analysis method in the field of ship energy efficiency management the distribution of each certain cluster is presented in fig 21 at each cluster similar operational data is classified into a cluster in addition the data cluster includes the specific parameters that relate directly to ship energy efficiency management these parameters consist of the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine the sea navigation conditions of the ship and the loading of the ship there are a lot of collected data during the operation process of ship this one makes difficult for ship operators ship owners in the ship energy efficiency management the fuzzy clustering method has been researched to solve this problem from the research result the collected data has been divided into the certain clusters corresponding to the different operation condition in fig 21 the description of clustering process has been showed through the proposed method in a result the ship energy efficiency management should be concentrated on the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine the proposed method has been used in this research to cover the navigation environment conditions along with the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine additionally the full loading condition could be the reduction in the fuel consumption of ship the time of ballast condition should be decreased and then the fuel consumption of ship would be decreased this one will enhance the ship energy efficiency 4 3 comparison with previous work the proposed method has been compared with previous work in the field of ship energy efficiency management when considering the navigation environment condition impacts ship energy efficiency management is especially concerned with the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine on board furthermore the navigation environment condition factors will have an influence on the fuel oil consumption of the main diesel engine when the ship is at sea recently the big data method has become increasingly popular in major data analysis the big data method has been proposed in the field of ship energy efficiency management by yan et al yan et al 2018 the data acquired for the target ship has been processed via the big data method yan et al 2018 the environment conditions have been distributed at the ship position when considering each segment previous work is represented at each different segment and shown in fig 22 the navigation environment conditions of the ship route have been divided into the different areas at each segment this task has been conducted through the big data method in their research the advantage of big data is that it can deal with the large amount of data collected however their research refers only to the navigation environment conditions in order to optimise the engine speed in then there are a lot of the collected data from the ship operation process the big data method of their research has not classified into the certain cluster fig 22 comparing with the fuzzy clustering method fig 19 it is meaningful to support the ship energy efficiency management the navigation environment condition has been classified into the certain clusters in this research by comparing the proposed method for the fuel consumption of marine diesel engine with the collected operation data the fuel consumption is changeable corresponding to the various navigation environment condition in the having a cargo condition the reduction in fuel consumption is 13 3 29 5 comparing with the maximum level of ship 721 2 mt in the actual operation condition corresponding to the cluster 3 and cluster 2 in reality the full loading condition could be the reduction in the fuel consumption of ship in addition the navigation environment condition includes the various parameters in their research the wind speed wind direction water depth water speed have been investigated in then these parameters relate on the navigation environment condition so the selection of the priority factors is very necessary to help ship operators and managers in the ship energy efficiency management the mcdm method has been used to support the decision making process during the ship operation process this presents the priority of the proposed method as well as supporting the stakeholders and shipping transportation companies this work is significant to decrease the management a lot of different parameters relating on the navigation environment condition 4 4 analysis of research results to support the decision making of the ship master captain the support of decision making plays an important role both to the ship master captain and ship owners of shipping transportation companies these research results are significant in the field of ship operation and ship management the novelty methodology has been studied and expressed for a certain bulk carrier of a shipping transportation company in vietnam when compared with previous research in the same field published in ocean engineering these research results are demonstrated to be superior the results have been analysed along with the process of water ballast transfer this process is related to the decision making of the ship master captain during the voyage time with no cargo mcargo 0 moreover this process relates directly to safety and stability characteristics of ships the decision making process in this case plays a vital role for both the chief officer and ship master captain to supervise the water ballast transfer the optimisation of loading of the ship is addressed with the volume of water ballast which is pumped into the ballast water tanks onboard additionally the chief officer and the ship master captain should consider the navigation environment condition that the ship will encounter in order to make an appropriate decision hence the bunkering process will be addressed and analysed along with the research results outlined in this article this process will be calculated directly by the 1st engineer and the chief engineer in order to get a mass of marine fuel oil into the oil tankers the bunkering process is approved by the ship master captain in order to respond the loading of the ship so the research results of this article are of a significant help to the ship master captain in considering the loading of the ship and the bunking process the loading of the ship will be optimised corresponding to the mass of marine fuel oil bunkered into the oil tankers in the engine room as the research indicates the bunkering process must be calculated appropriately in advance to ensure the correct volume of fuel oil supplied to the engines consequently the loading of the ship has been considered along with the volume of marine fuel oil a fully loaded ship improves both ship energy efficiency management and the stability and safety of the ship 5 conclusions and future trends in this research the author has attempted to optimise the ship energy efficiency management through the proposed methods the operational data relating to ship energy efficiency management is investigated with consideration of the impacts of the navigation environment conditions the significant parameters have been investigated in this research the case study of a certain bulk carrier has been selected in order to evaluate the proposed method the research result has summarized through some points as follow 1 the multi criteria decision making mcdm process has been researched to support the decision making of ship operators ship owners then the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fuzzy ahp method of the mcdm is applied to determine the priority factors impacting on the ship energy efficiency management the wind speed and wave height are the priority factors to concentrate on analysing the ship energy efficiency management 2 the determination of the specific value from the collected data is the difficult working in the ship energy efficiency management

21822,the paper presents results of considerations on possibility of bottom sandy sediment transport in the south baltic remote foreshore under waves and currents the analysis is based on theoretical modelling of nearbed motion of water and sand in conditions defined by the long term wave wind climate the wave and wind data were collected near lubiatowo poland the study site represents the area of hydrodynamics and lithodynamics typical of the south baltic coast built of fine sands the wind velocities and directions were measured at the coastal research station crs in lubiatowo while the wave data were collected near crs lubiatowo 1 2 nm from the shoreline at the depth of 15 20 m theoretical studies comprise nearbed wave induced oscillatory velocities wind induced currents and wave current interactions the flow velocities constitute the input for determination of the bed shear stresses the computational results expressed in terms of the dimensionless shear stresses values of shields parameter imply a potential possibility of intensive nearbed sand transport under extreme wave wind conditions the analysis shows that the sea bed lithodynamics under respective rare conditions can yield significant short term bottom level changes in the long term scale keywords wave wind climate wave induced nearbed velocities wind driven current bed shear stresses motion of sandy sediments 1 introduction sediment transport rates and sea bottom level changes depend on intensity of nearbed hydrodynamic impacts in nearshore regions particularly in the surf zone the dominant forces of sediment transport are wave induced orbital velocities together with wave driven currents the further in seaward direction the weaker influence of these factors becomes beyond the surf zone water flow near the sea bed can be related with currents typically occurring in the open sea in the remote foreshore of the south baltic sea namely at depths of a dozen or so metres as proved by ostrowski et al 2018 and stella et al 2019 motion of sandy sediments is driven mostly by wind driven currents accompanied by nearbed wave induced oscillatory flows at those locations however high rate sediment transport can take place only under severe storm conditions which occur rarely a question arises whether such rare hydrodynamic and lithodynamic phenomena can result in noticeable short term evolution of the sea bed in the long term scale a so called depth of closure h c is conventionally assumed to be a seaward boundary of the sea bed changes dean 2002 at location of the depth of closure even extremely high waves are said not to cause intensive sediment transport the respective extreme wave conditions are most often represented by the effective significant deep water wave height h es0 as that is exceeded only 12 h per year or 0 137 of the time simple formulas derived by birkemeier 1985 or earlier by hallermeier 1978 1981 enabling assessment of the depth of closure h c from the effective deep water significant wave height h es0 and period t es0 are discussed e g by dean 2002 obviously the depth of closure h c can be determined directly from bathymetric changes if only sufficient data are available from the deep water wave parameters measured at the ibw pan coastal research station crs in lubiatowo in 2006 2015 cerkowniak et al 2015a determined h es0 3 8 m and t es0 9 75 s these quantities yielded the depth of closure h c to be equal to 7 6 m some investigations shows however that there are many proves of sediment motion at bigger depths see rudowski et al 2008 kubacka et al 2016 and uścinowicz et al 2014 for example large bed forms have been observed at depths of 15 30 m along the shores of the south baltic sea in the micro tidal basins with similar hydrodynamic environment the significant seabed changes beyond the depth of closure were also observed for example unexpected huge bottom changes occurred at hujeong beach south korea during storm conditions with high waves and strong currents occurring simultaneously for 2 3 days seabed eroded around 0 7 m do j d et al 2019 the most interesting aspect of these findings is that this kind of bed forms is typical for tide dominated basins such as the north sea see carbajal and montaño 2001 mccave 1971 terwindt 1971 hulscher and van den brink 2001 the bering sea field et al 1981 the shelf of japan ikehara and kinoshita 1994 the shelf located in the vicinity of nova scotia canada li and king 2007 valentine et al 2002 or the irish sea van landeghem et al 2009 the occurrence of very large subaqueous dunes in the non tidal or micro tidal seas is also observed albeit less frequently for example in the southern ebro continental shelf western mediterranean sea several large scale bed forms were found iacono et al 2010 in the valencia continental shelf spain the bathymetry measurements show evidence of wave and current sediment resuspension during a major storm event with a three year recurrence period simarro et al 2015 the formation of subaqueous bed forms on the outer shelf has been related to unidirectional flows produced by ocean currents accelerated by the presence of morphological constraints ikehara and kinoshita 1994 by seasonal monsoon winds kubicki 2008 by strong geostrophic currents along the shelf break gardner et al 2007 or by sinking of cold and dense water masses lykousis 2001 and in some cases by wave energy as a secondary factor iacono et al 2010 the formation genesis of such features in non tidal sea such as baltic sea cannot be identified it should be also highlighted that the analysis of the cross shore profiles near crs lubiatowo cerkowniak et al 2015a 2015b indicates sea bed changes between two measurements at bigger depths h than the calculated depth of closure h c as mentioned before transport of sandy sediments in the remote foreshore during heavy storms is caused by joint impact of waves and wind according to the findings of stella et al 2019 for the site considered only synergic nonlinear interaction of wave induced nearbed oscillatory flows and wind driven currents under extreme stormy conditions can result in high rate nearbed sediment motion further the sediment transport rates obtained by stella et al 2019 for the stormiest analysed period of measurements appeared sufficiently high to result in sea bed level changes the intensive wave wind hydrodynamic conditions however have an instantaneous character in the scale of a year it is unknown whether these conditions given their relatively short duration can explain distinct evolution of the sea bottom it can be supposed that the extreme wave current conditions occurring repeatedly in longer time scales e g over several years cause significant sea bed changes including the appearance and migration of bed forms clarification of this issue is the aim of the present study the main objective of the paper is to give some estimations of potential sea bed level changes beyond the depth of closure in the non tidal sea using long term measured wind wave parameters to this end theoretical sediment transport model is applied together with the continuity equation for sediment 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and data the present study is based on theoretical investigation supported by data that comprises measurements of the wind and wave parameters from january 02 1997 to october 2 2018 the measurements were carried out by the institute of hydro engineering of the polish academy of sciences ibw pan using scientific instruments located at the ibw pan coastal research station crs in lubiatowo and its vicinity the study area of crs lubiatowo is situated on the middle east polish coast see fig 1 the hydrodynamics lithodynamics and morphodynamics in the study area are typical of the south baltic sandy coast see ostrowski et al 2016 uścinowicz szarafin 2019 the sea shore near lubiatowo is mildly sloped with an inclination of 1 2 and consists of fine quartz sand cross shore bathymetric profiles display 3 4 stable bars and an ephemeral one occurring close to the shoreline such a multi bar profile of the sea bottom is favourable to gradual wave energy dissipation through multiple wave breaking see pruszak et al 2008 the exemplary cross shore bottom profiles at crs lubiatowo together with the depth of closure determined by cerkowniak et al 2015a and location of the measuring equipment are shown in fig 2 series of measured wind parameters reveal short discontinuities amounting to few percent of the considered 22 year period of measurements january 02 1997 october 02 2018 discontinuities in wave records are longer and in total amount to 42 of the considered time frame the available series of wave parameters are given in table 1 and presented graphically in fig 3 the deep water wave measurements were carried out at 15 20 m water depth using the directional waverider buoys dwr 9 mk ii and dwr 7 mk iii moored at a distance of about 1 2 nm from the shoreline most often at about 54 50 n and 17 50 e at 18 m water depth the measurements of water surface elevations by the devices are accurate to 0 01 m and they are carried out with a frequency of 2 56 hz the statistical and stochastic wave parameters are determined once per hour on the basis of time series not shorter than 20 min these results together with raw data are stored in the buoy logger as well as transmitted by radio to a receiver and a computer located in the crs lubiatowo building some basic data are periodically transmitted as smss to a receiving computer at the ibw pan headquarters in gdańsk the wind data namely direction and speed averaged over 10 min and maximum gust in 10 min were collected by a cup anemometer sw 48 produced by mors poland installed on a 22 m mast the mast is located on land close to crs lubiatowo 54 48 70 n 17 50 43 e at a distance of about 150 m from the shoreline the anemometer is installed a few metres above the upper branches of nearby trees the location of the anemometer does not satisfy standards of meteorological monitoring and the measurements of wind parameters particularly velocity are biased although the mast is 12 m higher than stipulated by the standards 10 m the increased terrain roughness due to the presence of trees results in the recorded wind speed being smaller than it would be over a flat ground without trees or other obstacles as required at state meteorological stations in poland secondly wind parameters at sea differ from wind parameters on land this problem was already faced and solved by ostrowski et al 2018 who formulated the following equation representing the relationship between the land wind velocity w land at crs lubiatowo and the sea wind velocity w sea at the 10 m height above the sea level 1 w s e a 1 76 w l a n d 1 92 grain size distribution analysis based on the samples taken from the sea bottom at the deep water locations in the vicinity of the wave buoy show that the sediment is well sorted and the grain diameter d 50 is equal to about 0 13 mm the sea bed sand density of the samples is typical for quartz sand and amounts to ρ s 2650 kg m3 according to observations carried out by divers the sea bottom is mostly flat sandy bed forms occur at some locations only these small bed forms ripple marks have heights and lengths of about 5 15 cm and 1 2 m respectively deep water wave parameters measured by the wave buoys namely the wave height period and direction of propagation as well as the wind direction were used directly while the wind velocity vales w land were recalculated to w sea using eq 1 all of these data together with the sea bed sand features constituted the input to the theoretical model of bed shear stresses and sediment transport under coupled impact of waves and wind induced currents 2 2 theoretical model modelling of hydrodynamic and lithodynamic processes was carried out using the theoretical approach of stella et al 2019 within the applied modelling system the non linear interaction of wind driven currents and nearbed wave induced oscillatory flows is taken into account solution of the momentum equation in the wave current bed boundary layer yields hydrodynamic parameters including bed shear stresses constituting the input to the sediment transport model the most important elements of the applied theoretical approach are briefly described below while the detailed description can be found in stella et al 2019 the wind driven current velocity in the surface layer is calculated on the basis of the wind speed w sea as follows u surface 0 03w sea for w sea 8 m s 2 u surface 0 035w sea for w sea 8 m s knowing the superficial velocity u surface under the assumption of the logarithmic vertical distribution of the wind driven current velocity the friction velocity and the shear stress related to the water flow can be determined to this end the bottom roughness k n a so called nikuradse roughness should be known for the flat sea bed the value of k n is assumed equal to the skin roughness k n 2 5d 50 while for the bottom covered with bed forms ripples the roughness k n is assumed to be represented by the ripple height k n k f in the present study the ripple height was assumed equal to the mean magnitude of sea bed forms observed at the study site k f 0 1 m this value was used as k n in the model runs an additional hydrodynamic effect that appears as a roughness for the steady flow due to occurrence of wave bed boundary layer see e g nielsen 2009 was also included in the modelling this roughness called the apparent bottom roughness k a causes that the flow above the wave boundary layer appears to feel larger roughness than the natural roughness of the rippled bed after confrontation of the theoretical flow velocity profiles with the measured ones stella et al 2019 distinguished wave and current dominated flows depending on the value of the apparent roughness k a the wind driven current is dominant when k a is below 0 13 m in this case the mean flow velocity profile in the water column is determined by the logarithmic distribution the wave flow predominates under conditions in which k a is bigger than 0 13 m in such a case the two layer mean velocity profile is valid namely the logarithmic distribution in the nearbed layer and the linear distribution higher in the water column the equation of motion in the wave current bed boundary layer is solved using the integral momentum model of fredsøe 1984 the model yields among others coupled wave current friction velocities u f t variable during the wave period consequently the dimensionless bed shear stresses θ t are calculated by the following formula see e g nielsen 2009 3 θ t u f t 2 ρ s ρ 1 g d 50 in which ρ is the density of water and g denotes acceleration due to gravity the bed shear stresses ρu f 2 generated by waves and currents are the driving forces for motion of sediments building the sea bottom sediment transport rates q t per unit width m3 s m are determined by the three layer model of kaczmarek and ostrowski 2002 integration of these instantaneous rates over the wave period t yields the net resultant sediment transport rate q net 4 q n e t 1 t 0 t q t d t spatial variability of sediment transport rate q net is a direct reason for accumulative and erosive processes occurring at the sea bed conventionally the evolution of the sea bed profile expressed as changes of the water depth h is determined from the following continuity equation for sediment in the direction x of the net rate q net vector 5 h x t t 1 1 n q n e t x t x where n denotes the soil porosity while deposited x is the coordinate related to the axis lying on the q net direction and t stands for the time the net sediment transport rate vector results from wave current interaction in the bed boundary layer under instantaneous hydrodynamic conditions and its direction can be arbitrary with respect to the shore solving eq 5 is not a problem e g by a finite difference scheme for sediment transport rates q net i 1 and q net i 1 determined at points i 1 and i 1 respectively it can be calculated that the water depth change δh i at a point i located in the middle between the points i 1 and i 1 in time δt amounts to 6 δ h i 1 1 n δ q n e t 2 δ x δ t 1 1 n δ t 2 δ x q n e t i 1 q n e t i 1 where 2δx is a distance between the points i 1 and i 1 within the above finite difference scheme variability of q net in each time step δt is neglected as the hydrodynamic conditions does not change rapidly and the time step δt amounts to 0 5 3 h the value of q net can be assumed constant during this time the above modelling system was applied to determine bed shear stresses sediment transport rates and potential possible short term changes of sea bottom level in the remote foreshore during the extreme wave current conditions occurring in the long time scale namely in the period from january 02 1997 to october 02 2018 3 results and discussion the maximum during wave period in combined wave current motion dimensionless bed shear stresses θ max calculated by formula 3 are given in table 2 it appears that during the analysed period intensive sediment motion sheet flow for θ max 0 9 lasts for 8 of the time the same duration namely 8 concerns the moderately intensive sediment motion when θ max is higher than 0 6 but lower than 0 9 these two regimes correspond to the flat bed and the ripple height decrease respectively the regime that cause the ripples appearance on the sea bed for 0 05 θ max 0 3 lasts for 45 of the time while the development of the ripples 0 3 θ max 0 6 takes place over 19 of the analysed period in order to determine the potential changes of sea bottom level at i th point δh i in the study area eq 6 was applied sediment transport rates were calculated in two points first at h 18 m i 1 point and second at h 17 m depth i 1 point within the research area a bottom profile segment was identified along which the 1 m depth change from 18 m to 17 m took place over a distance of around 150 m therefore 2δx 150 m was assumed although the respective bottom profile segment lies approximately parallel to the shoreline the points i 1 and i 1 are assumed to be located in the direction of the resultant sediment transport q net induced by wave current motion during each hydrodynamic situation this direction is obtained from the solution of the equation of motion in the wave current bed boundary layer fredsøe 1984 the wave wind parameters are actually not identical at points i 1 and i 1 these superficial parameters were however assumed to be the same due to a relatively short distance between the points the soil porosity n was assumed equal to 0 4 due to some discontinuities and errors in the wind or wave records time periods of available data were divided into shorter time series the results of the calculations are presented in table 3 all values of δh are positive which denotes local growth of the water depth erosion of the sea bed this results from greater net sediment transport rates q net i 1 than q net i 1 generated by wave current impact assumed to be identical at points i 1 and i 1 obviously for given wind and wave conditions the intensity of nearbed flow of water and sediment is inversely proportional to water depth q net h 1 the obtained potential sea bed changes are very small and rarely exceed 0 1 m even for the periods amounting to tens of days the value of 0 88 m in the period from september 19 2006 to january 29 2007 constitutes an exception and is most probably related to the long lasting extreme storm conditions in the end of october and beginning of november 2006 as well as in january 2007 during those storm events the significant wave height h s in many data series exceeded 3 m and the wind velocity w sea attained values of 20 22 m s 4 final remarks and conclusions the theoretical modelling presented in this paper yielded lithodynamic and morphodynamic features of the non tidal sea bed at locations beyond the conventionally defined depth of closure the obtained rates of potential sea bed evolution seem realistic values of a few centimetres per month yield annual quantities of tens of centimetres which coincides with field observations of the south baltic sea bed dynamics in the remote foreshore bathymetric surveys carried out there have revealed appearance and migration of large bed forms similar to those frequently encountered in tidal seas the present theoretical findings are helpful in identification of mechanisms generating so distinct bottom level changes at relatively significant depths of the non tidal basins hence a serious gap in knowledge on dynamics of the non tidal sea bed beyond the depth of closure has been filled in in particular it is now clear that the joint impact of waves and wind in storm conditions can cause the relatively intensive nearbed motion of sandy sediments in the remote foreshore it appears among others that storm conditions generating high rate sediment motion namely the sheet flow with θ max 0 9 last for 8 of the time the sediment transport rate modelled for stormy wave current conditions extreme in the period of measurements attains the value of 145 8 10 5 m3 s m in the long term period subject to analysis comprising 47 sub periods the maximum sediment transport rates exceed 100 10 5 m3 s m and 50 10 5 m3 s m three times and seven times respectively spatial variability of sediment transport rates determined using the theoretical model proves sufficient on the strength of the continuity equation for sediment i e eq 5 to generate distinct sea bed changes with the maximum value of 0 21 m month for the site considered the synergic nonlinear interaction of wave induced nearbed oscillatory flows and wind driven currents during storms results in sediment transport of high rate although the intensive wave wind conditions have an instantaneous character in the scale of years or decades the visible long term lithodynamic effects can be reproduced theoretically the potential sea bed changes at depth of about 18 m rarely exceed 0 1 m even for the periods amounting to tens of days the extreme sea bed changes in the remote foreshore are caused by storm events and can reach almost 1 m although the present approach is slightly biased by the model simplifications and assumptions the obtained computational results seem quantitatively reasonable within further research it would be interesting for instance to investigate real sea bed dynamics at location of interest and undertake an attempt to model the sea bottom evolution under actual wind wave conditions the presented modelling approach can be helpful in assessment of potential sea bed changes at locations of planned maritime engineering ventures theoretical quantitative estimation of sea bed dynamics in the remote foreshore can be applied for instance in forecasting of silting up of the mining pits e g in borrow areas of sediment used for artificial shore nourishment credit authorship contribution

21822,the paper presents results of considerations on possibility of bottom sandy sediment transport in the south baltic remote foreshore under waves and currents the analysis is based on theoretical modelling of nearbed motion of water and sand in conditions defined by the long term wave wind climate the wave and wind data were collected near lubiatowo poland the study site represents the area of hydrodynamics and lithodynamics typical of the south baltic coast built of fine sands the wind velocities and directions were measured at the coastal research station crs in lubiatowo while the wave data were collected near crs lubiatowo 1 2 nm from the shoreline at the depth of 15 20 m theoretical studies comprise nearbed wave induced oscillatory velocities wind induced currents and wave current interactions the flow velocities constitute the input for determination of the bed shear stresses the computational results expressed in terms of the dimensionless shear stresses values of shields parameter imply a potential possibility of intensive nearbed sand transport under extreme wave wind conditions the analysis shows that the sea bed lithodynamics under respective rare conditions can yield significant short term bottom level changes in the long term scale keywords wave wind climate wave induced nearbed velocities wind driven current bed shear stresses motion of sandy sediments 1 introduction sediment transport rates and sea bottom level changes depend on intensity of nearbed hydrodynamic impacts in nearshore regions particularly in the surf zone the dominant forces of sediment transport are wave induced orbital velocities together with wave driven currents the further in seaward direction the weaker influence of these factors becomes beyond the surf zone water flow near the sea bed can be related with currents typically occurring in the open sea in the remote foreshore of the south baltic sea namely at depths of a dozen or so metres as proved by ostrowski et al 2018 and stella et al 2019 motion of sandy sediments is driven mostly by wind driven currents accompanied by nearbed wave induced oscillatory flows at those locations however high rate sediment transport can take place only under severe storm conditions which occur rarely a question arises whether such rare hydrodynamic and lithodynamic phenomena can result in noticeable short term evolution of the sea bed in the long term scale a so called depth of closure h c is conventionally assumed to be a seaward boundary of the sea bed changes dean 2002 at location of the depth of closure even extremely high waves are said not to cause intensive sediment transport the respective extreme wave conditions are most often represented by the effective significant deep water wave height h es0 as that is exceeded only 12 h per year or 0 137 of the time simple formulas derived by birkemeier 1985 or earlier by hallermeier 1978 1981 enabling assessment of the depth of closure h c from the effective deep water significant wave height h es0 and period t es0 are discussed e g by dean 2002 obviously the depth of closure h c can be determined directly from bathymetric changes if only sufficient data are available from the deep water wave parameters measured at the ibw pan coastal research station crs in lubiatowo in 2006 2015 cerkowniak et al 2015a determined h es0 3 8 m and t es0 9 75 s these quantities yielded the depth of closure h c to be equal to 7 6 m some investigations shows however that there are many proves of sediment motion at bigger depths see rudowski et al 2008 kubacka et al 2016 and uścinowicz et al 2014 for example large bed forms have been observed at depths of 15 30 m along the shores of the south baltic sea in the micro tidal basins with similar hydrodynamic environment the significant seabed changes beyond the depth of closure were also observed for example unexpected huge bottom changes occurred at hujeong beach south korea during storm conditions with high waves and strong currents occurring simultaneously for 2 3 days seabed eroded around 0 7 m do j d et al 2019 the most interesting aspect of these findings is that this kind of bed forms is typical for tide dominated basins such as the north sea see carbajal and montaño 2001 mccave 1971 terwindt 1971 hulscher and van den brink 2001 the bering sea field et al 1981 the shelf of japan ikehara and kinoshita 1994 the shelf located in the vicinity of nova scotia canada li and king 2007 valentine et al 2002 or the irish sea van landeghem et al 2009 the occurrence of very large subaqueous dunes in the non tidal or micro tidal seas is also observed albeit less frequently for example in the southern ebro continental shelf western mediterranean sea several large scale bed forms were found iacono et al 2010 in the valencia continental shelf spain the bathymetry measurements show evidence of wave and current sediment resuspension during a major storm event with a three year recurrence period simarro et al 2015 the formation of subaqueous bed forms on the outer shelf has been related to unidirectional flows produced by ocean currents accelerated by the presence of morphological constraints ikehara and kinoshita 1994 by seasonal monsoon winds kubicki 2008 by strong geostrophic currents along the shelf break gardner et al 2007 or by sinking of cold and dense water masses lykousis 2001 and in some cases by wave energy as a secondary factor iacono et al 2010 the formation genesis of such features in non tidal sea such as baltic sea cannot be identified it should be also highlighted that the analysis of the cross shore profiles near crs lubiatowo cerkowniak et al 2015a 2015b indicates sea bed changes between two measurements at bigger depths h than the calculated depth of closure h c as mentioned before transport of sandy sediments in the remote foreshore during heavy storms is caused by joint impact of waves and wind according to the findings of stella et al 2019 for the site considered only synergic nonlinear interaction of wave induced nearbed oscillatory flows and wind driven currents under extreme stormy conditions can result in high rate nearbed sediment motion further the sediment transport rates obtained by stella et al 2019 for the stormiest analysed period of measurements appeared sufficiently high to result in sea bed level changes the intensive wave wind hydrodynamic conditions however have an instantaneous character in the scale of a year it is unknown whether these conditions given their relatively short duration can explain distinct evolution of the sea bottom it can be supposed that the extreme wave current conditions occurring repeatedly in longer time scales e g over several years cause significant sea bed changes including the appearance and migration of bed forms clarification of this issue is the aim of the present study the main objective of the paper is to give some estimations of potential sea bed level changes beyond the depth of closure in the non tidal sea using long term measured wind wave parameters to this end theoretical sediment transport model is applied together with the continuity equation for sediment 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and data the present study is based on theoretical investigation supported by data that comprises measurements of the wind and wave parameters from january 02 1997 to october 2 2018 the measurements were carried out by the institute of hydro engineering of the polish academy of sciences ibw pan using scientific instruments located at the ibw pan coastal research station crs in lubiatowo and its vicinity the study area of crs lubiatowo is situated on the middle east polish coast see fig 1 the hydrodynamics lithodynamics and morphodynamics in the study area are typical of the south baltic sandy coast see ostrowski et al 2016 uścinowicz szarafin 2019 the sea shore near lubiatowo is mildly sloped with an inclination of 1 2 and consists of fine quartz sand cross shore bathymetric profiles display 3 4 stable bars and an ephemeral one occurring close to the shoreline such a multi bar profile of the sea bottom is favourable to gradual wave energy dissipation through multiple wave breaking see pruszak et al 2008 the exemplary cross shore bottom profiles at crs lubiatowo together with the depth of closure determined by cerkowniak et al 2015a and location of the measuring equipment are shown in fig 2 series of measured wind parameters reveal short discontinuities amounting to few percent of the considered 22 year period of measurements january 02 1997 october 02 2018 discontinuities in wave records are longer and in total amount to 42 of the considered time frame the available series of wave parameters are given in table 1 and presented graphically in fig 3 the deep water wave measurements were carried out at 15 20 m water depth using the directional waverider buoys dwr 9 mk ii and dwr 7 mk iii moored at a distance of about 1 2 nm from the shoreline most often at about 54 50 n and 17 50 e at 18 m water depth the measurements of water surface elevations by the devices are accurate to 0 01 m and they are carried out with a frequency of 2 56 hz the statistical and stochastic wave parameters are determined once per hour on the basis of time series not shorter than 20 min these results together with raw data are stored in the buoy logger as well as transmitted by radio to a receiver and a computer located in the crs lubiatowo building some basic data are periodically transmitted as smss to a receiving computer at the ibw pan headquarters in gdańsk the wind data namely direction and speed averaged over 10 min and maximum gust in 10 min were collected by a cup anemometer sw 48 produced by mors poland installed on a 22 m mast the mast is located on land close to crs lubiatowo 54 48 70 n 17 50 43 e at a distance of about 150 m from the shoreline the anemometer is installed a few metres above the upper branches of nearby trees the location of the anemometer does not satisfy standards of meteorological monitoring and the measurements of wind parameters particularly velocity are biased although the mast is 12 m higher than stipulated by the standards 10 m the increased terrain roughness due to the presence of trees results in the recorded wind speed being smaller than it would be over a flat ground without trees or other obstacles as required at state meteorological stations in poland secondly wind parameters at sea differ from wind parameters on land this problem was already faced and solved by ostrowski et al 2018 who formulated the following equation representing the relationship between the land wind velocity w land at crs lubiatowo and the sea wind velocity w sea at the 10 m height above the sea level 1 w s e a 1 76 w l a n d 1 92 grain size distribution analysis based on the samples taken from the sea bottom at the deep water locations in the vicinity of the wave buoy show that the sediment is well sorted and the grain diameter d 50 is equal to about 0 13 mm the sea bed sand density of the samples is typical for quartz sand and amounts to ρ s 2650 kg m3 according to observations carried out by divers the sea bottom is mostly flat sandy bed forms occur at some locations only these small bed forms ripple marks have heights and lengths of about 5 15 cm and 1 2 m respectively deep water wave parameters measured by the wave buoys namely the wave height period and direction of propagation as well as the wind direction were used directly while the wind velocity vales w land were recalculated to w sea using eq 1 all of these data together with the sea bed sand features constituted the input to the theoretical model of bed shear stresses and sediment transport under coupled impact of waves and wind induced currents 2 2 theoretical model modelling of hydrodynamic and lithodynamic processes was carried out using the theoretical approach of stella et al 2019 within the applied modelling system the non linear interaction of wind driven currents and nearbed wave induced oscillatory flows is taken into account solution of the momentum equation in the wave current bed boundary layer yields hydrodynamic parameters including bed shear stresses constituting the input to the sediment transport model the most important elements of the applied theoretical approach are briefly described below while the detailed description can be found in stella et al 2019 the wind driven current velocity in the surface layer is calculated on the basis of the wind speed w sea as follows u surface 0 03w sea for w sea 8 m s 2 u surface 0 035w sea for w sea 8 m s knowing the superficial velocity u surface under the assumption of the logarithmic vertical distribution of the wind driven current velocity the friction velocity and the shear stress related to the water flow can be determined to this end the bottom roughness k n a so called nikuradse roughness should be known for the flat sea bed the value of k n is assumed equal to the skin roughness k n 2 5d 50 while for the bottom covered with bed forms ripples the roughness k n is assumed to be represented by the ripple height k n k f in the present study the ripple height was assumed equal to the mean magnitude of sea bed forms observed at the study site k f 0 1 m this value was used as k n in the model runs an additional hydrodynamic effect that appears as a roughness for the steady flow due to occurrence of wave bed boundary layer see e g nielsen 2009 was also included in the modelling this roughness called the apparent bottom roughness k a causes that the flow above the wave boundary layer appears to feel larger roughness than the natural roughness of the rippled bed after confrontation of the theoretical flow velocity profiles with the measured ones stella et al 2019 distinguished wave and current dominated flows depending on the value of the apparent roughness k a the wind driven current is dominant when k a is below 0 13 m in this case the mean flow velocity profile in the water column is determined by the logarithmic distribution the wave flow predominates under conditions in which k a is bigger than 0 13 m in such a case the two layer mean velocity profile is valid namely the logarithmic distribution in the nearbed layer and the linear distribution higher in the water column the equation of motion in the wave current bed boundary layer is solved using the integral momentum model of fredsøe 1984 the model yields among others coupled wave current friction velocities u f t variable during the wave period consequently the dimensionless bed shear stresses θ t are calculated by the following formula see e g nielsen 2009 3 θ t u f t 2 ρ s ρ 1 g d 50 in which ρ is the density of water and g denotes acceleration due to gravity the bed shear stresses ρu f 2 generated by waves and currents are the driving forces for motion of sediments building the sea bottom sediment transport rates q t per unit width m3 s m are determined by the three layer model of kaczmarek and ostrowski 2002 integration of these instantaneous rates over the wave period t yields the net resultant sediment transport rate q net 4 q n e t 1 t 0 t q t d t spatial variability of sediment transport rate q net is a direct reason for accumulative and erosive processes occurring at the sea bed conventionally the evolution of the sea bed profile expressed as changes of the water depth h is determined from the following continuity equation for sediment in the direction x of the net rate q net vector 5 h x t t 1 1 n q n e t x t x where n denotes the soil porosity while deposited x is the coordinate related to the axis lying on the q net direction and t stands for the time the net sediment transport rate vector results from wave current interaction in the bed boundary layer under instantaneous hydrodynamic conditions and its direction can be arbitrary with respect to the shore solving eq 5 is not a problem e g by a finite difference scheme for sediment transport rates q net i 1 and q net i 1 determined at points i 1 and i 1 respectively it can be calculated that the water depth change δh i at a point i located in the middle between the points i 1 and i 1 in time δt amounts to 6 δ h i 1 1 n δ q n e t 2 δ x δ t 1 1 n δ t 2 δ x q n e t i 1 q n e t i 1 where 2δx is a distance between the points i 1 and i 1 within the above finite difference scheme variability of q net in each time step δt is neglected as the hydrodynamic conditions does not change rapidly and the time step δt amounts to 0 5 3 h the value of q net can be assumed constant during this time the above modelling system was applied to determine bed shear stresses sediment transport rates and potential possible short term changes of sea bottom level in the remote foreshore during the extreme wave current conditions occurring in the long time scale namely in the period from january 02 1997 to october 02 2018 3 results and discussion the maximum during wave period in combined wave current motion dimensionless bed shear stresses θ max calculated by formula 3 are given in table 2 it appears that during the analysed period intensive sediment motion sheet flow for θ max 0 9 lasts for 8 of the time the same duration namely 8 concerns the moderately intensive sediment motion when θ max is higher than 0 6 but lower than 0 9 these two regimes correspond to the flat bed and the ripple height decrease respectively the regime that cause the ripples appearance on the sea bed for 0 05 θ max 0 3 lasts for 45 of the time while the development of the ripples 0 3 θ max 0 6 takes place over 19 of the analysed period in order to determine the potential changes of sea bottom level at i th point δh i in the study area eq 6 was applied sediment transport rates were calculated in two points first at h 18 m i 1 point and second at h 17 m depth i 1 point within the research area a bottom profile segment was identified along which the 1 m depth change from 18 m to 17 m took place over a distance of around 150 m therefore 2δx 150 m was assumed although the respective bottom profile segment lies approximately parallel to the shoreline the points i 1 and i 1 are assumed to be located in the direction of the resultant sediment transport q net induced by wave current motion during each hydrodynamic situation this direction is obtained from the solution of the equation of motion in the wave current bed boundary layer fredsøe 1984 the wave wind parameters are actually not identical at points i 1 and i 1 these superficial parameters were however assumed to be the same due to a relatively short distance between the points the soil porosity n was assumed equal to 0 4 due to some discontinuities and errors in the wind or wave records time periods of available data were divided into shorter time series the results of the calculations are presented in table 3 all values of δh are positive which denotes local growth of the water depth erosion of the sea bed this results from greater net sediment transport rates q net i 1 than q net i 1 generated by wave current impact assumed to be identical at points i 1 and i 1 obviously for given wind and wave conditions the intensity of nearbed flow of water and sediment is inversely proportional to water depth q net h 1 the obtained potential sea bed changes are very small and rarely exceed 0 1 m even for the periods amounting to tens of days the value of 0 88 m in the period from september 19 2006 to january 29 2007 constitutes an exception and is most probably related to the long lasting extreme storm conditions in the end of october and beginning of november 2006 as well as in january 2007 during those storm events the significant wave height h s in many data series exceeded 3 m and the wind velocity w sea attained values of 20 22 m s 4 final remarks and conclusions the theoretical modelling presented in this paper yielded lithodynamic and morphodynamic features of the non tidal sea bed at locations beyond the conventionally defined depth of closure the obtained rates of potential sea bed evolution seem realistic values of a few centimetres per month yield annual quantities of tens of centimetres which coincides with field observations of the south baltic sea bed dynamics in the remote foreshore bathymetric surveys carried out there have revealed appearance and migration of large bed forms similar to those frequently encountered in tidal seas the present theoretical findings are helpful in identification of mechanisms generating so distinct bottom level changes at relatively significant depths of the non tidal basins hence a serious gap in knowledge on dynamics of the non tidal sea bed beyond the depth of closure has been filled in in particular it is now clear that the joint impact of waves and wind in storm conditions can cause the relatively intensive nearbed motion of sandy sediments in the remote foreshore it appears among others that storm conditions generating high rate sediment motion namely the sheet flow with θ max 0 9 last for 8 of the time the sediment transport rate modelled for stormy wave current conditions extreme in the period of measurements attains the value of 145 8 10 5 m3 s m in the long term period subject to analysis comprising 47 sub periods the maximum sediment transport rates exceed 100 10 5 m3 s m and 50 10 5 m3 s m three times and seven times respectively spatial variability of sediment transport rates determined using the theoretical model proves sufficient on the strength of the continuity equation for sediment i e eq 5 to generate distinct sea bed changes with the maximum value of 0 21 m month for the site considered the synergic nonlinear interaction of wave induced nearbed oscillatory flows and wind driven currents during storms results in sediment transport of high rate although the intensive wave wind conditions have an instantaneous character in the scale of years or decades the visible long term lithodynamic effects can be reproduced theoretically the potential sea bed changes at depth of about 18 m rarely exceed 0 1 m even for the periods amounting to tens of days the extreme sea bed changes in the remote foreshore are caused by storm events and can reach almost 1 m although the present approach is slightly biased by the model simplifications and assumptions the obtained computational results seem quantitatively reasonable within further research it would be interesting for instance to investigate real sea bed dynamics at location of interest and undertake an attempt to model the sea bottom evolution under actual wind wave conditions the presented modelling approach can be helpful in assessment of potential sea bed changes at locations of planned maritime engineering ventures theoretical quantitative estimation of sea bed dynamics in the remote foreshore can be applied for instance in forecasting of silting up of the mining pits e g in borrow areas of sediment used for artificial shore nourishment credit authorship contribution

21823,vector control technology with single joystick for ship maneuvering is investigated on waterjet propelled crafts for excellent maneuverability and easy manipulation in this paper a vector control strategy of ship motion based on synchronous thrust adjustment of two waterjets with mirror equiangular magnitude which takes the hull cross section as the benchmark was selected firstly then

operation conditions of waterjet propelled crafts such as berthing entering and leaving port position operations at sea and tactical maneuver to improve the maneuverability and safety of ships in addition the vector control function can also be applied to the motion control module for low speed maneuvering condition of smart ship keywords ship maneuvering waterjet propulsion vector control thrust control strategy cfd model test 1 introduction practice shows that the crafts propelled by two waterjets have the function of resultant thrust vector adjusting in 360 making it possible to achieve various complex maneuvers of the hull such as lateral movement effective application of these maneuvers is helpful to improve the safety of ship maneuvering at low speed conditions such as berthing un berthing entering and leaving the port the operation is complex and difficult to achieve such ship maneuvering with traditional propulsion control system because multiple parameters such as rotational speeds steering angles and reverse bucket angles of two sets of propulsion plants need to be controlled synchronously borrett et al 2008 ding et al 2008 chang et al 2010 hu et al 2011 at present more and more operating systems are used for integrated control of main engine steering gear side thruster and other equipment on ships with higher degree of automation which has become a core technology and an important development direction in the field of ship propulsion control the joystick vector control system for waterjet propelled crafts is one of the ship integrated control system to reduce the difficulty of driver s operation the research on vector control in term of building vector correspondence between joystick operations and hull motions can contribute to explore the potential on excellent maneuvering of waterjet propelled ship and to control the ship in an easier and safer way hamiltonjet company 2000 marine jet power company 2000 the ship dynamic positioning dp system is a typical ship integrated control system which is fully automatic and has received a lot of attention in recent decades generally dynamic positioning dp ships are usually propelled by pod propulsors and the dp system is used for optimal control of multiple podded propellers although the object of vector control system for dynamic positioning ship is different from the system for waterjet propelled crafts the relevant control theories and methods can be referenced fossen and johansen 2006 proposed that the ship control and thrust allocation problem can be formulated as an optimization problem his research presented several thrust models of different types of marine thrusters and divides the ship control and thrust allocation problem into several different optimization problems with or without constraints and linearity millan 2010 conducted research on the thrust allocation method of dynamic positioning ship in his paper a model of ship thrust allocation without considering hydrodynamic effects was used to transform the ship thrust allocation of dynamic positioning into an optimization problem and the corresponding mathematical expression several various methods to solve the problem of thrust allocation optimization were given and some of them are simulated to verify their feasibility his mathematical model of dp ship provides a reference for waterjet propelled crafts in recent years more and more attention has been paid to intelligent marine vehicles a number of researchers focus on the research of heading control used on the underactuated vessels zhen and jing 2012 present a disturbance compensating model predictive control dc mpc method for vessel heading control in the framework of mpc the proposed method can handle yaw velocity and actuator saturation constraints very well lokukaluge and carlos 2012 introduces a pre filtered sliding mode control for vessel heading control with a nonlinear vessel steering system the simulation results show that the proposed method has better performance than the pid controller under external disturbances xian ku et al 2018 presents a linear reduced backstepping algorithm to solve the problems of high output energy and difficult cancellation of nonlinear function in the backstepping algorithm for vessel heading control the simulation results exhibit that the proposed method has better energy

vessel to the task area fossen et al 2015 proposed a nonlinear adaptive path following controller that can compensate for drift forces by estimating sideslip the simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method lu liu et al 2016 proposed a predictor based on line of sight plos guidance law for the path following of underactuated marine surface vehicles and a predictor is designed to estimate the sideslip generated by unknown environment disturbance lu liu et al 2017 proposed a reduced order extended state observer eso to identify the vehicle s sideslip angle the proposed eso is incorporated in the line of sight guidance law to guarantee that the vessel converges to the predefined path vector control technology can be incorporating with path guidance law for vessel path following control and due to the character of vector control more potential heading controller and path following controller can be designed as for the vector control system for waterjet propelled crafts there are also a number of researches which have been done borrett and rae 2008 explored the application of waterjet in different dynamic positioning ships and gave suggestions on the hydrodynamic design of waterjet mounted on different types of ships the thrust envelope of a single waterjet was also drawn according to the theoretical calculation formula of the waterjet thruster according to the thrust envelope the control system and the thrust distribution of the waterjet propulsors when it is applied to the dynamically positioned ship are briefly discussed but they had not discussed further about the construction of waterjet thrust model hu et al 2011 researched translational maneuvering method of a dual waterjet propelled craft and proposed a control method that adjusting the operating parameters with angle of the opposite direction but of the same magnitude by two handles the thrust model of waterjet in this paper is simpli fied and there is no process of control optimization which can make the result obtained faster but limits the range of the thrust envelope generated by waterjets jointly xiaoyin et al 2017 carried out the research of joystick vector control system for dual waterjet propelled crafts and established the mathematical model of the motion of double waterjet ship according the simulation of thrust distribution optimization was done by cascade generalized inverse thrust allocation algorithm and automatic offset method respectively however they only considering the thrust allocation without further analysis of the joint action between each component of waterjet yufan 2017 took the double waterjet ship as the object of study established a three degree of freedom motion control model based on the fuzzy pid control method and the ship maneuverability equation proposed by the japanese maneuverability motion mathematical model seminar group mmg he supposed that compared with the conventional pid control method this method has the advantages of faster response speed and stronger anti interference ability zuti et al 2018 studied the thrust vector control system of high pressure sub waterjet propulsion but the structure of high pressure sub waterjet is quite distinct from conventional waterjet propulsion the methodology adopted by the authors for developing vector control system of ship maneuvering under low speed conditions and the results of vector control tests on scale model are presented in this article through the vector control model established in this paper the crew driver can complete the vector control of ship maneuvering by only controlling a joystick which simplifies the difficulty of operation and increases the accuracy of manipulation in the actual maneuvering process the crew driver first controls the joystick according to the motion of ship and then the three operation parameters of the joystick are assigned through computer analysis and calculation the six parameters of the port and starboard propulsion devices are obtained then by means of the combination of the six control variables the expected movement of the hull can be achieved by controlling its three parameters 2 technical scheme of developing vector control system 2 1 control mode of vector control vector control function is primarily used for ship maneuvering under low speed conditions such as ship berthing where the parameters of vessel attitude and surrounding environment change rapidly if vector control system was based on full automatic control mode it would rely on a large number of sensor and largely demands on quick response high accuracy and reliability of the control system however the high development cost and unfavorable product price may limit its wide application in waterjet propelled ships in addition if ships were completely handed over to the full automatic control system there may be also potential safety risks in the operation of complex ship motions such as docks in rough conditions and environments in this article the closed loop control mode is adopted to develop vector control system as shown in fig 1 where the crew driver is involved in the control with highly developed sensory functions and intelligence of human beings drivers can give effective ship maneuvering response in time according to the targets on motion direction motion velocity and heading angle of the vessel in the actual working process three target parameters of hull motion are determined by the crew driver according to the expected motion of the ship based on the motion of the joystick three manipulation parameters are input to the computer for analysis and calculation with vector control algorithm the calculated six operating parameters of propulsors are output to six actuators of two sets of waterjets respectively to control the hull motion because of the disturbance of wind wave and current the actual motion parameters of the hull and the target parameters of the hull may not be consistent frequently when the ship deviates from its desired trajectory due to external disturbances the crew driver can observe the yaw situation and the direction of ship motion to modify the operation action so that the hull can achieve the desired motion and realize the vector control function 2 2 thrust allocation strategy in ship maneuvering the required ship motions are achieved by controlling thrust magnitude and thrust direction of two waterjets the thrust allocation strategy of two thrusters has a significant influence on ship motion in low speed conditions the range of roll heave and pitch motion of the hull is small which has little influence on waterjet thrust and thus can be neglected various kinds of ship motions can be treated as a combination of translational motion and yaw motion the thrust allocation analysis is carried out mainly for such two basic motions the thrust allocation strategy discussed in this section draws on the translation maneuvering method established in hu desheng s paper 2011 and carries out the hull force analysis under each typical motion condition according to the train of thought and understanding in this paper 2 2 1 maneuvering strategy of translational motion translational motion includes lateral motion and oblique motion lateral motion is very useful at low speed conditions such as berthing unberthing entering and leaving the port in order to improve the lateral motion and make its manipulation process easier to understand the control of two waterjets are based on synchronous thrust adjustment with mirror symmetric thrust direction taking right lateral motion as example the starboard waterjet works in reverse condition producing reversing force t 2 with an deflection angle ϕ to the right as shown in fig 2 a while the port waterjet works in forward condition producing forward thrust t 1 with an deflection angle ϕ to the left the magnitude of reverse thrust t 2 is equal to the forward thrust t 1 and the direction of t 2 is mirror symmetric with that of t 1 taking the hull cross section at the rotation centre as the benchmark the symbol of ϕ shown in fig 2 a is the intersection angle between thrust and axial line of ship while the symbol of φ is the intersection angle between the installation position of waterjet and the axis of hull when the combined thrust of two waterjets acts on the mass centre of ship ϕ and φ are equal forward thrust t 1 and reversing thrust t 2 form a resultant force t which pushing the hull to move right lateral when the intersection point of resultant force with mid ship line and the rotation centre of hull rotate are overlapped the speed of lateral motion can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing t 1 and t 2 in the same ratio while the waterjet nozzle direction remains unchanged and only two waterjet pump speed should be changed at the same time as to left sideways motion similar strategy is adopted in such case the port waterjet operates on reverse condition while the starboard waterjet works on forward condition on the basis of lateral motion oblique motion of ship in various directions can be achieved by turning the ratio of t 1 to t 2 for example on the basis of right lateral motion shown in fig 2 a the ship will move front right by increasing rotational speed and corresponding forward thrust of port waterjet and keeping the rotational speed of starboard waterjet unchanged while the thrust direction of two waterjets both remain same and their resultant thrust t turns to front right the direction angle α between the resultant force t and midship line can be adjusted by changing the ratio of t 1 to t 2 as shown in fig 2 b 2 2 2 maneuvering strategy of heading control in the environment of wind wave and current the heading adjustment is required to keep the translational motion of hull steady taking the right lateral motion for example the heading of hull can be controlled by means of the method illustrated in fig 3 if the bow of hull deflects clockwise the heading can be adjusted by increasing synchronously the direction angle ϕ of forward thrust t 1 and reverse thrust t 2 at same level the resultant thrust t still facing to right moves δ l towards astern which generate a counter clockwise yaw moment m l equal to t δ l about the rotational centre of hull as shown in fig 3 a analogously when the heading of hull deflects to the left decreasing synchronously the direction angle ϕ of forward thrust t 1 and reverse thrust t 2 at same level will result in a clockwise yaw moment m r equals to t δ l to correct the heading direction in such case the resultant thrust t moves δ l towards the bow as shown in fig 3 b furthermore on the basis of the above operation increasing the rotational speed of the waterjet pump on both sides simultaneously can increase the resultant force of the two waterjet thrusters thereby increasing the regulating yaw moment and vice versa this operation is shown in fig 3 c on the other hand when the steering nozzles of both sides of waterjet are maintained in the median position the reverse bucket of one side is retracted and the other side is put down the hull can rotate in situ as shown in fig 3 d 3 mathematical model of vector control crew driver manipulates the joystick to control the operating parameters of two waterjets according to the algorithm in computer and the waterjets control ship motion by adjusting their thrusts synchronously to establish the vector correspondence relationship between joystick operations and ship motions mathematical modeling of vector control is needed to build the relationship between manipulation parameters of joystick and operation parameters of two waterjets which provide the theory for computer programming the modeling includes two works one is to obtain the relationship between manipulating parameters of joystick and ship motions another one is to build the relationship between ship motions and waterjet operating parameters the vector control model is shown in fig 4 as for the first work to obtain the relationship between joystick and ship motions the following three requirements should be met firstly the phase angle of joystick and the motion direction angle α of required thrust t should be consistency secondly the inclination angle γ of joystick should be proportional to the ship thrust t which corresponds to the speed of the ship motion v s thirdly the rotation angle τ of joystick should be proportional to the yaw moment m that adjusts ship bow heading angle σ the maximum value of t is determined according to the cavitation limitation on rotational speed of reversing waterjet in mooring condition the maximum value of m is calculated regarding the range of t and the installation position of waterjet on craft the second work is critical to the model of vector control which contains two steps the first step is to calculate separately the thrust values and thrust directions of two waterjets according to the ship motion parameters where the thrust allocation strategy established in the section 2 2 needs to be applied the second step is to calculate the operating parameters of waterjets according to allocated thrust which is introduced in the following section 3 1 to section 3 2 3 1 calculation of operating parameters for single waterjet the thrust of waterjet is regulated horizontally by changing the injection angle of the steering nozzle of the waterjet in the horizontal direction while the reverse regulation of the thrust is realized by the retractable bucket thrust is equal to the rate of momentum change per unit time after the water passes through the waterjet propulsor the thrust can be obtained indirectly based on the momentum flow method raised by van terwisga 2005 in 24th ittc when the steering nozzle angle is zero according to the law of momentum the waterjet thrust t can be expressed as 1 t ρ q v j v i where q is the flow rate of the waterjet v j is the jet velocity at nozzle v i is the inflow velocity beneath the hull and ρ is the density of water fig 5 shows the inlet flow and jet flow of single waterjet the jet velocity of the outlet surface of waterjet nozzle can be calculated by the suction flow rate of the waterjet 2 v j q s n o z o u t where s n o z o u t is the area of nozzle outlet as vector control is used for maneuvering control of ships at low speed the inlet velocity of the waterjet v i in the formulas mentioned above can be approximated to zero to simplify the analysis thus the relationship between the waterjet thrust and the suction flow rate of the waterjet can be simplified as shown in eq 3 3 t ρ q 2 s n o z o u t the m type reverse bucket is widely used on small and medium size waterjets the fluid flow and related force are sketched in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the waterjet is in reverse condition θ is the nozzle steering angle while ξ is the angle between the outlet on one side of reverse bucket and the central axis of waterjet which is a constant value for a certain type waterjet t r is the reversing thrust produced by a single waterjet in axial direction which is composed by the reaction forces t r l and ω w r produced by the water on the two side of the reverse bucket if approximately assumed that the flow rate inside two branched passage of reverse bucket changes linearly with nozzle steering angle θ the flow rate at the left outlet of the reverse bucket q r l can be calculated according to eq 4 4 q r l 1 2 q 1 θ θ max where θ max is the maximum steering angle of the nozzle and θ θ max θ max the flow rate at the right outlet of the reverse bucket q r r can be obtained in the similar way based on the function relationship between flow rate and waterjet thrust established by eq 3 t r l can be obtained by eq 5 and the thrust t r r can be obtained in the similar way 5 t r l ρ q r l 2 s r o u t s n o z o u t v j θ max θ 2 θ max 2 ρ s r o u t η cos β where η is the energy utilization efficiency in order to consider the flow loss of water passing through nozzles reverse buckets and other components of waterjet s r o u t is cross sectional area of the one side outlet of reverse bucket moreover β is the angle between the horizontal plane and the forward jet flow of water in the reverse bucket which is also a constant value for a certain type waterjet according to the structural characteristics of reverse bucket and steering nozzle in fig 6 the force analysis is carried out based on triangle geometry theorem eq 6 and eq 7 can be obtained 6 t r l t r r sin ξ ϕ sin ξ ϕ 7 t r t r l 2 t r r 2 2 t r l t r r cos π 2 ξ ρ s n o z o u t 2 v j 2 4 θ max 2 s r o u t η cos β θ max θ 4 θ max θ 4 2 θ max θ 2 θ max θ 2 cos 2 ξ where t r is the reversing force of single waterjet resultant force hence combining eq 5 eq 6 and eq 7 eq 8 can be obtained 8 sin ξ ϕ sin ξ ϕ θ max θ θ max θ 2 thus the equation for calculating the steering angle of waterjet nozzle can be obtained by transformation as shown in eq 9 9 θ θ max 2 θ max 1 sin ξ φ sin ξ φ according to engineering experience the flow rate of waterjet is approximately linear with the rotating speed of waterjet pump which is shown as eq 10 this hypothesis is considered reasonable by subsequent numerical simulations of the hydrodynamics of waterjet ships 10 q k n where k is a constant coefficient and n is the rotating speed of waterjet pump based on the above conclusions the equation for calculating the rotating speed of the waterjet pump in reversing condition can be deduced as shown in eq 11 11 n r 1 k 4 s r o u t θ max 2 t r ρ η 1 cos β θ max θ 4 θ max θ 4 2 θ max θ 2 θ max θ 2 cos 2 ξ 1 2 where η 1 is the energy utilization efficiency when the waterjet is in the reverse operating condition on the other hand when the reverse bucket is retracted the waterjet thrust and the rotating speed in the ahead state can also be calculated by the same method the steering angle θ a and rotational speed n a of waterjet in forward condition can be determined by eq 12 and eq 13 12 θ a ϕ 13 n a 1 k t a s n o z o u t ρ η 2 1 2 where t a is the forward thrust produced by a single waterjet in axial direction and η 2 is the energy utilization efficiency when the waterjet is in the ahead operating condition 3 2 thrust allocation of two waterjets for desired ship motions the direction velocity and heading angle of ship motion correspond respectively to the direction angle α magnitude t and corresponding rotation moment m of the resultant thrust of two waterjets a control strategy based on synchronous thrust adjustment of two waterjets with equal angle magnitude as introduced in chapter 2 is selected to allocate the thrusts to meet the thrust requirement for desired ship motions as illustrated in fig 2 the force direction angle ϕ of two waterjets in ahead and reversing operation conditions can be determined according to eq 14 14 ϕ arctan y x m t sin α where as shown in fig 2 ϕ is the intersection angle between thrust and axial line of ship x is the longitudinal distance between rotation centre of ship and the transom plate y is the transversal distance between waterjet installation position and the mid ship line α is the angle between the resultant thrust direction of two waterjets and the mid ship line for example when the ship moves towards right as shown in fig 2 a the left waterjet is in ahead state whose reverse bucket needs to pull up and the right one is in reverse state whose bucket drops down the operation parameters of left waterjet and right waterjet can be calculated by the following formulas 15 left waterjet t w l t a v w l v a n w l n a θ w l θ a 16 right waterjet t w r t r v w r v r n w r n r θ w r θ r where subscript wl denotes the parameters of left waterjet while wr means the parameters of right waterjet according to the sine theorem of force the following formulas can be obtained 17 sin α ϕ 90 t w r sin 270 ϕ α t w l sin 2 ϕ t the following equations can be obtained by conversion of the above formulas 18 t w l t a t sin α ϕ sin 2 ϕ t w r t r t sin α ϕ sin 2 ϕ for a particular ship motion the ahead force t a reversing force t r and their directional angle of two waterjets can be calculated by eq 18 firstly then their respective operating parameters can be obtained by eq 9 eq 11 eq 12 and eq 13 especially when the hull moves in translation there are the following special conditions 19 t w l t w r α 9 0 4 numerical analysis of waterjet thrust in the establishment of the mathematical model of vector control mentioned above some assumptions are adopted such as the linear relationship between the flow rate of waterjet and the rotational speed of waterjet pump which needs to be verified by test or numerical simulation on the other hand there are friction loss and vortex loss in the waterjet which can not be neglected in order to achieve better results of vector control the energy loss coefficient in the mathematical model needs to be calculated reasonably furthermore in order to verify the relevant assumptions in the mathematical model and accurately calculate the energy loss coefficient to ensure the validity of calculation results of the mathematical model numerical simulation of thrust performance of waterjet under ship self propelled condition is carried out by using the cfd computational fluid dynamics solver star ccm in this paper based on the numerical results and analysis the corresponding relationship between thrust vector of single waterjet mass flow of waterjet and pump rotational speed under different working conditions is established and the energy loss coefficients are obtained by interpolating these data the relationship curves between forward thrust reverse thrust and pump rotational speed of waterjet flow rate are drawn under different pump speeds a model of a mono hull craft equipped with two waterjets is used for the numerical simulation and analysis the model craft is 3 80 m and the displacement is 420 kg as the vector control function is mainly used in low speed maneuvering conditions of ships the speed of the craft is 1kn to simulate the ship s maneuvering conditions such as berthing the waterjet units used in the numerical simulations of self propelled motion are designed specially the diameter of the waterjet pump is 0 11 m and the length of the inlet duct is 0 23 m the craft model and its waterjets are shown in fig 7 the numerical simulations are based on the finite volume method fvm based on the rans method the hydrodynamic performances of this craft and its waterjets are simulated the continuity equation and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations in the flow simulations are as follows 21 u i x i 0 22 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j s i where u i and u j are the mean velocity component x i is the i component of coordinate system p is the mean pressure μ is the viscosity coefficient ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress considering the symmetry of the ship which is equipped with two waterjets only half domain of the flow field on the side of the symmetric plane is adopted fig 8 shows the flow field domain and its boundary conditions the s s t k ω turbulence model with wall functions is applied and governing equations are discreted with second order upwind scheme to reduce the transaction errors the volume of fluid vof method and hric format is used to trace the free surface the motion of the hull is calculate based on the method of overset mesh the overset domain which activate the motion function of sinkage and trim include the hulls and the surrounding rectangular domain the length of overset domain is 1 4 times of the hull length while the width is 1 time of the hull beam the rotor of waterjet uses a relative rotation coordinate system mrf to simulate the rotation and injection of the propulsor in this paper the validation of cfd simulations has been carried out on 5 various mesh schemes which takes the condition when nozzle steering angle is 0 and the reverse bucket is retracted as the example table 1 shows the numerical simulation results of different mesh schemes the simulation time steps of all mesh schemes are reduced until the hydrodynamic results no longer change according to the results shown in table 1 the numerical simulations of different conditions adopt no 3 mesh scheme unstructured grids are used to construct the hull surface and its surrounding domain the boundary layer on the wall of the hull and the waterjet duct is simulated with a 10 layers prism grid to keep the value of y in the range of 30 100 the free surface the stern wave and the inlet of the waterjet are all grid densified as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 the rotor and stator of the waterjet are constructed by structural grid through the software turbogrid the surface grid of waterjet rotor and stator is shown in fig 11 fig 12 a shows the jet flow and the waterjet inlet flow of the self propelled craft when the reverse bucket is retracted and the steering nozzle rotates 10 while the reverse bucket is put down and the steering nozzle rotates 15 in fig 12 b as shown in fig 12 b part of the jet flow of the reverse bucket hits the hull stern the calculated operating conditions and their results are shown in fig 13 to fig 16 as shown in the fig 13 of the relationship between suction flow rate of waterjet and rotational speed of waterjet pump the functional relationship between them can be obtained approximately as shown in eq 23 aiming at the waterjet in this paper 23 q 0 009 n 0 008 0 009 n therefore the relationship between the rotational speed of the waterjet pump and the flow rate of the waterjet can be approximated as a linear relationship combined with the relationship between the mass flow and thrust of waterjet shown in fig 14 the mathematical relationship between pump speed and thrust of waterjet can be established it should be noted that the thrust of waterjet mentioned here is the thrust produced by the waterjet pump when it is not affected by the steering nozzle and the reversing bucket which is the ideal thrust mentioned later at a given pump speed moreover as shown in the fig 15 and fig 16 the variation of energy utilization efficiency η under different working conditions can be obtained vector control function is mainly used in low speed conditions and the range of pump speed change is not large during the control process hence the difference of energy utilization efficiency η at different rotating speeds can be ignored approximately functional relationship between energy utilization efficiency η and nozzle steering angle is established approximately as shown in eq 24 24 η 1 9 10 7 θ 4 7 10 5 θ 3 0 0016 θ 2 0 0012 θ 0 9829 η 2 2 10 6 θ 4 0 0001 θ 3 0 0023 θ 2 0 0071 θ 0 6632 where η 1 is the energy utilization efficiency when the waterjet is in the reverse operating condition while η 2 is the energy utilization efficiency when the waterjet is in the ahead operating condition the above cfd numerical analysis shows the rationality of the relevant assumptions in this paper and approximates the expression of energy loss coefficients under different working conditions thus improving the calculation accuracy of the mathematical model of vector control 5 model

industrial computer through the serial port all vector control command including ship motion direction angle α and speed of ship motion v s ship bow heading angle σ can be transformed from the position of the x y axes and the angle of the z axis of the joystick 5 2 translational motion test the tests for translational motion include two types of ship motion namely lateral motion and oblique motion each type of test is repeated three times in the test of lateral motion the crew turns the joystick to the left side and correspondingly the ship moves laterally toward its left direction at the same time the ship heading is adjusted by tuning the heading adjust button on the joystick the snapshots of the ship s lateral motions are shown in fig 19 the moving distances of the ship in the three tests are 9 m the longitudinal position deviation between the tested and expected berthing locations is 0 418 m which is approximately 0 11 times of ship length the effect of control of ship lateral motion is satisfactory in the test of oblique motion the crew turns the joystick to the right front side and correspondingly the ship moves toward its right front direction the snapshots of the ship s oblique motions are shown in fig 20 the errors of ship heading angle during the voyage are less than six degrees the angle deviation between the actual motion track of test and the desired motion tracks is less than 2 1 the results show that the proposed vector control system is effective for the ship oblique motion 5 3 test for motion combining translation and rotation as mentioned previously the control strategy for propulsive force direction is based on adjusting synchronously the steering angles of two propulsion systems mirror equiangularily with this strategy the ship s complex maneuvering which combines translation and rotation such as rectangular tracing motion and fan shaped tracing motion is performed by turning the joystick and tuning the heading control button fig 21 shows the snapshots of the ship moving around a rectangular object in the three repeated tests the deviation of radial distance between the tested navigation track and the expected semicircular track is less than 0 5 m 5 4 vector control test in wave to test the performance of vector control for ship motion in waves model tests of ship moving laterally in regular beam sea are conducted in the towing tank during the tests the vector control system performs well fig 22 show the snapshots of the ship s lateral motions in the case of wave height of 7 cm whose corresponding value is 0 7 m regarding a ship with length of 38 m and is typical in the harbor area 6 conclusion and prospect 1 a mathematical model of vector control for waterjet ship maneuvering with single joystick in low

maneuvering tests such as transverse motion of hull are conducted both in calm water and in wave the proposed vector control function is performed well in these tests the main findings in this research results can be used as technical references for developing vector control system of waterjet propelled vessels 2 the calculated results of waterjet operation parameters are influenced in the vector control mathematical model by some factors such as the distribution characteristics of flow with steering angle and the energy conversion efficiency in the bucket the hydrodynamic data and loss coefficients of ship and waterjet can be obtained approximately by cfd simulation and local correction is still needed in actual operation according to the ship model test results of transversal motion and rotational motion 3 the vector control mathematical model is set up for the m shape bucket where jet flow is split into two parts such model is suitable to most medium and small size

operation conditions of waterjet propelled crafts such as berthing entering and leaving port position operations at sea and tactical maneuver to improve the maneuverability and safety of ships in addition the vector control function can also be applied to the motion control module for low speed maneuvering condition of smart ship keywords ship maneuvering waterjet propulsion vector control thrust control strategy cfd model test 1 introduction practice shows that the crafts propelled by two waterjets have the function of resultant thrust vector adjusting in 360 making it possible to achieve various complex maneuvers of the hull such as lateral movement effective application of these maneuvers is helpful to improve the safety of ship maneuvering at low speed conditions such as berthing un berthing entering and leaving the port the operation is complex and difficult to achieve such ship maneuvering with traditional propulsion control system because multiple parameters such as rotational speeds steering angles and reverse bucket angles of two sets of propulsion plants need to be controlled synchronously borrett et al 2008 ding et al 2008 chang et al 2010 hu et al 2011 at present more and more operating systems are used for integrated control of main engine steering gear side thruster and other equipment on ships with higher degree of automation which has become a core technology and an important development direction in the field of ship propulsion control the joystick vector control system for waterjet propelled crafts is one of the ship integrated control system to reduce the difficulty of driver s operation the research on vector control in term of building vector correspondence between joystick operations and hull motions can contribute to explore the potential on excellent maneuvering of waterjet propelled ship and to control the ship in an easier and safer way hamiltonjet company 2000 marine jet power company 2000 the ship dynamic positioning dp system is a typical ship integrated control system which is fully automatic and has received a lot of attention in recent decades generally dynamic positioning dp ships are usually propelled by pod propulsors and the dp system is used for optimal control of multiple podded propellers although the object of vector control system for dynamic positioning ship is different from the system for waterjet propelled crafts the relevant control theories and methods can be referenced fossen and johansen 2006 proposed that the ship control and thrust allocation problem can be formulated as an optimization problem his research presented several thrust models of different types of marine thrusters and divides the ship control and thrust allocation problem into several different optimization problems with or without constraints and linearity millan 2010 conducted research on the thrust allocation method of dynamic positioning ship in his paper a model of ship thrust allocation without considering hydrodynamic effects was used to transform the ship thrust allocation of dynamic positioning into an optimization problem and the corresponding mathematical expression several various methods to solve the problem of thrust allocation optimization were given and some of them are simulated to verify their feasibility his mathematical model of dp ship provides a reference for waterjet propelled crafts in recent years more and more attention has been paid to intelligent marine vehicles a number of researchers focus on the research of heading control used on the underactuated vessels zhen and jing 2012 present a disturbance compensating model predictive control dc mpc method for vessel heading control in the framework of mpc the proposed method can handle yaw velocity and actuator saturation constraints very well lokukaluge and carlos 2012 introduces a pre filtered sliding mode control for vessel heading control with a nonlinear vessel steering system the simulation results show that the proposed method has better performance than the pid controller under external disturbances xian ku et al 2018 presents a linear reduced backstepping algorithm to solve the problems of high output energy and difficult cancellation of nonlinear function in the backstepping algorithm for vessel heading control the simulation results exhibit that the proposed method has better energy efficiency than standard backstepping method path following is a also crucial issue in vessel motion control in real application fo unmanned surface vessels the path following controller take the vessel to the task area fossen et al 2015 proposed a nonlinear adaptive path following controller that can compensate for drift forces by estimating sideslip the simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method lu liu et al 2016 proposed a predictor based on line of sight plos guidance law for the path following of underactuated marine surface vehicles and a predictor is designed to estimate the sideslip generated by unknown environment disturbance lu liu et al 2017 proposed a reduced order extended state observer eso to identify the vehicle s sideslip angle the proposed eso is incorporated in the line of sight guidance law to guarantee that the vessel converges to the predefined path vector control technology can be incorporating with path guidance law for vessel path following control and due to the character of vector control more potential heading controller and path following controller can be designed as for the vector control system for waterjet propelled crafts there are also a number of researches which have been done borrett and rae 2008 explored the application of waterjet in different dynamic positioning ships and gave suggestions on the hydrodynamic design of waterjet mounted on different types of ships the thrust envelope of a single waterjet was also drawn according to the theoretical calculation formula of the waterjet thruster according to the thrust envelope the control system and the thrust distribution of the waterjet propulsors when it is applied to the dynamically positioned ship are briefly discussed but they had not discussed further about the construction of waterjet thrust model hu et al 2011 researched translational maneuvering method of a dual waterjet propelled craft and proposed a control method that adjusting the operating parameters with angle of the opposite direction but of the same magnitude by two handles the thrust model of waterjet in this paper is simpli fied and there is no process of control optimization which can make the result obtained faster but limits the range of the thrust envelope generated by waterjets jointly xiaoyin et al 2017 carried out the research of joystick vector control system for dual waterjet propelled crafts and established the mathematical model of the motion of double waterjet ship according the simulation of thrust distribution optimization was done by cascade generalized inverse thrust allocation algorithm and automatic offset method respectively however they only considering the thrust allocation without further analysis of the joint action between each component of waterjet yufan 2017 took the double waterjet ship as the object of study established a three degree of freedom motion control model based on the fuzzy pid control method and the ship maneuverability equation proposed by the japanese maneuverability motion mathematical model seminar group mmg he supposed that compared with the conventional pid control method this method has the advantages of faster response speed and stronger anti interference ability zuti et al 2018 studied the thrust vector control system of high pressure sub waterjet propulsion but the structure of high pressure sub waterjet is quite distinct from conventional waterjet propulsion the methodology adopted by the authors for developing vector control system of ship maneuvering under low speed conditions and the results of vector control tests on scale model are presented in this article through the vector control model established in this paper the crew driver can complete the vector control of ship maneuvering by only controlling a joystick which simplifies the difficulty of operation and increases the accuracy of manipulation in the actual maneuvering process the crew driver first controls the joystick according to the motion of ship and then the three operation parameters of the joystick are assigned through computer analysis and calculation the six parameters of the port and starboard propulsion devices are obtained then by means of the combination of the six control variables the expected movement of the hull can be achieved by controlling its three parameters 2 technical scheme of developing vector control system 2 1 control mode of vector control vector control function is primarily used for ship maneuvering under low speed conditions such as ship berthing where the parameters of vessel attitude and surrounding environment change rapidly if vector control system was based on full automatic control mode it would rely on a large number of sensor and largely demands on quick response high accuracy and reliability of the control system however the high development cost and unfavorable product price may limit its wide application in waterjet propelled ships in addition if ships were completely handed over to the full automatic control system there may be also potential safety risks in the operation of complex ship motions such as docks in rough conditions and environments in this article the closed loop control mode is adopted to develop vector control system as shown in fig 1 where the crew driver is involved in the control with highly developed sensory functions and intelligence of human beings drivers can give effective ship maneuvering response in time according to the targets on motion direction motion velocity and heading angle of the vessel in the actual working process three target parameters of hull motion are determined by the crew driver according to the expected motion of the ship based on the motion of the joystick three manipulation parameters are input to the computer for analysis and calculation with vector control algorithm the calculated six operating parameters of propulsors are output to six actuators of two sets of waterjets respectively to control the hull motion because of the disturbance of wind wave and current the actual motion parameters of the hull and the target parameters of the hull may not be consistent frequently when the ship deviates from its desired trajectory due to external disturbances the crew driver can observe the yaw situation and the direction of ship motion to modify the operation action so that the hull can achieve the desired motion and realize the vector control function 2 2 thrust allocation strategy in ship maneuvering the required ship motions are achieved by controlling thrust magnitude and thrust direction of two waterjets the thrust allocation strategy of two thrusters has a significant influence on ship motion in low speed conditions the range of roll heave and pitch motion of the hull is small which has little influence on waterjet thrust and thus can be neglected various kinds of ship motions can be treated as a combination of translational motion and yaw motion the thrust allocation analysis is carried out mainly for such two basic motions the thrust allocation strategy discussed in this section draws on the translation maneuvering method established in hu desheng s paper 2011 and carries out the hull force analysis under each typical motion condition according to the train of thought and understanding in this paper 2 2 1 maneuvering strategy of translational motion translational motion includes lateral motion and oblique motion lateral motion is very useful at low speed conditions such as berthing unberthing entering and leaving the port in order to improve the lateral motion and make its manipulation process easier to understand the control of two waterjets are based on synchronous thrust adjustment with mirror symmetric thrust direction taking right lateral motion as example the starboard waterjet works in reverse condition producing reversing force t 2 with an deflection angle ϕ to the right as shown in fig 2 a while the port waterjet works in forward condition producing forward thrust t 1 with an deflection angle ϕ to the left the magnitude of reverse thrust t 2 is equal to the forward thrust t 1 and the direction of t 2 is mirror symmetric with that of t 1 taking the hull cross section at the rotation centre as the benchmark the symbol of ϕ shown in fig 2 a is the intersection angle between thrust and axial line of ship while the symbol of φ is the intersection angle between the installation position of waterjet and the axis of hull when the combined thrust of two waterjets acts on the mass centre of ship ϕ and φ are equal forward thrust t 1 and reversing thrust t 2 form a resultant force t which pushing the hull to move right lateral when the intersection point of resultant force with mid ship line and the rotation centre of hull rotate are overlapped the speed of lateral motion can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing t 1 and t 2 in the same ratio while the waterjet nozzle direction remains unchanged and only two waterjet pump speed should be changed at the same time as to left sideways motion similar strategy is adopted in such case the port waterjet operates on reverse condition while the starboard waterjet works on forward condition on the basis of lateral motion oblique motion of ship in various directions can be achieved by turning the ratio of t 1 to t 2 for example on the basis of right lateral motion shown in fig 2 a the ship will move front right by increasing rotational speed and corresponding forward thrust of port waterjet and keeping the rotational speed of starboard waterjet unchanged while the thrust direction of two waterjets both remain same and their resultant thrust t turns to front right the direction angle α between the resultant force t and midship line can be adjusted by changing the ratio of t 1 to t 2 as shown in fig 2 b 2 2 2 maneuvering strategy of heading control in the environment of wind wave and current the heading adjustment is required to keep the translational motion of hull steady taking the right lateral motion for example the heading of hull can be controlled by means of the method illustrated in fig 3 if the bow of hull deflects clockwise the heading can be adjusted by increasing synchronously the direction angle ϕ of forward thrust t 1 and reverse thrust t 2 at same level the resultant thrust t still facing to right moves δ l towards astern which generate a counter clockwise yaw moment m l equal to t δ l about the rotational centre of hull as shown in fig 3 a analogously when the heading of hull deflects to the left decreasing synchronously the direction angle ϕ of forward thrust t 1 and reverse thrust t 2 at same level will result in a clockwise yaw moment m r equals to t δ l to correct the heading direction in such case the resultant thrust t moves δ l towards the bow as shown in fig 3 b furthermore on the basis of the above operation increasing the rotational speed of the waterjet pump on both sides simultaneously can increase the resultant force of the two waterjet thrusters thereby increasing the regulating yaw moment and vice versa this operation is shown in fig 3 c on the other hand when the steering nozzles of both sides of waterjet are maintained in the median position the reverse bucket of one side is retracted and the other side is put down the hull can rotate in situ as shown in fig 3 d 3 mathematical model of vector control crew driver manipulates the joystick to control the operating parameters of two waterjets according to the algorithm in computer and the waterjets control ship motion by adjusting their thrusts synchronously to establish the vector correspondence relationship between joystick operations and ship motions mathematical modeling of vector control is needed to build the relationship between manipulation parameters of joystick and operation parameters of two waterjets which provide the theory for computer programming the modeling includes two works one is to obtain the relationship between manipulating parameters of joystick and ship motions another one is to build the relationship between ship motions and waterjet operating parameters the vector control model is shown in fig 4 as for the first work to obtain the relationship between joystick and ship motions the following three requirements should be met firstly the phase angle of joystick and the motion direction angle α of required thrust t should be consistency secondly the inclination angle γ of joystick should be proportional to the ship thrust t which corresponds to the speed of the ship motion v s thirdly the rotation angle τ of joystick should be proportional to the yaw moment m that adjusts ship bow heading angle σ the maximum value of t is determined according to the cavitation limitation on rotational speed of reversing waterjet in mooring condition the maximum value of m is calculated regarding the range of t and the installation position of waterjet on craft the second work is critical to the model of vector control which contains two steps the first step is to calculate separately the thrust values and thrust directions of two waterjets according to the ship motion parameters where the thrust allocation strategy established in the section 2 2 needs to be applied the second step is to calculate the operating parameters of waterjets according to allocated thrust which is introduced in the following section 3 1 to section 3 2 3 1 calculation of operating parameters for single waterjet the thrust of waterjet is regulated horizontally by changing the injection angle of the steering nozzle of the waterjet in the horizontal direction while the reverse regulation of the thrust is realized by the retractable bucket thrust is equal to the rate of momentum change per unit time after the water passes through the waterjet propulsor the thrust can be obtained indirectly based on the momentum flow method raised by van terwisga 2005 in 24th ittc when the steering nozzle angle is zero according to the law of momentum the waterjet thrust t can be expressed as 1 t ρ q v j v i where q is the flow rate of the waterjet v j is the jet velocity at nozzle v i is the inflow velocity beneath the hull and ρ is the density of water fig 5 shows the inlet flow and jet flow of single waterjet the jet velocity of the outlet surface of waterjet nozzle can be calculated by the suction flow rate of the waterjet 2 v j q s n o z o u t where s n o z o u t is the area of nozzle outlet as vector control is used for maneuvering control of ships at low speed the inlet velocity of the waterjet v i in the formulas mentioned above can be approximated to zero to simplify the analysis thus the relationship between the waterjet thrust and the suction flow rate of the waterjet can be simplified as shown in eq 3 3 t ρ q 2 s n o z o u t the m type reverse bucket is widely used on small and medium size waterjets the fluid flow and related force are sketched in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the waterjet is in reverse condition θ is the nozzle steering angle while ξ is the angle between the outlet on one side of reverse bucket and the central axis of waterjet which is a constant value for a certain type waterjet t r is the reversing thrust produced by a single waterjet in axial direction which is composed by the reaction forces t r l and ω w r produced by the water on the two side of the reverse bucket if approximately assumed that the flow rate inside two branched passage of reverse bucket changes linearly with nozzle steering angle θ the flow rate at the left outlet of the reverse bucket q r l can be calculated according to eq 4 4 q r l 1 2 q 1 θ θ max where θ max is the maximum steering angle of the nozzle and θ θ max θ max the flow rate at the right outlet of the reverse bucket q r r can be obtained in the similar way based on the function relationship between flow rate and waterjet thrust established by eq 3 t r l can be obtained by eq 5 and the thrust t r r can be obtained in the similar way 5 t r l ρ q r l 2 s r o u t s n o z o u t v j θ max θ 2 θ max 2 ρ s r o u t η cos β where η is the energy utilization efficiency in order to consider the flow loss of water passing through nozzles reverse buckets and other components of waterjet s r o u t is cross sectional area of the one side outlet of reverse bucket moreover β is the angle between the horizontal plane and the forward jet flow of water in the reverse bucket which is also a constant value for a certain type waterjet according to the structural characteristics of reverse bucket and steering nozzle in fig 6 the force analysis is carried out based on triangle geometry theorem eq 6 and eq 7 can be obtained 6 t r l t r r sin ξ ϕ sin ξ ϕ 7 t r t r l 2 t r r 2 2 t r l t r r cos π 2 ξ ρ s n o z o u t 2 v j 2 4 θ max 2 s r o u t η cos β θ max θ 4 θ max θ 4 2 θ max θ 2 θ max θ 2 cos 2 ξ where t r is the reversing force of single waterjet resultant force hence combining eq 5 eq 6 and eq 7 eq 8 can be obtained 8 sin ξ ϕ sin ξ ϕ θ max θ θ max θ 2 thus the equation for calculating the steering angle of waterjet nozzle can be obtained by transformation as shown in eq 9 9 θ θ max 2 θ max 1 sin ξ φ sin ξ φ according to engineering experience the flow rate of waterjet is approximately linear with the rotating speed of waterjet pump which is shown as eq 10 this hypothesis is considered reasonable by subsequent numerical simulations of the hydrodynamics of waterjet ships 10 q k n where k is a constant coefficient and n is the rotating speed of waterjet pump based on the above conclusions the equation for calculating the rotating speed of the waterjet pump in reversing condition can be deduced as shown in eq 11 11 n r 1 k 4 s r o u t θ max 2 t r ρ η 1 cos β θ max θ 4 θ max θ 4 2 θ max θ 2 θ max θ 2 cos 2 ξ 1 2 where η 1 is the energy utilization efficiency when the waterjet is in the reverse operating condition on the other hand when the reverse bucket is retracted the waterjet thrust and the rotating speed in the ahead state can also be calculated by the same method the steering angle θ a and rotational speed n a of waterjet in forward condition can be determined by eq 12 and eq 13 12 θ a ϕ 13 n a 1 k t a s n o z o u t ρ η 2 1 2 where t a is the forward thrust produced by a single waterjet in axial direction and η 2 is the energy utilization efficiency when the waterjet is in the ahead operating condition 3 2 thrust allocation of two waterjets for desired ship motions the direction velocity and heading angle of ship motion correspond respectively to the direction angle α magnitude t and corresponding rotation moment m of the resultant thrust of two waterjets a control strategy based on synchronous thrust adjustment of two waterjets with equal angle magnitude as introduced in chapter 2 is selected to allocate the thrusts to meet the thrust requirement for desired ship motions as illustrated in fig 2 the force direction angle ϕ of two waterjets in ahead and reversing operation conditions can be determined according to eq 14 14 ϕ arctan y x m t sin α where as shown in fig 2 ϕ is the intersection angle between thrust and axial line of ship x is the longitudinal distance between rotation centre of ship and the transom plate y is the transversal distance between waterjet installation position and the mid ship line α is the angle between the resultant thrust direction of two waterjets and the mid ship line for example when the ship moves towards right as shown in fig 2 a the left waterjet is in ahead state whose reverse bucket needs to pull up and the right one is in reverse state whose bucket drops down the operation parameters of left waterjet and right waterjet can be calculated by the following formulas 15 left waterjet t w l t a v w l v a n w l n a θ w l θ a 16 right waterjet t w r t r v w r v r n w r n r θ w r θ r where subscript wl denotes the parameters of left waterjet while wr means the parameters of right waterjet according to the sine theorem of force the following formulas can be obtained 17 sin α ϕ 90 t w r sin 270 ϕ α t w l sin 2 ϕ t the following equations can be obtained by conversion of the above formulas 18 t w l t a t sin α ϕ sin 2 ϕ t w r t r t sin α ϕ sin 2 ϕ for a particular ship motion the ahead force t a reversing force t r and their directional angle of two waterjets can be calculated by eq 18 firstly then their respective operating parameters can be obtained by eq 9 eq 11 eq 12 and eq 13 especially when the hull moves in translation there are the following special conditions 19 t w l t w r α 9 0 4 numerical analysis of waterjet thrust in the establishment of the mathematical model of vector control mentioned above some assumptions are adopted such as the linear relationship between the flow rate of waterjet and the rotational speed of waterjet pump which needs to be verified by test or numerical simulation on the other hand there are friction loss and vortex loss in the waterjet which can not be neglected in order to achieve better results of vector control the energy loss coefficient in the mathematical model needs to be calculated reasonably furthermore in order to verify the relevant assumptions in the mathematical model and accurately calculate the energy loss coefficient to ensure the validity of calculation results of the mathematical model numerical simulation of thrust performance of waterjet under ship self propelled condition is carried out by using the cfd computational fluid dynamics solver star ccm in this paper based on the numerical results and analysis the corresponding relationship between thrust vector of single waterjet mass flow of waterjet and pump rotational speed under different working conditions is established and the energy loss coefficients are obtained by interpolating these data the relationship curves between forward thrust reverse thrust and pump rotational speed of waterjet flow rate are drawn under different pump speeds a model of a mono hull craft equipped with two waterjets is used for the numerical simulation and analysis the model craft is 3 80 m and the displacement is 420 kg as the vector control function is mainly used in low speed maneuvering conditions of ships the speed of the craft is

viscosity coefficient ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress considering the symmetry of the ship which is equipped with two waterjets only half domain of the flow field on the side of the symmetric plane is adopted fig 8 shows the flow field domain and its boundary conditions the s s t k ω turbulence model with wall functions is applied and governing equations are discreted with second order upwind scheme to reduce the transaction errors the volume of fluid vof method and hric format is used to trace the free surface the motion of the hull is calculate based on the method of overset mesh the overset domain which activate the motion function of sinkage and trim include the hulls and the surrounding rectangular domain the length of overset domain is 1 4 times of the hull length while the width is 1 time of the hull beam the rotor of waterjet uses a relative rotation coordinate system mrf to simulate the rotation and injection of the propulsor in this paper the validation of cfd simulations has been carried out on 5 various mesh schemes which takes the condition when nozzle steering angle is 0 and the reverse bucket is retracted as the example table 1 shows the numerical simulation results of different mesh schemes the simulation time steps of all mesh schemes are reduced until the hydrodynamic results no longer change according to the results shown in table 1 the numerical simulations of different conditions adopt no 3 mesh scheme unstructured grids are used to construct the hull surface and its surrounding domain the boundary layer on the wall of the hull and the waterjet duct is simulated with a 10 layers prism grid to keep the value of y in the range of 30 100 the free surface the stern wave and the inlet of the waterjet are all grid densified as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 the rotor and stator of the waterjet are constructed by structural grid through the software turbogrid the surface grid of waterjet rotor and stator is shown in fig 11 fig 12 a shows the jet flow and the waterjet inlet flow of the self propelled craft when the reverse bucket is retracted and the steering nozzle rotates 10 while the reverse bucket is put down and the steering nozzle rotates 15 in fig 12 b as shown in fig 12 b part of the jet flow of the reverse bucket hits the hull stern the calculated operating conditions and their results are shown in fig 13 to fig 16 as shown in the fig 13 of the relationship between suction flow rate of waterjet and rotational speed of waterjet pump the functional relationship between them can be obtained approximately as shown in eq 23 aiming at the waterjet in this paper 23 q 0 009 n 0 008 0 009 n therefore the relationship between the rotational speed of the waterjet pump and the flow rate of the waterjet can be approximated as a linear relationship combined with the relationship between the mass flow and thrust of waterjet shown in fig 14 the mathematical relationship between pump speed and thrust of waterjet can be established it should be noted that the thrust of waterjet mentioned here is the thrust produced by the waterjet pump when it is not affected by the steering nozzle and the reversing bucket which is the ideal thrust mentioned later at a given pump speed moreover as shown in the fig 15 and fig 16 the variation of energy utilization efficiency η under different working conditions can be obtained vector control function is mainly used in low speed conditions and the range of pump speed change is not large during the control process hence the difference of energy utilization efficiency η at different rotating speeds can be ignored approximately functional relationship between energy utilization efficiency η and nozzle steering angle is established approximately as shown in eq 24 24 η 1 9 10 7 θ 4 7 10 5 θ 3 0 0016 θ 2 0 0012 θ 0 9829 η 2 2 10 6 θ 4 0 0001 θ 3 0 0023 θ 2 0 0071 θ 0 6632 where η 1 is the energy utilization efficiency when the waterjet is in the reverse operating condition while η 2 is the energy utilization efficiency when the waterjet is in the ahead operating condition the above cfd numerical analysis shows the rationality of the relevant assumptions in this paper and approximates the expression of energy loss coefficients under different working conditions thus improving the calculation accuracy of the mathematical model of vector control 5 model test of vector control system in order to verify the results of vector control tests of three conditions and ship maneuvers are performed to validate the vector control model a prototype with above mentioned vector control model is manufactured and is equipped on a waterjet craft as shown in fig 17 the vector control system is developed based on the industrial personal computer idc data acquisition card and data output card the algorithm for vector control is coded using labview language the single joystick set on the operation platform is used to control the ship maneuvering motion two sets of waterjet propulsion system are designed with cad software and are manufactured by 3d printer the system is powered by motor and its operation speed is adjusted by voltage control the pneumatic system is employed for retracting and putting down the reverse bucket the steering angle is controlled by stepper motor 5 1 composition of control system as shown in fig 18 the vector control system consists of a data acquisition card pci 3361 an industrial computer a data output card pci 3304 and other mechanical execution parts the data acquisition board has the functions of analog input analog output digital input and serial communication the joystick sends the latest position information which includes the position of the x and y axes the angle of the z axis to the industrial computer through the serial port all vector control command including ship motion direction angle α and speed of ship motion v s ship bow heading angle σ can be transformed from the position of the x y axes and the angle of the z axis of the joystick 5 2 translational motion test the tests for translational motion include two types of ship motion namely lateral motion and oblique motion each type of test is repeated three times in the test of lateral motion the crew turns the joystick to the left side and correspondingly the ship moves laterally toward its left direction at the same time the ship heading is adjusted by tuning the heading adjust button on the joystick the snapshots of the ship s lateral motions are shown in fig 19 the moving distances of the ship in the three tests are 9 m the longitudinal position deviation between the tested and expected berthing locations is 0 418 m which is approximately 0 11 times of ship length the effect of control of ship lateral motion is satisfactory in the test of oblique motion the crew turns the joystick to the right front side and correspondingly the ship moves toward its right front direction the snapshots of the ship s oblique motions are shown in fig 20 the errors of ship heading angle during the voyage are less than six degrees the angle deviation between the actual motion track of test and the desired motion tracks is less than 2 1 the results show that the proposed vector control system is effective for the ship oblique motion 5 3 test for motion combining translation and rotation as mentioned previously the control strategy for propulsive force direction is based on adjusting synchronously the steering angles of two propulsion systems mirror equiangularily with this strategy the ship s complex maneuvering which combines translation and rotation such as rectangular tracing motion and fan shaped tracing motion is performed by turning the joystick and tuning the heading control button fig 21 shows the snapshots of the ship moving around a rectangular object in the three repeated tests the deviation of radial distance between the tested navigation track and the expected semicircular track is less than 0 5 m 5 4 vector control test in wave to test the performance of vector control for ship motion in waves model tests of ship moving laterally in regular beam sea are conducted in the towing tank during the tests the vector control system performs well fig 22 show the snapshots of the ship s lateral motions in the case of wave height of 7 cm whose corresponding value is 0 7 m regarding a ship with length of 38 m and is typical in the harbor area 6 conclusion and prospect 1 a mathematical model of vector control for waterjet ship maneuvering with single joystick in low speed operating conditions is developed based on closed loop control mode and thrust allocation strategy of synchronous thrust adjusting with mirror equiangular direction angles some complex maneuvering tests such as transverse motion of hull are conducted both in calm water and in wave the proposed vector control function is performed well in these tests the main findings in this research results can be used as technical references for developing vector control system of waterjet propelled vessels 2 the calculated results of waterjet operation parameters are influenced in the vector control mathematical model by some factors such as the distribution characteristics of flow with steering angle and the energy conversion efficiency in the bucket the hydrodynamic data and loss coefficients of ship and waterjet can be obtained approximately by cfd simulation and local correction is still needed in actual operation according to the ship model test results of transversal motion and rotational motion 3 the vector control mathematical model is set up for the m shape bucket where jet flow is split into two parts such model is suitable to most medium and small size waterjets for waterjets with other type bucket the principle of vector control theory still works however the formula for calculating waterjet operating parameters needs to be modified according to the specific structure of the waterjet credit authorship contribution statement jiabing jiang conceptualization software methodology validation formal analysis investigation data curation writing

21824,floating structures have become the most feasible solution for supporting wind turbines when offshore wind project move to deeper water in this paper a hydrodynamic analysis of three different semisubmersible floating offshore wind turbines is carried out including second order hydrodynamic effects the three examined platforms are v shaped semisubmersible braceless semisubmersible and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible and are used to support the nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine the main objective of the present study is to investigate and compare the hydrodynamic response of the three different semisubmersible floaters in two water depths 100 m and 200 m under different load conditions the effects of second order wave loads on the platform motions and mooring tension are discussed and compared by using different methods including newman s approximation and the full qtf quadratic transfer function method the drag effect on the structure motion response is also discussed in this paper the comparison presented is based on statistical values and response spectra of floating platform motions as well as mooring tensions the results show that the dynamic response of semisubmersible fowts floating offshore wind turbines is overestimated when ignoring the morison drag effect on the columns of the semisubmersible fowt the second order difference wave loads can excite the resonance of motion especially for the platform pitch motion which could cause structural failures the full qtf method should be used to calculate the second order wave force to better simulate the realistic dynamic response of semisubmersible fowts keywords hydrodynamic loads second order wave loads semisubmersible floating wind turbines newman s approximation quadratic transfer function 1 introduction wind energy has experienced rapid development in recent years moving from onshore to offshore at the end of 2018 18 499 mw of installed wind turbine power capacity from a total of 4543 offshore wind turbines was installed decastro et al 2019 most offshore wind turbines are installed in shallow water with bottom fixed foundations shi et al 2015 2016 mo et al 2017 chian et al 2018 in many countries including china norway and the usa the main portion of offshore wind resources is found in deep water where the bottom fixed supporting structures are not economically feasible floating offshore wind turbines fowts provide a promising solution in deep water areas in china the offshore resources in shallow water are estimated to be 750 gw at 10 m height while the offshore resources in deep water are estimated to be 1740 gw hong and möller 2011 to explore the wind energy in deep water sites many concepts have been proposed for fowts by utilizing technology and experience from the offshore oil and gas industry based on the principles adopted to achieve static stability floating support platforms can be classified into three primary concepts semisubmersible spar buoy and tension leg platform tlp some designs are in the prototype stage including the full scale projects hywind demo driscoll et al 2016 in norway windfloat maciel 2010 in portugal fukushima phase ii fowt boccard 2014 in japan and hywind scotland skaare 2017 in the uk etc compared to spar buoy and tlp the semisubmersible platform is more feasible in various water depths and has low installation costs of the mooring system the semisubmersible platform has better hydrodynamic behaviour due to the deep draft several concepts of semisubmersible floating offshore wind turbines have been proposed including windfloat roddier et al 2010 dutch tri floater huijs et al 2014 windsea lefranc and torud 2011 windflo le boulluec et al 2013 braceless luan et al 2016 v shaped karimirad and michailides 2015 oc4 deepcwind robertson et al 2014 semisubmersible fowts currently several numerical simulations of fowts antonutti et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 shi et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 have been carried out to investigaite the dynamic performance of semisubmersible fowts using first order radiation and diffraction however the offshore oil and gas industry has demonstrated the importance of second order hydrodynamic load for certain floating platform the second order wave loads mainly include mean drift force sum and difference frequency wave loads the sum frequency and difference frequency loads can excite offshore structures eigenfrequencies and may result in large oscillations that cause damage to the floating structures roald et al 2013 assessed the importance of second order wave forces on oc3 hywind spar and the umaine tlp the results show that the second order wave forces are very small for oc3 hywind while those are quite high on umaine tlp coulling et al 2013 used newman s approximation method in fast to consider the effect of second order wave force on oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt the results show that the second order difference frequency wave diffraction forcing played a significant role in the global response of the deepcwind semi submersible fowt li et al 2017 proposed a new concept of fowt and investigated the hydrodynamic response of the floating platform with an emphasis on the computation of second order difference frequency wave loads and their effects on the global rigid body motion response xu et al 2018 assessed the importance of second order hydrodynamics on the braceless semisubmersible floating offshore wind turbine concept using newman s approximation and the full qtf method gueydon et al 2014 used different codes including fast and anysim to investigate the second order effect on oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt the results show that the second order sum frequency loads appeared to have negligible effects on the motions while the effects of difference frequency load were larger the loads and responses of the system caused by the second order hydrodynamics were analyzed and compared to the first order hydrodynamic loads and induced motions in the frequency domain by bayati et al 2014 in this paper the main objective is to investigate hydrodynamic effects on the response of three different semisubmersible floating offshore wind turbines including the v shaped semisubmersible fowt the braceless semisubmersible fowt and the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt at different water depths addressing second order hydrodynamic loads hydrodynamic models are developed by using the ansys aqwa tool with the panel method ansys inc 2017 particular attention is given to second order hydrodynamics loadings using newman s approximation and the full qtf method the second order hydrodynamic loads and resulted responses are analyzed and compared with relevant loads responses and induced motions in the frequency domain for different water depths the effect of the second order hydrodynamic loads and water depth is examined for all three semisubmersible platforms in moderate water depths 40 m 100 m dynamic responses of semisubmersible fowt become larger than those in deep water for the responses of the three semisubmersible fowts at different water depth the results show that the braceless semisubmersible fowt is more sensitive in shallow water depth for the first order solution morison drag term has a significant impact on the platform motion showing that morison drag term should also be considered for better simulating the actual motion responses furthermore it is found that the heave natural frequency of oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is close to the normal wave frequency range which could cause large resonance and then cause the failure of the structure for second order solution motion responses can be excited when considering second order wave loads the results show that the pitch motion can be greatly excited when using the full qtf method compared to the pitch motion responses of three semisubmersible fowts at different water depth the contribution of second order wave loads to the pitch motion increasing when the water depth decreases therefore the full qtf method should be used in the numerical simulation of semisubmersible fowts to better capture the effect of second order wave loads the results presented in this paper may help resolve the fundamental design trade offs between different fowts 2 theoretical background it is important to design floating offshore wind turbines considering fluid structure interaction the force on the floating structures and motion of the platform caused by these interactions is one of the main subjects of marine hydrodynamics the hydrodynamics are mainly divided into two parts the influence of fluid motions on the structures diffraction and the influence of moving structures that lead to the wave generation radiation hydrostatics should also be accounted for to consider the effects of buoyancy and hydrostatic restoring forces the hydrodynamic loads can be estimated by using the morison equation potential flow theory hybrid methods or higher fidelity numerical modelling techniques e g computational fluid dynamics cfd the morison equation is mainly used to calculate the hydrodynamic loads for slender structures with small diameters compared with the wavelength for large volume structures diffraction and radiation are relatively important and potential flow theory is used to calculate the hydrodynamic loads acting on the platform 2 1 potential flow theory the potential flow theory faltinsen 1993 teng 2015 is used to calculate the hydrodynamics when designing marine structures potential flow theory considers the flow around a body to be incompressible inviscid and irrotational with negligible surface tension effects the hydrodynamic loads that usually affect the response of floating wind turbines consist of two parts first order wave loads and second order wave loads 2 1 1 first order wave loads for the first order wave calculations the load on the structure and platform motion have zero mean value and oscillate with the frequency of the incident wave faltinsen 1993 first order hydrodynamic wave load including incident wave loads diffraction wave loads and radiation wave loads can be described by 1 f f i f d f r 2 f i f d s i ω ρ w φ i n j d s s i ω ρ w φ d n j d s 3 f r x k ρ w ω s φ ik re n j d s x k ρ w s φ i k im n j d s a jk x k b jk x k where f i is the incident wave load f d is the diffraction wave load f r is the radiation wave load ω is the circular frequency of the wave n is the normal direction vector of the wet surface s is the area of the wet surface immersed in water φ i is the incident potential of the wave without the perturbation of the body φ d is the diffraction potential of the wave when the waves pass through the body ρ w is the density of the water n j is a direction vector φ i k re and φ i k im are the real and imaginary parts of the incident potential of the wave without the perturbation of the body respectively a jk and b jk are the added mass and radiation damping coefficients the indices k and j refer to the degrees of freedom dofs of the platform 2 1 2 second order wave loads second order hydrodynamic loads are proportional to the square of the wave amplitude and have frequencies that are equal to both the sum and the difference of pairs of incident wave frequencies this means that although the natural frequencies of the structure are designed to be outside the first order wave energy spectrum the second order loads may excite these frequencies therefore despite the normally small second order hydrodynamic loads the resonant effect may be significant second order wave exciting forces can be described in the frequency domain by decomposition into three terms newman 1967 fonseca et al 2008 pessoa et al 2010 1 mean drift force f m e a n 2 which is a frequency dependent mean value 2 difference frequency wave drift force f d i f f 2 which oscillates at difference wave frequencies 3 sum frequency wave force f s u m 2 which oscillates at sum wave frequencies according to pinkster 1975 the second order wave forces can be written as the summation of five different components when they are determined by direct pressure integration 4 f 2 w l 1 2 ρ g ξ r 1 ξ r 1 n d l i s 0 1 2 ρ φ 1 2 n d s ii s 0 ρ x φ 1 t n d s iii m s r x g iv s 0 ρ φ 2 t n d s v where ρ is the density of the water g is the gravitational acceleration n is the direction of the normal φ 1 is the first order velocity potential w l is the waterline ξ r 1 is the relative wave elevation s 0 is the mean wetted surface of the floating body x is the motion of the floating body m s is mass of the floating body m s is the mass matrix of floating structure r is the rotational transformation matrix of floating structure x g is the acceleration of the center of gravity φ 2 is the second order velocity potential components i to iv represent the mean drift force which is determined from the first order solution the mean drift force can be calculated by using the far field method or near field method the accuracy of the far field method is higher than that of the near field method but it can calculate the force in only three dofs by contrast near field solution can be used to calculate second order wave forces on a floating body in 6 dofs therefore the near field method is employed in the present paper to calculate the mean drift force based on the mean wetted body surface integration approach with regards to the semisubmersible floating offshore platform the slow drift wave force term 5 including the difference frequency force becomes more significant the difference frequency is close to the natural frequency of the semisubmersible platform which could cause the resonance of the floating system and could damage the structure the fifth component of equation 4 involves the second order velocity potential that can be calculated directly by using the near field solution the full qtf method compared to newman s approximation method the complete qtf matrix gives more accurate estimations of the low frequency loads however it requires the solution to the second order problem and the time series reconstruction is more time demanding therefore newman s approximation method is proposed mainly to avoid computing the second order velocity potential φ 2 and to improve computational efficiency for newman s approximation the drift force can be described by 5 p i j 0 5 a i a j p i i a i 2 p j j a j 2 6 q i j 0 where p i i p j j q i i and q j j are calculated from second order mean drift force solution therefore quadratic transfer functions qtf including p i j q i j can be calculated for semisubmersible floating platforms the most significant part of the dynamic response is at both the wave frequency and the structure natural frequency region therefore only the mean drift force and slowly varying drift force will be discussed since the difference frequency value is close to the natural frequency of the semisubmersible floating platform 2 2 viscous load in the potential flow theory the viscous effect from the flow is ignored in order to take into account the viscous force the drag term of the morison equation is used the viscous drag term of the morison equation for the fluid force acting on the cross section of a slender structural member is 7 d f v i c o u s 0 5 ρ c d a u f u s u f u s d l where c d is the drag coefficient a is the projected area of a unit length cylinder perpendicular to the flow direction u f is the fluid particle velocity u s is the structure s velocity 2 3 mooring system in this paper the lumped mass method hall and goupee 2015 is adopted to discretize the cable dynamics over the length of the mooring line in this approach as seen in fig 1 the mooring line is discretized into n evenly sized line segments connecting n 1 node points the right handed inertial reference frame is defined with the z axis being measured positive up from the water plane the location of each node point i is defined by the vector p i which contains the node position in x y and z direction each segment s i of a cable element has identical properties of unstreched length l diameter d density ρ young s modulus e and damping coeifficent c int and the cable model combines internal axial stiffness and damping forces with weight and buoyancy forces hydrodynamic forces from morison equation and forces from contact with the seabed 2 4 equation of motion the semisubmersible floating structure is represented by a six degree of freedom 6 dof rigid body the load model for the body accounts for the wave loads it is stated that in the present paper the emphasis is on the study of the hydrodynamic loads the equation of motion under wave loads in time domain is calculated in ansys aqwa for the rigid body motions j and it can be expressed as 8 i 1 6 m i j a i j x j t t x j τ k i j t τ d τ c i j x t f w a v

force that results from mooring lines j is the dof in surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw direction 3 numerical model of the semisubmersible fowts 3 1 wind turbine model different from the traditional marine floating structures the large height of the wind turbine could cause instability of the floater although the wind effect is not included in the present paper which means the wind turbine is in a parked condition the weight of wind turbines components is considered during the simulation the wind turbine used in this paper was developed by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel usa it is a conventional three bladed upwind variable speed collective pitch controlled horizontal axis wind turbine the geometric properties of the wind turbine and tower are listed in table 1 jonkman et al 2009 3 2 semisubmersible floating platform model three different semisubmersible floating platforms including 1 the v shaped semisubmersible floating platform 2 the braceless semisubmersible floating platform and 3 the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible floating platform were considered to support the nrel 5 mw wind turbine at two different water depths the water depth is assumed to be 100 m and 200 m for each concept the three floating structures are illustrated in fig 2 and their properties are summarized in table 2 the v shaped semisubmersible fowt is designed by karimirad and michailides 2015 according to the concept of semisubmersible fowt in project fukushima forward forward 2014 it consists of one main column and two side columns connected by two pontoons different from the other two semisubmersible platforms v shaped semisubmersible fowt is not a symmetrical floating platform which the nrel 5 mw wind turbine is at the top of the main column it must be noted that v shaped semi fowt maintains the balance by setting different ballast heights for each column more detailed properties of the v shaped semisubmersible fowt are summarized in karimirad and michailides 2015 2016 the braceless semisubmersible fowt is designed by luan et al 2016 in norwegian university of science and technology ntnu according to the concept of oo star semisubmersible fowt borisade 2016 it is mainly composed of three side columns and one central column it is noted that the braceless semisubmersible fowt is symmetrical with nrel 5 mw wind turbine on the centre column three pontoons are used to connect central column and side columns more detailed information of braceless semisubmersible fowt can be found in luan 2018 the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is designed by nrel the oc4 deepcwind semisubmer sible fowt consists of one central column and three side columns it has heave plates at the bottom of the upper columns to reduce the heave motion of the floating system several braces including horizontal and diagonal braces are used to connect the columns detailed properties of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt are available in robertson et al 2014 the main reason we chose the aforementioned three semisubmersible fowts is that the three semisubmersible fowt represents different design ideas for semisubmersible fowts the v shaped semisubmersible fowt is an asymmetric structure without the bracings and both braceless semisubmersible fowt and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is symmetric structures with center column supporting the wind turbine systems different from oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt barceless semisubmersible fowt has no bracings to connect the center column and side columns those three semisubmersible fowts are different in preliminary design 3 3 mooring systems designs for 200 m and 100 m for the v shaped semisubmersible fowt the mooring system consists of three catenary mooring lines that are made of wire rope fig 3 a the mooring line is positioned with 150 between the main mooring line ml 1 and the side mooring lines ml 2 ml 3 while the angle between ml 2 and ml 3 is 60 the clump mass of the v shaped semisubmersible fowt is positioned at 82 m far from the fairlead of each mooring line for both 100 m and 200 m the relevant characteristics of the mooring line are shown in tables 3 and 4 the mooring system of braceless semisubmersible fowt fig 3 b consists of three catenary mooring lines that are positioned with 120 between the mooring lines each mooring line is attached at the outer columns of the semisubmersible fowt at a water depth of 18 m the clump masses of the braceless semisubmersible for 100 m water depth are heavier than those for 200 m water depth which is designed to maintain the similar pretension and stiffness in different water depths the initial oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is designed for 200 m water depth which has been utilized as a reference model for the mooring system design of 100 m water depth fig 3 c based on the original 200 m water depth design a 100 m water depth mooring line is designed to achieve the similar stiffness jeon et al 2013 pretension and natural frequency of the floating system in surge motion the properties of the 100 m depth mooring line are kept the same as those of the 200 m water depth mooring lines a clump mass is also added at each line to achieve similar pretension and stiffness detailed mooring line properties and other characteristics of the mooring system are shown in tables 3 and 4 3 4 design load cases based on the data li et al 2015 norway site 5 fig 4 was selected as a representative site for the simulation it should be noted that wind loads are not considered in the present paper the main objective of this paper is to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of different semisubmersible fowt at different water depths with emphasis on the second order wave loads therefore only wave conditions are considered in the present paper three different wave conditions including moderate and extreme conditions are listed in table 5 3 5 numerical setting in the simulation the hydrodynamic loads are calculated using the boundary element method bem based on potential flow theory and the morison equation potential flow theory is applied on both the columns and pontoons and the drag term of the morison equation is applied to the columns for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt the bracings are modelled using the morison equation in this paper first order wave load analysis of the motion in sea states is performed with aqwa naut ansys inc 2017 which involves meshing the total wet surface of a structure to create a hydrodynamic and hydrostatic model the nonlinear froude krylov and hydrostatic wave forces on the instantaneous wetted surface i e beneath the incident wave surface can be calculated in naut this calculation is performed at each time step along with the instantaneous values of all other forces accurate dynamic or kinematic properties of fluid particles beneath the wave surface are thus required for this purpose these forces are then applied via a mathematical model see equation 10 the position and velocity at the subsequent time step are found by integrating these accelerations in the time domain using a two stage predictor corrector numerical integration scheme for the second order hydrodynamic model the mean drift force can be calculated by using the far field method or near field method in the aqwa drif module ansys inc 2017 in aqwa drif module the qtf can be calculated by using the direct pressure integration method pinkster 1975 newman s approximation is also used to calculate the second order wave force 3 5 1 panel model the panel model was developed in ansys software and the mapped mesh method is employed to obtain a finer frequency domain simulation result for the semisubmersible fowts in the aqwa line module the number of meshes used for the v shaped semisubmersible the braceless semisubmersible and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible models are 11 691 23 562 and 14 735 respectively the panel model of the three semisubmersible numerical models is shown in fig 5 3 5 2 viscous drag model to calculate the viscous drag of each column and pontoon on the semisubmersible fowt by the morison equation a beam model was used in ansys software cd depends upon the reynolds number kc number surface roughness and so on according to germanischer lloyd standard wind 2005 the cd can be set to 0 70 when the reynolds number is beyond 2 50e5 in the present simulation the drag coefficient is set to 0 68 to simulate the viscous drag term on the columns and pontoons it should be noted that the viscous force on the columns is applied along the transverse direction also the axial viscous drag force is not considered in the present paper the diameter of columns for the v shaped semisubmersible fig 5 a and the braceless semisubmersible fig 5 b fowts are 9 0 m and 6 5 m respectively for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt fig 5 c the diameters of the bracings central column upper column and base column is 1 6 m 6 5 m 12 0 m and 24 0 m respectively for the v shaped semisubmersible fowt and braceless semisubmersible fowt the equivalent diameter of pontoons is 7 6 m and 8 3 m respectively the diameter of the columns and pontoons was set to 0 01 m to ignore the inertia force from the morision equation futhermore the drag coefficient is scaled to take into account the modified geometry of the beam model and maintain the same viscous effect contribution as in the real physical model this is achieved by satisfying the following relation 11 c d d c d d where c d and d are the equivalent drag coefficient and the diameter of the column in the beam model respectively the values used in the computation are shown in table 6 4 result and discussion 4 1 response amplitude operator rao response amplitude operators raos can be computed based on the linear wave theory in aqwa the raos show considerable excitation only in the surge heave and pitch modes therefore only these raos are presented in fig 6 the excitation at the other natural frequencies sway roll and yaw is considerably less because of the zero degree wave heading for the surge motion fig 6 a the results show that the raos are similar for the three semisubmersible fowts however the raos are larger at a water depth of 100 m than at a water depth of 200 m for the heave motion fig 6 b two peaks are observed for the v shaped semisubmersible fowt showing the coupling effect between the heave and pitch motions a large peak is presented for the heave response at the heave natural frequency of the braceless semisubmersible fowt which is away from the incident wave frequency region 0 3 rad s to 0 8 rad s one peak is also found at the heave natural frequency of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt which is close to the wave frequency region this could cause a large heave motion response when the wave frequency is near the heave natural frequency of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt for the pitch motion fig 6 c there are two peaks observed in the low frequency region which are in the heave and pitch natural frequency region for the v shaped semisubmersible fowt and one peak is found at the pitch natural frequency for both the braceless and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowts notably the pitch motion response in the wave frequency region of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is larger than that of the other two platforms and it can also be observed that the heave and pitch motion responses for the three semisubmersible fowts are higher at moderate water depth 4 2 time domain analysis 4 2 1 motion response in this section the time domain dynamic motion responses of three platforms in different sea conditions with two water depths are estimated in order to focus on the most critical motion response only surge heave and pitch motion are displayed the total simulation time of the three semisubmersible fowt is 3500 s and the first 500 s have not been considered for either for drawing spectrum or statistical results to ignore the transient effect due to the limited space in this paper only the motion time domain response of the v shaped semisubmersible fowt under the lc 1 condition at a 200 m water depth is shown in fig 7 moreover the statistical results of the three semisubmersible fowts are discussed in this section the effect of the morison drag term and second order difference frequency wave force as well as water depth were the main focal point in figs 8 10 the maximum oscillation amplitude of the second order solution is plotted along with the first order results the following conclusions can be drawn from figs 8 10 for surge motion the responses of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt are larger than those of the other two platforms both at 100 m and 200 m water depths the results of the first order solutions show that maximum surge motion responses are larger than those considering the drag term effect for the v shaped semisubmersible and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowts for the second order solution the maximum surge motion responses are similar for the three semisubmersible fowts showing that newman s approximation solution considering the second order effect is enough for the surge dof for heave motion the maximum motion response of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is lower than those of the other two platforms under moderate sea conditions while it is larger than those of the other two platforms in extreme sea conditions as shown in fig 4 b the raos of heave motion for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is lower than those for the other two fowts when the frequency is greater than 0 5 rad s therefore under moderate sea conditions where the wave frequency is greater than 0 5 rad s the responses of heave motion are lower for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt than for the other two platforms however the wave peak period in the extreme sea state lc 3 is close to the heave natural period of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt which excites the heave motion response of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt for the first order solution the morison drag term has limited impact on the heave motion for the second order solution the second order wave force can greatly excite the heave motion response while the difference in maximum heave motion responses between the solution from newman s approximation solution and the full qtf solution is small for the pitch motion these figures also reveal that the second order wave force effects are important responses concering the first order results as seen in figs 8 c 9 c and 10 c the pitch responses of second order solutions are larger than those of first order solutions showing that the second order wave forces should be thoroughly considered especially under extreme sea condition lc 3 compared with newman s approximation method the full qtf method is more accurate for the calculation of second order wave forces as observed in the plots the pitch motion responses can be greatly excited when using the full qtf method especially for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt under extreme sea condition lc 3 the amplitude of pitch motion is around 10 while those are almost 18 for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt it also can be observed that the contribution of second order wave forces to the pitch motion increasing when the water depth decreases therefore full qtf method is needed for the calculation of second order wave forces to better capture the actual motion dynamic response for semisubmersible fowts for the moderate sea conditions there is a great similarity regarding the standard deviation std therefore only the std values from the lc 1 condition and lc 3 condition are listed tables 7 and 8 show the standard deviation std results of the three semisubmersible fowts under different water depths in the lc 1 and lc 3 condition the surge motion response shows that the std value of each semisubmersible fowt is larger when ignoring the morison drag term comparing the results from different second order solutions the maximum surge motion is similar for the three semisubmersible fowts these results indicate that together with the maximum values in surge motion the accuracy of the second order wave force can be ensured in surge motion by using newman s approximation method notably the morison drag force applied to each column is the transverse drag force therefore it has little impact on the heave motion response as shown in tables 7 and 8 as it is can be observed in table 7 to table 8 the std value of the heave motion response increased dramatically for the v shaped semisubmersible and braceless semisubmersible fowts when using the full qtf method for the pitch motion the std values of three semisubmersible platforms changes dramatically especially for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowts tables 7 and 8 also show that the std value of the motion response is larger at a moderate water depth than those at a water depth of 200 m showing that the motion response of semisubmersible fowts should be thoroughly considered at moderate water depths it is worth noting that the std value of pitch motion responses for the three semisubmersible fowt is much larger in full qtf solution under extreme condition lc 3 the std value of pitch motion for these three semisubmersible fowt at 200 m water depth is increased by 67 0 32 0 and 183 4 respectively when using the full qtf method as we can see under the extreme sea condition of the full qtf solution when water depth decreases the std of the pitch responses for the v shaped semisubmersible braceless semisubmersible and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is increased by 19 08 32 35 and 23 16 respectively showing that the braceless semisubmersible fowt is more sensitive to the change of water depth in general the platform motion responses are larger when considering the second order force using the full qtf method in other words the maximum and std values of the motion responses indicate the need to calculate the second order wave force accurately along with the first order loads to obtain the realistic combined effect of low frequency wave loading on the overall system dynamics which is underestimated without considering the second order terms 4 2 2 mooring tension response the maximum mooring line tensions for ml 1 and ml 2 are shown in fig 11 to fig 13 the standard deviation std values of the mooring tension for the three semisubmersible fowts under the lc 1 and lc 3 conditions are shown in table 9 and table 10 notably there is a constant offset in the negative surge direction before reaching the static equilibrium for the v shaped semisubmersible fowt while the braceless and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowts do not have such an offset therefore the pretension of ml 1 is larger than those of the other two mooring lines for the v shaped semisubmersible fowt the maximum values of the mooring line tension in extreme sea conditions where the significant wave height is large are relatively larger than those in moderate sea conditions for all semisubmersible fowts the mooring line tension performance of the oc4 deepcwind and v shaped semisubmersible fowt is similar at the two water depths while the mooring line tension is larger at a water depth of 200 m than at a water depth of 100 m for the braceless semisubmersible fowt as shown in figs 11 13 despite the small orders of magnitude for the drag force it could reduce the motion response and then affect the mooring tension responses as seen in the first order solution the maximum values and std values of the mooring line tension are larger when ignoring the morison drag force effect on the platform therefore the drag term of the column should be thoroughly considered to better capture the actual mooring response for the three semisubmersible fowt the second order wave force could lead to large responses at resonance moreover the second order wave force did increase the maximum values and standard deviation values as shown in figs 10 12 and tables 9 10 the maximum value as well as the std values of mooring force in a water depth of 100 m is larger when using the full qtf method therefore the effect of second order wave force on the mooring line tension should be thoroughly considered when designing semisubmersible fowt and mooring systems for moderate water depths from tables 7 10 the std results show that there is a good correlation between the mooring tension and surge motion comparing the std values for forces of ml 1 to those for ml 2 3 force reveals that ml 1 tension changed more dramatically than ml 2 and 3 tension for all semisubmersible fowts which means that ml 1 is more sensitive to external loads these results show that ml 1 is more susceptible to fatigue damage than other mooring lines and then causes the failure of the supporting platforms for the mooring system design of semisubmersible fowts especially for triangular platforms the main mooring line should be strengthened to maintain the safety of the supporting structures 4 3 spectral analysis this section presents the frequency domain analysis results of the three semisubmersible fowt with a 0 degree incoming wave direction under three load cases at two water depths four load models are listed together for comparison the motion and mooring tension responses with and without drag force on the column are compared for the second order solution the difference frequency wave loads using two methods newman s approximation and the full qtf method are obtained to investigate the second order wave force effect on the motion and mooring tension responses of semisubmersible fowts 4 3 1 natural frequencies of the three fowts the natural frequency of the surge heave and pitch motion for the three fowts are calculated by performing numerical decay tests in aqwa time series of free decay tests on surge heave and pitch motions can be obtained from aqwa output results then the natural frequency of the three fowts can be calculated based on the fast fourier transform fft method cooley et al 1969 as shown in table 11 4 3 2 hydrodynamic load spectrum a comparison between the drag force and first order wave force of the three semisubmersible fowts in the lc 1 condition at a 100 m water depth is shown in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 compared to the first order wave force the drag force is very small even though the drag force is small its resonant effect can be significant a comparison between the first order wave force and drag force in the frequency domain shows that the drag force is more broad banded than the first order force which could cause large resonance in the low frequency region especially for surge mode fig 15 shows a comparison of the second order wave force among the three semisubmersible fowts under moderate sea condition lc 1 by using newman s approximation and the full qtf method the results show that the power spectral density is mainly concentrated in the difference frequency region when using newman s approximation while two peaks appear in the difference frequency and sum frequency region when using the full qtf method although the natural frequencies of the structure are designed to be outside the first order wave energy spectrum the second order loads may excite these frequencies the difference frequency is close to the natural frequency of the structures for semisubmersible fowts as shown in fig 15 b second order responses in the difference frequency region are higher when using the full qtf method than when using to newman s approximation method of the v shaped semisubmersible and braceless semisubmersible fowt while the responses obtained using the two methods are similar for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt this set of data indicates that the second order force calculated by the full qtf method can greatly excite heave motion response for the v shaped semisubmersible and braceless semisubmersible fowts fig 15 c shows that in the difference frequency region the second order force responses computed using the full qtf method were higher than the responses computed using newman s approximation method for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt the result indicates that the pitch motion of oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible is more sensitive than that of the other two platforms when considering the second order wave force 4 3 3 motion spectrum for moderate sea conditions there is a great similarity regarding the power spectra density psd therefore only the spectrum results in the lc 1 condition are listed fig 16 to fig 18 show the motion spectrum of the three semisubmersible fowts in the lc 1 at two water depths 1 for surge motion the spectra of the motion responses consist of two parts the low frequency part is related to the surge natural frequency while the higher frequency part is dominated by the frequency from 0 4 to 0 8 rad s which is related to the wave peak frequency for the first order solution the surge resonance peak decreases significantly due to the drag force on each column compared to the first line as shown in fig 16 this is similar to what is observed for the other platforms fig 16 b and c comparing the values with and without the drag force reveals that dynamic response of surge motion can be greatly decreased by adding the morison drag force on the column therefore it is vitally significant to consider the drag term when designing and performing the computation of semisubmersible fowts newman s approximation method is suitable for surge resonant motion response while it doesn t apply to the heave or pitch resonant responses it can be seen from figs 16 and 17 that the heave and pitch resonant response in the low frequency region is underestimated therefore the full qtf method should be used for modelling the difference frequency wave force to better simulate the low frequency motion 4 3 4 mooring tension spectrum the mooring line responses in the frequency domain in the head for sea under the lc 1 condition of the three semisubmersible fowts are shown in figs 19 21 due to the symmetry of the mooring line configuration of the three platforms only the mooring line responses of ml 1 and ml 2 are displayed in this paper for the v shaped semisubmersible fowt the most significant contribution to the ml 1 tension comes from wave frequency range from 0 4 rad s to 0 8 rad s while for ml 2 and 3 the most significant contribution comes from the low frequency region surge motion response the contribution from the low frequency response increases with decreasing water depth a small peak is observed at approximately 0 25 rad s pitch natural frequency showing the coupling effect between surge and pitch modes the first order solution results show that the effect of drag force on the column becomes more significant as the water depth decreased it can also be seen that second order surge resonant responses fig 19 seem similar when using the two methods to perform the calculations of the difference frequency wave force at both water depths for the braceless semisubmersible fowt the mooring line tension responses consist of two parts the wave frequency range from 0 4 rad s to 0 8 rad s and the low frequency region including the surge pitch and heave mode response similar to the v shaped semisubmersible fowt the contribution from the low frequency response increases while the high frequency response wave frequency decreases for the second order solution the surge resonant responses are slightly higher when using the full qtf method than when using the newman s approximation to perform the difference frequency wave force calculation for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt in contrast to the other two platforms the most significant contribution to the mooring line tension comes from the low frequency region the coupling effect between structural modes including the surge and pitch modes is shown in fig 21 compared to the other two platforms the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fow show similar performance in the dynamic response of mooring line tension in the frequency domain at the two water depth similar to the braceless semisubmersible fowt surge resonant responses are slightly higher when using the full qtf method than when using newman s approximation method to calculate the difference frequency wave force 5 conclusions in this paper a comparative study of hydrodynamic performance among the v shaped semisubmersible braceless semisubmersible and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt sunder different water depths is performed considering second order hydrodynamic loads spectra and the time domain response of platform motions and mooring tension are presented the discussion has been made and useful conclusions can be summarized in the following aspects for the dynamic motion response the result shows that the difference frequency wave force can excite the responses at the natural frequency of all the semisubmersible fowts especially for the pitch motion also the results indicate that the pitch motion of oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is more sensitive than that of the other two semisubmersible fowts when considering the second order wave loads the std value of the motion responses show that compared with the newman s approximation method the std values of pitch motion lc 3 under water depth of 200 m for the semisubmersible fowts including the v shaped semisubmersible fowt braceless semisubmersible fowt and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt increased by 68 0 32 5 and 183 4 respectively using the full qtf method moreover the first order results show that the surge motion response decreases when considering the morison drag term on the column therefore the full qtf method is recommended to calculate the difference frequency wave force since the newman s approximation could underestimate the motion response also the morison drag term should be used for better simulating the actual motion responses the dynamic mooring tension response is mainly dominated by the response close to the surge natural frequency and wave frequency range compared to mooring tension of ml 2 and ml 3 the std values of the mooring tension show that ml 1 is more sensitive for the first order solution the mooring tension is overestimated when ignoring the morison drag term on the column as it is can be seen in table 10 under the extreme sea condition the ml 1 tension of the v shaped semisubmersible braceless semisubmersible and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is decreased by 16 0 12 9 and 26 9 respectively in the water depth of 200 m for the second order solution compared to newman s approximation solution dynamic mooring tension response is more severe in the full qtf solution for the dynamic response under different water depth the results show that the motion and mooring tension response is larger in the moderate water depth which could cause fatigue damage in long term and then threaten the safety of fowts and the results also show that the contribution of second order wave forces increasing when the water depth decreases especially for pitch motion the comparative results of the motion performance for three semisubmersible fowts in different water depth showing that the braceless semisubmersible fowt is more sensitive to the change of water depth as shown in fig 4 the heave motion response of oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible is larger than that of the other two semisubmersible fowt for the extreme sea condition for the reason that the natural frequency of heave mode is close to the normal wave frequency range which causes large resonance in the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt therefore the heave natural frequency of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt should be thoroughly considered credit authorship contribution statement lixian zhang

21824,floating structures have become the most feasible solution for supporting wind turbines when offshore wind project move to deeper water in this paper a hydrodynamic analysis of three different semisubmersible floating offshore wind turbines is carried out including second order hydrodynamic effects the three examined platforms are v shaped semisubmersible braceless semisubmersible and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible and are used to support the nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine the main objective of the present study is to investigate and compare the hydrodynamic response of the three different semisubmersible floaters in two water depths 100 m and 200 m under different load conditions the effects of second order wave loads on the platform motions and mooring tension are discussed and compared by using different methods including newman s approximation and the full qtf quadratic transfer function method the drag effect on the structure motion response is also discussed in this paper the comparison presented is based on statistical values and response spectra of floating platform motions as well as mooring tensions the results show that the dynamic response of semisubmersible fowts floating offshore wind turbines is overestimated when ignoring the morison drag effect on the columns of the semisubmersible fowt the second order difference wave loads can excite the resonance of motion especially for the platform pitch motion which could cause structural failures the full qtf method should be used to calculate the second order wave force to better simulate the realistic dynamic response of semisubmersible fowts keywords hydrodynamic loads second order wave loads semisubmersible floating wind turbines newman s approximation quadratic transfer function 1 introduction wind energy has experienced rapid development in recent years moving from onshore to offshore at the end of 2018 18 499 mw of installed wind turbine power capacity from a total of 4543 offshore wind turbines was installed decastro et al 2019 most offshore wind turbines are installed in shallow water with bottom fixed foundations shi et al 2015 2016 mo et al 2017 chian et al 2018 in many countries including china norway and the usa the main portion of offshore wind resources is found in deep water where the bottom fixed supporting structures are not economically feasible floating offshore wind turbines fowts provide a promising solution in deep water areas in china the offshore resources in shallow water are estimated to be 750 gw at 10 m height while the offshore resources in deep water are estimated to be 1740 gw hong and möller 2011 to explore the wind energy in deep water sites many concepts have been proposed for fowts by utilizing technology and experience from the offshore oil and gas industry based on the principles adopted to achieve static stability floating support platforms can be classified into three primary concepts semisubmersible spar buoy and tension leg platform tlp some designs are in the prototype stage including the full scale projects hywind demo driscoll et al 2016 in norway windfloat maciel 2010 in portugal fukushima phase ii fowt boccard 2014 in japan and hywind scotland skaare 2017 in the uk etc compared to spar buoy and tlp the semisubmersible platform is more feasible in various water depths and has low installation costs of the mooring system the semisubmersible platform has better hydrodynamic behaviour due to the deep draft several concepts of semisubmersible floating offshore wind turbines have been proposed including windfloat roddier et al 2010 dutch tri floater huijs et al 2014 windsea lefranc and torud 2011 windflo le boulluec et al 2013 braceless luan et al 2016 v shaped karimirad and michailides 2015 oc4 deepcwind robertson et al 2014 semisubmersible fowts currently several numerical simulations of fowts antonutti et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 shi et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 have been carried out to investigaite the dynamic performance of semisubmersible fowts using first order radiation and diffraction however the offshore oil and gas industry has demonstrated the importance of second order hydrodynamic load for certain floating platform the second order wave loads mainly include mean drift force sum and difference frequency wave loads the sum frequency and difference frequency loads can excite offshore structures eigenfrequencies and may result in large oscillations that cause damage to the floating structures roald et al 2013 assessed the importance of second order wave forces on oc3 hywind spar and the umaine tlp the results show that the second order wave forces are very small for oc3 hywind while those are quite high on umaine tlp coulling et al 2013 used newman s approximation method in fast to consider the effect of second order wave force on oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt the results show that the second order difference frequency wave diffraction forcing played a significant role in the global response of the deepcwind semi submersible fowt li et al 2017 proposed a new concept of fowt and investigated the hydrodynamic response of the floating platform with an emphasis on the computation of second order difference frequency wave loads and their effects on the global rigid body motion response xu et al 2018 assessed the importance of second order hydrodynamics on the braceless semisubmersible floating offshore wind turbine concept using newman s approximation and the full qtf method gueydon et al 2014 used different codes including fast and anysim to investigate the second order effect on oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt the results show that the second order sum frequency loads appeared to have negligible effects on the motions while the effects of difference frequency load were larger the loads and responses of the system caused by the second order hydrodynamics were analyzed and compared to the first order hydrodynamic loads and induced motions in the frequency domain by bayati et al 2014 in this paper the main objective is to investigate hydrodynamic effects on the response of three different semisubmersible floating offshore wind turbines including the v shaped semisubmersible fowt the braceless semisubmersible fowt and the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt at different water depths addressing second order hydrodynamic loads hydrodynamic models are developed by using the ansys aqwa tool with the panel method ansys inc 2017 particular attention is given to second order hydrodynamics loadings using newman s approximation and the full qtf method the second order hydrodynamic loads and resulted responses are analyzed and compared with relevant loads responses and induced motions in the frequency domain for different water depths the effect of the second order hydrodynamic loads and water depth is examined for all three semisubmersible platforms in moderate water depths 40 m 100 m dynamic responses of semisubmersible fowt become larger than those in deep water for the responses of the three semisubmersible fowts at different water depth the results show that the braceless semisubmersible fowt is more sensitive in shallow water depth for the first order solution morison drag term has a significant impact on the platform motion showing that morison drag term should also be considered for better simulating the actual motion responses furthermore it is found that the heave natural frequency of oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is close to the normal wave frequency range which could cause large resonance and then cause the failure of the structure for second order solution motion responses can be excited when considering second order wave loads the results show that the pitch motion can be greatly excited when using the full qtf method compared to the pitch motion responses of three semisubmersible fowts at different water depth the contribution of second order wave loads to the pitch motion increasing when the water depth decreases therefore the full qtf method should be used in the numerical simulation of semisubmersible fowts to better capture the effect of second order wave loads the results presented in this paper may help resolve the fundamental design trade offs between different fowts 2 theoretical background it is important to design floating offshore wind turbines considering fluid structure interaction the force on the floating structures and motion of the platform caused by these interactions is one of the main subjects of marine hydrodynamics the hydrodynamics are mainly divided into two parts the influence of fluid motions on the structures diffraction and the influence of moving structures that lead to the wave generation radiation hydrostatics should also be accounted for to consider the effects of buoyancy and hydrostatic restoring forces the hydrodynamic loads can be estimated by using the morison equation potential flow theory hybrid methods or higher fidelity numerical modelling techniques e g computational fluid dynamics cfd the morison equation is mainly used to calculate the hydrodynamic loads for slender structures with small diameters compared with the wavelength for large volume structures diffraction and radiation are relatively important and potential flow theory is used to calculate the hydrodynamic loads acting on the platform 2 1 potential flow theory the potential flow theory faltinsen 1993 teng 2015 is used to calculate the hydrodynamics when designing marine structures potential flow theory considers the flow around a body to be incompressible inviscid and irrotational with negligible surface tension effects the hydrodynamic loads that usually affect the response of floating wind turbines consist of two parts first order wave loads and second order wave loads 2 1 1 first order wave loads for the first order wave calculations the load on the structure and platform motion have zero mean value and oscillate with the frequency of the incident wave faltinsen 1993 first order hydrodynamic wave load including incident wave loads diffraction wave loads and radiation wave loads can be described by 1 f f i f d f r 2 f i f d s i ω ρ w φ i n j d s s i ω ρ w φ d n j d s 3 f r x k ρ w ω s φ ik re n j d s x k ρ w s φ i k im n j d s a jk x k b jk x k where f i is the incident wave load f d is the diffraction wave load f r is the radiation wave load ω is the circular frequency of the wave n is the normal direction vector of the wet surface s is the area of the wet surface immersed in water φ i is the incident potential of the wave without the perturbation of the body φ d is the diffraction potential of the wave when the waves pass through the body ρ w is the density of the water n j is a direction vector φ i k re and φ i k im are the real and imaginary parts of the incident potential of the wave without the perturbation of the body respectively a jk and b jk are the added mass and radiation damping coefficients the indices k and j refer to the degrees of freedom dofs of the platform 2 1 2 second order wave loads second order hydrodynamic loads are proportional to the square of the wave amplitude and have frequencies that are equal to both the sum and the difference of pairs of incident wave frequencies this means that although the natural frequencies of the structure are designed to be outside the first order wave energy spectrum the second order loads may excite these frequencies therefore despite the normally small second order hydrodynamic loads the resonant effect may be significant second order wave exciting forces can be described in the frequency domain by decomposition into three terms newman 1967 fonseca et al 2008 pessoa et al 2010 1 mean drift force f m e a n 2 which is a frequency dependent mean value 2 difference frequency wave drift force f d i f f 2 which oscillates at difference wave frequencies 3 sum frequency wave force f s u m 2 which oscillates at sum wave frequencies according to pinkster 1975 the second order wave forces can be written as the summation of five different components when they are determined by direct pressure integration 4 f 2 w l 1 2 ρ g ξ r 1 ξ r 1 n d l i s 0 1 2 ρ φ 1 2 n d s ii s 0 ρ x φ 1 t n d s iii m s r x g iv s 0 ρ φ 2 t n d s v where ρ is the density of the water g is the gravitational acceleration n is the direction of the normal φ 1 is the first order velocity potential w l is the waterline ξ r 1 is the relative wave elevation s 0 is the mean wetted surface of the floating body x is the motion of the floating body m s is mass of the floating body m s is the mass matrix of floating structure r is the rotational transformation matrix of floating structure x g is the acceleration of the center of gravity φ 2 is the second order velocity potential components i to iv represent the mean drift force which is determined from the first order solution the mean drift force can be calculated by using the far field method or near field method the accuracy of the far field method is higher than that of the near field method but it can calculate the force in only three dofs by contrast near field solution can be used to calculate second order wave forces on a floating body in 6 dofs therefore the near field method is employed in the present paper to calculate the mean drift force based on the mean wetted body surface integration approach with regards to the semisubmersible floating offshore platform the slow drift wave force term 5 including the difference frequency force becomes more significant the difference frequency is close to the natural frequency of the semisubmersible platform which could cause the resonance of the floating system and could damage the structure the fifth component of equation 4 involves the second order velocity potential that can be calculated directly by using the near field solution the full qtf method compared to newman s approximation method the complete qtf matrix gives more accurate estimations of the low frequency loads however it requires the solution to the second order problem and the time series reconstruction is more time demanding therefore newman s approximation method is proposed mainly to avoid computing the second order velocity potential φ 2 and to improve computational efficiency for newman s approximation the drift force can be described by 5 p i j 0 5 a i a j p i i a i 2 p j j a j 2 6 q i j 0 where p i i p j j q i i and q j j are calculated from second order mean drift force solution therefore quadratic transfer functions qtf including p i j q i j can be calculated for semisubmersible floating platforms the most significant part of the dynamic response is at both the wave frequency and the structure natural frequency region therefore only the mean drift force and slowly varying drift force will be discussed since the difference frequency value is close to the natural frequency of the semisubmersible floating platform 2 2 viscous load in the potential flow theory the viscous effect from the flow is ignored in order to take into account the viscous force the drag term of the morison equation is used the viscous drag term of the morison equation for the fluid force acting on the cross section of a slender structural

forces with weight and buoyancy forces hydrodynamic forces from morison equation and forces from contact with the seabed 2 4 equation of motion the semisubmersible floating structure is represented by a six degree of freedom 6 dof rigid body the load model for the body accounts for the wave loads it is stated that in the present paper the emphasis is on the study of the hydrodynamic loads the

marine floating structures the large height of the wind turbine could cause instability of the floater although the wind effect is not included in the present paper which means the wind turbine is in a parked condition the weight of wind turbines components is considered during the simulation the wind turbine used in this paper was developed by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel usa it is a conventional three bladed upwind variable speed collective pitch controlled horizontal axis wind turbine the geometric properties of the wind turbine and tower are listed in table 1 jonkman et al 2009 3 2 semisubmersible floating platform model three different semisubmersible floating platforms including 1 the v shaped semisubmersible floating platform 2 the braceless semisubmersible floating platform and 3 the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible floating platform were considered to support the nrel 5 mw wind turbine at two different water depths the water depth is assumed to be 100 m and 200 m for each concept the three floating structures are illustrated in fig 2 and their properties are summarized in table 2 the v shaped semisubmersible fowt is designed by karimirad and michailides 2015 according to the concept of semisubmersible fowt in project fukushima forward forward 2014 it consists of one main column and two side columns connected by two pontoons different from the other two semisubmersible platforms v shaped semisubmersible fowt is not a symmetrical floating platform which the nrel 5 mw wind turbine is at the top of the main column it must be noted that v shaped semi fowt maintains the balance by setting different ballast heights for each column more detailed properties of the v shaped semisubmersible fowt are summarized in karimirad and michailides 2015 2016 the braceless semisubmersible fowt is designed by luan et al 2016 in norwegian university of science and technology ntnu according to the concept of oo star semisubmersible fowt borisade 2016 it is mainly composed of three side columns and one central column it is noted that the braceless semisubmersible fowt is symmetrical with nrel 5 mw wind turbine on the centre column three pontoons are used to connect central column and side columns more detailed information of braceless semisubmersible fowt can be found in luan 2018 the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is designed by nrel the oc4 deepcwind semisubmer sible fowt consists of one central column and three side columns it has heave plates at the bottom of the upper columns to reduce the heave motion of the floating system several braces including horizontal and diagonal braces are used to connect the columns detailed properties of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt are available in robertson et al 2014 the main reason we chose the aforementioned three semisubmersible fowts is that the three semisubmersible fowt represents different design ideas for semisubmersible fowts the v shaped semisubmersible fowt is an asymmetric structure without the bracings and both braceless semisubmersible fowt and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is symmetric structures with center column supporting the wind turbine systems different from oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt barceless semisubmersible fowt has no bracings to connect the center column and side columns those three semisubmersible fowts are different in preliminary design 3 3 mooring systems designs for 200 m and 100 m for the v shaped semisubmersible fowt the mooring system consists of three catenary mooring lines that are made of wire rope fig 3 a the mooring line is positioned with 150 between the main mooring line ml 1 and the side mooring lines ml 2 ml 3 while the angle between ml 2 and ml 3 is 60 the clump mass of the v shaped semisubmersible fowt is positioned at 82 m far from the fairlead of each mooring line for both 100 m and 200 m the relevant characteristics of the mooring line are shown in tables 3 and 4 the mooring system of braceless semisubmersible fowt fig 3 b consists of three catenary mooring lines that are positioned with 120 between the mooring lines each mooring line is attached at the outer columns of the semisubmersible fowt at a water depth of 18 m the clump masses of the braceless semisubmersible for 100 m water depth are heavier than those for 200 m water depth which is designed to maintain the similar pretension and stiffness in different water depths the initial oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is designed for 200 m water depth which has been utilized as a reference model for the mooring system design of 100 m water depth fig 3 c based on the original 200 m water depth design a 100 m water depth mooring line is designed to achieve the similar stiffness jeon et al 2013 pretension and natural frequency of the floating system in surge motion the properties of the 100 m depth mooring line are kept the same as those of the 200 m water depth mooring lines a clump mass is also added at each line to achieve similar pretension and stiffness detailed mooring line properties and other characteristics of the mooring system are shown in tables 3 and 4 3 4 design load cases based on the data li et al 2015 norway site 5 fig 4 was selected as a representative site for the simulation it should be noted that wind loads are not considered in the present paper the main objective of this paper is to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of different semisubmersible fowt at different water depths with emphasis on the second order wave loads therefore only wave conditions are considered in the present paper three different wave conditions including moderate and extreme conditions are listed in table 5 3 5 numerical setting in the simulation the hydrodynamic loads are calculated using the boundary element method bem based on potential flow theory and the morison equation potential flow theory is applied on both the columns and pontoons and the drag term of the morison equation is applied to the columns for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt the bracings are modelled using the morison equation in this paper first order wave load analysis of the motion in sea states is performed with aqwa naut ansys inc 2017 which involves meshing the total wet surface of a structure to create a hydrodynamic and hydrostatic model the nonlinear froude krylov and hydrostatic wave forces on the instantaneous wetted surface i e beneath the incident wave surface can be calculated in naut this calculation is performed at each time step along with the instantaneous values of all other forces accurate dynamic or kinematic properties of fluid particles beneath the wave surface are thus required for this purpose these forces are then applied via a mathematical model see equation 10 the position and velocity at the subsequent time step are found by integrating these accelerations in the time domain using a two stage predictor corrector numerical integration scheme for the second order hydrodynamic model the mean drift force can be calculated by using the far field method or near field method in the aqwa drif module ansys inc 2017 in aqwa drif module the qtf can be calculated by using the direct pressure integration method pinkster 1975 newman s approximation is also used to calculate the second order wave force 3 5 1 panel model the panel model was developed in ansys software and the mapped mesh method is employed to obtain a finer frequency domain simulation result for the semisubmersible fowts in the aqwa line module the number of meshes used for the v shaped semisubmersible the braceless semisubmersible and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible models are 11 691 23 562 and 14 735 respectively the panel model of the three semisubmersible numerical models is shown in fig 5 3 5 2 viscous drag model to calculate the viscous drag of each column and pontoon on the semisubmersible fowt by the morison equation a beam model was used in ansys software cd depends upon the reynolds number kc number surface roughness and so on according to germanischer lloyd standard wind 2005 the cd can be set to 0 70 when the reynolds number is beyond 2 50e5 in the present simulation the drag coefficient is set to 0 68 to simulate the viscous drag term on the columns and pontoons it should be noted that the viscous force on the columns is applied along the transverse direction also the axial viscous drag force is not considered in the present paper the diameter of columns for the v shaped semisubmersible fig 5 a and the braceless semisubmersible fig 5 b fowts are 9 0 m and 6 5 m respectively for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt fig 5 c the diameters of the bracings central column upper column and base column is 1 6 m 6 5 m 12 0 m and 24 0 m respectively for the v shaped semisubmersible fowt and braceless semisubmersible fowt the equivalent diameter of pontoons is 7 6 m and 8 3 m respectively the diameter of the columns and pontoons was set to 0 01 m to ignore the inertia force from the morision equation futhermore the drag coefficient is scaled to take into account the modified geometry of the beam model and maintain the same viscous effect contribution as in the real physical model this is achieved by satisfying the following relation 11 c d d c d d where c d and d are the equivalent drag coefficient and the diameter of the column in the beam model respectively the values used in the computation are shown in table 6 4 result and discussion 4 1 response amplitude operator rao response amplitude operators raos can be computed based on the linear wave theory in aqwa the raos show considerable excitation only in the surge heave and pitch modes therefore only these raos are presented in fig 6 the excitation at the other natural frequencies sway roll and yaw is considerably less because of the zero degree wave heading for the surge motion fig 6 a the results show that the raos are similar for the three semisubmersible fowts however the raos are larger at a water depth of 100 m than at a water depth of 200 m for the heave motion fig 6 b two peaks are observed for the v shaped semisubmersible fowt showing the coupling effect between the heave and pitch motions a large peak is presented for the heave response at the heave natural frequency of the braceless semisubmersible fowt which is away from the incident wave frequency region 0 3 rad s to 0 8 rad s one peak is also found at the heave natural frequency of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt which is close to the wave frequency region this could cause a large heave motion response when the wave frequency is near the heave natural frequency of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt for the pitch motion fig 6 c there are two peaks observed in the low frequency region which are in the heave and pitch natural frequency region for the v shaped semisubmersible fowt and one peak is found at the pitch natural frequency for both the braceless and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowts notably the pitch motion response in the wave frequency region of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is larger than that of the other two platforms and it can also be observed that the heave and pitch motion responses for the three semisubmersible fowts are higher at moderate water depth 4 2 time domain analysis 4 2 1 motion response in this section the time domain dynamic motion responses of three platforms in different sea conditions with two water depths are estimated in order to focus on the most critical motion response only surge heave and pitch motion are displayed the total simulation time of the three semisubmersible fowt is 3500 s and the first 500 s have not been considered for either for drawing spectrum or statistical results to ignore the transient effect due to the limited space in this paper only the motion time domain response of the v shaped semisubmersible fowt under the lc 1 condition at a 200 m water depth is shown in fig 7 moreover the statistical results of the three semisubmersible fowts are discussed in this section the effect of the morison drag term and second order difference frequency wave force as well as water depth were the main focal point in figs 8 10 the maximum oscillation amplitude of the second order solution is plotted along with the first order results the following conclusions can be drawn from figs 8 10 for surge motion the responses of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt are larger than those of the other two platforms both at 100 m and 200 m water depths the results of the first order solutions show that maximum surge motion responses are larger than those considering the drag term effect for the v shaped semisubmersible and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowts for the second order solution the maximum surge motion responses are similar for the three semisubmersible fowts showing that newman s approximation solution considering the second order effect is enough for the surge dof for heave motion the maximum motion response of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is lower than those of the other two platforms under moderate sea conditions while it is larger than those of the other two platforms in extreme sea conditions as shown in fig 4 b the raos of heave motion for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is lower than those for the other two fowts when the frequency is greater than 0 5 rad s therefore under moderate sea conditions where the wave frequency is greater than 0 5 rad s the responses of heave motion are lower for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt than for the other two platforms however the wave peak period in the extreme sea state lc 3 is close to the heave natural period of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt which excites the heave motion response of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt for the first order solution the morison drag term has limited impact on the heave motion for the second order solution the second order wave force can greatly excite the heave motion response while the difference in maximum heave motion responses between the solution from newman s approximation solution and the full qtf solution is small for the pitch motion these figures also reveal that the second order wave force effects are important responses concering the first order results as seen in figs 8 c 9 c and 10 c the pitch responses of second order solutions are larger than those of first order solutions showing that the second order wave forces should be thoroughly considered especially under extreme sea condition lc 3 compared with newman s approximation method the full qtf method is more accurate for the calculation of second order wave forces as observed in the plots the pitch motion responses can be greatly excited when using the full qtf method especially for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt under extreme sea condition lc 3 the amplitude of pitch motion is around 10 while those are almost 18 for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt it also can be observed that the contribution of second order wave forces to the pitch motion increasing when the water depth decreases therefore full qtf method is needed for the calculation of second order wave forces to better capture the actual motion dynamic response for semisubmersible fowts for the moderate sea conditions there is a great similarity regarding the standard deviation std therefore only the std values from the lc 1 condition and lc 3 condition are listed tables 7 and 8 show the standard deviation std results of the three semisubmersible fowts under different water depths in the lc 1 and lc 3 condition the surge motion response shows that the std value of each semisubmersible fowt is larger when ignoring the morison drag term comparing the results from different second order solutions the maximum surge motion is similar for the three semisubmersible fowts these results indicate that together with the maximum values in surge motion the accuracy of the second order wave force can be ensured in surge motion by using newman s approximation method notably the morison drag force applied to each column is the transverse drag force therefore it has little impact on the heave motion response as shown in tables 7 and 8 as it is can be observed in table 7 to table 8 the std value of the heave motion response increased dramatically for the v shaped semisubmersible and braceless semisubmersible fowts when using the full qtf method for the pitch motion the std values of three semisubmersible platforms changes dramatically especially for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowts tables 7 and 8 also show that the std value of the motion response is larger at a moderate water depth than those at a water depth of 200 m showing that the motion response of semisubmersible fowts should be thoroughly considered at moderate water depths it is worth noting that the std value of pitch motion responses for the three semisubmersible fowt is much larger in full qtf solution under extreme condition lc 3 the std value of pitch motion for these three semisubmersible fowt at 200 m water depth is increased by 67 0 32 0 and 183 4 respectively when using the full qtf method as we can see under the extreme sea condition of the full qtf solution when water depth decreases the std of the pitch responses for the v shaped semisubmersible braceless semisubmersible and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is increased by 19 08 32 35 and 23 16 respectively showing that the braceless semisubmersible fowt is more sensitive to the change of water depth in general the platform motion responses are larger when considering the second order force using the full qtf method in other words the maximum and std values of the motion responses indicate the need to calculate the second order wave force accurately along with the first order loads to obtain the realistic combined effect of low frequency wave loading on the overall system dynamics which is underestimated without considering the second order terms 4 2 2 mooring tension response the maximum mooring line tensions for ml 1 and ml 2 are shown in fig 11 to fig 13 the standard deviation std values of the mooring tension for the three semisubmersible fowts under the lc 1 and lc 3 conditions are shown in table 9 and table 10 notably there is a constant offset in the negative surge direction before reaching the static equilibrium for the v shaped semisubmersible fowt while the braceless and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowts do not have such an offset therefore the pretension of ml 1 is larger than those of the other two mooring lines for the v shaped semisubmersible fowt the maximum values of the mooring line tension in extreme sea conditions where the significant wave height is large are relatively larger than those in moderate sea conditions for all semisubmersible fowts the mooring line tension performance of the oc4 deepcwind and v shaped semisubmersible fowt is similar at the two water depths while the mooring line tension is larger at a water depth of 200 m than at a water depth of 100 m for the braceless semisubmersible fowt as shown in figs 11 13 despite the small orders of magnitude for the drag force it could reduce the motion response and then affect the mooring tension responses as seen in the first order solution the maximum values and std values of the mooring line tension are larger when ignoring the morison drag force effect on the platform therefore the drag term of the column should be thoroughly considered to better capture the actual mooring response for the three semisubmersible fowt the second order wave force could lead to large responses at resonance moreover the second order wave force did increase the maximum values and standard deviation values as shown in figs 10 12 and tables 9 10 the maximum value as well as the std values of mooring force in a water depth of 100 m is larger when using the full qtf method therefore the effect of second order wave force on the mooring line tension should be thoroughly considered when designing semisubmersible fowt and mooring systems for moderate water depths from tables 7 10 the std results show that there is a good correlation between the mooring tension and surge motion comparing the std values for forces of ml 1 to those for ml 2 3 force reveals that ml 1 tension changed more dramatically than ml 2 and 3 tension for all semisubmersible fowts which means that ml 1 is more sensitive to external loads these results show that ml 1 is more susceptible to fatigue damage than other mooring lines and then causes the failure of the supporting platforms for the mooring system design of semisubmersible fowts especially for triangular platforms the main mooring line should be strengthened to maintain the safety of the supporting structures 4 3 spectral analysis this section presents the frequency domain analysis results of the three semisubmersible fowt with a 0 degree incoming wave direction under three load cases at two water depths four load models are listed together for comparison the motion and mooring tension responses with and without drag force on the column are compared for the second order solution the difference frequency wave loads using two methods newman s approximation and the full qtf method are obtained to investigate the second order wave force effect on the motion and mooring tension responses of semisubmersible fowts 4 3 1 natural frequencies of the three fowts the natural frequency of the surge heave and pitch motion for the three fowts are calculated by performing numerical decay tests in aqwa time series of free decay tests on surge heave and pitch motions can be obtained from aqwa output results then the natural frequency of the three fowts can be calculated based on the fast fourier transform fft method cooley et al 1969 as shown in table 11 4 3 2 hydrodynamic load spectrum a comparison between the drag force and first order wave force of the three semisubmersible fowts in the lc 1 condition at a 100 m water depth is shown in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 compared to the first order wave force the drag force is very small even though the drag force is small its resonant effect can be significant a comparison between the first order wave force and drag force in the frequency domain shows that the drag force is more broad banded than the first order force which could cause large resonance in the low frequency region especially for surge mode fig 15 shows a comparison of the second order wave force among the three semisubmersible fowts under moderate sea condition lc 1 by using newman s approximation and the full qtf method the results show that the power spectral density is mainly concentrated in the difference frequency region when using newman s approximation while two peaks appear in the difference frequency and sum frequency region when using the full qtf method although the natural frequencies of the structure are designed to be outside the first order wave energy spectrum the second order loads may excite these frequencies the difference frequency is close to the natural frequency of the structures for semisubmersible fowts as shown in fig 15 b second order responses in the difference frequency region are higher when using the full qtf method than when using to newman s approximation method of the v shaped semisubmersible and braceless semisubmersible fowt while the responses obtained using the two methods are similar for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt this set of data indicates that the second order force calculated by the full qtf method can greatly excite heave motion response for the v shaped semisubmersible and braceless semisubmersible fowts fig 15 c shows that in the difference frequency region the second order force responses computed using the full qtf method were higher than the responses computed using newman s approximation method for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt the result indicates that the pitch motion of oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible is more sensitive than that of the other two platforms when considering the second order wave force 4 3 3 motion spectrum for moderate sea conditions there is a great similarity regarding the power spectra density psd therefore only the spectrum results in the lc 1 condition are listed fig 16 to fig 18 show the motion spectrum of the three semisubmersible fowts in the lc 1 at two water depths 1 for surge motion the spectra of the motion responses consist of two parts the low frequency part is related to the surge natural frequency while the higher frequency part is dominated by the frequency from 0 4 to 0 8 rad s which is related to the wave peak frequency for the first order solution the surge resonance peak decreases significantly due to the drag force on each column compared to the first line as shown in fig 16 this is similar to what is observed for the other platforms fig 16 b and c comparing the values with and without the drag force reveals that dynamic response of surge motion can be greatly decreased by adding the morison drag force on the column therefore it is vitally significant to consider the drag term when designing and performing the computation of semisubmersible fowts newman s approximation method is suitable for surge resonant motion response while it doesn t apply to the heave or pitch resonant responses it can be seen from figs 16 and 17 that the heave and pitch resonant response in the low frequency region is underestimated therefore the full qtf method should be used for modelling the difference frequency wave force to better simulate the low frequency motion 4 3 4 mooring tension spectrum the mooring line responses in the frequency domain in the head for sea under the lc 1 condition of the three semisubmersible fowts are shown in figs 19 21 due to the symmetry of the mooring line configuration of the three platforms only the mooring line responses of ml 1 and ml 2 are displayed in this paper for the v shaped semisubmersible fowt the most significant contribution to the ml 1 tension comes from wave frequency range from 0 4 rad s to 0 8 rad s while for ml 2 and 3 the most significant contribution comes from the low frequency region surge motion response the contribution from the low frequency response increases with decreasing water depth a small peak is observed at approximately 0 25 rad s pitch natural frequency showing the coupling effect between surge and pitch modes the first order solution results show that the effect of drag force on the column becomes more significant as the water depth decreased it can also be seen that second order surge resonant responses fig 19 seem similar when using the two methods to perform the calculations of the difference frequency wave force at both water depths for the braceless semisubmersible fowt the mooring line tension responses consist of two parts the wave frequency range from 0 4 rad s to 0 8 rad s and the low frequency region including the surge pitch and heave mode response similar to the v shaped semisubmersible fowt the contribution from the low frequency response increases while the high frequency response wave frequency decreases for the second order solution the surge resonant responses are slightly higher when using the full qtf method than when using the newman s approximation to perform the difference frequency wave force calculation for the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt in contrast to the other two platforms the most significant contribution to the mooring line tension comes from the low frequency region the coupling effect between structural modes including the surge and pitch modes is shown in fig 21 compared to the other two platforms the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fow show similar performance in the dynamic response of mooring line tension in the frequency domain at the two water depth similar to the braceless semisubmersible fowt surge resonant responses are slightly higher when using the full qtf method than when using newman s approximation method to calculate the difference frequency wave force 5 conclusions in this paper a comparative study of hydrodynamic performance among the v shaped semisubmersible braceless semisubmersible and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt sunder different water depths is performed considering second order hydrodynamic loads spectra and the time domain response of platform motions and mooring tension are presented the discussion has been made and useful conclusions can be summarized in the following aspects for the dynamic motion response the result shows that the difference frequency wave force can excite the responses at the natural frequency of all the semisubmersible fowts especially for the pitch motion also the results indicate that the pitch motion of oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is more sensitive than that of the other two semisubmersible fowts when considering the second order wave loads the std value of the motion responses show that compared with the newman s approximation method the std values of pitch motion lc 3 under water depth of 200 m for the semisubmersible fowts including the v shaped semisubmersible fowt braceless semisubmersible fowt and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt increased by 68 0 32 5 and 183 4 respectively using the full qtf method moreover the first order results show that the surge motion response decreases when considering the morison drag term on the column therefore the full qtf method is recommended to calculate the difference frequency wave force since the newman s approximation could underestimate the motion response also the morison drag term should be used for better simulating the actual motion responses the dynamic mooring tension response is mainly dominated by the response close to the surge natural frequency and wave frequency range compared to mooring tension of ml 2 and ml 3 the std values of the mooring tension show that ml 1 is more sensitive for the first order solution the mooring tension is overestimated when ignoring the morison drag term on the column as it is can be seen in table 10 under the extreme sea condition the ml 1 tension of the v shaped semisubmersible braceless semisubmersible and oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt is decreased by 16 0 12 9 and 26 9 respectively in the water depth of 200 m for the second order solution compared to newman s approximation solution dynamic mooring tension response is more severe in the full qtf solution for the dynamic response under different water depth the results show that the motion and mooring tension response is larger in the moderate water depth which could cause fatigue damage in long term and then threaten the safety of fowts and the results also show that the contribution of second order wave forces increasing when the water depth decreases especially for pitch motion the comparative results of the motion performance for three semisubmersible fowts in different water depth showing that the braceless semisubmersible fowt is more sensitive to the change of water depth as shown in fig 4 the heave motion response of oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible is larger than that of the other two semisubmersible fowt for the extreme sea condition for the reason that the natural frequency of heave mode is close to the normal wave frequency range which causes large resonance in the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt therefore the heave natural frequency of the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible fowt should be thoroughly considered credit authorship contribution statement lixian zhang
