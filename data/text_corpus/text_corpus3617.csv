18085,diffused aeration is the most implemented method for oxygen transfer in municipal activated sludge systems and governs the economics of the entire treatment process empirical observations are typically used to regulate airflow distribution through the adjustment of manual valves however due to the associated degrees of freedom the identification of a combination of manual valves that optimizes all performance criteria is a complex task for the first time a multi criteria optimization algorithm was used to minimize effluent constituents and energy use by parametrizing manual valves positions data from a full scale facility in conjunction with specific model assumptions were used to develop a base case facility consisting of a detailed air supply model a bio kinetic model and a clarification model compared to the base case condition trade offs analysis showed potential energy savings of up to 13 6 and improvement of effluent quality for nh4 up to 68 5 and nox up to 81 6 based on two different tariff structures of a local power utility maximum costs savings of 12800 usd mo 1 to 19000 usd mo 1 were estimated compared to baseline condition graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater aeration air valve multi objective pareto 1 introduction water resource recovery facilities wrrfs provide the important service of collecting treating and transforming the various contaminants present in municipal wastewaters however for these systems to properly function significant energy is required for onsite operations wef 2009 longo et al 2016 the required oxic conditions in the aerobic tanks for the degradation of pollutants are commonly achieved through sub surface diffused aeration diffused aeration has gained wide implementation since it guarantees higher oxygen transfer efficiency than other available methods groves et al 1992 rosso et al 2008 air needs to be pressurized by blowers and routed to the different reactor zones via a piping network in order for the air bubbles to be released from the diffusers blowers are required to overcome the hydrostatic pressure the frictional pressure losses of the piping system and the dynamic wet pressure of the diffusers due to the high power demand required for the blowers to operate diffused aeration is the most energy intensive process in wrrfs representing as much as 45 75 of the energy use olsson 2015 reardon 1995 rosso et al 2008 the growing emphasis towards energy footprint minimization coupled with the ever more stringent effluent discharge limits has propelled more research on the study of air supply systems rosso et al 2008 zhu and anderson 2017 since the advent of dynamic simulators for wastewater treatment the ability to analyze different operational strategies in a non invasive manner has improved significantly gernaey et al 2004 many control strategies have been implemented in several simulation environments to study the optimization of diffused aeration systems åmand et al 2013 control structures based on dissolved oxygen do set points ekman et al 2006 and ammonia based aeration control abac rieger et al 2014 2012 uprety et al 2016 are well known and have been applied to achieve improved effluent quality in addition other control schemes such as most open valve mov are used to lower pressure drop thus reducing blower power demand by setting the valve with the highest percent opening to a defined value typically between 85 and 95 jens et al 2016 vreč ko et al 2014 regardless of the specific control structure considered valve stem positions are among the main manipulated variables used in control systems to improve aeration treatment performance jenkins 2014 however detailed models of actual equipment components such as diffusers blowers pipes and valves have only been marginally implemented in simulation studies of air supply systems juan garcía et al 2018 in fact the vast majority of dynamic simulation studies completed thus far assumes an ideal continuous supply of airflow capable of matching demand requirements thus neglecting the physical and operational limitations of the air delivery components ingildsen et al 2002 zhu and anderson 2017 the operating boundaries of aeration equipment such as blower turndown and maximum diffuser pressure drop are critical for a realistic description of dynamic control strategies amaral et al 2017 in fact the simulation of control strategies that do not explicitly account for equipment specifications may limit accurate model prediction or even conceal the applicability of the control action itself juan garcía et al 2018 it has been only in recent years that process models have moved from ideal air supply to ad hoc equipment models the first reported attempt to develop a detailed model of air supply systems in wrrfs can be found in jens et al 2002 in that work the airflow in the network of pipes is modeled as a repeating sequence of storage volumes and resistances the inlet and outlet pressure of the storage volumes is used to calculate the mass flow rates between them a subsequent integrated model was proposed in schraa et al 2017 which includes a more detailed representation of site specific equipment such as blowers valves and diffusers this has allowed describing more realistically the interactions occurring between the aeration system oxygen supply side the biological reactors oxygen demand side and the control system more recently the work from juan garcía et al 2018 shows the use of a detailed air supply system model for the comparative analysis of various energy optimization strategies for a 55 000 m3 d 1 14 5 mgd capacity facility however even the most recent and advanced studies are conducted without a prior selection of an optimal set of manual valves these differently from the throttled valves used for dynamic control are seldom adjusted and are used to ensure a correct distribution of the airflow to the various aerated zones it is common praxis for manual valves to be adjusted empirically through a trial and error approach without fully considering the trade offs occurring between the effluent water quality constituents and the energy use juan garcía et al 2018 in fact any adjustment to the openings of a set of manual valves will establish different airflow distribution as well as pressure drop across the piping network which can affect both effluent quality and power demand respectively conflicting objectives such as achieving low effluent concentrations bod5 nh4 etc while also reducing operating costs hakanen et al 2013 are a commonly encountered challenge among facility operators the analysis of the trade offs that occur for different combinations of manual valves can be done by implementing a multi objective optimization algorithm also known as multi criteria multi objective optimization algorithms allow to find a set of pareto optimal solutions also known as pareto front each solution represents a point in a n dimensional space having as coordinates the values of the n objectives deb 2001 each solution located on the pareto front is considered non dominated meaning that each one represents the best option given a specific set of criteria i e they cannot achieve further improvements in terms of any one objective unless at the expense of another several examples of multi objective optimization analysis are found in wastewater treatment applications such as pi controller coefficients sweetapple et al 2014 hydraulic retention time sludge retention time internal recirculation zhang et al 2014 airflow rates sludge wastage and recirculated activated sludge hreiz et al 2015 however a systematic multi objective optimization of water quality and energy use of air supply systems by varying manual valves was heretofore missing the goal of this study is to demonstrate the impacts that different combinations of manual valve openings have on energy use costs and effluent quality by using an advanced air supply system model moreover a multi objective optimization analysis is applied for the first time by using manual valve positions as parameters to minimize effluent concentrations and energy use data from a facility combined with model assumptions were used to develop a base case scenario configuration of a secondary treatment which was then compared to the optimized pareto solutions a total of 5 objective functions were investigated energy use maximum daily nh4 concentration maximum daily bod5 concentrations maximum daily tss concentrations and monthly average nox concentrations a trade off analysis is then conducted for the objectives that are most sensitive to the various optimal manual valve combinations 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant layout and operation the facility that was considered for the case study is located in the southwestern united states characterized by arid to semi arid climate the plant receives an average of 1 7 105 m3 day 1 or approximately 45 mgd of municipal sewage from a separate sewer network the biological compartment is operated in step feed mode a total of 5 parallel units see fig 1 are configured for biological nutrient removal bnr no supplement carbon is added originally the plant was designed and constructed with 3 parallel lines stage 1 two additional units identical to the existing ones were subsequently added stage 2 each unit is comprised of 4 passes in series each divided in 3 grids an anoxic oxic oxic sequence is used for the first two passes an anoxic swing oxic for the third and an oxic oxic oxic for the fourth the three step feed gates are situated at the beginning of the anoxic grids excess sludge is wasted from the recirculating activated sludge ras line and discharged back to the sewer system for subsequent downstream processing by a centralized plant in this study the wrrf had to meet the following local regulatory discharge limits for a nearby river maximum daily bod5 45 mg l 1 maximum daily tss 45 mg l 1 maximum daily ammonium 6 mg l 1 and monthly average nox 8 mg l 1 the blower house contains five centrifugal blowers three 1300 kw 1750 hp each and two 670 kw 900 hp air from the blowers is routed to a main manifold from which is then distributed to 10 headers each header serves 2 adjacent passes for each of the 5 units a total of 71 valves are used to adjust or isolate the airflow in the piping network 10 valves for each header 60 valves for each drop leg and 1 valve between stage 1 from stage 2 the aeration system was initially constructed with manual valves and was later complemented with some automatic valves despite this combination of manual and automatic valves during the optimization phase the valves were assumed to be all fixed as in their initial configuration this assumption stems from the decision to consider the potential benefits and trade offs that can be achieved by optimizing fixed manual valves positions prior to the implementation of a dynamic valve control system such a valve configuration although not ideal is still a commonly encountered condition in many activated sludge processes in wrrfs around the world guerrero et al 2011 ma et al 2010 qiu et al 2010 air delivery is achieved through the implementation of ceramic disc diffusers 9 inches 230 mm in diameter airflow is provided based on an open loop time based control system 2 2 modeling framework and boundaries the framework of the study is based on the most recent protocols hsg guideline and gmp unified protocol for modeling wastewater treatment processes langergraber et al 2004 rieger et al 2013 for the specific case of optimization of air supply systems a more detailed flow chart is provided in figure a2 see appendix the flow chart outlines the various analytical steps to use when optimizing existing air supply systems the model boundary contains the entire secondary treatment process the scope of the study encompasses the optimization analysis for an air supply system that adopts fix manual valves as a mean to regulate airflow distribution without considering control structures of dynamically actuated valves to achieve the goal of the study equipment sub models are included for a more realistic description of air re distribution and pressure drop across the piping network which ultimately affects local oxygen transfer rates and overall power demand data collected from a full scale facility was used to set up a detailed model version of the air supply system and to perform the calibration and validation of the air supply system model tank size and process configuration were retrieved from facility s blueprints due to limited effluent data available the biokinetic and settling parameters are based on default literature values implemented in previous studies aymerich et al 2015 santín et al 2015 therefore the detailed air supply model along with the biokinetic and clarifier model are used to develop a baseline model that is then compared to the various optimized scenarios this study focuses on the concurrent optimization of energy use and various water quality constituents tss bod5 nh4 nox this is achieved by searching for the optimal manual valve combinations operating costs were estimated by implementing two local tariff structures in the integrated model to generalize the applicability of the study costs were not included in the objective functions since they can be influenced by the specific geographic location such as the energy tariff structure that a utility is enrolled in in addition for an optimization analysis of manual valves that consider a tariff structure based on the user s energy use and or peak power demand charge the selection of either energy or costs does not influence the relative ranking in performance of each of the manual valve combinations 2 3 field data acquisition and pre processing regular site inspections were conducted to assess the current plant layout and evaluate the operating status of the modeled equipment blueprints of the aeration system were obtained from plant engineers and were used for the development of a detailed aeration model specifications of the reactor tanks and clarifiers were incorporated in the reactor and clarifier models step feed flow ratios used in the model were retrieved from on site flow monitoring daily average split ratios values were used in the model although it is known that flow split ratios can vary as the function of influent flow rates patel et al 2008 flow splits are assumed to not change over time operational variables such as valve positions airflow measurements and blower operating schedule were obtained during the field visits valve positions that were inaccessible at the time of plant visits were assumed in the model to be fully open specifications of equipment such as blower curves valve curves and diffuser curves were retrieved from the respective equipment manufacturers see appendix due to the relatively high dynamics of variables such as airflow and pressure in air supply systems a 10 min sampling rate is used for model inputs and outputs more details are provided in table 1 for both inputs and outputs used during model calibration and validation whenever data values were missing or fragmented a signal reconstruction algorithm was employed firstly noise smoothing and outlier removal using a moving mean with 2 sigma criterion is performed followed by the processing and exclusion of signal artifacts such as the automatic linear interpolation across missing data points after an initialization phase tin 100 d for the achievement of steady state conditions dynamic simulations were run over a 14 day period diurnal influent profiles of ammonium and flowrate were used as model inputs two hourly measurements of dynamic alpha factors were used to account for the diurnal variability in oxygen transfer efficiency see appendix daily measurements of primary effluent constituents obtained from grab samples were used for the characterization and generation of the secondary influent constituents profiles devisscher et al 2006 martin and vanrolleghem 2014 2 4 model structure 2 4 1 secondary treatment process model various sub models were adopted to simulate the dynamic response of the bio reactors clarifiers and air supply system the model equations were implemented in the simulink platform from mathworks by using customizable diagram blocks see appendix the main biological processes occurring in the activated sludge tanks are modeled using the asm1 structure henze et al 1987 van loosdrecht et al 2015 the asm1 model was deemed appropriate due to the study s specific modeling objectives and also the absence of large anaerobic anoxic zones which would have otherwise precluded its selection in favor of other bio kinetic models langergraber et al 2004 wet weather events occur sporadically in the region under study hence it is relatively easy to collect a continuous dataset of hydraulic and suspended solids load the secondary settling tanks have been modeled using a spatially discretized layered clarifier model that accounts for concentration driven settling behavior takács et al 1991 the air supply distribution was modeled similarly to other studies with equipment components such as the blower battery piping system valves and diffusers amaral et al 2017 juan garcía et al 2018 schraa et al 2017 as thoroughly presented in schraa et al 2015 and schraa et al 2017 the air supply system equipment sub models are linked together by using physical gas models block diagrams which although use a different simulation environment are based on the same physical equations however specific equipment curves such as blowers diffusers and valves were alternatively modeled by implementing directly the manufacturer curves into the simulink model by using a 2 d look up table block in this study a time based open loop blower control with inlet guide vanes is used to maintain preconfigured diurnal profiles of dynamic airflow rates regardless of pressure differential pipe elements comprising the air distribution system were modeled by implementing the pre configured blocks available in the gas system library of the simscape toolbox from mathworks similarly valves were modeled by using the variable local restriction block from simscape diffusers were modeled by using a localized flow resistance block which was calibrated using the manufacturer dynamic wet pressure dwp curves in addition sote curves from the diffuser manufacturer were implemented using 2 d look up table blocks table 2 provides a list of specifications for the different aeration components that were modeled including the type of data collected from the equipment manufacturers the inclusion of flow restrictions diffusers and valves is attained by modeling them as localized pressure drops in the simscape environment the contribution of the diffuser s control orifices to the overall pressure loss has been often overlooked in previous optimization studies of air supply systems due to their quadratic response to changes in airflow rate the pressure drop of control orifices will become significant at higher airflow rates in fact for higher diffuser airflow rates 3 4 scfm diffuser 1 orifice headlosses of disc diffusers are 3 6 times higher than the dwp epa 1989 as such diffuser s orifice contribution to the overall pressure drop should always be included in models of air supply systems since the orifices pressure loss curves were not readily available the local aggregate pressure loss of the pipes serving the diffusers was parametrized in order to simulate the orifice pressure drop however the parametrization of orifice pressure drops during the calibration phase together with the distributed losses of the piping system can lead to an underestimation of the actual orifice pressure losses since their contribution might be averaged out across the rest of the distribution system when valve flow coefficient curves cv kv curves are available redistribution of air mass flow rates can be estimated as a function of valve stem opening schraa et al 2015 skousen 1998 in this study the cv curves are used to estimate the pressure drop as a result of different valve openings the model used here thus allows capturing the redistribution of air between parallel units as a result of pressure rise due to partial valve closing modeling changes in airflow distribution grants the possibility to track changes of oxygen transfer rates otrs across different zones which ultimately impacts dissolved oxygen levels for further information regarding the simscape model blocks used in the air supply model the reader is referred to the online mathworks documentation on gas models 2 4 2 tariff structure the importance of improving model predictions with structured energy tariffs was discussed previously by aymerich et al 2015 and amerlinck et al 2016 compared to previous simulation studies of air supply system the herein study also incorporates different energy tariff structures in order to account for the aeration operating costs due to the complexity of the actual tariff structure of the facility under study i e energy purchase from retail markets based on day ahead and real time energy markets operating costs were instead estimated based on the main local energy provider time of use tou structures the introduction of renewable energy sources in the region under study has led the main local energy provider to change the tou structure in order to include the costs implications that derive when implementing different tariff structures both the previous and newer local energy tariff structures were considered in this study see fig 2 summer tariffs were selected to match the season of field data collection the total costs linked to the electricity use was obtained for each of the two tariffs structures by summing the delivery costs and the generation costs in addition power demand charges were included in the final cost estimations for each of the two tariffs see appendix the old tariff presented a power demand charge of 6 56 usd kw 1 whereas the new one is of 5 08 usd kw 1 both old and new tariffs are typical of large service contracts i e 50 kv in fig 2 charts a and b report the tariff structure prior to the switch for both weekdays and weekends respectively similarly charts c and d show the new tariffs for both weekdays and weekends the old tariff is characterized by three tiers during the weekdays off peak mid peak and on peak and a single constant off peak tier during weekends the newest tariff instead uses a two tier structure during both weekdays off peak on peak and weekends off peak mid peak for more details on energy tariff structures in wrrfs more information can be retrieved in aymerich et al 2015 2 5 model calibration and validation analogously to the work presented in amerlinck et al 2016 model calibration and validation was partitioned in two stages at first the calibration validation of the equipment sub models such as blowers valves and diffusers was conducted by using manufacturer data sheets manufacturer curves of valves flow coefficient cv and diffusers dwp and sote were implemented by an approximate two dimensional function block from simulink the prior calibration of the equipment sub models allows to mitigate the propagation of parameter uncertainties while also reducing the number parameters used in the integrated model physical parameters such as pipe diameters pipe lengths and manual valve positions were obtained from the facility blueprints and through direct field readings secondly a calibration and validation of the complete air supply system was performed previous studies have used various measurements for the calibration of the air supply system such as blower power amerlinck et al 2016 pressure discharge and airflow rate juan garcía et al 2018 in this study the calibration of the overall air supply system was performed by using the measurements of pressure discharge and power demand from the blowers as also mentioned in schraa et al 2017 the main parameters used to calibrate the overall air supply system were aggregate local resistances for the pipes serving the diffusers and local resistances for the main header lines in addition since the blower efficiency curves were not retrievable the parameters used to calculate the efficiency curve of the blowers were also included in the global calibration of the air supply system the calibration and validation of the air supply system was conducted by using power and pressure profiles of blower 1 2 and 5 data from blower 3 was partly fragmented for the period considered and thus was not used for either the calibration or validation stage data from blower 4 could only be used during the calibration phase but not during validation since for that period the blower underwent duty rotation with blower 5 this is clearly visible in fig 3 b where the power demand of blower 4 drops and is followed by the powering on of blower 5 the first 7 days of the data set were used for calibration whereas the subsequent 7 days were used for validation following validation the model displays good predictive capabilities as seen in fig 3 around day 6 the predicted values for pressure of blower 2 diverge from actual measurements this was due to a temporary maintenance event during which the blower was offline in addition the pressure peaks for both day 2 and day 5 are overestimated the reason behind these concurrent overpredicted pressure peaks for both blower 1 and blower 2 is likely to be attributed to epistemic model uncertainty 2 6 multi objective optimization 2 6 1 optimization algorithm local optimization algorithms provide an efficient method for finding local optima within a convex parameter space however local optimizers can lead to suboptimal solutions for complex optimization problems with many local optima and a nonlinear parameter space for nonlinear optimization studies of wrrfs genetic algorithms have proven to be a more robust method for the search of the global optimum the ability of genetic algorithms to efficiently search intractably large nonlinear parameters spaces has led to their use in recent optimization studies of wastewater treatment plants de faria et al 2016 fang et al 2011 guerrero et al 2011 hreiz et al 2015 sweetapple et al 2014 several of these studies rely on a single biological model for natural selection and adaptation which presumes that a single evolutionary method exists that efficiently evolves a population of potential solutions through the parameter space however existing theory and numerical experiments have shown that it is impossible to develop a single evolutionary algorithm that is consistently efficient for a different set of optimization problems rahnamay naeini et al 2018 vrugt and robinson 2007 multi algorithm genetic search methods have been shown to provide greater robustness and applicability across different optimization problems when compared to single meta heuristic search algorithms vrugt and robinson 2007 therefore due to the high dimensionality and nonlinearity of valve optimization problems åmand et al 2013 the selection of the shuffled complex self adaptive hybrid evolution sc sahel algorithm rahnamay naeini et al 2018 was favored over local optimizers and other single evolutionary search methods the sc sahel algorithm was used for both model calibration and optimization of the multiple objectives for more details on the optimization method used the reader is referred to the appendix 2 6 2 optimization parameters and objectives all the manual valves are parametrized and used for the generation of a population of different sets of manual valve combinations while all of the dynamic input profiles see table 1 are maintained unaltered this population is then partitioned in different complexes that evolve in parallel during the multi objective optimization search a total of five objective functions have been selected daily maximum tss daily maximum bod5 daily maximum nh4 monthly average nox and energy use the objectives were calculated for each simulation by means of the following equations 1 of n h 4 max n h 4 e f f t 1 n h 4 e f f t 1 δ t n h 4 e f f τ 2 of n h 4 max n h 4 e f f t 1 n h 4 e f f t 1 δ t n h 4 e f f τ 3 of t s s max t s s e f f t 1 t s s e f f t 1 δ t t s s e f f τ 4 of n o x mean n o x e f f t 1 n o x e f f t 1 δ t n o x e f f τ 5 of e n e r g y t 1 τ p t δ t where δ t is the simulation timestep and τ is the final simulation time conversely from other studies that use aggregate performance indexes the water quality objectives were selected based on generic regional regulatory standards the adoption of effluent quality metrics for the definition of the objective functions provides a more realistic and practical target since it reflects regional regulatory standards which are ultimately in line with the goals of the municipal wastewater treatment utility 3 results 3 1 pareto fronts and objectives sensitivity from the multi objective optimization phase the set of pareto solutions are retrieved each one corresponding to a different combination of manual valve positions each pareto solution exists in a 5 dimensional space for which the coordinates represent a specific value of each of the different objectives considered appendix a 7 daily maximum tss daily maximum bod5 daily maximum nh4 monthly average nox and energy use the non dominated solutions pareto front represent the points performing equally well in every objective and better in at least one relative to all other points the sensitivity of each objective to the set of optimized manual valve combinations was measured by their coefficient of variation cv which is a standardized method used to measure and compare the dispersion of different frequency distributions the cv is defined as the ratio between the standard deviation sigma and the mean of a population cv σ μ among the 423 pareto solutions nh4 nox and energy use resulted the most impacted by the different possible combinations of valve stem positions cv values of 0 43 0 35 and 0 12 respectively lower sensitivities are instead seen for bod5 and tss having a coefficient of variation of 10 2 and 2 10 3 respectively 3 2 extreme pareto solutions due to the relatively low sensitivity of effluent bod5 and tss the pareto analysis was focused exclusively on the three most sensitive effluent objectives nh4 nox and energy use fig 4 highlights three points representing the extreme pareto solutions each of these solutions is generated by a specific valve combination which establishes the lowest possible value for either nh4 nox or energy use a square symbol was used to identify the solution linked to the valve combination yielding the lowest daily maximum ammonium concentration as seen in fig 4a this solution is expected to produce an effluent with a maximum ammonium concentration of 0 75 mgnh4 l 1 68 5 than baseline conditions with an energy consumption of 698 6 mwh 11 5 than baseline conditions from fig 4b the same square solution results in a monthly average nox concentration of 7 24 mgnox l 1 94 1 more than baseline conditions on the other hand a circle symbol is used to denote the solution yielding the lowest value for nox which is expected to yield a monthly average nox effluent concentration of 0 69 mgnox l 1 81 6 than baseline condition fig 4b the same solution also projects an energy consumption of 653 6 mwh 4 4 than baseline conditions and maximum ammonium concentration of 5 54 mgnh4 l 1 131 3 more than baseline conditions fig 4a it can be noted that even if the square and circle solutions provide the lowest value for either one of the water quality objectives they will not benefit the effluent concentration of the other objective the solution that ensures the minimum energy use 542 1 mwh 13 6 less than baseline conditions is marked by a triangle which results in a detrimental increase of both the effluent objectives 3 85 mgnh4 l 1 and 5 98 mgnoxl 1 61 2 and 60 3 increase hence although each of the extreme solutions provides the lowest values for each of the three objectives it does so by increasing the others 3 3 trade off analysis of pareto regions of operation a comprehensive analysis on the trade offs between the three objectives is presented in the following section the effluent regulatory limits and the model baseline are used as a constraint for classifying the various non dominated solutions based on this classification a total of eight regions of operation are identified as shown in fig 5 solutions contained in each region display different trade offs between nh4 nox and energy use while still ensuring compliance with effluent limits different markers are used to identify each solution white stars improvement in all criteria orange circles improvement in nh4 and energy use but not nox orange squares improvement in nox and energy use but not nh4 violet crosses improvement in nox and nh4 but not energy use blue circles improvement in only nh4 blue squares improvement in only nox yellow triangles improvement in only energy use grey circles no improvement in any of the objectives or improvements that lead to violation of effluent limits in fig 5 for each marker in the legend green checks denote an improvement compared to the model baseline operations whereas red crosses represent a worsening with respect to the model baseline operations combinations of manual valves that improve in all criteria relative to baseline conditions were successfully identified white stars fig 5 however when trying to improve only two of the objectives the further reduction of these can be obtained by trading the third one for example if both water quality objectives need to be concurrently improved regardless of energy use higher overall effluent quality can be achieved compared to solutions that improve in all objectives on the other hand if priority is posed on the reduction of solely one objective thus trading the improvement of the other two an additional margin of reduction is established once the desired improvement in one or more objectives has been formulated the region of operation containing the solutions can then be selected a more comprehensive set of possible solutions are illustrated in the parallel plot shown in see appendix a 8 3 4 six options analysis six of the optimized manual valves combinations obtained from the 3 dimensional pareto plot were selected each of the selected options guarantees the compliance with the regulatory effluent limits these are option 1 minimization of monthly average nox option 2 minimization of maximum daily nh4 option 3 minimization of energy use option 4 minimization of monthly average nox and concurrent improvement in energy use compared to baseline conditions option 5 minimization of maximum daily nh4 and concurrent improvement in energy use compared to baseline conditions option 6 minimization of energy use and concurrent improvement for both effluent objectives compared to baseline conditions fig 6 illustrates the six selected options in the pareto space each one a projection of the pareto solutions on one of the three plains nh4 against energy a nox against energy b nh4 against nox c for each of the six options considered the bar plots show the percent change of the three objectives with respect to model baseline conditions red horizontal line shown in fig 6d e f where fig 6d is the percent change in energy consumption fig 6e shows the percent variation of monthly average nox concentrations and fig 6f showing the percent change of maximum daily nh4 in fig 6d the decrease in energy use ranged from 1 1 to 13 6 for options 3 4 5 6 with option 3 energy minimization providing the largest savings in energy use conversely an increase in energy use was observed for option 1 nox minimization 4 4 and 2 nh4 minimization 11 5 fig 6e shows that monthly average nox concentrations decreased when considering option 1 81 6 4 56 4 and 6 3 4 whereas options that did not prioritize nox resulted in an increase of the nox objective of 94 1 option 2 60 3 option 3 and 108 4 option 5 finally in fig 6f solutions that prioritize the nh4 objective resulted in an improved removal efficiency of 68 5 option 2 62 2 option 5 and 8 4 option 6 by instead selecting options 1 3 and 4 an increase in maximum daily nh4 concentrations of respectively 131 3 61 2 and 26 6 can be seen 3 5 operating costs monthly costs of the various options are shown for two different tariff structures older and newer in fig 7 a significant increase in operating costs is observed following the transition from the old tariff structure yellow dotted bars to the new tariff solid orange bars with an approximate 50 increase in costs throughout all options considered when considering the model baseline conditions approximately 94 200 usd mo 1 and 140 400 usd mo 1 in operational expenses are projected for one month based on the old and new tariff respectively by minimizing effluent nox option 1 an increase in monthly costs of around 4000 usd mo 1 and 5800 usd mo 1 is projected for the old and new tariffs respectively compared to the baseline system the highest increase in operating costs occurs by regulating manual valves with the intent of minimizing ammonium peaks option 2 with an increase of 10600 usd mo 1 and 15800 usd mo 1 for old and new tariffs respectively whereas the most cost effective scenario occurs when minimizing energy use option 3 a total reduction of 12800 usd mo 1 and 19000 usd mo 1 can then be expected when compared to the baseline system the minimization of nox with a concurrent improvement in energy use option 4 leads to a modest decrease in operating costs of 1000 usd mo 1 and 1400 usd mo 1 for old and new tariffs with respect to the baseline system similarly when minimizing nh4 while also improving in energy use option 5 a reduction of 2000 usd mo 1 and 3000 usd mo 1 could be achieved lastly by minimizing energy use while still ensuring improvements in all objectives costs reductions of 4800 usd mo 1 and 7200 usd mo 1 for old and new tariffs respectively are seen 3 6 optimized manual valve positions fig 8 shows the opening percent of the manual valve for each of the six considered options white bars compared to the baseline condition black bars the isolation valves such as valve z play an important role in balancing the airflow between different units higher openings of the z valve are seen for solutions that minimize nox option 1 and option 4 compared to solutions that minimize nh4 option 2 and 5 thus decreasing the airflow to units 1 2 and 3 and increasing it to units 4 and 5 the minimization of energy use option 3 results in a more closed position for the valve z thus prioritizing higher airflow rates in units 1 2 and 3 in addition the main distribution header valves a b c d e f g h i l used to distribute the airflow to the various passes display noticeable differences for the configurations that minimize each of the three objectives option 1 2 and 3 in particular the minimization of nox option 1 results in relatively higher openings of the valves serving the first 2 passes of each unit b c e g and i compared to valves serving the last two passes a d f h and l such configuration while maintaining high nitrification rates by increasing airflow in the first two passes also promotes denitrification in the last two passes by reducing airflow when minimizing nh4 option 2 valves serving the first 2 passes b c e g and i are less opened and valves serving the last two passes a d f h and l are relatively more opened compared to valves that minimize nox option 1 such combination provides a more balanced distribution of the airflow between the first two and last two passes which ensures the removal of influent ammonium as well as the ammonium produced through the ammonification process in the last reactor zones for valves combinations that minimize energy consumption option 3 main header valves b c e g and i serving the first 2 passes are more partially opened when compared to valves a d f h and l serving the last two passes this configuration results in the redistribution of airflow to zones with higher diffuser densities in the first two passes thus resulting in lower pressure loss per diffuser and thus lower overall system pressure 4 discussion 4 1 manual valves trade offs once a manual valve configuration has been fixed a trade off is established between ammonium nitrite nitrate and energy costs when compared to the 6 options considered the baseline condition provides a more conservative operation by prioritizing a balance between the three objectives among the options considered the selection of a set of manual valves that prioritizes the removal of either nh4 or nox is expected to result in an increase in energy use and operating expenses moreover the highest energy consumption is projected when prioritizing the abatement of effluent nh4 peaks since valve combinations that decrease the system s pressure are not prioritized by instead focusing on minimization of energy use and operating costs a simultaneous increase in both nh4 and nox is anticipated furthermore options that minimize the effluent quality while also improving energy use options 4 and 5 provide similar energy use but display significant differences in the effluent objectives hence showing that although different manual valve combinations may yield similar improvements in energy use these may establish diametrically different characteristics in the final effluent quality in particular as seen in fig 6c the nh4 and nox objectives are inversely proportional which is expected due to the mechanistic relationship between reactant nh4 and products nox of nitrification furthermore the selection of the valve combination that will result in the lowest energy use option 3 does not necessarily constitute the ideal choice even when assuring compliance with regulatory effluent standards the results deriving from a specific combination of manual valves should be studied in conjunction with downstream operations such as the disinfection step see appendix therefore if the improvement of a specific objective is required to further enhance the overall efficiency of downstream processes a specific tradeoff region may result more ideal than others that instead prioritize energy conservation 4 2 changes in energy tariff structures once the manual valves in the air supply system are set these are seldom changed with timescales that can range from months to years in the interim changes in the energy provider s tariff structure can significantly impact the operating costs even when energy usage remains the same therefore as shown in this study whenever a change to the tariff structure occurs an assessment of the current valve combination should be considered to determine if the committed trade offs between effluent quality and the costs savings are acceptable however even when the minimization of operating costs via manual valve adjustment is pursued the selection of such combination can only partially lower the energy bill of the utility this is because manual valves can only provide a passive control as they cannot be used to dynamically lower energy use and power demand during high peak hours for this reason the regulation of manual valve positions should in general be coupled with other strategies that aim at shifting the process intensity away from the peak hours when energy is the most expensive as advocated by previous studies aymerich et al 2015 emami et al 2018 leu et al 2009 this is likely to results in even higher overall cost savings 4 3 advantages and disadvantages of manual valve optimization compared to previous studies a multi objective optimization of manual valves allows to concurrently assess the performance of an air supply system for an ensemble of different objective criteria in particular water quality metrics used for effluent compliance provides a more realistic and practical target when compared to traditional optimization strategies in addition the inclusion of the energy tariff structure provides the additional advantage of integrating the financial aspect in the selection of the most suitable operating strategy of the air supply system furthermore this approach can be a useful tool for smaller facilities that are limited in terms of instrumentation and or qualified personnel that are required to operate a dynamic control structure with actuated valves however the optimization of a fixed manual valve configuration can only provide a static optimization meaning it cannot dynamically respond to changes of the influent characteristics even after optimization a fix manual valve configuration will be more susceptible to periodic effluent breakthroughs than a system with actuated valves therefore the implementation of traditional dynamic control structures will ultimately be better tailored to meet the daily variations in oxygen demand in each of the reactor zones 4 4 future research when considering manual valve optimization for air supply systems with both fixed and actuated valves the trade off between effluent quality and costs energy savings will also be dependent on the specific dynamic control structure employed moreover the incorporation of various blower control strategies will also influence the optimization of the fixed manual valves in the piping system for example when considering blower control strategy based on header pressure setpoint as a manual valve is opened to increase air flow to a zone the blower control loop would increase the discharged airflow to compensate for the decrease of the manifold s pressure which results in excess pressure above what is needed to supply air to the each of the reactor zones jenkins 2014 this ultimately would result in higher energy consumption and will therefore lead to different pareto solutions therefore as part of future studies the impact of prior manual valve optimization should be conducted for an ensemble of different aeration control structures results from such study would provide further insight on selection of the appropriate fix manual valve configuration based on the specific aeration control strategy adopted 5 conclusions this study shows for the first time the use of manual valve positions as parameters to conduct a multi objective optimization analysis of air supply systems with respect to effluent quality energy use and operating costs the key findings of this study are outlined in the following points nh4 nox and energy use were the most impacted by the various manual valve combinations eight regions showing different trade offs among the objectives considered were identified thus highlighting that during airflow regulation via manual valve adjustment a compromise is always committed between energy use nh4 and nox concentrations extreme pareto solutions showed a potential decrease of 13 6 in energy use 81 6 in monthly average nox and 68 5 in daily maximum nh4 the simultaneous improvement in all the three objectives relative to model baseline conditions is achievable although the marginal improvements of each objectives is less significant than more extreme solutions two different time of use energy tariff structures were considered an increase in operating costs of approximately 50 was observed for all options when considering a newer tariff over the older one the selection of a set of manual valves that minimizes either nh4 or nox is expected to increase overall operating costs monthly cost savings between 12800 usd mo 1 and 19000 usd mo 1 were achieved when adopting a manual valve combination that minimizes energy use the isolation and main header valves play an important role when optimizing fix manual valve positions and should therefore always be included in optimization analysis of air supply systems

18085,diffused aeration is the most implemented method for oxygen transfer in municipal activated sludge systems and governs the economics of the entire treatment process empirical observations are typically used to regulate airflow distribution through the adjustment of manual valves however due to the associated degrees of freedom the identification of a combination of manual valves that optimizes all performance criteria is a complex task for the first time a multi criteria optimization algorithm was used to minimize effluent constituents and energy use by parametrizing manual valves positions data from a full scale facility in conjunction with specific model assumptions were used to develop a base case facility consisting of a detailed air supply model a bio kinetic model and a clarification model compared to the base case condition trade offs analysis showed potential energy savings of up to 13 6 and improvement of effluent quality for nh4 up to 68 5 and nox up to 81 6 based on two different tariff structures of a local power utility maximum costs savings of 12800 usd mo 1 to 19000 usd mo 1 were estimated compared to baseline condition graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater aeration air valve multi objective pareto 1 introduction water resource recovery facilities wrrfs provide the important service of collecting treating and transforming the various contaminants present in municipal wastewaters however for these systems to properly function significant energy is required for onsite operations wef 2009 longo et al 2016 the required oxic conditions in the aerobic tanks for the degradation of pollutants are commonly achieved through sub surface diffused aeration diffused aeration has gained wide implementation since it guarantees higher oxygen transfer efficiency than other available methods groves et al 1992 rosso et al 2008 air needs to be pressurized by blowers and routed to the different reactor zones via a piping network in order for the air bubbles to be released from the diffusers blowers are required to overcome the hydrostatic pressure the frictional pressure losses of the piping system and the dynamic wet pressure of the diffusers due to the high power demand required for the blowers to operate diffused aeration is the most energy intensive process in wrrfs representing as much as 45 75 of the energy use olsson 2015 reardon 1995 rosso et al 2008 the growing emphasis towards energy footprint minimization coupled with the ever more stringent effluent discharge limits has propelled more research on the study of air supply systems rosso et al 2008 zhu and anderson 2017 since the advent of dynamic simulators for wastewater treatment the ability to analyze different operational strategies in a non invasive manner has improved significantly gernaey et al 2004 many control strategies have been implemented in several simulation environments to study the optimization of diffused aeration systems åmand et al 2013 control structures based on dissolved oxygen do set points ekman et al 2006 and ammonia based aeration control abac rieger et al 2014 2012 uprety et al 2016 are well known and have been applied to achieve improved effluent quality in addition other control schemes such as most open valve mov are used to lower pressure drop thus reducing blower power demand by setting the valve with the highest percent opening to a defined value typically between 85 and 95 jens et al 2016 vreč ko et al 2014 regardless of the specific control structure considered valve stem positions are among the main manipulated variables used in control systems to improve aeration treatment performance jenkins 2014 however detailed models of actual equipment components such as diffusers blowers pipes and valves have only been marginally implemented in simulation studies of air supply systems juan garcía et al 2018 in fact the vast majority of dynamic simulation studies completed thus far assumes an ideal continuous supply of airflow capable of matching demand requirements thus neglecting the physical and operational limitations of the air delivery components ingildsen et al 2002 zhu and anderson 2017 the operating boundaries of aeration equipment such as blower turndown and maximum diffuser pressure drop are critical for a realistic description of dynamic control strategies amaral et al 2017 in fact the simulation of control strategies that do not explicitly account for equipment specifications may limit accurate model prediction or even conceal the applicability of the control action itself juan garcía et al 2018 it has been only in recent years that process models have moved from ideal air supply to ad hoc equipment models the first reported attempt to develop a detailed model of air supply systems in wrrfs can be found in jens et al 2002 in that work the airflow in the network of pipes is modeled as a repeating sequence of storage volumes and resistances the inlet and outlet pressure of the storage volumes is used to calculate the mass flow rates between them a subsequent integrated model was proposed in schraa et al 2017 which includes a more detailed representation of site specific equipment such as blowers valves and diffusers this has allowed describing more realistically the interactions occurring between the aeration system oxygen supply side the biological reactors oxygen demand side and the control system more recently the work from juan garcía et al 2018 shows the use of a detailed air supply system model for the comparative analysis of various energy optimization strategies for a 55 000 m3 d 1 14 5 mgd capacity facility however even the most recent and advanced studies are conducted without a prior selection of an optimal set of manual valves these differently from the throttled valves used for dynamic control are seldom adjusted and are used to ensure a correct distribution of the airflow to the various aerated zones it is common praxis for manual valves to be adjusted empirically through a trial and error approach without fully considering the trade offs occurring between the effluent water quality constituents and the energy use juan garcía et al 2018 in fact any adjustment to the openings of a set of manual valves will establish different airflow distribution as well as pressure drop across the piping network which can affect both effluent quality and power demand respectively conflicting objectives such as achieving low effluent concentrations bod5 nh4 etc while also reducing operating costs hakanen et al 2013 are a commonly encountered challenge among facility operators the analysis of the trade offs that occur for different combinations of manual valves can be done by implementing a multi objective optimization algorithm also known as multi criteria multi objective optimization algorithms allow to find a set of pareto optimal solutions also known as pareto front each solution represents a point in a n dimensional space having as coordinates the values of the n objectives deb 2001 each solution located on the pareto front is considered non dominated meaning that each one represents the best option given a specific set of criteria i e they cannot achieve further improvements in terms of any one objective unless at the expense of another several examples of multi objective optimization analysis are found in wastewater treatment applications such as pi controller coefficients sweetapple et al 2014 hydraulic retention time sludge retention time internal recirculation zhang et al 2014 airflow rates sludge wastage and recirculated activated sludge hreiz et al 2015 however a systematic multi objective optimization of water quality and energy use of air supply systems by varying manual valves was heretofore missing the goal of this study is to demonstrate the impacts that different combinations of manual valve openings have on energy use costs and effluent quality by using an advanced air supply system model moreover a multi objective optimization analysis is applied for the first time by using manual valve positions as parameters to minimize effluent concentrations and energy use data from a facility combined with model assumptions were used to develop a base case scenario configuration of a secondary treatment which was then compared to the optimized pareto solutions a total of 5 objective functions were investigated energy use maximum daily nh4 concentration maximum daily bod5 concentrations maximum daily tss concentrations and monthly average nox concentrations a trade off analysis is then conducted for the objectives that are most sensitive to the various optimal manual valve combinations 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant layout and operation the facility that was considered for the case study is located in the southwestern united states characterized by arid to semi arid climate the plant receives an average of 1 7 105 m3 day 1 or approximately 45 mgd of municipal sewage from a separate sewer network the biological compartment is operated in step feed mode a total of 5 parallel units see fig 1 are configured for biological nutrient removal bnr no supplement carbon is added originally the plant was designed and constructed with 3 parallel lines stage 1 two additional units identical to the existing ones were subsequently added stage 2 each unit is comprised of 4 passes in series each divided in 3 grids an anoxic oxic oxic sequence is used for the first two passes an anoxic swing oxic for the third and an oxic oxic oxic for the fourth the three step feed gates are situated at the beginning of the anoxic grids excess sludge is wasted from the recirculating activated sludge ras line and discharged back to the sewer system for subsequent downstream processing by a centralized plant in this study the wrrf had to meet the following local regulatory discharge limits for a nearby river maximum daily bod5 45 mg l 1 maximum daily tss 45 mg l 1 maximum daily ammonium 6 mg l 1 and monthly average nox 8 mg l 1 the blower house contains five centrifugal blowers three 1300 kw 1750 hp each and two 670 kw 900 hp air from the blowers is routed to a main manifold from which is then distributed to 10 headers each header serves 2 adjacent passes for each of the 5 units a total of 71 valves are used to adjust or isolate the airflow in the piping network 10 valves for each header 60 valves for each drop leg and 1 valve between stage 1 from stage 2 the aeration system was initially constructed with manual valves and was later complemented with some automatic valves despite this combination of manual and automatic valves during the optimization phase the valves were assumed to be all fixed as in their initial configuration this assumption stems from the decision to consider the potential benefits and trade offs that can be achieved by optimizing fixed manual valves positions prior to the implementation of a dynamic valve control system such a valve configuration although not ideal is still a commonly encountered condition in many activated sludge processes in wrrfs around the world guerrero et al 2011 ma et al 2010 qiu et al 2010 air delivery is achieved through the implementation of ceramic disc diffusers 9 inches 230 mm in diameter airflow is provided based on an open loop time based control system 2 2 modeling framework and boundaries the framework of the study is based on the most recent protocols hsg guideline and gmp unified protocol for modeling wastewater treatment processes langergraber et al 2004 rieger et al 2013 for the specific case of optimization of air supply systems a more detailed flow chart is provided in figure a2 see appendix the flow chart outlines the various analytical steps to use when optimizing existing air supply systems the model boundary contains the entire secondary treatment process the scope of the study encompasses the optimization analysis for an air supply system that adopts fix manual valves as a mean to regulate airflow distribution without considering control structures of dynamically actuated valves to achieve the goal of the study equipment sub models are included for a more realistic description of air re distribution and pressure drop across the piping network which ultimately affects local oxygen transfer rates and overall power demand data collected from a full scale facility was used to set up a detailed model version of the air supply system and to perform the calibration and validation of the air supply system model tank size and process configuration were retrieved from facility s blueprints due to limited effluent data available the biokinetic and settling parameters are based on default literature values implemented in previous studies aymerich et al 2015 santín et al 2015 therefore the detailed air supply model along with the biokinetic and clarifier model are used to develop a baseline model that is then compared to the various optimized scenarios this study focuses on the concurrent optimization of energy use and various water quality constituents tss bod5 nh4 nox this is achieved by searching for the optimal manual valve combinations operating costs were estimated by implementing two local tariff structures in the integrated model to generalize the applicability of the study costs were not included in the objective functions since they can be influenced by the specific geographic location such as the energy tariff structure that a utility is enrolled in in addition for an optimization analysis of manual valves that consider a tariff structure based on the user s energy use and or peak power demand charge the selection of either energy or costs does not influence the relative ranking in performance of each of the manual valve combinations 2 3 field data acquisition and pre processing regular site inspections were conducted to assess the current plant layout and evaluate the operating status of the modeled equipment blueprints of the aeration system were obtained from plant engineers and were used for the development of a detailed aeration model specifications of the reactor tanks and clarifiers were incorporated in the reactor and clarifier models step feed flow ratios used in the model were retrieved from on site flow monitoring daily average split ratios values were used in the model although it is known that flow split ratios can vary as the function of influent flow rates patel et al 2008 flow splits are assumed to not change over time operational variables such as valve positions airflow measurements and blower operating schedule were obtained during the field visits valve positions that were inaccessible at the time of plant visits were assumed in the model to be fully open specifications of equipment such as blower curves valve curves and diffuser curves were retrieved from the respective equipment manufacturers see appendix due to the relatively high dynamics of variables such as airflow and pressure in air supply systems a 10 min sampling rate is used for model inputs and outputs more details are provided in table 1 for both inputs and outputs used during model calibration and validation whenever data values were missing or fragmented a signal reconstruction algorithm was employed firstly noise smoothing and outlier removal using a moving mean with 2 sigma criterion is performed followed by the processing and exclusion of signal artifacts such as the automatic linear interpolation across missing data points after an initialization phase tin 100 d for the achievement of steady state conditions dynamic simulations were run over a 14 day period diurnal influent profiles of ammonium and flowrate were used as model inputs two hourly measurements of dynamic alpha factors were used to account for the diurnal variability in oxygen transfer efficiency see appendix daily measurements of primary effluent constituents obtained from grab samples were used for the characterization and generation of the secondary influent constituents profiles devisscher et al 2006 martin and vanrolleghem 2014 2 4 model structure 2 4 1 secondary treatment process model various sub models were adopted to simulate the dynamic response of the bio reactors clarifiers and air supply system the model equations were implemented in the simulink platform from mathworks by using customizable diagram blocks see appendix the main biological processes occurring in the activated sludge tanks are modeled using the asm1 structure henze et al 1987 van loosdrecht et al 2015 the asm1 model was deemed appropriate due to the study s specific modeling objectives and also the absence of large anaerobic anoxic zones which would have otherwise precluded its selection in favor of other bio kinetic models langergraber et al 2004 wet weather events occur sporadically in the region under study hence it is relatively easy to collect a continuous dataset of hydraulic and suspended solids load the secondary settling tanks have been modeled using a spatially discretized layered clarifier model that accounts for concentration driven settling behavior takács et al 1991 the air supply distribution was modeled similarly to other studies with equipment components such as the blower battery piping system valves and diffusers amaral et al 2017 juan garcía et al 2018 schraa et al 2017 as thoroughly presented in schraa et al 2015 and schraa et al 2017 the air supply system equipment sub models are linked together by using physical gas models block diagrams which although use a different simulation environment are based on the same physical equations however specific equipment curves such as blowers diffusers and valves were alternatively modeled by implementing directly the manufacturer curves into the simulink model by using a 2 d look up table block in this study a time based open loop blower control with inlet guide vanes is used to maintain preconfigured diurnal profiles of dynamic airflow rates regardless of pressure differential pipe elements comprising the air distribution system were modeled by implementing the pre configured blocks available in the gas system library of the simscape toolbox from mathworks similarly valves were modeled by using the variable local restriction block from simscape diffusers were modeled by using a localized flow resistance block which was calibrated using the manufacturer dynamic wet pressure dwp curves in addition sote curves from the diffuser manufacturer were implemented using 2 d look up table blocks table 2 provides a list of specifications for the different aeration components that were modeled including the type of data collected from the equipment manufacturers the inclusion of flow restrictions diffusers and valves is attained by modeling them as localized pressure drops in the simscape environment the contribution of the diffuser s control orifices to the overall pressure loss has been often overlooked in previous optimization studies of air supply systems due to their quadratic response to changes in airflow rate the pressure drop of control orifices will become significant at higher airflow rates in fact for higher diffuser airflow rates 3 4 scfm diffuser 1 orifice headlosses of disc diffusers are 3 6 times higher than the dwp epa 1989 as such diffuser s orifice contribution to the overall pressure drop should always be included in models of air supply systems since the orifices pressure loss curves were not readily available the local aggregate pressure loss of the pipes serving the diffusers was parametrized in order to simulate the orifice pressure drop however the parametrization of orifice pressure drops during the calibration phase together with the distributed losses of the piping system can lead to an underestimation of the actual orifice pressure losses since their contribution might be averaged out across the rest of the distribution system when valve flow coefficient curves cv kv curves are available redistribution of air mass flow rates can be estimated as a function of valve stem opening schraa et al 2015 skousen 1998 in this study the cv curves are used to estimate the pressure drop as a result of different valve openings the model used here thus allows capturing the redistribution of air between parallel units as a result of pressure rise due to partial valve closing modeling changes in airflow distribution grants the possibility to track changes of oxygen transfer rates otrs across different zones which ultimately impacts dissolved oxygen levels for further information regarding the simscape model blocks used in the air supply model the reader is referred to the online mathworks documentation on gas models 2 4 2 tariff structure the importance of improving model predictions with structured energy tariffs was discussed previously by aymerich et al 2015 and amerlinck et al 2016 compared to previous simulation studies of air supply system the herein study also incorporates different energy tariff structures in order to account for the aeration operating costs due to the complexity of the actual tariff structure of the facility under study i e energy purchase from retail markets based on day ahead and real time energy markets operating costs were instead estimated based on the main local energy provider time of use tou structures the introduction of renewable energy sources in the region under study has led the main local energy provider to change the tou structure in order to include the costs implications that derive when implementing different tariff structures both the previous and newer local energy tariff structures were considered in this study see fig 2 summer tariffs were selected to match the season of field data collection the total costs linked to the electricity use was obtained for each of the two tariffs structures by summing the delivery costs and the generation costs in addition power demand charges were included in the final cost estimations for each of the two tariffs see appendix the old tariff presented a power demand charge of 6 56 usd kw 1 whereas the new one is of 5 08 usd kw 1 both old and new tariffs are typical of large service contracts i e 50 kv in fig 2 charts a and b report the tariff structure prior to the switch for both weekdays and weekends respectively similarly charts c and d show the new tariffs for both weekdays and weekends the old tariff is characterized by three tiers during the weekdays off peak mid peak and on peak and a single constant off peak tier during weekends the newest tariff instead uses a two tier structure during both weekdays off peak on peak and weekends off peak mid peak for more details on energy tariff structures in wrrfs more information can be retrieved in aymerich et al 2015 2 5 model calibration and validation analogously to the work presented in amerlinck et al 2016 model calibration and validation was partitioned in two stages at first the calibration validation of the equipment sub models such as blowers valves and diffusers was conducted by using manufacturer data sheets manufacturer curves of valves flow coefficient cv and diffusers dwp and sote were implemented by an approximate two dimensional function block from simulink the prior calibration of the equipment sub models allows to mitigate the propagation of parameter uncertainties while also reducing the number parameters used in the integrated model physical parameters such as pipe diameters pipe lengths and manual valve positions were obtained from the facility blueprints and through direct field readings secondly a calibration and validation of the complete air supply system was performed previous studies have used various measurements for the calibration of the air supply system such as blower power amerlinck et al 2016 pressure discharge and airflow rate juan garcía et al 2018 in this study the calibration of the overall air supply system was performed by using the measurements of pressure discharge and power demand from the blowers as also mentioned in schraa et al 2017 the main parameters used to calibrate the overall air supply system were aggregate local resistances for the pipes serving the diffusers and local resistances for the main header lines in addition since the blower efficiency curves were not retrievable the parameters used to calculate the efficiency curve of the blowers were also included in the global calibration of the air supply system the calibration and validation of the air supply system was conducted by using power and pressure profiles of blower 1 2 and 5 data from blower 3 was partly fragmented for the period considered and thus was not used for either the calibration or validation stage data from blower 4 could only be used during the calibration phase but not during validation since for that period the blower underwent duty rotation with blower 5 this is clearly visible in fig 3 b where the power demand of blower 4 drops and is followed by the powering on of blower 5 the first 7 days of the data set were used for calibration whereas the subsequent 7 days were used for validation following validation the model displays good predictive capabilities as seen in fig 3 around day 6 the predicted values for pressure of blower 2 diverge from actual measurements this was due to a temporary maintenance event during which the blower was offline in addition the pressure peaks for both day 2 and day 5 are overestimated the reason behind these concurrent overpredicted pressure peaks for both blower 1 and blower 2 is likely to be attributed to epistemic model uncertainty 2 6 multi objective optimization 2 6 1 optimization algorithm local optimization algorithms provide an efficient method for finding local optima within a convex parameter space however local optimizers can lead to suboptimal solutions for complex optimization problems with many local optima and a nonlinear parameter space for nonlinear optimization studies of wrrfs genetic algorithms have proven to be a more robust method for the search of the global optimum the ability of genetic algorithms to efficiently search intractably large nonlinear parameters spaces has led to their use in recent optimization studies of wastewater treatment plants de faria et al 2016 fang et al 2011 guerrero et al 2011 hreiz et al 2015 sweetapple et al 2014 several of these studies rely on a single biological model for natural selection and adaptation which presumes that a single evolutionary method exists that efficiently evolves a population of potential solutions through the parameter space however existing theory and numerical experiments have shown that it is impossible to develop a single evolutionary algorithm that is consistently efficient for a different set of optimization problems rahnamay naeini et al 2018 vrugt and robinson 2007 multi algorithm genetic search methods have been shown to provide greater robustness and applicability across different optimization problems when compared to single meta heuristic search algorithms vrugt and robinson 2007 therefore due to the high dimensionality and nonlinearity of valve optimization problems åmand et al 2013 the selection of the shuffled complex self adaptive hybrid evolution sc sahel algorithm rahnamay naeini et al 2018 was favored over local optimizers and other single evolutionary search methods the sc sahel algorithm was used for both model calibration and optimization of the multiple objectives for more details on the optimization method used the reader is referred to the appendix 2 6 2 optimization parameters and objectives all the manual valves are parametrized and used for the generation of a population of different sets of manual valve combinations while all of the dynamic input profiles see table 1 are maintained unaltered this population is then partitioned in different complexes that evolve in parallel during the multi objective optimization search a total of five objective functions have been selected daily maximum tss daily maximum bod5 daily maximum nh4 monthly average nox and energy use the objectives were calculated for each simulation by means of the following equations 1 of n h 4 max n h 4 e f f t 1 n h 4 e f f t 1 δ t n h 4 e f f τ 2 of n h 4 max n h 4 e f f t 1 n h 4 e f f t 1 δ t n h 4 e f f τ 3 of t s s max t s s e

simulation time conversely from other studies that use aggregate performance indexes the water quality objectives were selected based on generic regional regulatory standards the adoption of effluent quality metrics for the definition of the objective functions provides a more realistic and practical target since it reflects regional regulatory standards which are ultimately in line with the goals of the municipal wastewater treatment utility 3 results 3 1 pareto fronts and objectives sensitivity from the multi objective optimization phase the set of pareto solutions are retrieved each one corresponding to a different combination of manual valve positions each pareto solution exists in a 5 dimensional space for which the coordinates represent a specific value of each of the different objectives considered appendix a 7 daily maximum tss daily maximum bod5 daily maximum nh4 monthly average nox and energy use the non dominated solutions pareto front represent the points performing equally well in every objective and better in at least one relative to all other points the sensitivity of each objective to the set of optimized manual valve combinations was measured by their coefficient of variation cv which is a standardized method used to measure and compare the dispersion of different frequency distributions the cv is defined as the ratio between the standard deviation sigma and the mean of a population cv σ μ among the 423 pareto solutions nh4 nox and energy use resulted the most impacted by the different possible combinations of valve stem positions cv values of 0 43 0 35 and 0 12 respectively lower sensitivities are instead seen for bod5 and tss having a coefficient of variation of 10 2 and 2 10 3 respectively 3 2 extreme pareto solutions due to the relatively low sensitivity of effluent bod5 and tss the pareto analysis was focused exclusively on the three most sensitive effluent objectives nh4 nox and energy use fig 4 highlights three points representing the extreme pareto solutions each of these solutions is generated by a specific valve combination which establishes the lowest possible value for either nh4 nox or energy use a square symbol was used to identify the solution linked to the valve combination yielding the lowest daily maximum ammonium concentration as seen in fig 4a this solution is expected to produce an effluent with a maximum ammonium concentration of 0 75 mgnh4 l 1 68 5 than baseline conditions with an energy consumption of 698 6 mwh 11 5 than baseline conditions from fig 4b the same square solution results in a monthly average nox concentration of 7 24 mgnox l 1 94 1 more than baseline conditions on the other hand a circle symbol is used to denote the solution yielding the lowest value for nox which is expected to yield a monthly average nox effluent concentration of 0 69 mgnox l 1 81 6 than baseline condition fig 4b the same solution also projects an energy consumption of 653 6 mwh 4 4 than baseline conditions and maximum ammonium concentration of 5 54 mgnh4 l 1 131 3 more than baseline conditions fig 4a it can be noted that even if the square and circle solutions provide the lowest value for either one of the water quality objectives they will not benefit the effluent concentration of the other objective the solution that ensures the minimum energy use 542 1 mwh 13 6 less than baseline conditions is marked by a triangle which results in a detrimental increase of both the effluent objectives 3 85 mgnh4 l 1 and 5 98 mgnoxl 1 61 2 and 60 3 increase hence although each of the extreme solutions provides the lowest values for each of the three objectives it does so by increasing the others 3 3 trade off analysis of pareto regions of operation a comprehensive analysis on the trade offs between the three objectives is presented in the following section the effluent regulatory limits and the model baseline are used as a constraint for classifying the various non dominated solutions based on this classification a total of eight regions of operation are identified as shown in fig 5 solutions contained in each region display different trade offs between nh4 nox and energy use while still ensuring compliance with effluent limits different markers are used to identify each solution white stars improvement in all criteria orange circles improvement in nh4 and energy use but not nox orange squares improvement in nox and energy use but not nh4 violet crosses improvement in nox and nh4 but not energy use blue circles improvement in only nh4 blue squares improvement in only nox yellow triangles improvement in only energy use grey circles no improvement in any of the objectives or improvements that lead to violation of effluent limits in fig 5 for each marker in the legend green checks denote an improvement compared to the model baseline operations whereas red crosses represent a worsening with respect to the model baseline operations combinations of manual valves that improve in all criteria relative to baseline conditions were successfully identified white stars fig 5 however when trying to improve only two of the objectives the further reduction of these can be obtained by trading the third one for example if both water quality objectives need to be concurrently improved regardless of energy use higher overall effluent quality can be achieved compared to solutions that improve in all objectives on the other hand if priority is posed on the reduction of solely one objective thus trading the improvement of the other two an additional margin of reduction is established once the desired improvement in one or more objectives has been formulated the region of operation containing the solutions can then be selected a more comprehensive set of possible solutions are illustrated in the parallel plot shown in see appendix a 8 3 4 six options analysis six of the optimized manual valves combinations obtained from the 3 dimensional pareto plot were selected each of the selected options guarantees the compliance with the regulatory effluent limits these are option 1 minimization of monthly average nox option 2 minimization of maximum daily nh4 option 3 minimization of energy use option 4 minimization of monthly average nox and concurrent improvement in energy use compared to baseline conditions option 5 minimization of maximum daily nh4 and concurrent improvement in energy use compared to baseline conditions option 6 minimization of energy use and concurrent improvement for both effluent objectives compared to baseline conditions fig 6 illustrates the six selected options in the pareto space each one a projection of the pareto solutions on one of the three plains nh4 against energy a nox against energy b nh4 against nox c for each of the six options considered the bar plots show the percent change of the three objectives with respect to model baseline conditions red horizontal line shown in fig 6d e f where fig 6d is the percent change in energy consumption fig 6e shows the percent variation of monthly average nox concentrations and fig 6f showing the percent change of maximum daily nh4 in fig 6d the decrease in energy use ranged from 1 1 to 13 6 for options 3 4 5 6 with option 3 energy minimization providing the largest savings in energy use conversely an increase in energy use was observed for option 1 nox minimization 4 4 and 2 nh4 minimization 11 5 fig 6e shows that monthly average nox concentrations decreased when considering option 1 81 6 4 56 4 and 6 3 4 whereas options that did not prioritize nox resulted in an increase of the nox objective of 94 1 option 2 60 3 option 3 and 108 4 option 5 finally in fig 6f solutions that prioritize the nh4 objective resulted in an improved removal efficiency of 68 5 option 2 62 2 option 5 and 8 4 option 6 by instead selecting options 1 3 and 4 an increase in maximum daily nh4 concentrations of respectively 131 3 61 2 and 26 6 can be seen 3 5 operating costs monthly costs of the various options are shown for two different tariff structures older and newer in fig 7 a significant increase in operating costs is observed following the transition from the old tariff structure yellow dotted bars to the new tariff solid orange bars with an approximate 50 increase in costs throughout all options considered when considering the model baseline conditions approximately 94 200 usd mo 1 and 140 400 usd mo 1 in operational expenses are projected for one month based on the old and new tariff respectively by minimizing effluent nox option 1 an increase in monthly costs of around 4000 usd mo 1 and 5800 usd mo 1 is projected for the old and new tariffs respectively compared to the baseline system the highest increase in operating costs occurs by regulating manual valves with the intent of minimizing ammonium peaks option 2 with an increase of 10600 usd mo 1 and 15800 usd mo 1 for old and new tariffs respectively whereas the most cost effective scenario occurs when minimizing energy use option 3 a total reduction of 12800 usd mo 1 and 19000 usd mo 1 can then be expected when compared to the baseline system the minimization of nox with a concurrent improvement in energy use option 4 leads to a modest decrease in operating costs of 1000 usd mo 1 and 1400 usd mo 1 for old and new tariffs with respect to the baseline system similarly when minimizing nh4 while also improving in energy use option 5 a reduction of 2000 usd mo 1 and 3000 usd mo 1 could be achieved lastly by minimizing energy use while still ensuring improvements in all objectives costs reductions of 4800 usd mo 1 and 7200 usd mo 1 for old and new tariffs respectively are seen 3 6 optimized manual valve positions fig 8 shows the opening percent of the manual valve for each of the six considered options white bars compared to the baseline condition black bars the isolation valves such as valve z play an important role in balancing the airflow between different units higher openings of the z valve are seen for solutions that minimize nox option 1 and option 4 compared to solutions that minimize nh4 option 2 and 5 thus decreasing the airflow to units 1 2 and 3 and increasing it to units 4 and 5 the minimization of energy use option 3 results in a more closed position for the valve z thus prioritizing higher airflow rates in units 1 2 and 3 in addition the main distribution header valves a b c d e f g h i l used to distribute the airflow to the various passes display noticeable differences for the configurations that minimize each of the three objectives option 1 2 and 3 in particular the minimization of nox option 1 results in relatively higher openings of the valves serving the first 2 passes of each unit b c e g and i compared to valves serving the last two passes a d f h and l such configuration while maintaining high nitrification rates by increasing airflow in the first two passes also promotes denitrification in the last two passes by reducing airflow when minimizing nh4 option 2 valves serving the first 2 passes b c e g and i are less opened and valves serving the last two passes a d f h and l are relatively more opened compared to valves that minimize nox option 1 such combination provides a more balanced distribution of the airflow between the first two and last two passes which ensures the removal of influent ammonium as well as the ammonium produced through the ammonification process in the last reactor zones for valves combinations that minimize energy consumption option 3 main header valves b c e g and i serving the first 2 passes are more partially opened when compared to valves a d f h and l serving the last two passes this configuration results in the redistribution of airflow to zones with higher diffuser densities in the first two passes thus resulting in lower pressure loss per diffuser and thus lower overall system pressure 4 discussion 4 1 manual valves trade offs once a manual valve configuration has been fixed a trade off is established between ammonium nitrite nitrate and energy costs when compared to the 6 options considered the baseline condition provides a more conservative operation by prioritizing a balance between the three objectives among the options considered the selection of a set of manual valves that prioritizes the removal of either nh4 or nox is expected to result in an increase in energy use and operating expenses moreover the highest energy consumption is projected when prioritizing the abatement of effluent nh4 peaks since valve combinations that decrease the system s pressure are not prioritized by instead focusing on minimization of energy use and operating costs a simultaneous increase in both nh4 and nox is anticipated furthermore options that minimize the effluent quality while also improving energy use options 4 and 5 provide similar energy use but display significant differences in the effluent objectives hence showing that although different manual valve combinations may yield similar improvements in energy use these may establish diametrically different characteristics in the final effluent quality in particular as seen in fig 6c the nh4 and nox objectives are inversely proportional which is expected due to the mechanistic relationship between reactant nh4 and products nox of nitrification furthermore the selection of the valve combination that will result in the lowest energy use option 3 does not necessarily constitute the ideal choice even when assuring compliance with regulatory effluent standards the results deriving from a specific combination of manual valves should be studied in conjunction with downstream operations such as the disinfection step see appendix therefore if the improvement of a specific objective is required to further enhance the overall efficiency of downstream processes a specific tradeoff region may result more ideal than others that instead prioritize energy conservation 4 2 changes in energy tariff structures once the manual valves in the air supply system are set these are seldom changed with timescales that can range from months to years in the interim changes in the energy provider s tariff structure can significantly impact the operating costs even when energy usage remains the same therefore as shown in this study whenever a change to the tariff structure occurs an assessment of the current valve combination should be considered to determine if the committed trade offs between effluent quality and the costs savings are acceptable however even when the minimization of operating costs via manual valve adjustment is pursued the selection of such combination can only partially lower the energy bill of the utility this is because manual valves can only provide a passive control as they cannot be used to dynamically lower energy use and power demand during high peak hours for this reason the regulation of manual valve positions should in general be coupled with other strategies that aim at shifting the process intensity away from the peak hours when energy is the most expensive as advocated by previous studies aymerich et al 2015 emami et al 2018 leu et al 2009 this is likely to results in even higher overall cost savings 4 3 advantages and disadvantages of manual valve optimization compared to previous studies a multi objective optimization of manual valves allows to concurrently assess the performance of an air supply system for an ensemble of different objective criteria in particular water quality metrics used for effluent compliance provides a more realistic and practical target when compared to traditional optimization strategies in addition the inclusion of the energy tariff structure provides the additional advantage of integrating the financial aspect in the selection of the most suitable operating strategy of the air supply system furthermore this approach can be a useful tool for smaller facilities that are limited in terms of instrumentation and or qualified personnel that are required to operate a dynamic control structure with actuated valves however the optimization of a fixed manual valve configuration can only provide a static optimization meaning it cannot dynamically respond to changes of the influent characteristics even after optimization a fix manual valve configuration will be more susceptible to periodic effluent breakthroughs than a system with actuated valves therefore the implementation of traditional dynamic control structures will ultimately be better tailored to meet the daily variations in oxygen demand in each of the reactor zones 4 4 future research when considering manual valve optimization for air supply systems with both fixed and actuated valves the trade off between effluent quality and costs energy savings will also be dependent on the specific dynamic control structure employed moreover the incorporation of various blower control strategies will also influence the optimization of the fixed manual valves in the piping system for example when considering blower control strategy based on header pressure setpoint as a manual valve is opened to increase air flow to a zone the blower control loop would increase the discharged airflow to compensate for the decrease of the manifold s pressure which results in excess pressure above what is needed to supply air to the each of the reactor zones jenkins 2014 this ultimately would result in higher energy consumption and will therefore lead to different pareto solutions therefore as part of future studies the impact of prior manual valve optimization should be conducted for an ensemble of different aeration control structures results from such study would provide further insight on selection of the appropriate fix manual valve configuration based on the specific aeration control strategy adopted 5 conclusions this study shows for the first time the use of manual valve positions as parameters to conduct a multi objective optimization analysis of air supply systems with respect to effluent quality energy use and operating costs the key findings of this study are outlined in the following points nh4 nox and energy use were the most impacted by the various manual valve combinations eight regions showing different trade offs among the objectives considered were identified thus highlighting that during airflow regulation via manual valve adjustment a compromise is always committed between energy use nh4 and nox concentrations extreme pareto solutions showed a potential decrease of 13 6 in energy use 81 6 in monthly average nox and 68 5 in daily maximum nh4 the simultaneous improvement in all the three objectives relative to model baseline conditions is achievable although the marginal improvements of each objectives is less significant than more extreme solutions two different time of use energy tariff structures were considered an increase in operating costs of approximately 50 was observed for all options when considering a newer tariff over the older one the selection of a set of manual valves that minimizes either nh4 or nox is expected to increase overall operating costs monthly cost savings between 12800 usd mo 1 and 19000 usd mo 1 were achieved when adopting a manual valve combination that minimizes energy use the isolation and main header valves play an important role when optimizing fix manual valve positions and should therefore always be included in optimization analysis of air supply systems

18086,light energy is one of the major costs for phototrophic systems this study evaluated the photoreactor efficiency of purple phototropic bacteria anaerobic membrane bioreactor panmbr at low irradiance for the treatment of municipal wastewater infrared irradiance levels of 3 0 and 1 4 w m2 produced by an infrared ir lamp emitting in the 800 900 nm wavelength range were investigated with the ultimate goal of optimizing the irradiance energy demand experimental and modeling results demonstrated the ability of ppb to grow and treat raw municipal wastewater at the applied low irradiances with effluent quality below target limits of tcod 50 mg l tn 10 mg l and tp 1 mg l while monod kinetic parameters km and y were determined to be lower than previous high energy studies 1 9 mgcod mgvss d and 0 38 mgvss mgcod respectively the photobioreactor performance were consistently maintained indicating that energy cost associated with ir illumination can be reduced by up to 97 to determine whether the treatment process could approach energy neutrality subsequent anaerobic digestion experiments of the residual ppb biomass proved a potential for biogas recovery of up to 240 nmlch4 gvssadded and a moderate biomass biodegradability of 41 as a result the net energy consumption of the process was estimated at 0 5 kwh m3 of treated municipal wastewater considering an energy demand for illumination of 0 67 kwh m3 and an energy recovery attributed to the anaerobic digestion of 0 17 kwh m3 from the excess ppb biomass wasted from panmbr keywords purple phototrophic bacteria municipal wastewater low irradiance monod kinetics 1 introduction ppb have shown to have potential in applications such as municipal and industrial wastewater treatment due to the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia through assimilation azad et al 2001 phosphorous uptake by polyphosphate poly p formation hiraishi et al 1991 as well as nitrate removal through denitrification kim et al 2004 long term operation of a laboratory scale membrane photobioreactor at an infrared ir light irradiance of 50 w m2 indicated that high simultaneous removal of chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen n and phosphorous p from municipal wastewater 80 were achieved at temperatures of 22 c and 11 c hülsen et al 2016 dalaei et al 2019 the estimated energy consumption of 24 kwh m3 of reactor volume in dalaei at al 2019 is based on the ir irradiance of 50w m2 and the illuminated surface to volume ratio of 20 m2 m3 the aforementioned high energy consumption is a major concern for the application of ppb in municipal wastewater treatment industry only a few batch literature studies evaluated ppb performance at irradiances of below 50 w m2 moreover studies at irradiances of below 50 w m2 were carried out using pure ppb cultures and synthetic wastewater kim et al 2004 zhou et al 2014 prasertsan et al 1993 prasertsan et al 1993 indicated that the optimum light irradiance for the growth of rhodocyclus gelatinosus ppb stain and cod removal from diluted tuna condensate wastewater was 48 w m2 using batch cultivation tests at 30 c a series of batch tests were conducted by kim et al 2004 to evaluate organic acid removal from swine wastewater by a ppb strain rhodopseudomonas palustris at different light irradiances ranging from 8 to 80 w m2 to achieve the optimal light irradiance according to the aforementioned authors the optimum light irradiance of 64 w m2 was achieved with an overall organic acid acetic acid propionic acid isobutyric acid butyric acid isovaleric acid valeric acid and caproic acid removal efficiency of 83 however ir irradiance was reduced to 8 w m2 the organic acid removal efficiency by ppb was low 20 zhou et al 2014 demonstrated that the optimum light irradiance for ppb biomass production and cod removal from synthetic wastewater containing cod nh4 n and tp concentrations of 6000 400 and 90 mg l respectively was 32 w m2 the aforementioned study used a series of batch tests at different light irradiances of 500 1000 2000 4000 and 8000 lux equivalent to 8 16 32 64 and 128 w m2 irradiances were calculated using a conversion factor of 1 lux 0 0161028 w m2 based on vasiliadou et al 2018 it was noted that the cod removal efficiency decreased with higher ir irradiances higher than 80 w m2 due to photo inhibition zhang et al 2014 the full spectrum irradiance is known to also affect the synthesis of light harvesting pigments such as bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid produced by ppb which directly affect the energy metabolism of ppb wellington et al 1992 holt and marr 1965 demonstrated that the ppb strain rhodospirilllum rubrum grown under low infrared ir light irradiances of 1 7 w m2 wavelength range of 800 900 nm contained more bacteriochlorophyll than ppb grown under high light irradiances of 38 w m2 this indicates that bacteriochlorophyll pigments play the major role in ppb growth under ir light and ppb can adapt to low ir irradiance by increasing its bacteriochlorophyll content to date ppb has been used to treat wastewater with high cod n and p removal efficiencies of 80 and simultaneous ppb biomass production with high protein content and high nutrient recovery hülsen et al 2016 hülsen et al 2018 dalaei et al 2019 lu et al 2019a b conducted a long term study of a membrane photobioreactor to treat brewery wastewater with influent cod concentration of 2200 4800 mg l using photosynthetic bacteria grown under full spectrum light at 2000 lux 32 w m2 the cod removal efficiency varied from 60 to 99 while the average effluent cod concentration of 80 mg l was achieved at hrt of 72 h and at temperatures from 5 c to 25 c lu et al 2019a the ppb strain rhodopseudomonas palustris grown under full spectrum irradiances of 2000 5000 lux 32 80 w m2 was used by liu et al 2016 for the removal of cod n and p from food industry wastewater characterized by 3350 7560 mgcod l 200 mgn l and 34 mgp l cod n and p removal efficiencies from the food industry wastewater were 86 90 and 99 respectively at hrt of 48 h liu et al 2016 lu et al 2019b based on the literature the light dark cycle frequency had a great effect on the growth of photosynthetic microorganisms such as microalgae and ppb lee et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 conducted a series of batch tests to evaluate the impact of light dark cycles 1 h 2 h 1 5 h 1 5 h 2 h 1 h 2 5 h 0 5h as well as full illumination on cod removal from synthetic wastewater containing cod nh4 n and tp concentrations of 6000 400 and 90 mg l respectively this study was carried out using ppb pure culture rhodopseudomonas sp at temperatures of 26 30 c and light irradiance of 32 w m2 the highest cod removal efficiency of 90 was achieved at light dark cycles of 2 h 1 h and 1 5 h 1 5 h higher than the cod removal efficiency under full illumination 82 light dark cycle frequencies of greater than 4 times per days proved to be more efficient with a higher biomass production 25 and a higher cod removal efficiency 10 compared to the light dark cycle frequency of 2 times per day zhou et al 2015 to balance the energy inputs e g light mixing harvesting of the ppb growth researchers have evaluated the potential of energy recovery by anaerobic digestion of excess ppb biomass wasted from the photobioreactor as a result a new treatment platform known as partition release and recover was introduced as a way to generate energy from municipal wastewater while simultaneously recover nutrients from the concentrated digestate considering that the process concentrates the organics and micronutrients from wastewater into biosolid hülsen et al 2014 to this end hülsen et al 2017 used ppb biomass grown from red meat wastewater batch tests as substrate in batch mesophilic anaerobic digestion tests to determine the biological methane production the cumulative methane production was determined to be 381 mlch4 gvsadded after 42 days hülsen et al 2017 using high ir irradiances severely challenges the economic feasibility of ppb technology especially for application in the municipal space hence ir irradiance optimization is crucial for this technology to be cost effectively despite batch studies using ppb at low light irradiances for wastewater treatment could provide useful information the viability of low ir irradiance ppb treatment for municipal wastewater can only be proved in a continuous flow photobioreactor using indigenous ppb culture and real wastewater accordingly the specific goals of this study are a assessment of ppb performance with respect to cod n and p removal from municipal wastewater at ir light irradiances as low as 1 4 w m2 b determination of the optimum hydraulic retention time hrt and monod kinetic parameters c evaluating the effects of light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h on ppb performance and d testing the anaerobic biodegradability of ppb biomass 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw wastewater in this study raw municipal wastewater was collected from the greenway wastewater treatment plant located in london ontario after collection the wastewater was immediately stored in a cold room at a temperature of 4 c the wastewater was allowed to settle for a period of 2 h prior to being used as feed for the photobioreactor the settled effluent characteristics are summarized in table 1 2 2 ppb enrichment a series of fed batch tests were carried out to enrich the ppb in municipal wastewater under low ir light irradiance of 3 w m2 flat foam sheets were used to set the ir irradiance to 3 w m2 with values verified using a calibrated radiometer raw municipal wastewater was anaerobically illuminated while ethanol was dosed at 150 mgcod l the influent scod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations were 396 mg l 30 mg l and 3 4 mg l respectively the batch tests were conducted using two bottles with a working volume of 250 ml which were continuously mixed at 100 rpm the samples were allowed to settle for a duration of 2 h on days 4 8 12 16 and 20 then 200 ml of the supernatant was discarded and replaced with 200 ml of fresh raw wastewater added to the 50 ml ppb inoculum remained in the bottles the scod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations were measured every 4 days to evaluate ppb growth and cod n and p removal from municipal wastewater 2 3 low irradiance photo anaerobic membrane bioreactor a 2 l acrylic rectangular photobioreactor panmbr having a submerged flat sheet membrane kubota osaka japan with an area of 0 12 m2 fig 1 was used in this study this reactor is the same as the one employed by hülsen et al 2016 and in subsequent studies from this group the length width and height of the panmbr were 34 2 and 40 cm respectively four ir led lamps 96 ir led for night vision camera using foam sheets as diffusers were used to illuminate the photobioreactor at 3 and 1 4 w m2 the ir irradiance was measured using an ir sensor ocean optics hr 4000 a vacuum pump cole parmer air cadet r k 07530 85 was used to continuously mix the photobioreactor with internal gas from its headspace the experiments were carried out in anaerobic conditions and the dissolved oxygen do was measured on a daily basis during periods 1 7 the average do concentration was 0 08 mg l a diffuser at the bottom of the photobioreactor conveyed the headspace gas through the vacuum pump to the photobioreactor pre settled wastewater was continuously added to the photobioreactor with the aid of a peristaltic pump cole parmer 7520 67 masterflex console drive peristaltic pump the panmbr was operated at influent flow rates of 1 3 2 6 and 5 2 l d corresponding to hrts of 36 18 and 9 h respectively the hrt of 9 h corresponded to the maximum operating flux of the membrane 1 9 l m2 h and hrt of 36 h and 18 h were applied based on the operating conditions reported in the literature dalaei et al 2019 hülsen et al 2016 chemical analysis was conducted every three days to measure both the photoreactor influent and effluent compositions the sludge was withdrawn from the bottom of the photobioreactor to control sludge retention time srt ethanol was dosed to 200 mgcod l in periods 2 3 and 300 mgcod l in periods 4 7 to adjust the influent cod n p ratio to favorable ppb uptake ratio of 100 6 1 lu et al 2019b hülsen et al 2016 during the entire experimentation phase 7 periods the photobioreactor average temperature and ph were respectively 22 c and 7 3 steady state mass balances were calculated according to equation 1 at an srt of five days to determine the cod nitrogen and phosphorus mass closures which represent the percentage of the influent cod n and p recovered in the effluent and sludge 1 mass closure q effluent l d c effluent mg l q sludge l d c sludge mg l q influent l d c influent mg l where q and c represent flow rate in l d and concentration in mg l respectively a summary of the operating conditions for the panmbr is provided in table 2 the ir irradiances of 3 and 1 4 w m2 were defined to minimize the irradiance and energy consumption required for municipal wastewater treatment by ppb these irradiances were selected to reduce the irradiance of 50 w m2 utilized by hülsen et al 2016 and dalaei et al 2019 for municipal wastewater treatment using ppb by about an order of magnitude to improve process energy efficiency the photobioreactor was started using a 200 ml ppb inoculum with total chemical oxygen demand tcod and volatile suspended solids vss of 8800 mg l and 5950 mg l respectively the ppb inoculum used in the startup of panmbr was grown in the fed batch tests conducted at ir irradiance of 3 w m2 during start up 18 days the panmbr was operated at the hrt of 36 h with no biomass withdrawal during the steady state panmbr was operated at different hrts of 36 18 and 9 h the srt was set to 5 days during periods 1 7 when the panmbr was illuminated at 3 and 1 4 w m2 in period 7 the panmbr was operated in light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h under ir light irradiance of 1 4 w m2 the light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h frequency of 6 times per day were used based on the optimum light dark frequency reported in the literature zhou et al 2015 the panmbr was opened two times on days 24 and 60 after periods 2 and 4 respectively to remove the accumulated biofilm on the membrane surface and the reactor walls the panmbr s operation for long periods especially at short hrts 9 h led to the formation of the ppb biofilm the ppb biofilm accumulation on the membrane and the lack of a source of energy required for ppb growth caused the release of phosphorus from the ppb biofilm which impaired the performance of the photobioreactor period 7 2 4 analytical methods the following parameters were measured based on the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater 18th edition apha 1998 total chemical oxygen demand tcod total nitrogen tn total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn total phosphorous tp volatile fatty acid vfa and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod

irradiance spectrum of the led lamp used in this study was measured in trojan technologies lamp laboratory and is reported in fig 2 the initial measurement was for the point with the shortest distance from the ir lamp ɵ 0 which was determined by integrating the emitted light curve between the wavelengths of 750 nm and 900 nm and estimating the irradiance level at the photobioreactor surface using a radial light transport model in a monochromatic equivalent scenario the area under curves a and b were determined to be 1 4 w m2 and 3 w m2 respectively a 22ҳ11 matrix was defined to determine ir light irradiance for each point and the average ir light irradiance for the whole surface of the panmbr fig 1 supplementary information shows schematic view of the panmbr and ir lamps a correction factor of r 1 2 r 2 2 cos θ was applied to determine ir light irradiances of each cell of matrix where r1 and r2 are two and three dimensional distances between the center point of the cells of panmbr and lamp s center point respectively and ɵ is the angle between r1 and r2 the average ir light irradiances for each of the two lamps were determined to be 1 5 and 0 7 w m2 therefore although the target ir light irradiances were 3 and 1 5 w m2 the total ir light irradiances were 3 and 1 4 w m2 as each side of the surface of panmbr was covered by two lamps the matrix plot for ir light irradiance of 3 w m2 is provided in table i see supplementary information file 2 6 microbial growth and batch activity tests the full spectrum 400 900 nm optical density od test was used to evaluate the absorbance behaviour of the samples collected from the panmbr during periods 3 and 5 hrt of 18 h and light irradiances of 3 and 1 4 w m2 respectively as well as period 7 when the photobioreactor was operated under the light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h this analysis was performed using dr 3900 spectrophotometer which demonstrated the presence of bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid pigments in the ppb s cell the optical density od peaks at wavelengths of 590 800 and 860 nm show the presence of bacteriochlorophyll pigments while the two peaks at 460 and 488 nm reflect the presence of carotenoid pigments in the ppb batch activity tests were carried out using a combination of 150 ml fresh wastewater 100 mgcod l ethanol and 50 ml ppb inoculum from the photobioreactor at an hrt of 9 h and an ir irradiance of 3 w m2 period 4 the mixture of the inoculum fresh wastewater and ethanol had initial scod nh4 n po4 3 p and vss concentrations of 292 24 5 3 and 360 mg l respectively 10 ml samples were collected hourly for a period of 8 h to measure the soluble cod and vss concentrations 2 7 monod kinetic model the monod kinetic model was used to determine the ppb kinetics in the batch simulations

using an automatic methane potential test system ampts ii bioprocess control sweden unit triplicate reactors were filled with thickened ppb biomass as substrate 50 ml ads as inoculum 25 ml and diluted with distilled water to a total volume of 350 ml in 500 ml reactors the ratio of initial substrate to inoculum s x was fixed at 2 0 g cod g cod and the test was conducted at mesophilic temperature 37 c mixing was performed intermittently and the test was continued for 30 days consecutively blanks containing only inoculum were included and monitored in the experiment and hence the background biogas

n2 gas for 3 min 1 l min at the start of the test incubation temperature was 37 c using the thermostatic water bath no external nutrients alkalinity or https www sciencedirect com topics earth and planetary sciences trace elementchemicals were added to the reactors before or during the bmp test and no pre treatment method was applied to enhance the ppb biomass biodegradability the characteristics of the ppb biomass and the inoculum are summarized in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 ppb fed batch tests inoculum generation the scod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations in the fed batch tests were measured for a period of 20 days supplementary information the low scod nh4 n and po4 3 p removal efficiencies of 12 9 and 15 respectively on day 8 were due to the inadequate ppb culture at the beginning of the fed batch tests days 1 8 on day 20 the scod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations were measured at 134 13 and 1 2 mg l respectively corresponding to the scod nh4 n and po4 3 p removal efficiencies of 66 57 and 65 3 2 photobioreactor operation and optimization during the start up the average effluent tcod tn and tp concentrations were 137 82 mg l 15 6 mg l and 1 5 1 mg l respectively corresponding to tcod tn and tp removal efficiencies of 77 62 and 73 steady state effluent tcod tn and tp concentrations as well as tcod tn and tp removal efficiencies are summarized in table 4 the temporal cod n and p variations are illustrated in fig 3 supplementary information file the effluent substrate concentrations were below target limits of 50 mgcod l 10 mgn l and 1 mgp l during periods 2 6 when ethanol was dosed at an average concentration of 260 mgcod l these results showed ppb s high potential for municipal wastewater treatment at ir light irradiance of as low as 1 4 w m2 in periods 1 6 the average tcod tn tp uptake ratio by ppb at steady state was 100 6 1 however this ratio decreased to 100 4 5 0 59 during period 7 when the panmbr was operated in light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h the photobioreactor s color changed from red to purple in period 7 indicating that the ppb culture in light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h was different than the ppb culture in periods 1 6 full light steady state mass balances in periods 4 and 6 at the minimum hrt of 9 h showed cod mass closure of 82 4 and 81 3 tn mass closure of 86 4 and 83 2 as well as tp mass closure of 83 4 and 81 1 respectively the average cod tn and tp mass closures were 81 3 85 2 and 83 2 in period 1 84 1 83 3 and 84 4 in period 2 85 3 86 1 and 86 2 in period 3 as well as 81 4 82 3 and 81 4 in period 5 respectively in periods 2 6 the average effluent cod n and p concentrations were 37 mg l 6 mg l and 0 62 mg l respectively the high effluent nitrogen concentration of 24 mg l removal efficiency of 44 in period 1 was due to insufficient carbon the nitrogen removal efficiency increased significantly to more than 80 with the addition of ethanol in periods 2 6 the photobioreactor s operation at different hrts 9 36 h had no substantial effect on tcod removal efficiencies 92 effluent n and p concentrations increased in both periods 4 and 6 when the hrt decreased from 18 h to 9 h the temporal variation of the cod n p uptake ratio by ppb in periods 1 6 is depicted in fig 3 it is evident from fig 3 that the ratio of cod n p uptake by the ppb was consistently stable throughout the study irrespective of change in hrt and light irradiance at 3 and 1 4 w m2 in period 7 when the photobioreactor was operated in the light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h the average effluent nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations were 11 and 1 8 mg l respectively however the average effluent cod concentration was 43 mg l the high effluent phosphorous concentration in this period was due to the release of phosphorous from the ppb biofilm formed on the membrane table ii supplementary information shows a comparison of the scod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations in the photobioreactor and the membrane permeate final effluent the average po4 3 p concentration in the photobioreactor was 0 49 0 2 mg l which was significantly lower than the effluent phosphorous concentration of the samples taken from the membrane permeate 1 8 0 3 mg l the scod nh4 n and po4 3 p analysis of the samples taken from the membrane permeate and from the photobioreactor at days 103 108 indicated that 1 4 mg po4 3 p l was released from the ppb biofilm on the membrane which significantly decreased the ppb performance with respect to phosphorous removal in period 7 based on table ii si the average effluent scod and nh4 n concentrations were 43 and 9 mg l respectively however the scod and nh4 n concentrations of the filtered samples taken from the panmbr were 55 and 10 mg l respectively a paired t test was conducted to compare scod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations in the panmbr and the membrane permeate final effluent to evaluate the effect of the membrane on the scod nh4 n and po4 3 p removal efficiencies and the ppb performance based on the results of the t test there were statistically significant differences in the scod nh4 n and po4 3 p specifically cod decreased by 14 4 mg l nitrogen decreased by 1 0 7 mg l and phosphorous increased by 1 3 0 3 mgp l uncertainty in means expressed at the 95 ci for a paired t test two tailed p values for these differences were 0 0001 0 001 and 0 0001 respectively the simultaneous cod uptake and phosphorous release in this period indicates the accumulation of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos on the membrane during the light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h because the ratio of cod uptake to p release was 9 3 1 close to typical ratio of 10 1 for paos metcalf and eddy 2004 however there was no phosphorus released from the ppb biomass under full illumination periods 1 6 these results suggest that in the absence of light the energy required for ppb growth is potentially obtained from the release of stored polyphosphate from the ppb biomass ppb released the stored polyphosphate to produce energy when they were incubated under insufficient light tinsley and gotschlich 1995 lai et al 2017 indicated that when the energy source was removed ppb released intracellular polyphosphate to generate energy for growth it was noted that when the light source was removed the ratio of cod uptake to p release was 10 0 77 lai et al 2017 the photobioreactor s mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss during periods 1 7 are depicted in fig 4 the range of mlss and mlvss in periods 1 7 varied from 290 to 1250 mg l and from 240 to 1090 mg l respectively which were correlated with the hrt the average ratio of mlvss to mlss was 0 85 0 05 which was stable during periods 1 7 biomass yields were 0 49 0 52 0 50 and 0 55 gvss gcod in periods 1 2 3 and 4 respectively ir irradiance of 3 w m2 at 1 4 w m2 the yields were 0 46 and 0 47 gvss gcod in periods 5 and 6 respectively the yield was calculated using the linear correlation between cumulative vss production ppb biomass wasted daily and cumulative cod removal the potential methanogenesis at low light intensity may be the reason for the slightly lower 10 yields at 1 4 w m2 in comparison with the yields at 3 w m2 3 3 microbial growth the results of the optical density od tests at light irradiances of 3 and 1 4 w m2 as well as the light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h at the ir light irradiance of 1 4 w m2 are depicted in fig 5 the od tests were carried out when the photobioreactor was operated at hrt and srt of 18 h and 5 days respectively in periods 3 and 5 the od tests were also conducted at an hrt of 9 h and the srt of 5 days in period 7 during the light dark cycles the od profile of the samples taken from the photobioreactor at the above mentioned light irradiances showed the presence of bacteriochlorophyll pigments with three peaks at 590 800 and 860 nm and the presence of carotenoid pigments with two peaks at 460 and 488 nm these results are consistent with ppb s absorbance behaviour which shows a similar trend with peaks attributed to the above mentioned pigments cohen bazire et al 1957 according to fig 5 od values for the sample grown at 1 4 w m2 were 4 0 4 1 3 5 and 3 9 respectively at wavelengths of 460 488 800 and 860 nm however od results for the panmbr s sample grown at 3 w m2 were determined to be 4 3 4 3 3 1 and 3 4 at wavelengths of 460 488 800 and 860 nm respectively relatively higher od values at 800 and 860 nm for ppb grown at light irradiance of 1 4 w m2 showed a higher production of the bacteriochlorophyll pigments due to the adaptation of the ppb to low light irradiances however the higher od values at 460 and 488 nm for the ppb grown under the light irradiance of 3 w m2 indicated that the amount of carotenoid pigments increased with higher light irradiances which is consistent with the literature zhou et al 2014 bacteriochlorophyll pigments play a major role in the ppb structure to harvest light and energy required for growth in period 7 od values for the sample taken from the photobioreactor at light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h were 7 7 7 6 6 1 and 6 1 respectively at wavelengths of 460 488 800 and 860 nm fig 5 3 4 monod kinetic parameters monod kinetic parameters in the batch tests at the low ir light irradiance of 3 w m2 were determined by solving monod equations in matlab matlab r2017a the mathworks inc natick ma monod kinetic parameters km and y were determined to be 1 9 0 09 mgcod mgvss d and 0 38 0 09 mgvss mgcod respectively 95 ci the correlation coefficient r of parameters km and y was 0 5 and had a fairly narrow confidence interval ks and kd were assumed to be 20 mgcod l and 0 09 d 1 puyol et al 2017 the comparisons between the theoretical and experimental substrate removal and cell growth depicted in fig 6 a b the average absolute percentages of the discrepancy between experimental data and monod fit for substrate s removal and cell x growth were 4 and 3 respectively which demonstrates the accuracy of the model parameters table 5 summarizes the ppb monod kinetic parameters by comparing these parameters with the parameters obtained at high ir light irradiance puyol et al 2017 dalaei et al 2019 it appears that ppb yield biomass specific substrate utilization rates and maximum specific growth rate μmax at the ir irradiance of 3 w m2 were slightly lower than the ppb kinetics at irradiance of 50 w m2 reported by dalaei et al 2019 and approximately half those reported by puyol et al 2017 the reduced yield indicates alternative carbon and electron sinks the decrease in uptake rate is naturally due to the lower light input which means that light input rather than substrate input is limiting uptake the reduction in yield of 40 from 0 63 to 0 39 was likely related to this reduced uptake rate phototrophs were no longer able to outcompete methanogens and hence a large proportion of the substrate was lost to methanogenic activity than has not been observed at higher irradiation levels the main energy inputs for the photobioreactor are lighting and mixing energy for membrane scouring the mixing energy was determined to be 0 15 kwh m3 hülsen et al 2017 high light irradiance of 50 w m2 was utilized to evaluate the ppb s viability in municipal wastewater treatment using continuous flow photobioreactor dalaei et al 2019 hülsen et al 2016 the high energy consumption 24 kwh m3 for the above mentioned light irradiance challenges the practical application of the ppb technology based on the results of this study excellent ppb performance with respect to cod n and p removal was achieved at light irradiances of 3 and 1 4 w m2 which significantly decreased energy consumption for lighting to 1 44 and 0 67 kwh m3 these results expand the potential of the ppb technology for municipal wastewater treatment using a membrane photobioreactor reducing light energy by up to 97 3 5 anaerobic digestion and methane production from ppb biomass the methane production from the ppb biomass grown under low light irradiance from municipal wastewater is shown in fig 7 the time course of methane production fitted the first order model very well with a methane yield of 142 nmlch4 gcodadded 240 nmlch4 gvssadded based on the observed cod vss ratio for ppb of 1 7 with a first order rate coefficient of 0 12 d 1 the average methane production rate at 37 c was 0 017 mlch4 mgvss d samples of the digested sludge in the bmp test were characterized for nutrients solids and cod both in particulate and soluble fractions the nutrient release potentials during anaerobic digestion were calculated by comparing the particulate nutrient contents of the digested sludge with the nutrients in the fresh sludge used in the bmp reactors the overall anaerobic biodegradability of the ppb biomass was roughly 41 another concern with the anaerobic digestion of ppb biomass used as substrate for nutrient removal is the considerable release of nutrients solubilization was defined as the difference in soluble nitrogen or phosphorus concentrations between before and after digestion divided by their respective initial particulate concentrations by measuring the total soluble and particulate fractions of the nutrients normalized to the total and volatile solids present in the reactor 1840 mg l and 1160 mg l respectively as shown in table 6 nutrients release during anaerobic digestion were calculated at 22 mgnh4 n gvs added and 5 mgtp gvs added during the process these values account for 27 and 36 of particulate n and particulate p solubilization respectively table 6 the methane yield of 240 mlch4 gvssadded from the anaerobic digestion of ppb biomass was comparable with the methane yield of 218 nmlch4 gvs from the anaerobic digestion of the waste activated sludge was reported by filer et al 2019 these results showed that the biomethane potential of the ppb biomass was comparable to the biomethane potential of was using the methane yield of 240 nmlch4 gvssadded the rate of wasted ppb biomass from the panmbr of 0 06 l d with the vss of 6 2 g l the treated wastewater flowrate of 0 0052 m3 d at 9 h hrt and 35 8 mj m3ch4 the energy recovered for ppb digestion is 0 17 kwh m3 of wastewater treated based on the energy consumption of 0 33 0 67 kwh m3 attributed to the photobioreactor s illumination in periods 6 7 the net energy consumption required for municipal wastewater treatment by ppb was determined to be 0 16 0 5 kwh m3 this is comparable with the energy consumption of the traditional wastewater treatment plants of 0 47 0 2 kwh m3 gurung et al 2018 crawford and sandino 2010 and goldstein and smith 2002 also indicated that the required energy consumption for traditional wastewater treatment plants was 0 37 kwh m3 3 6 estimation of full scale energy cost of ppb considering the results obtained from this study external carbon must be added to adjust the cod n ratio of municipal wastewater to 100 6 using typical values the energy and supplemental carbon costs for a 1 mld plant were evaluated as shown in this study with a typical medium strength wastewater characteristic an average external carbon concentration of 260 mgcod l corresponding to 40 gallons of ethanol per day was required to achieve an effluent nitrogen concentration below the target limit of 10 mg l this challenges the economic feasibility of ppb technology when nitrogen removal from wastewater is critical as the cost of the external carbon source and its transportation and storage increase debarbadillo et al 2008 assessment of new options and technologies to reduce the use of an external carbon source is critical the fermentation of sludge is one of the methods that can generate readily biodegradable carbon source for denitrification processes elefsiniotis et al 2004 fig 8 shows the overall scheme of a case study conducted to further investigate the energy requirement for a 1 mld capacity wastewater treatment plant using ppb technology it should be mentioned that only the major energy demands ignoring the energy for primary treatment membrane in secondary treatment i e pumping and fouling control biosolids thickening and dewatering and recovery through anaerobic digestion have been considered in these calculations some assumptions were made to simplify the model as shown in the flow diagram depicted in fig 8 to evaluate the potential use of internal carbon source by generating volatile fatty acids vfa through sludge fermentation and the capacity for energy recovery through anaerobic digestion using both primary sludge after fermentation as well as ppb sludge the following assumptions were made suspended solids removal efficiency through primary clarifier is 70 raw wastewater contains 160 mgvss l medium strength the average vfa yield for primary sludge fermentation is 143 mgvfa gvss in the feed peces et al 2016 the average methane production yield for ppb waste sludge is 240 nmlch4 gvssadded based on bmp measurements conducted in the present study the average methane production yield for primary sludge after fermentation is 260 nmlch4 gvs peces et al 2016 the cod equivalent of ethanol is 2 09 gcod gethanol and cod equivalent for volatile fatty acids is assumed to be 1 1 gcod gvfa the density of ethanol and average vfas are 800 and 1000 kg m3 respectively based on the above mentioned assumptions 18 kgvfa d can be generated from the primary sludge fermentation this is significantly lower than the required cod of 260 kgcod d for a 1 mld plant however the fermentation of the primary sludge can reduce the use of the external carbon source by roughly 7 the external required cod concentration of 260 mg cod l is equivalent to 124 l ethanol for a 1 mld plant table 7 summarizes the estimated operating energy and chemical costs for 1 mld plant using ppb technology interestingly the total energy demand of the ppb bioreactor of 1 73 gj d 480 kwh d is almost satisfied by the methane energy generated of 1 7 gj d implying that the ppb treatment at the optimized light irradiance and with alternate light dark cycle of 2h 2h can be energy neutral with a net energy consumption of 0 03 gj d or 0 008 kwh m3 of wastewater sensitivity analysis showed that the net energy consumption for the panmbr using ppb were 0 43 gj d 0 115 kwh m3 and 0 4 gj d 0 107 kwh m3 corresponding to anaerobic ppb biomass degradabilities of 30 and 50 respectively as shown in table 7 the methane energy generated recovers almost a fifth the mixing and illumination energy cost of the ppb bioreactor the overall cost of ppb technology for the treatment of municipal wastewater in a 1 mld plant was determined to be 94 d predominantly for external carbon requirements and illumination energy based on table 7 the value of the 50 m3 methane generated from the digestion of ppb biomass and fermented primary sludge ps can reduce the ppb operating costs by 10 4 summary and conclusions the results of this study demonstrate the potential of the purple phototrophic bacteria ppb in treating municipal wastewater at ir light irradiance of as low as 1 4 w m2 an order of magnitude lower than previously assessed yield was slightly lower at 0 38 kgvss kgcod kinetic parameters were lower than previous analysis at high irradiation levels higher production of bacteriochlorophyll at lower light irradiance of 1 4 w m2 indicated that ppb can adapt its structure to low light irradiances to generate sufficient energy for growth although using this low light input can achieve near parity with energy gained from anaerobic digestion of primary sludge and ppb the need for external carbon remains making photo assimilative treatment of domestic wastewater economically challenging the major findings are 1 anaerobic phototrophic municipal wastewater treatment with ppb can achieve average effluent cod n and p concentrations of below 37 mg l 6 mg l and 0 62 mg l respectively with an external cod addition 260 mg l at low ir irradiances of 3 and 1 4 w m2 2 the net energy consumption for municipal wastewater treatment by ppb was determined to be 0 5 and 0 16 kwh m3 under full illumination 1 4 w m2 and with light dark cycle of 2 h 2 h 1 4 w m2 respectively using harvested energy from the anaerobic digestion of ppb biomass with anaerobic digestion of both primary sludge and ppb biomass the net energy consumption of the ppb bioreactor at 1 4 w m2 and with light dark cycle of 2 h 2 h is only 0 008 kwh m3 3 monod kinetic parameters km and y were determined to be 1 9 mgcod mgvss d 0 38 mgvss mgcod respectively at the low light irradiance of 3 w m2 it must be asserted however that although the results of this study indicate that from an energy perspective the panmbr can be competitive with activated sludge there are many scale up challenges facing the technology these include but are not limited to light transmissivity in large deep reactors with much lower specific surface area than used in this study membrane fouling impact of membrane cleaning agents on ppb activity potential methane generation with the associated health and safety requirements supplemental carbon requirements

18086,light energy is one of the major costs for phototrophic systems this study evaluated the photoreactor efficiency of purple phototropic bacteria anaerobic membrane bioreactor panmbr at low irradiance for the treatment of municipal wastewater infrared irradiance levels of 3 0 and 1 4 w m2 produced by an infrared ir lamp emitting in the 800 900 nm wavelength range were investigated with the ultimate goal of optimizing the irradiance energy demand experimental and modeling results demonstrated the ability of ppb to grow and treat raw municipal wastewater at the applied low irradiances with effluent quality below target limits of tcod 50 mg l tn 10 mg l and tp 1 mg l while monod kinetic parameters km and y were determined to be lower than previous high energy studies 1 9 mgcod mgvss d and 0 38 mgvss mgcod respectively the photobioreactor performance were consistently maintained indicating that energy cost associated with ir illumination can be reduced by up to 97 to determine whether the treatment process could approach energy neutrality subsequent anaerobic digestion experiments of the residual ppb biomass proved a potential for biogas recovery of up to 240 nmlch4 gvssadded and a moderate biomass biodegradability of 41 as a result the net energy consumption of the process was estimated at 0 5 kwh m3 of treated municipal wastewater considering an energy demand for illumination of 0 67 kwh m3 and an energy recovery attributed to the anaerobic digestion of 0 17 kwh m3 from the excess ppb biomass wasted from panmbr keywords purple phototrophic bacteria municipal wastewater low irradiance monod kinetics 1 introduction ppb have shown to have potential in applications such as municipal and industrial wastewater treatment due to the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia through assimilation azad et al 2001 phosphorous uptake by polyphosphate poly p formation hiraishi et al 1991 as well as nitrate removal through denitrification kim et al 2004 long term operation of a laboratory scale membrane photobioreactor at an infrared ir light irradiance of 50 w m2 indicated that high simultaneous removal of chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen n and phosphorous p from municipal wastewater 80 were achieved at temperatures of 22 c and 11 c hülsen et al 2016 dalaei et al 2019 the estimated energy consumption of 24 kwh m3 of reactor volume in dalaei at al 2019 is based on the ir irradiance of 50w m2 and the illuminated surface to volume ratio of 20 m2 m3 the aforementioned high energy consumption is a major concern for the application of ppb in municipal wastewater treatment industry only a few batch literature studies evaluated ppb performance at irradiances of below 50 w m2 moreover studies at irradiances of below 50 w m2 were carried out using pure ppb cultures and synthetic wastewater kim et al 2004 zhou et al 2014 prasertsan et al 1993 prasertsan et al 1993 indicated that the optimum light irradiance for the growth of rhodocyclus gelatinosus ppb stain and cod removal from diluted tuna condensate wastewater was 48 w m2 using batch cultivation tests at 30 c a series of batch tests were conducted by kim et al 2004 to evaluate organic acid removal from swine wastewater by a ppb strain rhodopseudomonas palustris at different light irradiances ranging from 8 to 80 w m2 to achieve the optimal light irradiance according to the aforementioned authors the optimum light irradiance of 64 w m2 was achieved with an overall organic acid acetic acid propionic acid isobutyric acid butyric acid isovaleric acid valeric acid and caproic acid removal efficiency of 83 however ir irradiance was reduced to 8 w m2 the organic acid removal efficiency by ppb was low 20 zhou et al 2014 demonstrated that the optimum light irradiance for ppb biomass production and cod removal from synthetic wastewater containing cod nh4 n and tp concentrations of 6000 400 and 90 mg l respectively was 32 w m2 the aforementioned study used a series of batch tests at different light irradiances of 500 1000 2000 4000 and 8000 lux equivalent to 8 16 32 64 and 128 w m2 irradiances were calculated using a conversion factor of 1 lux 0 0161028 w m2 based on vasiliadou et al 2018 it was noted that the cod removal efficiency decreased with higher ir irradiances higher than 80 w m2 due to photo inhibition zhang et al 2014 the full spectrum irradiance is known to also affect the synthesis of light harvesting pigments such as bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid produced by ppb which directly affect the energy metabolism of ppb wellington et al 1992 holt and marr 1965 demonstrated that the ppb strain rhodospirilllum rubrum grown under low infrared ir light irradiances of 1 7 w m2 wavelength range of 800 900 nm contained more bacteriochlorophyll than ppb grown under high light irradiances of 38 w m2 this indicates that bacteriochlorophyll pigments play the major role in ppb growth under ir light and ppb can adapt to low ir irradiance by increasing its bacteriochlorophyll content to date ppb has been used to treat wastewater with high cod n and p removal efficiencies of 80 and simultaneous ppb biomass production with high protein content and high nutrient recovery hülsen et al 2016 hülsen et al 2018 dalaei et al 2019 lu et al 2019a b conducted a long term study of a membrane photobioreactor to treat brewery wastewater with influent cod concentration of 2200 4800 mg l using photosynthetic bacteria grown under full spectrum light at 2000 lux 32 w m2 the cod removal efficiency varied from 60 to 99 while the average effluent cod concentration of 80 mg l was achieved at hrt of 72 h and at temperatures from 5 c to 25 c lu et al 2019a the ppb strain rhodopseudomonas palustris grown under full spectrum irradiances of 2000 5000 lux 32 80 w m2 was used by liu et al 2016 for the removal of cod n and p from food industry wastewater characterized by 3350 7560 mgcod l 200 mgn l and 34 mgp l cod n and p removal efficiencies from the food industry wastewater were 86 90 and 99 respectively at hrt of 48 h liu et al 2016 lu et al 2019b based on the literature the light dark cycle frequency had a great effect on the growth of photosynthetic microorganisms such as microalgae and ppb lee et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 conducted a series of batch tests to evaluate the impact of light dark cycles 1 h 2 h 1 5 h 1 5 h 2 h 1 h 2 5 h 0 5h as well as full illumination on cod removal from synthetic wastewater containing cod nh4 n and tp concentrations of 6000 400 and 90 mg l respectively this study was carried out using ppb pure culture rhodopseudomonas sp at temperatures of 26 30 c and light irradiance of 32 w m2 the highest cod removal efficiency of 90 was achieved at light dark cycles of 2 h 1 h and 1 5 h 1 5 h higher than the cod removal efficiency under full illumination 82 light dark cycle frequencies of greater than 4 times per days proved to be more efficient with a higher biomass production 25 and a higher cod removal efficiency 10 compared to the light dark cycle frequency of 2 times per day zhou et al 2015 to balance the energy inputs e g light mixing harvesting of the ppb growth researchers have evaluated the potential of energy recovery by anaerobic digestion of excess ppb biomass wasted from the photobioreactor as a result a new treatment platform known as partition release and recover was introduced as a way to generate energy from municipal wastewater while simultaneously recover nutrients from the concentrated digestate considering that the process concentrates the organics and micronutrients from wastewater into biosolid hülsen et al 2014 to this end hülsen et al 2017 used ppb biomass grown from red meat wastewater batch tests as substrate in batch mesophilic anaerobic digestion tests to determine the biological methane production the cumulative methane production was determined to be 381 mlch4 gvsadded after 42 days hülsen et al 2017 using high ir irradiances severely challenges the economic feasibility of ppb technology especially for application in the municipal space hence ir irradiance optimization is crucial for this technology to be cost effectively despite batch studies using ppb at low light irradiances for wastewater treatment could provide useful information the viability of low ir irradiance ppb treatment for municipal wastewater can only be proved in a continuous flow photobioreactor using indigenous ppb culture and real wastewater accordingly the specific goals of this study are a assessment of ppb

parameters c evaluating the effects of light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h on ppb performance and d testing the anaerobic biodegradability of ppb biomass 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw wastewater in this study raw municipal wastewater was collected from the greenway wastewater treatment plant located in london ontario after collection the wastewater was immediately stored in a cold room at a temperature of 4 c the wastewater was allowed to settle for a period of 2 h prior to being used as feed for the photobioreactor the settled effluent characteristics are summarized in table 1 2 2 ppb enrichment a series of fed batch tests were carried out to enrich the ppb in municipal wastewater under low ir light irradiance of 3 w m2 flat foam sheets were used to set the ir irradiance to 3 w m2 with values verified using a calibrated radiometer raw municipal wastewater was anaerobically illuminated while ethanol was dosed at 150 mgcod l the influent scod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations were 396 mg l 30 mg l and 3 4 mg l respectively the batch tests were conducted using two bottles with a working volume of 250 ml which were continuously mixed at 100 rpm the samples were allowed to settle for a duration of 2 h on days 4 8 12 16 and 20 then 200 ml of the supernatant was discarded and replaced with 200 ml of fresh raw wastewater added to the 50 ml ppb inoculum remained in the bottles the scod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations were measured every 4 days to evaluate ppb growth and cod n and p removal from municipal wastewater 2 3 low irradiance photo anaerobic membrane bioreactor a 2 l

by hülsen et al 2016 and in subsequent studies from this group the length width and height of the panmbr were 34 2 and 40 cm respectively four ir led lamps 96 ir led for night vision camera using foam sheets as diffusers were used to illuminate the photobioreactor at 3 and 1 4 w m2 the ir irradiance was measured using an ir sensor ocean optics hr 4000 a vacuum pump cole parmer air cadet r k 07530 85 was used to continuously mix the photobioreactor with internal gas from its headspace the experiments were carried out in anaerobic conditions and the dissolved oxygen do was measured on a daily basis during periods 1 7 the average do concentration was 0 08 mg l a diffuser at the bottom of the photobioreactor conveyed the headspace gas through the vacuum pump to the photobioreactor pre settled wastewater was continuously added to the photobioreactor with the aid of a peristaltic pump cole parmer 7520 67 masterflex console drive peristaltic pump the panmbr was operated at influent flow rates of 1 3 2 6 and 5 2 l d corresponding to hrts of 36 18 and 9 h respectively the hrt of 9 h corresponded to the maximum operating flux of the membrane 1 9 l m2 h and hrt of 36 h and 18 h were applied based on the operating conditions reported in the literature dalaei et al 2019 hülsen et al 2016 chemical analysis was conducted every three days to measure both the photoreactor influent and effluent compositions the sludge was withdrawn from the bottom of the photobioreactor to control sludge retention time srt ethanol was dosed to 200 mgcod l in periods 2 3 and 300 mgcod l in periods 4 7 to adjust the influent cod n p ratio to favorable ppb uptake ratio of 100 6 1 lu et al 2019b hülsen et al 2016 during the entire experimentation phase 7 periods the photobioreactor average temperature and ph were respectively 22 c and 7 3 steady state mass balances were calculated according to equation 1 at an srt of five days to determine the cod nitrogen and phosphorus mass closures which represent the percentage of the influent cod n and p recovered in the effluent and sludge 1 mass closure q effluent l d c effluent mg l q sludge l d c sludge mg l q influent l d c influent mg l where q and c represent flow rate in l d and concentration in mg l respectively a summary of the operating conditions for the panmbr is provided in table 2 the ir irradiances of 3 and 1 4 w m2 were defined to minimize the irradiance and energy consumption required for municipal wastewater treatment by ppb these irradiances were selected to reduce the irradiance of 50 w m2 utilized by hülsen et al 2016 and dalaei et al 2019 for municipal wastewater treatment using ppb by about an order of magnitude to improve process energy efficiency the photobioreactor was started using a 200 ml ppb inoculum with total chemical oxygen demand tcod and volatile suspended solids vss of 8800 mg l and 5950 mg l respectively the ppb inoculum used in the startup of panmbr was grown in the fed batch tests conducted at ir irradiance of 3 w m2 during start up 18 days the panmbr was operated at the hrt of 36 h with no biomass withdrawal during the steady state panmbr was operated at different hrts of 36 18 and 9 h the srt was set to 5 days during periods 1 7 when the panmbr was illuminated at 3 and 1 4 w m2 in period 7 the panmbr was operated in light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h under ir light irradiance of 1 4 w m2 the light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h frequency of 6 times per day were used based on the optimum light dark frequency reported in the literature zhou et al 2015 the panmbr was opened two times on days 24 and 60 after periods 2 and 4 respectively to remove the accumulated biofilm on the membrane surface and the reactor walls the panmbr s operation for long periods especially at short hrts 9 h led to the formation of the ppb biofilm the ppb biofilm accumulation on the membrane and the lack of a source of energy required for ppb growth caused the release of phosphorus from the ppb biofilm which impaired the performance of the photobioreactor period 7 2 4 analytical methods the following parameters were measured based on the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater 18th edition apha 1998 total chemical oxygen demand tcod total nitrogen tn total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn total phosphorous tp volatile fatty acid vfa and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were determined according to the hach standard methods using a hach spectrophotometer hach odyssey dr 2800 total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were determined according to standard methods apha 1998 all soluble samples were prepared using a membrane filter with a 0 45 μm pore size gn metricel membrane disc filters pall laboratory 2 5 ir irradiance measurement the irradiance spectrum of the led lamp used in this study was measured in trojan technologies lamp laboratory and is reported in fig 2 the initial measurement was for the point with the shortest distance from the ir lamp ɵ 0 which was determined by integrating the emitted light curve between the wavelengths of 750 nm and 900 nm and estimating the irradiance level at the photobioreactor surface using a radial light transport model in a monochromatic equivalent scenario the area under curves a and b were determined to be 1 4 w m2 and 3 w m2 respectively a 22ҳ11 matrix was defined to determine ir light irradiance for each point and the average ir light irradiance for the whole surface of the panmbr fig 1 supplementary information shows schematic view of the panmbr and ir lamps a correction factor of r 1 2 r 2 2 cos θ was applied to determine ir light irradiances of each cell of matrix where r1 and r2 are two and three dimensional distances between the center point of the cells of panmbr and lamp s center point respectively and ɵ is the angle between r1 and r2 the average ir light irradiances for each of the two lamps were determined to be 1 5 and 0 7 w m2 therefore although the target ir light irradiances were 3 and 1 5 w m2 the total ir light irradiances were 3 and 1 4 w m2 as each side of the surface of panmbr was covered by two lamps the matrix plot for ir light irradiance of 3 w m2 is provided in table i see supplementary information file 2 6 microbial growth and batch activity tests the full spectrum 400 900 nm optical density od test was used to evaluate the absorbance behaviour of the samples collected from the panmbr during periods 3 and 5 hrt of 18 h and light irradiances of 3 and 1 4 w m2 respectively as well as period 7 when the photobioreactor was operated under the light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h this analysis was performed using dr 3900 spectrophotometer which demonstrated the presence of bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid pigments in the ppb s cell the optical density od peaks at wavelengths of 590 800 and 860 nm show the presence of bacteriochlorophyll pigments while the two peaks at 460 and 488 nm reflect the presence of carotenoid pigments in the ppb batch activity tests were carried out using a combination of 150 ml fresh wastewater 100 mgcod l ethanol and 50 ml ppb inoculum from the photobioreactor at an hrt of 9 h and an ir irradiance of 3 w m2 period 4 the mixture of the inoculum fresh wastewater and ethanol had initial scod nh4 n po4 3 p and vss concentrations of 292 24 5 3 and 360 mg l respectively 10 ml samples were collected hourly for a period of 8 h to measure the soluble cod and vss concentrations 2 7 monod kinetic model the monod kinetic model was used to determine the ppb kinetics in the batch simulations in order to simulate this model matlab matlab r2017a the mathworks inc natick ma was used to determine the parameters km and y monod equations a system of differential equations equation 2 and 3 with variables x t and s t and parameters km and y was solved using ode45 curve fitting was used to evaluate the best fit of parameters to monod equations considering the experimental data x t and s t which were measured at time intervals of 1 h using batch tests only two parameters were identifiable for the batch tests km and y and hence the remaining parameters were set to previously identified values puyol et al 2017 the matlab code used for the parameter estimation is supplied in the supplementary information 2 dx dt y k m sx k s s k d x 3 ds dt k m sx k s s where ks is the half velocity

tests of ppb the biochemical methane potential bmp test was conducted on collected mixed liquor suspended solids mlss sample taken from the photobioreactor which was operated at ir light irradiance of 3 w m2 ppb biomass the sample was centrifuged and thickened to separate the ppb biomass which was then added to the reactors and used as substrate for the anaerobic bmp test the inoculum anaerobic digested sludge ads was collected from the stratford wastewater treatment plant stratford ontario canada degasified and incubated for the period of one week prior to testing the test was conducted using an automatic methane potential test system ampts ii bioprocess control sweden unit triplicate reactors were filled with thickened ppb biomass as substrate 50 ml ads as inoculum 25 ml and diluted with distilled water to a total volume of 350 ml in 500 ml reactors the ratio of initial substrate to inoculum s x was fixed at 2 0 g cod g cod and the test was conducted at mesophilic temperature 37 c mixing was performed intermittently and the test was continued for 30 days consecutively blanks containing only inoculum were included and monitored in the experiment and hence the background biogas https www sciencedirect com topics earth and planetary sciences gas productionproduced by inoculum itself was deducted from the total gas generated in each reactor bottles were initially flushed with n2 gas for 3 min 1 l min at the start of the test incubation temperature was 37 c using the thermostatic water bath no external nutrients alkalinity or https www sciencedirect com topics earth and planetary sciences trace elementchemicals were added to the reactors before or during the bmp test and no pre treatment method was applied to enhance the ppb biomass biodegradability the characteristics of the ppb biomass and the inoculum are summarized in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 ppb fed batch tests inoculum generation the scod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations in the fed batch tests were measured for a period of 20 days supplementary information the low scod nh4 n and po4 3 p removal efficiencies of 12 9 and 15 respectively on day 8 were due to the inadequate ppb culture at the beginning of the fed batch tests days 1 8 on day 20 the scod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations were measured at 134 13 and 1 2 mg l respectively corresponding to the scod nh4 n and po4 3 p removal efficiencies of 66 57 and 65 3 2 photobioreactor operation and optimization during the start up the average effluent tcod tn and tp concentrations were 137 82 mg l 15 6 mg l and 1 5 1 mg l respectively corresponding to tcod tn and tp removal efficiencies of 77 62 and 73 steady state effluent tcod tn and tp concentrations as well as tcod tn and tp removal efficiencies are summarized in table 4 the temporal cod n and p variations are illustrated in fig 3 supplementary information file the effluent substrate concentrations were below target limits of 50 mgcod l 10 mgn l and 1 mgp l during periods 2 6 when ethanol was dosed at an average concentration of 260 mgcod l these results showed ppb s high potential for municipal wastewater treatment at ir light irradiance of as low as 1 4 w m2 in periods 1 6 the average tcod tn tp uptake ratio by ppb at steady state was 100 6 1 however this ratio decreased to 100 4 5 0 59 during period 7 when the panmbr was operated in light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h the photobioreactor s color changed from red to purple in period 7 indicating that the ppb culture in light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h was different than the ppb culture in periods 1 6 full light steady state mass balances in periods 4 and 6 at the minimum hrt of 9 h showed cod mass closure of 82 4 and 81 3 tn mass closure of 86 4 and 83 2 as well as tp mass closure of 83 4 and 81 1 respectively the average cod tn and tp mass closures were 81 3 85 2 and 83 2 in period 1 84 1 83 3 and 84 4 in period 2 85 3 86 1 and 86 2 in period 3 as well as 81 4 82 3 and 81 4 in period 5 respectively in periods 2 6 the average effluent cod n and p concentrations were 37 mg l 6 mg l and 0 62 mg l respectively the high effluent nitrogen concentration of 24 mg l removal efficiency of 44 in period 1 was due to insufficient carbon the nitrogen removal efficiency increased significantly to more than 80 with the addition of ethanol in periods 2 6 the photobioreactor s operation at different hrts 9 36 h had no substantial effect on tcod removal efficiencies 92 effluent n and p concentrations increased in both periods 4 and 6 when the hrt decreased from 18 h to 9 h the temporal variation of the cod n p uptake ratio by ppb in periods 1 6 is depicted in fig 3 it is evident from fig 3 that the ratio of cod n p uptake by the ppb was consistently stable throughout the study irrespective of change in hrt and light irradiance at 3 and 1 4 w m2 in period 7 when the photobioreactor was operated in the light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h the average effluent nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations were 11 and 1 8 mg l respectively however the average effluent cod concentration was 43 mg l the high effluent phosphorous concentration in this period was due to the release of phosphorous from the ppb biofilm formed on the membrane table ii supplementary information shows a comparison of the scod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations in the photobioreactor and the membrane permeate final effluent the average po4 3 p concentration in the photobioreactor was 0 49 0 2 mg l which was significantly lower than the effluent phosphorous concentration of the samples taken from the membrane permeate 1 8 0 3 mg l the scod nh4 n and po4 3 p analysis of the samples taken from the membrane permeate and from the photobioreactor at days 103 108 indicated that 1 4 mg po4 3 p l was released from the ppb biofilm on the membrane which significantly decreased the ppb performance with respect to phosphorous removal in period 7 based on table ii si the average effluent scod and nh4 n concentrations were 43 and 9 mg l respectively however the scod and nh4 n concentrations of the filtered samples taken from the panmbr were 55 and 10 mg l respectively a paired t test was conducted to compare scod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations in the panmbr and the membrane permeate final effluent to evaluate the effect of the membrane on the scod nh4 n and po4 3 p removal efficiencies and the ppb performance based on the results of the t test there were statistically significant differences in the scod nh4 n and po4 3 p specifically cod decreased by 14 4 mg l nitrogen decreased by 1 0 7 mg l and phosphorous increased by 1 3 0 3 mgp l uncertainty in means expressed at the 95 ci for a paired t test two tailed p values for these differences were 0 0001 0 001 and 0 0001 respectively the simultaneous cod uptake and phosphorous release in this period indicates the accumulation of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos on the membrane during the light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h because the ratio of cod uptake to p release was 9 3 1 close to typical ratio of 10 1 for paos metcalf and eddy 2004 however there was no phosphorus released from the ppb biomass under full illumination periods 1 6 these results suggest that in the absence of light the energy required for ppb growth is potentially obtained from the release of stored polyphosphate from the ppb biomass ppb released the stored polyphosphate to produce energy when they were incubated under insufficient light tinsley and gotschlich 1995 lai et al 2017 indicated that when the energy source was removed ppb released intracellular polyphosphate to generate energy for growth it was noted that when the light source was removed the ratio of cod uptake to p release was 10 0 77 lai et al 2017 the photobioreactor s mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss during periods 1 7 are depicted in fig 4 the range of mlss and mlvss in periods 1 7 varied from 290 to 1250 mg l and from 240 to 1090 mg l respectively which were correlated with the hrt the average ratio of mlvss to mlss was 0 85 0 05 which was stable during periods 1 7 biomass yields were 0 49 0 52 0 50 and 0 55 gvss gcod in periods 1 2 3 and 4 respectively ir irradiance of 3 w m2 at 1 4 w m2 the yields were 0 46 and 0 47 gvss gcod in periods 5 and 6 respectively the yield was calculated using the linear correlation between cumulative vss production ppb biomass wasted daily and cumulative cod removal the potential methanogenesis at low light intensity may be the reason for the slightly lower 10 yields at 1 4 w m2 in comparison with the yields at 3 w m2 3 3 microbial growth the results of the optical density od tests at light irradiances of 3 and 1 4 w m2 as well as the light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h at the ir light irradiance of 1 4 w m2 are depicted in fig 5 the od tests were carried out when the photobioreactor was operated at hrt and srt of 18 h and 5 days respectively in periods 3 and 5 the od tests were also conducted at an hrt of 9 h and the srt of 5 days in period 7 during the light dark cycles the od profile of the samples taken from the photobioreactor at the above mentioned light irradiances showed the presence of bacteriochlorophyll pigments with three peaks at 590 800 and 860 nm and the presence of carotenoid pigments with two peaks at 460 and 488 nm these results are consistent with ppb s absorbance behaviour which shows a similar trend with peaks attributed to the above mentioned pigments cohen bazire et al 1957 according to fig 5 od values for the sample grown at 1 4 w m2 were 4 0 4 1 3 5 and 3 9 respectively at wavelengths of 460 488 800 and 860 nm however od results for the panmbr s sample grown at 3 w m2 were determined to be 4 3 4 3 3 1 and 3 4 at wavelengths of 460 488 800 and 860 nm respectively relatively higher od values at 800 and 860 nm for ppb grown at light irradiance of 1 4 w m2 showed a higher production of the bacteriochlorophyll pigments due to the adaptation of the ppb to low light irradiances however the higher od values at 460 and 488 nm for the ppb grown under the light irradiance of 3 w m2 indicated that the amount of carotenoid pigments increased with higher light irradiances which is consistent with the literature zhou et al 2014 bacteriochlorophyll pigments play a major role in the ppb structure to harvest light and energy required for growth in period 7 od values for the sample taken from the photobioreactor at light dark cycles of 2 h 2 h were 7 7 7 6 6 1 and 6 1 respectively at wavelengths of 460 488 800 and 860 nm fig 5 3 4 monod kinetic parameters monod kinetic parameters in the batch tests at the low ir light irradiance of 3 w m2 were determined by solving monod equations in matlab matlab r2017a the mathworks inc natick ma monod kinetic parameters km and y were determined to be 1 9 0 09 mgcod mgvss d and 0 38 0 09 mgvss mgcod respectively 95 ci the correlation coefficient r of parameters km and y was 0 5 and had a fairly narrow confidence interval ks and kd were assumed to be 20 mgcod l and 0 09 d 1 puyol et al 2017 the comparisons between the theoretical and experimental substrate removal and cell growth depicted in fig 6 a b the average absolute percentages of the discrepancy between experimental data and monod fit for substrate s removal and cell x growth were 4 and 3 respectively which demonstrates the accuracy of the model parameters table 5 summarizes the ppb monod kinetic parameters by comparing these parameters with the parameters obtained at high ir light irradiance puyol et al 2017 dalaei et al 2019 it appears that ppb yield biomass specific substrate utilization rates and maximum specific growth rate μmax at the ir irradiance of 3 w m2 were slightly lower than the ppb kinetics at irradiance of 50 w m2 reported by dalaei et al 2019 and approximately half those reported by puyol et al 2017 the reduced yield indicates alternative carbon and electron sinks the decrease in uptake rate is naturally due to the lower light input which means that light input rather than substrate input is limiting uptake the reduction in yield of 40 from 0 63 to 0 39 was likely related to this reduced uptake rate phototrophs were no longer able to outcompete methanogens and hence a large proportion of the substrate was lost to methanogenic activity than has not been observed at higher irradiation levels the main energy inputs for the photobioreactor are lighting and mixing energy for membrane scouring the mixing energy was determined to be 0 15 kwh m3 hülsen et al 2017 high light irradiance of 50 w m2 was utilized to evaluate the ppb s viability in municipal wastewater treatment using continuous flow photobioreactor dalaei et al 2019 hülsen et al 2016 the high energy consumption 24 kwh m3 for the above mentioned light irradiance challenges the practical application of the ppb technology based on the results of this study excellent ppb performance with respect to cod n and p removal was achieved at light irradiances of 3 and 1 4 w m2 which significantly decreased energy consumption for lighting to 1 44 and 0 67 kwh m3 these results expand the potential of the ppb technology for municipal wastewater treatment using a membrane photobioreactor reducing light energy by up to 97 3 5 anaerobic digestion and methane production from ppb biomass the methane production from the ppb biomass grown under low light irradiance from municipal wastewater is shown in fig 7 the time course of methane production fitted the first order model very well with a methane yield of 142 nmlch4 gcodadded 240 nmlch4 gvssadded based on the observed cod vss ratio for ppb of 1 7 with a first order rate coefficient of 0 12 d 1 the average methane production rate at 37 c was 0 017 mlch4 mgvss d samples of the digested sludge in the bmp test were characterized for nutrients solids and cod both in particulate and soluble fractions the nutrient release potentials during anaerobic digestion were calculated by comparing the particulate nutrient contents of the digested sludge with the nutrients in the fresh sludge used in the bmp reactors the overall anaerobic biodegradability of the ppb biomass was roughly 41 another concern with the anaerobic digestion of ppb biomass used as substrate for nutrient removal is the considerable release of nutrients solubilization was defined as the difference in soluble nitrogen or phosphorus concentrations between before and after digestion divided by their respective initial particulate concentrations by measuring the total soluble and particulate fractions of the nutrients normalized to the total and volatile solids present in the reactor 1840 mg l and 1160 mg l respectively as shown in table 6 nutrients release during anaerobic digestion were calculated at 22 mgnh4 n gvs added and 5 mgtp gvs added during the process these values account for 27 and 36 of particulate n and particulate p solubilization respectively table 6 the methane yield of 240 mlch4 gvssadded from the anaerobic digestion of ppb biomass was comparable with the methane yield of 218 nmlch4 gvs from the anaerobic digestion of the waste activated sludge was reported by filer et al 2019 these results showed that the biomethane potential of the ppb biomass was comparable to the biomethane potential of was using the methane yield of 240 nmlch4 gvssadded the rate of wasted ppb biomass from the panmbr of 0 06 l d with the vss of 6 2 g l the treated wastewater flowrate of 0 0052 m3 d at 9 h hrt and 35 8 mj m3ch4 the energy recovered for ppb digestion is 0 17 kwh m3 of wastewater treated based on the energy consumption of 0 33 0 67 kwh m3 attributed to the photobioreactor s illumination in periods 6 7 the net energy consumption required for municipal wastewater treatment by ppb was determined to be 0 16 0 5 kwh m3 this is comparable with the energy consumption of the traditional wastewater treatment plants of 0 47 0 2 kwh m3 gurung et al 2018 crawford and sandino 2010 and goldstein and smith 2002 also indicated that the required energy consumption for traditional wastewater treatment plants was 0 37 kwh m3 3 6 estimation of full scale energy cost of ppb considering the results obtained from this study external carbon must be added to adjust the cod n ratio of municipal wastewater to 100 6 using typical values the energy and supplemental carbon costs for a 1 mld plant were evaluated as shown in this study with a typical medium strength wastewater characteristic an average external carbon concentration of 260 mgcod l corresponding to 40 gallons of ethanol per day was required to achieve an effluent nitrogen concentration below the target limit of 10 mg l this challenges the economic feasibility of ppb technology when nitrogen removal from wastewater is critical as the cost of the external carbon source and its transportation and storage increase debarbadillo et al 2008 assessment of new options and technologies to reduce the use of an external carbon source is critical the fermentation of sludge is one of the methods that can generate readily biodegradable carbon source for denitrification processes elefsiniotis et al 2004 fig 8 shows the overall scheme of a case study conducted to further investigate the energy requirement for a 1 mld capacity wastewater treatment plant using ppb technology it should be mentioned that only the major energy demands ignoring the energy for primary treatment membrane in secondary treatment i e pumping and fouling control biosolids thickening and dewatering and recovery through anaerobic digestion have been considered in these calculations some assumptions were made to simplify the model as shown in the flow diagram depicted in fig 8 to evaluate the potential use of internal carbon source by generating volatile fatty acids vfa through sludge fermentation and the capacity for energy recovery through anaerobic digestion using both primary sludge after fermentation as well as ppb sludge the following assumptions were made suspended solids removal efficiency through primary clarifier is 70 raw wastewater contains 160 mgvss l medium strength the average vfa yield for primary sludge fermentation is 143 mgvfa gvss in the feed peces et al 2016 the average methane production yield for ppb waste sludge is 240 nmlch4 gvssadded based on bmp measurements conducted in the present study the average methane production yield for primary sludge after fermentation is 260 nmlch4 gvs peces et al 2016 the cod equivalent of ethanol is 2 09 gcod gethanol and cod equivalent for volatile fatty acids is assumed to be 1 1 gcod gvfa the density of ethanol and average vfas are 800 and 1000 kg m3 respectively based on the above mentioned assumptions 18 kgvfa d can be generated from the primary sludge fermentation this is significantly lower than the required cod of 260 kgcod d for a 1 mld plant however the fermentation of the primary sludge can reduce the use of the external carbon source by roughly 7 the external required cod concentration of 260 mg cod l is equivalent to 124 l ethanol for a 1 mld plant table 7 summarizes the estimated operating energy and chemical costs for 1 mld plant using ppb technology interestingly the total energy demand of the ppb bioreactor of 1 73 gj d 480 kwh d is almost satisfied by the methane energy generated of 1 7 gj d implying that the ppb treatment at the optimized light irradiance and with alternate light dark cycle of 2h 2h can be energy neutral with a net energy consumption of 0 03 gj d or 0 008 kwh m3 of wastewater sensitivity analysis showed that the net energy consumption for the panmbr using ppb were 0 43 gj d 0 115 kwh m3 and 0 4 gj d 0 107 kwh m3 corresponding to anaerobic ppb biomass degradabilities of 30 and 50 respectively as shown in table 7 the methane energy generated recovers almost a fifth the mixing and illumination energy cost of the ppb bioreactor the overall cost of ppb technology for the treatment of municipal wastewater in a 1 mld plant was determined to be 94 d predominantly for external carbon requirements and illumination energy based on table 7 the value of the 50 m3 methane generated from the digestion of ppb biomass and fermented primary sludge ps can reduce the ppb operating costs by 10 4 summary and conclusions the results of this study demonstrate the potential of the purple phototrophic bacteria ppb in treating municipal wastewater at ir light irradiance of as low as 1 4 w m2 an order of magnitude lower than previously assessed yield was slightly lower at 0 38 kgvss kgcod kinetic parameters were lower than previous analysis at high irradiation levels higher production of bacteriochlorophyll at lower light irradiance of 1 4 w m2 indicated that ppb can adapt its structure to low light irradiances to generate sufficient energy for growth although using this low light input can achieve near parity with energy gained from anaerobic digestion of primary sludge and ppb the need for external carbon remains making photo assimilative treatment of domestic wastewater economically challenging the major findings are 1 anaerobic phototrophic municipal wastewater treatment with ppb can achieve average effluent cod n and p concentrations of below 37 mg l 6 mg l and 0 62 mg l respectively with an external cod addition 260 mg l at low ir irradiances of 3 and 1 4 w m2 2 the net energy consumption for municipal wastewater treatment by ppb was determined to be 0 5 and 0 16 kwh m3 under full illumination 1 4 w m2 and with light dark cycle of 2 h 2 h 1 4 w m2 respectively using harvested energy from the anaerobic digestion of ppb biomass with anaerobic digestion of both primary sludge and ppb biomass the net energy consumption of the ppb bioreactor at 1 4 w m2 and with light dark cycle of 2 h 2 h is only 0 008 kwh m3 3 monod kinetic parameters km and y were determined to be 1 9 mgcod mgvss d 0 38 mgvss mgcod respectively at the low light irradiance of 3 w m2 it must be asserted however that although the results of this study indicate that from an energy perspective the panmbr can be competitive with activated sludge there are many scale up challenges facing the technology these include but are not limited to light transmissivity in large deep reactors with much lower specific surface area than used in this study membrane fouling impact of membrane cleaning agents on ppb activity potential methane generation with the associated health and safety requirements supplemental carbon requirements

hydrometeorological extremes ipcc 2014 aalbers et al 2018 martel et al 2019 innocenti et al 2019 sillmann et al 2013 fischer and knutti 2016 recent data from the centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters shows that floods alone accounted for over 47 of weather related disasters in the period between 1995 and 2015 centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters cred and united nations office for disaster risk reduction unisdr 2015 population growth and uncontrolled building on flood plains are two factors attributed to the increasing vulnerability to extreme weather events despite the growing global awareness as depicted by several reports by the world bank ipcc european commission and un moving towards more flood resilient cities leandro 2015 has proven a major challenge in both developing and developed countries vis et al 2003 this transition to a resilience approach focused on flexible adaptable solutions clearly requires a departure from the traditional resistance based approach focused on flood safe solutions in flood risk management tempels and hartmann 2014 in this paper we present a method for measuring climate change adaptation of cities based on a quantifiable and scalable flood resilience index fri there are more than 70 definitions of flood resilience fisher 2015 these vary between two extremes resilience as the ability of a system to bounce back after stress or as the ability of groups or communities to cope with external stresses adger 2000 conceptually it is viewed as a quality measure which is degraded over time it has a first phase in which the community experiences a more or less sudden loss of resilience during the event phase and a recovery phase in which the community is expected to bounce back or re establish its normal performance bruneau et al 2003 however in water domain less than one quarter of all publications 21 on resilience actually focus on cities from which the vast majority is linked to system reliability rodina 2019 or system performance roach et al 2018 ahn and choi 2013 gersonius et al 2012 wang et al 2019 dong et al 2017 because of difficulties in operationalizing concepts few studies mathematically define resilience of a community in terms of its ability to absorb recover from and adapt to adverse flooding as defined by the us national academies national research council 2012 oladokun and montz 2018 overcome this difficulty by defining three factors namely hazard absorption capacity resource availability and resource utilization processes which are then compared against respective threshold values most studies on quantifying resilience develop indicators indices for measuring the characteristics of a city or a community to address different resilience dimensions this approach is able to reveal the relative position magnitude and direction of change of a community s resilience in face of a disaster the city resilience index applies 4 dimensions 12 goals and 52 indicators arup international development 2012 the four dimensions are health and well being economy and society infrastructure and environment and leadership and strategy the 52 indicators identify the critical factors at city scale that contribute towards the 12 goals set for each city miguez and vero 2016 proposed the flood resilience index fresi it contains 7 indicators including flood properties and social factors such as number of people income and inadequate sanitation the fresi is built to support decision making by comparing the value difference between present and future scenarios batica and gourbesville 2016 developed a city fri applying five dimensions social economic institutional physical and natural the evaluation is done with a set of 91 indicators which describe the physical and social attributes of an urban system the resulting fri can be visualized along those five dimensions all previous studies have in common that the resulting fri is not time dependent and it is assessed at city scale in fact most indicators and assessment frameworks are not fully satisfactory at household level jones et al 2018 these frameworks tend to focus primarily on systems institutions and policies that deliver resilience and not on the people and the resources available to them bahadur and pichon 2016 furthermore most analysis are done based on time horizons past present future sharifi 2016 but rarely as event based chen and leandro 2019 time dependent studies focus on a specific system s performance to quantify resilience either the surface or the drainage system mugume et al 2014 dong et al 2017 or on damage functions lee and kim 2017 in those cases recovery phase is complete and resilience returns to its original status once flooding recedes this paper investigates a method for assessing climate change adaptation based on an event based scalable flood resilience index fri the fri considers three dimensions of resilience physical social and economic unlike previous studies the developed fri is quantifiable at household level and it is time dependent making suitable its aggregation to higher scales scalable household resilience to climate change is defined as the capacity of a household to withstand adverse effects following extreme flooding events and the ability to recover to the household original conditions as such we limit the definition of resilience to two phases event and recovery 2 study area and data maxvorstadt is one of the 25 boroughs in the city of munich germany it consists of the 9 districts königsplatz augustenstraβe st benno marsfeld josephsplatz am alten nördlichen friedhof universität schönfeldvorstadt and massmannbergl fig 1 69 of the borough area is occupied by buildings the vast majority of the surface area is sealed with only 7 occupied by green areas highest elevations are found in the west part of maxvorstadt 580 m and lowest in the east 510 m this is a relatively flat area of munich and therefore it is at risk of flooding for extreme rainfall events the present average annual precipitation is about 944 mm which is higher than the national average of 700 mm maxvorstadt is a typical academic area with population typically ranging between 20 and 30 years old for that reason the children and elderly population is relatively low when compared with other boroughs table 1 presents the number of buildings and social indicators for each district in maxvorstadt due to data scarcity annual household income was assumed constant and equal to 57 000 for all districts in maxvorstadt the latter value corresponds to an estimated average income in munich 1 1 sources payscale estimates the average salary in munich to be 56k salary explorer and merkur tz redaktions gmbh co kg cites gehalt de estimate it to be 59k 3 methods 3 1 climate change and household adaptation 3 1 1 climate change and baseline scenarios in this study future rainfall is predicted based on the crcm5 large ensemble crcm5 le with a spatial resolution of 0 11 approx 12 km and a temporal resolution of 1 hr under the most extreme representative concentration pathway rcp8 5 leduc et al 2019 rainfall scenarios are split into four time periods of 30 years interval 1980 2009 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 the former is termed baseline scenario and the latter three are the future climate change scenarios based on the crcm5 le the base scenario is taken from kostra rainfall data as produced by the german weather service dwd der deutsche wetterdiesnt 2017 this is a raster data base of rainfall intensity duration curves for the whole germany in 8 5 8 5 km2 the crcm5 le consists of 50 equally likely climate realizations of present and future climate based on the large number of model years 1500 years per 30 year period the future change of rainfall intensities with long return periods 100 years can be estimated future rainfall intensities with durations greater than 1 hr and return periods ranging from one to 100 years were estimated by determining the empirical quantiles since un corrected precipitation data from the crcm5 le which is normal for regional climate models is used the data shows some biases in order to overcome the large effort of bias adjusting the original hourly data the delta change approach hay et al 2000 is applied to the kostra rainfall data the delta change approach allows several rainfall intensities to be derived for different rainfall durations and return periods this approach is based on a factor which is the percentage changed between the future values c r c m 5 s c t and the baseline c r c m 5 b a s e l i n e t by multiplying this factor f s c t with the idf curves intensity duration frequency derived from observed data from kostra i k o s t r a t the climate change scenarios i s c t for different return periods t are obtained 1 i s c t i k o s t r a t f s c t in which f s c t is given by 2 f s c t 1 c r c m 5 s c t c r c m 5 b a s e l i n e t c r c m 5 b a s e l i n e t additionally sub hourly intensities of the idf curve derived from the crcm5 le are linearly extrapolated down to 15 min duration 3 1 2 household adaptation household flood volume is based on a one way coupling it is assumed that the flooded volume inside the building is much smaller than the flood volume outside therefore only the indoor water depths are affected by the household adaptations in this case flooding of the household is allowed once the water levels outside the building exceeds the door ground elevation resilience of the household can be improved via redundancy or flexibility measures mugume et al 2015 the former includes the addition of storage facilities and the latter the design of flood proofing options herein a mixed solution is use for enhancing the climate adaptive capacity of the household a flood proof gate is installed at the door to prevent the floodwater from entering the building and a flood tank is built inside the building to temporarily store possible water overtopping the flood gate in this case a submersible pump is activated with constant flow rate r pump which is turned off once the flood tank volume returns to zero the volume t and water depths inside of the household h in t are given by 3 t t 1 f l u x t s c e l l t 1 4 h in t t area area m2 is the building area s m 2 i s the total storage volume of the tank f l u x t is the water volume entering exiting the building given by 5 flux t s i g n h o u t h i n 2 3 c d l 2 g h o u t h i n 3 2 r p u m p 1000 δ t δ t s is the computation time interval c d 0 6 is the discharge coefficient l 0 75 m is the door width h out is the water depth outside of the household r pump is the pumping rate l s cell t m s is the water volume inside the underground flood tank given by 6 cell t m i n s cell t 1 flux t flux t 0 m a x 0 cell t 1 flux t flux t 0 t 1 0 with this adaptive strategy flooding in the household only occurs once the storage capacity of the flood tank is exceeded cell t s cellar tanks may vary between 0 5 and 3 5 m3 flood proof gates may vary between 10 and 30 cm in this case study a flood proof gate of 10 cm with flood tank of 3 m3 and a pump rate of 5 l s is selected a submersible pump is used to make the solution more resilient also to higher water depth events 3 2 scalable fri flood resilience index the scalable fri is time variable and quantified at the household level as such it is easier to aggregate it to higher scales without loss of information three scales are proposed in this study borough the large scale corresponding to the whole area of maxvorstadt in munich f r i district the intermediate scale which aggregates the fri into 9 grouped elements f r i d each containing h n households see table 1 and the household level which includes 5573 individual elements f r i h for each scale the average fri f r i the 95 confidence interval ci 95 the minimum fri m i n f r i and the fri duration can be calculated see fig 2 7 f r i t 1 9 d 1 9 f r i d t f r i d t 1 h n h 1 h n f r i h t the fri at the household level f r i h is time variable and includes indicators reflecting three resilience dimensions namely physical social and economic it is calculated as a compound equation which distinguishes between event t t s t e and recovery phase t t e 8 f r i h t w f y i y t w f y t t s t e f r i h t 1 r f t t e rf is the recovery factor given by 9 r f i x w f x 0 001 w f x w f y and i y are the event phase weighting factors and indicators of y namely total flooding depth h accumulated water depth a w d flood duration d and the water accumulation rate w a r during the event phase only physically based indicators derived from the flood modelling are considered w f x and i x are the recovery phase weighting factors and indicators of x namely flood severity f s total flooding depth t f d total flooding time t f t maximum water accumulation rate w a r m a x household with children c elderly population e household income i the first four take into account the physical characteristics of the flood event the latter three enable the consideration of social and economic characteristics of each household structure affecting the recovery phase which is only initiated once the flooding has receded h 0 the contribution of the social and economic factors to the recovery phase is limited by thresholds c ref e ref and i r e f for example we assume that having an income larger than i r e f 80 000 cannot further positively impact your recovery time w f determines the relative weight of each indicator the event phase factors w f h w f a w d w f d and w f w a r are assigned 3 1 3 and 2 the recovery factors w f f s w f t f d w f t f t w f w a r m a x w f c w f e and w f i are assigned 3 1 2 1 1 2 and 3 respectively the former factors allow us to give different weights to the 4 physical indicators in the event phase while the latter allow us to weight the social and economic indicators differently in the recovery phase all indicators vary both in time t and in space spatial variability in the physical indicators is a function of the simulated water depths and in the socio and economic indicators is a function of the district see table 1 as any index the developed fri cannot include all aspects that play a role in the three dimensions considered the fri aims to make and inference considering indirect relations established by its indicators miguez and vero 2016 for example by reducing the indoor water depths the adaption measures studied herein act directly in all physically based indicators event and recovery phases the lower the indoor water depth the less severe is the flooding in each time the more resilient the system becomes h increases and f s recovers faster the accumulated water depth provides an indicator of the full scope of the impact that a household can withstand which is related with the maximum accumulated h in a w d increases and t f d recovers faster the lower the duration of the flood the less damages it will cause d increases t f t recovers faster these include physical damages but also health impacts due to the reduced exposure to water borne and vector borne diseases the water rising rate will be also reduced hence this will impact positively to the resilience particularly during evacuation of people or rescue of goods those actions will be allowed more time to be completed w a r increases and w a r m a x recovers faster parameters in the social and economic indicators are assigned according with the different districts of maxvorstadt and are therefore not affected by the adaptation measures a summary of all indicators are presented in table 2 further details including a sensitivity analysis on the parameters can be found in chen and leandro 2019 3 3 p dwave parallel diffusive wave model the flood inundation model parallel diffusive wave p dwave is the surface overland flow model applied in this study it is a first order finite volume explicit discretization scheme that neglects the inertial terms in 2d shallow water equations the governing equations are described by 10 dh dt uh r 11 g h

results in benchmark tests can be found in leandro et al 2014 p dwave has been also applied validated against other shallow water equation models in urban areas in the uk martins et al 2017 and in germany leandro et al 2016 pflugbeil et al 2019 4 results 4 1 climate change scenarios the temporal dowscalling of rainfall intensity down to 15 min durations are plotted in fig 3 by using the delta change approach several rainfall intensities are derived for different rainfall durations and return periods ranging from 1 to 100 years it can be seen that the rainfall intensity increases with the return period and with the increase of the future periods within rcp8 5 for the sake of simplicity we will focus the next sections of this study on the results using rainfall corresponding to a 100 year return period and 15 min duration the rainfall intensity values are in this case equal to 132 4 132 5 168 7 and 175 6 mm h for the four time periods 1980 2009 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 respectively 4 2 flood inundation modelling with and without household adaptation measures the flood inundation results are plotted in fig 4 a the downscaled 15 min rainfall intensity with 100 year return period is applied to the p dwave model to simulate the flood inundation for each of the four time periods it can be seen that the flood inundation increases with the timeline the average water depth on the streets for each of the time periods is equal to 11 10 11 12 14 00 and 14 53 cm because we assumed a one way coupling the household adaptation measures do not impact the water depths on the streets in theory a two way coupling would be more precise in this case the flood volume on the streets should be slightly less depending on the volume of water entering the buildings since the maximum relative difference between the volumes of water of all tanks and the volume of water at the surface is smaller than 4 5 we deemed this assumption as acceptable the maximum indoor water depths of each building with and without adaptation measures are plotted in fig 4b and c respectively in this study the same household adaptation measure was adopted for all buildings namely a flood proof gate of 10 cm with flood tank of 3 m3 and a submersible pump rate of 5 l s the indoor water depths of the buildings are aggregated and displayed in steps of 10 cm as such it is easier to evaluate the impact of the adaption measure for example the impact in the first time period is clearly seen by the increase in the number of buildings with indoor water depths in the range of 0 10 cm cyan which jumps from 2 to 68 with a corresponding decrease in the percentage of the higher water depths ranges for water depths higher than 20 cm the adaption measure is no longer efficient the efficiency of the adaptation measures would in any case improve for smaller return periods for which the tank and pump are still able to cope with the indoor flooded water 4 3 scalable flood resilience index this section demonstrates the main attractive features of the resilience curves calculated based on the flood resilience index fri namely its scalability and time variance fig 5 shows three levels of aggregation of the resilience curves for each time period including a single building fig 5a the district of königsplatz fig 5b and the whole maxvorstadt fig 5c it is clear the impact of the household adaptation measures at each level in increasing the fri closer to 1 0 or reducing the recovery time by inspection of the dashed with adaptation and solid without adaptation lines since scenario four is the most extreme 2070 2099 we will focus on this last time period hereafter the resilience curves at district level are further illustrated in fig 6 herein the resilience curves are further aggregated inside each district depending on their behaviour similar behaviours can be identified via a correlation analysis buildings with similar resilience curves i e a correlation coefficient higher than 0 5 are aggregated to generate the 95 confidence interval ci 95 depending on the correlation coefficients of each building s resilience curves it was possible to identify and aggregate the curves in either three similar groups district id 1 and 4 two groups id 2 8 and 9 or one single group id 3 5 6 and 7 inside each district focusing on the effect of the adaptation measures it is possible to display the district maps highlighting the households which now retain the fri equal to 1 0 and the ones that do not fig 7 the latter do experience an improvement through the application of the adaptation measures however there is still some loss of resilience being observed the results of the effect of applying adaptation measures are summarized in table 3 for each district and whole maxvorstadt the effect in terms of total fri duration average fri duration and minimum average fri are presented these are the results of the aggregated resilience curves in addition the maximum average indoor water depth h in and its average duration are also displayed in bold are the benefits of the adaption measure highlighted for the most hit district for example district id 4 has the highest total fri duration of 109 3 h after adaptation this value drops to 46 4 h even though it still remains the highest value of all districts it experiences an improvement close to 60 it is also interesting to notice that the highest impact value found before and after the adaption does not always correspond to the same district for easiness light and dark grey highlight the lowest and highest impact value obtained by a district respectively this clearly reflects the dynamic nature of the flood simulations which is captured by the flood resilience index 5 discussion 5 1 climate change scenarios the results obtained by the crcm5 le for munich clearly show an increase of the rainfall intensity across all range of durations and return periods driven by climate change this is inline with the majority of studies of future scenarios including climate change dong et al 2017 the highest rate of change is obtained in the transition from the second 2010 2039 to the third period 2040 2069 the highest absolute values are found in the last period 2070 2099 a similar behaviour is therefore also observed in 15 min downscaled rainfall intensity values obtained by the delta change approach this supports the argument that germany and in particular munich is also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change bender et al 2017 particularly in what concerns flooding from short duration high intensity rainfall heavy rainfall as highlighted in this study in any case it needs to be recognized that this is not a comprehensive climate change study for example an ensemble of climate model projections was not considered this study highlights in any case a likely extreme scenario for the city of munich 5 2 flood inundation modelling with and without flood measures maxvorstadt ground elevations vary between 580 and 510 m highest elevations are found in the west area generating a main flow direction towards east however and since maxvorstadt is a relatively flat area several areas experience ponding of water varying from few centimetres up to half a meter therefore the impact of the climate adaption measure is bound by the height of the ponding and the duration of the flooding next to areas surrounding each building the flood proof gate is able to retain the household dry up to 10 cm of water depth once this value is reached the flood proof gate starts to overflow at this point the flood tank begins to fill up while the flooded water is pumped out of the building depending on the duration of the overflow the tank pump system might keep the household dry diminish the duration and height of the indoor water depth or have negligible impact on the household flooding therefore the impact in areas which experienced heights above 20 cm red colour in fig 4 is limited whereas for heights below that the impact can be high to medium after in field observations it has been observed that electrical cables are laid underground and are therefore not susceptible to flooding within the study area there is a water proof medium voltage power station connected to numerous intermediate nodes buses the bus transformers from medium to low voltage supplying the households are nominally raised 30 cm above the ground surface on a cement platform if water raises above that height the power supply for the group of households supplied by it may fail since we did not focus our study on energy supply it was assumed that no power cuts could occur during flooding nevertheless the adaptation measure suggested herein could be easily equipped with a back up battery power option to keep operating in the event of power outage in our study we assumed that the adaptation measures were installed in all buildings nevertheless it would be possible to assign spatially variable adaption measures this would be necessary in case studies with limited budget e g poorer households for the application of such measures or in case an optimisation strategy would be sought households which experience flooding without adaptation strategies would see their fri unchanged since we adopted a one way coupling between flood simulation and indoor water depth see section 3 1 however we did not follow optimisation strategies in our study because of the high average income of the households in munich and in order to keep our focus on the scalability of the fri in measuring climate change impact here it should be noted that for the simulation of the flood propagation we did not consider the sewer system the sewer system would have drained part of the ponding water and reduced the maximum water depths since the water would remain in the surface indefinitely the resilience recovery phase could not be initiated in order to allow the recovery phase to take place flood inundation water is removed after 1 hr of simulation time in terms of maximum inundation extent produced by the 100 years return period the impact of neglecting the sewer system is in any case likely small according with the german standard en752 the design rainfall for sewer systems considers a rainfall with duration of 15min and return period between 5 and 20 years 5 3 scalable flood resilience index the flood resilience index is scalable it can be visualized at household level fig 5a district fig 5b and maxvorstadt fig 5c at household level it is represented by a single line whereas at the other two levels it is better visualized by its average fri f r i and 95 confidence interval ci 95 adaptation measures can be fit for each household or derived at different aggregation levels it is therefore more flexible than alternative fri miguez and vero 2016 batica and gourbesville 2016 which do not allow the household levels to be individualized fig 5a clearly shows the impact of the climate adaption measure in a single building in maxvorstadt recovery time is more than halved across all time periods studied the ci 95 of the resilience curve for the district of königsplatz displays a large band which emphasises the different behaviour of the individual buildings in that district the ability to aggregate the results according to different criteria is one of the advantages of our approach the ci 95 of the aggregated resilience curves based on district level and correlation between single resilience curves highlights that there are buildings with similar behaviour inside each district visually it can be represented in coloured maps which facilitate decision makes in making a city more resilient to climate change for example in district id 1 königsplatz fig 6 the blue buildings show a higher impact in the event phase than in the recovery phase on the contrary the yellow buildings show both a higher impact in the event and the recovery phase cleary the buildings in yellow should be given higher priority district id 8 schönfeldvorstadt show some buildings with very small minimum fri but also some buildings achieving a fri 1 0 after the implementation of the adaptation measures in fact 57 of all affected buildings inside maxvorstadt were able to improve their fr to 1 0 after applying the adaptation measure it is therefore also possible to aggregate based on resilience curves with reduced fri fig 6 buildings in id 4 marsfeld show the longest recovery phase of all districts with 46 4 h table 3 this district has the highest percentage of elderly in maxvorstadt which emphasises the contribution from the elderly population indicator e in addition this indicator was given a medium weight w f e of 2 the double of the weight w f c for the indicator of the household with children c as such we emphasise the disparity of the former over the latter between districts in order to increase the vulnerability of districts with higher percentage of elderly this explains also why districts with id 6 am alten nördlichen friedhof id 5 am alten nördlichen friedhof and id 2 augustenstraβe show the shortest recovery times of 15 3 h 16 3 h and 15 8 h i e are more resilient these are among the districts with the lowest percentage of e this shows a similar trend to the total fri duration but it provides additional quantifiable spatial information on a district basis table 3 household income i has a strong correlation with the recovery strength the higher it is the easier and faster it is to recover from flooding by repairing or replacing the damaged goods therefore this indicator was assigned the higher weight w f i 3 the developed fri is thus highly sensitive to changes in the annual household income chen and leandro 2019 it is important to include it in the recovery i is useful for comparing and keeping in perspective the relative impact of the adaption measures since this indicator is not affected by the measures themselves due to data scarcity however i was assumed constant in maxvorstadt and the scalability of this indicator could not be further investigated unlike methods quantifying resilience based on system performance mugume et al 2014 dong et al 2017 resilience applying the scalable fri does not necessarily recover to 1 0 once the event phase is over the scalable fri is also time variable and it is possible to zoom in from a global maxvorstadt to a building level to verify those values closely in addition it is possible to summarize various resilience e g fri average duration or minimum and flood physical indoor water depths and duration characteristics table 3 these values can be helpful for decision makers they can aid prioritize measures for climate change adaption at city district or building level based on different objectives in addition threshold values can be set for initiating action or adopting measures oladokun and montz 2018 looking at the average fri duration hr we can conclude that district id 1 königsplatz had the highest value before adaptation after adaptation its value drops to a value much closer to the other districts id 4 marsfeld benefits the most of all districts with a reduction of about 70 if we focus on the minimum average fri another interesting inference can be made district id 8 schönfeldvorstadt keeps ranking as the worst value before and after the adaptation is applied nonetheless the new value after adaptation is able to reach at least the values of the other districts before adaptation 5 4 limitations of the flood resilience index the fri is able to estimate resilience for the event and recovery phase with focus on the household indeed by using the household as unit of measure of the fri we do not include other equality important aspects of resilience such as the resilience of the urban infrastructure critical services or communication systems had we include such indicators then the recovery times would have been much larger and not of the order of 4 days also we have adopted a definition with limited scope for the resilience to climate change we explicitly left out the ability of the system to adapt i e to adjust to climate change and take advantage of opportunities as advocated by the ipcc fifth assessment report as such resilience of a household is only able to recover to its initial state and not build back better bbb as introduced by the un in 2006 and part of the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction 2015 2030 it should be noted that the latter was intentionally left out since to date there is no agreement on how to assess bbb strategies based on suitable indicators fernandez and ahmed 2019 the fri developed herein does however fill an important gap in the many existing methods of quantifying resilience holistic frameworks such as the city resilience index with 52 indicators arup international development 2012 tend to focus primarily on systems institutions and policies and not on the people and resources available bahadur and pichon 2016 the developed fri can be used to complement or replace specific indicators which cover the households in such holistic frameworks the advantage here is that the time component and scalability would be inherently taken care by our approach 6 conclusions in this paper a scalable flood resilience index for measuring climate change adaptation was presented the climate change impact in munich was investigated using scenarios generated by the crcm5 large ensemble it was confirmed that the increase of the rainfall intensity across all range of durations and return periods driven by climate change is expected for munich this supports the argument that munich is not invulnerable to the impacts of climate change particularly regarding heavy rainfall the advantages of scalability and time variance has proven to be most valuable for the study of climate change adaptation the proposed index enables a chirurgical analyses event based of a city s resilience it is possible to analyse the same results at different levels household district or borough scale in particular the fri was able to identify households and districts mostly affected marsfeld and schönfeldvorstadt the ones that best benefit from the climate household adaptation königsplatz and marsfeld and the ones which were already resilient am alten nördlichen friedhof and augustenstraβe the effect of climate change adaptation can be further aggregated using different criteria it is suggested to aggregate base on the correlation between different buildings resilience curves or on resilience curves with reduced fri both allow different assessment means of prioritizing future investments this study also showed that household adaptation measures can be effective in mitigating the impacts of climate change in maxvorsatdt a combination of flood proof gate with an indoor tank and a submersible pump system was implemented in all houses even without optimisation of the measure it was able to improve 57 of affected buildings with a fri equal to 1 0 during event and recovery phase for the worst scenario the remaining buildings improved considerably their recovery times it is thus expectable that following an optimisation strategy with variable combination size of the household adaptation strategies further improvements can be achieved some limitations of the proposed fri were also discussed the fri measures the resilience of the household alone without further consideration of other aspects of resilience such as urban infrastructure or critical services the inclusion of indicators covering those aspects would be more holistic and increase the recovery times also the definition of resilience adopted herein limited the ability to recover beyond the original state it is argued that to date there is no agreement on how this could be properly represented by indicators it was also noted that the developed fri fills an important gap in the existing methods for quantifying resilience holistic frameworks tend to focus primarily on systems institutions and policies and not on the people and resources available hence besides being used as stand alone this fri can be used either to complement or replace indicators in existing frameworks the latter would allow current frameworks to benefit from this fri main advantages namely its time component and scalability also it would enable to extend the outreach of this study the proposed fri could further its impact on the regulation for control development in flood hazard areas insurance premiums to property owners and likely lead to a reduction of the expenditures for disaster assistance from governments finally and without retracting from the methodology and the conclusions presented herein we have focus only on the most extreme of the future scenarios 2070 2099 however similar conclusions could have

18087,climate change is affecting the frequency and intensity of rainfall extreme events worldwide despite the growing global awareness developing flood resilient cities has proven to be a major challenge this paper investigates the application of an event based scalable flood resilience index fri for assessing climate change adaptation flood resilience is represented by three dimensions physical social and economic a household climate adaptation is adopted consisting of a combination of a flood proof gate with an indoor tank and a submersible pump system implemented in all houses the climate related impact under a high emission scenario rcp8 5 is analysed for munich with the crcm5 large ensemble results show that for munich extreme heavy rainfall events are increasing the fri can successfully identify households and districts which a are mostly affected by heavy rainfall b benefit the most from the climate adaptation and c are the most resilient for the most severe future scenario investigated the climate adaptation measure was able to improve 57 of all affected buildings within maxvorstadt to an fri equal to 1 0 during the event and recovery phase keywords climate change climate adaptation measures flood resilience analysis heavy rainfall urban areas 1 introduction according to the oecd s environmental outlook to 2050 the number of severe weather events has increased worldwide organisation for economic co operation and development 2012 a large number of studies show that climate change is leading to an increase in both the frequency and intensity of hydrometeorological extremes ipcc 2014 aalbers et al 2018 martel et al 2019 innocenti et al 2019 sillmann et al 2013 fischer and knutti 2016 recent data from the centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters shows that floods alone accounted for over 47 of weather related disasters in the period between 1995 and 2015 centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters cred and united nations office for disaster risk reduction unisdr 2015 population growth and uncontrolled building on flood plains are two factors attributed to the increasing vulnerability to extreme weather events despite the growing global awareness as depicted by several reports by the world bank ipcc european commission and un moving towards more flood resilient cities leandro 2015 has proven a major challenge in both developing and developed countries vis et al 2003 this transition to a resilience approach focused on flexible adaptable solutions clearly requires a departure from the traditional resistance based approach focused on flood safe solutions in flood risk management tempels and hartmann 2014 in this paper we present a method for measuring climate change adaptation of cities based on a quantifiable and scalable flood resilience index fri there are more than 70 definitions of flood resilience fisher 2015 these vary between two extremes resilience as the ability of a system to bounce back after stress or as the ability of groups or communities to cope with external stresses adger 2000 conceptually it is viewed as a quality measure which is degraded over time it has a first phase in which the community experiences a more or less sudden loss of resilience during the event phase and a recovery phase in which the community is expected to bounce back or re establish its normal performance bruneau et al 2003 however in water domain less than one quarter of all publications 21 on resilience actually focus on cities from which the vast majority is linked to system reliability rodina 2019 or system performance roach et al 2018 ahn and choi 2013 gersonius et al 2012 wang et al 2019 dong et al 2017 because of difficulties in operationalizing concepts few studies mathematically define resilience of a community in terms of its ability to absorb recover from and adapt to adverse flooding as defined by the us national academies national research council 2012 oladokun and montz 2018 overcome this difficulty by defining three factors namely hazard absorption capacity resource availability and resource utilization processes which are then compared against respective threshold values most studies on quantifying resilience develop indicators indices for measuring the characteristics of a city or a community to address different resilience dimensions this approach is able to reveal the relative position magnitude and direction of change of a community s resilience in face of a disaster the city resilience index applies 4 dimensions 12 goals and 52 indicators arup international development 2012 the four dimensions are health and well being economy and society infrastructure and environment and leadership and strategy the 52 indicators identify the critical factors at city scale that contribute towards the 12 goals set for each city miguez and vero 2016 proposed the flood resilience index fresi it contains 7 indicators including flood properties and social factors such as number of people income and inadequate sanitation the fresi is built to support decision making by comparing the value difference between present and future scenarios batica and gourbesville 2016 developed a city fri applying five dimensions social economic institutional physical and natural the evaluation is done with a set of 91 indicators which describe the physical and social attributes of an urban system the resulting fri can be visualized along those five dimensions all previous studies have in common that the resulting fri is not time dependent and it is assessed at city scale in fact most indicators and assessment frameworks are not fully satisfactory at household level jones et al 2018 these frameworks tend to focus primarily on systems institutions and policies that deliver resilience and not on the people and the resources available to them bahadur and pichon 2016 furthermore most analysis are done based on time horizons past present future sharifi 2016 but rarely as event based chen and leandro 2019 time dependent studies focus on a specific system s performance to quantify resilience either the surface or the drainage system mugume et al 2014 dong et al 2017 or on damage functions lee and kim 2017 in those cases recovery phase is complete and resilience returns to its original status once flooding recedes this paper investigates a method for assessing climate change adaptation based on an event based scalable flood resilience index fri the fri considers three dimensions of resilience physical social and economic unlike previous studies the developed fri is quantifiable at household level and it is time dependent making suitable its aggregation to higher scales scalable household resilience to climate change is defined as the capacity of a household to withstand adverse effects following extreme flooding events and the ability to recover to the household original conditions as such we limit the definition of resilience to two phases event and recovery 2 study area and data maxvorstadt is one of the 25 boroughs in the city of munich germany it consists of the 9 districts königsplatz augustenstraβe st benno marsfeld josephsplatz am alten nördlichen friedhof universität schönfeldvorstadt and massmannbergl fig 1 69 of the borough area is occupied by buildings the vast majority of the surface area is sealed with only 7 occupied by green areas highest elevations are found in the west part of maxvorstadt 580 m and lowest in the east 510 m this is a relatively flat area of munich and therefore it is at risk of flooding for extreme rainfall events the present average annual precipitation is about 944 mm which is higher than the national average of 700 mm maxvorstadt is a typical academic area with population typically ranging between 20 and 30 years old for that reason the children and elderly population is relatively low when compared with other boroughs table 1 presents the number of buildings and social indicators for each district in maxvorstadt due to data scarcity annual household income was assumed constant and equal to 57 000 for all districts in maxvorstadt the latter value corresponds to an estimated average income in munich 1 1 sources payscale estimates the average salary in munich to be 56k salary explorer and merkur tz redaktions gmbh co kg cites gehalt de estimate it to be 59k 3 methods 3 1 climate change and household adaptation 3 1 1 climate change and baseline scenarios in this study future rainfall is predicted based on the crcm5 large ensemble crcm5 le with a spatial resolution of 0 11 approx 12 km and a temporal resolution of 1 hr under the most extreme representative concentration pathway rcp8 5 leduc et al 2019 rainfall scenarios are split into four time periods of 30 years interval 1980 2009 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 the former is termed baseline scenario and the latter three are the future climate change scenarios based on the crcm5 le the base scenario is taken from kostra rainfall data as produced by the german weather service dwd der deutsche wetterdiesnt 2017 this is a raster data base of rainfall intensity duration curves for the whole germany in 8 5 8 5 km2 the crcm5 le consists of 50 equally likely climate realizations of present and future climate based on the large number of model years 1500 years per 30 year period the future change of rainfall intensities with long return periods 100 years can be estimated future rainfall intensities with durations greater than 1 hr and return periods ranging from one to 100 years were estimated by determining the empirical quantiles since un corrected precipitation data from the crcm5 le which is normal for regional climate models is used the data shows some biases in order to overcome the large effort of bias adjusting the original hourly data the delta change approach hay et al 2000 is applied to the kostra rainfall data the delta change approach allows several rainfall intensities to be derived for different rainfall durations and return periods this approach is based on a factor which is the percentage changed between the future values c r c m 5 s c t and the baseline c r c m 5 b a s e l i n e t by multiplying this factor f s c t with the idf curves intensity duration frequency derived from observed data from kostra i k o s t r a t the climate change scenarios i s c t for different return periods t are obtained 1 i s c t i k o s t r a t f s c t in which f s c t is given by 2 f s c t 1 c r c m 5 s c t c r c m 5 b a s e l i n e t c r c m 5 b a s e l i n e t additionally sub hourly intensities of the idf curve derived from the crcm5 le are linearly extrapolated down to 15 min duration 3 1 2 household adaptation household flood volume is based on a one way coupling it is assumed that the flooded volume inside the building is much smaller than the flood volume outside therefore only the indoor water depths are affected by the household adaptations in this case flooding of the household is allowed once the water levels outside the building exceeds the door ground elevation resilience of the household can be improved via redundancy or flexibility measures mugume et al 2015 the former includes the addition of storage facilities and the latter the design of flood proofing options herein a mixed solution is use for enhancing the climate adaptive capacity of the household a flood proof gate is installed at the door to prevent the floodwater from entering the building and a flood tank is built inside the building to temporarily store possible water overtopping the flood gate in this case a submersible pump is activated with constant flow rate r pump which is turned off once the flood tank volume returns to zero the volume t and water depths inside of the household h in t are given by 3 t t 1 f l u x t s c e l l t 1 4 h in t t area area m2 is the building area s m 2 i s the total storage volume of the tank f l u x t is the water volume entering exiting the building given by 5 flux t s i g n h o u t h i n 2 3 c d l 2 g h o u t h i n 3 2 r p u m p 1000 δ t δ t s is the computation time interval c d 0 6 is the discharge coefficient l 0 75 m is the door width h out is the water depth outside of the household r pump is the pumping rate l s cell t m s is the water volume inside the underground flood tank given by 6 cell t m i n s cell t 1 flux t flux t 0 m a x 0 cell t 1 flux t flux t 0 t 1 0 with this adaptive strategy flooding in the household only occurs once the storage capacity of the flood tank is exceeded cell t s cellar tanks may vary between 0 5 and 3 5 m3 flood proof gates may vary between 10 and 30 cm in this case study a flood proof gate of 10 cm with flood tank of 3 m3 and a pump rate of 5 l s is selected a submersible pump is used to make the solution more resilient also to higher water depth events 3 2 scalable fri flood resilience index the scalable fri is time variable and quantified at the household level as such it is easier to aggregate it to higher scales without loss of information three scales are proposed in this study borough the large scale corresponding to the whole area of maxvorstadt in munich f r i district the intermediate scale which aggregates the fri into 9 grouped elements f r i d each containing h n households see table 1 and the household level which includes 5573 individual elements f r i h for each scale the average fri f r i the 95 confidence interval ci 95 the minimum fri m i n f r i and the fri duration can be calculated see fig 2 7 f r i t 1 9 d 1 9 f r i d t f r i d t 1 h n h 1 h n f r i h t the fri at the household level f r i h is time variable and includes indicators reflecting three resilience dimensions namely physical social and economic it is calculated as a compound equation which distinguishes between event t t s t e and recovery phase t t e 8 f r i h t w f y i y t w f y t t s t e f r i h t 1 r f t t e rf is the recovery factor given by 9 r f i x w f x 0 001 w f x w f y and i y are the event phase weighting factors and indicators of y namely total flooding depth h accumulated water depth a w d flood duration d and the water accumulation rate w a r during the event phase only physically based indicators derived from the flood modelling are considered w f x and i x are the recovery phase weighting factors and indicators of x namely flood severity f s total flooding depth t f d total flooding time t f t maximum water accumulation rate w a r m a x household with children c elderly population e household income i the first four take into account the physical characteristics of the flood event the latter three enable the consideration of social and economic characteristics of each household structure affecting the recovery phase which is only initiated once the flooding has receded h 0 the contribution of the social and economic factors to the recovery phase is limited by thresholds c ref e ref and i r e f for example we assume that having an income larger than i r e f 80 000 cannot further positively impact your recovery time w f determines the relative weight of each indicator the event phase factors w f h w f a w d w f d and w f w a r are assigned 3 1 3 and 2 the recovery factors w f f s w f t f d w f t f t w f w a r m a x w f c w f e and w f i are assigned 3 1 2 1 1 2 and 3 respectively the former factors allow us to give different weights to the 4 physical indicators in the event phase while the latter allow us to weight the social and economic indicators differently in the recovery phase all indicators vary both in time t and in space spatial variability in the physical indicators is a function of the simulated water depths and in the socio and economic indicators is a function of the district see table 1 as any index the developed fri cannot include all aspects that play a role in the three dimensions considered the fri aims to make and inference considering indirect relations established by its indicators miguez and vero 2016 for example by reducing the indoor water depths the adaption measures studied herein act directly in all physically based indicators event and recovery phases the lower the indoor water depth the less severe is the flooding in each time the more resilient the system becomes h increases and f s recovers faster the accumulated water depth provides an indicator of the full scope of the impact that a household can withstand which is related with the maximum accumulated h in a w d increases and t f d recovers faster the lower the duration of the flood the less damages it will cause d increases t f t recovers faster these include physical damages but also health impacts due to the reduced exposure to water borne and vector borne diseases the water rising rate will be also reduced hence this will impact positively to the resilience particularly during evacuation of people or rescue of goods those actions will be allowed more time to be completed w a r increases and w a r m a x recovers faster parameters in the social and economic indicators are assigned according with the different districts of maxvorstadt and are therefore not affected by the adaptation measures a summary of all indicators are presented in table 2 further details including a sensitivity analysis on the parameters can be found in chen and leandro 2019 3 3 p dwave parallel diffusive wave model the flood inundation model parallel diffusive wave p dwave is the surface overland flow model applied in this study it is a first order finite volume explicit discretization scheme that neglects the inertial terms in 2d shallow water equations the governing equations are described by 10 dh dt uh r 11 g h

results in benchmark tests can be found in leandro et al 2014 p dwave has been also applied validated against other shallow water equation models in urban areas in the uk martins et al 2017 and in germany leandro et al 2016 pflugbeil et al 2019 4 results 4 1 climate change scenarios the temporal dowscalling of rainfall intensity down to 15 min durations are plotted in fig 3 by using the delta change approach several rainfall intensities are derived for different rainfall durations and return periods ranging from 1 to 100 years it can be seen that the rainfall intensity increases with the return period and with the increase of the future periods within rcp8 5 for the sake of simplicity we will focus the next sections of this study on the results using rainfall corresponding to a 100 year return period and 15 min duration the rainfall intensity values are in this case equal to 132 4 132 5 168 7 and 175 6 mm h for the four time periods 1980 2009 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 respectively 4 2 flood inundation modelling with and without household adaptation measures the flood inundation results are plotted in fig 4 a the downscaled 15 min rainfall intensity with 100 year return period is applied to the p dwave model to simulate the flood inundation for each of the four time periods it can be seen that the flood inundation increases with the timeline the average water depth on the streets for each of the time periods is equal to 11 10 11 12 14 00 and 14 53 cm because we assumed a one way coupling the household adaptation measures do not impact the water depths on the streets in theory a two way coupling would be more precise in this case the flood volume on the streets should be slightly less depending on the volume of water entering the buildings since the maximum relative difference between the volumes of water of all tanks and the volume of water at the surface is smaller than 4 5 we deemed this assumption as acceptable the maximum indoor water depths of each building with and without adaptation measures are plotted in fig 4b and c respectively in this study the same household adaptation measure was adopted for all buildings namely a flood proof gate of 10 cm with flood tank of 3 m3 and a submersible pump rate of 5 l s the indoor water depths of the buildings are aggregated and displayed in steps of 10 cm as such it is easier to evaluate the impact of the adaption measure for example the impact in the first time period is clearly seen by the increase in the number of buildings with indoor water depths in the range of 0 10 cm cyan which jumps from 2 to 68 with a corresponding decrease in the percentage of the higher water depths ranges for water depths higher than 20 cm the adaption measure is no longer efficient the efficiency of the adaptation measures would in any case improve for smaller return periods for which the tank and pump are still able to cope with the indoor flooded water 4 3 scalable flood resilience index this section demonstrates the main attractive features of the resilience curves calculated based on the flood resilience index fri namely its scalability and time variance fig 5 shows three levels of aggregation of the resilience curves for each time period including a single building fig 5a the district of königsplatz fig 5b and the whole maxvorstadt fig 5c it is clear the impact of the household adaptation measures at each level in increasing the fri closer to 1 0 or reducing the recovery time by inspection of the dashed with adaptation and solid without adaptation lines since scenario four is the most extreme 2070 2099 we will focus on this last time period hereafter the resilience curves at district level are further illustrated in fig 6 herein the resilience curves are further aggregated inside each district depending on their behaviour similar behaviours can be identified via a correlation analysis buildings with similar resilience curves i e a correlation coefficient higher than 0 5 are aggregated to generate the 95 confidence interval ci 95 depending on the correlation coefficients of each building s resilience curves it was possible to identify and aggregate the curves in either three similar groups district id 1 and 4 two groups id 2 8 and 9 or one single group id 3 5 6 and 7 inside each district focusing on the effect of the adaptation measures it is possible to display the district maps highlighting the households which now retain the fri equal to 1 0 and the ones that do not fig 7 the latter do experience an improvement through the application of the adaptation measures however there is still some loss of resilience being observed the results of the effect of applying adaptation measures are summarized in table 3 for each district and whole maxvorstadt the effect in terms of total fri duration average fri duration and minimum average fri are presented these are the results of the aggregated resilience curves in addition the maximum average indoor water depth h in and its average duration are also displayed in bold are the benefits of the adaption measure highlighted for the most hit district for example district id 4 has the highest total fri duration of 109 3 h after adaptation this value drops to 46 4 h even though it still remains the highest value of all districts it experiences an improvement close to 60 it is also interesting to notice that the highest impact value found before and after the adaption does not always correspond to the same district for easiness light and dark grey highlight the lowest and highest impact value obtained by a district respectively this clearly reflects the dynamic nature of the flood simulations which is captured by the flood resilience index 5 discussion 5 1 climate change scenarios the results obtained by the crcm5 le for munich clearly show an increase of the rainfall intensity across all range of durations and return periods driven by climate change this is inline with the majority of studies of future scenarios including climate change dong et al 2017 the highest rate of change is obtained in the transition from the second 2010 2039 to the third period 2040 2069 the highest absolute values are found in the last period 2070 2099 a similar behaviour is therefore also observed in 15 min downscaled rainfall intensity values obtained by the delta change approach this supports the argument that germany and in particular munich is also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change bender et al 2017 particularly in what concerns flooding from short duration high intensity rainfall heavy rainfall as highlighted in this study in any case it needs to be recognized that this is not a comprehensive climate change study for example an ensemble of climate model projections was not considered this study highlights in any case a likely extreme scenario for the city of munich 5 2 flood inundation modelling with and without flood measures maxvorstadt ground elevations vary between 580 and 510 m highest elevations are found in the west area generating a main flow direction towards east however and since maxvorstadt is a relatively flat area several areas experience ponding of water varying from few centimetres up to half a meter therefore the impact of the climate adaption measure is bound by the height of the ponding and the duration of the flooding next to areas surrounding each building the flood proof gate is able to retain the household dry up to 10 cm of water depth once this value is reached the flood proof gate starts to overflow at this point the flood tank begins to fill up while the flooded water is pumped out of the building depending on the duration of the overflow the tank pump system might keep the household dry diminish the duration and height of the indoor water depth or have negligible impact on the household flooding therefore the impact in areas which experienced heights above 20 cm red colour in fig 4 is limited whereas for heights below that the impact can be high to medium after in field observations it has been observed that electrical cables are laid underground and are therefore not susceptible to flooding within the study area there is a water proof medium voltage power station connected to numerous intermediate nodes buses the bus transformers from medium to low voltage supplying the households are nominally raised 30 cm above the ground surface on a cement platform if water raises above that height the power supply for the group of households supplied by it may fail since we did not focus our study on energy supply it was assumed that no power cuts could occur during flooding nevertheless the adaptation measure suggested herein could be easily equipped with a back up battery power option to keep operating in the event of power outage in our study we assumed that the adaptation measures were installed in all buildings nevertheless it would be possible to assign spatially variable adaption measures this would be necessary in case studies with limited budget e g poorer households for the application of such measures or in case an optimisation strategy would be sought households which experience flooding without adaptation strategies would see their fri unchanged since we adopted a one way coupling between flood simulation and indoor water depth see section 3 1 however we did not follow optimisation strategies in our study because of the high average income of the households in munich and in order to keep our focus on the scalability of the fri in measuring climate change impact here it should be noted that for the simulation of the flood propagation we did not consider the sewer system the sewer system would have drained part of the ponding water and reduced the maximum water depths since the water would remain in the surface indefinitely the resilience recovery phase could not be initiated in order to allow the recovery phase to take place flood inundation water is removed after 1 hr of simulation time in terms of maximum inundation extent produced by the 100 years return period the impact of neglecting the sewer system is in any case likely small according with the german standard en752 the design rainfall for sewer systems considers a rainfall with duration of 15min and return period between 5 and 20 years 5 3 scalable flood resilience index the flood resilience index is scalable it can be visualized at household level fig 5a district fig 5b and maxvorstadt fig 5c at household level it is represented by a single line whereas at the other two levels it is better visualized by its average fri f r i and 95 confidence interval ci 95 adaptation measures can be fit for each household or derived at different aggregation levels it is therefore more flexible than alternative fri miguez and vero 2016 batica and gourbesville 2016 which do not allow the household levels to be individualized fig 5a clearly shows the impact of the climate adaption measure in a single building in maxvorstadt recovery time is more than halved across all time periods studied the ci 95 of the resilience curve for the district of königsplatz displays a large band which emphasises the different behaviour of the individual buildings in that district the ability to aggregate the results according to different criteria is one of the advantages of our approach the ci 95 of the aggregated resilience curves based on district level and correlation between single resilience curves highlights that there are buildings with similar behaviour inside each district visually it can be represented in coloured maps which facilitate decision makes in making a city more resilient to climate change for example in district id 1 königsplatz fig 6 the blue buildings show a higher impact in the event phase than in the recovery phase on the contrary the yellow buildings show both a higher impact in the event and the recovery phase cleary the buildings in yellow should be given higher priority district id 8 schönfeldvorstadt show some buildings with very small minimum fri but also some buildings achieving a fri 1 0 after the implementation of the adaptation measures in fact 57 of all affected buildings inside maxvorstadt were able to improve their fr to 1 0 after applying the adaptation measure it is therefore also possible to aggregate based on resilience curves with reduced fri fig 6 buildings in id 4 marsfeld show the longest recovery phase of all districts with 46 4 h table 3 this district has the highest percentage of elderly in maxvorstadt which emphasises the contribution from the elderly population indicator e in addition this indicator was given a medium weight w f e of 2 the double of the weight w f c for the indicator of the household with children c as such we emphasise the disparity of the former over the latter between districts in order to increase the vulnerability of districts with higher percentage of elderly this explains also why districts with id 6 am alten nördlichen friedhof id 5 am alten nördlichen friedhof and id 2 augustenstraβe show the shortest recovery times of 15 3 h 16 3 h and 15 8 h i e are more resilient these are among the districts with the lowest percentage of e this shows a similar trend to the total fri duration but it provides additional quantifiable spatial information on a district basis table 3 household income i has a strong correlation with the recovery strength the higher it is the easier and faster it is to recover from flooding by repairing or replacing the damaged goods therefore this indicator was assigned the higher weight w f i 3 the developed fri is thus highly sensitive to changes in the annual household income chen and leandro 2019 it is important to include it in the recovery i is useful for comparing and keeping in perspective the relative impact of the adaption measures since this indicator is not affected by the measures themselves due to data scarcity however i was assumed constant in maxvorstadt and the scalability of this indicator could not be further investigated unlike methods quantifying resilience based on system performance mugume et al 2014 dong et al 2017 resilience applying the scalable fri does not necessarily recover to 1 0 once the event phase is over the scalable fri is also time variable and it is possible to zoom in from a global maxvorstadt to a building level to verify those values closely in addition it is possible to summarize various resilience e g fri average duration or minimum and flood physical indoor water depths and duration characteristics table 3 these values can be helpful for decision makers they can aid prioritize measures for climate change adaption at city district or building level based on different objectives in addition threshold values can be set for initiating action or adopting measures oladokun and montz 2018 looking at the average fri duration hr we can conclude that district id 1 königsplatz had the highest value before adaptation after adaptation its value drops to a value much closer to the other districts id 4 marsfeld benefits the most of all districts with a reduction of about 70 if we focus on the minimum average fri another interesting inference can be made district id 8 schönfeldvorstadt keeps ranking as the worst value before and after the adaptation is applied nonetheless the new value after adaptation is able to reach at least the values of the other districts before adaptation 5 4 limitations of the flood resilience index the fri is able to estimate resilience for the event and recovery phase with focus on the household indeed by using the household as unit of measure of the fri we do not include other equality important aspects of resilience such as the resilience of the urban infrastructure critical services or communication systems had we include such indicators then the recovery times would have been much larger and not of the order of 4 days also we have adopted a definition with limited scope for the resilience to climate change we explicitly left out the ability of the system to adapt i e to adjust to climate change and take advantage of opportunities as advocated by the ipcc fifth assessment report as such resilience of a household is only able to recover to its initial state and not build back better bbb as introduced by the un in 2006 and part of the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction 2015 2030 it should be noted that the latter was intentionally left out since to date there is no agreement on how to assess bbb strategies based on suitable indicators fernandez and ahmed 2019 the fri developed herein does however fill an important gap in the many existing methods of quantifying resilience holistic frameworks such as the city resilience index with 52 indicators arup international development 2012 tend to focus primarily on systems institutions and policies and not on the people and resources available bahadur and pichon 2016 the developed fri can be used to complement or replace specific indicators which cover the households in such holistic frameworks the advantage here is that the time component and scalability would be inherently taken care by our approach 6 conclusions in this paper a scalable flood resilience index for measuring climate change adaptation was presented the climate change impact in munich was investigated using scenarios generated by the crcm5 large ensemble it was confirmed that the increase of the rainfall intensity across all range of durations and return periods driven by climate change is expected for munich this supports the argument that munich is not invulnerable to the impacts of climate change particularly regarding heavy rainfall the advantages of scalability and time variance has proven to be most valuable for the study of climate change adaptation the proposed index enables a chirurgical analyses event based of a city s resilience it is possible to analyse the same results at different levels household district or borough scale in particular the fri was able to identify households and districts mostly affected marsfeld and schönfeldvorstadt the ones that best benefit from the climate household adaptation königsplatz and marsfeld and the ones which were already resilient am alten nördlichen friedhof and augustenstraβe the effect of climate change adaptation can be further aggregated using different criteria it is suggested to aggregate base on the correlation between different buildings resilience curves or on resilience curves with reduced fri both allow different assessment means of prioritizing future investments this study also showed that household adaptation measures can be effective in mitigating the impacts of climate change in maxvorsatdt a combination of flood proof gate with an indoor tank and a submersible pump system was implemented in all houses even without optimisation of the measure it was able to improve 57 of affected buildings with a fri equal to 1 0 during event and recovery phase for the worst scenario the remaining buildings improved considerably their recovery times it is thus expectable that following an optimisation strategy with variable combination size of the household adaptation strategies further improvements can be achieved some limitations of the proposed fri were also discussed the fri measures the resilience of the household alone without further consideration of other aspects of resilience such as urban infrastructure or critical services the inclusion of indicators covering those aspects would be more holistic and increase the recovery times also the definition of resilience adopted herein limited the ability to recover beyond the original state it is argued that to date there is no agreement on how this could be properly represented by indicators it was also noted that the developed fri fills an important gap in the existing methods for quantifying resilience holistic frameworks tend to focus primarily on systems institutions and policies and not on the people and resources available hence besides being used as stand alone this fri can be used either to complement or replace indicators in existing frameworks the latter would allow current frameworks to benefit from this fri main advantages namely its time component and scalability also it would enable to extend the outreach of this study the proposed fri could further its

18088,degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons hc in sediments is often limited by the availability of electron acceptors by allowing long distance electron transport ldet between anoxic sediments and oxic overlying water bioelectrochemical snorkels may stimulate the regeneration of sulphate in the anoxic sediment thereby accelerating petroleum hc degradation cable bacteria can also mediate ldet between anoxic and oxic sediment layers and thus theoretically stimulate petroleum hc degradation here we quantitatively assessed the impact of cable bacteria and snorkels on the degradation of alkanes in marine sediment from aarhus bay denmark after seven weeks cable bacteria and snorkels accelerated alkanes degradation by 24 and 25 respectively compared to control sediment with no cable bacteria nor snorkel the combination of snorkels and cable bacteria further enhanced alkanes degradation 46 higher degradation rates were sustained by ldet induced sulphide removal rather than as initially hypothesized sulphate regeneration cable bacteria are thus overlooked players in the self healing capacity of crude oil contaminated sediments and may inspire novel remediation treatments upon hydrocarbon spillage graphical abstract image 1 keywords cable bacteria snorkel sediment hydrocarbon long distance electron transport remediation 1 introduction microbial oil degradation in sediments is often limited by the availability of electron acceptors e g meckenstock et al 2015 in impermeable coastal and shelf sediment the mass transport of solutes from the water is governed by slow molecular diffusion which restricts the availability of electron acceptors such as oxygen o2 and nitrate no3 to the topmost millimeters fenchel and jørgensen 1977 glud 2008 sulphate so4 2 may penetrate centimetres to meters into marine sediments and thus despite being a less favourable electron acceptor may account for a large fraction of organic matter degradation jørgensen 2006 in addition to diffusion from the water so4 2 can be regenerated within the anoxic sediment via the re oxidation of sulphide h2s and other reduced sulphur species with insoluble iron fe and manganese mn oxides serving as electron acceptor as these minerals are ultimately formed under oxic conditions in the absence of sediment mixing by bioturbating organisms h2s re oxidation is constrained to the proximity of oxic anoxic interfaces in petroleum hc contaminated sediment the high demand of so4 2 by oil degrading microorganisms may exceed the rate of so4 2 supply from the water and via h2s oxidation potentially leading to local so4 2 limitation supply limitations and the less favourable thermodynamic of so4 2 may account for a long persistence of petroleum hc in the anoxic compartment of marine sediments e g reddy et al 2002 peterson et al 2003 culbertson et al 2008 a bioelectrochemical snorkel is an electrically conductive non polarized material e g graphite platinum stain less steel applied to short circuit redox gradients erable et al 2011 hoareau et al 2019 snorkels offer a preferential route for electrons to move from highly reduced to oxidized zones where electrons can react with o2 to generate water this electron flow may occur over centimetres distances and thus may enable microorganisms the remote access to otherwise out of reach o2 eventually resulting in enhanced oxidation rates under anaerobic conditions the application of snorkels in petroleum hc contaminated marine sediment resulted in improved microbial hc degradation in combination with increased so4 2 availability indicating that the snorkel enhanced so4 2 regeneration via promoting h2s oxidation on the electrode cruz viggi et al 2015 the detection of ferric iron fe3 minerals on the surface of snorkels applied in riverine sediments viggi et al 2017 suggested that the re oxidation of h2s to so4 2 may also occur via reduction of fe oxides with the produced ferrous iron fe2 scavenged by the snorkel despite these studies show that snorkels can accelerate petroleum hc biodegradation in sediments the biogeochemical mechanism that controls the transfer of electrons from the hc to snorkels remains to a large extent uncertain and may vary from site to site owing to their ability to access remote electron acceptors and stimulate regeneration of so4 2 at depth risgaard petersen et al 2012 cable bacteria can be considered the biological analogue of a snorkel cable bacteria are filamentous desulfobulbaceae able to mediate electric currents thereby coupling anodic h2s oxidation at a few centimetres depth with cathodic o2 or no3 reduction close to the sediment water interface nielsen et al 2010 pfeffer et al 2012 marzocchi et al 2014 cable bacteria were reported from a wide range of sediments e g risgaard petersen et al 2015 burdorf et al 2017 marzocchi et al 2018 including oil contaminated sites müller et al 2016 matturro et al 2017 because of their ability to mediate long distance electron transport ldet they have been hypothesized to stimulate petroleum hc degradation by functioning as snorkels however a cause effect relationship between the activity of cable bacteria and petroleum hc degradation has not been so far demonstrated in the present study we quantitatively assessed the impact of such biological cable bacteria and engineered snorkel ldet systems deployed alone and in combination on the degradation of petroleum hc in marine sediments from aarhus bay denmark moreover we comparatively investigated their respective geochemical imprints with a focus on sulphur s and iron fe cycling and their impact on the benthic microbial community 2 methods 2 1 sediment sampling and pre treatment sediment was collected from aarhus bay denmark at station m5 56 06 20 n 10 27 48 e depth 30 m which is known to host cable bacteria marzocchi et al 2014 using a box corer on site the upper 10 12 cm of sediment were discarded to exclude large shells and stones that might interfere with the microprofiling measurements see section 2 2 the underlying sulfidic sediment was sealed in airtight bags brought to the laboratory and stored at 15 c within a few weeks the bags were opened and the sediment was sieved mesh size 0 5 mm homogenised and contaminated with crude oil statfjord oil sediment contamination to a final concentration of 1 v w was performed as in viggi et al 2015 the contaminated sediment was then packed into 12 glass liners 4 3 8 cm diam x height four treatments were prepared to discern the individual and combined impact of cable bacteria and snorkel on sediment geochemistry i e 1 negative control with no snorkel and no cable bacteria control snorkel with no cable bacteria snorkel cable bacteria with no snorkel cable bacteria and 4 snorkel

similarly to pfeffer et al 2012 compared to the original method we applied glass fiber instead of the polycarbonate filters to avoid adsorption of oil hc to the filter material and applied two filters at the depths of 5 and 10 mm instead of one to further insure the inhibition of cable bacteria snorkels were made of graphite 99 9995 purity alfa aesar milan italy rods 6 15 120 mm diam x height

aquarium containing artificial seawater salinity 30 red sea salts red sea fish pharm ltd eilat israel the water was kept gently stirred by an aquarium pump depth microprofiles of o2 h2s ph and redox potential were measured at the beginning and at the end of the incubation period in all cores in addition microprofiles were measured weekly except for week 6 in all treatments except for those with filters to avoid filter damage sediment was sampled at the beginning two days after contamination and at the end of the incubation for sampling sediment cores were removed from the aquaria and the sediment was extracted from the liners under n2 atmosphere and homogenised approx 1 g of sediment was snap frozen 80 c for later 16s rrna extraction samples for fluorescence in situ hybridization fish for cable bacteria detection were collected from the sediment and from the surface of snorkels as in matturro et al 2017 four to 7 g of sediment were collected and stored at 20 c for later analysis of the content of n alkanes in the c9 c31 interval hereon referred to as alkanes the rest of the sediment was centrifuged 8000 r p m x 15 min and the supernatant was sampled 1 5 ml for so4 2

geochemical imprint and σh2s dynamics throughout the incubation after two weeks of incubation σh2s and ph depth profiles in the cable bacteria cores showed the typical signature for cable bacteria activity i e build up of a 2 cm thick zone devoid of both o2 and σh2s intense proton consumption in the oxic portion of the sediment ph maxima compatible with cathodic o2 consumption and acidification in the suboxic zone compatible with anodic h2s oxidation fig 1 a e g nielsen et al 2010 meysman et al 2015 snorkel cable bacteria cores showed analogous patterns indicating the presence of cable bacteria although with two remarkable differences a 40 higher attenuation of the upward flux of σh2s 6 5 vs 3 8 μmol m 2 h 1 and a less pronounced ph maxima fig 1a this is descriptive of a contribution of the snorkel to ldet that is σh2s consumption over a deeper sediment horizon and cathodic o2 reduction mainly occurring in the overlying water which did not contribute to the ph increase in the subsurface sediment over the course of the incubation in the snorkel cable bacteria treatment the sulphidic front depth with σh2s 1 μm deepened monotonically throughout the seven week period moving from 1 0 cm below the sediment water interface at time zero to 2 5 cm depth at the end of the incubation fig 1b in the cable bacteria treatment the σh2s concentration showed a less linear trend fig 1c within the first two weeks the sulphidic front moved from 1 0 to 2 15 cm in the following two weeks the sulphidic front remained steady however σh2s accumulated in the deeper sediment layers 2 15 cm after four weeks the continued σh2s accumulation in the deeper sediment affected the sulphidic front which raised progressively and realigned with the depth recorded at the beginning of the experiment i e 0 95 cm 3 2 alkanes degradation at the end of the incubation at the end of the seven week incubation period the concentration of alkanes in controls 0 114 mg g 1 dry weight dw was not significantly lower compared to the beginning of the experiment t test p 0 2 n 6 fig 2 two way anova analysis indicated significant variations due to the factors snorkel and cable bacteria p 0 01 in the snorkel and in the cable bacteria treatments the concentration of alkanes dropped by 24 and 25 respectively compared to the control tukey test p 0 04 the concentration of alkanes in the snorkel cable bacteria treatment was significantly lower compared to controls i e 54 tukey test p 0 01 and to the snorkel and the cable bacteria treatments tukey test p 0 02 3 3 impact of cable bacteria and snorkel on sediment biogeochemistry at the end of the incubation at the end of the incubation period σh2s was detected in the control at 1 0 cm depth fig 3 a with the concentration increasing to 100 μm at 2 7 cm depth in the cable bacteria treatment σh2s was measured at 1 1 cm depth and reached concentrations 100 μm at 3 3 cm depth in the snorkel treatment σh2s was below detection limit up to a depth of 2 0 cm and at the bottom of the profile 4 0 cm depth σh2s only reached 37 μm 5 4 s e m the snorkel cable bacteria treatment was the most efficient in maintaining low σh2s levels as σh2s was not detected to 2 6 cm and it only reached 14 μm 6 6 at 4 0 cm depth in the control the ph decreased with depth from the overlying water value of 8 6 reaching a minimum of 7 77 0 04 at 1 05 cm the snorkel treatment had a similar pattern but maintained lower values starting from a 0 6 cm depth minimum of 7 61 0 02 at 1 75 cm as opposed to these treatments those including cable bacteria showed subsurface peaks with maximum value of 8 5 at 0 2 0 3 cm depth and reached lower minimum values i e 7 3 7 4 fig 3b in the snorkel cable bacteria the ph minimum was detected at higher depth 2 4 cm compared to the cable bacteria treatment 1 05 cm redox profiles mirrored those of the σh2s with increasingly positive values following the order control cable bacteria snorkel snorkel cable bacteria indicative of a progressively less reduced environment when applying ldet systems alone or in combination fig 3c compared to the control all the three treatments resulted in a tangible increase in redox potential between 80 and 150 mv in the 0 5 1 5 cm depth interval deeper in the sediment the impact of cable bacteria alone on redox potential attenuated and values tended to realign to the control whereas in both snorkel treatments values remained higher compared to control 50 to 60 mv at 4 cm the presence of the snorkel resulted in higher concentration of so4 2 compared to the treatments without it two way anova p 0 01 fig 3d in the snorkel treatment so4 2 increased only slightly compared to the control however the difference was not significant tukey test p 0 39 the snorkel cable bacteria treatment showed the highest concentration of so4 2 and the difference with the controls resulted significant tukey test p 0 05 such an increase in so4 2 was coupled to a net decrease in avs snorkel cable bacteria vs control tukey test p 0 05 and release of fe2 snorkel cable bacteria vs control tukey test p 0 05 confirming an ongoing fes dissolution and h2s re oxidation to so4 2 sulphate avs and fe2 concentrations in the snorkel treatment with no cable bacteria showed trends analogous to the above described ones although of an attenuated intensity compared to the snorkel cable bacteria treatment only fe2 concentration was significantly higher in the snorkel treatment compared to the control tukey test p 0 05 the so4 2 concentration was lower in the cable bacteria treatment compared to all other treatments tukey test p 0 05 confirming that their activity was decreasing after seven weeks of incubation fig 1c no net increase in fe2 was recorded in the cable bacteria treatment compared to the control however cable bacteria were the only significant factor determining the decrease in avs two way anova p 0 01 the presence of cable bacteria significantly decreased the avs concentration two way anova p 0 01 regardless of the presence of the snorkel the avs concentrations decreased in the order control snorkel cable bacteria snorkel cable bacteria this trend mirrored that for ph minima i e lowest avs concentration observed with lowest ph fig 3b suggesting that fes dissolution was likely driven by acidic forming anodic oxidations mediated by cable bacteria 3 4 impact of cable bacteria and snorkel on bacterial communities at the end of the incubation cable bacteria were detected in the cable bacteria and snorkel cable bacteria treatments at relative abundances of 0 1 but were undetected in the cores with filters i e control and snorkel treatment fish imaging in both cable bacteria treatments confirmed their typical filamentous form that allows them to stretch across the sediment redox zonation to perform ldet fig s2 bacterial phyla composition in sediment cores did not substantially differed as a result of different treatments chloroflexi deltaproteobacteria epsilobacterarcheota firmicutes and alphaproteobacteria represented about 60 76 of the entire community in all test table s1 the 26 most abundant taxa were common to all treatments and represented about 50 70 of the entire microbial community of the sediment table 1 a the most enriched taxa in all treatments belonged to the phylum chloroflexi namely the families dehalococcoidia ab 539 j10 and anaerolineaceae 8 table 1a but their exact metabolism remains uncertain wasmund et al 2014 matturro et al 2017 however more than half of such abundant taxa 14 out of 26 referred to microorganisms well known for using s species either as electron donor in the form of h2s thiosulphate s2o3 2 sulphite so3 2 or elemental sulphur s8 i e

gene sequences on the snorkels surface in both snorkel treatments on the contrary some of the most enriched taxa in sediments were poorly represented on graphite rods e g uncultured anaerolineaceae dehalococcoidia ab 539 j10 sulfurovum and desulfatiglans log2fc 1 7 relative abundance on rods 2 5 table 1b a few taxa were only detected on rods and not in sediments i e leucobacter rhodococcus hydrogenophaga among these leucobacter rhodococcus appeared to be more abundant in the snorkel cable bacteria treatment 4 discussion 4 1 cable bacteria this study presents the first evidence of a cause effect relationship between cable bacteria and enhanced microbial oil degradation microbial oxidation of alkanes proceeds through the beta oxidation pathway of fatty acids none of the genes encoding for beta oxidation related enzymes are present in sequenced cable bacterial genomes kjeldsen et al 2019 as such a direct engagement of cable bacteria in alkanes degradation is presently ruled out h2s oxidation by cable bacteria is expected to increase the concentration of so4 2 in the porewater risgaard petersen et al 2012 increase in so4 2 availability due to cable bacteria activity has been hypothesized to stimulate toluene degradation in aquifer sediments locally depleted in so4 2 müller et al 2016 on the contrary our data indicate a net decrease in so4 2 concentration in cores with cable bacteria at the end of the incubation such a decrease however was marginal as so4 2 concentration remained above 15 mm cable bacteria expected benefit on petroleum hc oxidizing so4 2 reducing microorganisms appears instead to reside in their capacity to scavenge h2s colonization of the cores by cable bacteria in fact resulted in h2s depletion in the top two cm of sediments within the first two weeks of incubation followed by slow h2s re accumulation later in the incubation fig 1c this temporal evolution mirrors cable bacteria population dynamics peak at two three weeks and later decaying previously reported in sediments from the same station not contaminated with petroleum hc schauer et al 2014 confirming their predominant role in controlling h2s removal in the surface sediment moreover besides removing h2s generated from so4 2 reduction the metabolism of cable bacteria favours the dissolution and consequent re oxidation of h2s from the fes mineral pool risgaard petersen et al 2012 increased fes dissolution in the cable bacteria treatments was indicated by the significant depletion of avs in principle h2s scavenging by cable bacteria could affect the energetics of so4 2 driven anaerobic oxidation of petroleum hc to co2 thermodynamic calculations however shows that under environmental conditions that are representative of the herein described experiments product removal would only have a marginal effect on the gibbs free energy of the reaction which remained largely exergonic even at h2s concentrations exceeding 1 mm fig s3 accordingly it is more likely that h2s removal enhanced oil degradation by so4 2 reducing bacteria via relieving toxicity and or inhibitory effects induced by this metabolite reis et al 1992 4 2 snorkel the application of the snorkel accelerated alkane degradation by 24 compared to the control this occurred within only seven weeks 49 days a much shorter time with respect to previous reports i e 175 days cruz viggi et al 2015 viggi et al 2017 differently from previous studies where the incubations were conducted under stagnant water our incubation was performed under gentle stirring suggesting a more rapid impact of the snorkel under environmental relevant conditions where advection contributes to the transport of o2 to the cathode in the present set up sediment volume 30 cm3 ray around the graphite rod 2 5 cm the concentration of alkanes preferentially bound to sediment particles and insoluble minerals avs decreased substantially compared to control sediment figs 2 3e indicating that the snorkel impacts an area well beyond its immediate proximity sediment microprofiles describe an impact on solutes at 2 cm distance from the snorkel such distance is compatible with molecular diffusion within the experiment period e g 1 3 cm d 1 for hs boudreau 1997 suggesting that the enhanced alkanes biodegradation was presumably mediated by the alteration of the redox chemistry of solutes in the sediment the impact of the snorkel on petroleum hc degradation has been previously related to its ability to promote so4 2 reduction coupled to petroleum hc oxidation or potentially to the oxidation of petroleum hc fermentation products such as h2 and acetate matturro et al 2017 viggi et al 2017 stimulation of so4 2 reduction may be due to enhanced oxidation of h2s to so4 2 s8 directly on the rod cruz viggi et al 2015 or coupled to feooh reduction with consequent re oxidation of fe2 on the electrode viggi et al 2017 we indeed detected a net production of so4 2 when applying snorkels however as discussed above section 4 1 microbial kinetics may not be impacted in marine sediments carrying high so4 2 concentrations as for cable bacteria the snorkel induced a remarkable depletion of h2s removal of h2s has been previously shown to stimulate so4 2 reducing bacteria reis et al 1992 and scavenging of h2s by a bioanode poised at 300 mv vs she was proposed to stimulate so4 2 driven degradation of toluene daghio et al 2016 thus as discussed for cable bacteria h2s removal rather than so4 2 recycling should account for the enhanced microbial oil degradation observed with snorkels further to removing h2s the snorkel could have also contributed to the removal of petroleum hc fermentation products namely acetate and hydrogen with this reaction being catalysed by electroactive bacteria using the portion of the electrode that is buried in the sediment as the terminal electron acceptor while the removal of h2s has a limited impact on the gibbs free energy of the direct petroleum hc oxidation to co2 by so4 2 reducing bacteria thermodynamic modelling indicates that maintaining low acetate and h2 concentrations in the sediment is likely to promote the upstream fermentation of petroleum hc fig s4 collectively these calculations suggest that in principle the snorkel may enhance petroleum hc degradation also by removing fermentation products and in turn serving as a solid syntrophic partner in the fermentative degradation process as cable bacteria can use propionate vasquez cardenas et al 2015 and plausibly other small chain organic substrates as carbon source a similar mechanism could be expected in sediment colonized by cable bacteria oxidation of fe2 on the electrode did not appear to play an important role in h2s oxidation in sharp contrast to what previously suggested viggi et al 2017 this process is expected to decrease the concentration of fe2 in the porewater whereas we detected a net production of fe2 in the presence of the snorkel fig 3f the increase of fe2 was linked to the dissolution of fes minerals as induced by the acid forming anodic oxidation of h2s on the electrode in agreement with ph and avs data fig 3b and e under such fe2 forming conditions h2s oxidation via feooh reduction would not be favoured but rather inhibited the net removal of h2s in our incubation has thus to be ascribed to its oxidation on the snorkel such difference between the two studies is likely due to the inherent geochemical features of the sediment with the electron transfer prevalently mediated by iron cycling in iron oxides rich less sulphidic freshwater sediment and by sulphur cycling in sulphidic fes mineral rich marine sediment overall this data is descriptive of the snorkel as a highly plastic system supporting electron scavenging along multiple pathways able to accelerate petroleum hc degradation under different conditions 4 3 cable bacteria snorkel when both cable bacteria and snorkel were applied together the final alkane biodegradation was the sum of what obtained with either system alone indicating no competition for reductants between the two ldet systems notably the estimated anodic surface area for snorkel and cable bacteria was comparable 14 8 vs 17 7 cm2 suggestive of a direct relation between anodic surface and alkane biodegradation capacity irrespective of the nature of the system applied the simultaneous presence of snorkel and cable bacteria improved the removal of electrons via ldet from the deeper sediment layers as shown by the enhanced h2s removal and increased redox potential compared to the treatments where the systems were test individually fig 3a and c the ph so4 2 and fe2 data indicate that the snorkel favoured cable bacteria metabolism deeper ph minima fig 3b are representative of an extended cable bacteria activity over a thicker sediment layer compared to the cable bacteria alone meaning a larger volume of influence of cable bacteria the increase in the so4 2 and fe2 sediment pools compared to the snorkel alone indicates that after seven weeks cable bacteria were still contributing to the oxidation of reduced s species both from the dissolved and mineral fes pool contrary to when they were applied alone the mechanisms by which snorkels maintain a more active cable bacteria population is unclear owing to snorkels cable bacteria may be forced to grow as longer filaments to keep contact with the deepening sulphidic front alternatively cable bacteria and snorkel may interact to complete h2s oxidation a recent genome mapping reports that cable bacteria can oxidize h2s to s8 followed by either s8 oxidation to so4 2 or disproportionation to so4 2 and h2s kjeldsen et al 2019 abiotic electrochemical oxidation of h2s on the electrode is expected to produce s8 rabaey et al 2006 dutta et al 2008 which could in turn feed cable bacteria filamentous desulfobulbaceae were recently reported anchored to the anode of a sediment microbial fuel cell reimers et al 2017 suggesting that cable bacteria may also use the electrode as electron acceptors we detected a few 16s rrna gene sequences of ca electrothrix on the surface of graphite rods in the snorkel cables treatment relative abundance 0 13 but no cable bacteria were observed on rod s samples via scanning electron microscopy further ph maxima detected below the sediment water interface after seven weeks suggest that cable bacteria maintained direct access to o2 along with cable bacteria the role of other microorganisms in catalyzing all the oxidative steps from h2s to so4 2 in the presence of snorkels remains unclear most of the abundant taxa in our sediments are common to oil degrading communities e g sulfurimonas rubin blum et al 2014 tian et al 2017 desulfocapsa ramos padron

alkanes degradation how they interact with snorkels and cable bacteria requires further investigation a core community of 11 taxa was selectively enriched on the snorkels surface 50 of the whole community colonizing snorkels many of which featured a s metabolism arcobacter is typically detected under h2s dronen et al 2014 roalkvam et al 2015 or s8 voordouw et al 1996 oxidizing conditions magnetovibrio oxidizes h2s and s2o3 2 and can either use o2 or nitrous oxide n2o as electron acceptor sulfitobacter is rather ubiquitous in marine environments and most species oxidize so3 2 ivanova

diverse taxa which are deeply involved in s cycling pujalte et al 2014 reguera and kashefi 2019 with the exception of sneathiella marinicella and the recently proposed bradymonadales all other taxa enriched on snorkels were detected on anodes as biofilms or axenic cultures i e arcobacter fedorovich et al 2009 song et al 2017 magnetovibrio matturro et al 2017 sulfitobacter parot et al 2011 erable

et al 2017 desulfuromonadales reguera and kashefi 2019 the selective enrichment on bioelectrochemical snorkels of these taxa is thus suggestive of a syntrophy in the frame of so4 2 reducing oil degrading metabolism taking advantage of ldet for the removal oxidation of reduced s species 5 conclusions the present data indicate that cable bacteria support microbial petroleum hc oxidizing so4 2 reducing microorganisms by alleviating the accumulation of a toxic product i e h2s both from the dissolved and mineral fes pool cable bacteria thus pull microbial oil metabolism towards a faster oxidation accelerating sediments decontamination their impacts appears limited in time peak at 2 4 weeks and space 1 5 cm depth however their widespread distribution potentially high cell number i e 4 x 108 cell cm 3 see schauer et al 2014 and substantial impact on the top sediment the one initially most impacted by petroleum hc deposition after a spill are suggestive of a previously unrecognized role in petroleum hc decontamination in the environment alkane degradation was highest in the co presence of cable bacteria and the snorkel in the presence of the snorkel cable bacteria expand their volume of influence and possibly their life span thus our data indicate that application of a non polarized electrode i e the snorkel to oil contaminated marine sediments did not simply mediate the removal of negative charges convoyed via diffusion of redox species to the rod rather it facilitated the activity of specific microbial members particularly cable bacteria comprehensively doubling the

18088,degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons hc in sediments is often limited by the availability of electron acceptors by allowing long distance electron transport ldet between anoxic sediments and oxic overlying water bioelectrochemical snorkels may stimulate the regeneration of sulphate in the anoxic sediment thereby accelerating petroleum hc degradation cable bacteria can also mediate ldet between anoxic and oxic sediment layers and thus theoretically stimulate petroleum hc degradation here we quantitatively assessed the impact of cable bacteria and snorkels on the degradation of alkanes in marine sediment from aarhus bay denmark after seven weeks cable bacteria and snorkels accelerated alkanes degradation by 24 and 25 respectively compared to control sediment with no cable bacteria nor snorkel the combination of snorkels and cable bacteria further enhanced alkanes degradation 46 higher degradation rates were sustained by ldet induced sulphide removal rather than as initially hypothesized sulphate regeneration cable bacteria are thus overlooked players in the self healing capacity of crude oil contaminated sediments and may inspire novel remediation treatments upon hydrocarbon spillage graphical abstract image 1 keywords cable bacteria snorkel sediment hydrocarbon long distance electron transport remediation 1 introduction microbial oil degradation in sediments is often limited by the availability of electron acceptors e g meckenstock et al 2015 in impermeable coastal and shelf sediment the mass transport of solutes from the water is governed by slow molecular diffusion which restricts the availability of electron acceptors such as oxygen o2 and nitrate no3 to the topmost millimeters fenchel and jørgensen 1977 glud 2008 sulphate so4 2 may penetrate centimetres to meters into marine sediments and thus despite being a less favourable electron acceptor may account for a large fraction of organic matter degradation jørgensen 2006 in addition to diffusion from the water so4 2 can be regenerated within the anoxic sediment via the re oxidation of sulphide h2s and other reduced sulphur species with insoluble iron fe and manganese mn oxides serving as electron acceptor as these minerals are ultimately formed under oxic conditions in the absence of sediment mixing by bioturbating organisms h2s re oxidation is constrained to the proximity of oxic anoxic interfaces in petroleum hc contaminated sediment the high demand of so4 2 by oil degrading microorganisms may exceed the rate of so4 2 supply from the water and via h2s oxidation potentially leading to local so4 2 limitation supply limitations and the less favourable thermodynamic of so4 2 may account for a long persistence of petroleum hc in the anoxic compartment of marine sediments e g reddy et al 2002 peterson et al 2003 culbertson et al 2008 a bioelectrochemical snorkel is an electrically conductive non polarized material e g graphite platinum stain less steel applied to short circuit redox gradients erable et al 2011 hoareau et al 2019 snorkels offer a preferential route for electrons to move from highly reduced to oxidized zones where electrons can react with o2 to generate water this electron flow may occur over centimetres distances and thus may enable microorganisms the remote access to otherwise out of reach o2 eventually resulting in enhanced oxidation rates under anaerobic conditions the application of snorkels in petroleum hc contaminated marine sediment resulted in improved microbial hc degradation in combination with increased so4 2 availability indicating that the snorkel enhanced so4 2 regeneration via promoting h2s oxidation on the electrode cruz viggi et al 2015 the detection of ferric iron fe3 minerals on the surface of snorkels applied in riverine sediments viggi et al 2017 suggested that the re oxidation of h2s to so4 2 may also occur via reduction of fe oxides with the produced ferrous iron fe2 scavenged by the snorkel despite these studies show that snorkels can accelerate petroleum hc biodegradation in sediments the biogeochemical mechanism that controls the transfer of electrons from the hc to snorkels remains to a large extent uncertain and may vary from site to site owing to their ability to access remote electron acceptors and stimulate regeneration of so4 2 at depth risgaard petersen et al 2012 cable bacteria can be considered the biological analogue of a snorkel cable bacteria are filamentous desulfobulbaceae able to mediate electric currents thereby coupling anodic h2s oxidation at a few centimetres depth with cathodic o2 or no3 reduction close to the sediment water interface nielsen et al 2010 pfeffer et al 2012 marzocchi et al 2014 cable bacteria were reported from a wide range of sediments e g risgaard petersen et al 2015 burdorf et al 2017 marzocchi et al 2018 including oil contaminated sites müller et al 2016 matturro et al 2017 because of their ability to mediate long distance electron transport ldet they have been hypothesized to stimulate petroleum hc degradation by functioning as snorkels however a cause effect relationship between the activity of cable bacteria and petroleum hc degradation has not been so far demonstrated in the present study we quantitatively assessed the impact of such biological cable bacteria and engineered snorkel ldet systems deployed alone and in combination on the degradation of petroleum hc in marine sediments from aarhus bay denmark moreover we comparatively investigated their respective geochemical imprints with a focus on sulphur s and iron fe cycling and their impact on the benthic microbial community 2 methods 2 1 sediment sampling and pre treatment sediment was collected from aarhus bay denmark at station m5 56 06 20 n 10 27 48 e depth 30 m which is known to host cable bacteria marzocchi et al 2014 using a box corer on site the upper 10 12 cm of sediment were discarded to exclude large shells and stones that might interfere with the microprofiling measurements see section 2 2 the underlying sulfidic sediment was sealed in airtight bags brought to the laboratory and stored at 15 c within a few weeks the bags were opened and the sediment was sieved mesh size 0 5 mm homogenised and contaminated with crude oil statfjord oil sediment contamination to a final concentration of 1 v w was performed as in viggi et al 2015 the contaminated sediment was then packed into 12 glass liners 4 3 8 cm diam x height four treatments were prepared to discern the individual and combined impact of cable bacteria and

similarly to pfeffer et al 2012 compared to the original method we applied glass fiber instead of the polycarbonate filters to avoid adsorption of oil hc to the filter material and applied two filters

filters to avoid filter damage sediment was sampled at the beginning two days after contamination and at the end of the incubation for sampling sediment cores were removed from the aquaria and the sediment was extracted from the liners under n2 atmosphere and homogenised approx 1 g of sediment was snap frozen 80 c for later 16s rrna extraction samples for fluorescence in situ hybridization fish

geochemical imprint and σh2s dynamics throughout the incubation after two weeks of incubation σh2s and ph depth profiles in the cable bacteria cores showed the typical signature for cable bacteria activity i e build up of a 2 cm thick zone devoid of both o2 and σh2s intense proton consumption in the oxic portion of the sediment ph maxima compatible with cathodic o2 consumption and acidification in the suboxic zone compatible with anodic h2s oxidation fig 1 a e g nielsen et al 2010 meysman et al 2015 snorkel cable bacteria cores showed analogous patterns indicating the presence of cable bacteria although with two remarkable differences a 40 higher attenuation of the upward flux of σh2s 6 5 vs 3 8 μmol m 2 h 1 and a less pronounced ph maxima fig 1a this is descriptive of a contribution of the snorkel to ldet that is σh2s consumption over a deeper sediment horizon and cathodic o2 reduction mainly occurring in the overlying water which did not contribute to the ph increase in the subsurface sediment over the course of the incubation in the snorkel cable bacteria treatment the sulphidic front depth with σh2s 1 μm deepened monotonically throughout the seven week period moving from 1 0 cm below the sediment water interface at time zero to 2 5 cm depth at the end of the incubation fig 1b in the cable bacteria treatment the σh2s concentration showed a less linear trend fig 1c within the first two weeks the sulphidic front moved from 1 0 to 2 15 cm in the following two weeks the sulphidic front remained steady however σh2s accumulated in the deeper sediment layers 2 15 cm after four weeks the continued σh2s accumulation in the deeper sediment affected the sulphidic front which raised progressively and realigned with the depth recorded at the beginning of the experiment i e 0 95 cm 3 2 alkanes degradation at the end of the incubation at the end of the seven week incubation period the concentration of alkanes in controls 0 114 mg g 1 dry weight dw was not significantly lower compared to the beginning of the experiment t test p 0 2 n 6 fig 2 two way anova analysis indicated significant variations due to the factors snorkel and cable bacteria p 0 01 in the snorkel and in the cable bacteria treatments the concentration of alkanes dropped by 24 and 25 respectively compared to the control tukey test p 0 04 the concentration of alkanes in the snorkel cable bacteria treatment was significantly lower compared to controls i e 54 tukey test p 0 01 and to the snorkel and the cable bacteria treatments tukey test p 0 02 3 3 impact of cable bacteria and snorkel on sediment biogeochemistry at the end of the incubation at the end of the incubation period σh2s was detected in the control at 1 0 cm depth fig 3 a with the concentration increasing to 100 μm at 2 7 cm depth in the cable bacteria treatment σh2s was measured at 1 1 cm depth and reached concentrations 100 μm at 3 3 cm depth in the snorkel treatment σh2s was below detection limit up to a depth of 2 0 cm and at the bottom of the profile 4 0 cm depth σh2s only reached 37 μm 5 4 s e m the snorkel cable bacteria treatment was the most efficient in maintaining low σh2s levels as σh2s was not detected to 2 6 cm and it only reached 14 μm 6 6 at 4 0 cm depth in the control the ph decreased with depth from the overlying water value of 8 6 reaching a minimum of 7 77 0 04 at 1 05 cm the snorkel treatment had a similar pattern but maintained lower values starting from a 0 6 cm depth minimum of 7 61 0 02 at 1 75 cm as opposed to these treatments those including cable bacteria showed subsurface peaks with maximum value of 8 5 at 0 2 0 3 cm depth and reached lower minimum values i e 7 3 7 4 fig 3b in the snorkel cable bacteria the ph minimum was detected at higher depth 2 4 cm compared to the cable bacteria treatment 1 05 cm redox profiles mirrored those of the σh2s with increasingly positive values following the order control cable bacteria snorkel snorkel cable bacteria indicative of a progressively less reduced environment when applying ldet systems alone or in combination fig 3c compared to the control all the three treatments resulted in a tangible increase in redox potential between 80 and 150 mv in the 0 5 1 5 cm depth interval deeper in the sediment the impact of cable bacteria alone on redox potential attenuated and values tended to realign to the control whereas in both snorkel treatments values remained higher compared to control 50 to 60 mv at 4 cm the presence of the snorkel resulted in higher concentration of so4 2 compared to the treatments without it two way anova p 0 01 fig 3d in the snorkel treatment so4 2 increased only slightly compared to the control however the difference was not significant tukey test p 0 39 the snorkel cable bacteria treatment showed the highest concentration of so4 2 and the difference with the controls resulted significant tukey test p 0 05 such an increase in so4 2 was coupled to a net decrease in avs snorkel cable bacteria vs control tukey test p 0 05 and release of fe2 snorkel cable bacteria vs control tukey test p 0 05 confirming an ongoing fes dissolution and h2s re oxidation to so4 2 sulphate avs and fe2 concentrations in the snorkel treatment with no cable bacteria showed trends analogous to the above described ones although of an attenuated intensity compared to the snorkel cable bacteria treatment only fe2 concentration was significantly higher in the snorkel treatment compared to the control tukey test p 0 05 the so4 2 concentration was lower in the cable bacteria treatment compared to all other treatments tukey test p 0 05 confirming that their activity was decreasing after seven weeks of incubation fig 1c no net increase in fe2 was recorded in the cable bacteria treatment compared to the control however cable bacteria were the only significant factor determining the decrease in avs two way anova p 0 01 the presence of cable bacteria significantly decreased the avs concentration two way anova p 0 01 regardless of the presence of the snorkel the avs concentrations decreased in the order control snorkel cable bacteria snorkel cable bacteria this trend mirrored that for ph minima i e lowest avs concentration observed with lowest ph fig 3b suggesting that fes dissolution was likely driven by acidic forming anodic oxidations mediated by cable bacteria 3 4 impact of cable bacteria and snorkel on bacterial communities at the end of the incubation cable bacteria were detected in the cable bacteria and snorkel cable bacteria treatments at relative abundances of 0 1 but were undetected in the cores with filters i e control and snorkel treatment fish imaging in both cable bacteria treatments confirmed their typical filamentous form that allows them to stretch across the sediment redox zonation to perform ldet fig s2 bacterial phyla composition in sediment cores did not substantially differed as a result of different treatments chloroflexi deltaproteobacteria epsilobacterarcheota firmicutes and alphaproteobacteria represented about 60 76 of the entire community in all test table s1 the 26 most abundant taxa were common to all treatments and represented about 50 70 of the entire microbial community of the sediment table 1 a the most enriched taxa in all treatments belonged to the phylum chloroflexi namely the families dehalococcoidia ab 539 j10 and anaerolineaceae 8 table 1a but their exact metabolism remains uncertain wasmund et al 2014 matturro et al 2017 however more than half of such abundant taxa 14 out of 26 referred to microorganisms well known for using s species either as electron donor in the form of h2s thiosulphate s2o3 2 sulphite so3 2 or elemental sulphur s8 i e

dehalococcoidia ab 539 j10 sulfurovum and desulfatiglans log2fc 1 7 relative abundance on rods 2 5 table 1b a few taxa were only detected on rods and not in sediments i e leucobacter rhodococcus hydrogenophaga among these leucobacter rhodococcus appeared to be more abundant in the snorkel cable bacteria treatment 4 discussion 4 1 cable bacteria this study presents the first evidence of a cause effect relationship between cable bacteria and enhanced microbial oil degradation microbial oxidation of alkanes proceeds through the beta oxidation pathway of fatty acids none of the genes encoding for beta oxidation related enzymes are present in sequenced cable bacterial genomes kjeldsen et al 2019 as such a direct engagement of cable bacteria in alkanes degradation is presently ruled out h2s oxidation by cable bacteria is expected to increase the concentration of so4 2 in the porewater risgaard petersen et al 2012 increase in so4 2 availability due to cable bacteria activity has been hypothesized to stimulate toluene degradation in aquifer sediments locally depleted in so4 2 müller et al 2016 on the contrary our data indicate a net decrease in so4 2 concentration in cores with cable bacteria at the end of the incubation such a decrease however was marginal as so4 2 concentration remained above 15 mm cable bacteria expected benefit on petroleum hc oxidizing so4 2 reducing microorganisms appears instead to reside in their capacity to scavenge h2s colonization of the cores by cable bacteria in fact resulted in h2s depletion in the top two cm of sediments within the first two weeks of incubation followed by slow h2s re accumulation later in the incubation fig 1c this temporal evolution mirrors cable bacteria population dynamics peak at two three weeks and later decaying previously reported in sediments from the same station not contaminated with petroleum hc schauer et al 2014 confirming their predominant role in controlling h2s removal in the surface sediment moreover besides removing h2s generated from so4 2 reduction the metabolism of cable bacteria favours the dissolution and consequent re oxidation of h2s from the fes mineral pool risgaard petersen et al 2012 increased fes dissolution in the cable bacteria treatments was indicated by the significant depletion of avs in principle h2s scavenging by cable bacteria could affect the energetics of so4 2 driven anaerobic oxidation of petroleum hc to co2 thermodynamic calculations however shows that under environmental conditions that are representative of the herein described experiments product removal would only have a marginal effect on the gibbs free energy of the reaction which remained largely exergonic even at h2s concentrations exceeding 1 mm fig s3 accordingly it is more likely that h2s removal enhanced oil degradation by so4 2 reducing bacteria via relieving toxicity and or inhibitory effects induced by this metabolite reis et al 1992 4 2 snorkel the application of the snorkel accelerated alkane degradation by 24 compared to the control this occurred within only seven weeks 49 days a much shorter time with respect to previous reports i e 175 days cruz viggi et al 2015 viggi et al 2017 differently from previous studies where the incubations were conducted under stagnant water our incubation was performed under gentle stirring suggesting a more rapid impact of the snorkel under environmental relevant conditions where advection contributes to the transport of o2 to the cathode in the present set up sediment volume 30 cm3 ray around the graphite rod 2 5 cm the concentration of alkanes preferentially bound to sediment particles and insoluble minerals avs decreased substantially compared to control sediment figs 2 3e indicating that the snorkel impacts an area well beyond its immediate proximity sediment microprofiles describe an impact on solutes at 2 cm distance from the snorkel such distance is compatible with molecular diffusion within the experiment period e g 1 3 cm d 1 for hs boudreau 1997 suggesting that the enhanced alkanes biodegradation was presumably mediated by the alteration of the redox chemistry of solutes in the sediment the impact of the snorkel on petroleum hc degradation has been previously related to its ability to promote so4 2 reduction coupled to petroleum hc oxidation or potentially to the oxidation of petroleum hc fermentation products such as h2 and acetate matturro et al 2017 viggi et al 2017 stimulation of so4 2 reduction may be due to enhanced oxidation of h2s to so4 2 s8 directly on the rod cruz viggi et al 2015 or coupled to feooh reduction with consequent re oxidation of fe2 on the electrode viggi et al 2017 we indeed detected a net production of so4 2 when applying snorkels however as discussed above section 4 1 microbial kinetics may not be impacted in marine sediments carrying high so4 2 concentrations as for cable bacteria the snorkel induced a remarkable depletion of h2s removal of h2s has been previously shown to stimulate so4 2 reducing bacteria reis et al 1992 and scavenging of h2s by a bioanode poised at 300 mv vs she was proposed to stimulate so4 2 driven degradation of toluene daghio et al 2016 thus as discussed for cable bacteria h2s removal rather than so4 2 recycling should account for the enhanced microbial oil degradation observed with snorkels further to removing h2s the snorkel could have also contributed to the removal of petroleum hc fermentation products namely acetate and hydrogen with this reaction being catalysed by electroactive bacteria using the portion of the electrode that is buried in the sediment as the terminal electron acceptor while the removal of h2s has a limited impact on the gibbs free energy of the direct petroleum hc oxidation to co2 by so4 2 reducing bacteria thermodynamic modelling indicates that maintaining low acetate and h2 concentrations in the sediment is likely to promote the upstream fermentation of petroleum hc fig s4 collectively these calculations suggest that in principle the snorkel may enhance petroleum hc degradation also by removing fermentation products and in turn serving as a solid syntrophic partner in the fermentative degradation process as cable bacteria can use propionate vasquez cardenas et al 2015 and plausibly other small chain organic substrates as carbon source a similar mechanism could be expected in sediment colonized by cable bacteria oxidation of fe2 on the electrode did not appear to play an important role in h2s oxidation in sharp contrast to what previously suggested viggi et al 2017 this process is expected to decrease the concentration of fe2 in the porewater whereas we detected a net production of fe2 in the presence of the snorkel fig 3f the increase of fe2 was linked to the dissolution of fes minerals as induced by the acid forming anodic oxidation of h2s on the electrode in agreement with ph and avs data fig 3b and e under such fe2 forming conditions h2s oxidation via feooh reduction would not be favoured but rather inhibited the net removal of h2s in our incubation has thus to be ascribed to its oxidation on the snorkel such difference between the two studies is likely due to the inherent geochemical features of the sediment with the electron transfer prevalently mediated by iron cycling in iron oxides rich less sulphidic freshwater sediment and by sulphur cycling in sulphidic fes mineral rich marine sediment overall this data is descriptive of the snorkel as a highly plastic system supporting electron scavenging along multiple pathways able to accelerate petroleum hc degradation under different conditions 4 3 cable bacteria snorkel when both cable bacteria and snorkel were applied together the final alkane biodegradation was the sum of what obtained with either system alone indicating no competition for reductants between the two ldet systems notably the estimated anodic surface area for snorkel and cable bacteria was comparable 14 8 vs 17 7 cm2 suggestive of a direct relation between anodic surface and alkane biodegradation capacity irrespective of the nature of the system applied the simultaneous presence of snorkel and cable bacteria improved the removal of electrons via ldet from the deeper sediment layers as shown by the enhanced h2s removal and increased redox potential compared to the treatments where the systems were test individually fig 3a and c the ph so4 2 and fe2 data indicate that the snorkel favoured cable bacteria metabolism deeper ph minima fig 3b are representative of an extended cable bacteria activity over a thicker sediment layer compared to the cable bacteria alone meaning a larger volume of influence of cable bacteria the increase in the so4 2 and fe2 sediment pools compared to the snorkel alone indicates that after seven weeks cable bacteria were still contributing to the oxidation of reduced s species both from the dissolved and mineral fes pool contrary to when they were applied alone the mechanisms by which snorkels maintain a more active cable bacteria population is unclear owing to snorkels cable bacteria may be forced to grow as longer filaments to keep contact with the deepening sulphidic front alternatively cable bacteria and snorkel may interact to complete h2s oxidation a recent genome mapping reports that cable bacteria can oxidize h2s to s8 followed by either s8 oxidation to so4 2 or disproportionation to so4 2 and h2s kjeldsen et al 2019 abiotic electrochemical oxidation of h2s on the electrode is expected to produce s8 rabaey et al 2006 dutta et al 2008 which could in turn feed cable bacteria filamentous desulfobulbaceae were recently reported anchored to the anode of a sediment microbial fuel cell reimers et al 2017 suggesting that cable bacteria may also use the electrode as electron acceptors we detected a few 16s rrna gene sequences of ca electrothrix on the surface of graphite rods in the snorkel cables treatment relative abundance 0 13 but no cable bacteria were observed on rod s samples via scanning electron microscopy further ph maxima detected below the sediment water interface after seven weeks suggest that cable bacteria maintained direct access to o2 along with cable bacteria the role of other microorganisms in catalyzing all the oxidative steps from h2s to so4 2 in the presence of snorkels remains unclear most of the abundant taxa in our sediments are common to oil degrading communities e g sulfurimonas rubin blum et al 2014 tian et al 2017 desulfocapsa ramos padron et al 2011 aktas et al 2017 magnetovibrio matturro et al 2017 arcobacter prabagaran et al 2007 scoma et al 2019 sulfitobacter krolicka et al 2017 gontigaki 2018 and may account for the observed alkanes degradation how they interact with snorkels and cable bacteria requires further investigation a core community of 11 taxa was selectively enriched on the snorkels surface 50 of the whole community colonizing snorkels many of which featured a s metabolism arcobacter is typically detected under h2s dronen et al 2014 roalkvam et al 2015 or s8 voordouw et al 1996 oxidizing conditions magnetovibrio oxidizes h2s and s2o3 2 and can either use o2 or nitrous oxide n2o as electron acceptor sulfitobacter is rather ubiquitous in marine environments and most species oxidize so3 2 ivanova et al 2004 desulfuromusa typically reduces s8 to h2s but is unable to use so4 2 s2o3 2 or so3 2 as electron acceptor liesack and finster 1994 the rhodobacteraceae and desulfuromonadales are widely diverse taxa which are deeply involved in s cycling pujalte et al 2014 reguera and kashefi 2019 with the exception of sneathiella marinicella and the recently proposed bradymonadales all other taxa enriched on snorkels were detected on anodes as biofilms or axenic cultures i e arcobacter fedorovich et al 2009 song et al 2017 magnetovibrio matturro et al 2017 sulfitobacter parot et al 2011 erable et al 2017 desulfuromusa liu et al 2007 carmona martinez et al 2015 ardicantena maritima type strain of the ardicantenales kawaichi et al 2018 pseudomonas rabaey et al 2004 rhodobacteraceae matturro et al 2017 desulfuromonadales reguera and kashefi 2019 the selective enrichment on bioelectrochemical snorkels of these taxa is thus suggestive of a syntrophy in the frame of so4 2 reducing oil degrading metabolism taking advantage of ldet for the removal oxidation of reduced s species 5 conclusions the present data indicate that cable bacteria support microbial petroleum hc oxidizing so4 2 reducing microorganisms by alleviating the accumulation of a toxic product i e h2s both from the dissolved and mineral fes pool cable bacteria thus pull microbial oil metabolism towards a faster oxidation accelerating sediments decontamination their impacts appears limited in time peak at 2 4 weeks and space 1 5 cm depth however their widespread distribution potentially high cell number i e 4 x 108 cell cm 3 see schauer et al 2014 and substantial impact on the top sediment the one initially most impacted by petroleum hc deposition after a spill are suggestive of a previously unrecognized role in petroleum hc decontamination in the environment alkane degradation was highest in the co presence of cable bacteria and the snorkel in the presence of the snorkel cable bacteria expand their volume of influence and possibly their life span thus our data indicate that application of a non polarized electrode i e the snorkel to oil contaminated marine sediments did not simply mediate the removal of negative charges convoyed via diffusion of redox species to the rod rather it facilitated the activity of specific microbial members particularly cable bacteria comprehensively doubling the alkane biodegradation capacity of the whole microbial community unveiling the mechanistic interaction of these microorganisms with electroactive materials is of primary importance in the

18089,in this study a semi batch bench scale uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 advanced oxidation process system was used to investigate how typical groundwater quality parameters ph alkalinity natural organic matter nom nitrate and iron influence the treatment of 1 4 dioxane deionized di water spiked with 1 4 dioxane 100 μg l 1 treated using h2o2 10 mg l 1 in a commercially available uv system 40 w low pressure lamp showed an uv fluence based first order rate constant k and electrical energy per order eeo of 4 32 10 3 cm2 mj 1 and 0 15 kwh m 3 order 1 respectively the most abundant byproduct generated in spiked di water was oxalic acid up to 55 μg l 1 followed by formic and acetic acids the k showed no significant difference at ph ranging from 5 to 7 and at low alkalinity concentrations 20 mg caco3 l 1 typical of sandy aquifers the k declined by up to 85 with increasing nom concentration elevated production up to 400 increase of aldehydes and organic acids was observed in nom spiked water implying that nom is a significant byproduct precursor during uv h2o2 treatment high no3 concentration 10 mg n l 1 in source water reduced the k by 25 while no significant impact was observed at lower concentrations 2 mg n l 1 addition of fe ii at 0 5 mg l 1 resulted in an instantaneous fenton reaction assisted removal of 10 1 4 dioxane in the presence of h2o2 but did not enhance the performance of uv h2o2 treatment over time in contrast both fe ii and fe iii addition lowered the k by 15 27 the decline of k observed in these experiments was attributed to reduced uvt fe oh radical scavenging ph or both no3 nom treatment of groundwater samples collected from three 1 4 dioxane contaminated wells located in long island ny showed k values of 13 40 lower than what was observed for di water due to radical scavenging from a combination of high no3 and nom in the samples a multiple linear regression model developed using water quality data as model input showed good agreement with field observations paired t test p 0 05 in predicting k for the removal of 1 4 dioxane from groundwater this study provides the first systematic evaluation of the impacts of groundwater quality on uv h2o2 process to remove environmentally relevant levels of 1 4 dioxane and reports standardized performance related parameters to aid in the design and evaluation of full scale systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation processes uv hydrogen peroxide treatment 1 4 dioxane groundwater treatment byproducts 1 introduction 1 4 dioxane c4h8o2 is a widely used solvent for a variety of industrial applications such as in the manufacture of chlorinated solvents e g 1 1 1 trichloroethane in products like adhesives sealants paint strippers dyes greases varnishes waxes and in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals zenker et al 2003 in addition to its intentional uses 1 4 dioxane is also found as an impurity in consumer products such as deodorants shampoos and cosmetics and as a byproduct during the manufacture of polyethylene terephthalate pet plastic mohr et al 2010 zenker et al 2003 1 4 dioxane is classified as a probable human carcinogen based on evidence of carcinogenicity from animal studies showing increased incidences of nasal cavity liver and gallbladder tumors following oral exposure atsdr 2012 wastewater discharge unintended spills and historical disposal practices have led to the widespread contamination of 1 4 dioxane in drinking water sources across the u s analysis of the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule 3 ucmr3 data from the u s epa revealed that 1 4 dioxane was detectable at over 4000 sites across the u s adamson et al 2017 and more than 600 sites were above the health based drinking water reference level established by the u s epa 0 35 μg l 1 representing one in a million cancer risk u s epa 2013 in new york state nys alone 516 sites were found above the detection limit 0 07 μg l 1 with 238 sites showing 1 4 dioxane concentrations higher than 0 35 μg l 1 as per ucmr3 data currently there is no established federal maximum contaminant level mcl for 1 4 dioxane in drinking water but several states have their own clean up or notification levels ranging from 0 3 to 70 μg l 1 recently the nys department of health has approved the nation s first 1 4 dioxane standard at 1 μg l 1 parts per billion ppb in drinking water nys government 2019 1 4 dioxane is highly persistent soluble in water resistant to bio degradation non volatile and has a low sorption coefficient making it extremely difficult to remove from water using conventional water treatment processes e g by activated carbon air stripping etc zenker et al 2003 advanced oxidation processes aops are very effective at oxidizing 1 4 dioxane in drinking waters among various aops ultra violet uv based aop including uv h2o2 antoniou and andersen 2015 coleman et al 2007 kim et al 2006 martijn et al 2010 maurino et al 1997 stefan and bolton 1998 uv s2o8

vis ferrioxalate h2o2 safarzadeh amiri et al 1997 and the photoelectro peroxone pep process shen et al 2017 have been extensively studied a few studies have examined the generation of intermediates e g aldehydes organic acids and the mono and diformate esters of ethylene glycol during uv h2o2 treatment of 1 4 dioxane and have proposed possible degradation pathways maurino et al 1997 stefan and bolton 1998 li et al 2018 further investigated the cyto and geno toxicity of known intermediates from 1 4 dioxane degradation during uv based aop treatment uv h2o2 uv s2o8 2 and uv nh2cl and suggested that formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde were the most cyto and geno toxic byproducts although several studies have shown a good efficacy of decomposing 1 4 dioxane through uv based aops summarized in table s1 scaling up or comparing these studies has been a challenge because of i varying experimental conditions ii a lack of standardized reporting of system performance e g electrical energy per order eeo and or uv dose was often not reported and iii a lack of testing performed under environmentally relevant conditions e g high concentrations of 1 4 dioxane at parts per million levels were often tested although one study was performed at environmentally relevant levels of 1 4 dioxane swaim et al 2008 the impact of water quality was not evaluated in the study it is well known that some naturally occurring compounds in groundwater can scavenge radicals that may significantly impact the performance of aops crittenden et al 2012 and thus there is a need to evaluate source water quality impacts on the efficacy of aop treatment of 1 4 dioxane in this study a series of experiments at environmentally relevant conditions were performed to i comprehensively investigate the impact of ph alkalinity nitrate natural organic matter nom and iron on 1 4 dioxane removal ii assess the formation of associated byproducts and iii report variation in performance related parameters eeo and uv fluence based rate constants during bench scale uv h2o2 treatment to the best of our knowledge the impact of fe ferrous and ferric ions alkalinity and nom on uv h2o2 treatment of 1 4 dioxane has not been reported in literature organic acids formic acetic and oxalic acids and aldehydes formaldehyde acetaldehyde and glyoxal were monitored which are known major byproducts formed during aop treatment of 1 4 dioxane stefan and bolton 1998 these compounds are also common byproducts generated during aop treatment of organic compounds e g phenolic compounds alnaizy and akgerman 2000 scheck and frimmel 1995 and hence additionally serve as representative byproducts to assess the relative levels generated from other organics e g nom in groundwater the results from experiments with synthetic source water were further compared with groundwater samples collected from sites contaminated with 1 4 dioxane 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents and aop system settings all chemicals and solvents used in this study were of either certified acs reagent grade or analytical grade with high purity and were purchased from sigma aldrich or fisher scientific deionized water di water elix and ultra pure milli q water 18 2 mω cm were used throughout experiments a schematic diagram of the bench scale aop system is shown in fig 1 the uv reactor was equipped with a low pressure mercury lamp 40 w λ 253 7 nm and purchased from viqua ontario canada the system was operated in a semi batch mode and the flow rate was fixed at 45 l min 1 the volume of the uv reactor was 2 6 l and the contact time was 3 5 s the water reservoir 20 l was cooled in an ice cold water bath to maintain a temperature at 23 3 c during operation the temperature ph and oxidation reduction potential orp in treated water were monitored simultaneously over time using a hach loveland colorado sension mm150 portable meter treated water samples were collected through a sampling port at each time point for subsequent analyses two well established methods atrazine actinometry and the pcba para chlorobenzoic acid method rosenfeldt et al 2006 were used to determine the uv dose rate uv fluence rate and the steady state hydroxyl radical production in the system respectively the calculated average uv fluence rate was 2 63 mw cm 2 and the calculated steady state concentration of hydroxyl radicals oh was 2 x 10 12 m 2 2 experimental design in each experiment 20 l of di water spiked with 100 μg l 1 of 1 4 dioxane and 10 mg l 1 of h2o2 was prepared to evaluate the kinetics of 1 4 dioxane removal and byproducts formation over time the majority of previous studies used higher concentrations of 1 4 dioxane ppm levels during aop treatment table s1 typically observed in heavily contaminated sites e g superfund sites with concentrations as high as 105 μg l 1 adamson et al 2015 anderson et al 2012 but providing less relevance to contaminated drinking water systems that have low parts per billion levels of 1 4 dioxane range detected in drinking water 0 07 34 μg l 1 from ucmr3 data hence an initial 1 4 dioxane concentration of 100 μg l 1 was chosen in this study for its environmental relevance and to facilitate the detection of intermediates byproducts generated during aop treatment the h2o2 dose was selected to match the dose currently being employed in a full scale aop system operated in long island ny aliquots of treated water samples were obtained and analyzed for uv transmittance at 254 nm uvt h2o2 1 4 dioxane aldehydes and organic acids because excess h2o2 in samples may damage analytical instruments 1 mg l 1 of catalase was added to samples to quench h2o2 before all subsequent chemical analyses except h2o2 determination catalase did not introduce any background contamination of target byproducts in control experiments experiments evaluating the impact of various groundwater parameters ph alkalinity nom nitrate and iron were also conducted in di water sulfuric acid 1 n and sodium hydroxide 1 m were used to adjust the initial ph over the range of 5 8 multiple concentrations of nom 1 2 and 10 mg nom l 1 corresponding to 0 5 1 and 5 mg c l 1 nitrate 1 2 and 10 mg n l 1 and alkalinity 5 10 and 20 mg caco3 l 1 ph was adjusted to 7 were examined suwannee river natural organic matter 2r101n purchased from the international humic substances society was used for nom experiments addition of iron species fe2 feso4 and fe3 fecl3 in di water 0 5 mg fe l 1 each was tested separately to assess the possibility of fenton type reactions during uv h2o2 treatment the concentrations of the water quality parameters described above were based on the typical groundwater levels found in sand and gravel aquifers like on long island ny and on the u s epa s secondary drinking water standards i e for fe is 0 3 mg l 1 in addition to the experiments with synthetic source water as described above 1 4 dioxane contaminated groundwater samples from three locations gw1 gw2 and gw3 on long island ny were collected to evaluate aop performance and the impact of the groundwater matrix on the removal of 1 4 dioxane the water quality parameters for the field samples are listed in table s2 each groundwater sample had two treatments one was with only native 1 4 dioxane levels range 5 7 12 9 μg l 1 and the other was spiked with additional 1 4 dioxane at 100 μg l 1 2 3

in addition tetrahydrofuran d 8 thf d 8 was added as an internal standard is to monitor the instrumental stability during analysis a frozen micro extraction fme method li et al 2011 was employed to extract 1 4 dioxane from treated water fme method is a modified liquid liquid extraction technique briefly an 800 μl aliquot of the sample was transferred to a 2 ml centrifuge tube and spiked with is and sur an equal volume 800 μl of dichloromethane was added into the tube the tube was capped firmly shaken for 60 s and was frozen at 80 c for 30 min the top frozen aqueous phase layer was discarded and the bottom organic phase was collected for subsequent analysis by gc ms the average calculated recovery of sur using the fme method was 90 6 n 205 throughout the experiments aldehydes formaldehyde acetaldehyde and glyoxal were analyzed following the modified epa method 8315a in brief samples were buffered and reacted with 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine dnph to form dnph aldehyde derivatives the

a significant level p set at 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 1 4 dioxane breakdown and byproducts formation during uv h2o2 treatment as expected direct uv photolysis of 1 4 dioxane was not observed and h2o2 alone did not degrade 1 4 dioxane fig 2 a in the presence of h2o2 10 mg l 1 along with uv irradiation 1 4 dioxane was rapidly decomposed by 90 in the first 3 5 min uv fluence 550 mj cm 2 and became undetectable after 8 min uv fluence 1260 mj cm 2 of operation fig 2a the calculated first order rate constant was k 1 13 0 13 10 2 s 1 based on the uv fluence rate evaluated in our system the calculated fluence based rate constant k was 4 41 10 3 mj 1 cm2 and the estimated eeo was 0 13 kwh order 1 m 3 table 1 these values were comparable to and in some cases better than previous studies indicating that the bench scale uv h2o2 system was effective in degrading 1 4 dioxane at environmentally relevant parts per billion levels in water for comparison table s1 summarizes previous studies which employed uv h2o2 treatment to remove 1 4 dioxane and reported available data of rate constants 0 03 1 13 10 2 s 1 and 0 46 4 41 10 3 mj 1 cm2 and eeo 0 13 7 4 kwh order 1 m 3 after 30 min of operation 40 of h2o2 was consumed and the corresponding first order rate constant and fluence based rate constants for h2o2 photolysis were 3 0 10 4 s 1 and 1 1 10 4 mj 1 cm2 respectively known byproducts aldehydes and organic acids were detected in treated water samples fig 2b and c acetaldehyde and glyoxal increased over time to a maximum of 5 μg l 1 and 11 μg l 1 respectively at 8 min uv fluence 1260 mj cm 2 but eventually decreased with continued treatment the formation of organic acids was observed after the aldehydes and coincided with the timing at which the ph declined this sequence of byproduct formation was similar to observations reported in a previous study stefan and bolton 1998 by calculating a carbon mass balance over the 30 min experimental time course aldehydes and organic acids accounted for up to 68 of carbon mass derived from 1 4 dioxane at 20 min fig 2d the deficit in carbon mass balance was expected since previous studies have shown the formation of other intermediates like 1 2 ethanediol monoformate 1 2 ethanediol diformate methoxyacetic and glycolic acids not analyzed in this study can account for up to 40 mass of generated byproducts at the early stages of 1 4 dioxane degradation maurino et al 1997 stefan and bolton 1998 the mineralization of simple organic acids to co2 can further explain the deficit in the carbon mass balance at the later stages of aop treatment in a full scale system the typical residence time of water during uv h2o2 treatment is 10 s unpublished information provided by water treatment facility and hence complete mineralization of these byproducts is very unlikely 3 2 effect of ph alkalinity and nitrate the results for 1 4 dioxane removal at different ph alkalinity and nitrate levels are shown in fig 3 and the calculated removal rate constants are presented in table 1 results showed that the removal rate constants did not differ significantly from ph 5 to ph 7 table s4 however the rate constant declined by 40 at ph 8 previous studies have shown a range in the optimal ph for the degradation of various contaminants by uv h2o2 the optimal ph range of 4 10 for phenol alnaizy and akgerman 2000 3 5 5 5 for acid blue 74 dye aleboyeh et al 2005 3 6 for dimethyl phthalate tawabini and al suwaiyan 2004 xu et al 2009 6 8 8 1 for microcystin rr qiao et al 2005 5 8 for n butylparaben and 4 tert octylphenol błędzka et al 2010 10 for chlorpyrifos de oliveira et al 2014 5 9 for roxarsone adak et al 2015 and 3 9 for sulfaquinoxaline sodium liao et al 2016 a recent study showed no significant difference between ph 5 7 and ph 7 0 on 1 4 dioxane removal by uv h2o2 for potable reuse zhang et al 2019b noting that 3 mg l 1 of chloramines were added in the water prior to the treatment the drop in degradation rate constant observed at ph 8 in this study is likely because h2o2 molecules dissociate and form its conjugate base ho2 under alkaline conditions these ho2 anions can further react with non dissociated h2o2 lowering the amount of h2o2 in water which is the primary source of oh furthermore ho2 can also consume oh rapidly rate constant 7 5 x 109 m 1 s 1 christensen et al 1982 to generate superoxide radicals o2 which have less reactivity with organic pollutants bielski et al 1985 additionally the self decomposition rate of h2o2 increases strongly with increasing ph which can result in direct formation of h2o and o2 without involving uv photolysis chu 2001 the addition of alkalinity 5 20 mg caco3 l 1 had no significant impact on 1 4 dioxane removal fig 3b and table 1 there are two likely reasons to explain this observation firstly this result may be due to the low concentrations of alkalinity mainly carbonate species used in this study to mimic typical groundwater alkalinity levels in sandy aquifers however higher amounts of carbonate 100 mg caco3 l 1 have been reported to moderately decrease the degradation of organic contaminants such as sulfaquinoxaline sodium liao et al 2016 and roxarsone nitarsone adak et al 2015 by uv h2o2 in a uv tio2 study the breakdown of 1 4 dioxane was inhibited in the presence of high bicarbonate ions nahco3 214 mg l 1 mehrvar et al 2001 secondly carbonate speciation in solution is critical to oh scavenging at high ph 11 co3 2 is the dominant species which has a higher reaction rate constant with oh k ho co 3 2 3 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 at near neutral ph this study hco3 is the dominant carbonate species and has a much lower reaction rate constant with oh k ho hco 3 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 although carbonate radicals co3 would be produced during oh radical scavenging they show more selectivity and less reactivity toward organic pollutants than oh radicals mazellier et al 2007 mehrvar et al 2001 low concentrations of nitrate 1 and 2 mg n l 1 showed negligible effects on 1 4 dioxane removal efficiency but high nitrate concentration 10 mg n l 1 decreased the removal rate constant by 25 fig 3c table 1 martijn et al 2010 confirmed oh radical scavenging in the presence of nitrate using pcba as a probe compound to partially explain the difference in 1 4 dioxane removal by uv h2o2 compared to coagulation sedimentation filtration csf and ion exchange ultrafiltration ix uf treated waters several studies also reported inhibition in the degradation of diverse organic pollutants by uv h2o2 in the presence of nitrate błędzka et al 2010 liao et al 2016 park et al 2014 this observation can likely be attributable to the combination of direct uv absorption by nitrate and the consumption of oh radicals by nitrite ions produced from direct uv photolysis of nitrate mack and bolton 1999 the uvt was reduced to 0 944 at 10 mg n l 1 corresponding to 15 decline of uv fluence received by the treated water which explains the scavenging effect of high nitrates in water nitrate inhibited degradation is expected to be more pronounced if medium pressure hg lamps are used because higher uv absorbance of nitrate can occur at 300 nm compared to the wavelength of 254 nm used in this study mack and bolton 1999 3 3 effect of nom on uv h2o2 performance the change in ph toc uvt at 254 nm and h2o2 with time for each nom treatment is shown in fig s1 a decrease in ph was observed in all experiments consistent with the observed formation of organic acids fig s1 in the low nom treatments 0 5 and 1 mg c l 1 toc decreased by 50 after 30 min uv fluence 4728 mj cm 2 indicating the effective degradation of organic matter by uv photolysis and oh with higher addition of nom 5 mg c l 1 uvt declined greatly to 0 8 subsequently reducing h2o2 photolysis and toc degradation only 10 of toc removed the presence of nom greatly inhibited 1 4 dioxane removal during uv h2o2 treatment fig 3d the decline in the removal rate constant in the presence of nom by up to 85 was the largest among all water quality parameters tested in this study table 1 the decrease in the removal rate constant in the presence of nom was attributed to a combination of direct absorption of uv irradiance by colored chromophoric organic matter and hydroxyl radical scavenging sarathy and mohseni 2007 the observed uvt in 0 5 1 and 5 mg c l 1 treatments was 0 975 0 961 and 0 760 respectively and the corresponding reduction in uv fluence in the reactor was 7 11 and 53 respectively it can be noted that the photolysis of h2o2 was reduced by 17 59 in the presence of nom fig s1 and hence reducing the production of hydroxyl radicals needed for 1 4 dioxane degradation in the reactor nom can additionally react with oh radicals k ho nom 1 4 4 5 10 8 m 1 s 1 westerhoff et al 1999 2007 and thus a combination of reduced uv fluence and hydroxyl radical production negatively impacted the performance of the uv h2o2 system the reactions that consume oh radicals by nom may involve i adding oh to double bonds ii gaining an electron from an organic substituent and iii removing h atom to generate carbon centered radicals which then react rapidly with oxygen to form organic peroxyl radicals leading to the production of ketones aldehydes organic acids and eventually carbon dioxide sillanpää and matilainen 2015 the rate constants showed an inverse relationship with nom concentration fig 4 although the characteristics of nom may vary spatially and temporally studies suggested that oh radicals can non selectively break down nom regardless of its structure sillanpää and matilainen 2015 westerhoff et al 1999 among all treatments higher concentrations of aldehydes and organic acids were observed in nom treated samples than in non nom treated water fig 4 byproduct production increased by 225 285 and 408 in the treatment of 0 5 mg c l 1 1 mg c l 1 and 5 mg c l 1 respectively implying that nom serves as an important precursor of byproducts during aop treatment the measured aldehydes and organic acids accounted to only 3 29 of the toc by mass in the treated water suggesting that 71 97 of the organic carbon remain to be characterized after uv h2o2 treatment byproducts e g organic acids and aldehydes in the aop effluent are readily bioavailable and hence may boost heterotrophic bacteria growth and form disinfection byproducts dbps in distribution systems if they are not removed toor and mohseni 2007 moreover some byproducts e g aldehydes generated during the uv h2o2 can lead to cytotoxicity and genotoxicity to cells heringa et al 2011 li et al 2018 penders et al 2012 zhang et al 2019a in the presence of complex organic matrices unintended transformation of organic compounds into toxic substances may also occur in reaction with hydroxyl radicals and uv light for example a recent study prasse et al 2018 reported toxic α β unsaturated enedials and oxoenals generated during the oxidation of phenolic compounds by the uv h2o2 process 3 4 effect of ferrous and ferric ions on uv h2o2 treatment although fenton s reaction highly depends on iron speciation and ph the reaction has been shown to occur spontaneously in neutral ph if iron ions are sufficient in the water vermilyea and voelker 2009 a recent study reported that oh formation increased by 25 with iron addition during uv h2o2 treatment ulliman et al 2018 however whether adding iron ions can enhance aop performance to remove 1 4 dioxane has not been investigated and was the motivation for testing the impact of fe ii and fe iii in this study without uv irradiation almost no 1 4 dioxane was removed in fe iii treatment confirming that fenton s reaction driven by fe iii ions was slow and negligible fig 5 a in contrast 10 of 1 4 dioxane was instantaneously degraded in the presence of fe ii without uv irradiation which can be attributable to rapid fe ii induced fenton s reaction notably the decline of 1 4 dioxane occurred only at the beginning of the experiment from the pattern of iron speciation and oxidation reduction potential over time fig 5b all fe ii was oxidized to fe iii rapidly and immediately after the addition of h2o2 explaining why no further fe ii induced fenton s reaction was achieved in the aop system for other fe treatments with uv irradiation and h2o2 1 4 dioxane was eliminated within 10 min fig 5 table 1 in the presence of fe ii or fe iii the removal rates were inhibited by 16 27 compared to di water treatments it is known that dissolved fe iii ions absorb uv light and have a maximum absorption at 240 nm turner and miles 1957 the observed uvt was 0 925 in the fe iii treatment which corresponds to 20 decline in uv fluence in the reactor thus if groundwater contains a high level of dissolved ferric ions it can have a negative impact on the performance of uv h2o2 due to reduced uvt limited fenton s reaction enhanced removal of 1 4 dioxane 10 removal was observed at the beginning of the experiment likely due to the limited fe ii supply in the batch experiments fe ii assisted removal may be more evident in a flow through uv h2o2 system that treats fe ii rich groundwater 3 5 1 4 dioxane removal in contaminated groundwater samples water quality parameters in the three groundwater samples collected in long island ny were similar to one another table s2 the nitrate concentrations were relatively higher 1 mg n l 1 than typical groundwaters in the u s high levels of background 1 4 dioxane were detected in all the groundwater samples collected ranging from 5 7 to 12 9 μg l 1 table s2 the calculated fluence based removal constants are shown in table 1 and ranged from 2 66 x 10 3 to 3 83 x 10 3 mj 1 cm2 the removal of 1 4 dioxane in the presence of natural groundwater matrices was significantly lower 14 40 compared to the control treatment in di water among the three groundwater samples the lowest removal rate constant was found in gw2 which may be attributable to its relatively high toc 0 43 mg c l 1 and nitrate 3 2 mg n l 1 levels moreover no significant difference between spiked and non spiked treatments was observed table s4 suggesting that the previous results obtained from 100 μg l 1 spiking experiments are generally applicable to groundwaters containing low ppb of 1 4 dioxane swaim et al 2008 reported a 1 4 dioxane removal rate constant of 4 6 x 10 4 mj 1 cm2 in groundwater collected from brighton co usa which was about an order of magnitude lower than the groundwater samples treated in this study this may be due to the high toc nitrate and alkalinity in the groundwater tested by swaim et al 2008 leading to higher scavenging of hydroxyl radicals byproduct formation in the groundwater samples is shown in fig s2 in general all organic acids increased over time although formic acid leveled off after 10 min uv fluence 1576 mj cm 2 of system operation the pattern of organic acid formation was very similar across the three groundwater samples but differed from the di water treatment fig 2b implying that natural water matrices could influence degradation formation kinetics more byproducts were found in gw2 which agreed with its relatively high toc concentration table s2 further confirming our observation in nom spiked di water experiments where nom was shown to be a significant source of byproducts during uv h2o2 treatment based on the observations made in the di water experiments a multiple linear regression model to predict uv h2o2 performance to remove 1 4 dioxane was developed using the water quality data as model input among these parameters nom nitrate and alkalinity were taken into consideration ph was excluded from the model as it did not impact uv h2o2 performance within the environmentally relevant ph range of 5 7 the normalized rate constants were plotted as a function of the concentrations of nom nitrate and alkalinity respectively fig s3 the effect from each parameter was assumed to be independent and additive see text s1 for detailed calculation groundwater data obtained in this study gw1 gw2 and gw3 and a data set gw4 acquired from swaim et al 2008 were tested using the model to date very few groundwater data reporting 1 4 dioxane removal by uv h2o2 were available for comparison the results showed that the model was reasonably good paired t test p 0 05 in predicting the rate constants for these samples fig 6 although a greater discrepancy was found in gw4 data it might originate from extrapolation at the high alkalinity 175 mg caco3 l 1 beyond our model and the different h2o2 dose used 5 vs 10 mg l 1 in that latter study 4 conclusions this study provides the first systematic evaluation of uv h2o2 system performance to remove environmentally relevant levels of 1 4 dioxane by evaluating the impact of groundwater constituents most likely to alter the aop process results demonstrated that nitrate and nom are important groundwater parameters that can negatively impact the removal of 1 4 dioxane iron was shown to inhibit the degradation of 1 4 dioxane due to decreased uvt although fenton s reaction assisted removal 10 of 1 4 dioxane was observed initially in the experiment with fe ii spiked water the predictive model developed here after validation with additional water sources and aop performance data can help to predict uv h2o2 performance using site specific groundwater quality data in other contaminated sites this study showed increased production of byproducts aldehydes and organic acids from aop treatment which will require additional treatment steps such as granular activated carbon gac and or biologically active carbon bac filters nom was shown to be an important and significant contributor to byproducts generation during uv h2o2 treatment the standardized data provided in this study specifically fluence based removal rate constant and eeo will assist in the design and evaluation of pilot and full

18089,in this study a semi batch bench scale uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 advanced oxidation process system was used to investigate how typical groundwater quality parameters ph alkalinity natural organic matter nom nitrate and iron influence the treatment of 1 4 dioxane deionized di water spiked with 1 4 dioxane 100 μg l 1 treated using h2o2 10 mg l 1 in a commercially available uv system 40 w low pressure lamp showed an uv fluence based first order rate constant k and electrical energy per order eeo of 4 32 10 3 cm2 mj 1 and 0 15 kwh m 3 order 1 respectively the most abundant byproduct generated in spiked di water was oxalic acid up to 55 μg l 1 followed by formic and acetic acids the k showed no significant difference at ph ranging from 5 to 7 and at low alkalinity concentrations 20 mg caco3 l 1 typical of sandy aquifers the k declined by up to 85 with increasing nom concentration elevated production up to 400 increase of aldehydes and organic acids was observed in nom spiked water implying that nom is a significant byproduct precursor during uv h2o2 treatment high no3 concentration 10 mg n l 1 in source water reduced the k by 25 while no significant impact was observed at lower concentrations 2 mg n l 1 addition of fe ii at 0 5 mg l 1 resulted in an instantaneous fenton reaction assisted removal of 10 1 4 dioxane in the presence of h2o2 but did not enhance the performance of uv h2o2 treatment over time in contrast both fe ii and fe iii addition lowered the k by 15 27 the decline of k observed in these experiments was attributed to reduced uvt fe oh radical scavenging ph or both no3 nom treatment of groundwater samples collected from three 1 4 dioxane contaminated wells located in long island ny showed k values of 13 40 lower than what was observed for di water due to radical scavenging from a combination of high no3 and nom in the samples a multiple linear regression model developed using water quality data as model input showed good agreement with field observations paired t test p 0 05 in predicting k for the removal of 1 4 dioxane from groundwater this study provides the first systematic evaluation of the impacts of groundwater quality on uv h2o2 process to remove environmentally relevant levels of 1 4 dioxane and reports standardized performance related parameters to aid in the design and evaluation of full scale systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation processes uv hydrogen peroxide treatment 1 4 dioxane groundwater treatment byproducts 1 introduction 1 4 dioxane c4h8o2 is a widely used solvent for a variety of industrial applications such as in the manufacture of chlorinated solvents e g 1 1 1 trichloroethane in products like adhesives sealants paint strippers dyes greases varnishes waxes and in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals zenker et al 2003 in addition to its intentional uses 1 4 dioxane is also found as an impurity in consumer products such as deodorants shampoos and cosmetics and as a byproduct during the manufacture of polyethylene terephthalate pet plastic mohr et al 2010 zenker et al 2003 1 4 dioxane is classified as a probable human carcinogen based on evidence of carcinogenicity from animal studies showing increased incidences of nasal cavity liver and gallbladder tumors following oral exposure atsdr 2012 wastewater discharge unintended spills and historical disposal practices have led to the widespread contamination of 1 4 dioxane in drinking water sources across the u s analysis of the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule 3 ucmr3 data from the u s epa revealed that 1 4 dioxane was detectable at over 4000 sites across the u s adamson et al 2017 and more than 600 sites were above the health based drinking water reference level established by the u s epa 0 35 μg l 1 representing one in a million cancer risk u s epa 2013 in new york state nys alone 516 sites were found above the detection limit 0 07 μg l 1 with 238 sites showing 1 4 dioxane concentrations higher than 0 35 μg l 1 as per ucmr3 data currently there is no established federal maximum contaminant level mcl for 1 4 dioxane in drinking water but several states have their own clean up or notification levels ranging from 0 3 to 70 μg l 1 recently the nys department of health has approved the nation s first 1 4 dioxane standard at 1 μg l 1 parts per billion ppb in drinking water nys government 2019 1 4 dioxane is highly persistent soluble in water resistant to bio degradation non volatile and has a low sorption coefficient making it extremely difficult to remove from water using conventional water treatment processes e g by activated carbon air stripping etc zenker et al 2003 advanced oxidation processes aops are very effective at oxidizing 1 4 dioxane in drinking waters among various aops ultra violet uv based aop including uv h2o2 antoniou and andersen 2015 coleman et al 2007 kim et al 2006 martijn et al 2010 maurino et al 1997 stefan and bolton 1998 uv s2o8

vis ferrioxalate h2o2 safarzadeh amiri et al 1997 and the photoelectro peroxone pep process shen et al 2017 have been extensively studied a few studies have examined the generation of intermediates e g aldehydes organic acids and the mono and diformate esters of ethylene glycol during uv h2o2 treatment of 1 4 dioxane and have proposed possible degradation pathways maurino et al 1997 stefan and bolton 1998 li et al 2018 further investigated the cyto and geno toxicity of known intermediates from 1 4 dioxane degradation during uv based aop treatment uv h2o2 uv s2o8 2 and uv nh2cl and suggested that formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde were the most cyto and geno toxic byproducts although several studies have shown a good efficacy of decomposing 1 4 dioxane through uv based aops summarized in table s1 scaling up or comparing these studies has been a challenge because of i varying experimental conditions ii a lack of standardized reporting of system performance e g electrical energy per order eeo and or uv dose was often not reported and iii a lack of testing performed under environmentally relevant conditions e g high concentrations of 1 4 dioxane at parts per million levels were often tested although one study was performed at environmentally relevant levels of 1 4 dioxane swaim et al 2008 the impact of water quality was not evaluated in the study it is well known that some naturally occurring compounds in groundwater can scavenge radicals that may significantly impact the performance of aops crittenden et al 2012 and thus there is a need to evaluate source water quality impacts on the efficacy of aop treatment of 1 4 dioxane in this study a series of experiments at environmentally relevant conditions were performed to i comprehensively investigate the impact of ph alkalinity nitrate natural organic matter nom and iron on 1 4 dioxane removal ii assess the formation of associated byproducts and iii report variation in performance related parameters eeo and uv fluence based rate constants during bench scale uv h2o2 treatment to the best of our knowledge the impact of fe ferrous and ferric ions alkalinity and nom on uv h2o2 treatment of 1 4 dioxane has not been reported in literature organic acids formic acetic and oxalic acids and aldehydes formaldehyde acetaldehyde and glyoxal were monitored which are known major byproducts formed during aop treatment of 1 4 dioxane stefan and bolton 1998 these compounds are also common byproducts generated during aop treatment of organic compounds e g phenolic compounds alnaizy and akgerman 2000 scheck and frimmel 1995 and hence additionally serve as representative byproducts to assess the relative levels generated from other organics e g nom in groundwater the results from experiments with synthetic source water were further compared with groundwater samples collected from sites contaminated with 1 4 dioxane 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents and aop system settings all chemicals and solvents used in this study were of either certified acs reagent grade or analytical grade with high purity and were purchased from sigma aldrich or fisher scientific deionized water di water elix and ultra pure milli q water 18 2 mω cm were used throughout experiments a schematic diagram of the bench scale aop system is shown in fig 1 the uv reactor was equipped with a low pressure mercury lamp 40 w λ 253 7 nm and purchased from viqua ontario canada the system was operated in a semi batch mode and the flow rate was fixed at 45 l min 1 the volume of the uv reactor was 2 6 l and the contact time was 3 5 s the water reservoir 20 l was cooled in an ice cold water bath to maintain a temperature at 23 3 c during operation the temperature ph and oxidation reduction potential orp in treated water were monitored simultaneously over time using a hach loveland colorado sension mm150 portable meter treated water samples were collected through a sampling port at each time point for subsequent analyses two well established methods atrazine actinometry and the pcba para chlorobenzoic acid method rosenfeldt et al 2006 were used to determine the uv dose rate uv fluence rate and the steady state hydroxyl radical production in the system respectively the calculated average uv fluence rate was 2 63 mw cm 2 and the calculated steady state concentration of hydroxyl radicals oh was 2 x 10 12 m 2 2 experimental design in each experiment 20 l of di water spiked with 100 μg l 1 of 1 4 dioxane and 10 mg l 1 of h2o2 was prepared to evaluate the kinetics of 1 4 dioxane removal and byproducts formation over time the majority of previous studies used higher concentrations of 1 4 dioxane ppm levels during aop treatment table s1 typically observed in heavily contaminated sites e g superfund sites with concentrations as high as 105 μg l 1 adamson et al 2015 anderson et al 2012 but providing less relevance to contaminated drinking water systems that have low parts per billion levels of 1 4 dioxane range detected in drinking water 0 07 34 μg l 1 from ucmr3 data hence an initial 1 4 dioxane concentration of 100 μg l 1 was chosen in this study for its environmental relevance and to facilitate the detection of intermediates byproducts generated during aop treatment the h2o2 dose was selected to match the dose currently being employed in a full scale aop system operated in long island ny aliquots of treated water samples were obtained and analyzed for uv transmittance at 254 nm uvt h2o2 1 4 dioxane aldehydes and organic acids because excess h2o2 in samples may damage analytical instruments 1 mg l 1 of catalase was added to samples to quench h2o2 before all subsequent chemical analyses except h2o2 determination catalase did not introduce any background contamination of target byproducts in control experiments experiments evaluating the impact of various groundwater parameters ph alkalinity nom nitrate and iron were also conducted in di water sulfuric acid 1 n and sodium

experiments addition of iron species fe2 feso4 and fe3 fecl3 in di water 0 5 mg fe l 1 each was tested separately to assess the possibility of fenton type reactions during uv h2o2 treatment the concentrations of the water quality parameters described above were based on the typical groundwater levels found in sand and gravel aquifers like on long island ny and on the u s epa s secondary drinking water standards i e for fe is 0 3 mg l 1 in addition to the experiments with synthetic source water as described above 1 4 dioxane contaminated groundwater samples from three locations gw1 gw2 and gw3 on long island ny were collected to evaluate aop performance and the impact of the groundwater matrix on the removal of 1 4 dioxane the water quality parameters for the field samples are listed in table s2 each groundwater sample had two treatments one was with only native 1 4 dioxane levels range 5 7 12 9 μg l 1 and the other was spiked with additional 1 4 dioxane at 100 μg l 1 2 3

in addition tetrahydrofuran d 8 thf d 8 was added as an internal standard is to monitor the instrumental stability during analysis a frozen micro extraction fme method li et al 2011 was employed to extract 1 4 dioxane from treated water fme method is a modified liquid liquid extraction technique briefly an 800 μl aliquot of the sample was transferred to a 2 ml centrifuge tube and spiked with is and sur an equal volume 800 μl of dichloromethane was added into the tube the tube was capped firmly shaken for 60 s and was frozen at 80 c for 30 min the top frozen aqueous phase layer was discarded and the bottom organic phase was collected for subsequent analysis by gc ms the average calculated recovery of sur using the fme method was 90 6 n 205 throughout the experiments aldehydes formaldehyde acetaldehyde and glyoxal were analyzed following the modified epa method 8315a in brief samples were buffered and reacted with 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine dnph to form dnph aldehyde derivatives the

a significant level p set at 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 1 4 dioxane breakdown and byproducts formation during uv h2o2 treatment as expected direct uv photolysis of 1 4 dioxane was not observed and h2o2 alone did not degrade 1 4 dioxane fig 2 a in the presence of h2o2 10 mg l 1 along with uv irradiation 1 4 dioxane was rapidly decomposed by 90 in the first 3 5 min uv fluence 550 mj cm 2 and became undetectable after 8 min uv fluence 1260 mj cm 2 of operation fig 2a the calculated first order rate constant was k 1 13 0 13 10 2 s 1 based on the uv fluence rate evaluated in our system the calculated fluence based rate constant k was 4 41 10 3 mj 1 cm2 and the estimated eeo was 0 13 kwh order 1 m 3 table 1 these values were comparable to and in some cases better than previous studies indicating that the bench scale uv h2o2 system was effective in degrading 1 4 dioxane at environmentally relevant parts per billion levels in water for comparison table s1 summarizes previous studies which employed uv h2o2 treatment to remove 1 4 dioxane and reported available data of rate constants 0 03 1 13 10 2 s 1 and 0 46 4 41 10 3 mj 1 cm2 and eeo 0 13 7 4 kwh order 1 m 3 after 30 min of operation 40 of h2o2 was consumed and the corresponding first order rate constant and fluence based rate constants for h2o2 photolysis were 3 0 10 4 s 1 and 1 1 10 4 mj 1 cm2 respectively known byproducts aldehydes and organic acids were detected in treated water samples fig 2b and c acetaldehyde and glyoxal increased over time to a maximum of 5 μg l 1 and 11 μg l 1 respectively at 8 min uv fluence 1260 mj cm 2 but eventually decreased with continued treatment the formation of organic acids was observed after the aldehydes and coincided with the timing at which the ph declined this sequence of byproduct formation was similar to observations reported in a previous study stefan and bolton 1998 by calculating a carbon mass balance over the 30 min experimental time course aldehydes and organic acids accounted for up to 68 of carbon mass derived from 1 4 dioxane at 20 min fig 2d the deficit in carbon mass balance was expected since previous studies have shown the formation of other intermediates like 1 2 ethanediol monoformate 1 2 ethanediol diformate methoxyacetic and glycolic acids not analyzed in this study can account for up to 40 mass of generated byproducts at the early stages of 1 4 dioxane degradation maurino et al 1997 stefan and bolton 1998 the mineralization of simple organic acids to co2 can further explain the deficit in the carbon mass balance at the later stages of aop treatment in a full scale system the typical residence time of water during uv h2o2 treatment is 10 s unpublished information provided by water treatment facility and hence complete mineralization of these byproducts is very unlikely 3 2 effect of ph alkalinity and nitrate the results for 1 4 dioxane removal at different ph alkalinity and nitrate levels are shown in fig 3 and the calculated removal rate constants are presented in table 1 results showed that the removal rate constants did not differ significantly from ph 5 to ph 7 table s4 however the rate constant declined by 40 at ph 8 previous studies have shown a range in the optimal ph for the degradation of various contaminants by uv h2o2 the optimal ph range of 4 10 for phenol alnaizy and akgerman 2000 3 5 5 5 for acid blue 74 dye aleboyeh et al 2005 3 6 for dimethyl phthalate tawabini and al suwaiyan 2004 xu et al 2009 6 8 8 1 for microcystin rr qiao et al 2005 5 8 for n butylparaben and 4 tert octylphenol błędzka et al 2010 10 for chlorpyrifos de oliveira et al 2014 5 9 for roxarsone adak et al 2015 and 3 9 for sulfaquinoxaline sodium liao et al 2016 a recent study showed no significant difference between ph 5 7 and ph 7 0 on 1 4 dioxane removal by uv h2o2 for potable reuse zhang et al 2019b noting that 3 mg l 1 of chloramines were added in the water prior to the treatment the drop in degradation rate constant observed at ph 8 in this study is likely because h2o2 molecules dissociate and form its conjugate base ho2 under alkaline conditions these ho2 anions can further react with non dissociated h2o2 lowering the amount of h2o2 in water which is the primary source of oh furthermore ho2 can also consume oh rapidly rate constant 7 5 x 109 m 1 s 1 christensen et al 1982 to generate superoxide radicals o2 which have less reactivity with organic pollutants bielski et al 1985 additionally the self decomposition rate of h2o2 increases strongly with increasing ph which can result in direct formation of h2o and o2 without involving uv photolysis chu 2001 the addition of alkalinity 5 20 mg caco3 l 1 had no significant impact on 1 4 dioxane removal fig 3b and table 1 there are two likely reasons to explain this observation firstly this result may be due to the low concentrations of alkalinity mainly carbonate species used in this study to mimic typical groundwater alkalinity levels in sandy aquifers however higher amounts of carbonate 100 mg caco3 l 1 have been reported to moderately decrease the degradation of organic contaminants such as sulfaquinoxaline sodium liao et al 2016 and roxarsone nitarsone adak et al 2015 by uv h2o2 in a uv tio2 study the breakdown of 1 4 dioxane was inhibited in the presence of high bicarbonate ions nahco3 214 mg l 1 mehrvar et al 2001 secondly carbonate speciation in solution is critical to oh scavenging at high ph 11 co3 2 is the dominant species which has a higher reaction rate constant with oh k ho co 3 2 3 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 at near neutral ph this study hco3 is the dominant carbonate species and has a much lower reaction rate constant with oh k ho hco 3 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 although carbonate radicals co3 would be produced during oh radical scavenging they show more selectivity and less reactivity toward organic pollutants than oh radicals mazellier et al 2007 mehrvar et al 2001 low concentrations of nitrate 1 and 2 mg n l 1 showed negligible effects on 1 4 dioxane removal efficiency but high nitrate concentration 10 mg n l 1 decreased the removal rate constant by 25 fig 3c table 1 martijn et al 2010 confirmed oh radical scavenging in the presence of nitrate using pcba as a probe compound to partially explain the difference in 1 4 dioxane removal by uv h2o2 compared to coagulation sedimentation filtration csf and ion exchange ultrafiltration ix uf treated waters several studies also reported inhibition in the degradation of diverse organic pollutants by uv h2o2 in the presence of nitrate błędzka et al 2010 liao et al 2016 park et al 2014 this observation can likely be attributable to the combination of direct uv absorption by nitrate and the consumption of oh radicals by nitrite ions produced from direct uv photolysis of nitrate mack and bolton 1999 the uvt was reduced to 0 944 at 10 mg n l 1 corresponding to 15 decline of uv fluence received by the treated water which explains the scavenging effect of high nitrates in water nitrate inhibited degradation is expected to be more pronounced if medium pressure hg lamps are used because higher uv absorbance of nitrate can occur at 300 nm compared to the wavelength of 254 nm used in this study mack and bolton 1999 3 3 effect of nom on uv h2o2 performance the change in ph toc uvt at 254 nm and h2o2 with time for each nom treatment is shown in fig s1 a decrease in ph was observed in all experiments consistent with the observed formation of organic acids fig s1 in the low nom treatments 0 5 and 1 mg c l 1 toc decreased by 50 after 30 min uv fluence 4728 mj cm 2 indicating the effective degradation of organic matter by uv photolysis and oh with higher addition of nom 5 mg c l 1 uvt declined greatly to 0 8 subsequently reducing h2o2 photolysis and toc degradation only 10 of toc removed the presence of nom greatly inhibited 1 4 dioxane removal during uv h2o2 treatment fig 3d the decline in the removal rate constant in the presence of nom by up to 85 was the largest among all water quality parameters tested in this study table 1 the decrease in the removal rate constant in the presence of nom was attributed to a combination of direct absorption of uv irradiance by colored chromophoric organic matter and hydroxyl radical scavenging sarathy and mohseni 2007 the observed uvt in 0 5 1 and 5 mg c l 1 treatments was 0 975 0 961 and 0 760 respectively and the corresponding reduction in uv fluence in the reactor was 7 11 and 53 respectively it can be noted that the photolysis of h2o2 was reduced by 17 59 in the presence of nom fig s1 and hence reducing the production of hydroxyl radicals needed for 1 4 dioxane degradation in the reactor nom can additionally react with oh radicals k ho nom 1 4 4 5 10 8 m 1 s 1 westerhoff et al 1999 2007 and thus a combination of reduced uv fluence and hydroxyl radical production negatively impacted the performance of the uv h2o2 system the reactions that consume oh radicals by nom may involve i adding oh to double bonds ii gaining an electron from an organic substituent and iii removing h atom to generate carbon centered radicals which then react rapidly with oxygen to form organic peroxyl radicals leading to the production of ketones aldehydes organic acids and eventually carbon dioxide sillanpää and matilainen 2015 the rate constants showed an inverse relationship with nom concentration fig 4 although the characteristics of nom may vary spatially and temporally studies suggested that oh radicals can non selectively break down nom regardless of its structure sillanpää and matilainen 2015 westerhoff et al 1999 among all treatments higher concentrations of aldehydes and organic acids were observed in nom treated samples than in non nom treated water fig 4 byproduct production increased by 225 285 and 408 in the treatment of 0 5 mg c l 1 1 mg c l 1 and 5 mg c l 1 respectively implying that nom serves as an important precursor of byproducts during aop treatment the measured aldehydes and organic acids accounted to only 3 29 of the toc by mass in the treated water suggesting that 71 97 of the organic carbon remain to be characterized after uv h2o2 treatment byproducts e g organic acids and aldehydes in the aop effluent are readily bioavailable and hence may boost heterotrophic bacteria growth and form disinfection byproducts dbps in distribution systems if they are not removed toor and mohseni 2007 moreover some byproducts e g aldehydes generated during the uv h2o2 can lead to cytotoxicity and genotoxicity to cells heringa et al 2011 li et al 2018 penders et al 2012 zhang et al 2019a in the presence of complex organic matrices unintended transformation of organic compounds into toxic substances may also occur in reaction with hydroxyl radicals and uv light for example a recent study prasse et al 2018 reported toxic α β unsaturated enedials and oxoenals generated during the oxidation of phenolic compounds by the uv h2o2 process 3 4 effect of ferrous and ferric ions on uv h2o2 treatment although fenton s reaction highly depends on iron speciation and ph the reaction has been shown to occur spontaneously in neutral ph if iron ions are sufficient in the water vermilyea and voelker 2009 a recent study reported that oh formation increased by 25 with iron addition during uv h2o2 treatment ulliman et al 2018 however whether adding iron ions can enhance aop performance to remove 1 4 dioxane has not been investigated and was the motivation for testing the impact of fe ii and fe iii in this study without uv irradiation almost no 1 4 dioxane was removed in fe iii treatment confirming that fenton s reaction driven by fe iii ions was slow and negligible fig 5 a in contrast 10 of 1 4 dioxane was instantaneously degraded in the presence of fe ii without uv irradiation which can be attributable to rapid fe ii induced fenton s reaction notably the decline of 1 4 dioxane occurred only at the beginning of the experiment from the pattern of iron speciation and oxidation reduction potential over time fig 5b all fe ii was oxidized to fe iii rapidly and immediately after the addition of h2o2 explaining why no further fe ii induced fenton s reaction was achieved in the aop system for other fe treatments with uv irradiation and h2o2 1 4 dioxane was eliminated within 10 min fig 5 table 1 in the presence of fe ii or fe iii the removal rates were inhibited by 16 27 compared to di water treatments it is known that dissolved fe iii ions absorb uv light and have a maximum absorption at 240 nm turner and miles 1957 the observed uvt was 0 925 in the fe iii treatment which corresponds to 20 decline in uv fluence in the reactor thus if groundwater contains a high level of dissolved ferric ions it can have a negative impact on the performance of uv h2o2 due to reduced uvt limited fenton s reaction enhanced removal of 1 4 dioxane 10 removal was observed at the beginning of the experiment likely due to the limited fe ii supply in the batch experiments fe ii assisted removal may be more evident in a flow through uv h2o2 system that treats fe ii rich groundwater 3 5 1 4 dioxane removal in contaminated groundwater samples water quality parameters in the three groundwater samples collected in long island ny were similar to one another table s2 the nitrate concentrations were relatively higher 1 mg n l 1 than typical groundwaters in the u s high levels of background 1 4 dioxane were detected in all the groundwater samples collected ranging from 5 7 to 12 9 μg l 1 table s2 the calculated fluence based removal constants are shown in table 1 and ranged from 2 66 x 10 3 to 3 83 x 10 3 mj 1 cm2 the removal of 1 4 dioxane in the presence of natural groundwater matrices was significantly lower 14 40 compared to the control treatment in di water among the three groundwater samples the lowest removal rate constant was found in gw2 which may be attributable to its relatively high toc 0 43 mg c l 1 and nitrate 3 2 mg n l 1 levels moreover no significant difference between spiked and non spiked treatments was observed table s4 suggesting that the previous results obtained from 100 μg l 1 spiking experiments are generally applicable to groundwaters containing low ppb of 1 4 dioxane swaim et al 2008 reported a 1 4 dioxane removal rate constant of 4 6 x 10 4 mj 1 cm2 in groundwater collected from brighton co usa which was about an order of magnitude lower than the groundwater samples treated in this study this may be due to the high toc nitrate and alkalinity in the groundwater tested by swaim et al 2008 leading to higher scavenging of hydroxyl radicals byproduct formation in the groundwater samples is shown in fig s2 in general all organic acids increased over time although formic acid leveled off after 10 min uv fluence 1576 mj cm 2 of system operation the pattern of organic acid formation was very similar across the three groundwater samples but differed from the di water treatment fig 2b implying that natural water matrices could influence degradation formation kinetics more byproducts were found in gw2 which agreed with its relatively high toc concentration table s2 further confirming our observation in nom spiked di water experiments where nom was shown to be a significant source of byproducts during uv h2o2 treatment based on the observations made in the di water experiments a multiple linear regression model to predict uv h2o2 performance to remove 1 4 dioxane was developed using the water quality data as model input among these parameters nom nitrate and alkalinity were taken into consideration ph was excluded from the model as it did not impact uv h2o2 performance within the environmentally relevant ph range of 5 7 the normalized rate constants were plotted as a function of the concentrations of nom nitrate and alkalinity respectively fig s3 the effect from each parameter was assumed to be independent and additive see text s1 for detailed calculation groundwater data obtained in this study gw1 gw2 and gw3 and a data set gw4 acquired from swaim et al 2008 were tested using the model to date very few groundwater data reporting 1 4 dioxane removal by uv h2o2 were available for comparison the results showed that the model was reasonably good paired t test p 0 05 in predicting the rate constants for these samples fig 6 although a greater discrepancy was found in gw4 data it might originate from extrapolation at the high alkalinity 175 mg caco3 l 1 beyond our model and the different h2o2 dose used 5 vs 10 mg l 1 in that latter study 4 conclusions this study provides the first systematic evaluation of uv h2o2 system performance to remove environmentally relevant levels of 1 4 dioxane by evaluating the impact of groundwater constituents most likely to alter the aop process results demonstrated that nitrate and nom are important groundwater parameters that can negatively impact the removal of 1 4 dioxane iron was shown to inhibit the degradation of 1 4 dioxane due to decreased uvt although fenton s reaction assisted removal 10 of 1 4 dioxane was observed initially in the experiment with fe ii spiked water the predictive model developed here after validation with additional water sources and aop performance data can help to predict uv h2o2 performance using site specific groundwater quality data in other contaminated sites this study showed increased production of byproducts aldehydes and organic acids from aop treatment which will require additional treatment steps such as granular activated carbon gac and or biologically active carbon bac filters nom was shown to be an important and significant contributor to byproducts generation during uv h2o2 treatment the standardized data provided in this study specifically fluence based removal rate constant and eeo will assist in the design and evaluation of pilot and full
