14140,several efforts have been conducted to reach an efficient and safe process for degradation of organic pollutants in water environments percarbonate pc or solid hydrogen peroxide has gained great attention as an alternative for hydrogen peroxide in advanced oxidation processes in current work sono photo activation method was used to pc activation for degradation of acid orange 7 ao7 ultrasound us and ultraviolet light emitted diode uvc leds were prosperous in the generation of free radicals in presence of pc under optimum conditions ph 6 0 pc 1 5 mm 100 w us power and 90 reaction time 93 of ao7 was eliminated while its rate constant was 0 0315 min 1 there was a promotional effect for chloride and nitrate ions at high concentration in pc us uvc leds process nitrate ions photolysis and sonolysis could degrade ao7 indicating that hydroxyl radical are generated in absent of pc a major role for hydroxyl radical and minor role for superoxide radical were determined by trapping experiments pc us uvc leds was also applied for an actual matrix which was not successful as well as synthetic solution by products of ao7 degradation was identified and proposed reaction was illustrated this article conclusively states that pc us uvc leds can be a new method for the degradation of organic pollutants in water keywords percarbonate organic dye uvc leds ultrasound advanced oxidation processes 1 introduction numerous studies have been focused on dye degradation and treatment of colored wastewater in the past half century dyes are organic pollutants which are determined by absorbing the visible region 400 700 nm of the electromagnetic spectrum among various groups of dyes azo dyes nitrogen to nitrogen double bonds are of high importance because of large volume of their production 50 of all dyes produced are in class of azo dyes 1 2 they have been used in different industries and manufactures such as textile industry cosmetic manufacture food and pharmaceutical sector there are several environmental concerns about azo dyes in water including coloring water resource toxicity for aquatic microorganism and the presence of their degradation by products which may be more toxic than mother molecule 3 4 recently environmental engineers have endeavored to find an effective solution for the degradation of azo dye in contaminated water and treatment of colored wastewater in order to complete decolorization and high mineralization degree advanced oxidation processes aops have been suggested by water and wastewater experts 5 aops produce reactive oxygen species ros especially hydroxyl radicals ho e0 2 8 v to destruct organic bond of dyes thanks to high oxidation potential and non selectivity in chemical reaction 6 7 to produce hydroxyl radicals several methods have been examined including fenton oxidation photocatalysis ozonation radiolysis sonoloysis and electrolysis processes 8 the use of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 has been proposed for the generation of hydroxyl radicals in which transition metals ultraviolet uv and ultrasound us irradiations are known as the activators of h2o2 for ho generation 9 10 although transition metals have proved the high performance in catalyzing h2o2 their residuals and recovery are so difficult 11 recent studies have exhibited high function of uv and us irradiation in activation of chemical oxidants in water and wastewater treatment uv and us can activate hydrogen peroxide and produce hydroxyl radicals based on following equation 12 13 1 h 2 o 2 us or uv ho ho in recent years other chemical oxidants have been applied instead of hydrogen peroxide persulfate and peroxymonosulfate anions have attained abundant regard owning to high potential of sulfate radicals however sulfate ions as by product are the most important of limitation in their application 14 15 although hydrogen peroxide is an inexpensive and powerful oxidant for water and wastewater treatment its application is always a serious challenge in large scale the use storage and transportation of concentrated hydrogen peroxide is difficult in terms of safety and stability the rate of h2o2 decomposition increases approximately 2 2 times for each 10 rise in temperature in the range from 20 to 100 in addition reactivity and corrosivity of h2o2 is a big problem for facilities and instruments 16 sodium percarbonate 2na2co3 3h2o2 has been known as an oxidative agent for synthesis of various organic compounds sodium percarbonate can be an alternative for h2o2 in aops indeed percarbonate pc is solid hydrogen peroxide in which it releases hydrogen peroxide when it is dissolved in water pc can be easily stored and handled that it can compensate its higher material cost compared to hydrogen peroxide price of pc is three time more than that of h2o2 17 20 moreover the presence of carbonate ion in structure of pc prevents the acidification of water resources especially groundwater sodium carbonate is a safe and neutral by product which is present in water resources pc can act in wide range of ph which is a superiority compared to fenton oxidation recently pc has been widely used for degradation of organic pollutants in presence of transition metal like fenton oxidation 21 22 the sono activation and photo activation methods perform often under mild conditions with simple instruments and easy operation 23 moreover pc uv also showed high efficiency for degradation of pharmaceutical compounds 17 high energy input can extremely activate pc for the production of free radicals however no study has been investigated on us pc for degradation of organic pollutant in aqueous solution uvc light emitting diodes led has not been studied for pc activation yet besides simultaneous usages of us and uvc leds for pc activation is first study in environmental application of pc for degradation of organic dyes in this study us uvc leds activated pc process was used to degrade a sample of organic dye acid orange 7 for the first time the operational parameters were evaluated on ao7 removal with focus on ph pc dosage reaction time and determination of reaction rate constant the effects of some anions were studied on ao7 removal various iron based heterogeneous catalyst were applied as a promotor and their results were also reported the performance of pc us uvc leds was tested for an actual wastewater treatment mineralization and by products were also determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals acid orang 7 c16h11n2nao4s was purchased from alvan sabet inc with purity more than 98 sodium percarbonate 2na2co3 3h2o2 99 and 4 5 dihydroxy 1 3 benzenedisulfonic acid disodium salt c6h4na2o8s2 were provided from sigma aldrich company nanoparticles of fe3o4 20 30 nm and α fe2o3 20 40

sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o 98 and tert butyl alcohol c4h10o were purchased from samchun inc 2 2 set up of pc us uv c leds a cylindrical quartz was used as reactor with dimension of 6 cm diameter 16 cm height 300 ml of 25 mg l ao7 solution was added into the reactor in order to adjust solution ph sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide were utilized with precision of 0 02 for ph value a q125 ultrasonic generator 100 200 300 w 20 khz equipped with an ultrasonic probe was selected for sonication of dye solution to irradiate uvc light 6 uvc leds 1 w 258 262 nm were applied for this purpose 3 leds at the left side of reactor and 3 leds at the right of the reactor were set up to make a balance of irradiation for dye solution there was a 50 mm distance between reactor and uvc leds an electronic chip was exerted to install all uvc leds which was operated by a dc power 2000 ma 30 0 v the uvc intensity in center of the rector was 2 55 2 71 mw cm2 pc in different dosages 0 5 2 mm was added to the dye solution while mixing was conducted a magnetic stirrer sonication instrument and uvc leds were simultaneously turn on to start photo sono activation of pc to degrade ao7 the mixing was conducted by a small mechanical stirrer when fe3o4 and zvi were used at regular time intervals sampling was conducted and the remaining ao7 was immediately analyzed for measurement of toc sodium nitrite was used a strong quencher all experiments were carried out in triplicate and average value was used in the results standard deviation was less than 2 9 for all experiments the scheme of pc us uvc leds process is presented in fig 1 2 3 analytical method ao7 absorbancy was determined by a spectrophotometer elmer perkin at the wavelength of 485 nm as the wavelength of maximum absorbance of ao7 toc values were determined by toc analyzer shimadzo japan h2o2 was measured by iodometric titration method admi american dye manufacturers institute method was used for color measurement in actual wastewater using a spectrophotometer hach dr5000 chemical oxygen demand cod and 5 days biochemical oxygen demand bod5 were determined according to standard methods 24 total dissolved solids tds iron concentration and chloride ions were measured by gravimetric phenanthroline spectrophotometric and argentometric method respectively to identify degradation by products the sample was analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy lc ms water 2695 milford ma a capillary column c 18 5μm 50 mm length was used for separation of product intermediates the mobile phase was a mixture of water and acetonitrile 50 50 v v which was adjusted by 10 mm ammonium acetate and 0 05 acetic acid the flow rate of elute was 0 5 ml min 1 and 20 μl of the sample was injected to the instrument actual dyeing wastewater was collected from semnan province in iran in which it consisting of dyeing mercerization and washing effluents 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of ph pc dosage and us power the solution ph is a critical factor in aops for the degradation of organic compounds the effect of solution ph was investigated in range of 3 0 9 0 fig 2 a indicates ao7 removal in various ph values in fixed conditions of 1 mm pc and 100 w us power within 90 min reaction time as can be see the decolorization was in range of 65 85 for all ph values expect for ph 9 0 the most efficiency was observed in ph 6 0 with 85 decolorization theoretically in ph values of 4 5 8 3 bicarbonate ions are predominant in the solutions in which pc is hydrolyzed based on eq 2 according to carbonate equilibrium carbonate co3 2 species is dominated at alkaline conditions it may be possible formation of carbonate radical co3 which is a low active radical with redox potential e0 of 1 63 v at ph 8 4 and 1 59 at ph 12 25 on the other hand bicarbonate ions react directly with hydrogen peroxide to produce peroxymonocarbonate ion hco4 eq 3 17 after that photolysis and sonolysis of hco4 results in the formation of hydroxyl radicals and carbonate radicals eq 4 besides the redox potential of hydroxyl radical depends on the ph value in which with increase of ph declines its redox potential e0 1 9 v at ph 7 0 and e0 2 65 2 8 at ph 3 0 26 hence ph can govern the performance of pc us uvc leds process in aqueous solution in fact ph value is an influential factor in carbonate species and power of hydroxyl radical the lowest efficiency in decolorization was attributed to ph 9 0 with 52 regarding above description at ph higher than 8 3 dye removal is under influence of reduction of hydroxyl radical power and carbonate species 2 2nac o 3 3h 2 o 2 h 2 o 3h 2 o 2 2hc o 3 2n a 1 2 o 2 3 hco 3 h 2 o 2 hco 4 h 2 o 4 hco 4 uv or us ho co 3 fig 2b shows changes of solution ph during 90 min reaction time under the conditions of 1 mm pc and 100 w us power within 90 min reaction time it has been reported that hydrogen peroxide usually reduces solution ph while carbonate ions increase of ph value as shown in this figure ph values were increased slightly during 90 min reaction in all conditions the increase of ph was less than 1 unit indicating that the changes of ph are insignificant in pc us uvc leds process indeed interaction of hydrogen peroxide and carbonate ions induces a slight change in solution ph accordingly ph 6 0 had the highest dye removal efficiency and ph of solution is raised to 6 77 after 90 min reaction time this output can be considerable for next treatment process if pc us uvc leds process was operated as pretreatment in integrated processes in which biological process is performed as post treatment in other words ph 6 77 is favorable for biological process in which microorganisms activity is conducted in range of 6 0 8 0 27 the effect of pc dosage on ao7 removal was examined under conditions of ph 6 0 and 100 w us power fig 2c shows ao7 removal in different pc dosages in literature it has been mostly reported that the increase in oxidant dosage enhances degradation process as shown increase in pc dosage boosted the decolorization when pc dosage was increased from 0 5 mm to 1 5 mm in this way ao7 removals in 90 min were 70 1 85 0 93 7 and 80 2 for 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 mm respectively a decrease was obtained in 2 mm pc dosage this phenomenon can be related to classical scavenging of hydroxyl radials via higher dosage of oxidants which has been broadly reported in literature 28 29 in fact higher dosage of oxidant h2o2 or pc may scavenge hydroxyl radical to produce hydroperoxyl radicals ho2 with weaker reactivity for the degradation of organic contaminants eq 5 30 moreover the recombination of free radicals can be also a hypothesis for decrease of removal efficiency based on eqs 6 8 31 32 5 ho h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o 6 ho 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 7 ho ho h 2 o 2 8 ho 2 ho o 2 h 2 o the effect of us power was studied under optimized previous steps in which three levels of us power were investigated at ph 6 0 and 1 5 mm pc dosage fig 2d presents ao7 removal in 100 200 and 300 w us power as can be seen ao7 removal was without change in all conditions in fact increase of us power did not enhance formation of free radicals in the solution hence the us power of 100 w was adequate for the activation of pc to produce free radicals in this condition around 94 of ao7 was eliminated during 90 min reaction time 3 2 kinetic studies for ao7 degradation in different processes to confirm enhanced treatment by pc us uv leds various processes were examined for ao7 removal under the same conditions fig 3 a shows ao7 removal under conditions of ph 6 0 pc 1 5 mm and 100 w us power various processes including binary systems pc us pc uvc leds and us uvc leds and individual systems pc us and uvc leds were compared to main process pc us uv leds as shown the application of individual processes pc us and uvc leds in ao7 removal were resultless in which uvc leds and us could remove only 15 of ao7 and decolorization efficiency by sole application of pc was negligible these results demonstrated that uvc leds and us were feeble for the generation of free radicals in binary systems of pc us and pc uvc leds ao7 removal was dramatically raised to 44 and 60 2 respectively as shown uvc leds exhibited more activity for pc activation compared to us irradiation although the comparison of uvc leds and us cannot be correct in terms of mechanism it should be mentioned that the use of leds increases high efficiency thanks to the maximum emitted power 33 when uvc leds and us are combined for pc activation ao7 removal was significantly enhanced higher removal efficiency can be due to more pc activation in which a large amount of free radicals is produced in the presence of two activators uvc and us a significant enhancement of ao7 removal may be due to synergistic effect of uvc and us irradiation in this way water sonolysis results in the formation of hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen radicals eq 9 34 hydrogen radical h produced reduces hydrogen peroxide to generate more amount of hydroxyl radical eq 10 31 it was reported that this reaction is faster than reaction of hydroxyl radical with dye 35 moreover hydrogen radical in presence of hco4 may produce hydroxyl radicals and bicarbonate ions eq 11 bicarbonate ion as the precursor of hco4 propagates the production of hydroxyl radicals 9 h 2 o ho h 10 h h 2 o 2 ho h 2 o 11 hco 4 h ho hco 3 the reaction kinetic of ao7 removal was studied by pseudo first order model based on following equation 20 12 ln c 0 c k obs t where c0 and c are initial and final concentration of ao7 mg l kobs and t are rate constant min 1 and reaction time min the rate constants are calculated by plotting of ln c0 c against reaction time fig s1 fig 3b depicts the rate constant of ao7 degradation in different conditions as can be seen there is a major differentiate between pc us uvc leds process and other processes binary systems and individual systems the rate constant of ao7 removal was 0 0315 min 1 while these values were 0 0136 0 0077 and 0 003 min 1 for pc uvc leds pc us and us uvc leds respectively these results showed that the sum of rate constants of binary systems 0 0243 min 1 was still less than the main process in addition these results clearly displayed that pc role is of high importance in the generation of free radicals when binary systems of pc uvc leds and pc us were compared to us uvc leds furthermore the rate constants for sole application of each agent uv us and pc were insignificant hence it can be stated that there is a synergy in pc us uvc leds process for the generation of free radicals and ao7 degradation the application of uvc leds us carbonate ions uvc leds carbonate ions and us carbonate ions were investigated on ao7 degradation and the results are presented in fig s2 as can be seen carbonate ions had a neutral effect in these systems for the degradation of ao7 hence the contribution of carbonate radicals in degradation process was almost insignificant 3 3 the effect of water matrix the results of aops for the degradation of organic pollutants are invaluable when the effect of co existing chemicals to be evaluated anions often play a detrimental role in the performance of aops the effects of anions have been extensively studied on h2o2 and persulfate based processes in literature 36 37 however the role of anions has been rarely considered for pc based processes the effect of sulfate chloride and nitrate ions were studied in different concentrations and their results are presented in fig 4 as shown in fig 4a sulfate ions had a neutral effect on ao7 removal in concentrations of 1 and 5 mm indeed there was a negligible change in ao7 removal a slight reduction in ao7 removal efficiency took place when sulfate concentration increased to 50 mm ion intensity can affect the free radicals adversely although the presence of sulfate ions enhances the possibility of forming sulfate radicals as strong oxidation agent e0 2 5 3 1 v eq 13 38 high concentration of sulfate ions inhibits ao7 removal slightly generally it can be said that sulfate ions cannot be a serious factor for the reduction of function of pc us uvc leds process 13 ho s o 4 2 ho s o 4 the effect of chloride ions as dominant anions in most water resources have been frequently investigated fig 4b demonstrates the effect of chloride ions on ao7 removal it has been widely discussed that chloride ions have a dual role in aops some studies 39 40 demonstrated that chloride ions suppress the removal efficiency due scavenging effect and others 41 42 indicated that removal efficiency is accelerated with chloride ion in current work neutral effect of chloride in concentrations of 1 and 5 mm was clear while a promotional effect was observed in 20 mm chloride ion this enhanced degradation may be due to formation of chlorine species chloride ions may react with hydrogen peroxide to produce ocl in aqueous solution hypochlorite is in balance with hypochlorous acid hocl 36 42 in presence of uv and us irradiation hocl is decomposed to hydroxyl radicals and chlorine radicals both radicals ho and cl can break organic bonds of dye molecule to smaller compounds 43 14 cl h 2 o 2 ocl h 2 o 15 h ocl hocl 16 hocl uv and us ho cl further reactions can be continued when chloride ion reacts with hydroxyl radical to produce hocl according to eq 17 however hocl can dissociate back to ho and cl chlorine radical cl may be formed when hocl is protonated based on eq 18 this reaction is reversible in which chlorine is dominant as solution ph is less than 7 2 pk value 44 it should be considered that chloride ions are always a serious concern in aops due to possible of the formation of chloro organic compounds in water resources since these compounds are toxic and are a threat for human health and ecosystem 17 cl ho hocl 18 hocl h cl h 2 o the effect on nitrate ions on ao7 removal was tested in different concentrations nitrate ions exist in all water resources with low concentration high concentration of nitrate is representative of wastewater discharge to water bodies moreover leachate livestock wastewater and liquid fertilizer are nitrate rich water nitrate ions often scavenge hydroxyl radical to generate nitrate radical no3 with leas reactivity fig 4c shows the effect of nitrate ions on the decolorization as can be seen no significant effect on the decolorization was apperceived in 1 and 5 mm nitrate concentration on the other hand 20 mm nitrate concentration had a minor improvement in decolorization in 90 min reaction time a promotional impact for nitrate ions in uv based processes has been reported in the degradation of pharmaceuticals nitrate ions can indirectly generate hydroxyl radical according to following reactions 45 47 the rate constant of ao7 degradation was increased from 0 0314 to 0 0342 min 1 for 20 mm nitrate 19 no 3 hυ no 2 o 20 o h 2 o ho ho 21 no 3 hυ no 2 o 22 o h 2 o ho ho 23 2no 2 h 2 o no 3 no 2 2 h in this way uvc leds no3 us uvc leds no3 and us no3 processes were conducted on under condition of 20 mm nitrate ions for ao7 removal and the results are presented in fig 4d as can be seen the processes of us no3 uvc leds no3 us uvc leds no3 could degrade 12 2 26 1 and 32 3 of ao7 respectively these results confirmed promotional effect of nitrate ions on ao7 removal however us no3 process was not effective for ao7 removal which was associated with us intensity for the generation of atomic oxygen o 3 4 performance of pc us uvc leds in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts heterogeneous catalysts have been extensively applied for the activation of various chemical oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide persulfate peroxymonosulfate and ozone heterogeneous catalysts have been gained great attention for activation of oxidants due to easy recovery reusability no sludge production and application in wide range of ph 48 in fenton based process fe3o4 α fe2o3 and zvi have exhibited high efficiency in heterogeneous aops for pollutant degradation the effect of presence of iron based catalysts 0 1 g l on ao7 removal was investigated in pc us uvc leds under conditions of ph 6 0 and 1 5 mm pc and its results are demonstrated in fig 5 a in the presence of fe3o4 and zvi ao7 degradation rate was slightly enhanced the fe3o4 can activate hydrogen peroxide in the solution to generate hydroxyl radicals as several studies have demonstrated this phenomenon 49 on the other hand zvi is a source of ferrous ions that releases ferrous ions to the solution gently although the presence of these catalysts enhanced the decolorization rate this increase cannot be justifiable for adding this amount of the catalysts to pc us uvc leds on the other hands hematite α fe2o3 indicated high catalytic activity for ao7 removal in pc us uvc leds process the rate constant of ao7 degradation was increased to 0 0411 min 1 hematite is a photocatalyst which can be excited by uv irradiation to generate electron e and hole h indeed hematite can accelerate degradation efficiency of organic pollutant through two ways activation of oxidant in current work is pc and photocatalytic activity for the generation of hydroxyl radicals it should be noted that the presence of pc can also help photocatalytic activity of hematite in which hydrogen peroxide prevents the recombination of conduction electron and hole and generates hydroxyl radicals through following equation 50 51 24 f e 2 o 3 hυ h e 25 h h 2 o ho h 26 h 2 o 2 e ho ho since zvi is more effective in acidic conditions the performance of pc us uvc leds along with heterogeneous catalysts similar with fig 5a were evaluated at ph 3 0 and the results are presented in fig s3 the presence of hematite catalyst increased the decolorization significantly as well as at ph 6 0 while zvi improved the decolorization compared to magnetite catalyst because of increasing iron release at acidic condition through corrosion of zvi although zvi boosted the decolorization of ao7 hematite was still the best catalyst for pc us uvc leds thanks to photocatalytic behavior in order to demonstrate the performance of fe3o4 α fe2o3 and zvi for pc activation a series of experiments were conducted and results were presented fig 5b interestingly in binary systems fe3o4 and zvi exhibited higher function compared to α fe2o3 these results affirmed that higher efficiency of pc us uvc leds α fe2o3 is related to photocatalytic activity of α fe2o3 while its catalytic activity for pc activation was lower than fe3o4 and zvi photocatalytic activity of α fe2o3 was studied for ao7 removal in which 44 of ao7 was eliminated during 90 min reaction time in the absence of pc this result obviously presents photocatalytic activity of hematite 3 5 trapping experiments mineralization and application for actual matrix to identify reactive species for ao7 degradation two probes were added to the solution for trapping of oxidation agents a common scavenger for hydroxyl radical is tert butyl alcohol tba which has been classically used to trap hydroxyl radicals it has been reported that superoxide anion o2 may has an impressive role in the degradation of target pollutant tiron is a strong scavenger for superoxide radicals 52 fig 6 a shows ao7 removal in the presence of trapping agents of tba and tiron as can be seen tba declined ao7 degradation and showed a strong inhibitory effect as rate constant was appreciably declined to 0 0051 min 1 indicating that ao7 degradation by pc us uvc leds was under influence of hydroxyl radicals superoxide anions may be produced through the decomposition of hydroperoxyl radicals hoo the presence of tiron suppressed ao7 degradation as the rate constant reduced from 0 0315 min 1 for control condition to 0 0187 min 1 this result showed that superoxide anions were also active in pc us uvc leds process to degrade ao7 however this activity was slight compared to hydroxyl radical therefore ao7 degradation by sono photo activation of pc was mainly attributed to hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions had a minor role in degradation of ao7 mineralization of organic compounds is environmentally important since final objective of aops is the oxidation of organic pollutants to mineral compounds fig 6b depicts the mineralization degree toc removal for several conditions as can be seen mineralization degree follows the decolorization of ao7 for all processes indeed there is the same results in which observed synergy in decolorization was realized in toc removal toc removals were 48 6 37 6 and 32 for pc us uvc leds pc uvc leds and pc us respectively other processes were inconclusive in the mineralization of ao7 owing to partial amount of hydroxyl radicals actual matrix was considered for the treatment by pc us uvc leds process dyeing wastewater was chosen as an actual matrix the characteristics of dyeing wastewater is presented in table s1 fig 6c displays removal efficiency of organic content for dyeing wastewater by pc us uvc leds process under the conditions of ph 6 0 pc 1 5 mm 100 w us power and 90 min reaction time cod toc bod5 and color were monitored after the treatment in which 48 of cod 37 7 of toc 41 of bod5 and 61 of color were eliminated high organic content of dyeing wastewater and the presence of several anions declined the efficiency of pc us uvc leds compared to synthetic solution it can be stated that pc us uvc leds was relatively unsuccessful in the treatment of dyeing wastewater which was attributed to inadequate hydroxyl radicals for the degradation of organic compounds 3 6 the degradation pathway of ao7 since total mineralization of ao7 was not obtained by pc us uvc leds process the identification of by products can determine the degradation pathway of ao7 lc ms analysis was employed for the determination of these by products under conditions of pc 1 5 mm ph 6 0 after 90 min reaction time in which around 50 mineralization had been obtained lc ms spectrum is presented in fig s4 and by products are presented in table s2 proposed degradation pathway of ao7 is presented in fig 7 several studies have demonstrated the pathway degradation of ao7 by different aops it has been extensively reported that first step of oxidation is cleavage of n n in azo dyes 53 54 in current work azo bond was cleaved and two main intermediates sulfanilic acid b and 1 amino 2 naphthol e were formed in this way hydroxyl radicals attack to azo bond and sodium sulfanilamide and 1 amino 2 naphthol were appeared accordingly there are two ways for further oxidation of intermediates further oxidation of sodium sulfanilamide resulted in the production of 4 hydroxybenzensulfonic acid c after that c is hydroxylated to hydroquinone d as final aromatic intermediate in left side of fig 7 further oxidation of e led to the generation of another naphthalene compound 1 2 dihydroxynaphthalene f is formed through hydroxylation mechanism its oxidation may result in the formation of 1 2 naphthoquinone g through probably reaction of superoxide anion with f indeed three byproducts based naphthalene e f and g were generated through ao7 oxidation they are verily the simplest poly aromatic hydrocarbons which have been widely seen in degradation pathway of dyes the intermediates of f and g were oxidized to phthalate derivatives phthalic acid h and phthalic anhydride i were appeared as final aromatic intermediates in fact benzene ring of g is opened via attacking of hydroxyl radicals and phthalic acid is generated the presence of high concentration of hydroxyl radical can oxidize final aromatic compounds to aliphatic carboxylic acids with lower weigh mass and finally mineral compounds of co2 and h2o 4 conclusion sono photo activation of pc exhibited high efficiency for degradation of a sample of organic dyes more than 90 of ao7 dye was eliminated during 90 min reaction time in which optimum conditions were ph 6 0 pc 1 5 mm and us power 100 w chloride and nitrate ions showed an accelerated effect on decolorization of ao7 at high concertation photolysis of no3 degraded ao7 through the generation of free radicals the presence of iron based catalysts improved the ao7 removal especially hematite through photocatalysis mechanisms trapping experiments showed that hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion were oxidative agents for ao7 degradation in which hydroxyl radical had a bold role in ao7 degradation although decolorization of ao7 was effective in synthetic solution the performance of pc us uvc leds was unsuccessful for actual dyeing wastewater due to complexity of the wastewater in terms of organic and inorganic compounds the degradation pathway of ao7 was proposed while eight main by products were identified overall our suggested method provided a new approach for effectively degradation of organic dye further studies can be focused on combination of pc us uvc leds with biological processes for actual wastewater treatment declaration of competing interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

14140,several efforts have been conducted to reach an efficient and safe process for degradation of organic pollutants in water environments percarbonate pc or solid hydrogen peroxide has gained great attention as an alternative for hydrogen peroxide in advanced oxidation processes in current work sono photo activation method was used to pc activation for degradation of acid orange 7 ao7 ultrasound us and ultraviolet light emitted diode uvc leds were prosperous in the generation of free radicals in presence of pc under optimum conditions ph 6 0 pc 1 5 mm 100 w us power and 90 reaction time 93 of ao7 was eliminated while its rate constant was 0 0315 min 1 there was a promotional effect for chloride and nitrate ions at high concentration in pc us uvc leds process nitrate ions photolysis and sonolysis could degrade ao7 indicating that hydroxyl radical are generated in absent of pc a major role for hydroxyl radical and minor role for superoxide radical were determined by trapping experiments pc us uvc leds was also applied for an actual matrix which was not successful as well as synthetic solution by products of ao7 degradation was identified and proposed reaction was illustrated this article conclusively states that pc us uvc leds can be a new method for the degradation of organic pollutants in water keywords percarbonate organic dye uvc leds ultrasound advanced oxidation processes 1 introduction numerous studies have been focused on dye degradation and treatment of colored wastewater in the past half century dyes are organic pollutants which are determined by absorbing the visible region 400 700 nm of the electromagnetic spectrum among various groups of dyes azo dyes nitrogen to nitrogen double bonds are of high importance because of large volume of their production 50 of all dyes produced are in class of azo dyes 1 2 they have been used in different industries and manufactures such as textile industry cosmetic manufacture food and pharmaceutical sector there are several environmental concerns about azo dyes in water including coloring water resource toxicity for aquatic microorganism and the presence of their degradation by products which may be more toxic than mother molecule 3 4 recently environmental engineers have endeavored to find an effective solution for the degradation of azo dye in contaminated water and treatment of colored wastewater in order to complete decolorization and high mineralization degree advanced oxidation processes aops have been suggested by water and wastewater experts 5 aops produce reactive oxygen species ros especially hydroxyl radicals ho e0 2 8 v to destruct organic bond of dyes thanks to high oxidation potential and non selectivity in chemical reaction 6 7 to produce hydroxyl radicals several methods have been examined including fenton oxidation photocatalysis ozonation radiolysis sonoloysis and electrolysis processes 8 the use of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 has been proposed for the generation of hydroxyl radicals in which transition metals ultraviolet uv and ultrasound us irradiations are known as the activators of h2o2 for ho generation 9 10 although transition metals have proved the high performance in catalyzing h2o2 their residuals and recovery are so difficult 11 recent studies have exhibited high function of uv and us irradiation in activation of chemical oxidants in water and wastewater treatment uv and us can activate hydrogen peroxide and produce hydroxyl radicals based on following equation 12 13 1 h 2 o 2 us or uv ho ho in recent years other chemical oxidants have been applied instead of hydrogen peroxide persulfate and peroxymonosulfate anions have attained abundant regard owning to high potential of sulfate radicals however sulfate ions as by product are the most important of limitation in their application 14 15 although hydrogen peroxide is an inexpensive and powerful oxidant for water and wastewater treatment its application is always a serious challenge in large scale the use storage and transportation of concentrated hydrogen peroxide is difficult in terms of safety and stability the rate of h2o2 decomposition increases approximately 2 2 times for each 10 rise in temperature in the range from 20 to 100 in addition reactivity and corrosivity of h2o2 is a big problem for facilities and instruments 16 sodium percarbonate 2na2co3 3h2o2 has been known as an oxidative agent for synthesis of various organic compounds sodium percarbonate can be an alternative for h2o2 in aops indeed percarbonate pc is solid hydrogen peroxide in which it releases hydrogen peroxide when it is dissolved in water pc can be easily stored and handled that it can compensate its higher material cost compared to hydrogen peroxide price of pc is three time more than that of h2o2 17 20 moreover the presence of carbonate ion in structure of pc prevents the acidification of water resources especially groundwater sodium carbonate is a safe and neutral by product which is present in water resources pc can act in wide range of ph which is a superiority compared to fenton oxidation recently pc has been widely used for degradation of organic pollutants in presence of transition metal like fenton oxidation 21 22 the sono activation and photo activation methods perform often under mild conditions with simple instruments and easy operation 23 moreover pc uv also showed high efficiency for degradation of pharmaceutical compounds 17 high energy input can extremely activate pc for the production of free radicals however no study has been investigated on us pc for degradation of organic pollutant in aqueous solution uvc light emitting diodes led has not been studied for pc activation yet besides simultaneous usages of us and uvc leds for pc activation is first study in environmental application of pc for degradation of organic dyes in this study us uvc leds activated pc process was used to degrade a sample of organic dye acid orange 7 for the first time the operational parameters were evaluated on ao7 removal with focus on ph pc dosage reaction time and determination of reaction rate constant the effects of some anions were studied on ao7 removal various iron based heterogeneous catalyst were applied as a promotor and their results were also reported the performance of pc us uvc leds was tested for an actual wastewater treatment mineralization and by products were also determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals acid orang 7 c16h11n2nao4s was purchased from alvan sabet inc with purity more than 98

16 cm height 300 ml of 25 mg l ao7 solution was added into the reactor in order to adjust solution ph sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide were utilized with precision of 0 02 for ph value a q125 ultrasonic generator 100 200 300 w 20 khz equipped with an ultrasonic probe was selected for sonication of dye solution to irradiate uvc light 6 uvc leds 1 w 258 262 nm were applied for this purpose 3 leds at the left side of reactor and 3 leds at the right of the reactor were set up to make a balance of irradiation for dye solution there was a 50 mm distance between reactor and uvc leds an electronic chip was exerted to install all uvc leds which was operated by a dc power 2000 ma 30 0 v the uvc intensity in center of the rector was 2 55 2 71 mw cm2 pc in different dosages 0 5 2 mm was added to the dye solution while mixing was conducted a magnetic stirrer sonication instrument and uvc leds were simultaneously turn on to start photo sono activation of pc to degrade ao7 the mixing was conducted by a small mechanical stirrer when fe3o4 and zvi were used at regular time intervals sampling was conducted and the remaining ao7 was immediately analyzed for measurement of toc sodium nitrite was used a strong quencher all experiments were carried out in triplicate and average value was used in the results standard deviation was less than 2 9 for all experiments the scheme of pc us uvc leds process is presented in fig 1 2 3 analytical method ao7 absorbancy was determined by a spectrophotometer elmer perkin at the wavelength of 485 nm as the wavelength of maximum absorbance of ao7 toc values were determined by toc analyzer shimadzo japan h2o2 was measured by iodometric titration method admi american dye manufacturers institute method was used for color measurement in actual wastewater using a spectrophotometer hach dr5000 chemical oxygen demand cod and 5 days biochemical oxygen demand bod5 were determined according to standard methods 24 total dissolved solids tds iron concentration and chloride ions were measured by gravimetric phenanthroline spectrophotometric and argentometric method respectively to identify degradation by products the sample was analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy lc ms water 2695 milford ma a capillary column c 18 5μm 50 mm length was used for separation of product intermediates the mobile phase was a mixture of water and acetonitrile 50 50 v v which was adjusted by 10 mm ammonium acetate and 0 05 acetic acid the flow rate of elute was 0 5 ml min 1 and 20 μl of the sample was injected to the instrument actual dyeing wastewater was collected from semnan province in iran in which it consisting of dyeing mercerization and washing effluents 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of ph pc dosage and us power the solution ph is a critical factor in aops for the degradation of organic compounds the effect of solution ph was investigated in range of 3 0 9 0 fig 2 a indicates ao7 removal in various ph values in fixed conditions of 1 mm pc and 100 w us power within 90 min reaction time as can be see the decolorization was in range of 65 85 for all ph values expect for ph 9 0 the most efficiency was observed in ph 6 0 with 85 decolorization theoretically in ph values of 4 5 8 3 bicarbonate ions are predominant in the solutions in which pc is hydrolyzed based on eq 2 according to carbonate equilibrium carbonate co3 2 species is dominated at alkaline conditions it may be possible formation of carbonate radical co3 which is a low active radical with redox potential e0 of 1 63 v at ph 8 4 and 1 59 at ph 12 25 on the other hand bicarbonate ions react directly with hydrogen peroxide to produce peroxymonocarbonate ion hco4 eq 3 17 after that photolysis and sonolysis of hco4 results in the formation of hydroxyl radicals and carbonate radicals eq 4 besides the redox potential of hydroxyl radical depends on the ph value in which with increase of ph declines its redox potential e0 1 9 v at ph 7 0 and e0 2 65 2 8 at ph 3 0 26 hence ph can govern the performance of pc us uvc leds process in aqueous solution in fact ph value is an influential factor in carbonate species and power of hydroxyl radical the lowest efficiency in decolorization was attributed to ph 9 0 with 52 regarding above description at ph higher than 8 3 dye removal is under influence of reduction of hydroxyl radical power and carbonate species 2 2nac o 3 3h 2 o 2 h 2 o 3h 2 o 2 2hc o 3 2n a 1 2 o 2 3 hco 3 h 2 o 2 hco 4 h 2 o 4 hco 4 uv or us ho co 3 fig 2b shows changes of solution ph during 90 min reaction time under the conditions of 1 mm pc and 100 w us power within 90 min reaction time it has been reported that hydrogen peroxide usually reduces solution ph while carbonate ions increase of ph value as shown in this figure ph values were increased slightly during 90 min reaction in all conditions the increase of ph was less than 1 unit indicating that the changes of ph are insignificant in pc us uvc leds process indeed interaction of hydrogen peroxide and carbonate ions induces a slight change in solution ph accordingly ph 6 0 had the highest dye removal efficiency and ph of solution is raised to 6 77 after 90 min reaction time this output can be considerable for next treatment process if pc us uvc leds process was operated as pretreatment in integrated processes in which biological process is performed as post treatment in other words ph 6 77 is favorable for biological process in which microorganisms activity is conducted in range of 6 0 8 0 27 the effect of pc dosage on ao7 removal was examined under conditions of ph 6 0 and 100 w us power fig 2c shows ao7 removal in different pc dosages in literature it has been mostly reported that the increase in oxidant dosage enhances degradation process as shown increase in pc dosage boosted the decolorization when pc dosage was increased from 0 5 mm to 1 5 mm in this way ao7 removals in 90 min were 70 1 85 0 93 7 and 80 2 for 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 mm respectively a decrease was obtained in 2 mm pc dosage this phenomenon can be related to classical scavenging of hydroxyl radials via higher dosage of oxidants which has been broadly reported in literature 28 29 in fact higher dosage of oxidant h2o2 or pc may scavenge hydroxyl radical to produce hydroperoxyl radicals ho2 with weaker reactivity for the degradation of organic contaminants eq 5 30 moreover the recombination of free radicals can be also a hypothesis for decrease of removal efficiency based on eqs 6 8 31 32 5 ho h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o 6 ho 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 7 ho ho h 2 o 2 8 ho 2 ho o 2 h 2 o the effect of us power was studied under optimized previous steps in which three levels of us power were investigated at ph 6 0 and 1 5 mm pc dosage fig 2d presents ao7 removal in 100 200 and 300 w us power as can be seen ao7 removal was without change in all conditions in fact increase of us power did not enhance formation of free radicals in the solution hence the us power of 100 w was adequate for the activation of pc to produce free radicals in this condition around 94 of ao7 was eliminated during 90 min reaction time 3 2 kinetic studies for ao7 degradation in different processes to confirm enhanced treatment by pc us uv leds various processes were examined for ao7 removal under the same conditions fig 3 a shows ao7 removal under conditions of ph 6 0 pc 1 5 mm and 100 w us power various processes including binary systems pc us pc uvc leds and us uvc leds and individual systems pc us and uvc leds were compared to main process pc us uv leds as shown the application of individual processes pc us and uvc leds in ao7 removal were resultless in which uvc leds and us could remove only 15 of ao7 and decolorization efficiency by sole application of pc was negligible these results demonstrated that uvc leds and us were feeble for the generation of free radicals in binary systems of pc us and pc uvc leds ao7 removal was dramatically raised to 44 and 60 2 respectively as shown uvc leds exhibited more activity for pc activation compared to us irradiation although the comparison of uvc leds and us cannot be correct in terms of mechanism it should be mentioned that the use of leds increases high efficiency thanks to the maximum emitted power 33 when uvc leds and us are combined for pc activation ao7 removal was significantly enhanced higher removal efficiency can be due to more pc activation in which a large amount of free radicals is produced in the presence of two activators uvc and us a significant enhancement of ao7 removal may be due to synergistic effect of uvc and us irradiation in this way water sonolysis results in the formation of hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen radicals eq 9 34 hydrogen radical h produced reduces hydrogen peroxide to generate more amount of hydroxyl radical eq 10 31 it was reported that this reaction is faster than reaction of hydroxyl radical with dye 35 moreover hydrogen radical in presence of hco4 may produce hydroxyl radicals and bicarbonate ions eq 11 bicarbonate ion as the precursor of hco4 propagates the production of hydroxyl radicals 9 h 2 o ho h 10 h h 2 o 2 ho h 2 o 11 hco 4 h ho hco 3 the reaction kinetic of ao7 removal was studied by pseudo first order model based on following equation 20 12 ln c 0 c k obs t where c0 and c are initial and final concentration of ao7 mg l kobs and t are rate constant min 1 and reaction time min the rate constants are calculated by plotting of ln c0 c against reaction time fig s1 fig 3b depicts the rate constant of ao7 degradation in different conditions as can be seen there is a major differentiate between pc us uvc leds process and other processes binary systems and individual systems the rate constant of ao7 removal was 0 0315 min 1 while these values were 0 0136 0 0077 and 0 003 min 1 for pc uvc leds pc us and us uvc leds respectively these results showed that the sum of rate constants of binary systems 0 0243 min 1 was still less than the main process in addition these results clearly displayed that pc role is of high importance in the generation of free radicals when binary systems of pc uvc leds and pc us were compared to us uvc leds furthermore the rate constants for sole application of each agent uv us and pc were insignificant hence it can be stated that there is a synergy in pc us uvc leds process for the generation of free radicals and ao7 degradation the application of uvc leds us carbonate ions uvc leds carbonate ions and us carbonate ions were investigated on ao7 degradation and the results are presented in fig s2 as can be seen carbonate ions had a neutral effect in these systems for the degradation of ao7 hence the contribution of carbonate radicals in degradation process was almost insignificant 3 3 the effect of water matrix the results of aops for the degradation of organic pollutants are invaluable when the effect of co existing chemicals to be evaluated anions often play a detrimental role in the performance of aops the effects of anions have been extensively studied on h2o2 and persulfate based processes in literature 36 37 however the role of anions has been rarely considered for pc based processes the effect of sulfate chloride and nitrate ions were studied in different concentrations and their results are presented in fig 4 as shown in fig 4a sulfate ions had a neutral effect on ao7 removal in concentrations of 1 and 5 mm indeed there was a negligible change in ao7 removal a slight reduction in ao7 removal efficiency took place when sulfate concentration increased to 50 mm ion intensity can affect the free radicals adversely although the presence of sulfate ions enhances the possibility of forming sulfate radicals as strong oxidation agent e0 2 5 3 1 v eq 13 38 high concentration of sulfate ions inhibits ao7 removal slightly generally it can be said that sulfate ions cannot be a serious factor for the reduction of function of pc us uvc leds process 13 ho s o 4 2 ho s o 4 the effect of chloride ions as dominant anions in most water resources have been frequently investigated fig 4b demonstrates the effect of chloride ions on ao7 removal it has been widely discussed that chloride ions have a dual role in aops some studies 39 40 demonstrated that chloride ions suppress the removal efficiency due scavenging effect and others 41 42 indicated that removal efficiency is accelerated with chloride ion in current work neutral effect of chloride in concentrations of 1 and 5 mm was clear while a promotional effect was observed in 20 mm chloride ion this enhanced degradation may be due to formation of chlorine species chloride ions may react with hydrogen peroxide to produce ocl in aqueous solution hypochlorite is in balance with hypochlorous acid hocl 36 42 in presence of uv and us irradiation hocl is decomposed to hydroxyl radicals and chlorine radicals both radicals ho and cl can break organic bonds of dye molecule to smaller compounds 43 14 cl h 2 o 2 ocl h 2 o 15 h ocl hocl 16 hocl uv and us ho cl further reactions can be continued when chloride ion reacts with hydroxyl radical to produce hocl according to eq 17 however hocl can dissociate back to ho and cl chlorine radical cl may be formed when hocl is protonated based on eq 18 this reaction is reversible in which chlorine is dominant as solution ph is less than 7 2 pk value 44 it should be considered that chloride ions are always a serious concern in aops due to possible of the formation of chloro organic compounds in water resources since these compounds are toxic and are a threat for human health and ecosystem 17 cl ho hocl 18 hocl h cl h 2 o the effect on nitrate ions on ao7 removal was tested in different concentrations nitrate ions exist in all water resources with low concentration high concentration of nitrate is representative of wastewater discharge to water bodies moreover leachate livestock wastewater and liquid fertilizer are nitrate rich water nitrate ions often scavenge hydroxyl radical to generate nitrate radical no3 with leas reactivity fig 4c shows the effect of nitrate ions on the decolorization as can be seen no significant effect on the decolorization was apperceived in 1 and 5 mm nitrate concentration on the other hand 20 mm nitrate concentration had a minor improvement in decolorization in 90 min reaction time a promotional impact for nitrate ions in uv based processes has been reported in the degradation of pharmaceuticals nitrate ions can indirectly generate hydroxyl radical according to following reactions 45 47 the rate constant of ao7 degradation was increased from 0 0314 to 0 0342 min 1 for 20 mm nitrate 19 no 3 hυ no 2 o 20 o h 2 o ho ho 21 no 3 hυ no 2 o 22 o h 2 o ho ho 23 2no 2 h 2 o no 3 no 2 2 h in this way uvc leds no3 us uvc leds no3 and us no3 processes were conducted on under condition of 20 mm nitrate ions for ao7 removal and the results are presented in fig 4d as can be seen the processes of us no3 uvc leds no3 us uvc leds no3 could degrade 12 2 26 1 and 32 3 of ao7 respectively these results confirmed promotional effect of nitrate ions on ao7 removal however us no3 process was not effective for ao7 removal which was associated with us intensity for the generation of atomic oxygen o 3 4 performance of pc us uvc leds in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts heterogeneous catalysts have been extensively applied for the activation of various chemical oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide persulfate peroxymonosulfate and ozone heterogeneous catalysts have been gained great attention for activation of oxidants due to easy recovery reusability no sludge production and application in wide range of ph 48 in fenton based process fe3o4 α fe2o3 and zvi have exhibited high efficiency in heterogeneous aops for pollutant degradation the effect of presence of iron based catalysts 0 1 g l on ao7 removal was investigated in pc us uvc leds under conditions of ph 6 0 and 1 5 mm pc and its results are demonstrated in fig 5 a in the presence of fe3o4 and zvi ao7 degradation rate was slightly enhanced the fe3o4 can activate hydrogen peroxide in the solution to generate hydroxyl radicals as several studies have demonstrated this phenomenon 49 on the other hand zvi is a source of ferrous ions that releases ferrous ions to the solution gently although the presence of these catalysts enhanced the decolorization rate this increase cannot be justifiable for adding this amount of the catalysts to pc us uvc leds on the other hands hematite α fe2o3 indicated high catalytic activity for ao7 removal in pc us uvc leds process the rate constant of ao7 degradation was increased to 0 0411 min 1 hematite is a photocatalyst which can be excited by uv irradiation to generate electron e and hole h indeed hematite can accelerate degradation efficiency of organic pollutant through two ways activation of oxidant in current work is pc and photocatalytic activity for the generation of hydroxyl radicals it should be noted that the presence of pc can also help photocatalytic activity of hematite in which hydrogen peroxide prevents the recombination of conduction electron and hole and generates hydroxyl radicals through following equation 50 51 24 f e 2 o 3 hυ h e 25 h h 2 o ho h 26 h 2 o 2 e ho ho since zvi is more effective in acidic conditions the performance of pc us uvc leds along with heterogeneous catalysts similar with fig 5a were evaluated at ph 3 0 and the results are presented in fig s3 the presence of hematite catalyst increased the decolorization significantly as well as at ph 6 0 while zvi improved the decolorization compared to magnetite catalyst because of increasing iron release at acidic condition through corrosion of zvi although zvi boosted the decolorization of ao7 hematite was still the best catalyst for pc us uvc leds thanks to photocatalytic behavior in order to demonstrate the performance of fe3o4 α fe2o3 and zvi for pc activation a series of experiments were conducted and results were presented fig 5b interestingly in binary systems fe3o4 and zvi exhibited higher function compared to α fe2o3 these results affirmed that higher efficiency of pc us uvc leds α fe2o3 is related to photocatalytic activity of α fe2o3 while its catalytic activity for pc activation was lower than fe3o4 and zvi photocatalytic activity of α fe2o3 was studied for ao7 removal in which 44 of ao7 was eliminated during 90 min reaction time in the absence of pc this result obviously presents photocatalytic activity of hematite 3 5 trapping experiments mineralization and application for actual matrix to identify reactive species for ao7 degradation two probes were added to the solution for trapping of oxidation agents a common scavenger for hydroxyl radical is tert butyl alcohol tba which has been classically used to trap hydroxyl radicals it has been reported that superoxide anion o2 may has an impressive role in the degradation of target pollutant tiron is a strong scavenger for superoxide radicals 52 fig 6 a shows ao7 removal in the presence of trapping agents of tba and tiron as can be seen tba declined ao7 degradation and showed a strong inhibitory effect as rate constant was appreciably declined to 0 0051 min 1 indicating that ao7 degradation by pc us uvc leds was under influence of hydroxyl radicals superoxide anions may be produced through the decomposition of hydroperoxyl radicals hoo the presence of tiron suppressed ao7 degradation as the rate constant reduced from 0 0315 min 1 for control condition to 0 0187 min 1 this result showed that superoxide anions were also active in pc us uvc leds process to degrade ao7 however this activity was slight compared to hydroxyl radical therefore ao7 degradation by sono photo activation of pc was mainly attributed to hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions had a minor role in degradation of ao7 mineralization of organic compounds is environmentally important since final objective of aops is the oxidation of organic pollutants to mineral compounds fig 6b depicts the mineralization degree toc removal for several conditions as can be seen mineralization degree follows the decolorization of ao7 for all processes indeed there is the same results in which observed synergy in decolorization was realized in toc removal toc removals were 48 6 37 6 and 32 for pc us uvc leds pc uvc leds and pc us respectively other processes were inconclusive in the mineralization of ao7 owing to partial amount of hydroxyl radicals actual matrix was considered for the treatment by pc us uvc leds process dyeing wastewater was chosen as an actual matrix the characteristics of dyeing wastewater is presented in table s1 fig 6c displays removal efficiency of organic content for dyeing wastewater by pc us uvc leds process under the conditions of ph 6 0 pc 1 5 mm 100 w us power and 90 min reaction time cod toc bod5 and color were monitored after the treatment in which 48 of cod 37 7 of toc 41 of bod5 and 61 of color were eliminated high organic content of dyeing wastewater and the presence of several anions declined the efficiency of pc us uvc leds compared to synthetic solution it can be stated that pc us uvc leds was relatively unsuccessful in the treatment of dyeing wastewater which was attributed to inadequate hydroxyl radicals for the degradation of organic compounds 3 6 the degradation pathway of ao7 since total mineralization of ao7 was not obtained by pc us uvc leds process the identification of by products can determine the degradation pathway of ao7 lc ms analysis was employed for the determination of these by products under conditions of pc 1 5 mm ph 6 0 after 90 min reaction time in which around 50 mineralization had been obtained lc ms spectrum is presented in fig s4 and by products are presented in table s2 proposed degradation pathway of ao7 is presented in fig 7 several studies have demonstrated the pathway degradation of ao7 by different aops it has been extensively reported that first step of oxidation is cleavage of n n in azo dyes 53 54 in current work azo bond was cleaved and two main intermediates sulfanilic acid b and 1 amino 2 naphthol e were formed in this way hydroxyl radicals attack to azo bond and sodium sulfanilamide and 1 amino 2 naphthol were appeared accordingly there are two ways for further oxidation of intermediates further oxidation of sodium sulfanilamide resulted in the production of 4 hydroxybenzensulfonic acid c after that c is hydroxylated to hydroquinone d as final aromatic intermediate in left side of fig 7 further oxidation of e led to the generation of another naphthalene compound 1 2 dihydroxynaphthalene f is formed through hydroxylation mechanism its oxidation may result in the formation of 1 2 naphthoquinone g through probably reaction of superoxide anion with f indeed three byproducts based naphthalene e f and g were generated through ao7 oxidation they are verily the simplest poly aromatic hydrocarbons which have been widely seen in degradation pathway of dyes the intermediates of f and g were oxidized to phthalate derivatives phthalic acid h and phthalic anhydride i were appeared as final aromatic intermediates in fact benzene ring of g is opened via attacking of hydroxyl radicals and phthalic acid is generated the presence of high concentration of hydroxyl radical can oxidize final aromatic compounds to aliphatic carboxylic acids with lower weigh mass and finally mineral compounds of co2 and h2o 4 conclusion sono photo activation of pc exhibited high efficiency for degradation of a sample of organic dyes more than 90 of ao7 dye was eliminated during 90 min reaction time in which optimum conditions were ph 6 0 pc 1 5 mm and us power 100 w chloride and nitrate ions showed an accelerated effect on decolorization of ao7 at high concertation photolysis of no3 degraded ao7 through the generation of free radicals the presence of iron based catalysts improved the ao7 removal especially hematite through photocatalysis mechanisms trapping experiments showed that hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion were oxidative agents for ao7 degradation in which hydroxyl radical had a bold role in ao7 degradation although decolorization of ao7 was effective in synthetic solution the performance of pc us uvc leds was unsuccessful for actual dyeing wastewater due to complexity of the wastewater in terms of organic and inorganic compounds the degradation pathway of ao7 was proposed while eight main by products were identified overall our suggested method provided a new approach for effectively degradation of organic dye further studies can be focused on combination of pc us uvc leds with biological processes for actual wastewater treatment declaration of competing interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

14141,thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes incorporated with carbon nitride cn or protonated cn pcn were fabricated for forward osmosis fo desalination the cn and pcn were incorporated within the polyamide pa layer which was supported by pcn incorporated polysulfone psf substrate to form the tfn membrane it was found that the presence of pcn in the substrate has favourably altered the intrinsic properties and affected the formation of pa layer the physico chemical characterizations indicated that the presence of both cn and pcn enhanced the surface hydrophilicity but reduced the surface negativity of the pa layer these features have resulted in the improved water transport and salt rejective ability as a result cn pcn tfn membranes exhibited improved water permeability by about 70 0 67 l m2 h bar compared to tfc membrane while maintaining salt rejection of 94 5 cn pcn tfn also exhibited better anti fouling property compared to tfc in which the flux decline was only half of that of tfc membrane during the 9 h antifouling test this work demonstrates the feasibility of using functional cn and pcn to independently tailor the substrate and pa layer properties of the tfn membrane hence improving the desalination performances of the membrane keywords carbon nitride reverse osmosis forward osmosis thin film nanocomposite 1 introduction human population in the world has reached 7 billion in 2015 and the number keeps increasing with nearly 250 thousand added daily the population is expected to reach 9 7 billion by 2050 1 the major issue that accompanies the exponentially growth population is the shortage of fresh water supply as reported by united nations world water development in 2015 780 million people did not have access to safe drinking water and this number is expected to raise in the coming years 2 3 numerous alternatives have been considered to address this global challenge desalination is one of the most promising methods to recover fresh water supply considering the amount of seawater that exist and the limited resources of fresh water available 4 6 forward osmosis fo has attracted attention in the desalination community due to its desirable features for sustainable desalination process 7 by carefully selecting an appropriate draw solution and a regeneration approach that requires low energy consumption fo holds great potential as an alternative to commercially used ro 8 currently the main obstacle that limits the performance of fo is the internal concentration polarization icp 9 icp is a phenomenon resulted from the accumulation of solutes inside of the pore of the membrane which in turn changes the effective osmotic pressure that act as driving force 10 thin film composite tfc membrane has been widely used for fo desalination owing to its high salt rejection and water flux typically tfc comprises of a polyamide pa layer which is fabricated on top of a polymeric substrate through an interfacial polymerization ip process 4 11 over the last decade the advancement made in nanoscience and materials has provided unprecedented means to address the underlying issues related to the limitations of tfc membranes the incorporation of various functional nanomaterials in thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes has rendered some attractive features to strengthen the membrane properties such as anti fouling membrane morphology and most importantly the performance the first attempt of making such effort can be dated back to 2007 where nanoparticles such as zeolite and carbon nanotubes cnt were introduced to improve the mechanical chemical thermal and separation behaviour of the membrane 12 recently graphene based nanomaterials and metal oxide framework mof have been the subjects of focus as they are known to provide high permeability and selectivity to the resultant tfn hence greatly reduce the energy consumption in filtration while maintaining high recovery 13 the incorporation of nanomaterials with super hydrophilic properties and negative surface charges is able to improve the anti fouling performance and permeability without sacrificing the superior salt rejection 14 as reported by pan et al 15 blending of imogolite nanotubes into the psf substrates has significantly improved the hydrophilicity water flux porosity and roughness of the membrane surface ghanbari et al who reported the blending of hnt within psf substrates have also observed enhancement in the water permeability due to increase in hydrophilicity and porosity of the resultant tfn compared to the tfc membrane 10 additionally emadzadeh et al reported that the embedment of titanate nanotubes nh2 tnts in pa layer has improved the tfn salt rejection by 2 and water flux by almost two folds compared to that of tfc 16 recently graphitic carbon nitride cn has attracted attention in various applications 17 cn forms graphene like nanosheets structure and has a diamond like mechanical properties 18 19 cn can be used as metal free photocatalyst for the degradation of organic pollutions owing to its special optical feature high thermal stability and chemical stability 20 according to wang et al cn has the potential to enhance wettability of composite substrate through the interaction of hydrogen bonding of water molecules with the nitrogen atoms of cn 21 surface modification of nanomaterials is a common strategy to further enhance the functionality or to improve the dispersibility of the nanomaterials when incorporated into polymeric matrix one of the easiest ways to introduce functional groups to the surface of nanomaterials is through acid modification oxidation of the nanomaterials by acid treatment improves the dispersion of the nanomaterials through the generation of hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups on the nanomaterials structure 22 wan azelee et al 4 improved the dispersion of multiwalled carbon nanotube and titania nanotube mwcnt tnt hybrid in tmc solution by treating the nanomaterials with sulphuric acid the embedment of this acid treated hybrid into the pa layer has rendered negative charges and allowed better interaction between the water molecule and the selective layer to produce a highly permeable tfn without compromising the selectivity in this study cn was treated with acid to modify the surface charges and functionalities of the nanomaterials this protonated cn pcn was then dispersed into psf dope solution to fabricate nanocomposite substrate additionally tfns containing cn or pcn within the selective layer have also been fabricated the resultant membranes were subjected to various characterizations to investigate the effects of cn and pcn towards the physico chemical properties of the tfn membranes finally the desalination performance was evaluated in terms of the flux and selectivity in ro and fo system this work represents the first attempt of using cn and pcn to fabricate tfn membrane hence it may provide new insights into the potentials of these nanomaterials in enhancing the performance of tfn for desalination 2 experimental 2 1 materials polysulfone udels p 3500 lcd mb3 polymer supplied in a form of

carbon nitride and acid treatment melamine precursors were used to synthesize cn through a thermal polycondensation method 23 in a typical procedure 15 g of melamine powder was filled into an alumina crucible with lid next the crucible was heated to 550 c in air condition using carbolite muffle furnace with a heating rate of 5 c min the furnace temperature was maintained at 550 c for 2 h before the heating element was turned off to allow the furnace to cool naturally after the setup was cooled to room temperature the resulted yellow product was collected and ground into a powder with a ceramic mortar for a further use for the synthesis of pcn 10 ml of 5 m hydrochloric acid was mixed with each gram of cn used the suspension was then stirred overnight followed by filtration and washing with deionised water to neutralize the product lastly the pale yellow powder was ground and dried overnight at 100 c under vacuum condition 2 3 preparation of polysulfone psf support membrane

stirred for 24 h to ensure proper dissolution of psf pellets and homogeneous dispersion of pcn after that the dope solution was degassed via sonication in a room temperature for 1 to 2 h the degassed dope solution was casted onto a clean glass plate using a glass rod then immediately immersed into a coagulation bath containing deionised di water after 2 min the solidified psf sheet was peeled from the glass plate transferred into a second di water bath and kept overnight to ensure that remnant solvent within the psf substrate was removed for the preparation of pcn incorporated psf substrate pcn psf the same procedure for preparing neat psf was used except 0 5 wt of pcn was added into the dope solution 2 4 preparation of thin film composite and thin film nanocomposite membranes pa active layer was formed on top of the psf substrate via ip method using 2 w v of mpd in deionised water and 0 1 w v tmc in n hexane first the substrate membrane was fixed in between a glass plate and a rubber frame then the mpd solution was poured into the setup to saturate the exposed side of psf with the diamine monomer after 1 min excess mpd solution was drained off and the leftover droplets were remove using a rubber roller next tmc solution was dripped onto the mpd saturated surface to initiate the ip process after 50 s excess tmc solution was poured out and the resulted tfc was left to dry in ambient temperature for 1 min before thermally treated in oven at 60 c for 5 min lastly the membrane was stored in di water for 24 h before further use for the fabrication of tfn membrane 0 05 w v of pcn or cn was dispersed into the tmc solution the mixture was then sonicated for 1 h prior to ip to avoid agglomeration of the nanoparticles the denotations of the tfn membranes prepared in this study are tabulated in table 1 2 5 characterization of nanomaterials and membranes the morphology of cn and pcn was examined using transmission electron microscopy tem ht 770 hitachi japan for this purpose small amount of the powdered sample was dispersed in water via 1 h sonication after standing for 10 min the supernatant of the suspension solution was drawn out using a clean pipette then dropped onto a copper grid to deposit the nanomaterials on the grid the loaded copper grid was dried in oven at 60 c for 10 min before analysis x ray diffraction spectroscopy xrd cu kα radiation λ 0 154 nm d max rb 12 kw rigaku was used to examine the crystallinity of the synthesized nanomaterials the fine sample powder was packed onto a sample holder before loaded into the xrd spectrometer the scanning was carried out at 2θ between 4 and 70 the functional groups of cn and pcn were identified via fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo nicolet avatar 360 the sample was mixed with kbr powder via grinding for 2 min then the homogenized powder was compressed into a thin pellet using a stainless steel die the pellet was loaded into the sample holder and the ftir scanning was carried out at wavenumber between 400 cm 1 and 4000 cm 1 to determine the surface charge surface zeta potential malvern zetasizer nano zs was used the sample were prepared by using deionized water as a medium ph neutral at room temperature and with dispersant dielectric constant of 78 5 for membrane sample average pore diameter and porosity of the psf and pcn psf substrate were determined by using mercury porosimeter microactive autopore v 9600 micromeritics instrument corp ftir was conducted in attenuated total reflectance mode atr ftir by switching the pellet holder of the spectrometer into atr accessories membrane sample was cut into strips then clamped on the atr probe and scanned at wavenumber between 600 cm 1 and 4000 cm 1 other than that the morphological structure of the membrane was investigated using field emission scanning electronic microscope fesem su8020 hitachi prior to scanning membrane sample was cut into a 10 mm 2 mm strip taped onto a metallic stub using carbon tape

2 6 evaluation of membrane performances dead end filtration system was used to measure ro performance that was made of stainless steel 316 model hp4750 stirred cell sterlitech corp kent wa the membrane active surface area am was 14 6 cm2 2 26 in2 firstly the membrane was stabilized at 16 bar for 30 min with ro water to compact the structure of the membrane then the feed pressure δp in bar was adjusted to 15 bar and the rate of water permeated through the membrane q in l h 1 was measured based on the results the water permeability was calculated using the equation below water permeability l m 2 h 1 b a r 1 or lmh bar 1 q a m δp next the content of the filtration cell was replaced with nacl solution 2000 ppm for further testing the conductivity of the permeated solution was measured using jenway conductivity meter model 4520 since conductivity is linearly correlated to the concentration of the salt solution the salt rejection was determined based the equation below salt rejection 1 c p c f 100 where cp is the conductivity of permeate solution and cf is the conductivity of feed solution other than that filtration performance of the membrane in two fo modes i e active layer facing feed solution al fs and active layer facing draw solution al ds were also tested for this experiment ptfe cell cf016p fo cell with am of 20 6 cm2 3 2 inch2 which was supplied by sterlitech corp was used the draw solution consisted of 2 mol l 1 nacl while distilled water was used as the feed solution respectively prior to variables measurement membrane sample was first stabilized for 30 min after that the changes in the weight of draw solution and the conductivity of feed solution were monitored and recorded for every 30 min test using digital weighing balance model gx 12 k a d company limited toshima ku tokyo and portable conductivity meter model pro30 ysi yellow springs oh respectively 3 4 consistent readings were taken to compute the average water flux j v in lmh and reverse solute flux j s in gmh the following equations were used for the calculation of j v and j s respectively j v δm δt a m ρ h 2 o j s δ c t v t δt a m where ρ h 2 o is the density in g l 1 of water while δt is the duration in h of water permeation ct is the concentration in g l 1 of the salt solution at the end of permeation time and vt is the volume in l of permeated water at the end of permeation time the antifouling property of the best tfn membrane was evaluated in al fs mode using sodium alginate and bovine serum albumin bsa as model foulants solution of 500 ppm sodium alginate or bsa was used as the feed solution during anti fouling test and the changes in water permeability was recorded for a period of 9 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of cn and pcn morphological structure of cn and pcn was characterized using tem and illustrated in fig 1 a and b as shown the structure of cn and pcn resembles that of graphene sheets which is similar to that of reported by niu et al 18 upon the acid modification the stacking of pcn nanosheets has been reduced as compared to cn this can be related to the derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek dlvo theory which mentions about the existence of electrical forces between a double layer and also van der waals forces to stabilize a colloidal system 25 this was also reported by wan azelee et al 4 where the acid treated mwcnt and tnt showed less entanglement within its molecular structure because of the high repulsive forces that presence on its surfaces similar observations have also been made by mudunkotuwa et al who treated tio2 using citric acid 26 fig 1c presents the xrd patterns of cn and pcn there are two characteristic peaks for the formation of these nanomaterials i e the peak at approximately 12 48 that corresponds to the in planar repeated tri s triazine unit and the peak around 28 that represents the interlayer stacking distance d spacing between subsequent cn layers 21 after the protonation process the higher diffraction angle was shifted from 28 d 0 318 nm to 27 42 d 0 325 nm indicating the increasing of d spacing of the planar graphitic interlayer structure 27 29 this happened due to the existence of the positively charge hydrogen in the structure which has extended the distance between the cn nanosheets layers the atr ftir spectra of cn and pcn are shown in fig 1d the peak exists around 802 cm 1 is corresponded to the s triazine ring system 30 the multiple bands or peaks found between 1200 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 are related to the characteristic of c n heterocycle stretches of c n c c and c nh c units 31 the broad peaks occurred between 3000 cm 1 and 3600 cm 1 are due to the nh stretching sharper peaks are observed in pcn due to the higher packing of hydrogen bond 18 the comparison of the spectra suggested that the basic chemical chains of cn were well maintained after the protonation 32 the schematic diagram of the formation of cn and pcn is shown in fig 2 during the synthesis of cn melamine precursor was condensed to form cn through condensation method melamine polymer structure rearranged into carbon nitride at 520 c and formed a diamond like and graphene like structure 33 during the acid treatment the chemical structure and charges of cn were modified by absorbing positively charged hydrogen from hcl according to ong et al 34 cn surface charge could be easily overturned by treating with acid such as hcl the positive charges have in turn increased the repulsive force between the molecular structure the surface charge of cn and pcn was evaluated by measuring the zeta potential it was found that cn showed negative charge 34 6 mv and increased to positive charge 8 3 mv after the acid treatment the change in the surface charges has further verified the successful protonation of cn 3 2 characterization of membrane the surface and cross sectional morphology of the membranes are illustrated in fig 3 the typical cross sectional images of tfc and tfn membrane that consist of pa thin film layer and psf substrate are shown in fig 3 a d from the cross sectional images finger like structure can be observed across the membrane 14 35 36 the average pore diameter and total porosity of psf substrate were 146 85 nm and 74 7 respectively after incorporating pcn average pore diameter reduced to 99 27 nm and its total porosity also decreased to 48 9 the increase in the viscosity of casting solution upon the addition of pcn has lead to the delayed demixing of solvent and non solvent hence denser structures of substrate were formed due to the low loading of both cn and pcn in the substrate and pa layer the nanoparticles cannot be visibly observed from the membrane cross section fig 3a and b show the surface image of tfc and pcn tfn meanwhile fig 3c and d show the surface images of pcn pcn tfn and cn pcn tfn where the pa layer has been embedded with cn and pcn respectively the difference of fig 3c and d compared to that of fig 3a and b implied that the incorporation of cn and pcn has influenced the surface morphology of the membranes fig 3a c show that the ridge and valley structure combined with leaf like structure were observed and showing the typical pa layer structure of the membrane 37 nevertheless the change in the structure of pa layer in fig 3d was probably due to the dispersion of cn it has been reported that the incorporation of nanoparticles within the pa may reduce the contact of mpd and tmc during ip process hence affecting the selectivity of the pa layer 38 three dimensional afm images of the membranes and their average surface roughness ra are shown in fig 4 surface roughness of the tfn membrane was influenced by pa layer that showed a ridge and valley structure which caused by the polymerized film of amine and acyl chloride monomers 4 39 comparison between fig 4a tfc and fig 4b pcn tfn shows that the surface roughness has slightly increased from 34 71 nm to 35 37 nm due to the presence of pcn in the substrates similar observation has also been made by lai et al who embedded go within the substrate 40 this value increased to 36 35 nm and 37 51 nm for pcn pcn tfn and cn pcn tfn respectively atr ftir analysis was performed to confirm the existence of the functional group and molecular bonding as demonstrated in fig 5 the peaks at wavenumber 1503 cm 1 ch3 cch3 stretching 1409 cm 1 cc aromatic ring stretching 1322 cm 1 cn aromatic amine stretching 1294 cm 1 asymmetric oso stretching 1240 cm 1 asymmetric coc stretching and 1150 cm 1 symmetric oso stretching were the typical peaks for psf 28 while the formation of pa layer was evidenced through the peaks at 1610 cm 1 aromatic ring breathing c6h6 1585 cm 1 cn stretching and 1552 cm 1 nh bending 41 the peak observed around 1660 cm 1 due to the primary amide stretching can be attributed to the presence of pvp which was used as pore former 42 table 2 tabulates the contact angle and surface zeta potential of the membranes it was noted that the water contact angles of cn pcn tfn 56 16 2 92 and pcn pcn tfn 59 74 3 19 were drastically lower than that of tfc 88 92 3 24 and pcn tfn 76 11 3 33 this implies that the pa layer containing cn or pcn was more easily wetted by water compared neat pa the elevated affinity of the surfaces of cn pcn tfn and pcn pcn tfn toward water was attributed to the presence of hydrophilic cn and pcn in the pa layer in term of zeta potential analysis the surface of tfc was the most negatively charged 47 3 mv among the fabricated membranes in this study this observation is in agreement with past studies which reported that the surface charge of tfc was in between 40 mv and 60 mv 43 45 upon addition of pcn into the substrate layer the surface of pcn tfn was 11 6 mv less negative than tfc it is believed that the positive charge carried by the pcn within the substrate has contributed to the large drop in negativity of the overall membrane surface charge this effect was also observed in pcn psf where the addition of 0 5 wt pcn resulted in increased surface zeta potential that of neat psf from 20 4 mv to 9 06 mv on the other hand due to the small amount of nanofillers incorporated into the pa layer difference in the surface charges between pcn tfn 35 7 mv and pcn pcn tfn 32 2 mv was relatively insignificant yet in the case of cn pcn tfn the membrane higher surface change 28 2 mv compared to pcn pcn tfn was unexpected theoretically the incorporation of negatively charged cn should have resulted to slightly more negatively charged surface of the cn pcn tfn compared to pcn pcn tfn and pcn tfn it is postulated that this deviation could be associated to the structure of the pa layer which was less dense compared to that of pcn pcn tfn and pcn tfn hence having lower pa content since the negatively charge pa is the primary contributor to the overall surface charge of the membrane lower pa content would lead to slightly higher zeta potential this assumption is in line with the data of ro test where the higher water flux but lower salt rejection of cn pcn tfn compared to other tfns could indicate thinner or less dense pa selective layer according to margarida et al 46 negative ions such as chloride ions in the aqueous solution are repelled by the membrane surface that possessed the same charge thus membrane with negatively charged surface is desired to hamper the permeation of chloride ions across the membrane 3 3 evaluation of desalination performances fig 6 shows the performance of the tfc and tfn membranes in terms of water permeability and salt rejection using ro systems cn pcn tfn membrane exhibited greatly improved water flux when compared to tfc pcn tfn and pcn pcn tfn membrane as mentioned earlier the incorporation of hydrophilic nanoparticles in the substrate and or pa layer increased the pure water flux denser pa layer was formed due to the presence of pcn in the substrate cn pcn tfn membranes exhibited improved water permeability by about 70 0 67 l m2 h bar compared to tfc membrane this improvement was influenced by several factors including surface hydrophilicity surface charge and surface density these factors were explained in detail in the following parts fig 7 shows the fo performances of the membrane prepared fig 7a shows the water flux for all membrane prepared in this study cn pcn tfn exhibited the best performance in both al fs and al ds modes with a result of 6 20 lmh and 9 23 lmh respectively followed by pcn pcn tfn with 3 69 lmh and 9 02 lmh respectively on the other hand tfc membrane only showed water flux of 0 78 lmh for in al fs mode this might be caused by the icp phenomenon which has created a resistance for solute solution to flow within the porous substrates according to lim et al 47 icp is the major factor that leads to low water flux in fo embedding pcn within the substrate seems to be a promising strategy as it increased the hydrophilicity of the membrane and produced higher water flux compared to tfc for pcn tfn the value of water flux in al fs mode increased to 4 24 lmh and it can be deduced that icp has been mitigated 48 the structural parameter calculated in table 3 has further confirmed the suppression of icp the s parameter was reduced from 27 4 mm to 2 96 mm similarly the performances of tfn with either cn or pcn embedded within the pa layer were also improved compared to tfc membrane all the tfn showed higher water flux and lower reverse solute flux in al ds mode due to less severe icp one of the undesired effects of incorporating hydrophilic nanomaterial within the pa layer of tfn was the increase of water flux at the expenses of salt rejection due to the formation of voids at the polymer filler interphase hence in this study one of the main purposes of incorporating pcn within the psf substrate was to introduce positive charge on the substrate in order to improve the interaction between the pa layer and the substrate with better interaction denser layer of pa layer was formed on the substrate to ensure high salt rejection 49 simultaneously the hydrophilic cn and pcn also created additional pathway to facilitate the transport of water molecule this strategy allows the tfn membrane to exhibit high flux and rejection of nacl solution in term of salt rejection tfc and pcn tfn exhibited salt rejection that was above 98 which suggested that the pa layer was almost intact despite the incorporation of nanomaterials within the layer on the other hand slight decrease in the rejection was observed for pcn pcn tfn and cn pcn tfn however these tfn membrane still exhibited nacl rejection that was comparable to that of commercial ro membrane the surface charge that carried by pcn and cn has helped in rejecting the salt from permeating through as illustrated in fig 8 cl co ions were repelled from the negatively charged surface whereas the na counterions were attracted to the surface and become more dominant at the water membrane interface however the counterions could not firmly attach on the negatively charged surface due to brownian motion effect as a result the accumulated na counterions has re established the electroneutrality at the region sufficiently distant away from the membrane surface 50 consequently both na and cl ions can be effectively rejected by the charged surfaces fig 9 depicted the changes in water flux of cn pcn tfn and tfc in the presence of sodium alginate or bsa foulant when sodium alginate was introduced as polysaccharide based foulant at the feed the water flux of tfc begun to decline after 2 h operation while cn pcn tfn was able to retain its original water flux two times longer than the former after 9 h continuous operation the water flux of tfc declined 8 6 whereas the water flux of cn pcn tfn only declined 4 0 similar trend was also observed when bsa was used as protein based foulant however both tfc and cn pcn tfn were less susceptible to bsa fouling the water flux of cn pcn tfn was unchanged throughout the 9 h testing period whereas tfc begun to be fouled by bsa after 7 5 h these observations suggested that cn pcn tfn exhibited better anti fouling property compared to tfc table 4 tabulates the performance reported in the previous and current studies pan et al 15 embedded imogolite nanotubes ints in the psf substrate to improve the hydrophilicity thus increase the water permeability from 1 96 lmhbar to 2 33 lmhbar although the improvement in salt rejection was observed the salt rejection was still below 90 pardeshi et al 52 incorporated layered double hydroxide nanoparticles ldh within the substrates to improve the water permeability the water permeability increased but their nacl rejection has been compromised other than that m amini et al 53 incorporated functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotube in the pa layer to have a better membrane performance with only 0 05 of f mwcnts their salt rejection and water permeability were improved significantly in this work embedding 0 5 wt pcn in the psf substrate has resulted in the increase in water flux without much compromising the salt rejection based on the comparisons it is clear that there are still rooms of improvement for the membrane developed in this study however this work has explored the potential of cn to alter the properties of fo membrane for desalination by tailoring the charges of the substrate and pa layer through the incorporation of cn and pcn with desired surface charges the membrane performance can be improved 4 conclusions in this study the benefits of using pcn and cn in tailoring the surface properties of pa layer and intrinsic properties of substrate have been evidenced and discussed based on the performance of the membrane fabricated tfc and pcn tfn showed above 98 for salt rejection nacl with water permeability of 0 4 lmh bar 1 and 0 39 lmh bar 1 respectively when the pcn pcn tfn and cn pcn tfn were tested for water permeability and salt rejection it showed a great performance for ro membranes pcn cn tfn recorded about 0 45 lmh bar 1 with 95 7 salt rejection while cn pcn tfn improved the water permeability to 0 67 lmh bar 1 and 94 5 salt rejection it is an ultimate target in membrane based desalination to improve water productivity without significantly sacrificing the salt rejection in term of performance in fo configuration tfns embedded with the hydrophilic nanomaterials exhibited enhanced water flux with better icp resistance compared to tfc hence the cn pcn tfn

14141,thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes incorporated with carbon nitride cn or protonated cn pcn were fabricated for forward osmosis fo desalination the cn and pcn were incorporated within the polyamide pa layer which was supported by pcn incorporated polysulfone psf substrate to form the tfn membrane it was found that the presence of pcn in the substrate has favourably altered the intrinsic properties and affected the formation of pa layer the physico chemical characterizations indicated that the presence of both cn and pcn enhanced the surface hydrophilicity but reduced the surface negativity of the pa layer these features have resulted in the improved water transport and salt rejective ability as a result cn pcn tfn membranes exhibited improved water permeability by about 70 0 67 l m2 h bar compared to tfc membrane while maintaining salt rejection of 94 5 cn pcn tfn also exhibited better anti fouling property compared to tfc in which the flux decline was only half of that of tfc membrane during the 9 h antifouling test this work demonstrates the feasibility of using functional cn and pcn to independently tailor the substrate and pa layer properties of the tfn membrane hence improving the desalination performances of the membrane keywords carbon nitride reverse osmosis forward osmosis thin film nanocomposite 1 introduction human population in the world has reached 7 billion in 2015 and the number keeps increasing with nearly 250 thousand added daily the population is expected to reach 9 7 billion by 2050 1 the major issue that accompanies the exponentially growth population is the shortage of fresh water supply as reported by united nations world water development in 2015 780 million people did not have access to safe drinking water and this number is expected to raise in the coming years 2 3 numerous alternatives have been considered to address this global challenge desalination is one of the most promising methods to recover fresh water supply considering the amount of seawater that exist and the limited resources of fresh water available 4 6 forward osmosis fo has attracted attention in the desalination community due to its desirable features for sustainable desalination process 7 by carefully selecting an appropriate draw solution and a regeneration approach that requires low energy consumption fo holds great potential as an alternative to commercially used ro 8 currently the main obstacle that limits the performance of fo is the internal concentration polarization icp 9 icp is a phenomenon resulted from the accumulation of solutes inside of the pore of the membrane which in turn changes the effective osmotic pressure that act as driving force 10 thin film composite tfc membrane has been widely used for fo desalination owing to its high salt rejection and water flux typically tfc comprises of a polyamide pa layer which is fabricated on top of a polymeric substrate through an interfacial polymerization ip process 4 11 over the last decade the advancement made in nanoscience and materials has provided unprecedented means to address the underlying issues related to the limitations of tfc membranes the incorporation of various functional nanomaterials in thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes has rendered some attractive features to strengthen the membrane properties such as anti fouling membrane morphology and most importantly the performance the first attempt of making such effort can be dated back to 2007 where nanoparticles such as zeolite and carbon nanotubes cnt were introduced to improve the mechanical chemical thermal and separation behaviour of the membrane 12 recently graphene based nanomaterials and metal oxide framework mof have been the subjects of focus as they are known to provide high permeability and selectivity to the resultant tfn hence greatly reduce the energy consumption in filtration while maintaining high recovery 13 the incorporation of nanomaterials with super hydrophilic properties and negative surface charges is able to improve the anti fouling performance and permeability without sacrificing the superior salt rejection 14 as reported by pan et al 15 blending of imogolite nanotubes into the psf substrates has significantly improved the hydrophilicity water flux porosity and roughness of the membrane surface ghanbari et al who reported the blending of hnt within psf substrates have also observed enhancement in the water permeability due to increase in hydrophilicity and porosity of the resultant tfn compared to the tfc membrane 10 additionally emadzadeh et al reported that the embedment of titanate nanotubes nh2 tnts in pa layer has improved the tfn salt rejection by 2 and water flux by almost two folds compared to that of tfc 16 recently graphitic carbon nitride cn has attracted attention in various applications 17 cn forms graphene like nanosheets structure and has a diamond like mechanical properties 18 19 cn can be used as metal free photocatalyst for the degradation of organic pollutions owing to its special optical feature high thermal stability and chemical stability 20 according to wang et al cn has the potential to enhance wettability of composite substrate through the interaction of hydrogen bonding of water molecules with the nitrogen atoms of cn 21 surface modification of nanomaterials is a common strategy to further enhance the functionality or to improve the dispersibility of the nanomaterials when incorporated into polymeric matrix one of the easiest ways to introduce functional groups to the surface of nanomaterials is through acid modification oxidation of the nanomaterials by acid treatment improves the dispersion of the nanomaterials through the generation of hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups on the nanomaterials structure 22 wan azelee et al 4 improved the dispersion of multiwalled carbon nanotube and titania nanotube mwcnt tnt hybrid in tmc solution by treating the nanomaterials with sulphuric acid the embedment of this acid treated hybrid into the pa layer has rendered negative charges and allowed better interaction between the water molecule and the selective layer to produce a highly permeable tfn without compromising the selectivity in this study cn was treated with acid to modify the surface charges and functionalities of the nanomaterials this protonated cn pcn was then dispersed into psf dope solution to fabricate nanocomposite substrate additionally tfns containing cn or pcn within the selective layer have also been fabricated the resultant membranes were subjected to various characterizations to investigate the effects of cn and pcn towards the physico chemical properties of the tfn membranes finally the desalination performance was evaluated in terms of the flux and selectivity in ro and fo system this work represents the first attempt of using cn and pcn to fabricate tfn membrane hence it may provide new insights into the potentials of these nanomaterials in enhancing the performance of tfn for desalination 2 experimental 2 1 materials polysulfone udels p 3500 lcd mb3 polymer supplied in a form of pellets by solvay was used to prepare neat psf supports polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp k29 32 and 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidinone nmp 99 5 obtained from acros organic were used as pore forming agent and solvent respectively to develop psf supports m phenylenediamine mpd 99 and 1 3 5 benzenetricarbonyl trichloride tmc 98 from acros organic were used to prepare tfc membranes i e using psf as supports sodium chloride nacl 99 5 provided by rcl labscan and n hexane c6h6 49 were supplied by merck while hydrochloric acid hcl 65 wt was obtained from merck melamine was supplied by sigma aldrich 2 2 synthesis of carbon nitride and acid treatment melamine precursors were used to synthesize cn through a thermal polycondensation method 23 in a typical procedure 15 g of melamine powder was filled into an alumina crucible with lid next the crucible was heated to 550 c in air condition using carbolite muffle furnace with a heating rate of 5 c min the furnace temperature was maintained at 550 c for 2 h before the heating element was turned off to allow the furnace to cool naturally after the setup was cooled to room temperature the resulted yellow product was collected and ground into a powder with a ceramic mortar for a further use for the synthesis of pcn 10 ml of 5 m hydrochloric acid was mixed with each gram of cn used the suspension was then stirred overnight followed by filtration and washing with deionised water to neutralize the product lastly the pale yellow powder was ground and dried overnight at 100 c under vacuum condition 2 3 preparation of polysulfone psf support membrane phase inversion technique was used to fabricate psf substrates 24 the dope solution to produce neat psf substrates was prepared by dissolving 17 5 wt psf and 0 5 wt pvp in nmp the dope solution was stirred for 24 h to ensure proper dissolution of psf pellets and homogeneous dispersion of pcn after that the dope solution was degassed via sonication in a room temperature for 1 to 2 h the degassed dope solution was casted onto a clean glass plate using a glass rod then immediately immersed into a coagulation bath containing deionised di water after 2 min the solidified psf sheet was peeled from the glass plate transferred into a second di water bath and kept overnight to ensure that remnant solvent within the psf substrate was removed for the preparation of pcn incorporated psf substrate pcn psf the same procedure for preparing neat psf was used except 0 5 wt of pcn was added into the dope solution 2 4 preparation of thin film composite and thin film nanocomposite membranes pa active layer was formed on top of the psf substrate via ip method using 2 w v of mpd in deionised water and 0 1 w v tmc in n hexane first the substrate membrane was fixed in between a glass plate and a rubber frame then the mpd solution was poured into the setup to saturate the exposed side of psf with the diamine monomer after 1 min excess mpd solution was drained off and the leftover droplets were remove using a rubber roller next tmc solution was dripped onto the mpd saturated surface to initiate the ip process after 50 s excess tmc solution was poured out and the resulted tfc was left to dry in ambient temperature for 1 min before thermally treated in oven at 60 c for 5 min lastly the membrane was stored in di water for 24 h before further use for the fabrication of tfn membrane 0 05 w v

study are tabulated in table 1 2 5 characterization of nanomaterials and membranes the morphology of cn and pcn was examined using transmission electron microscopy tem ht 770 hitachi japan for this purpose small amount of the powdered sample was dispersed in water via 1 h sonication after standing for 10 min the supernatant of the suspension solution was drawn out using a clean pipette then dropped onto a copper grid to deposit the nanomaterials on the grid the loaded copper grid was dried in oven at 60 c for 10 min before analysis x ray diffraction spectroscopy xrd cu kα radiation λ 0

scanning was carried out at 2θ between 4 and 70 the functional groups of cn and pcn were identified via fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo nicolet avatar 360 the sample was mixed with kbr powder via grinding for 2 min then the homogenized powder was compressed into a thin pellet using a stainless steel die the pellet was loaded into the sample holder and the ftir scanning was carried out at wavenumber between 400 cm 1 and 4000 cm 1 to determine the surface charge surface zeta potential malvern zetasizer nano zs was used the sample were prepared by using deionized water as a medium ph neutral at room temperature and with dispersant dielectric constant of 78 5 for membrane sample average pore diameter and porosity of the psf and pcn psf substrate were determined by using mercury porosimeter microactive autopore v 9600 micromeritics instrument corp ftir was conducted in attenuated total reflectance mode atr ftir by switching the pellet holder of the spectrometer into atr accessories membrane sample was cut into strips then clamped on the atr probe and scanned at wavenumber between 600 cm 1 and 4000 cm 1 other than that the morphological structure of the membrane

2 6 evaluation of membrane performances dead end filtration system was used to measure ro performance that was made of stainless steel 316 model hp4750 stirred cell sterlitech corp kent wa the membrane active surface area am was 14 6 cm2 2 26 in2 firstly the membrane was stabilized at 16 bar for 30 min with ro water to compact the structure of the membrane then the feed pressure δp in bar was adjusted to 15 bar and the rate of water permeated through the membrane q in l h 1 was measured based on the results the water permeability was calculated using the equation below water permeability l m 2 h 1 b a r 1 or lmh bar 1 q a m δp next the content of the filtration cell was replaced with nacl solution 2000 ppm for further testing the conductivity of the permeated solution was measured using jenway conductivity meter model 4520 since conductivity is linearly correlated to the concentration of the salt solution the salt rejection was determined based the equation below salt rejection 1 c p c f 100 where cp is the conductivity of permeate solution and cf is the conductivity of feed solution other than that filtration performance of the membrane in two fo modes i e active layer facing feed solution al fs and active layer facing draw solution al ds were also tested for this experiment ptfe cell cf016p fo cell with am of 20 6 cm2 3 2 inch2 which was supplied by sterlitech corp was used the draw solution consisted of 2 mol l 1 nacl while distilled water was used as the feed solution respectively prior to variables measurement membrane sample was first stabilized for 30 min after that the changes in the weight of draw solution and the conductivity of feed solution were monitored and recorded for every 30 min test using digital weighing balance model gx 12 k a d company limited toshima ku tokyo and portable conductivity meter model pro30 ysi yellow springs oh respectively 3 4 consistent readings were taken to compute the average water flux j v in lmh and reverse solute flux j s in gmh the following equations were used for the calculation of j v and j s respectively j v δm δt a m ρ h 2 o j s δ c t v t δt a m where ρ h 2 o is the density in g l 1 of water while δt is the duration in h of water permeation ct is the concentration in g l 1 of the salt solution at the end of permeation time and vt is the volume in l of permeated water at the end of permeation time the antifouling property of the best tfn membrane was evaluated in al fs mode using sodium alginate and bovine serum albumin bsa as model foulants solution of 500 ppm sodium alginate or bsa was used as the feed solution during anti fouling test and the changes in water permeability was recorded for a period of 9 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of cn and pcn morphological structure of cn and pcn was characterized using tem and illustrated in fig 1 a and b as shown the structure of cn and pcn resembles that of graphene sheets which is similar to that of reported by niu et al 18 upon the acid modification the stacking of pcn nanosheets has been reduced as compared to cn this can be related to the derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek dlvo theory which mentions about the existence of electrical forces between a double layer and also van der waals forces to stabilize a colloidal system 25 this was also reported by wan azelee et al 4 where the acid treated mwcnt and tnt showed less entanglement within its molecular structure because of the high repulsive forces that presence on its surfaces similar observations have also been made by mudunkotuwa et al who treated tio2 using citric acid 26 fig 1c presents the xrd patterns of cn and pcn there are two characteristic peaks for the formation of these nanomaterials i e the peak at approximately 12 48 that corresponds to the in planar repeated tri s triazine unit and the peak around 28 that represents the interlayer stacking distance d spacing between subsequent cn layers 21 after the protonation process the higher diffraction angle was shifted from 28 d 0 318 nm to 27 42 d 0 325 nm indicating the increasing of d spacing of the planar graphitic interlayer structure 27 29 this happened due to the existence of the positively charge hydrogen in the structure which has extended the distance between the cn nanosheets layers the atr ftir spectra of cn and pcn are shown in fig 1d the peak exists around 802 cm 1 is corresponded to the s triazine ring system 30 the multiple bands or peaks found between 1200 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 are related to the characteristic of c n heterocycle stretches of c n c c and c nh c units 31 the broad peaks occurred between 3000 cm 1 and 3600 cm 1 are due to the nh stretching sharper peaks are observed in pcn due to the higher packing of hydrogen bond 18 the comparison of the spectra suggested that the basic chemical chains of cn were well maintained after the protonation 32 the schematic diagram of the formation of cn and pcn is shown in fig 2 during the synthesis of cn melamine precursor was condensed to form cn through condensation method melamine polymer structure rearranged into carbon nitride at 520 c and formed a diamond like and graphene like structure 33 during the acid treatment the chemical structure and charges of cn were modified by absorbing positively charged hydrogen from hcl according to ong et al 34 cn surface charge could be easily overturned by treating with acid such as hcl the positive charges have in turn increased the repulsive force between the molecular structure the surface charge of cn and pcn was evaluated by measuring the zeta potential it was found that cn showed negative charge 34 6 mv and increased to positive charge 8 3 mv after the acid treatment the change in the surface charges has further verified the successful protonation of cn 3 2 characterization of membrane the surface and cross sectional morphology of the membranes are illustrated in fig 3 the typical cross sectional images of tfc and tfn membrane that consist of pa thin film layer and psf substrate are shown in fig 3 a d from the cross sectional images finger like structure can be observed across the membrane 14 35 36 the average pore diameter and total porosity of psf substrate were 146 85 nm and 74 7 respectively after incorporating pcn average pore diameter reduced to 99 27 nm and its total porosity also decreased to 48 9 the increase in the viscosity of casting solution upon the addition of pcn has lead to the delayed demixing of solvent and non solvent hence denser structures of substrate were formed due to the low loading of both cn and pcn in the substrate and pa layer the nanoparticles cannot be visibly observed from the membrane cross section fig 3a and b show the surface image of tfc and pcn tfn meanwhile fig 3c and d show the surface images of pcn pcn tfn and cn pcn tfn where the pa layer has been embedded with cn and pcn respectively the difference of fig 3c and d compared to that of fig 3a and b implied that the incorporation of cn and pcn has influenced the surface morphology of the membranes fig 3a c show that the ridge and valley structure combined with leaf like structure were observed and showing the typical pa layer structure of the membrane 37 nevertheless the change in the structure of pa layer in fig 3d was probably due to the dispersion of cn it has been reported that the incorporation of nanoparticles within the pa may reduce the contact of mpd and tmc during ip process hence affecting the selectivity of the pa layer 38 three dimensional afm images of the membranes and their average surface roughness ra are shown in fig 4 surface roughness of the tfn membrane was influenced by pa layer that showed a ridge and valley structure which caused by the polymerized film of amine and acyl chloride monomers 4 39 comparison between fig 4a tfc and fig 4b pcn tfn shows that the surface roughness has slightly increased from 34 71 nm to 35 37 nm due to the presence of pcn in the substrates similar observation has also been made by lai et al who embedded go within the substrate 40 this value increased to 36 35 nm and 37 51 nm for pcn pcn tfn and cn pcn tfn respectively atr ftir analysis was performed to confirm the existence of the functional group and molecular bonding as demonstrated in fig 5 the peaks at wavenumber 1503 cm 1 ch3 cch3 stretching 1409 cm 1 cc aromatic ring stretching 1322 cm 1 cn aromatic amine stretching 1294 cm 1 asymmetric oso stretching 1240 cm 1 asymmetric coc stretching and 1150 cm 1 symmetric oso stretching were the typical peaks for psf 28 while the formation of pa layer was evidenced through the peaks at 1610 cm 1 aromatic ring breathing c6h6 1585 cm 1 cn stretching and 1552 cm 1 nh bending 41 the peak observed around 1660 cm 1 due to the primary amide stretching can be attributed to the presence of pvp which was used as pore former 42 table 2 tabulates the contact angle and surface zeta potential of the membranes it was noted that the water contact angles of cn pcn tfn 56 16 2 92 and pcn pcn tfn 59 74 3 19 were drastically lower than that of tfc 88 92 3 24 and pcn tfn 76 11 3 33 this implies that the pa layer containing cn or pcn was more easily wetted by water compared neat pa the elevated affinity of the surfaces of cn pcn tfn and pcn pcn tfn toward water was attributed to the presence of hydrophilic cn and pcn in the pa layer in term of zeta potential analysis the surface of tfc was the most negatively charged 47 3 mv among the fabricated membranes in this study this observation is in agreement with past studies which reported that the surface charge of tfc was in between 40 mv and 60 mv 43 45 upon addition of pcn into the substrate layer the surface of pcn tfn was 11 6 mv less negative than tfc it is believed that the positive charge carried by the pcn within the substrate has contributed to the large drop in negativity of the overall membrane surface charge this effect was also observed in pcn psf where the addition of 0 5 wt pcn resulted in increased surface zeta potential that of neat psf from 20 4 mv to 9 06 mv on the other hand due to the small amount of nanofillers incorporated into the pa layer difference in the surface charges between pcn tfn 35 7 mv and pcn pcn tfn 32 2 mv was relatively insignificant yet in the case of cn pcn tfn the membrane higher surface change 28 2 mv compared to pcn pcn tfn was unexpected theoretically the incorporation of negatively charged cn should have resulted to slightly more negatively charged surface of the cn pcn tfn compared to pcn pcn tfn and pcn tfn it is postulated that this deviation could be associated to the structure of the pa layer which was less dense compared to that of pcn pcn tfn and pcn tfn hence having lower pa content since the negatively charge pa is the primary contributor to the overall surface charge of the membrane lower pa content would lead to slightly higher zeta potential this assumption is in line with the data of ro test where the higher water flux but lower salt rejection of cn pcn tfn compared to other tfns could indicate thinner or less dense pa selective layer according to margarida et al 46 negative ions such as chloride ions in the aqueous solution are repelled by the membrane surface that possessed the same charge thus membrane with negatively charged surface is desired to hamper the permeation of chloride ions across the membrane 3 3 evaluation of desalination performances fig 6 shows the performance of the tfc and tfn membranes in terms of water permeability and salt rejection using ro systems cn pcn tfn membrane exhibited greatly improved water flux when compared to tfc pcn tfn and pcn pcn tfn membrane as mentioned earlier the incorporation of hydrophilic nanoparticles in the substrate and or pa layer increased the pure water flux denser pa layer was formed due to the presence of pcn in the substrate cn pcn tfn membranes exhibited improved water permeability by about 70 0 67 l m2 h bar compared to tfc membrane this improvement was influenced by several factors including surface hydrophilicity surface charge and surface density these factors were explained in detail in the following parts fig 7 shows the fo performances of the membrane prepared fig 7a shows the water flux for all membrane prepared in this study cn pcn tfn exhibited the best performance in both al fs and al ds modes with a result of 6 20 lmh and 9 23 lmh respectively followed by pcn pcn tfn with 3 69 lmh and 9 02 lmh respectively on the other hand tfc membrane only showed water flux of 0 78 lmh for in al fs mode this might be caused by the icp phenomenon which has created a resistance for solute solution to flow within the porous substrates according to lim et al 47 icp is the major factor that leads to low water flux in fo embedding pcn within the substrate seems to be a promising strategy as it increased the hydrophilicity of the membrane and produced higher water flux compared to tfc for pcn tfn the value of water flux in al fs mode increased to 4 24 lmh and it can be deduced that icp has been mitigated 48 the structural parameter calculated in table 3 has further confirmed the suppression of icp the s parameter was reduced from 27 4 mm to 2 96 mm similarly the performances of tfn with either cn or pcn embedded within the pa layer were also improved compared to tfc membrane all the tfn showed higher water flux and lower reverse solute flux in al ds mode due to less severe icp one of the undesired effects of incorporating hydrophilic nanomaterial within the pa layer of tfn was the increase of water flux at the expenses of salt rejection due to the formation of voids at the polymer filler interphase hence in this study one of the main purposes of incorporating pcn within the psf substrate was to introduce positive charge on the substrate in order to improve the interaction between the pa layer and the substrate with better interaction denser layer of pa layer was formed on the substrate to ensure high salt rejection 49 simultaneously the hydrophilic cn and pcn also created additional pathway to facilitate the transport of water molecule this strategy allows the tfn membrane to exhibit high flux and rejection of nacl solution in term of salt rejection tfc and pcn tfn exhibited salt rejection that was above 98 which suggested that the pa layer was almost intact despite the incorporation of nanomaterials within the layer on the other hand slight decrease in the rejection was observed for pcn pcn tfn and cn pcn tfn however these tfn membrane still exhibited nacl rejection that was comparable to that of commercial ro membrane the surface charge that carried by pcn and cn has helped in rejecting the salt from permeating through as illustrated in fig 8 cl co ions were repelled from the negatively charged surface whereas the na counterions were attracted to the surface and become more dominant at the water membrane interface however the counterions could not firmly attach on the negatively charged surface due to brownian motion effect as a result the accumulated na counterions has re established the electroneutrality at the region sufficiently distant away from the membrane surface 50 consequently both na and cl ions can be effectively rejected by the charged surfaces fig 9 depicted the changes in water flux of cn pcn tfn and tfc in the presence of sodium alginate or bsa foulant when sodium alginate was introduced as polysaccharide based foulant at the feed the water flux of tfc begun to decline after 2 h operation while cn pcn tfn was able to retain its original water flux two times longer than the former after 9 h continuous operation the water flux of tfc declined 8 6 whereas the water flux of cn pcn tfn only declined 4 0 similar trend was also observed when bsa was used as protein based foulant however both tfc and cn pcn tfn were less susceptible to bsa fouling the water flux of cn pcn tfn was unchanged throughout the 9 h testing period whereas tfc begun to be fouled by bsa after 7 5 h these observations suggested that cn pcn tfn exhibited better anti fouling property compared to tfc table 4 tabulates the performance reported in the previous and current studies pan et al 15 embedded imogolite nanotubes ints in the psf substrate to improve the hydrophilicity thus increase the water permeability from 1 96 lmhbar to 2 33 lmhbar although the improvement in salt rejection was observed the salt rejection was still below 90 pardeshi et al 52 incorporated layered double hydroxide nanoparticles ldh within the substrates to improve the water permeability the water permeability increased but their nacl rejection has been compromised other than that m amini et al 53 incorporated functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotube in the pa layer to have a better membrane performance with only 0 05 of f mwcnts their salt rejection and water permeability were improved significantly in this work embedding 0 5 wt pcn in the psf substrate has resulted in the increase in water flux without much compromising the salt rejection based on the comparisons it is clear that there are still rooms of improvement for the membrane developed in this study however this work has explored the potential of cn to alter the properties of fo membrane for desalination by tailoring the charges of the substrate and pa layer through the incorporation of cn and pcn with desired surface charges the membrane performance can be improved 4 conclusions in this study the benefits of using pcn and cn in tailoring the surface properties of pa layer and intrinsic properties of substrate have been evidenced and discussed based on the performance of the membrane fabricated tfc and pcn tfn showed above 98 for salt rejection nacl with water permeability of 0 4 lmh bar 1 and 0 39 lmh bar 1 respectively when the pcn pcn tfn and cn pcn tfn were tested for water permeability and salt rejection it showed a great performance for ro membranes pcn cn tfn recorded about 0 45 lmh bar 1 with 95 7 salt rejection while cn pcn tfn improved the water permeability to 0 67 lmh bar 1 and 94 5 salt rejection it is an ultimate target in membrane based desalination to improve water productivity without significantly sacrificing the salt rejection in term of performance in fo configuration tfns embedded with the hydrophilic nanomaterials exhibited enhanced water flux with better icp resistance compared to tfc hence the cn pcn tfn developed in this study holds potentials to be further optimized for improving the desalination performance all authors have participated in a conception and design or analysis and interpretation of

14142,the search for novel and cost effective material for water treatment is one of the ongoing challenges among the various new materials carbon based nanostructured materials cnms are considered to be the most robust and versatile candidate for the effective treatment of water carbon nanotubes cnts graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo have enticed wide attention and these materials can be used in a variety of applications due to its superior physio chemical properties the cnms and their composites have been employed to develop unique adsorbents novel catalytic materials and high performance membranes with superior permeation properties for the removal of unwanted species from waste water this review article presents a critical assessment of the existing literature on cnts go

oxide reduced graphene oxide adsorption catalytic degradation membrane separation pollutant removal wastewater treatment 1 introduction fresh water is one of the essential requirements for humanity to sustain life on earth in the recent era contemporary lifestyle demands a higher quantity of freshwater to maintain the standards of living and the increased material consumption produces a large quantity of wastewater which increasingly pollutes the existing fresh water sources in arid and semiarid parts of the world there is a scarcity of water for drinking as well as for agricultural purposes and continued exploitation of non rechargeable water sources creates high environmental stress the progress in membrane technology especially reverse osmosis ro enables to produce a large quantity of freshwater by desalinating the saline water however the population growth and industrial development demand more freshwater requirement or wastewater treatment for beneficial use 1 new technological progress like fracking in oil gas industries requires a large volume of freshwater and subsequent discharge of effluents causing serious threats to the environment 2 thus there is an urgent need of remedying the polluted water thereby solving the environmental concern as well as obtaining the treated water for the possible beneficial use in general the industrial effluent typically contains toxic contaminants such as heavy metals including radioactive elements and synthetic organic compounds such as dyes pharmaceutical derivatives etc 3 5 the heavy metal contaminants are defined as metals having a density greater than 5 g cm3 4 arsenic as cadmium cd chromium cr lead pb and mercury hg are some of the common heavy metals found in the effluent from different industries 6 heavy metal ions are highly soluble in water and if ingested beyond the admissible concentration it may accumulate in the human body resulting in serious health issues which can also lead to fatalities 7 8 another serious source of water pollution is radioactive waste originated from various nuclear reactors and medical facilities around the world 9 the effluent of dye industries is another source of contaminants which are carcinogenic mutagenic or teratogenic 10 11 the metal ions radio nuclei and to some extent dye molecules are persistent therefore these compounds must be removed treated from the effluent before discharging into the environment or for the beneficial use a number of treatment processes are used to remove these harmful species from the effluent water before discharge or beneficial reuse for example adsorption chemical precipitation electrochemical treatment ion exchange membrane separation chlorination and ozonation etc are some of the commonly used methods to remove hazardous materials 6 fig 1 illustrates some of the conventional water treatment technologies and their shortcomings conventional tertiary treatment methods like thermal distillation and reverse osmosis ro are energy intensive processes consequently has high utility operating cost which makes it relatively expensive for widespread usage precipitation and biological treatment can be a simple option for certain water decontamination but it also produces a considerable amount of byproduct namely sludge hence additional sludge disposal process is required the other processes such as chlorination flocculation and coagulation require the addition of chemicals and may produce toxic byproducts 12 the adsorption and membrane technology for water treatment had its concerns about regeneration and fouling in most cases water treatment involves more than one process and the best combination of processes are utilized according to the requirement the need for more than one treatment process is due to the lack of universal technology or economic viability for example wastewater has been effectively treated by reverse osmosis ro process using membranes which should be properly regenerated otherwise membrane fouling happens and the treatment process becomes economically unviable thus it is highly desirable to introduce novel and economic materials for the treatment of newer and intrinsically complex wastewater like produced water 2 the discovery and development of new carbon nanostructured materials cnms can provide a solution to improve these shortcomings 12 the cnms can be described as different allotropes of carbon and comprises of fullerene carbon nanotubes cnts graphene and diamond these are the allotropic forms of carbon in zero one two and three dimensional materials in general cnms have highly robust properties such as high surface area to volume ratio higher adsorption rate superior mechanical strength unique optoelectrical property and small footprints 12 14 consequently cnms materials are extensively studied in the field of adsorption catalysis membrane and composite synthesis sensors electronics energy generation and storage solar and fuel cells etc fig 2 illustrates some of the main applications of cnms due to its unique physio chemical properties cnts graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo are considered as a promising and robust material for wastewater treatment these cnms materials and their composites were widely studied in adsorption catalysis and membrane technology for the removal of organic pollutants and other hazardous contaminants from wastewater effectively 12 15 carbon based materials have also been effectively employed for the treatment of saline water and heavy metals removal in the presence of electric filed through capacitive deionization cdi process generally cdi is a technique implied for separating the charged ions and or hazardous contaminants heavy metals from aqueous solution in the presence of electric field using anode and cathode by applying the potential difference charged ions move in the reverse direction i e anions negatively charged ions travel towards anode positive electrode and cations travel towards cathode hence as a result heavy metals and or na cl ions can be effectively removed from waste and saline water respectively various reports has been published for the preparation of cdi electrodes using go zro2 16 rgo fe3o4 17 cnts sponges 18 activated carbon ac 19 ac fe3o4 nanocomposites 20 as cdi electrodes for waste saline water treatment oladunni et al 21 presented a detailed overview of carbon based cdi electrodes owing to its distinctive properties and thereby diverse applications cnms is one of the actively studied research fields in the last two decades there are review articles available in the literature on heavy metals removal by adsorption using cnt 4 22 and go rgo 23 as a standalone treatment process 24 in addition to this some review articles are also available on cnt and go as catalysis 25 and membrane technology for water treatment 26 27 to the best of our knowledge there is no review article that collectively deals all together with adsorption catalysis and membrane separation for the removal of organic and inorganic contaminants from wastewater using cnts go and rgo in this review the recent advancement in cnms for wastewater treatment is discussed in the field of adsorption catalysis and membrane separation this review also addresses the challenges limitations and future aspects of cnts go and rgo for the feasibility of large scale application in water and wastewater treatment industry though other materials can be included in cnms like biochar carbon dot etc this review restricts to the materials mentioned above due to the limited space to focus more extensively on the published literature reports 2 fundamental aspects of cnms 2 1 carbon nanotubes cnts carbon nanotube cnt is one of the allotropic forms of elemental carbon and its structural form can be considered as elongated fullerenes into the tubular form 14 28 it has a diameter of few nanometers and length of several micrometers and hence called as a nanotube due to its superior mechanical strength and stiffness cnts can be synthesized with the highest length to diameter ratio of 132 000 000 1 which is highest compared to any other material reported 29 in cnts the sp2 hybridized carbon atoms are arranged in a hexagonal pattern similar to that of graphite and exist as a closed cylindrical shape cnts exhibit open end as well as closed end with fullerene caps 30 based on the number of carbon layers cnts can be classified into three main categories namely single walled carbon nanotubes swcnt double walled carbon nanotubes dwcnt and multi walled carbon nanotube mwcnt the morphological aspect of swcnt depicts that it consists of single layer carbon with few nanometer diameter ranges and is relatively curved swcnts exists in metallic and nonmetallic nature therefore they are expected to be useful in miniaturizing electronic devices 31 the dwcnt consists of two carbon layers and shows more chemical resistivity as compared to swcnt the third type is mwcnts which are widely used due to its simplification of the synthesis mwcnts comprise more than two carbon layers having an outer diameter of 3 30 nm and resembles like a concentric tube the morphological structure of single and multi walled cnts are presented in fig 3 cnts are typically synthesized by four leading methods namely laser ablation arc discharge chemical vapor deposition cvd and high pressure carbon monoxide hipco process 32 among these processes cvd and hipco are the most widely used methods for large scale production of cnts however the development of new process and improvements in the existing methods are still in progress for producing cnts socioeconomically on the commercial scale with high purity the fundamental phenomenon operating conditions advantages and disadvantages of these production methods were discussed in the literature 33 due to nanometer scale size the cnts possess unique physio chemical properties such as high aspect ratio large surface area and unique optoelectrical properties cnt and its composites have been effectively used in various applications like energy storage water treatment catalysis electronics biomedical devices food industry and agriculture sector 34 the detailed insight will be discussed in later sections involving separation of toxic pollutants from water using cnts and its composite materials via adsorption catalytic degradation and membrane separation process 2 2 graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo go rgo is a two dimensional 2d nanomaterial of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb structure in go different oxygen based functional groups like carboxyl carbonyl epoxy and hydroxyl are attached to the edges of the go layer resulted in an improved interlayer spacing and hydrophilicity 24 35 on the other hand the oxygenated functional groups of go can be reduced by different chemicals such as hydrazine sodium borohydrate etc and resulted in reduced graphene oxides rgo similar to graphene like sheets exhibiting higher surface area with enhanced adsorption and catalytic active sites fig 4 shows the typical structural illustration and sem images of graphite go and rgo due to ideal plate like structure graphene possesses excellent electrical and thermal conductivity high mechanical strength and consequently considered as a next generation material in electronic devices water treatment and in the energy sector 36 graphene can be prepared by different processes such as mechanical exfoliation chemical reduction of go chemical vapor deposition cvd plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition pecvd and thermal decomposition of organic compounds on selective substrates 37 the large scale preparation of ideal single layer graphene without defects is an ongoing challenge and the synthesis of go and reduced go has progressed tremendously in the last few years the most widely used method for go synthesis is wet chemical oxidation of graphite using strong oxidizing agents like kmno4 though it is cumbersome to clean the residual oxidizing mixture in the go solution this synthetic procedure provides the opportunity to scale up more than a kilogram scale in the laboratory the wet chemical synthesis of go is an economically viable process compared to the preparation of single layer graphene additionally the chemical functional groups present in the go provide further opportunity to modify the existing material according to the requirements therefore more literature reports deal with the applications of go and rgo than single layer pure graphene for water treatment the detailed literature regarding the cnt and graphene synthesis and characterization can be found in the report 32 the following sections present a comprehensive discussion on the application of go rgo as adsorbent catalysts and membrane materials for water treatment 3 adsorption using cnms 3 1 adsorption mechanism adsorption is one of the simple but effective processes for removal of organic and inorganic pollutants from the contaminated water adsorption is the phenomenon of aggregation of fluid gas or liquid on the surface of the adsorbent thus the hazardous contaminants from wastewater can be removed by contacting the effluent with a suitable adsorbent as a result the unwanted toxic materials are attached to the surface of the adsorbent and hence water is treated the adsorption process is demonstrated in terms of adsorption isotherm i e the relationship between the amount of solute adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbents and pressure at equilibrium conditions and is used to envisage the adsorption capacity of the developed materials the contaminant removal efficiency by adsorption depends on various factors like nature of the adsorbate and adsorbent the contact time between the adsorbent and the adsorbate adsorbent dosage and operating conditions such as solution s ph and temperature etc ayawei et al 40 describe several types of adsorption isotherms however langmuir and freundlich isotherms are the frequently used models applicable to homogenous and heterogeneous surfaces respectively langmuir model correlates the adsorption capacity with the initial concentration of adsorbent while freundlich isotherm represents the expression pertaining surface heterogeneity and the exponential distribution of active sites and their energies fig 5 depicts the general mechanism of methylene blue mb dye removal by adsorption process using go here go is used as an adsorbent in the wastewater containing mb it can be seen that after adding the adsorbent mb is adsorbed on the surface of go and the adsorbed mb can be separated along with go as a result treated water is obtained for the economic viability the used adsorbent must be regenerated by a suitable desorption process various methods are employed for the desorption process and depending on the conditions temperature ph change solvent or saline wash can be employed for the adsorbent regeneration purpose furthermore the chemical interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent played a significant role in removing the organic pollutants yang and xing 41 reported the five possible chemical interactions responsible for the removal of dye molecules and heavy metals on the surface of carbon based materials in nanoscale the important interactions including hydrophobic effect π π bonds hydrogen bonds covalent bond and electrostatic interactions the following section will discuss the recent literature reports dwelling adsorption process for water treatment using cnts and go rgo 3 2 cnt based adsorbent a variety of adsorbents such as activated carbon fly ash peat biomass and biomaterials like alginate chitosan etc have been used for the removal of heavy metals dyes and organic traces 4 however it was reported in the literature that these materials have either low adsorption capacities removal efficiencies or difficulties in regeneration 4 thus there is a search for developing a new adsorbent material which possesses higher adsorption capacity and easy regeneration for the effective treatment of wastewater for this reason cnts and its composites were studied and the effect of operating parameters has been reported in the literature 42 45 adsorption property of cnts strongly depends on the type of cnts presence of various functional groups 46 the impregnation of additives like metal oxides or polymers composites 47 nature of contaminants and operating parameters such as ph temperature and contact time between adsorbent and adsorbate table 1 summarizes the overview for the removal of various pollutants like heavy metals dyes and radioactive materials from aqueous solution using cnts and its composites as reported recently one of the most widely studied chemical compounds for the adsorption process using cnt is dye molecules and in most cases methylene blue mb was used as the model compound most of the dye molecules possess conjugated aromatic groups which can have π π interaction and nonpolar interaction with cnt surface it was also reported that the oxidized cnt material could be easily regenerated by using naoh solution and can be effectively reused in an interesting study 50 malachite green mg was efficiently removed by incorporating cnts with zeolitic imidazolate frameworks zif 8 the mg removal rate was almost twice by using the cnt hybrid material as compared to pure zif 8 alone the adsorption capacity of zif 8 hybrid was 2034 mg g while that of pure zif 8 was 1667 mg g it was also observed that 55 removal of mg was achieved by using pure zif 8 and hybrid zif 8 showed the much improved removal of 95 at the adsorbent dosage of 0 2 g l thus comparatively improved adsorption efficiency of mg was achieved by using cnt hybrid material than pure zif 8 this hybrid material has been regenerated by ethanol washing and can be reused up to 4 cycles without having any significant decline in performance the improved adsorption capacity of composite materials is attributed to the synergistic effect of covalent bonding between the parent and impregnated materials resulting in an attachment of various functional groups on the surface of cnts go rgo and exhibits improved specific surface area ssa hydrophilicity and electrostatic repulsion similarly other dye molecules like methyl orange mo tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa direct red 80 dr 80 basic red 46 br 46 chlorophenol cp and congo red cr were examined using different types of cnt based adsorbents as reported in the literature 42 51 48 52 53 a highly efficient functionalized cnt adsorbent material was developed by using 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes through the co condensation method and loaded with commercial tio2 42 the adsorption performance of the material was measured for the mo removal from aqueous solution it was found that 0 1 g l of adsorbent dosage completely remove the dye molecule within 30 min at an operating temperature of 25 c which corresponds to the maximum mo removal of 42 85 mg g an mwcnt stabilized cu2o nanoparticles pvp cnts cu2o were also reported for the adsorption of mg dye and tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa 51 this hybrid adsorbent exhibits excellent performance compared to pristine mwcnt for the removal of organic dye and tbbpa because of the synergistic properties of inorganic species and polymer the adsorption capacities for mg and tbbpa were 1495 46 and 116 72 mg g respectively by using pvp cnts cu2o which is much higher as compared to pure cnts 417 58 and 68 03 mg g in one of the recent report 48 mwcnt was oxidized to obtain cooh groups and embedded with magnetic nanoparticles of iron oxide mnps to develop the unique magnetic adsorbents embedded in gelatin bead matrix the proposed adsorbent was then tested for the removal of anionic dr 80 and cationic mb dye molecules it was found that the developed material exhibits comparatively higher adsorption efficiency of 96 1 for anionic dye dr than the cationic dye mb furthermore the effect of chemical modifications was also thoroughly investigated by developing three kind of adsorbents i e gel gel cnt and gel cnt mnps and observed that nanocomposite beads adsorbed 63 0 69 6 and 93 1 of anionic dye while only 17 9 64 2 and 76 1 of cationic dye respectively in general the opposite charge attaracts each other hence positively charged nanocomposite material has pronounced effect on negatively charged pollutant molecule vice versa this novel adsorbent showed remarkable performance in removing the ionic dyes and can be easily separated from the treated solution using magnetic field however no recycling experiments were reported for this material recently iron oxide magnetic mwcnts coated with calcium mmc was studied for the removal of humic acid ha 61 in this study the effect of exposure time and ph of the solution was explored it was reported that a maximum of 90 removal efficiency of ha was obtained using mmc with ha initial concentration and dosage of 20 mg l and 0 5 g l respectively at ph of 7 0 0 2 for a reaction time of 30 min it was further observed that the ph of the feed solution has no major impact on efficiency the mmc was regenerated through pre ultrasonic microwave technology and was effectively reused more than five cycles of regeneration as mmc offers higher ha removal than without calcium coated cnts because of the interaction of mmc and ha with metal cations ca2 by bridging and ligand phenomenon in another study 52 single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts carboxyl functionalized single walled carbon nanotubes swcnt cooh graphene g and graphene oxide go were used as alternative adsorbents for the removal of cationic dye br 46 from aqueous solution it was found that all the above mentioned materials can be used for the removal of br 46 by increasing contact time the removal of br 46 increases and reached equilibrium after 80 min for swcnts swcnt cooh and 90 min for g and go remarkable adsorption capacity of 110 and 140 mg g was achieved for br 46 by using swcnt and swcnt cooh respectively at equilibrium conditions when the initial concentration of pollutant was 60 mg l and adsorbent dosage was 0 05 g l nevertheless the separation of adsorbents was done by centrifuging and there was no adsorbent regeneration and recycling reported the removal of chlorophenol cp using mwcnts has also been reported for this carbon nanotube cnt hybridized with psf and polymer beads were fabricated via the phase inversion method 53 it was reported that enhanced cp adsorption was achieved by using hybrid polymer beads as compared to pure polymer or mwcnt the maximum adsorption capacity of 119 5 mg g was obtained by using 2 5 g l of hybrid adsorbent at 100 mg l initial concentration of cp it can be inferred from these results that composites of cnts exhibit better adsorption capacity for the organic molecules compared without cnts additionally the material in beads shape is advantageous for the separation of adsorbent yet the effectiveness of recycling experiments has not been reported recently chavoshan et al 62 compared the adsorption efficiency of single walled and multi walled carbon nanotubes for the removal of penicillin g from aqueous solution it was reported that swcnt exhibits relatively higher adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of 141 mg g and 68 25 as compared to mwcnts 119 mg g and 56 37 respectively for the same experimental conditions of 0 8 g l dosage and 50 mg l initial concentration of penicillin g solution a hybrid of mwcnt with polyamidoamine pamam 54 and amide group functionalized multi walled carbon nanotube embedded in hydroxyapatite sodium alginate matrix 55 were synthesized for the removal of co ii it was observed that 0 03 g l of pamam mwcnt composite could remove about 83 of co ii ions having the initial concentration of 100 mg l at 25 c the mwcnt hydroxyapatite sodium alginate hybrids were capable of removing co ii up to 347 8 mg g at the optimized condition the pamam cnt hybrid was also employed for ni as and zn removal and exhibiting separation efficiency of 98 88 and 86 respectively under the same process parameters and adsorption dosage 54 in another study lead pb was removed using melamine paraformaldehyde and various alkyl diamines based polyamine cnt cnt pa 57 and benzene 1 3 5 triamine paraformaldehyde and various alkyl diamines based polyamine cnt composites cnt tri 63 while for hg ii removal amidoamine functionalized multi walled carbon nanotubes mmcnt aa 59 was used at ambient temperature it was claimed that the adsorption capacity about 90 mg g was achieved and the developed material is highly selective for the mercury ions in the presence of other ions like cadmium magnesium calcium sodium etc present it was reported that it could be reused more than five cycles with 0 05 m edta washing for the regeneration in another study almost 99 of bismuth bi was removed from the aqueous solution of 30 mg l initial concentration by contacting it with 1 g l mwcnt in 30 min at 20 c 60 though the use of cnts as such provide the adsorption however the separation of cnt nanomaterial is challenging one and hence the hybridization with a polymer or magnetic particle will facilitate easy separation from the literature reports it can be summarized that cnts and its hybrids can effectively remove the metal ions from water the study of fundamental aspects of adsorption proves that it is possible to utilize cnts based materials for pollutant removal however the issue of recycling and regeneration studies will be further established to apply this new material in large scale there were few reports where cnts were imbedded in the polymer matrix as stable beads form 53 but the lack of recycling experiments makes it harder to understand the system for large scale applicability on the other hand there were many recycling experiments for the adsorption study but the adsorbents were found to be fine powder form and the recycling was done by centrifuge or filtration these recycling methods are not the preferred choice for large scale water treatment plants 3 3 go and rgo as an adsorbent the combination of high surface area the presence of oxygen based functional groups nonpolar interaction number of structural defects point line and void defects and π π interactions in go rgo make it one of the important adsorbents developed recently for the removal of the toxic contaminants in wastewater 64 68 eigler and feicht 62 briefly discussed various types of defects observed in go and its inferences as a structural motive there are two major types of defects namely in plane functionalized defects and out plane lattice defects which can be controlled and used as a structural motif for various applications the defects in the go rgo based materials drastically enhances the adsorption capacity because of the heavy metal ions agility through the newly created voids in a recent study gupta and khatri 69 investigated the effect of rgo on the removal of mg from aqueous solution it was found that by adding rgo 0 05 g l into 100 ml aqueous solution of mg 200 mg l the dye was completely adsorbed within 30 min of contact time the remarkable dye removal is due to the high surface area of rgo along with the strong interactions between the aromatic ring of mg and negatively charged functionalized rgo fig 6 a b illustrates the effect of ph on the removal efficiency of mg and sem image of rgo respectively it has also been reported that ph had a direct relation with mg removal i e by increasing the ph of the solution into mildly basic ph the adsorption kinetics has been increased from sem images of rgo it was found that rgo has voids which enhances the adsorption and thus 100 mg removal was achieved within 30 min at ph 7 or higher recently different kinds of adsorbent namely graphene oxide go silica sio2 and tin oxide sno2 have been synthesized and tested for zinc removal under different ph conditions it was found that go exhibits higher adsorption capacity of 243 mg g as compared to sio2 9 1 mg g and sno2 102 mg g interestingly by varying the ph zn2 adsorption mechanism on go surface varies more precisely zn2 explicitly governed by inner sphere and outer sphere surface mechanism at high and low ph respectively 67 go can also be embedded in biopolymers or magnetic nanoparticles to improve the easy separation of adsorbent after the target molecule removal for example mb removal from wastewater was reported using go and chitosan coated with iron oxide which removes 98 mb from aqueous solution 70 in comparison with go chitin nanofibrils which removes 90 for three cycles 71 in order to comparatively analyze the performance of cnts and go abdi et al 50 synthesized composites of zif 8 with cnt and go it was claimed that the nanocomposite made of zif with go revealed higher adsorption capacity of 3300 mg g as compared to zif cnt nanohybrid hence go rgo offers certain advantages over cnts additionally go cd β cyclodextrin and cufe2o4 rgo was also investigated for the removal of bpa 72 and cr 73 respectively these reports claimed that a maximum of 373 4 mg g bpa was adsorbed while for cr 81 mg g of removal was achieved using rgo composites and six recycling experiments were demonstrated with remaining adsorption capacity of about 90 the use of go rgo was also reported for the toxic contaminants from aqueous solution and some of the recent studies reported for the removal of heavy metals are presented in table 2 it was claimed that maximum adsorption capacity of 502 5 mg g of cr vi was achieved by using pmpd rgo nfo poly m phenylenediamine reduced graphene oxide nickel ferrite as an adsorbent 74 while for cu ii and pb ii removal the tartaric acid modified graphene oxide go ta was reported to be the better adsorbent with maximum adsorption capacities of 374 53 mg g 1 and 125 63 mg g 1 respectively and modified go showed improved adsorption compared to pristine go 75 in addition to this pb ii and co ii removal were also reported using go rgo hybrids compared to other adsorbents as listed in table 2 it can be inferred that up to 99 25 and 90 1 of pb ii and co ii was removed from aqueous solution using go hpei hyper branched polyethyleneimines 76 and zno nano rod rgo 77 as an adsorbent some other heavy metals radioactive elements such as sr ii cd ii and u vi were also removed by using go rgo based adsorbents the process parameters and adsorption performance were highlighted in table 2 in general compared to cnts the go rgo has better adsorption capacity and removal efficiency and this could be due to its versatility in terms of functional group present easy dispersion and better dispersion in the composite materials 4 catalytic degradation using cnms 4 1 catalytic degradation approach for pollutants removal the toxic pollutants can been effectively removed from wastewater using adsorption however the treatment ends up with the formation of the secondary waste product which cannot be processed again and should be dumped as such hazardous organic pollutants present in water can be effectively degraded catalytically by advanced oxidation process aop using nanostructured carbon materials in this process reactive hydroxyl radicals oh are generated which are highly oxidative towards organic molecules present in water and hence resulted in the decomposition of the toxic contaminants 88 interestingly catalytic degradation has advantage over adsorption as it encompasses the decomposition of organic materials even at low concentration ppb level without producing any secondary pollutant 89 fig 7 schematically illustrates the mechanistic aspect of catalytic degradation of dye molecule using ag zno mwcnt composite as an example in this instance it was proposed that the combination of zno photoexcitation and subsequent charge transfer to ag cnt surface creates superoxide radicals o2 by reacting with oxygen the superoxide radicals o2 reacts with the water molecule and produces the oh radicals which decompose the dye molecules by oxidative degradation the aop is considered to be the most efficient water treatment process as compared to other conventional processes as it can also be operated by sunlight rather than using uv or in the presence of visible mercury light sources etc depending upon the presence or absence of light source during the degradation process aop is broadly classified into two main types namely photochemical aop and non photochemical aop respectively ozonation wet peroxide ozonation o3 h2o2 catalytic ozonation and fenton based wet peroxidation h2o2 fe2 are the sub categories of non photochemical aop it was reported that non photochemical aop could not completely decompose the organic contaminants and to overcome this shortcoming photochemical aop has been preferred in recent times for the decontamination of wastewater 90 some of the most widely studied photochemical aops include o3 h2o2 uv photo fenton reaction and photocatalytic reaction uv tio2 in a recent report 91 the meticulous mechanism of all the subclasses of aops was discussed in detail specifically cnts and go has been employed for the removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs which otherwise cause serious health issues such as cancerous tumors birth defects obesity diabetes and fertility problems 92 fu et al 93 synthesized titania go tgo nanocomposite for the degradation of edcs and reported that tgo exhibits higher phenolic degradation as compared to pristine go and titania in general the hybrid nanomaterials enhances the degradation process and thus effectively treated the wastewater by a physical chemical and biological process the following section presents recent literature reports of nanomaterials and their composites of cnts go and rgo for catalytic degradation pollutants present in the wastewater 4 2 catalytic degradation of organic contaminants using cnts cnts have been employed as an effective means of degrading organic contaminants from wastewater by conventional chemical aop or photocatalytic degradation process 94 97 in a recent study 98 aluminum silicate multi walled carbon nanotube composite was coated with ferrocene groups si al fe mwcnt for oxidative decomposition and de colorization of methyl orange mo methyl blue mb orange g og and acid orange 7 ao7 the key process controlling parameters such as ph reaction time initial h2o2 concentration catalyst loading and temperature of the reaction were also investigated recently azzam et al 95 synthesized cnts tio2 agnps surfactant nanocomposites for photocatalytic degradation of mb it was claimed that the incorporation of cnts enhances the surface and electronic properties of tio2 while agnps improves the stability of the developed catalyst by reducing the reclamation of electron hole pair resulted in lower bandgap energy 2 25 ev larger surface area and higher catalytic degradation of mb tio2 coated mwcnt also reported for the photocatalytic disinfection of bacterial endospores 99 it was observed that the oh radical generated due to the heterogeneous fenton like oxidation was responsible for the decomposition of dye molecules by using si al fe mwcnts alone without h2o2 the maximum removal efficiency of ao7 og mb and mo were 32 9 63 7 75 6 and 99 9 respectively was observed for the exposure time of 140 min however the addition of h2o2 completely removes the mo mb og and ao7 in 6 10 12 and 30 min respectively this might be due to more oh radical generation because of the addition of h2o2 which were responsible for the decomposition of dye molecules it was further claimed that this novel catalyst si al fe mwcnt was highly stable and can decompose toxic dyes effectively for more than seven cycles of fenton type oxidation without decreasing the degradation efficiency in another report 100 a novel catalytic degradation process using microwave induced carbon nanotubes mw cnts as the catalyst was introduced for the removal of organic pollutants from aqueous solution the experimental studies were carried out to analyze the effect of mwcnt size diameter on the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants the diameter of cnts is in the range of 10 20 nm 20 40 nm and 40 60 nm for the catalytic degradation of organic contaminants it was suggested that by using 10 20 nm cnts 100 degradation of mo was obtained in just 7 min for the solution having the initial concentration of 25 mg l and 1 2 g l of catalyst dosage for the synthesis microwaves with a power of 450 w and 2450 mhz frequency were applied the catalyst was recycled five times and each cycle the efficiency of catalyst degraded considerably the use of high amount cnts for the removal of a small quantity of dye molecules the system may not be cost effective for the large scale setup and maybe the adsorption process competing with the degradation process in this particular system in addition to this some other organic dye molecules were also investigated under the optimum conditions and it was claimed that mwcnt could be an effective treatment process for the removal of organic dyes from aqueous solution the rate constants k for the degradation of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs methylene blue mb methyl parathion mp methyl orange mo and bisphenol a bpa using 10 20 nm mw cnts process were 0 726 0 679 0 463 0 334 and 0 168 min 1 respectively it was hypothesized that smaller diameter of cnt resulted in an increased surface area hence the degradation of organic compounds was more for smaller diameter catalyst as compared to the bigger one in this particular study the catalyst used for the degradation is almost five times compared to the molecule decomposed which is very high and unusual for catalytic processes tio2 nanoparticle is considered to be one of the most effective photocatalysts for the degradation of organic molecules 101 consequently the combination of mwcnts and tio2 composite for the degradation of the organic pollutants were reported 102 it was found that at a very low addition of mwcnts 0 6 wt to tio2 nanoparticles 4 chlorophenol was completely degraded in two hours at 365 nm irradiation this might be due to the presence of mwcnt which act as an electron sink thereby facilitating better charge separation in addition to the photochemical process organic pollutants can also be degraded sonochemically recently a novel sonocatalytic nanocomposite of sno2 mwcnt was synthesized by the sol gel process in the autoclave followed by thermal annealing the sno2 mwcnt hybrid was investigated for decomposition of mb dye molecules as a model solution 103 it was reported that sno2 mwcnt nanocomposite completely decomposed the mb dye with a higher reaction rate as compared to pure sno2 or a simple physical mixture of sno2 and mwcnt it was hypothesized that the efficient utilization of light emitted during bubble collapse and better separation of electron hole pairs as well as the transfer of electrons from sno2 to mwcnt were the reasons for an effective decomposition of the dye molecule cnt based nano photocatalytic material was synthesized using the co precipitation decomposition method it was observed that the addition of 5 wt mwcnt to ag zno cnt could produce superior photocatalytic activity 100 removal of ao7 as compared to ag zno alone 87 removal under visible light 88 the presence of mwcnt facilitated better electron hole separation hence exhibits better catalytic degradation compared to catalyst without mwcnt various parameters like ph amount of photocatalyst and dye concentration on photodegradation of dye molecules were studied the initial concentration of the solution and the catalyst dosage was set to be 20 mg l and 1 g l respectively for the reaction time of 2 h importantly the synthesized catalyst showed better reusability for the recycling experiments a detailed mechanistic approach is presented for the degradation of ao7 using ag zno cnt nano photocatalyst as shown in fig 7 similarly graphene based mno2 has been impregnated on cnts by varying the calcination temperature and used for the catalytic degradation of basic red 18 br18 it was reported that by increasing the calcination temperature from 400 to 600 c the porosity of the developed material reduces significantly furthermore the developed material can easily be recycled and showed superior regeneration performance by effectively decolorizing rb18 dye 96 recently the magnetic nanohybrid material was synthesized using polypyrrole cnts cofe2o4 cnts cofe2o4 ppy for the degradation of anionic and cationic dyes 104 the high catalytic performance excellent adsorption and greater stability of this unique material make it a promising candidate for water treatment it was concluded that 1 g l dosage of cnts cofe2o4 ppy and 4 mmol l of peroxymonosulfate pms could completely decompose mb having an initial concentration of 50 mg l in 30 min the catalyst was magnetically separated and reused for five times by freshly adding pms for the mb degradation by the oxidation process in addition to dyes several plasticizers such as diethyl phthalate dep used in polymer industries have been categorized as an endocrine disruptor therefore if such molecules were present in water these should be degraded before discharging into the ecological systems in one such study 105 copper ferrite decorated multi walled carbon nanotubes magnetic nanoparticles cufe2o4 mwcnts mnps were introduced for the degradation of dep using persulfate ps in comparison with mwcnts and cufe2o4 the above mentioned mnps drastically decomposed dep at ambient temperature and can be recycled up to 5 times without a noticeable decrease in performance it can be summarized that the addition of metal oxide and other composites of cnts improves the catalytic performance and hence significantly degrades toxic contaminants from aqueous solution most of the catalytic degradation studies have been performed using dye molecules as the model compound and further research work should be carried out to synthesize novel hybrid metal oxide cnt nanocomposites and examined for the variety of other pollutants to have the broader application of this new material 4 3 go rgo as catalysts in water treatment go rgo and their composites have been reported widely as one of the promising nanocatalysts for degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater the catalytic degradation was carried out similar to cnts by incorporating semiconductor nanomaterials into the graphene layer for degrading organic molecules 106 go rgo and their combination with different metal oxides were used as a photocatalyst electrocatalyst and fenton based catalyst for the effective oxidation of organic contaminants in wastewater treatment 107 109 this section summarizes various go rgo based nano catalytic materials for the decomposition of toxic organic pollutants reported in the latest literature mohamed et al 110 reported the synthesis of manganese ferrite graphene hybrid photocatalyst using sol gel process a nano spindle structure with monomodal mesopore type of material was synthesized by using 91 wt of go and 9 wt of mnfe2o4 the resulted material was tested for the photocatalytic degradation of mb in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation it was claimed that 1 g l of this material completely degrades mb initial concentration of 10 mg l in 30 min with a rate constant of 0 037 min 1 similarly cadmium based nanocatalyst cds rgo was prepared by using a one step gamma ray radiation induced reduction method 111 this catalyst was tested for the degradation of rhodamine b rh b and almost 93 removal efficiency under visible light irradiation was reported in another study 112 nanocomposites of tio2 cds rgo were synthesized by the solvothermal method and tested as a photocatalytic material for the removal of organic pollutants it was observed that tio2 cds rgo has a higher surface area of 109 7 m2 g as compared to tio2 cds 67 m2 g and cds 53 m2 g due to the higher surface area the photocatalytic reaction showed faster decomposition compared to catalyst without go the results indicated that this hybrid material could decompose mb and rh b up to 97 5 and 93 5 respectively in just 20 min using visible light irradiation for comparison the degradation of mb with tio2 cds rgo tio2 cds and cds alone reached 97 5 94 0 and 78 5 respectively in 20 min reaction time at the same condition the degradation rate of rhb reached 93 5 87 5 and 74 8 respectively which demonstrated the synergetic role of graphene oxide for the catalyst a unique magnetic nanocomposite consisting of cufe2o4 go was synthesized by the hydrothermal method for the decomposition of dyes 113 various experimental parameters like ph the dosage of catalyst initial dye concentration were studied and a maximum decomposition of 95 was achieved at the dosage of 0 8 g l in 50 min the reported nanocatalyst has been effective in dyes degradation in the presence of visible light and it was easily recyclable using magnetic separation additionally it was reused up to 5 cycles without any noticeable decrease in catalytic performance the detailed mechanistic study using scavengers revealed that o2 and hole h radicals were responsible for dye degradation the schematic photocatalytic degradation mechanism is shown in fig 8 in another study 114 flower like tio2 sphere fts reduced graphene oxide was proposed for the catalytic degradation of rh b and trichloroethylene tce it was reported that about 95 and 80 removal of rh b and tce was achieved under the simulated solar light the recycled catalyst showed no decrease in catalytic activity up to four cycles recently 115 au was decorated on tio2 and tio2 on rgo to enhance the surface area and photocatalytic degradation process acid blue ab 92 was used as the model compound and the uv vis light was used for the photocatalytic decomposition of dye molecules it was reported that the incorporation of graphene and au nanoparticles to tio2 enhances the surface area reduces the crystalline size thus more effectively degrade the ab 92 molecule from aqueous solution as compared to pure tio2 the simple modification of tio2 with rgo has also been reported 116 in this case rgo tio2 84 wt tio2 nano hybrid was synthesized by the spray drying process and was compared with pure tio2 for removal of mb it was found that 92 and 71 decomposition efficiency of mb was achieved using rgo tio2 and pure tio2 respectively it was hypothesized that this might be because of change in charge recombination due to the presence of rgo which promotes the electron hole separation for degrading the dye a similar type of nano composites made of rgo and tio2 was also prepared by direct sol gel and hydrothermal process and tested for mb degradation using uv light irradiation 117 a maximum of 93 and 82 of mb separation was achieved with 1 9 of rgo to tio2 prepared by sol gel and hydrothermal processes respectively an electro catalytic nitrogen doped graphene aerogel ngas were proposed recently for the treatment of bpa from synthetic wastewater 118 the newly developed material was also compared with commercially available carbon electrodes it was claimed that the ngas showed better electrochemical activity and can efficiently treat wastewater containing bpa than the previously existed commercial materials more than 90 removal of bpa 15 mg l initial concentration was achieved in 30 min by using ngas a detailed analysis of degradation products showed that the oh radicals by water electrolysis were the reason for the decomposition of bpa it was also stated that these materials could be used for more than fifty cycles of treatment with the negligible change in catalytic performance recently extensive research was carried out by combining rgo with different metal oxide materials for wastewater treatment rgo composites were synthesized in combination with ag 119 tio2 cds 120 biocl 121 ceo2 122 agbr ag n 123 wmz ws2 nanosheet mg doped zno 124 graphite oxide gox 125 zno nanorod 77 and bipo4 126 etc the effective degradation of the pollutant molecule depends on the efficient charge transfer behavior of metal incorporated for example the incorporation of cds tio2 on go sheets enhances the catalytic degradation efficiency of mb this is because of the reason that the cds act as an electron donor in tio2 while go acts as an electron acceptor and adsorber for effective decomposition of organic contaminants under visible light irradiation the developed material gets excited and cds produces negative and positive charge particles the generated electrons and holes reacts with the oxygen molecule and hydroxyl ion of aqueous solution resulting in oxygen peroxide radicals o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh respectively that will effectively decompose the dye molecules present in the aqueous solution 120 similarly the impregnation of biocl and ceo2 over go improves the electron transfer ability and enhances the degradation properties of hybrid materials like wisely the catalytic performance of the mg doped zno rgo was improved by introducing ws2 nanosheets attributed to defects formation and efficient electron hole separation 124 table 3 depicts the degradation reaction details regarding the treatment of a number of pollutants by various go rgo catalysts reported in the literature last three years the table contains the main operating parameters such as nature of the catalytic material amount of dosage type and concentration of pollutant reaction conditions reaction time reaction rate and removal efficiency invariably in each specific case higher decomposition of dyes and other toxic pollutants were achieved by using go rgo coated with metal oxides and their composites as compared to the pure catalyst this might be due to the higher surface area avoiding charge recombination for electron hole separation specific crystal structure and promoting radical generation oh and so4 etc it was claimed that almost 100 removal efficiency of hazardous pollutants could be obtained by using hybrid nano composites 93 112 119 123 124 127 134 in addition to this a variety of novel catalytic materials consisting of go rgo were prepared and studied for the degradation of rhb 77 122 124 125 135 in case of rh b the rgowmz was the most effective catalysts for degradation of rh b and within 5 min complete decomposition was observed under sunlight 124 nitrogen doped graphene oxide and its composites were also synthesized in the recent years and tested for the removal of pollutants like bpa 118 smx sulfamethoxazole 128 mb 130 oa 131 136 2 cp 123 rh 6 g 137 and rh b 77 etc these non metallic nanostructured materials such as ndg nitrogen doped graphene ngas nitrogen doped graphene aerogels and nghs nitrogen doped graphene hydrogels significantly reduced the water contaminants and can be further studied for the better understanding to treat industrial effluents containing hazardous pollutants for example fe fe3c nanoparticles loaded on fe n doped graphene showed consistent catalytic degradation for more than 13 cycles with an efficiency of about 95 removal 137 in summary it can be inferred that go rgo and their composites could be an alternative catalytic materials for an effective and efficient degradation of toxic contaminants in most cases oxidative decomposition of organic molecules was done in the case of hybrid materials the charge transfer mechanism is the predominant pathway for catalytic degradation as the natural progression the toxic effect of residual nanocatalyst present in the discharged water and large scale synthesis of the catalyst has to be done and the use of real wastewater samples are necessary 5 membrane technology based on cnms 5 1 basic principles of membrane for water treatment membrane technology is one of the preferred choices for the water desalination and wastewater treatment due to its modular approach and high purity of treated water at a reasonable cost a membrane is a barrier which allows specific species to pass through while blocking the flow of other species 2 membranes are broadly based on two main families of materials namely polymeric and inorganic membranes both of these membranes have advantages and limitations by taking advantages from each two organic inorganic hybrid membrane with improved performance can also be developed 140 the membrane processes separate water from heavy metals dyes salts and ultra fine particles including biological species like bacteria s and viruses etc the basic principle of membrane process and its applications are elaborately discussed in these references 141 142 in water treatment processes on the basis of membrane pore size membrane separation processes are classified into four main types namely microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro the pore size in the selective layer decreases from mf to ro as shown in fig 9 a consequently the resistance for the passage of aqueous media increases from bigger pore size to smaller pore an overview of membrane separation processes on the basis of pore size and passage and the rejection of solutes is also shown schematically in fig 9 a it can be seen that suspended solids and bacteria s are blocked by all four types of membranes however the diameter of the virus is less than that of the mf membrane pore size so virus and similar size particulate matters could be pass through from the mf membrane while it can be blocked by the other three types of membrane furthermore it can be evident from fig 9 a that for the separation of multivalent ions nf or ro membranes should be used because mf and uf have the bigger pore size hence the inability to block these species for the separation of very small molecules such as monovalent ions only ro can be used thus the selection of membrane depends on the nature of species removal although ro is considered to be the most suitable membrane for the separation of small sized contaminant like monovalent ions it also offers more resistance to the flow of treated fluid water due to the nature of selective layer where molecular passage is by diffusion process fick s law whereas mf and uf are based on size exclusion pore flow mechanism darcy s law nf membrane is considered in between these two processes besides many advantages membrane technology has also some limitations such as fouling or pore blockage thereby lowering the water flux the issue of fouling reduction can be improved up to certain level by using a variety of new material such as cnms and its composites because of their incredible chemical inertness high surface area and mechanical and thermal stability the incorporation of cnts go into polymeric membranes remarkably improves the antifouling behavior of the nanocomposite membranes by reducing the surface roughness enhancing the rejection efficiency and increasing the hydrophilicity 143 the composite nature of cnms and polymer synergistically enhance the performance of membrane compared to the pure polymer membrane due the presence of cnms the above mentioned superior properties of cnms were reinforcing the polymeric composite membrane by physicochemical interaction cheng et al 144 impregnated go and pvp on pvdf based ultrafiltration membrane and reported that the developed membrane showed higher water flux and effluent rejection performance compared to pristine pvdf membrane the increase in permeability and anti fouling resistance of hybrid membrane is because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between go and pvp vatanpour et al 145 compared the pristine polyethersulfone pes membrane with 0 04 wt mwcnts incorporated pes membrane and claimed that the mwcnt pes offers lowest fouling ratio of 12 than pristine pes membrane 70 fig 9 b presents the schematic of water penetration pathways through vertically aligned va cnts modified polymeric membranes cnt modified membranes enhances the water flux 3 4 times as compared to unmodified membrane because of the water transport between the nano confinement and through va cnt pores 146 the following sections provide an overview of the existing latest literature on cnms membranes using cnts go rgo and their composites for water treatment applications 5 2 cnt based membranes based on its high aspect ratios smooth hydrophobic walls specially aligned atoms and inner pore diameter cnts could be an attractive material in advanced membrane technologies for water treatment it was reported that enhanced flux up to 4 5 times were obtained using aligned cnts based membrane compared to other conventional membranes 148 theoretically ideal aligned cnt membrane offers almost frictionless water flow inside the core of the tube and excellent retention based on the tube diameter cnt based membranes can be generally classified into two types i e vertically aligned va and mixed matrix mm cnt membranes va can be synthesized by organizing cnts perpendicularly with supportive filler materials while the development of mm cnt membrane is a simple and cost effective process the mm cnt membrane also showed enhanced water flux compared to existing membranes limitations and shortcomings of some conventional membranes such as fouling irregular pore size pore blocking and regeneration could be improved using mm cnt membranes and its composites the mm cnt membranes can also be used to increase water permeability solutes rejection and mechanical strength table 4 summarizes the detailed literature reports on cnt based membranes and its composites for wastewater treatment applications for the last three years the following section discusses in detail a few selective examples the nitrogen doped cnt composite membrane was synthesized using nanoporous anodic aluminum membranes naams by a chemical vapor deposition process it was observed that the most efficient n doped cnt composite was achieved by combining carbon and nitrogen in a ratio of 5 to 1 the performance of this novel material is measured in terms of ionic dye molecules separation it was proposed that the n doped cnt membranes can also be used in catalysis molecular separation and sensing applications as well 149 apart from nitrogen doping cnt based membranes can also be doped with different functionalities like biocide catalyst etc for the water treatment process in one such study 150 silver doped cnt membrane was developed by a wet chemical process for the removal of bacteria in wastewater it was observed that 10 of ag doped cnt based membrane was the optimum condition for removing nearly 100 bacteria these types of membranes are more suitable for the removal of various water born infectious species recently sandwich like cnt hollow fiber membranes hfm were developed by the wet air method for the removal of microcystin lr a toxin produced by cyanobacteria from wastewater by electrochemical degradation 151 it was found that 99 8 of separation efficiency was achieved thus cnt hfm was demonstrated for the removal of microcystin lr with excellent regeneration capacity by the electrochemical process a new cnt based membrane for hemodialysis was also attempted by using polyethersulfone pes and its composites with mwcnt by phase inversion method 152 the subsequent membrane was tested for the rejection of bovine serum albumin bsa it was observed that 98 bsa rejection was achieved with 150 lmh of water flux by using pes poly citric acid g mwcnt membrane as compared to pure pes membrane which had the water flux of 22 57 lmh and 86 bsa rejection the blood dialysis study and protein rejection coupled with high flux demonstrated the superiority of the cnt hybrid membrane compared to pure pes membrane in another study the chromate ions removal was reported using pes supported fe ag functionalized mwcnt 153 the oxidized mwcnt was used for the tethering of fe ag nanoparticles by microwave assisted polyol method and subsequently dispersed in pes followed by phase inversion method it was reported that 1 fe ag fmwcnts addition in pes has the highest water flux of 36 9 lmh with 94 8 chromate ions removal by donnan exclusion principle and pure pes membrane showed negligible chromate ion removal with inferior flux a recent report states that almost 90 of zn removal was feasible by using oxygen functionalized mwcnts by argon o2 plasma treatment deposited on the hollow fiber membrane surface 154 in addition to this thin film nanocomposite tfn nanofiltration membranes were prepared using sulfonated mwcnt 155 and polypyrrole ppy oxidized mwcnts 156 both the material showed 96 8 and 97 9 na2so4 rejection with water flux of 13 2 lmh and 96 6 lmh respectively which were superior to the simple tfc films and the fouling resistance showed much improvement due to the presence of hydrophilized cnts zno tethered mwcnt nanofiltration pes membrane was also demonstrated for the dye removal 157 mechanically improved mwcnt biopolymer buckypaper membrane was also prepared using common biopolymers like chitosan gellan gum etc and the resulted membrane showed the effective separation of trace organic contaminants and inorganic solutes 158 fig 10 a b represents the schematic of cnt and go doped membrane for heavy metal and dyes removal respectively in another study it was reported that polypropylene pp based membranes were synthesized with and without carbon nanotube immobilization 159 the developed membranes were tested for direct contact membrane distillation dcmd with the initial salt concentration of 10 000 mg l it was found that 99 9 of salt rejection was achieved with 36 8 lmh of water vapor flux the flux was almost 52 higher for cnt composite membrane than unmodified pp membrane thus from the discussed results it is clear that the composites of cnms improve the membrane flux and rejection compared to the pure polymeric membrane and these hybrid membranes could be promising materials for removing hazardous and toxic residues from wastewater with enhanced water flux and minimal fouling 5 3 go and rgo based membranes in recent years go rgo has attracted more focus compared to cnts for the membrane preparation and demonstrated high separation capacity of various hazardous and toxic contaminants this widespread attention is because of its exceptional hydrophilic surface characteristics and well organized 2d nanofluidic channels for molecular transport 162 164 this section describes selective recent literature reports of go rgo and its composites as membrane materials for water purification the hybrid nafion nanocomposite membrane was synthesized by the solvent casting method using a variety of fillers such as anatase type tio2 nanoparticles graphene oxide go and organo modified graphene oxide gosulf 165 the resultant product was tested for the removal of mo from wastewater by degradation in solution and adsorption on the membrane surface for the effective separation based on catalytic membrane separation all the membranes were subjected for 3 hours photo catalytic degradation of mo with an initial concentration of 2 10 5 m it was found that nafion gosulf is the most efficient membrane for the treatment and had highest mo removal of 71 and rate constant and 0 0077 min 1 as compared to other membranes accordingly it was suggested that tio2 go and gosulf can be incorporated in nafion for effective degradation of dye molecules go was also impregnated with psf for the preparation of mixed matrix membrane using the non solvent induced phase inversion method and tested for separation of heavy metals from wastewater 166 it was claimed that the proposed membrane could remove up to 96 of metal ions such as pb cu cd and cr with a permeate flux of 30 lmh for initial metal ion concentration of 50 mg l in the feed the spent membranes were regenerated by di water wash and passing hcl solution of ph 5 5 for 30 min at a constant flowrate of 30 l h after removing all the contaminants the hcl regenerated membrane was thoroughly rinsed with water in order to attain neutral ph the results revealed that the regeneration of the membrane has been effective by in situ chemical treatment process with a flux recovery ratio frr of 0 92 166 the fouling issues of cnms based membranes can be resolved by incorporating several active materials like the catalyst biocide etc into the cnms surface layers this active material can be triggered for the removal of fouling materials on the membrane surface fig 11 shows the basic concept of go based nanoparticles composite membranes with cross linking agents on an ultrafiltration membrane support this type of concept was reported recently 167 where go was embedded with titanium nanowires tnw modified by triethanolamine teoa it was found that the modified membrane enhances the water flux because of improved nano channeling and is more stable in the aqueous solution for long time operations the fouling resistance for the membrane was demonstrated by congo red decomposition using uv light irradiation ontio2 nanowires recently guo et al 168 modified pvdf based hollow fiber membranes hfms with cnts and tested for the treatment of real sewage effluent the performance of the modified membrane was also enhanced by preozonation the results revealed that ozone dosage and cnts modified hollow fiber membrane produces high quality permeate by effectively controlling the biofouling because of the deposition of cnts layers inside the hfms the developed membranes were also regenerated by backwashing the treated effluent and exhibits higher regeneration ability compared to unmodified membranes go flakes were also embedded in pes mm membrane for the treatment of spent wash from distilleries 169 in order to increase the hydrophilicity paa and licl were used separately as additives with go pes mm membrane it was reported that the contact angle for the modified membrane was decreased from 70 8 to 58 4 with a maximum of 54 color removal from distillery spent wash safarpour et al 170 blended rgo tio2 with pes for the preparation of nano filtration membranes to enhance the antifouling and separation performance it was reported that the blended membrane showed superior water permeability and fouling resistance in comparison with pure pes membrane without rgo tio2 the highest mean pore diameter of 4 74 nm and water flux of 45 0 lmh was achieved by blending 0 15 wt of rgo tio2 with pes the water flux observed was almost twice as that of pure pes membranes without rgo tio2 the antifouling characteristic of the membrane was measured by using a bsa solution it was found that 0 1 wt rgo tio2 membrane has the best antifouling resistance furthermore the rejection properties of synthesized membranes were also tested for this purpose three different organic dyes with an initial concentration of 100 mg l were used the report reveals that rgo tio2 pes has the maximum rejection efficiency of 99 4 for rg 19 and has higher permeability and effective antifouling characteristics as compared to tio2 pes and go pes membranes in another study 171 a composite of go with tio2 got was synthesized as an ultrafiltration membrane and was compared with pure tio2 membrane without go these membranes were used for the removal of organic pollutants by the photocatalytic mechanism under brackish water saline condition it was reported that got membrane showed higher porosity maximum flux and enhanced antifouling properties as compared to tio2 and decompose diphenhydramine dp and methyl orange mo in the presence of near uv vis and visible light irradiation interestingly the presence of chloride anions which can act as the hole and hydroxyl radical scavengers did not adversely affect the photocatalytic performance but had a detrimental effect on the efficiency of the membrane the synthesized membrane has been easily regenerated by water and ethanol wash displaying the same water flux and rejection rate go based psf hybrid porous membrane adsorber psf go was developed for the removal of seven selected organic contaminants of emerging concern eocs 172 almost 90 of these hazardous materials could be removed after 4 h of operation psf membranes coated with go by imprinting were also produced by kibechu et al 173 to enhance water flux hydrophilicity removal of salts and hydrocarbons from water the coated membranes exhibit higher flux 15 3 lmh and more than 65 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah removal and na2so4 rejection rate of 76 as compared to pure psf membranes which had 8 56 lmh flux and 57 2 rejection respectively to overcome the fouling issues of go membranes a hybrid go tio2 membrane having water filtration and pollutants degradation properties were prepared by single step sol gel process 174 the performance of the membrane has been tested for the degradation of mb by photo catalytically using uv light it was claimed that up to 92 of mb was degraded in 110 min of irradiation this hybrid membrane effectively controls membrane fouling and 96 of flux recovery was reported a hierarchal structured go membrane with thin film catalytic coating of tio2 was developed for water filtration and photocatalytic degradation 175 it was described that permeate flux has an inverse relation with catalyst loading because of the formation of additional cake resistance by catalyst coating on the other hand more catalyst loading enhances dye removal so for maximum flux complete photo degradation and higher dye adsorption catalyst loading and concentration has been optimized the congo red dye 400 mg of tio2 nanosheets tns and graphene oxide go in 100 ml were loaded in dead end filtration cell and at optimum conditions complete removal of dye with a water flux of 29 3 lmh was observed the go based membrane has also been studied for the heavy metals recovery and removal from wastewater 176 go was deposited as an organized layer on hollow fiber support torlon using a layer by layer approach lbl the developed material had an excellent nanofiltration enactment and exhibited super stability during a 150 h filtration test it can remove more than 95 of pb2 ni2 and zn2 with a water flux of 4 7 lmhbar 1 pes membrane embedding with pani go was developed as a composite membrane for metal ions removal 0 25 pani go nanoparticles were reported to be the optimum quantity deposited on pes resulting in 100 pb2 separation the durability and reusability of the developed membrane were measured by immersing the spent membrane in 10 mm edta for 1 h followed by di water wash the regenerated membrane was again processed for lead removal revealing 5 decrease in removal efficiency from 1st cycle to 5th cycle 177 the dye removal has also been studied using go blended pvdf nano hybrid membrane pvdf was solution blended with go tio2 to produced ultrafiltration membranes via phase inversion method and found that water flux was improved almost two times about 500 lmh by using this membrane as compared to pristine pvdf 178 the go tio2 catalytic membrane showed better recovery from fouling zhu et al 179 synthesized pvdf based hybrid membranes of go by the phase inversion process various membranes were prepared by changing go content from 0 wt to 0 9 wt it was reported that 0 5 wt of go based pvdf go nano hybrid achieved maximum water flux of 61 90 lmh at 100 kpa the dye molecule rh b was used to measure the performance of this membrane in terms of membrane adsorption it was reported that even after 20 cycles dye adsorption rates and recovery ratios of nanohybrid membranes was78 2 and 67 8 respectively a composite photocatalytic integrated membrane process was reported using graphitic carbon nitride nanosheet reduced graphene oxide cellulose acetate g c3n4 ns rgo ca 180 the performance of the membrane was tested using rh b and it was found that permeate flux and rh b removal was 3 7 times and 4 times more than that of pure ca membrane with significant improvement in fouling resistance under visible light irradiation go was also be incorporated in the pvdf membrane using trivalent ions such as al3 and fe3 as crosslinkers for the removal of natural organic matter nom as reported by liu 181 it was noticed that trivalent ions enhanced the membrane strength the water flux is 1 1 2 3 times more for fe3 crosslinked membrane as compared to al3 however both the membranes showed the same level of removal efficiency besides trivalent ions go was also cross linked with isophorone diisocyanate ipdi to synthesize covalently modified graphene oxide nanosheets 182 the prepared membrane exhibited enhanced water flux of 80 100 lmh at a low operating pressure of 1 0 bar with the rejection rate of 96 and 70 for dyes and heavy metals respectively recently a study on 3d nanoporous crystals embedded rgo membrane with 2d channels was fabricated 183 it was reported that this unique membrane has almost 15 times more water flux with the same contaminants retention as compared to go membranes because of more inter layer spacing and nanofluidic channels a novel mussel inspired dopamine method was proposed for the production of reduced graphene oxide graphitic carbon nitride rgo g c3n4 nanocomposite membranes for wastewater treatment and oil water emulsion separation 184 it was claimed that the membrane performance extensively depends on g c3n4 ratio and oil water separation efficiency and retention of mb was more than 99 this novel membrane can be reused effectively without considerable change in performance after five cycles of regeneration if appropriately utilized both cnt and go rgo based nanocomposite membranes exhibit superior membrane performance compared to the pure polymeric membrane the superior property is due to the presence of cnms which incorporate and improve the porosity wettability and anchoring the catalyst etc of the membrane unlike cnms based adsorption or catalytic processes the membrane separation process does not have the issue of nanomaterial leaching if phase inversion process used for the membrane preparation the nanomaterials physically trapped in the solidified polymer matrix hence operationally membrane process can be less problematic compared to other methods namely adsorption and catalytic degradation of pollutant removal therefore cnms based membranes may provide a solution for emerging pollutant removal 6 challenges and outlooks of cnms in wastewater treatment the water treatment using cnms already moved from conceptual demonstration to model compound study adsorption and catalytic degradation processes were mostly demonstrated by using dye molecules as the model compound for the adsorption and catalytic degradation as the logical progression it needs to go towards real sample study and upscaling the process however there are still some challenges that need to be addressed to utilize the full benefits of these fascinating new materials the separation of cnms after usage is still challenging in adsorption and catalytic process the use of cnms as such is practically challenging due to its nano size which disperses easily in air and water thus there is always the possibility of leaching to the environment if leaching happens then the consequence of cnms in the treated water creates the new added problem the hybridization solves the leaching considerably at the cost of reduced performance due to the loss of active area site of cnms the second issue that needs to be addressed is the number of reuse of cnms in adsorption and catalytic process most of the literature reports either deal with up to 5 cycles or no recycling at all the number of reuse study should be increased considerably with real samples however cnms fit extremely well in the membrane technology and if the well known processes like phase inversion of organic polymers used then the issues mentioned above are not arising due to the complete arrest of cnms in the polymer matrix the complete utilization of inherent properties of cnms is extremely challenging in the area of membrane technology this is akin to aquaporin system where it was emphatically proven that aquaporin proteins could pass the water molecule at the unprecedented rate however utilizing this unparalleled behavior into a useful product is still a challenging one like aquaporin the individual cnt tubes possess extremely high water flux with an almost frictionless flow of water molecule in the interior of the tube while rejecting the ions however assembling the cnts without compromising its inherent properties into a usable end product as the membrane has a considerable challenge the vertically aligned cnts can be prepared straightforward but transferring those cnts into usable membrane format in large scale without defects has not been succeeded in more than a decade currently go rgo has been studied extensively for the membrane separation by stacking the graphene layer in small scale it needs to be seen whether this process can be upscaled for the real application therefore the need of the hour is the use of cnms in the existing process like phase inversion in membrane preparation pelletization of cnms for adsorption and catalysis might be a more practical approach for immediate benefit in the hybridization process cnms may lose some of its intrinsic advantageous properties nevertheless it provides a real solution for the effective treatment of water wastewater compared to cnts go rgo has some advantages like easy preparation in the lab complete dispersibility in water further chemical modification of go thereby changing its wettability from hydrophilic to hydrophobic etc however the large scale synthesis of go is done by using hazardous wet chemical oxidation in contrast the largescale synthesis of cnts is straightforward nowadays therefore facile synthesis of go at benign conditions needs to be developed finally cnms application demonstrations still dominated by model compound studies in fact last three years literature reports predominately dealt with model compound studies and real wastewater treatment using cnms is hardly reported therefore the real water samples need to be studied for the successful demonstration which can be further utilized by industries the use of real water sample is paramount because most of the real water sample is much complicated than model compound studies done in the laboratories 7 conclusion this review highlights the applications of cnms nanomaterials particularly cnts and go rgo in water and wastewater treatment cnts go rgo and variety of their composites have been employed for the removal of heavy metals and dyes from aqueous solution the three main modes of separation mechanism namely adsorption catalysis and membrane separation are thoroughly discussed for the decontamination of water using cnms in addition to this the main process parameters for adsorption and catalysis such as nature of the adsorbent catalyst dosage nature and concentration of pollutants ph temperature time and separation efficiency were also discussed for the application of membrane technology the membrane material the membrane preparation method nature of pollutant water flux and rejection efficiency are discussed in detail this comprehensive review of literature shows that functionalized cnms and their composites showed maximum adsorption higher catalytic degradation of toxic pollutants and increased flux and rejection rate in the membrane separation these modified materials also have reasonable regeneration ability and can be effectively reused without any significant decline in performance for the successful industrial application more studies involving real water samples for a longer period of operating time using cnms materials will be the next logical progression submission declaration the

14142,the search for novel and cost effective material for water treatment is one of the ongoing challenges among the various new materials carbon based nanostructured materials cnms are considered to be the most robust and versatile candidate for the effective treatment of water carbon nanotubes cnts graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo have enticed wide attention and these materials can be used in a variety of applications due to its superior physio chemical properties the cnms and their composites have been employed to develop unique adsorbents novel catalytic materials and high performance membranes with superior permeation properties for the removal of unwanted species from waste water this review article presents a critical assessment of the existing literature on cnts go

sustain life on earth in the recent era contemporary lifestyle demands a higher quantity of freshwater to maintain the standards of living and the increased material consumption produces a large quantity of wastewater which increasingly pollutes the existing fresh water sources in arid and semiarid parts of the world there is a scarcity of water for drinking as well as for agricultural purposes and continued exploitation of non rechargeable water sources creates high environmental stress the progress in membrane technology especially reverse osmosis ro enables to produce a large quantity of freshwater by desalinating the saline water however the population growth and industrial development demand more freshwater requirement or wastewater treatment for beneficial use 1 new technological progress like fracking in oil gas industries requires a large volume of freshwater and subsequent discharge of effluents causing serious threats to the environment 2 thus there is an urgent need of remedying the polluted water thereby solving the environmental concern as well as obtaining the treated water for the possible beneficial use in general the industrial effluent typically contains toxic contaminants such as heavy metals including radioactive elements and synthetic organic compounds such as dyes pharmaceutical derivatives etc 3 5 the heavy metal contaminants are defined as metals having a density greater than 5 g cm3 4 arsenic as cadmium cd chromium cr lead pb and mercury hg are some of the common heavy metals found in the effluent from different industries 6 heavy metal ions are highly soluble in water and if ingested beyond the admissible concentration it may accumulate in the human body resulting in serious health issues which can also lead to fatalities 7 8 another serious source of water pollution is radioactive waste originated from various nuclear reactors and medical facilities around the world 9 the effluent of dye industries is another source of contaminants which are carcinogenic mutagenic or teratogenic 10 11 the metal ions radio nuclei and to some extent dye molecules are persistent therefore these compounds must be removed treated from the effluent before discharging into the environment or for the beneficial use a number of treatment processes are used to remove these harmful species from the effluent water before discharge or beneficial reuse for example adsorption chemical precipitation electrochemical treatment ion exchange membrane separation chlorination and ozonation etc are some of the commonly used methods to remove hazardous materials 6 fig 1 illustrates some of the conventional water treatment technologies and their shortcomings conventional tertiary treatment methods like thermal distillation and reverse osmosis ro are energy intensive processes consequently has high utility operating cost which makes it relatively expensive for widespread usage precipitation and biological treatment can be a simple option for certain water decontamination but it also produces a considerable amount of byproduct namely sludge hence additional sludge disposal process is required the other processes such as chlorination flocculation and coagulation require the addition of chemicals and may produce toxic byproducts 12 the adsorption and membrane technology for water treatment had its concerns about regeneration and fouling in most cases water treatment involves more than one process and the best combination of processes are utilized according to the requirement the need for more than one treatment process is due to the lack of universal technology or economic viability for example wastewater has been effectively treated by reverse osmosis ro process using membranes which should be properly regenerated otherwise membrane fouling happens and the treatment process becomes economically unviable thus it is highly desirable to introduce novel and economic materials for the treatment of newer and intrinsically complex wastewater like produced water 2 the discovery and development of new carbon nanostructured materials cnms can provide a solution to improve these shortcomings 12 the cnms can be described as different allotropes of carbon and comprises of fullerene carbon nanotubes cnts graphene and diamond these are the allotropic forms of carbon in zero one two and three dimensional materials in general cnms have highly robust properties such as high surface area to volume ratio higher adsorption rate superior mechanical strength unique optoelectrical property and small footprints 12 14 consequently cnms materials are extensively studied in the field of adsorption catalysis membrane and composite synthesis sensors electronics energy generation and storage solar and fuel cells etc fig 2 illustrates some of the main applications of cnms due to its unique physio chemical properties cnts graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo are considered as a promising and robust material for wastewater treatment these cnms materials and their composites were widely studied in adsorption catalysis and membrane technology for the removal of organic pollutants and other hazardous contaminants from wastewater effectively 12 15 carbon based materials have also been effectively employed for the treatment of saline water and heavy metals removal in the presence of electric filed through capacitive deionization cdi process generally cdi is a technique implied for separating the charged ions and or hazardous contaminants heavy metals from aqueous solution in the presence of electric field using anode and cathode by applying the potential difference charged ions move in the reverse direction i e anions negatively charged ions travel towards anode positive electrode and cations travel towards cathode hence as a result heavy metals and or na cl ions can be effectively removed from waste and saline water respectively various reports has been published for the preparation of cdi electrodes using go zro2 16 rgo fe3o4 17 cnts sponges 18 activated carbon ac 19 ac fe3o4 nanocomposites 20 as cdi electrodes for waste saline water treatment oladunni et al 21 presented a detailed overview of carbon based cdi electrodes owing to its distinctive properties and thereby diverse applications cnms is one of the actively studied research fields in the last two decades there are review articles available in the literature on heavy metals removal by adsorption using cnt 4 22 and go rgo 23 as a standalone treatment process 24 in addition to this some review articles are also available on cnt and go as catalysis 25 and membrane technology for water treatment 26 27 to the best of our knowledge there is no review article that collectively deals all together with adsorption catalysis and membrane separation for the removal of organic and inorganic contaminants from wastewater using cnts go and rgo in this review the recent advancement in cnms for wastewater treatment is discussed in the field of adsorption catalysis and membrane separation this review also addresses the challenges limitations and future aspects of cnts go and rgo for the feasibility of large scale application in water and wastewater treatment industry though other materials can be included in cnms like biochar carbon dot etc this review restricts to the materials mentioned above due to the limited space to focus more extensively on the published literature reports 2 fundamental aspects of cnms 2 1 carbon nanotubes cnts carbon nanotube cnt is one of the allotropic forms of elemental carbon and its structural form can be considered as elongated fullerenes into the tubular form 14 28 it has a diameter of few nanometers and length of several micrometers and hence called as a nanotube due to its superior mechanical strength and stiffness cnts can be synthesized with the highest length to diameter ratio of 132 000 000 1 which is highest compared to any other material reported 29 in cnts the sp2 hybridized carbon atoms are arranged in a hexagonal pattern similar to that of graphite and exist as a closed cylindrical shape cnts exhibit open end as well as closed end with fullerene caps 30 based on the number of carbon layers cnts can be classified into three main categories namely single walled carbon nanotubes swcnt double walled carbon nanotubes dwcnt and multi walled carbon nanotube mwcnt the morphological aspect of swcnt depicts that it consists of single layer carbon with few nanometer diameter ranges and is relatively curved swcnts exists in metallic and nonmetallic nature therefore they are expected to be useful in miniaturizing electronic devices 31 the dwcnt consists of two carbon layers and shows more chemical resistivity as compared to swcnt the third type is mwcnts which are widely used due to its simplification of the synthesis mwcnts comprise more than two carbon layers having an outer diameter of 3 30 nm and resembles like a concentric tube the morphological structure of single and multi walled cnts are presented in fig 3 cnts are typically synthesized by four leading methods namely laser ablation arc discharge chemical vapor deposition cvd and high pressure carbon monoxide hipco process 32 among these processes cvd and hipco are the most widely used methods for large scale production of cnts however the development of new process and improvements in the existing methods are still in progress for producing cnts socioeconomically on the commercial scale with high purity the fundamental phenomenon operating conditions advantages and disadvantages of these production methods were discussed in the literature 33 due to nanometer scale size the cnts possess unique physio chemical properties such as high aspect ratio large surface area and unique optoelectrical properties cnt and its composites have been effectively used in various applications like energy storage water treatment catalysis electronics biomedical devices food industry and agriculture sector 34 the detailed insight will be discussed in later sections involving separation of toxic pollutants from water using cnts and its composite materials via adsorption catalytic degradation and membrane separation process 2 2 graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo go rgo is a two dimensional 2d nanomaterial of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb structure in go different oxygen based functional groups like carboxyl carbonyl epoxy and hydroxyl are attached to the edges of the go layer resulted in an improved interlayer spacing and hydrophilicity 24 35 on the other hand the oxygenated functional groups of go can be reduced by different chemicals such as hydrazine sodium borohydrate etc and resulted in reduced graphene oxides rgo similar to graphene like sheets exhibiting higher surface area with enhanced adsorption and catalytic active sites fig 4 shows the typical structural illustration and sem images of graphite go and rgo due to ideal plate like structure graphene possesses excellent electrical and thermal conductivity high mechanical strength and consequently considered as a next generation material in electronic devices water treatment and in the energy sector 36 graphene can be prepared by different processes such as mechanical exfoliation chemical reduction of go chemical vapor deposition cvd plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition pecvd and thermal decomposition of organic compounds on selective substrates 37 the large scale preparation of ideal single layer graphene without defects is an ongoing challenge and the synthesis of go and reduced go has progressed tremendously in the last few years the most widely used method for go synthesis is wet chemical oxidation of graphite using strong oxidizing agents like kmno4 though it is cumbersome to clean the residual oxidizing mixture in the go solution this synthetic procedure provides the opportunity to scale up more than a kilogram scale in the laboratory the wet chemical synthesis of go is an economically viable process compared to the preparation of single layer graphene additionally the chemical functional groups present in the go provide further opportunity to modify the existing material according to the requirements therefore more literature reports deal with the applications of go and rgo than single layer pure graphene for water treatment the detailed literature regarding the cnt and graphene synthesis and characterization can be found in the report 32 the following sections present a comprehensive discussion on the application of go rgo as adsorbent catalysts and membrane materials for water treatment 3 adsorption using cnms 3 1 adsorption mechanism adsorption is one of the simple but effective processes for removal of organic and inorganic pollutants from the contaminated water adsorption is the phenomenon of aggregation of fluid gas or liquid on the surface of the adsorbent thus the hazardous contaminants from wastewater can be removed by contacting the effluent with a suitable adsorbent as a result the unwanted toxic materials are attached to the surface of the adsorbent and hence water is treated the adsorption process is demonstrated in terms of adsorption isotherm i e the relationship between the amount of solute adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbents and pressure at equilibrium conditions and is used to envisage the adsorption capacity of the developed materials the contaminant removal efficiency by adsorption depends on various factors like nature of the adsorbate and adsorbent the contact time between the adsorbent and the adsorbate adsorbent dosage and operating conditions such as solution s ph and temperature etc ayawei et al 40 describe several types of adsorption isotherms however langmuir and freundlich isotherms are the frequently used models applicable to homogenous and heterogeneous surfaces respectively langmuir model correlates the adsorption capacity with the initial concentration of adsorbent while freundlich isotherm represents the expression pertaining surface heterogeneity and the exponential distribution of active sites and their energies fig 5 depicts the general mechanism of methylene blue mb dye removal by adsorption process using go here go is used as an adsorbent in the wastewater containing mb it can be seen that after adding the adsorbent mb is adsorbed on the surface of go and the adsorbed mb can be separated along with go as a result treated water is obtained for the economic viability the used adsorbent must be regenerated by a suitable desorption process various methods are employed for the desorption process and depending on the conditions temperature ph change solvent or saline wash can be employed for the adsorbent regeneration purpose furthermore the chemical interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent played a significant role in removing the organic pollutants yang and xing 41 reported the five possible chemical interactions responsible for the removal of dye molecules and heavy metals on the surface of carbon based materials in nanoscale the important interactions including hydrophobic effect π π bonds hydrogen bonds covalent bond and electrostatic interactions the following section will discuss the recent literature reports dwelling adsorption process for water treatment using cnts and go rgo 3 2 cnt based adsorbent a variety of adsorbents such as activated carbon fly ash peat biomass and biomaterials like alginate chitosan etc have been used for the removal of heavy metals dyes and organic traces 4 however it was reported in the literature that these materials have either low adsorption capacities removal efficiencies or difficulties in regeneration 4 thus there is a search for developing a new adsorbent material which possesses higher adsorption capacity and easy regeneration for the effective treatment of wastewater for this reason cnts and its composites were studied and the effect of operating parameters has been reported in the literature 42 45 adsorption property of cnts strongly depends on the type of cnts presence of various functional groups 46 the impregnation of additives like metal oxides or polymers composites 47 nature of contaminants and operating parameters such as ph temperature and contact time between adsorbent and adsorbate table 1 summarizes the overview for the removal of various pollutants like heavy metals dyes and radioactive materials from aqueous solution using cnts and its composites as reported recently one of the most widely studied chemical compounds for the adsorption process using cnt is dye molecules and in most cases methylene blue mb was used as the model compound most of the dye molecules possess conjugated aromatic groups which can have π π interaction and nonpolar interaction with cnt surface it was also reported that the oxidized cnt material could be easily regenerated by using naoh solution and can be effectively reused in an interesting study 50 malachite green mg was efficiently removed by incorporating cnts with zeolitic imidazolate frameworks zif 8 the mg removal rate was almost twice by using the cnt hybrid material as compared to pure zif 8 alone the adsorption capacity of zif 8 hybrid was 2034 mg g while that of pure zif 8 was 1667 mg g it was also observed that 55 removal of mg was achieved by using pure zif 8 and hybrid zif 8 showed the much improved removal of 95 at the adsorbent dosage of 0 2 g l thus comparatively improved adsorption efficiency of mg was achieved by using cnt hybrid material than pure zif 8 this hybrid material has been regenerated by ethanol washing and can be reused up to 4 cycles without having any significant decline in performance the improved adsorption capacity of composite materials is attributed to the synergistic effect of covalent bonding between the parent and impregnated materials resulting in an attachment of various functional groups on the surface of cnts go rgo and exhibits improved specific surface area ssa hydrophilicity and electrostatic repulsion similarly other dye molecules like methyl orange mo tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa direct red 80 dr 80 basic red 46 br 46 chlorophenol cp and congo red cr were examined using different types of cnt based adsorbents as reported in the literature 42 51 48 52 53 a highly efficient functionalized cnt adsorbent material was developed by using 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes through the co condensation method and loaded with commercial tio2 42 the adsorption performance of the material was measured for the mo removal from aqueous solution it was found that 0 1 g l of adsorbent dosage completely remove the dye molecule within 30 min at an operating temperature of 25 c which corresponds to the maximum mo removal of 42 85 mg g an mwcnt stabilized cu2o nanoparticles pvp cnts cu2o were also reported for the adsorption of mg dye and tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa 51 this hybrid adsorbent exhibits excellent performance compared to pristine mwcnt for the removal of organic dye and tbbpa because of the synergistic properties of inorganic species and polymer the adsorption capacities for mg and tbbpa were 1495 46 and 116 72 mg g respectively by using pvp cnts cu2o which is much higher as compared to pure cnts 417 58 and 68 03 mg g in one of the recent report 48 mwcnt was oxidized to obtain cooh groups and embedded with magnetic nanoparticles of iron oxide mnps to develop the unique magnetic adsorbents embedded in gelatin bead matrix the proposed adsorbent was then tested for the removal of anionic dr 80 and cationic mb dye molecules it was found that the developed material exhibits comparatively higher adsorption efficiency of 96 1 for anionic dye dr than the cationic dye mb furthermore the effect of chemical modifications was also thoroughly investigated by developing three kind of adsorbents i e gel gel cnt and gel cnt mnps and observed that nanocomposite beads adsorbed 63 0 69 6 and 93 1 of anionic dye while only 17 9 64 2 and 76 1 of cationic dye respectively in general the opposite charge attaracts each other hence positively charged nanocomposite material has pronounced effect on negatively charged pollutant molecule vice versa this novel adsorbent showed remarkable performance in removing the ionic dyes and can be easily separated from the treated solution using magnetic field however no recycling experiments were reported for this material recently iron oxide magnetic mwcnts coated with calcium mmc was studied for the removal of humic acid ha 61 in this study the effect of exposure time and ph of the solution was explored it was reported that a maximum of 90 removal efficiency of ha was obtained using mmc with ha initial concentration and dosage of 20 mg l and 0 5 g l respectively at ph of 7 0 0 2 for a reaction time of 30 min it was further observed that the ph of the feed solution has no major impact on efficiency the mmc was regenerated through pre ultrasonic microwave technology and was effectively reused more than five cycles of regeneration as mmc offers higher ha removal than without calcium coated cnts because of the interaction of mmc and ha with metal cations ca2 by bridging and ligand phenomenon in another study 52 single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts carboxyl functionalized single walled carbon nanotubes swcnt cooh graphene g and graphene oxide go were used as alternative adsorbents for the removal of cationic dye br 46 from aqueous solution it was found that all the above mentioned materials can be used for the removal of br 46 by increasing contact time the removal of br 46 increases and reached equilibrium after 80 min for swcnts swcnt cooh and 90 min for g and go remarkable adsorption capacity of 110 and 140 mg g was achieved for br 46 by using swcnt and swcnt cooh respectively at equilibrium conditions when the initial concentration of pollutant was 60 mg l and adsorbent dosage was 0 05 g l nevertheless the separation of adsorbents was done by centrifuging and there was no adsorbent regeneration and recycling reported the removal of chlorophenol cp using mwcnts has also been reported for this carbon nanotube cnt hybridized with psf and polymer beads were fabricated via the phase inversion method 53 it was reported that enhanced cp adsorption was achieved by using hybrid polymer beads as compared to pure polymer or mwcnt the maximum adsorption capacity of 119 5 mg g was obtained by using 2 5 g l of hybrid adsorbent at 100 mg l initial concentration of cp it can be inferred from these results that composites of cnts exhibit better adsorption capacity for the organic molecules compared without cnts additionally the material in beads shape is advantageous for the separation of adsorbent yet the effectiveness of recycling experiments has not been reported recently chavoshan et al 62 compared the adsorption efficiency of single walled and multi walled carbon nanotubes for the removal of penicillin g from aqueous solution it was reported that swcnt exhibits relatively higher adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of 141 mg g and 68 25 as compared to mwcnts 119 mg g and 56 37 respectively for the same experimental conditions of 0 8 g l dosage and 50 mg l initial concentration of penicillin g solution a hybrid of mwcnt with polyamidoamine pamam 54 and amide group functionalized multi walled carbon nanotube embedded in hydroxyapatite sodium alginate matrix 55 were synthesized for the removal of co ii it was observed that 0 03 g l of pamam mwcnt composite could remove about 83 of co ii ions having the initial concentration of 100 mg l at 25 c the mwcnt hydroxyapatite sodium alginate hybrids were capable of removing co ii up to 347 8 mg g at the optimized condition the pamam cnt hybrid was also employed for ni as and zn removal and exhibiting separation efficiency of 98 88 and 86 respectively under the same process parameters and adsorption dosage 54 in another study lead pb was removed using melamine paraformaldehyde and various alkyl diamines based polyamine cnt cnt pa 57 and benzene 1 3 5 triamine paraformaldehyde and various alkyl diamines based polyamine cnt composites cnt tri 63 while for hg ii removal amidoamine functionalized multi walled carbon nanotubes mmcnt aa 59 was used at ambient temperature it was claimed that the adsorption capacity about 90 mg g was achieved and the developed material is highly selective for the mercury ions in the presence of other ions like cadmium magnesium calcium sodium etc present it was reported that it could be reused more than five cycles with 0 05 m edta washing for the regeneration in another study almost 99 of bismuth bi was removed from the aqueous solution of 30 mg l initial concentration by contacting it with 1 g l mwcnt in 30 min at 20 c 60 though the use of cnts as such provide the adsorption however the separation of cnt nanomaterial is challenging one and hence the hybridization with a polymer or magnetic particle will facilitate easy separation from the literature reports it can be summarized that cnts and its hybrids can effectively remove the metal ions from water the study of fundamental aspects of adsorption proves that it is possible to utilize cnts based materials for pollutant removal however the issue of recycling and regeneration studies will be further established to apply this new material in large scale there were few reports where cnts were imbedded in the polymer matrix as stable beads form 53 but the lack of recycling experiments makes it harder to understand the system for large scale applicability on the other hand there were many recycling experiments for the adsorption study but the adsorbents were found to be fine powder form and the recycling was done by centrifuge or filtration these recycling methods are not the preferred choice for large scale water treatment plants 3 3 go and rgo as an adsorbent the combination of high surface area the presence of oxygen based functional groups nonpolar interaction number of structural defects point line and void defects and π π interactions in go rgo make it one of the important adsorbents developed recently for the removal of the toxic contaminants in wastewater 64 68 eigler and feicht 62 briefly discussed various types of defects observed in go and its inferences as a structural motive there are two major types of defects namely in plane functionalized defects and out plane lattice defects which can be controlled and used as a structural motif for various applications the defects in the go rgo based materials drastically enhances the adsorption capacity because of the heavy metal ions agility through the newly created voids in a recent study gupta and khatri 69 investigated the effect of rgo on the removal of mg from aqueous solution it was found that by adding rgo 0 05 g l into 100 ml aqueous solution of mg 200 mg l the dye was completely adsorbed within 30 min of contact time the remarkable dye removal is due to the high surface area of rgo along with the strong interactions between the aromatic ring of mg and negatively charged functionalized rgo fig 6 a b illustrates the effect of ph on the removal efficiency of mg and sem image of rgo respectively it has also been reported that ph had a direct relation with mg removal i e by increasing the ph of the solution into mildly basic ph the adsorption kinetics has been increased from sem images of rgo it was found that rgo has voids which enhances the adsorption and thus 100 mg removal was achieved within 30 min at ph 7 or higher recently different kinds of adsorbent namely graphene oxide go silica sio2 and tin oxide sno2 have been synthesized and tested for zinc removal under different ph conditions it was found that go exhibits higher adsorption capacity of 243 mg g as compared to sio2 9 1 mg g and sno2 102 mg g interestingly by varying the ph zn2 adsorption mechanism on go surface varies more precisely zn2 explicitly governed by inner sphere and outer sphere surface mechanism at high and low ph respectively 67 go can also be embedded in biopolymers or magnetic nanoparticles to improve the easy separation of adsorbent after the target molecule removal for example mb removal from wastewater was reported using go and chitosan coated with iron oxide which removes 98 mb from aqueous solution 70 in comparison with go chitin nanofibrils which removes 90 for three cycles 71 in order to comparatively analyze the performance of cnts and go abdi et al 50 synthesized composites of zif 8 with cnt and go it was claimed that the nanocomposite made of zif with go revealed higher adsorption capacity of 3300 mg g as compared to zif cnt nanohybrid hence go rgo offers certain advantages over cnts additionally go cd β cyclodextrin and cufe2o4 rgo was also investigated for the removal of bpa 72 and cr 73 respectively these reports claimed that a maximum of 373 4 mg g bpa was adsorbed while for cr 81 mg g of removal was achieved using rgo composites and six recycling experiments were demonstrated with remaining adsorption capacity of about 90 the use of go rgo was also reported for the toxic contaminants from aqueous solution and some of the recent studies reported for the removal of heavy metals are presented in table 2 it was claimed that maximum adsorption capacity of 502 5 mg g of cr vi was achieved by using pmpd rgo nfo poly m phenylenediamine reduced graphene oxide nickel ferrite as an adsorbent 74 while for cu ii and pb ii removal the tartaric acid modified graphene oxide go ta was reported to be the better adsorbent with maximum adsorption capacities of 374 53 mg g 1 and 125 63 mg g 1 respectively and modified go showed improved adsorption compared to pristine go 75 in addition to this pb ii and co ii removal were also reported using go rgo hybrids compared to other adsorbents as listed in table 2 it can be inferred that up to 99 25 and 90 1 of pb ii and co ii was removed from aqueous solution using go hpei hyper branched polyethyleneimines 76 and zno nano rod rgo 77 as an adsorbent some other heavy metals radioactive elements such as sr ii cd ii and u vi were also removed by using go rgo based adsorbents the process parameters and adsorption performance were highlighted in table 2 in general compared to cnts the go rgo has better adsorption capacity and removal efficiency and this could be due to its versatility in terms of functional group present easy dispersion and better dispersion in the composite materials 4 catalytic degradation using cnms 4 1 catalytic degradation approach for pollutants removal the toxic pollutants can been effectively removed from wastewater using adsorption however the treatment ends up with the formation of the secondary waste product which cannot be processed again and should be dumped as such hazardous organic pollutants present in water can be effectively degraded catalytically by advanced oxidation process aop using nanostructured carbon materials in this process reactive hydroxyl radicals oh are generated which are highly oxidative towards organic molecules present in water and hence resulted in the decomposition of the toxic contaminants 88 interestingly catalytic degradation has advantage over adsorption as it encompasses the decomposition of organic materials even at low concentration ppb level without producing any secondary pollutant 89 fig 7 schematically illustrates the mechanistic aspect of catalytic degradation of dye molecule using ag zno mwcnt composite as an example in this instance it was proposed that the combination of zno photoexcitation and subsequent charge transfer to ag cnt surface creates superoxide radicals o2 by reacting with oxygen the superoxide radicals o2 reacts with the water molecule and produces the oh radicals which decompose the dye molecules by oxidative degradation the aop is considered to be the most efficient water treatment process as compared to other conventional processes as it can also be operated by sunlight rather than using uv or in the presence of visible mercury light sources etc depending upon the presence or absence of light source during the degradation process aop is broadly classified into two main types namely photochemical aop and non photochemical aop respectively ozonation wet peroxide ozonation o3 h2o2 catalytic ozonation and fenton based wet peroxidation h2o2 fe2 are the sub categories of non photochemical aop it was reported that non photochemical aop could not completely decompose the organic contaminants and to overcome this shortcoming photochemical aop has been preferred in recent times for the decontamination of wastewater 90 some of the most widely studied photochemical aops include o3 h2o2 uv photo fenton reaction and photocatalytic reaction uv tio2 in a recent report 91 the meticulous mechanism of all the subclasses of aops was discussed in detail specifically cnts and go has been employed for the removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs which otherwise cause serious health issues such as cancerous tumors birth defects obesity diabetes and fertility problems 92 fu et al 93 synthesized titania go tgo nanocomposite for the degradation of edcs and reported that tgo exhibits higher phenolic degradation as compared to pristine go and titania in general the hybrid nanomaterials enhances the degradation process and thus effectively treated the wastewater by a physical chemical and biological process the following section presents recent literature reports of nanomaterials and their composites of cnts go and rgo for catalytic degradation pollutants present in the wastewater 4 2 catalytic degradation of organic contaminants using cnts cnts have been employed as an effective means of degrading organic contaminants from wastewater by conventional chemical aop or photocatalytic degradation process 94 97 in a recent study 98 aluminum silicate multi walled carbon nanotube composite was coated with ferrocene groups si al fe mwcnt for oxidative decomposition and de colorization of methyl orange mo methyl blue mb orange g og and acid orange 7 ao7 the key process controlling parameters such as ph reaction time initial h2o2 concentration catalyst loading and temperature of the reaction were also investigated recently azzam et al 95 synthesized cnts tio2 agnps surfactant nanocomposites for photocatalytic degradation of mb it was claimed that the incorporation of cnts enhances the surface and electronic properties of tio2 while agnps improves the stability of the developed catalyst by reducing the reclamation of electron hole pair resulted in lower bandgap energy 2 25 ev larger surface area and higher catalytic degradation of mb tio2 coated mwcnt also reported for the photocatalytic disinfection of bacterial endospores 99 it was observed that the oh radical generated due to the heterogeneous fenton like oxidation was responsible for the decomposition of dye molecules by using si al fe mwcnts alone without h2o2 the maximum removal efficiency of ao7 og mb and mo were 32 9 63 7 75 6 and 99 9 respectively was observed for the exposure time of 140 min however the addition of h2o2 completely removes the mo mb og and ao7 in 6 10 12 and 30 min respectively this might be due to more oh radical generation because of the addition of h2o2 which were responsible for the decomposition of dye molecules it was further claimed that this novel catalyst si al fe mwcnt was highly stable and can decompose toxic dyes effectively for more than seven cycles of fenton type oxidation without decreasing the degradation efficiency in another report 100 a novel catalytic degradation process using microwave induced carbon nanotubes mw cnts as the catalyst was introduced for the removal of organic pollutants from aqueous solution the experimental studies were carried out to analyze the effect of mwcnt size diameter on the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants the diameter of cnts is in the range of 10 20 nm 20 40 nm and 40 60 nm for the catalytic degradation of organic contaminants it was suggested that by using 10 20 nm cnts 100 degradation of mo was obtained in just 7 min for the solution having the initial concentration of 25 mg l and 1 2 g l of catalyst dosage for the synthesis microwaves with a power of 450 w and 2450 mhz frequency were applied the catalyst was recycled five times and each cycle the efficiency of catalyst degraded considerably the use of high amount cnts for the removal of a small quantity of dye molecules the system may not be cost effective for the large scale setup and maybe the adsorption process competing with the degradation process in this particular system in addition to this some other organic dye molecules were also investigated under the optimum conditions and it was claimed that mwcnt could be an effective treatment process for the removal of organic dyes from aqueous solution the rate constants k for the degradation of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs methylene blue mb methyl parathion mp methyl orange mo and bisphenol a bpa using 10 20 nm mw cnts process were 0 726 0 679 0 463 0 334 and 0 168 min 1 respectively it was hypothesized that smaller diameter of cnt resulted in an increased surface area hence the degradation of organic compounds was more for smaller diameter catalyst as compared to the bigger one in this particular study the catalyst used for the degradation is almost five times compared to the molecule decomposed which is very high and unusual for catalytic processes tio2 nanoparticle is considered to be one of the most effective photocatalysts for the degradation of organic molecules 101 consequently the combination of mwcnts and tio2 composite for the degradation of the organic pollutants were reported 102 it was found that at a very low addition of mwcnts 0 6 wt to tio2 nanoparticles 4 chlorophenol was completely degraded in two hours at 365 nm irradiation this might be due to the presence of mwcnt which act as an electron sink thereby facilitating better charge separation in addition to the photochemical process organic pollutants can also be degraded sonochemically recently a novel sonocatalytic nanocomposite of sno2 mwcnt was synthesized by the sol gel process in the autoclave followed by thermal annealing the sno2 mwcnt hybrid was investigated for decomposition of mb dye molecules as a model solution 103 it was reported that sno2 mwcnt nanocomposite completely decomposed the mb dye with a higher reaction rate as compared to pure sno2 or a simple physical mixture of sno2 and mwcnt it was hypothesized that the efficient utilization of light emitted during bubble collapse and better separation of electron hole pairs as well as the transfer of electrons from sno2 to mwcnt were the reasons for an effective decomposition of the dye molecule cnt based nano photocatalytic material was synthesized using the co precipitation decomposition method it was observed that the addition of 5 wt mwcnt to ag zno cnt could produce superior photocatalytic activity 100 removal of ao7 as compared to ag zno alone 87 removal under visible light 88 the presence of mwcnt facilitated better electron hole separation hence exhibits better catalytic degradation compared to catalyst without mwcnt various parameters like ph amount of photocatalyst and dye concentration on photodegradation of dye molecules were studied the initial concentration of the solution and the catalyst dosage was set to be 20 mg l and 1 g l respectively for the reaction time of 2 h importantly the synthesized catalyst showed better reusability for the recycling experiments a detailed mechanistic approach is presented for the degradation of ao7 using ag zno cnt nano photocatalyst as shown in fig 7 similarly graphene based mno2 has been impregnated on cnts by varying the calcination temperature and used for the catalytic degradation of basic red 18 br18 it was reported that by increasing the calcination temperature from 400 to 600 c the porosity of the developed material reduces significantly furthermore the developed material can easily be recycled and showed superior regeneration performance by effectively decolorizing rb18 dye 96 recently the magnetic nanohybrid material was synthesized using polypyrrole cnts cofe2o4 cnts cofe2o4 ppy for the degradation of anionic and cationic dyes 104 the high catalytic performance excellent adsorption and greater stability of this unique material make it a promising candidate for water treatment it was concluded that 1 g l dosage of cnts cofe2o4 ppy and 4 mmol l of peroxymonosulfate pms could completely decompose mb having an initial concentration of 50 mg l in 30 min the catalyst was magnetically separated and reused for five times by freshly adding pms for the mb degradation by the oxidation process in addition to dyes several plasticizers such as diethyl phthalate dep used in polymer industries have been categorized as an endocrine disruptor therefore if such molecules were present in water these should be degraded before discharging into the ecological systems in one such study 105 copper ferrite decorated multi walled carbon nanotubes magnetic nanoparticles cufe2o4 mwcnts mnps were introduced for the degradation of dep using persulfate ps in comparison with mwcnts and cufe2o4 the above mentioned mnps drastically decomposed dep at ambient temperature and can be recycled up to 5 times without a noticeable decrease in performance it can be summarized that the addition of metal oxide and other composites of cnts improves the catalytic performance and hence significantly degrades toxic contaminants from aqueous solution most of the catalytic degradation studies have been performed using dye molecules as the model compound and further research work should be carried out to synthesize novel hybrid metal oxide cnt nanocomposites and examined for the variety of other pollutants to have the broader application of this new material 4 3 go rgo as catalysts in water treatment go rgo and their composites have been reported widely as one of the promising nanocatalysts for degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater the catalytic degradation was carried out similar to cnts by incorporating semiconductor nanomaterials into the graphene layer for degrading organic molecules 106 go rgo and their combination with different metal oxides were used as a photocatalyst electrocatalyst and fenton based catalyst for the effective oxidation of organic contaminants in wastewater treatment 107 109 this section summarizes various go rgo based nano catalytic materials for the decomposition of toxic organic pollutants reported in the latest literature mohamed et al 110 reported the synthesis of manganese ferrite graphene hybrid photocatalyst using sol gel process a nano spindle structure with monomodal mesopore type of material was synthesized by using 91 wt of go and 9 wt of mnfe2o4 the resulted material was tested for the photocatalytic degradation of mb in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation it was claimed that 1 g l of this material completely degrades mb initial concentration of 10 mg l in 30 min with a rate constant of 0 037 min 1 similarly cadmium based nanocatalyst cds rgo was prepared by using a one step gamma ray radiation induced reduction method 111 this catalyst was tested for the degradation of rhodamine b rh b and almost 93 removal efficiency under visible light irradiation was reported in another study 112 nanocomposites of tio2 cds rgo were synthesized by the solvothermal method and tested as a photocatalytic material for the removal of organic pollutants it was observed that tio2 cds rgo has a higher surface area of 109 7 m2 g as compared to tio2 cds 67 m2 g and cds 53 m2 g due to the higher surface area the photocatalytic reaction showed faster decomposition compared to catalyst without go the results indicated that this hybrid material could decompose mb and rh b up to 97 5 and 93 5 respectively in just 20 min using visible light irradiation for comparison the degradation of mb with tio2 cds rgo tio2 cds and cds alone reached 97 5 94 0 and 78 5 respectively in 20 min reaction time at the same condition the degradation rate of rhb reached 93 5 87 5 and 74 8 respectively which demonstrated the synergetic role of graphene oxide for the catalyst a unique magnetic nanocomposite consisting of cufe2o4 go was synthesized by the hydrothermal method for the decomposition of dyes 113 various experimental parameters like ph the dosage of catalyst initial dye concentration were studied and a maximum decomposition of 95 was achieved at the dosage of 0 8 g l in 50 min the reported nanocatalyst has been effective in dyes degradation in the presence of visible light and it was easily recyclable using magnetic separation additionally it was reused up to 5 cycles without any noticeable decrease in catalytic performance the detailed mechanistic study using scavengers revealed that o2 and hole h radicals were responsible for dye degradation the schematic photocatalytic degradation mechanism is shown in fig 8 in another study 114 flower like tio2 sphere fts reduced graphene oxide was proposed for the catalytic degradation of rh b and trichloroethylene tce it was reported that about 95 and 80 removal of rh b and tce was achieved under the simulated solar light the recycled catalyst showed no decrease in catalytic activity up to four cycles recently 115 au was decorated on tio2 and tio2 on rgo to enhance the surface area and photocatalytic degradation process acid blue ab 92 was used as the model compound and the uv vis light was used for the photocatalytic decomposition of dye molecules it was reported that the incorporation of graphene and au nanoparticles to tio2 enhances the surface area reduces the crystalline size thus more effectively degrade the ab 92 molecule from aqueous solution as compared to pure tio2 the simple modification of tio2 with rgo has also been reported 116 in this case rgo tio2 84 wt tio2 nano hybrid was synthesized by the spray drying process and was compared with pure tio2 for removal of mb it was found that 92 and 71 decomposition efficiency of mb was achieved using rgo tio2 and pure tio2 respectively it was hypothesized that this might be because of change in charge recombination due to the presence of rgo which promotes the electron hole separation for degrading the dye a similar type of nano composites made of rgo and tio2 was also prepared by direct sol gel and hydrothermal process and tested for mb degradation using uv light irradiation 117 a maximum of 93 and 82 of mb separation was achieved with 1 9 of rgo to tio2 prepared by sol gel and hydrothermal processes respectively an electro catalytic nitrogen doped graphene aerogel ngas were proposed recently for the treatment of bpa from synthetic wastewater 118 the newly developed material was also compared with commercially available carbon electrodes it was claimed that the ngas showed better electrochemical activity and can efficiently treat wastewater containing bpa than the previously existed commercial materials more than 90 removal of bpa 15 mg l initial concentration was achieved in 30 min by using ngas a detailed analysis of degradation products showed that the oh radicals by water electrolysis were the reason for the decomposition of bpa it was also stated that these materials could be used for more than fifty cycles of treatment with the negligible change in catalytic performance recently extensive research was carried out by combining rgo with different metal oxide materials for wastewater treatment rgo composites were synthesized in combination with ag 119 tio2 cds 120 biocl 121 ceo2 122 agbr ag n 123 wmz ws2 nanosheet mg doped zno 124 graphite oxide gox 125 zno nanorod 77 and bipo4 126 etc the effective degradation of the pollutant molecule depends on the efficient charge transfer behavior of metal incorporated for example the incorporation of cds tio2 on go sheets enhances the catalytic degradation efficiency of mb this is because of the reason that the cds act as an electron donor in tio2 while go acts as an electron acceptor and adsorber for effective decomposition of organic contaminants under visible light irradiation the developed material gets excited and cds produces negative and positive charge particles the generated electrons and holes reacts with the oxygen molecule and hydroxyl ion of aqueous solution resulting in oxygen peroxide radicals o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh respectively that will effectively decompose the dye molecules present in the aqueous solution 120 similarly the impregnation of biocl and ceo2 over go improves the electron transfer ability and enhances the degradation properties of hybrid materials like wisely the catalytic performance of the mg doped zno rgo was improved by introducing ws2 nanosheets attributed to defects formation and efficient electron hole separation 124 table 3 depicts the degradation reaction details regarding the treatment of a number of pollutants by various go rgo catalysts reported in the literature last three years the table contains the main operating parameters such as nature of the catalytic material amount of dosage type and concentration of pollutant reaction conditions reaction time reaction rate and removal efficiency invariably in each specific case higher decomposition of dyes and other toxic pollutants were achieved by using go rgo coated with metal oxides and their composites as compared to the pure catalyst this might be due to the higher surface area avoiding charge recombination for electron hole separation specific crystal structure and promoting radical generation oh and so4 etc it was claimed that almost 100 removal efficiency of hazardous pollutants could be obtained by using hybrid nano composites 93 112 119 123 124 127 134 in addition to this a variety of novel catalytic materials consisting of go rgo were prepared and studied for the degradation of rhb 77 122 124 125 135 in case of rh b the rgowmz was the most effective catalysts for degradation of rh b and within 5 min complete decomposition was observed under sunlight 124 nitrogen doped graphene oxide and its composites were also synthesized in the recent years and tested for the removal of pollutants like bpa 118 smx sulfamethoxazole 128 mb 130 oa 131 136 2 cp 123 rh 6 g 137 and rh b 77 etc these non metallic nanostructured materials such as ndg nitrogen doped graphene ngas nitrogen doped graphene aerogels and nghs nitrogen doped graphene hydrogels significantly reduced the water contaminants and can be further studied for the better understanding to treat industrial effluents containing hazardous pollutants for example fe fe3c nanoparticles loaded on fe n doped graphene showed consistent catalytic degradation for more than 13 cycles with an efficiency of about 95 removal 137 in summary it can be inferred that go rgo and their composites could be an alternative catalytic materials for an effective and efficient degradation of toxic contaminants in most cases oxidative decomposition of organic molecules was done in the case of hybrid materials the charge transfer mechanism is the predominant pathway for catalytic degradation as the natural progression the toxic effect of residual nanocatalyst present in the discharged water and large scale synthesis of the catalyst has to be done and the use of real wastewater samples are necessary 5 membrane technology based on cnms 5 1 basic principles of membrane for water treatment membrane technology is one of the preferred choices for the water desalination and wastewater treatment due to its modular approach and high purity of treated water at a reasonable cost a membrane is a barrier which allows specific species to pass through while blocking the flow of other species 2 membranes are broadly based on two main families of materials namely polymeric and inorganic membranes both of these membranes have advantages and limitations by taking advantages from each two organic inorganic hybrid membrane with improved performance can also be developed 140 the membrane processes separate water from heavy metals dyes salts and ultra fine particles including biological species like bacteria s and viruses etc the basic principle of membrane process and its applications are elaborately discussed in these references 141 142 in water treatment processes on the basis of membrane pore size membrane separation processes are classified into four main types namely microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro the pore size in the selective layer decreases from mf to ro as shown in fig 9 a consequently the resistance for the passage of aqueous media increases from bigger pore size to smaller pore an overview of membrane separation processes on the basis of pore size and passage and the rejection of solutes is also shown schematically in fig 9 a it can be seen that suspended solids and bacteria s are blocked by all four types of membranes however the diameter of the virus is less than that of the mf membrane pore size so virus and similar size particulate matters could be pass through from the mf membrane while it can be blocked by the other three types of membrane furthermore it can be evident from fig 9 a that for the separation of multivalent ions nf or ro membranes should be used because mf and uf have the bigger pore size hence the inability to block these species for the separation of very small molecules such as monovalent ions only ro can be used thus the selection of membrane depends on the nature of species removal although ro is considered to be the most suitable membrane for the separation of small sized contaminant like monovalent ions it also offers more resistance to the flow of treated fluid water due to the nature of selective layer where molecular passage is by diffusion process fick s law whereas mf and uf are based on size exclusion pore flow mechanism darcy s law nf membrane is considered in between these two processes besides many advantages membrane technology has also some limitations such as fouling or pore blockage thereby lowering the water flux the issue of fouling reduction can be improved up to certain level by using a variety of new material such as cnms and its composites because of their incredible chemical inertness high surface area and mechanical and thermal stability the incorporation of cnts go into polymeric membranes remarkably improves the antifouling behavior of the nanocomposite membranes by reducing the surface roughness enhancing the rejection efficiency and increasing the hydrophilicity 143 the composite nature of cnms and polymer synergistically enhance the performance of membrane compared to the pure polymer membrane due the presence of cnms the above mentioned superior properties of cnms were reinforcing the polymeric composite membrane by physicochemical interaction cheng et al 144 impregnated go and pvp on pvdf based ultrafiltration membrane and reported that the developed membrane showed higher water flux and effluent rejection performance compared to pristine pvdf membrane the increase in permeability and anti fouling resistance of hybrid membrane is because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between go and pvp vatanpour et al 145 compared the pristine polyethersulfone pes membrane with 0 04 wt mwcnts incorporated pes membrane and claimed that the mwcnt pes offers lowest fouling ratio of 12 than pristine pes membrane 70 fig 9 b presents the schematic of water penetration pathways through vertically aligned va cnts modified polymeric membranes cnt modified membranes enhances the water flux 3 4 times as compared to unmodified membrane because of the water transport between the nano confinement and through va cnt pores 146 the following sections provide an overview of the existing latest literature on cnms membranes using cnts go rgo and their composites for water treatment applications 5 2 cnt based membranes based on its high aspect ratios smooth hydrophobic walls specially aligned atoms and inner pore diameter cnts could be an attractive material in advanced membrane technologies for water treatment it was reported that enhanced flux up to 4 5 times were obtained using aligned cnts based membrane compared to other conventional membranes 148 theoretically ideal aligned cnt membrane offers almost frictionless water flow inside the core of the tube and excellent retention based on the tube diameter cnt based membranes can be generally classified into two types i e vertically aligned va and mixed matrix mm cnt membranes va can be synthesized by organizing cnts perpendicularly with supportive filler materials while the development of mm cnt membrane is a simple and cost effective process the mm cnt membrane also showed enhanced water flux compared to existing membranes limitations and shortcomings of some conventional membranes such as fouling irregular pore size pore blocking and regeneration could be improved using mm cnt membranes and its composites the mm cnt membranes can also be used to increase water permeability solutes rejection and mechanical strength table 4 summarizes the detailed literature reports on cnt based membranes and its composites for wastewater treatment applications for the last three years the following section discusses in detail a few selective examples the nitrogen doped cnt composite membrane was synthesized using nanoporous anodic aluminum membranes naams by a chemical vapor deposition process it was observed that the most efficient n doped cnt composite was achieved by combining carbon and nitrogen in a ratio of 5 to 1 the performance of this novel material is measured in terms of ionic dye molecules separation it was proposed that the n doped cnt membranes can also be used in catalysis molecular separation and sensing applications as well 149 apart from nitrogen doping cnt based membranes can also be doped with different functionalities like biocide catalyst etc for the water treatment process in one such study 150 silver doped cnt membrane was developed by a wet chemical process for the removal of bacteria in wastewater it was observed that 10 of ag doped cnt based membrane was the optimum condition for removing nearly 100 bacteria these types of membranes are more suitable for the removal of various water born infectious species recently sandwich like cnt hollow fiber membranes hfm were developed by the wet air method for the removal of microcystin lr a toxin produced by cyanobacteria from wastewater by electrochemical degradation 151 it was found that 99 8 of separation efficiency was achieved thus cnt hfm was demonstrated for the removal of microcystin lr with excellent regeneration capacity by the electrochemical process a new cnt based membrane for hemodialysis was also attempted by using polyethersulfone pes and its composites with mwcnt by phase inversion method 152 the subsequent membrane was tested for the rejection of bovine serum albumin bsa it was observed that 98 bsa rejection was achieved with 150 lmh of water flux by using pes poly citric acid g mwcnt membrane as compared to pure pes membrane which had the water flux of 22 57 lmh and 86 bsa rejection the blood dialysis study and protein rejection coupled with high flux demonstrated the superiority of the cnt hybrid membrane compared to pure pes membrane in another study the chromate ions removal was reported using pes supported fe ag functionalized mwcnt 153 the oxidized mwcnt was used for the tethering of fe ag nanoparticles by microwave assisted polyol method and subsequently dispersed in pes followed by phase inversion method it was reported that 1 fe ag fmwcnts addition in pes has the highest water flux of 36 9 lmh with 94 8 chromate ions removal by donnan exclusion principle and pure pes membrane showed negligible chromate ion removal with inferior flux a recent report states that almost 90 of zn removal was feasible by using oxygen functionalized mwcnts by argon o2 plasma treatment deposited on the hollow fiber membrane surface 154 in addition to this thin film nanocomposite tfn nanofiltration membranes were prepared using sulfonated mwcnt 155 and polypyrrole ppy oxidized mwcnts 156 both the material showed 96 8 and 97 9 na2so4 rejection with water flux of 13 2 lmh and 96 6 lmh respectively which were superior to the simple tfc films and the fouling resistance showed much improvement due to the presence of hydrophilized cnts zno tethered mwcnt nanofiltration pes membrane was also demonstrated for the dye removal 157 mechanically improved mwcnt biopolymer buckypaper membrane was also prepared using common biopolymers like chitosan gellan gum etc and the resulted membrane showed the effective separation of trace organic contaminants and inorganic solutes 158 fig 10 a b represents the schematic of cnt and go doped membrane for heavy metal and dyes removal respectively in another study it was reported that polypropylene pp based membranes were synthesized with and without carbon nanotube immobilization 159 the developed membranes were tested for direct contact membrane distillation dcmd with the initial salt concentration of 10 000 mg l it was found that 99 9 of salt rejection was achieved with 36 8 lmh of water vapor flux the flux was almost 52 higher for cnt composite membrane than unmodified pp membrane thus from the discussed results it is clear that the composites of cnms improve the membrane flux and rejection compared to the pure polymeric membrane and these hybrid membranes could be promising materials for removing hazardous and toxic residues from wastewater with enhanced water flux and minimal fouling 5 3 go and rgo based membranes in recent years go rgo has attracted more focus compared to cnts for the membrane preparation and demonstrated high separation capacity of various hazardous and toxic contaminants this widespread attention is because of its exceptional hydrophilic surface characteristics and well organized 2d nanofluidic channels for molecular transport 162 164 this section describes selective recent literature reports of go rgo and its composites as membrane materials for water purification the hybrid nafion nanocomposite membrane was synthesized by the solvent casting method using a variety of fillers such as anatase type tio2 nanoparticles graphene oxide go and organo modified graphene oxide gosulf 165 the resultant product was tested for the removal of mo from wastewater by degradation in solution and adsorption on the membrane surface for the effective separation based on catalytic membrane separation all the membranes were subjected for 3 hours photo catalytic degradation of mo with an initial concentration of 2 10 5 m it was found that nafion gosulf is the most efficient membrane for the treatment and had highest mo removal of 71 and rate constant and 0 0077 min 1 as compared to other membranes accordingly it was suggested that tio2 go and gosulf can be incorporated in nafion for effective degradation of dye molecules go was also impregnated with psf for the preparation of mixed matrix membrane using the non solvent induced phase inversion method and tested for separation of heavy metals from wastewater 166 it was claimed that the proposed membrane could remove up to 96 of metal ions such as pb cu cd and cr with a permeate flux of 30 lmh for initial metal ion concentration of 50 mg l in the feed the spent membranes were regenerated by di water wash and passing hcl solution of ph 5 5 for 30 min at a constant flowrate of 30 l h after removing all the contaminants the hcl regenerated membrane was thoroughly rinsed with water in order to attain neutral ph the results revealed that the regeneration of the membrane has been effective by in situ chemical treatment process with a flux recovery ratio frr of 0 92 166 the fouling issues of cnms based membranes can be resolved by incorporating several active materials like the catalyst biocide etc into the cnms surface layers this active material can be triggered for the removal of fouling materials on the membrane surface fig 11 shows the basic concept of go based nanoparticles composite membranes with cross linking agents on an ultrafiltration membrane support this type of concept was reported recently 167 where go was embedded with titanium nanowires tnw modified by triethanolamine teoa it was found that the modified membrane enhances the water flux because of improved nano channeling and is more stable in the aqueous solution for long time operations the fouling resistance for the membrane was demonstrated by congo red decomposition using uv light irradiation ontio2 nanowires recently guo et al 168 modified pvdf based hollow fiber membranes hfms with cnts and tested for the treatment of real sewage effluent the performance of the modified membrane was also enhanced by preozonation the results revealed that ozone dosage and cnts modified hollow fiber membrane produces high quality permeate by effectively controlling the biofouling because of the deposition of cnts layers inside the hfms the developed membranes were also regenerated by backwashing the treated effluent and exhibits higher regeneration ability compared to unmodified membranes go flakes were also embedded in pes mm membrane for the treatment of spent wash from distilleries 169 in order to increase the hydrophilicity paa and licl were used separately as additives with go pes mm membrane it was reported that the contact angle for the modified membrane was decreased from 70 8 to 58 4 with a maximum of 54 color removal from distillery spent wash safarpour et al 170 blended rgo tio2 with pes for the preparation of nano filtration membranes to enhance the antifouling and separation performance it was reported that the blended membrane showed superior water permeability and fouling resistance in comparison with pure pes membrane without rgo tio2 the highest mean pore diameter of 4 74 nm and water flux of 45 0 lmh was achieved by blending 0 15 wt of rgo tio2 with pes the water flux observed was almost twice as that of pure pes membranes without rgo tio2 the antifouling characteristic of the membrane was measured by using a bsa solution it was found that 0 1 wt rgo tio2 membrane has the best antifouling resistance furthermore the rejection properties of synthesized membranes were also tested for this purpose three different organic dyes with an initial concentration of 100 mg l were used the report reveals that rgo tio2 pes has the maximum rejection efficiency of 99 4 for rg 19 and has higher permeability and effective antifouling characteristics as compared to tio2 pes and go pes membranes in another study 171 a composite of go with tio2 got was synthesized as an ultrafiltration membrane and was compared with pure tio2 membrane without go these membranes were used for the removal of organic pollutants by the photocatalytic mechanism under brackish water saline condition it was reported that got membrane showed higher porosity maximum flux and enhanced antifouling properties as compared to tio2 and decompose diphenhydramine dp and methyl orange mo in the presence of near uv vis and visible light irradiation interestingly the presence of chloride anions which can act as the hole and hydroxyl radical scavengers did not adversely affect the photocatalytic performance but had a detrimental effect on the efficiency of the membrane the synthesized membrane has been easily regenerated by water and ethanol wash displaying the same water flux and rejection rate go based psf hybrid porous membrane adsorber psf go was developed for the removal of seven selected organic contaminants of emerging concern eocs 172 almost 90 of these hazardous materials could be removed after 4 h of operation psf membranes coated with go by imprinting were also produced by kibechu et al 173 to enhance water flux hydrophilicity removal of salts and hydrocarbons from water the coated membranes exhibit higher flux 15 3 lmh and more than 65 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah removal and na2so4 rejection rate of 76 as compared to pure psf membranes which had 8 56 lmh flux and 57 2 rejection respectively to overcome the fouling issues of go membranes a hybrid go tio2 membrane having water filtration and pollutants degradation properties were prepared by single step sol gel process 174 the performance of the membrane has been tested for the degradation of mb by photo catalytically using uv light it was claimed that up to 92 of mb was degraded in 110 min of irradiation this hybrid membrane effectively controls membrane fouling and 96 of flux recovery was reported a hierarchal structured go membrane with thin film catalytic coating of tio2 was developed for water filtration and photocatalytic degradation 175 it was described that permeate flux has an inverse relation with catalyst loading because of the formation of additional cake resistance by catalyst coating on the other hand more catalyst loading enhances dye removal so for maximum flux complete photo degradation and higher dye adsorption catalyst loading and concentration has been optimized the congo red dye 400 mg of tio2 nanosheets tns and graphene oxide go in 100 ml were loaded in dead end filtration cell and at optimum conditions complete removal of dye with a water flux of 29 3 lmh was observed the go based membrane has also been studied for the heavy metals recovery and removal from wastewater 176 go was deposited as an organized layer on hollow fiber support torlon using a layer by layer approach lbl the developed material had an excellent nanofiltration enactment and exhibited super stability during a 150 h filtration test it can remove more than 95 of pb2 ni2 and zn2 with a water flux of 4 7 lmhbar 1 pes membrane embedding with pani go was developed as a composite membrane for metal ions removal 0 25 pani go nanoparticles were reported to be the optimum quantity deposited on pes resulting in 100 pb2 separation the durability and reusability of the developed membrane were measured by immersing the spent membrane in 10 mm edta for 1 h followed by di water wash the regenerated membrane was again processed for lead removal revealing 5 decrease in removal efficiency from 1st cycle to 5th cycle 177 the dye removal has also been studied using go blended pvdf nano hybrid membrane pvdf was solution blended with go tio2 to produced ultrafiltration membranes via phase inversion method and found that water flux was improved almost two times about 500 lmh by using this membrane as compared to pristine pvdf 178 the go tio2 catalytic membrane showed better recovery from fouling zhu et al 179 synthesized pvdf based hybrid membranes of go by the phase inversion process various membranes were prepared by changing go content from 0 wt to 0 9 wt it was reported that 0 5 wt of go based pvdf go nano hybrid achieved maximum water flux of 61 90 lmh at 100 kpa the dye molecule rh b was used to measure the performance of this membrane in terms of membrane adsorption it was reported that even after 20 cycles dye adsorption rates and recovery ratios of nanohybrid membranes was78 2 and 67 8 respectively a composite photocatalytic integrated membrane process was reported using graphitic carbon nitride nanosheet reduced graphene oxide cellulose acetate g c3n4 ns rgo ca 180 the performance of the membrane was tested using rh b and it was found that permeate flux and rh b removal was 3 7 times and 4 times more than that of pure ca membrane with significant improvement in fouling resistance under visible light irradiation go was also be incorporated in the pvdf membrane using trivalent ions such as al3 and fe3 as crosslinkers for the removal of natural organic matter nom as reported by liu 181 it was noticed that trivalent ions enhanced the membrane strength the water flux is 1 1 2 3 times more for fe3 crosslinked membrane as compared to al3 however both the membranes showed the same level of removal efficiency besides trivalent ions go was also cross linked with isophorone diisocyanate ipdi to synthesize covalently modified graphene oxide nanosheets 182 the prepared membrane exhibited enhanced water flux of 80 100 lmh at a low operating pressure of 1 0 bar with the rejection rate of 96 and 70 for dyes and heavy metals respectively recently a study on 3d nanoporous crystals embedded rgo membrane with 2d channels was fabricated 183 it was reported that this unique membrane has almost 15 times more water flux with the same contaminants retention as compared to go membranes because of more inter layer spacing and nanofluidic channels a novel mussel inspired dopamine method was proposed for the production of reduced graphene oxide graphitic carbon nitride rgo g c3n4 nanocomposite membranes for wastewater treatment and oil water emulsion separation 184 it was claimed that the membrane performance extensively depends on g c3n4 ratio and oil water separation efficiency and retention of mb was more than 99 this novel membrane can be reused effectively without considerable change in performance after five cycles of regeneration if appropriately utilized both cnt and go rgo based nanocomposite membranes exhibit superior membrane performance compared to the pure polymeric membrane the superior property is due to the presence of cnms which incorporate and improve the porosity wettability and anchoring the catalyst etc of the membrane unlike cnms based adsorption or catalytic processes the membrane separation process does not have the issue of nanomaterial leaching if phase inversion process used for the membrane preparation the nanomaterials physically trapped in the solidified polymer matrix hence operationally membrane process can be less problematic compared to other methods namely adsorption and catalytic degradation of pollutant removal therefore cnms based membranes may provide a solution for emerging pollutant removal 6 challenges and outlooks of cnms in wastewater treatment the water treatment using cnms already moved from conceptual demonstration to model compound study adsorption and catalytic degradation processes were mostly demonstrated by using dye molecules as the model compound for the adsorption and catalytic degradation as the logical progression it needs to go towards real sample study and upscaling the process however there are still some challenges that need to be addressed to utilize the full benefits of these fascinating new materials the separation of cnms after usage is still challenging in adsorption and catalytic process the use of cnms as such is practically challenging due to its nano size which disperses easily in air and water thus there is always the possibility of leaching to the environment if leaching happens then the consequence of cnms in the treated water creates the new added problem the hybridization solves the leaching considerably at the cost of reduced performance due to the loss of active area site of cnms the second issue that needs to be addressed is the number of reuse of cnms in adsorption and catalytic process most of the literature reports either deal with up to 5 cycles or no recycling at all the number of reuse study should be increased considerably with real samples however cnms fit extremely well in the membrane technology and if the well known processes like phase inversion of organic polymers used then the issues mentioned above are not arising due to the complete arrest of cnms in the polymer matrix the complete utilization of inherent properties of cnms is extremely challenging in the area of membrane technology this is akin to aquaporin system where it was emphatically proven that aquaporin proteins could pass the water molecule at the unprecedented rate however utilizing this unparalleled behavior into a useful product is still a challenging one like aquaporin the individual cnt tubes possess extremely high water flux with an almost frictionless flow of water molecule in the interior of the tube while rejecting the ions however assembling the cnts without compromising its inherent properties into a usable end product as the membrane has a considerable challenge the vertically aligned cnts can be prepared straightforward but transferring those cnts into usable membrane format in large scale without defects has not been succeeded in more than a decade currently go rgo has been studied extensively for the membrane separation by stacking the graphene layer in small scale it needs to be seen whether this process can be upscaled for the real application therefore the need of the hour is the use of cnms in the existing process like phase inversion in membrane preparation pelletization of cnms for adsorption and catalysis might be a more practical approach for immediate benefit in the hybridization process cnms may lose some of its intrinsic advantageous properties nevertheless it provides a real solution for the effective treatment of water wastewater compared to cnts go rgo has some advantages like easy preparation in the lab complete dispersibility in water further chemical modification of go thereby changing its wettability from hydrophilic to hydrophobic etc however the large scale synthesis of go is done by using hazardous wet chemical oxidation in contrast the largescale synthesis of cnts is straightforward nowadays therefore facile synthesis of go at benign conditions needs to be developed finally cnms application demonstrations still dominated by model compound studies in fact last three years literature reports predominately dealt with model compound studies and real wastewater treatment using cnms is hardly reported therefore the real water samples need to be studied for the successful demonstration which can be further utilized by industries the use of real water sample is paramount because most of the real water sample is much complicated than model compound studies done in the laboratories 7 conclusion this review highlights the applications of cnms nanomaterials particularly cnts and go rgo in water and wastewater treatment cnts go rgo and variety of their composites have been employed for the removal of heavy metals and dyes from aqueous solution the three main modes of separation mechanism namely adsorption catalysis and membrane separation are thoroughly discussed for the decontamination of water using cnms in addition to this the main process parameters for adsorption and catalysis such as nature of the adsorbent catalyst dosage nature and concentration of pollutants ph temperature time and separation efficiency were also discussed for the application of membrane technology the membrane material the membrane preparation method nature of pollutant water flux and rejection efficiency are discussed in detail this comprehensive review of literature shows that functionalized cnms and their composites showed maximum adsorption higher catalytic degradation of toxic pollutants and increased flux and rejection rate in the membrane separation these modified materials also have reasonable regeneration ability and can be effectively reused without any significant decline in performance for the successful industrial application more studies involving real water samples for a longer period of operating time using cnms materials will be the next logical progression submission declaration the

14143,several metal organic frameworks mofs were evaluated as a fenton like catalyst for water treatment in a screening process herein we report hydrothermally prepared nh2 mil 101 fe can offer a dual function of good adsorption and excellent fenton like catalytic performances for organic pollutant removal to understand the mode of action of both nh2 and fe mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al were comparatively investigated it was found that the adsorption followed langmuir isotherm and correlated well with pseudo second order kinetic model pseudo first order model was used to describe the catalysis performance a complete decoloration of a relatively high concentration of rhb 0 25 mmol l by was achieved within only 4 10 min at a wide range of ph and attained a high degradation rate constant k of 0 66 min 1 and 1 09 min 1at ph 7 2 and ph 11 respectively these results were comparatively high and tackling the problem of strict ph value 3 1 of fenton reaction and even of most of the fenton like catalysts which are active only in acidic or near natural ph moreover that outstanding performance was maintained after five successive reuse cycles more importantly the material potential use in the real application was validated by rhb mineralization 97 7 toc removal in 20 min and by treating real textile wastewater 83 toc removal in 30 min that excellent performance is a result of the synergetic effect between the high adsorption fast electron transfer and sustainable fe ions release the possible degradation mechanism was proposed keywords metal organic frameworks mofs adsorption fenton like catalyst organic dyes real wastewater degradation 1 introduction water pollution is paramount global environmental problems fenton reaction consists of fe2 h2o2 is widely used in wastewater treatment plants as a powerful producer of hydroxyl radicals oh e0 2 80 v nhe which can cause nonselective oxidation of organic pollutants however it s limited operating ph ph 2 8 3 5 production of iron containing sludge and loss of catalyst are crucial drawbacks heterogeneous fenton reaction or fenton like technology consist of solid catalyst and h2o2 is an attractive alternative for wastewaters gases and soils remediation that can overcome the above mentioned shortcomings 1 although there are some metals have higher redox couple e g e0 al3 al0 1 66 v e0 co3 co2 1 92 v than fe2 e0 fe3 fe2 0 776 v iron possesses key advantages over them including being highly abundant lower in cost reduced toxicity and highly reactive hence fe based fenton like catalysts impregnated or supported in natural or synthetic matrixes have gained great attention 2 however most of the iron impregnated catalysts mainly holding fe3 need uv irradiation to increase the frequency of the fe2 reductive generation another drawback for most reported fenton like catalysts is that they are active only in acidic or near neutral ph 1 3 therefore finding catalysts with high activity and stability at a wide range of ph which can have potential practical application in wastewater treatment still a challenge 1 iron can be coordinated with organic linkers forming fe based metal organic frameworks mofs generally mofs are known for their high surface areas which highlighted them with superior adsorption capacity and thus have attracted considerable interest in many application including fenton like reaction 1 4 however the weak performances of pure mof in activating h2o2 require uv or visible light assistance 5 7 to improve mof s performance lv et al increased the fe concentration in mil 100 fe to increase the active sites 4 they compared the efficiency of mil 100 fe fe3o4 and feii mil 100 fe in mb removal by the combination of adsorption and fenton reaction at a wide ph range of 3 0 8 0 feii mil 100 fe displayed the best catalytic performance in the fenton reaction due to the synergistic effect between fe ii and fe iii and 91 of the mb dye was completely mineralized after about 25 h while the mil 100 fe was superior in the adsorption and total degradation process due to the higher surface area the surface h2o2 activation and efficient electron transfer from active metal to absorbed h2o2 are the key factors that determine the performance of heterogeneous fenton catalyst 8 amination of mil 100 fe can be achieved by merely using aminated linkers which were found to be able to absorb the light at broader wavelength range and can enhance the electron transfer wang et al found that aminated fe containing mofs nh2 mil 101 fe nh2 mil 53 fe and nh2 mil 88b fe exhibited enhanced co2 photo reduction performance comparing with the non functionalized because of the dual excitation pathways of nh2 functionality followed by an electron transfer to the fe centres as well as the direct excitation of fe o clusters fe3 to fe2 9 most recently he et al reported the microwave synthesized nh2 mil 88b fe as an active and recyclable fenton like catalyst at a wide working ph range ph 3 0 11 0 for mb removal 10 however it took 45 min to completely remove the dye under the optimal conditions on the other hand lots of attempts to improve the catalytic performance of mofs by depositing or doping with other metals 1 11 12 which may require multiple preparation steps making their reproduction difficult and the possibility for the dopant detachment that can lower their stability another important fact is that most reported fenton like mofs except very few cases have used synthetic wastewater which momentously differs from the real wastewater 1 therefore finding an efficient mof fenton like catalyst without modification that is simply prepared with high stability and reusability is highly desirable herein we report the use of hydrothermally prepared nh2 mil 101 fe for the first time as a powerful fenton like catalyst nh2 mil 101 fe adsorption and degradation performances were studied in terms of the main variables reaction kinetics catalyst stability degradation mechanism as well as the role of nh2 and fe by comparing the performance with mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al furthermore its application for treating real textile wastewater was examined the strong adsorption and h2o2 activation on the catalyst surface and the fast electron transfer from the fe3o cluster to the substrate as well as the role of leached fe ions in activating the rest of h2o2 in the solution were the main reasons for the superior catalytic performance over other tested mofs 2 materials and methods fecl3 6h2o 2 aminoterephthalic acid h2ata 5 5 dimethyl l pyrroline n

rhodamin b rhb and h2o2 30 w w and other reagents were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd all chemicals were of analytical grade purity and used directly without further depuration 2 1 preparation of mofs the main aim of the present work is to investigate the nh2 mil 101 fe as a fenton like catalyst however to understand the role of nh2 and fe mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al were synthesized and used for comparative studies nh2 mil 101 fe can be synthesized in grams by the simple hydrothermal method 13 firstly 0 675 g 2 497 mmol of fecl3 6h2o was dissolved in 7 5 ml of dmf to obtain solution a secondly 0 225 g 1 242 mmol of 2 aminoterephthalic acid was dissolved in 7 5 ml of dmf to obtain solution b then solutions a and b were mixed together under vigorous stirring for 1 h in room temperature after complete dissolving of the solution mixture it was sealed in a stainless teflon lined autoclave for 24 h at 110 c the resultant product was collected and filtered with dmf and methanol for several times and dried in an oven at 60 c for 12 h to obtain nh2 mil 101 fe mil 101 fe was synthesized using the same procedure used for nh2 mil 101 fe using terephthalic acid as a ligand instead of 2 aminoterephthalic acid nh2 mil 101 al was prepared following a reported method 14 first 0 51 g of alcl3 6h2o and 0 56 g of 2 aminoterephthalic acid were added in 30 ml of dmf and stirred for 30 min after complete dissolution of the above reaction mixture it was sealed in a teflon lined autoclave at 130 c for 72 h next the autoclave was allowed to naturally cool to room temperature finally the resulting yellow powder was filtered and washed with dmf several times activated with methanol and dried at 200 c for 12 h 2 2 adsorption performance test rhb was chosen as an organic pollutant model because it s water soluble chemically stable carcinogenic non biodegradable and it s discharged with large amounts in industrial wastewater a stock solution of rhb dye 0 01 mol l was prepared and diluted to the required initial concentrations 0 1 0 5 mmol l the batch experiments were carried out in 100 ml beaker containing 50 ml of rhb dye solution the effects of the contact time initial dye concentration ph and sorbent doses on the adsorption capacity of nh2 mil 101 fe were investigated at room temperature 25 c 1 the ph was adjusted with naoh 0 1 m or h2so4 0 1 m at a predesigned timing samples were withdrawn and filtered through 0 45 μl membrane filters to remove mof s particles then the absorbance spectra of rhb were collected at 400 650 nm using uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan and the rhb concentrations were calculated based on a standard curve previously prepared at maximum adsorption of 553 nm rhb adsorbed at equilibrium was calculated using the following eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e m v where c0 and ce are initial and equilibrium concentrations of rhb respectively m is the mass of adsorbent and v is the solution volume the adsorption data were described using the langmuir model following this mathematical form of eq 2 2 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e where qm and kl are langmuir constants related to maximum adsorption capacity and energy of adsorption respectively by plotting ce qe against ce a straight line can be obtained the values of qm and b could be calculated from slopes and intercepts in terms of kinetic modelling pseudo ﬁrst order and pseudo second order equations were used to fit the experimental data and expressed as eq 3 and eq 4 respectively 3 l o g e q e q t l o g e q e k 1 t where qt and qe are the amounts of rhb

line can be obtained and the values of qe and k2 can be calculated from slopes and intercepts 2 3 fenton like activity test rhb 0 25 mmol l was selected as a target pollutant to evaluate the catalytic activity of nh2 mil 101 fe the degradation experiments were carried out in a batch mode using three necked flasks 100 ml at room temperature 25 c 1 the ph was adjusted with naoh 0 1 m or h2so4 0 1 m mimicking the practical application and combining the advantage of the adsorption and catalytic effectiveness nh2 mil 101 fe 0 05 g was dispersed in rhb solution 0 25 mmol l 50 ml without ph adjustment ph 7 22 and the degradation reaction was initiated by adding h2o2 0 5 ml under magnetic stirring at predefined time intervals samples were withdrawn and filtered through 0 45 μl membrane filters to remove suspended mofs meanwhile 10 mmol tert butyl was immediately added to quench the reaction and then the absorbance spectra were collected at 400 650 nm using uv vis spectrophotometer and the rhb concentrations were calculated according to the standard curve previously prepared at maximum adsorption of 553 nm to test the catalyst stability and recyclability nh2 mil 101 fe were collected and reused directly for several circles following the previous process for comparison studies the catalytic performances of non aminated fe containing mof mil 101 fe and aminated al containing mof nh2 mil 101 al were also evaluated using the same procedure the control experiments included using h2o2 as an oxidation agent in the absence of nh2 mil 101 fe the data were fitted with the pseudo first order kinetic model which is described by eq 5 5 ln c0 ct kt where c0 and ct mole stands for the concentration at initial and time t and k min 1 is the rate constant of this reaction by plotting time against ln c0 ct against time slopes of the obtained straight line represent k values 2 4 regeneration experiment to assess the reusability of the nh2 mil 101 fe the degradation experiment were carried out using 0 05 g catalyst with 0 25 mmol l rhb 50 ml 0 05 ml without ph adjustment ph 7 22 after 5 min the solution was filtered and mof particles were collected and used directly with fresh rhb solution and h2o2 this process was repeated for five times 2 5 organic pollutants mentoring rhb 50 ml 0 25 mmol l 0 05 g catalyst 0 5 ml h2o2 mineralization and real wastewater

cashmere wuxi co ltd is located at meicun hi tech industrial development zone wuxi city jiangsu province china the wastewater was stored in a dark place at a temperature of 4 c to prevent degradation as presented in table 1s supporting information the wastewater contains a high amount of organic matter with a low bod cod ratio of 0 16 which illustrating being non biodegradable toc removal was

paramagnetic resonance spectrometer emxnano bruker germany 3 results and discussion the xrd patterns and ft ir spectra of the synthesized mofs display that their pure phases have been obtained figs s1 and s2 16 17 fig 1 a shows the adsorption of rhb 50 ml 0 25 mmol l 0 05 g sorbent from aqueous solutions using nh2 mil 101 fe at different ph as the function of the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe against the equilibrium concentration ce it indicates that the equilibrium was reached only after 20 min with color removal of 96 and 97 1 after 60 min moreover there was no significant effect as a result of changing the ph of the dye solution from 3 1 11 which indicated that the adsorption is ph independent it s reported that ph has no influence on mof s adsorption of rhb and the later has larger molecule size than the size of mof s pores illustrating the adsorption mainly depends on the electrostatic nature π π interactions and not on the porosity 18 19 the absorption spectra of rhb under different ph are presented in fig s3 fig 1b shows the result of changing the initial concentration of the rhb it reveals that the saturation point increased significantly with increasing the concentration which can be attributed to the contact of rhb molecules with available surface adsorption sites a similar positive relation was recorded with increasing the dose of nh2 mil 101 fe fig 1c which implies that more the particles dispersed in the solution the more the surface exposed to interact with the dye in the solution these results also suggest that there was no significant nanoparticles aggregation took place in both cases the absorption spectra of rhb with different concentration are presented in fig s4 fig 1d shows the comparison of rhb adsorption by using different types of mof and their corresponding absorption spectra are shown in fig 2 b d interestingly the removal efficiency of rhb using nh2 mil 101 fe was remarkably higher and it was the order of nh2 mil 101 fe mil 101 fe nh2 mil 101 al with maximum removal percentages of about 97 1 after 60 min 88 after 60 min and 60 after 10 min respectively that demonstrates the vital role of both the amine groups nh2 and the fe in the adsorption process it s also necessary to mention that the bet surface areas of nh2 mil 101 fe mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al were found to be 2572 3 m2 g 2122 6 m2 g and 2073 8 m2 g respectively which are consistent with previous reports 16 17 although the porosity has no direct effect on adsorption because of the large molecule size of rhb higher surface area could provide more interacting sites to absorb the dye molecules langmuir sorption isotherm model is commonly used for the sorption of a solute from a liquid solution as it assumes that the sorption takes place at speciﬁc homogeneous sites within the sorbent and once a dye occupies a site no further sorption can take place at that site the data were analyzed using the linear form of the langmuir equation and presented in fig 3 a d and the correlation coefficients r2 were calculated from the slopes and intercepts and listed in table 1 generally the data were fairly fitting langmuir isotherm with r2 values 0 99 except with mil 101 fe it was 0 982 in the case of different ph the adsorption capacity qm values were slightly higher at near neutral ph and in alkaline condition with increasing the concentration of rhb from 0 1 mmol l to 0 5 mmol l the adsorption capacity was increased to reach 0 41 mmol g at a concentration of 0 5 mmol l on the other hand increasing the dose of nh2 mil 101 fe from 0 025 g to 0 75 g has decreased the qm values 0 39 to 0 15 mmol g finally when different mof types were compared with nh2 mil 101 fe the later has shown the highest qm of 0 21 mmol g and remarkably higher kl value followed by mil 101 fe and then by nh2 mil 101 al moreover the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to fit the experimental data the kinetic model fitted the pseudo second order kinetic model the best with correlation coefficient r2 0 99 data plotting are shown in fig 3 e h and the values of qe k2 and r2 are listed in table 1 the values of the theoretical qe were almost similar to those obtained experimentally which suggest that the adsorption process is chemically controlled the catalytic efficiency of nh2 mil 101 fe was investigated in fenton like reaction fig 4 a shows the efficiency of nh2 mil 101 fe at different ph 0 05 g catalyst 0 5 ml h2o2 0 25 mmol l rhb interestingly 70 of the dye was decolored in the first 30 s at a wide ph range from 3 1 11 and complete color removal in less than 10 min interestingly the degradation performance was better at a higher ph where more than 99 of the color removal was achieved after 10 min at ph 3 1 whereas at ph 11 it took only 4 min that indicates nh2 mil 101 fe favors neutral and alkaline condition which is not in agreement with most of the fenton like catalysts the possible reasons for this phenomenon are discussed later with the discussion of the isotherm results these outstanding results increase the potentiality of using nh2 mil 101 fe in practical application because of the short reaction time and the excellent overall catalytic performance at a broad range of ph fig 4b displays the effect of using different doses of h2o2 0 125 0 5 ml and their corresponding absorption spectra are shown in fig s7 interestingly the overall performance with different doses was moderately high and it was the highest with 0 5 ml h2o2 reaching 78 after 30 s and more than 99 after 5 min the comparison of nh2 mil 101 fe with mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al are presented in fig 4c and their corresponding absorption spectra are shown in fig 5 b c it was found that nh2 mil 101 fe has a superior performance with 99 color removal after 5 min while mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al showed only 61 2 and 76 51 after the same time respectively the maximum removal of both mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al was 76 7 and 72 3 after 10 and 8 min respectively that further confirms the synergetic effect between the amine groups and fe in enhancing the catalytic performance of nh2 mil 101 fe fig 6 represents the pseudo first order kinetic model used to analyse the catalytic data and table 2 lists the calculated r2 and k constants the fittings of the data obtained from using nh2 mil 101 fe with different h2o2 doses 0 125 0 75 ml have acceptable r2 values 0 96 and the rate constant k values have increased with increasing the dose of h2o2 from 0 34 to 0 66 min 1 these values revealed the ability of nh2 mil 101 fe to activate higher doses of h2o2 and producing more hydroxyl hydroperoxyl superoxide oh ho2 o2 on the other hand when the ph was changed from 3 1 11 the r2 values were still 0 96 and k values have remarkably increased from 0 46 to 1 09 min 1 by increasing the ph demonstrating the preference of the alkaline condition over the acidic it is noteworthy that fenton like catalysts are more active in acidic and near neutral ph 1 3 especially fe h2o2 in fenton fenton like reaction 20 for instance mil 53 fe h2o2 visible light system was highly dependent on the initial solution ph where the rate constant of carbamazepine degradation at ph 3 was 6 times faster than that at ph 7 4 the nh2 mil 101 fe adsorption performances were found to be ph independent meaning that there should be another reason explaining this phenomenon thus the release of fe ions from nh2 mil 101 fe was investigated at different ph after 5 min of the reaction time see fig s8 and it was found that the lowest released fe concentration was at ph 11 0 27 ppm comparing with 1 45 ppm at ph 7 2 therefore the possible explanation for this phenomenon is that at high ph the material maintained its physicochemical properties to the greatest extent such as the porous structure and metal organic coordination where more rooms being available for the reaction to take place moreover more fe3o clusters being maintained in the frameworks which could facilitate the transfer of formed electrons effectively from the metal center to the substrate meanwhile the lowest release of fe ions at ph 11 could be the optimum concentration to activate the h2o2 in the surrounding environment effectively furthermore it was found that o 2 is predominant active species generated during nh2 mil 101 fe h2o2 reaction these findings agree with a recent report by su et al reported that the catalytic activity of the cu cuo nws mesh significantly increased with the rising of ph value and the rate constant at ph 11 3 was more than twice that at the ph 2 1 21 they found the enhanced activity at higher ph was associated with the lower release of cobber ions and the higher formation of o 2 finally the results of using different types of mof fig 6c and table 2 show that the highest r2 0 96 and the highest k 0 66 min 1 was achieved by nh2 mil 101 fe while it shows the lowest r2 values of 0 92 for mil 101 fe and only 0 88 for nh2 mil 101 al with as low k values as 0 08 and 0 05 min 1 respectively that means the reaction rate constant of nh2 mil 101 fe was 8 3 and 13 2 times faster than mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al respectively despite the fact that mil 101 fe has also shown higher adsorption capacity than nh2 mil 101 al that also emphasizes the role of fe in the fenton reaction which is highly active in producing oh o2 than al and that is more obvious when comparing the nh2 mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al as both contain the amine groups but the performance of the first is remarkably higher than the later the dissolved fe and fe2 were monitored during the reaction time 50 ml 0 5 mmol l rhb 0 05 g nh2 mil 101 fe and 0 5 ml h2o2 and the results are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that it started at 0 85 ppm at the first half minute reaching 1 44 ppm after 3 min and maintained to the end of the reaction additionally the measured fe2 in the same reaction began with 0 2 ppm and maintained an average of 0 35 ppm throughout the reaction xu et al reported the release behavior of fe ions from fe3o4 ceo2 composite which was much higher leaching and increased as time increases reaching 12 ppm 22 this implies nh2 mil 101 fe is more sustainable and would stand in the catalytic reaction for a longer time on the other hand the leaching of fe ions from mil 101 fe was checked after 15 min of the reaction and was found to be much higher than that of nh2 mil 101 fe 23 4 ppm this may explain the superior degradation performance of nh2 mil 101 fe which leaches the iron ions much slower and the released dose appeared to be optimum for fenton reaction especially at higher ph with the lowest leaching record and the best degradation performances it s also worth stating that the rate constant of rhb degradation at ph 7 2 is remarkably higher than all reports to date and some of these results are summarized in table 3 catalyst reuse is a crucial characteristic for practical application in wastewater treatment therefore the nh2 mil 101 fe reuse in fenton like reaction was conducted using non adjusted ph of rhb solution 50 ml 0 25 mmol l rhb 0 05 g catalyst 0 5 ml h2o2 fig 8 a shows that the catalyst has maintained its excellent performance with 98 color removal after 4 cycles and decreased slightly to 93 after the fifth cycle that reveals the high stability of the catalyst and the self regeneration ability without any intermediate treatments moreover the sustainable release of fe ions was examined after each cycle and as can be seen from fig 8b the release behavior was generally stable and the released amount fluctuated between 0 75 ppm and 1 4 ppm the stability and sustainability of nh2 mil 101 fe were further confirmed using sem and edx elemental analysis which are shown in fig 9 the sem images of nh2 mil 101 fe nanoparticles after the fifth cycle of catalytic reaction has maintained its structure with slightly smaller sizes compared with the original sample from the spectra of the elemental analysis shown in fig 9c we can notice the change in the fe content before and after the reaction a detailed elemental content is given in table s1 in supporting information moreover the ft ir spectra were collected for original nh2 mil 101 fe and after adsorption and catalytic reactions fig s9 showing that original function groups are shown on the spectra e g nh2 fe o except the band at 1664 53 cm 1 has disappeared after the adsorption and the catalytic reaction which could be because of the interactions with the dye in practical application cod or and toc measurements are used in wastewater treatment industry therefore we have monitored the toc removal of rhb 0 25 mmol l as well as for real textile wastewater from fig 10 it can be seen that about 83 of rhb toc was removed in the first 5 min and more than 97 after 20 min from the above results we can notice that the major mineralization took place at the first few minutes and after 10 min the mineralization rate was very low with time increasing which implies that it was mainly attributed to catalytic oxidation rather than adsorption 26 in the case of real wastewater which is much more complicated than the synthetic wastewater rhb solution and contains a relatively high concentration of cl that normally suppress the oxidation of h2o2 it took 30 min to degrade about 83 of its toc demonstrating that a residual amount of organic compounds remained in solution even after the complete colour removal however this result is considered to be feasible for practical application it s worth noting that using h2o2 without catalyst had no significant effect on the color or toc within the 30 min which confirms the high stability of the organic contaminants 4 reaction mechanism firstly it s important to note the role of the superior adsorption capacity of nh2 mil 101 fe comparing with the other tested mofs mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al which prominently increased the contact between the dye molecules and h2o2 on the active sites of the catalyst as the formed electron in the fe3 o clusters would be effectively transferred from the metal centers to the substrate toma et al and other found that formation of electronic delocalization state in the μ3 o cluster by the μ3 o atoms could facilitate electron transfer from the metal ions to the oxidant and subsequently the formation of the reactive oxygen species 27 28 meanwhile the leached fe ions could activate the rest of h2o2 and decompose the rest of the dye in the solution as a result more than 78 at ph 7 2 of the color was removed in the first 30 s and more than 99 in only 5 min to have a profound understanding of the mechanism the fenton like reaction was run with the addition of isopropyl alcohol and p benzoquinone separately as oh and o 2 scavengers respectively as demonstrated in fig 11 a with the addition of isopropyl the reaction was slower and only 45 of the color was removed after 30 s and 80 after the 5 min while in the case of p benzoquinone 69 7 was removed after 30 s and 99 after the 5 min fig 11c and 11d show the corresponding absorption spectra that means both o 2 and oh were generated during the reaction but o 2 was more dominating fig 10b shows the pseudo first order isotherm in both cases the data was highly fitting the isotherm with r2 values 0 99 and the k values were 0 2 and 0 88 min 1 with isopropyl and p benzoquinone respectively these results were further confirmed by the esr analysis fig 12 identical spectra were obtained with the addition of both scavengers but the beaks with the p benzoquinone have shown higher intensity these findings reveal that the degradation reaction started with the replacement of coordinated water molecules in iron sites with h2o2 and organic dye molecules immediately fe iii in the catalyst is reduced by h2o2 producing ho2 and the generation of o 2 eq 7 meanwhile dissolved iron fe2 and fe3 formed by dissolution of iron oxides in mof nanoparticles would diffuse into the bulk solution and started the activation of h2o2 through the reactions eqs 8 and 9 to generate oh in a slower rate it was also noticed that the competitive reaction took place and negatively affected the oxidation process as the reaction rate constant was 4 4 times higher when p benzoquinone was added comparing with isopropyl alcohol eq 10 22 finally the organic dye was broken down to co2 and h2o the proposed mechanism is presented in fig 13 7 f e 3 i n c a t a l y s t h 2 o 2 h o 2 h o 2 8 f e 3 d i s s o l v e d h 2 o 2 f e 2 o h o 2 h 9 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 o 2 h 10 o h o 2 h o 2 o 2 h 2 o o h 5 conclusion nh2 mil 101 fe which was simply synthesized by the scalable hydrothermal method has been systematically studied for adsorption and fenton like reactions both nh2 and fe3 o clusters have played a significant role in the adsorption and catalysis reactions which resulted in remarkably higher performances in rhb removal from the aqueous solution comparing with mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al the high degradation rate was maintained in a wide range of ph 3 1 11 and it was even higher at higher ph values moreover nh2 mil 101 fe has exhibited high stability and excellent reusability with the sustainable release of fe ions which further contributed to the degradation of organic molecules more importantly nh2 mil 101 fe was validated for toc removal from the synthetic rhb dye solution as well as for the treatment of real textile wastewater without any ph adjustment and has shown extraordinary performances which suggest its high potentiality to be used in practical application it s also worth noting that by controlling the release of fe ions at a broad range of ph would further enhance the performance

14143,several metal organic frameworks mofs were evaluated as a fenton like catalyst for water treatment in a screening process herein we report hydrothermally prepared nh2 mil 101 fe can offer a dual function of good adsorption and excellent fenton like catalytic performances for organic pollutant removal to understand the mode of action of both nh2 and fe mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al were comparatively investigated it was found that the adsorption followed langmuir isotherm and correlated well with pseudo second order kinetic model pseudo first order model was used to describe the catalysis performance a complete decoloration of a relatively high concentration of rhb 0 25 mmol l by was achieved within only 4 10 min at a wide range of ph and attained a high degradation rate constant k of 0 66 min 1 and 1 09 min 1at ph 7 2 and ph 11 respectively these results were comparatively high and tackling the problem of strict ph value 3 1 of fenton reaction and even of most of the fenton like catalysts which are active only in acidic or near natural ph moreover that outstanding performance was maintained after five successive reuse cycles more importantly the material potential use in the real application was validated by rhb mineralization 97 7 toc removal in 20 min and by treating real textile wastewater 83 toc removal in 30 min that excellent performance is a result of the synergetic effect between the high adsorption fast electron transfer and sustainable fe ions release the possible degradation mechanism was proposed keywords metal organic frameworks mofs adsorption fenton like catalyst organic dyes real wastewater degradation 1 introduction water pollution is paramount global environmental problems fenton reaction consists of fe2 h2o2 is widely used in wastewater treatment plants as a powerful producer of hydroxyl radicals oh e0 2 80 v nhe which can cause nonselective oxidation of organic pollutants however it s limited operating ph ph 2 8 3 5 production of iron containing sludge and loss of catalyst are crucial drawbacks heterogeneous fenton reaction or fenton like technology consist of solid catalyst and h2o2 is an attractive alternative for wastewaters gases and soils remediation that can overcome the above mentioned shortcomings 1 although there are some metals have higher redox couple e g e0 al3 al0 1 66 v e0 co3 co2 1 92 v than fe2 e0 fe3 fe2 0 776 v iron possesses key advantages over them including being highly abundant lower in cost reduced toxicity and highly reactive hence fe based fenton like catalysts impregnated or supported in natural or synthetic matrixes have gained great attention 2 however most of the iron impregnated catalysts mainly holding fe3 need uv irradiation to increase the frequency of the fe2 reductive generation another drawback for most reported fenton like catalysts is that they are active only in acidic or near neutral ph 1 3 therefore finding catalysts with high activity and stability at a wide range of ph which can have potential practical application in wastewater treatment still a challenge 1 iron can be coordinated with organic linkers forming fe based metal organic frameworks mofs generally mofs are known for their high surface areas which highlighted them with superior adsorption capacity and thus have attracted considerable interest in many application including fenton like reaction 1 4 however the weak performances of pure mof in activating h2o2 require uv or visible light assistance 5 7 to improve mof s performance lv et al increased the fe concentration in mil 100 fe to increase the active sites 4 they compared the efficiency of mil 100 fe fe3o4 and feii mil 100 fe in mb removal by the combination of adsorption and fenton reaction at a wide ph range of 3 0 8 0 feii mil 100 fe displayed the best catalytic performance in the fenton reaction due to the synergistic effect between fe ii and fe iii and 91 of the mb dye was completely mineralized after about 25 h while the mil 100 fe was superior in the adsorption and total degradation process due to the higher surface area the surface h2o2 activation and efficient electron transfer from active metal to absorbed h2o2 are the key factors that determine the performance of heterogeneous fenton catalyst 8 amination of mil 100 fe can be achieved by merely using aminated linkers which were found to be able to absorb the light at broader wavelength range and can enhance the electron transfer wang et al found that aminated fe containing mofs nh2 mil 101 fe nh2 mil 53 fe and nh2 mil 88b fe exhibited enhanced co2 photo reduction performance comparing with the non functionalized because of the dual excitation pathways of nh2 functionality followed by an electron transfer to the fe centres as well as the direct excitation of fe o clusters fe3 to fe2 9 most recently he et al reported the microwave synthesized nh2 mil 88b fe as an active and recyclable fenton like catalyst at a wide working ph range ph 3 0 11 0 for mb removal 10 however it took 45 min to completely remove the dye under the optimal conditions on the other hand lots of attempts to improve the catalytic performance of mofs by depositing or doping with other metals 1 11 12 which may require multiple preparation steps making their reproduction difficult and the possibility for the dopant detachment that can lower their stability another important fact is that most reported fenton like mofs except very few cases have used synthetic wastewater which momentously differs from the real wastewater 1 therefore finding an efficient mof fenton like catalyst without modification that is simply prepared with high stability and reusability is highly desirable herein we report the use of hydrothermally prepared nh2 mil 101 fe for the first time as a powerful fenton like catalyst nh2 mil 101 fe adsorption and degradation performances were studied in terms of the main variables reaction kinetics catalyst stability degradation mechanism as well as the role of nh2 and fe by comparing the performance with mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al furthermore its application for treating real textile wastewater was examined the strong adsorption and h2o2 activation on the catalyst surface and the fast electron transfer from the fe3o cluster to the substrate as well as the role of leached fe ions in activating the rest of h2o2 in the solution were the main reasons for the superior catalytic performance over other tested mofs 2 materials and methods fecl3 6h2o 2 aminoterephthalic acid h2ata 5 5 dimethyl l pyrroline n

rhodamin b rhb and h2o2 30 w w and other reagents were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd all chemicals were of analytical grade purity and used directly without further depuration 2 1 preparation of mofs the main aim of the present work is to investigate the nh2 mil 101 fe as a fenton like catalyst however to understand the role of nh2 and fe mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al were synthesized and used for comparative studies nh2 mil 101 fe can be synthesized in grams by the simple hydrothermal method 13 firstly 0 675 g 2 497 mmol of fecl3 6h2o was dissolved in 7 5 ml of dmf to obtain solution a secondly 0 225 g 1 242 mmol of 2 aminoterephthalic acid was dissolved in 7 5 ml of dmf to obtain solution b then solutions a and b were mixed together under vigorous stirring for 1 h in room temperature after complete dissolving of the solution mixture it was sealed in a stainless teflon lined autoclave for 24 h at 110 c the resultant product was collected and filtered with dmf and methanol for several times and dried in an oven at 60 c for 12 h to obtain nh2 mil 101 fe mil 101 fe was synthesized using the same procedure used for nh2 mil 101 fe using terephthalic acid as a ligand instead of 2 aminoterephthalic acid nh2 mil 101 al was prepared following a reported method 14 first 0 51 g of alcl3 6h2o and 0 56 g of 2 aminoterephthalic acid were added in 30 ml of dmf and stirred for 30 min after complete dissolution of the above reaction mixture it was sealed in a teflon lined autoclave at 130 c for 72 h next the autoclave was allowed to naturally cool to room temperature finally the resulting yellow powder was filtered and washed with dmf several times activated with methanol and dried at 200 c for 12 h 2 2 adsorption performance test rhb was chosen as an organic pollutant model because it s water soluble chemically stable carcinogenic non biodegradable and it s discharged with large amounts in industrial wastewater a stock solution of rhb dye 0 01 mol l was prepared and diluted to the required initial concentrations 0 1 0 5 mmol l the batch experiments were carried out in 100 ml beaker containing 50 ml of rhb dye solution the effects of the contact time initial dye concentration ph and sorbent doses on the adsorption capacity of nh2 mil 101 fe were investigated at room temperature 25 c 1 the ph was adjusted with naoh 0 1 m or h2so4 0 1 m at a predesigned timing samples were withdrawn and filtered through 0 45 μl membrane filters to remove mof s particles then the absorbance spectra of rhb were collected at 400 650 nm using uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan and the rhb concentrations were calculated based on a standard curve previously prepared at maximum adsorption of 553 nm rhb adsorbed at equilibrium was calculated using the following eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e m v where c0 and ce are initial and equilibrium concentrations of rhb respectively m is the mass of adsorbent and v is the solution volume the adsorption data were described using the langmuir model following this mathematical form of eq 2 2 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e where qm and kl are langmuir constants related to maximum adsorption capacity and energy of adsorption respectively by plotting ce qe against ce a straight line can be obtained the values of qm and b could be calculated from slopes and intercepts in terms of kinetic modelling pseudo ﬁrst

line can be obtained and the values of qe and k2 can be calculated from slopes and intercepts 2 3 fenton like activity test rhb 0 25 mmol l was selected as a target pollutant to evaluate the catalytic activity of nh2 mil 101 fe the degradation experiments were carried out in a batch mode using three necked flasks 100 ml at room temperature 25 c 1 the ph was adjusted with naoh 0 1 m or h2so4 0 1 m mimicking the practical application and combining the advantage of the adsorption and catalytic effectiveness nh2 mil 101 fe 0 05 g was dispersed in rhb solution 0 25 mmol l 50 ml without ph adjustment ph 7 22 and the degradation reaction was initiated by adding h2o2 0 5 ml under magnetic stirring at predefined time intervals samples were withdrawn and filtered through 0 45 μl membrane filters to remove suspended mofs meanwhile 10 mmol tert butyl was immediately added to quench the reaction and then the absorbance spectra were collected at 400 650 nm using uv vis spectrophotometer and the rhb concentrations were calculated according to the standard curve previously prepared at maximum adsorption of 553 nm to test the catalyst stability and recyclability nh2 mil 101 fe were collected and reused directly for several circles following the previous process for comparison studies the catalytic performances of non aminated fe containing mof mil 101 fe and aminated al containing mof nh2 mil 101 al were also evaluated using the same procedure the control experiments included using h2o2 as an oxidation agent in the absence of nh2 mil 101 fe the data were fitted with the pseudo first order kinetic model which is described by eq 5 5 ln c0 ct kt where c0 and ct mole stands for the concentration at initial and time t and k min 1 is the rate constant of this reaction by plotting time against ln c0 ct against time slopes of the obtained straight line represent k values 2 4 regeneration experiment to assess the reusability of the nh2 mil 101 fe the degradation experiment were carried out using 0 05 g catalyst with 0 25 mmol l rhb 50 ml 0 05 ml without ph adjustment ph 7 22 after 5 min the solution was filtered and mof particles were collected and used directly with fresh rhb solution and h2o2 this process was repeated for five times 2 5 organic pollutants mentoring rhb 50 ml 0 25 mmol l 0 05 g catalyst 0 5 ml h2o2 mineralization and real wastewater treatment 50 ml of wastewater 0 1 g catalyst 0 5 ml h2o2 was monitored by measuring the total organic carbon toc in the samples at different times using shimadzu toc 5000 analyzer 0 1 m kh2po4 0 1 m

cashmere wuxi co ltd is located at meicun hi tech industrial development zone wuxi city jiangsu province china the wastewater was stored in a dark place at a temperature of 4 c to prevent degradation as presented in table 1s supporting information the wastewater contains a high amount of organic matter with a low bod cod ratio of 0 16 which illustrating being non biodegradable toc removal was

teller bet method based on the data collected at 77 k on a micrometrics asap 2020 the concentrations of fe ions were measured after sample acidification with 0 1 m hno3 2 to ensure that all fe ions

paramagnetic resonance spectrometer emxnano bruker germany 3 results and discussion the xrd patterns and ft ir spectra of the synthesized mofs display that their pure phases have been obtained figs s1 and s2 16 17 fig 1 a shows the adsorption of rhb 50 ml 0 25 mmol l 0 05 g sorbent from aqueous solutions using nh2 mil 101 fe at different ph as the function of the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe against the equilibrium concentration ce it indicates that the equilibrium was reached only after 20 min with color removal of 96 and 97 1 after 60 min moreover there was no significant effect as a result of changing the ph of the dye solution from 3 1 11 which indicated that the adsorption is ph independent it s reported that ph has no influence on mof s adsorption of rhb and the later has larger molecule size than the size of mof s pores illustrating the adsorption mainly depends on the electrostatic nature π π interactions and not on the porosity 18 19 the absorption spectra of rhb under different ph are presented in fig s3 fig 1b shows the result of changing the initial concentration of the rhb it reveals that the saturation point increased significantly with increasing the concentration which can be attributed to the contact of rhb molecules with available surface adsorption sites a similar positive relation was recorded with increasing the dose of nh2 mil 101 fe fig 1c which implies that more the particles dispersed in the solution the more the surface exposed to interact with the dye in the solution these results also suggest that there was no significant nanoparticles aggregation took place in both cases the absorption spectra of rhb with different concentration are presented in fig s4 fig 1d shows the comparison of rhb adsorption by using different types of mof and their corresponding absorption spectra are shown in fig 2 b d interestingly the removal efficiency of rhb using nh2 mil 101 fe was remarkably higher and it was the order of nh2 mil 101 fe mil 101 fe nh2 mil 101 al with maximum removal percentages of about 97 1 after 60 min 88 after 60 min and 60 after 10 min respectively that demonstrates the vital role of both the amine groups nh2 and the fe in the adsorption process it s also necessary to mention that the bet surface areas of nh2 mil 101 fe mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al were found to be 2572 3 m2 g 2122 6 m2 g and 2073 8 m2 g respectively which are consistent with previous reports 16 17 although the porosity has no direct effect on adsorption because of the large molecule size of rhb higher surface area could provide more interacting sites to absorb the dye molecules langmuir sorption isotherm model is commonly used for the sorption of a solute from a liquid solution as it assumes that the sorption takes place at speciﬁc homogeneous sites within the sorbent and once a dye occupies a site no further sorption can take place at that site the data were analyzed using the linear form of the langmuir equation and presented in fig 3 a d and the correlation coefficients r2 were calculated from the slopes and intercepts and listed in table 1 generally the data were fairly fitting langmuir isotherm with r2 values 0 99 except with mil 101 fe it was 0 982 in the case of different ph the adsorption capacity qm values were slightly higher at near neutral ph and in alkaline condition with increasing the concentration of rhb from 0 1 mmol l to 0 5 mmol l the adsorption capacity was increased to reach 0 41 mmol g at a concentration of 0 5 mmol l on the other hand increasing the dose of nh2 mil 101 fe from 0 025 g to 0 75 g has decreased the qm values 0 39 to 0 15 mmol g finally when different mof types were compared with nh2 mil 101 fe the later has shown the highest qm of 0 21 mmol g and remarkably higher kl value followed by mil 101 fe and then by nh2 mil 101 al moreover the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to fit the experimental data the kinetic model fitted the pseudo second order kinetic model the best with correlation coefficient r2 0 99 data plotting are shown in fig 3 e h and the values of qe k2 and r2 are listed in table 1 the values of the theoretical qe were almost similar to those obtained experimentally which suggest that the adsorption process is chemically controlled the catalytic efficiency of nh2 mil 101 fe was investigated in fenton like reaction fig 4 a shows the efficiency of nh2 mil 101 fe at different ph 0 05 g catalyst 0 5 ml h2o2 0 25 mmol l rhb interestingly 70 of the dye was decolored in the first 30 s at a wide ph range from 3 1 11 and complete color removal in less than 10 min interestingly the degradation performance was better at a higher ph where more than 99 of the color removal was achieved after 10 min at ph 3 1 whereas at ph 11 it took only 4 min that indicates nh2 mil 101 fe favors neutral and alkaline condition which is not in agreement with most of the fenton like catalysts the possible reasons for this phenomenon are discussed later with the discussion of the isotherm results these outstanding results increase the potentiality of using nh2 mil 101 fe in practical application because of the short reaction time and the excellent overall catalytic performance at a broad range of ph fig 4b displays the effect of using different doses of h2o2 0 125 0 5 ml and their corresponding absorption spectra are shown in fig s7 interestingly the overall performance with different doses was moderately high and it was the highest with 0 5 ml h2o2 reaching 78 after 30 s and more than 99 after 5 min the comparison of nh2 mil 101 fe with mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al are presented in fig 4c and their corresponding absorption spectra are shown in fig 5 b c it was found that nh2 mil 101 fe has a superior performance with 99 color removal after 5 min while mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al showed only 61 2 and 76 51 after the same time respectively the maximum removal of both mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al was 76 7 and 72 3 after 10 and 8 min respectively that further confirms the synergetic effect between the amine groups and fe in enhancing the catalytic performance of nh2 mil 101 fe fig 6 represents the pseudo first order kinetic model used to analyse the catalytic data and table 2 lists the calculated r2 and k constants the fittings of the data obtained from using nh2 mil 101 fe with different h2o2 doses 0 125 0 75 ml have acceptable r2 values 0 96 and the rate constant k values have increased with increasing the dose of h2o2 from 0 34 to 0 66 min 1 these values revealed the ability of nh2 mil 101 fe to activate higher doses of h2o2 and producing more hydroxyl hydroperoxyl superoxide oh ho2 o2 on the other hand when the ph was changed from 3 1 11 the r2 values were still 0 96 and k values have remarkably increased from 0 46 to 1 09 min 1 by increasing the ph demonstrating the preference of the alkaline condition over the acidic it is noteworthy that fenton like catalysts are more active in acidic and near neutral ph 1 3 especially fe h2o2 in fenton fenton like reaction 20 for instance mil 53 fe h2o2 visible light system was highly dependent on the initial solution ph where the rate constant of carbamazepine degradation at ph 3 was 6 times faster than that at ph 7 4 the nh2 mil 101 fe adsorption performances were found to be ph independent meaning that there should be another reason explaining this phenomenon thus the release of fe ions from nh2 mil 101 fe was investigated at different ph after 5 min of the reaction time see fig s8 and it was found that the lowest released fe concentration was at ph 11 0 27 ppm comparing with 1 45 ppm at ph 7 2 therefore the possible explanation for this phenomenon is that at high ph the material maintained its physicochemical properties to the greatest extent such as the porous structure and metal organic coordination where more rooms being available for the reaction to take place moreover more fe3o clusters being maintained in the frameworks which could facilitate the transfer of formed electrons effectively from the metal center to the substrate meanwhile the lowest release of fe ions at ph 11 could be the optimum concentration to activate the h2o2 in the surrounding environment effectively furthermore it was found that o 2 is predominant active species generated during nh2 mil 101 fe h2o2 reaction these findings agree with a recent report by su et al reported that the catalytic activity of the cu cuo nws mesh significantly increased with the rising of ph value and the rate constant at ph 11 3 was more than twice that at the ph 2 1 21 they found the enhanced activity at higher ph was associated with the lower release of cobber ions and the higher formation of o 2 finally the results of using different types of mof fig 6c and table 2 show that the highest r2 0 96 and the highest k 0 66 min 1 was achieved by nh2 mil 101 fe while it shows the lowest r2 values of 0 92 for mil 101 fe and only 0 88 for nh2 mil 101 al with as low k values as 0 08 and 0 05 min 1 respectively that means the reaction rate constant of nh2 mil 101 fe was 8 3 and 13 2 times faster than mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al respectively despite the fact that mil 101 fe has also shown higher adsorption capacity than nh2 mil 101 al that also emphasizes the role of fe in the fenton reaction which is highly active in producing oh o2 than al and that is more obvious when comparing the nh2 mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al as both contain the amine groups but the performance of the first is remarkably higher than the later the dissolved fe and fe2 were monitored during the reaction time 50 ml 0 5 mmol l rhb 0 05 g nh2 mil 101 fe and 0 5 ml h2o2 and the results are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that it started at 0 85 ppm at the first half minute reaching 1 44 ppm after 3 min and maintained to the end of the reaction additionally the measured fe2 in the same reaction began with 0 2 ppm and maintained an average of 0 35 ppm throughout the reaction xu et al reported the release behavior of fe ions from fe3o4 ceo2 composite which was much higher leaching and increased as time increases reaching 12 ppm 22 this implies nh2 mil 101 fe is more sustainable and would stand in the catalytic reaction for a longer time on the other hand the leaching of fe ions from mil 101 fe was checked after 15 min of the reaction and was found to be much higher than that of nh2 mil 101 fe 23 4 ppm this may explain the superior degradation performance of nh2 mil 101 fe which leaches the iron ions much slower and the released dose appeared to be optimum for fenton reaction especially at higher ph with the lowest leaching record and the best degradation performances it s also worth stating that the rate constant of rhb degradation at ph 7 2 is remarkably higher than all reports to date and some of these results are summarized in table 3 catalyst reuse is a crucial characteristic for practical application in wastewater treatment therefore the nh2 mil 101 fe reuse in fenton like reaction was conducted using non adjusted ph of rhb solution 50 ml 0 25 mmol l rhb 0 05 g catalyst 0 5 ml h2o2 fig 8 a shows that the catalyst has maintained its excellent performance with 98 color removal after 4 cycles and decreased slightly to 93 after the fifth cycle that reveals the high stability of the catalyst and the self regeneration ability without any intermediate treatments moreover the sustainable release of fe ions was examined after each cycle and as can be seen from fig 8b the release behavior was generally stable and the released amount fluctuated between 0 75 ppm and 1 4 ppm the stability and sustainability of nh2 mil 101 fe were further confirmed using sem and edx elemental analysis which are shown in fig 9 the sem images of nh2 mil 101 fe nanoparticles after the fifth cycle of catalytic reaction has maintained its structure with slightly smaller sizes compared with the original sample from the spectra of the elemental analysis shown in fig 9c we can notice the change in the fe content before and after the reaction a detailed elemental content is given in table s1 in supporting information moreover the ft ir spectra were collected for original nh2 mil 101 fe and after adsorption and catalytic reactions fig s9 showing that original function groups are shown on the spectra e g nh2 fe o except the band at 1664 53 cm 1 has disappeared after the adsorption and the catalytic reaction which could be because of the interactions with the dye in practical application cod or and toc measurements are used in wastewater treatment industry therefore we have monitored the toc removal of rhb 0 25 mmol l as well as for real textile wastewater from fig 10 it can be seen that about 83 of rhb toc was removed in the first 5 min and more than 97 after 20 min from the above results we can notice that the major mineralization took place at the first few minutes and after 10 min the mineralization rate was very low with time increasing which implies that it was mainly attributed to catalytic oxidation rather than adsorption 26 in the case of real wastewater which is much more complicated than the synthetic wastewater rhb solution and contains a relatively high concentration of cl that normally suppress the oxidation of h2o2 it took 30 min to degrade about 83 of its toc demonstrating that a residual amount of organic compounds remained in solution even after the complete colour removal however this result is considered to be feasible for practical application it s worth noting that using h2o2 without catalyst had no significant effect on the color or toc within the 30 min which confirms the high stability of the organic contaminants 4 reaction mechanism firstly it s important to note the role of the superior adsorption capacity of nh2 mil 101 fe comparing with the other tested mofs mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al which prominently increased the contact between the dye molecules and h2o2 on the active sites of the catalyst as the formed electron in the fe3 o clusters would be effectively transferred from the metal centers to the substrate toma et al and other found that formation of electronic delocalization state in the μ3 o cluster by the μ3 o atoms could facilitate electron transfer from the metal ions to the oxidant and subsequently the formation of the reactive oxygen species 27 28 meanwhile the leached fe ions could activate the rest of h2o2 and decompose the rest of the dye in the solution as a result more than 78 at ph 7 2 of the color was removed in the first 30 s and more than 99 in only 5 min to have a profound understanding of the mechanism the fenton like reaction was run with the addition of isopropyl alcohol and p benzoquinone separately as oh and o 2 scavengers respectively as demonstrated in fig 11 a with the addition of isopropyl the reaction was slower and only 45 of the color was removed after 30 s and 80 after the 5 min while in the case of p benzoquinone 69 7 was removed after 30 s and 99 after the 5 min fig 11c and 11d show the corresponding absorption spectra that means both o 2 and oh were generated during the reaction but o 2 was more dominating fig 10b shows the pseudo first order isotherm in both cases the data was highly fitting the isotherm with r2 values 0 99 and the k values were 0 2 and 0 88 min 1 with isopropyl and p benzoquinone respectively these results were further confirmed by the esr analysis fig 12 identical spectra were obtained with the addition of both scavengers but the beaks with the p benzoquinone have shown higher intensity these findings reveal that the degradation reaction started with the replacement of coordinated water molecules in iron sites with h2o2 and organic dye molecules immediately fe iii in the catalyst is reduced by h2o2 producing ho2 and the generation of o 2 eq 7 meanwhile dissolved iron fe2 and fe3 formed by dissolution of iron oxides in mof nanoparticles would diffuse into the bulk solution and started the activation of h2o2 through the reactions eqs 8 and 9 to generate oh in a slower rate it was also noticed that the competitive reaction took place and negatively affected the oxidation process as the reaction rate constant was 4 4 times higher when p benzoquinone was added comparing with isopropyl alcohol eq 10 22 finally the organic dye was broken down to co2 and h2o the proposed mechanism is presented in fig 13 7 f e 3 i n c a t a l y s t h 2 o 2 h o 2 h o 2 8 f e 3 d i s s o l v e d h 2 o 2 f e 2 o h o 2 h 9 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 o 2 h 10 o h o 2 h o 2 o 2 h 2 o o h 5 conclusion nh2 mil 101 fe which was simply synthesized by the scalable hydrothermal method has been systematically studied for adsorption and fenton like reactions both nh2 and fe3 o clusters have played a significant role in the adsorption and catalysis reactions which resulted in remarkably higher performances in rhb removal from the aqueous solution comparing with mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 al the high degradation rate was maintained in a wide range of ph 3 1 11 and it was even higher at higher ph values moreover nh2 mil 101 fe has exhibited high stability and excellent reusability with the sustainable release of fe ions which further contributed to the degradation of organic molecules more importantly nh2 mil 101 fe was validated for toc removal from the synthetic rhb dye solution as well as for the treatment of real textile wastewater without any ph adjustment and has shown extraordinary performances which suggest its high potentiality to be used in practical application it s also worth noting that by controlling the release of fe ions at a broad range of ph would further enhance the performance

14144,this study investigated the use of a deep eutectic solvent des for promoting the yield and stability of ceria nanoparticles used for the degradation of flumequine flu under uv c irradiation the characterization by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy x ray diffraction spectroscopy raman spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy high resolution transmission electron microscopy thermogravimetric analysis and bet surface area analysis revealed the synthesis of highly stable highly crystalline and mesoporous ceria nanoparticles using des which led to the high removal i e 50 and 94 of flu using des ceria and uv c des ceria respectively removal of flu by the uv c mediated ceria nanoparticles was due to oh and thus factors that influenced the reactivity and yield of oh retarded the removal efficiency of flu the ph of aqueous solution affected the removal of flu by the photocatalysts and removal of flu was inhibited at highly alkaline and acidic ph the degradation pathways of flu were established from the pattern of its degradation and nature of the degradation products acute and chronic toxicities of flu as well as its products were measured the photocatalyst synthesized in des was found to be environmentally benign and showed significant potential in the remediation of flu keywords ceria nanoparticles deep eutectic solvent flumequine water treatment yield photocatalysis 1 introduction pharmaceuticals includes classes of compounds which are extensively applied to control human and veterinary infections 1 3 the major part of these pharmaceuticals are not completely metabolized inside human and animal bodies and consequently excreted as non metabolites or active metabolites via urine and or feces into the aquatic environment 1 4 5 other sources of inclusion of the pharmaceuticals into aquatic environment are disposal of expired pharmaceutical products and effluents from the pharmaceutical industries 4 one most important pharmaceutical is flumequine flu an antimicrobial agent of the fluoroquinolone family most frequently used to treat human and veterinary diseases 1 6 high amount of this drug is thus used in daily life throughout the world 6 flu is reportedly resistant to biodegradation and thus a high concentration of this drug is reported in the aquatic environment 1 7 pharmaceutical contamination in the aquatic environment leads to several issues such as bacterial resistance and hazardous effects on aquatic organisms and human beings 3 8 besides pharmaceuticals yield degradation products dps in the aquatic environment which are also reported to be of environmental concern 3 this looks into developing highly efficient technologies for assessing toxicities of flu as well as its dps and their decontamination from contaminated water the metal oxides based semiconductor photocatalysts are gaining researcher s interest for decontamination of recalcitrant organic pollutants due to their potential practical applications and capability to trounce the pollutants 2 9 10 one important among these is cerium oxide ceo2 ceria a highly non toxic cheap and environmentally friendly photocatalyst which absorb light in the near uv region and also slightly in the visible region besides high band gap energy 10 the major drawback with the synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles is their stability and yield that limit their potential practical applications 11 the stability and yield of the ceria nps are controlled in this study using deep eutectic solvent des previous studies show that nanoparticles nps synthesized in ionic liquid il are mono dispersed and non agglomerated and consequently give highly stable nps with high yield 12 a recently introduced il analogue des that possesses outstanding characteristics such as cheap raw materials simple preparation procedure and biocompatibility is used in this study for the synthesis of ceria 13 the use of des as a solvent in the synthesis of nps is rarely explored the stability and yield of ceria in des as well as the degradation of flu using des ceria under uv c irradiation are explored in detail in this study since the wavelength of maximum absorption for flu falls in the range of uv c i e 200 280 nm the uv c irradiation illumination is expected to cause high removal of flu 6 besides due to high band gap energy the ceria np is expected to be easily activated by uv c and yield conduction band electrons i e ecb and valence band holes e g hvb that subsequently reacts in aqueous solution and produce hydroxyl radical

has high potential in destroying a wide range of recalcitrant water contaminants into less toxic and or harmless products 15 16 the oh reacts with organic compounds at a high rate in the range from

using different ph of an aqueous solution the stability and efficiency of the photocatalyst was investigated in term of leaching of cerium ions and degradation of flu for different treatment cycles reactivity of flu with oh has been investigated through competition kinetic and radical scavenger studies the effects of different initial concentrations of flu natural water parameters such as inorganic anions cl no3 no2 so4 2 co3 2 hco3 and natural organic matter nom have been studied in detail the proposed degradation pathways of flu were established from the nature of dps identified toc

the chemicals employed in this study were analytical reagent grade and used as supplied ultra pure water with resistivity of 18 2 mω cm and obtained from the milli q system millipore was used for preparation of all the experimental solutions used in this study 2 2 synthesis of des des is a mixture of two safe and cheap constituents that are capable to form a homogeneous composition one of the two constituents is a hydrogen bond donor hbd and the other is hydrogen bond acceptor hba and the synthesis can be confirmed by lowering of melting point of des as compared to its individual constituents 18 in this case des was formed by mixing ctab cetyltrimethylammonium bromide with acetic acid in 1 1 ratio by mass at 70 c for 3 h in a round bottom flask fitted under a condenser to form a homogeneous mixture acetic acid was used as hbd and ctab as an hba it was solidified below 70 c which differed from the melting points of the individual constituents 19 20 fig s1 supportive information shows the diagrammatic representation of the synthesis of des and the nature of bonds existing between the constituents 2 3 synthesis of cerium oxide nanoparticles the synthesis of ceria nps was done by mixing 10 ml isopropyl alcohol 10 ml ethylene glycol and 0 3 g ammonium cerium iv nitrate that formed red solution to this solution 1 0 ml of molten des was added drop wise under

irradiation for different times from 0 to 120 min except 360 min in case of toc removal before exposure to irradiation an aqueous solution of flu containing des ceria and ceria was kept for 30 min to establish adsorption desorption equilibrium the solution was then exposed to uv c irradiation emitting from a photochemical reactor enclosed in a box as shown in scheme 1 the source was started each

the fluence rate of the reactor the ph of the reactor solutions was adjusted using 0 05 m naoh and hclo4 after each uv c treatment 150 ml of the reaction sample was taken and mixed with the same volume of oh quenching agent i e methanol prior to analysis with hplc the photochemical treatment of flu was repeated for three times and to represent standard errors of the mean error bars were put

mm h2so4 water as the mobile phase the concentration of cerium ions discharged from des ceria and ceria in a treated aqueous solution of flu was estimated by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas perkinelmer aa800 toc analyzer schimadzu vcsh asi was used for the analysis of total organic carbon toc in treated flu solutions following the method from our previous published work 22 2 7 ecotoxicity estimation the ecological structure activity relationship ecosar an efficient toxicity predictive program based on the use of structure activity relationships sars was used to estimate ecotoxicities as a function of acute and chronic toxicities of flu and its dps 23 the study is useful to test the potential and usefulness of the tested treatment technologies the ecosar was used to

of ecosar the lc50 and ec50 were used to measure the acute toxicities of flu and its dps while chronic toxicities were estimated as a function of chv 23 3 results and discussions 3 1 ftir analysis of des ftir analysis was done to study the chemical and physical combination of the constituents with the help of characteristic peaks of acetic acid for the carboxyl group co and coh that are shown at 1706 and 3000 cm 1 24 whereas characteristic peaks of ctab at 908 1473 2850 and 2915 cm 1 belong to cyanide group and scissoring mode symmetric stretching and asymmetric stretching of ch2 respectively 25 since des is the simple homogeneous mixture of acetic acid and ctab that s why des spectrum contained all ctab and acetic acid prominent peaks change of sharpness broadening and intensity of ftir peaks represent the hydrogen bonding effect 26 in des spectra the lesser intensity of peak was observed at 1706 cm 1 whereas the peak at 3000 cm 1 disappeared as compared to acetic acid spectra strongly indicate the presence of hydrogen bonding fig 1 a shows the ftir spectra for des as well as the constituents of des 3 2 des mediated synthesis of ceria nps in synthesis two types of solvents acetic acid and des ctab acetic acid were used ctab a known cationic surfactant was used in the synthesis of nanoparticles which helps in providing sufficient stabilization to the nanoparticles 27 similarly acetic acid has the stabilizing effect on nanoparticles therefore a combination of ctab and acetic acid in the form of des will enhance the stabilization of ceria nps with a higher yield the literature reported method 28 was used in the case of acetic acid which results in 0 06 g of ceria while for des mediated 0 117 g yield of ceria was obtained from the same molar ratios of the starting materials furthermore the des contained solvent was recycled for the synthesis of the second cycle of ceria which was 0 11 g yield 3 3 characterization of ceria and des ceria ftir spectra of ceria and des ceria that is ranging from 4000 to 600 cm 1 is shown in fig 1b the peaks at 888 cm 1 1024 cm 1 and 1347 cm 1 belong to the bending and stretching vibrations of co coc and ch respectively these groups come from the precursors used in the synthesis of both ceria nps 29 31 the peaks at 1416 cm 1 1649 cm 1 and 1539 cm 1 indicate hoh bending vibration as the moisture is absorbed by the particles 32 the peak at 1067 cm 1 is for the oceo stretching vibrations 31 33 the curve peak at 3305 cm 1 is for oh stretching of the water molecules absorbed 34 the ftir spectra of both ceria and the des ceria are identical and had the same characteristic peaks which confirm that both the prepared materials are the same moreover the spectral patterns of the prepared ceria are the same as reported in the literature 31 34 x ray diffraction spectroscopic analysis was performed to study the crystal structure and grain size of ceria and des ceria using the scan range between 20 70 radiation voltage 30 kv current 20 ma and the scan rate of 0 030 s the xrd profile exhibited four 04 diffraction peaks observed at 28 56 32 81 47 13 and 56 20 with planes corresponding to 112 201 214 and 311 facets of des ceria and pristine ceria fig 1c the xrd diffraction peaks were completely indexed to the cubic structure of ceria nanoparticles with jcpds card no 98 010 5736 moreover both the xrd spectra also did not reflect the presence of any peak of impurity which further verified the formation of single phase crystals 35 the crystal size of the des ceria and pristine ceria was calculated using debye scherrer equation eq 5 5 d k λ β c o s θ where d k λ β and cosθ represents crystal size dimensionless shape factor wavelength of x rays line broadening at half of the maximum gained intensity and bragg angles given in degrees the parameters estimated from xrd analysis for des ceria and ceria are given in table 1 fig 1d depicts the raman spectra of the des ceria and ceria nps showing peak at 455 cm 1 which is attributed to the symmetrical stretching mode of ceo8 vibrational unit 36 this vibrational mode is the typical raman active one for the fluorite crystal structure where oxygen atoms vibrate symmetrically around the cation in literature a raman active mode peak has been observed at 464 cm 1 for bulk ceria 37 the peaks observed at 455 cm 1 in this study results from downshifting the only allowed first order f2g mode of the bulk crystal at 464 cm 1 38 shifting in line position along with noteworthy asymmetry and line broadening is common to both des ceria and ceria the broadness of the peak in the case of des ceria indicates the lowering of the particle size in the presence of des the absence of any peak at around 585 600 cm 1 corroborates for an almost defect free ceria 39 the sem edx analysis was performed to investigate the morphology and elemental composition of ceria and des ceria nanoparticles as shown in fig 1e a b even though the particles are attached to each other by the grain boundary to form the agglomerates but the nanoparticles formed by the hydrothermal method have uniform distribution 40 in both cases the particles are spherical with varying sizes in the ranges of 20 90 nm of average particle size 55 nm the particle size variation was attributed to the formation of agglomerates because of the magnetic effect of the nanoparticles 41 the edx analysis gives the elemental composition of ceria and des ceria both the samples contain ce o and c as shown in fig 1e a b and table 2 both des ceria and ceria have similar elemental composition which confirms the purity of the samples the presence of c might be either from the sem carbon tape or the starting materials used in the synthesis of both ceria nps or due to some remnants from the synthesis fig 1f a b depicts the hrtem images of ceria and des ceria it can be seen that ceria is agglomerated in nature fig 1f a and have low crystallinity compared to des ceria fig 1f b the fringes observed in fig 1f a b provides the crystallographic spacing of the ceria crystallites the fringes that are frequently observed in fig 1f a b corresponds to 111 and 200 crystallographic planes of ceria cerianite phases the high crystallinity of des ceria could be due to the reason that des did not allow ceria particles to encounter each other and thus reduces the chances of ceria particles to agglomerate particle growth hindering fig 1g a and g b depicts the tga and dtg analysis of ceria and des ceria nanoparticles respectively the first weight loss attributed to the removal of adsorbed water vapors on the surface of the ceria and des ceria nps this weight loss was observed below 100 c i e approximately 5 in the tga curve fig 1g a and is also indicated by the dtg curve in fig 1g b the weight loss of 3 5 assigned to organic residual compounds were degraded 42 43 between 100 225 c which was also indicated by the dtg curve centered at 78 c and 207 c for the ceria and at 64 c and 218 c for the des ceria the weight loss related to the decomposition of ceria was increased by increasing the temperature from 225 c to 500 c and approximately 15 weight was lost in both the cases 31 33 in comparison the des ceria nps t max 350 c were more stable as compare to ceria t max 260 c this increase in thermal stability of ceria nps in the presence of des ought to enhance electrochemical stability the n2 adsorption desorption of the as synthesized ceria and des ceria was analyzed using micromeritics as shown in fig 1h and textural properties such as brunauer emmett teller bet surface area barrett joyner halenda bjh pore size and pore volume were determined as shown in table 3 the surface area pore size and pore volume were 130 2 m2 g 3 6 nm and 0 12 cm3 g for the des ceria and 87 3 m2 g 4 07 nm 0 092 cm3 g for the ceria table 3 the results showed that des mediation of ceria led to increased porosity and surface area compared to other method of syntheses where surface area is much lower 44 45 the high surface area and small pore size suggests the mesoporous nature of the synthesized solid adsorbent materials 46 the high surface area and small pore size suggest the high adsorption efficiency of des ceria as compared to ceria 3 4 the photocatalytic performance of des ceria and ceria the photocatalytic performance of des ceria and ceria was investigated towards degradation of flu under five different conditions e g des ceria only ceria only uv c only uv c des ceria and uv c ceria in case of des ceria only and ceria only aqueous solution of flu was treated for 2 h time corresponding to 720 mj cm2 the result shows 50 35 33 94 and 73 removal of flu by des ceria only ceria only uv c only uv c des ceria and uv c ceria respectively fig 2 a the removal by des ceria only and ceria only could be due to accumulation of flu on the surface of the photocatalysts since both des ceria and ceria have high surface areas and consequently high accumulation of the flu molecules are expected on the surface of the photocatalysts the high removal efficiency of flu by des ceria than ceria was possibly due to the much higher surface area of the former i e 130 18 m2 g than the later i e 87 32 m2 g that ensures better accessibility of the target molecule to the active sites the treatment by uv c only also resulted in significant removal of the flu i e 33 which was possibly due to absorption of uv c photons by the target contaminant its consequent excitation and degradation of the excited molecule into dps after passing through several physical and chemical processes as shown in reactions 6 8 6 f l u h v f l u 7 f l u i n t e r m e d i a t e s 8 i n t e r m e d i a t e s d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t s the significant improvement in the removal of flu by uv c des ceria and uv c ceria could be due to the involvement of reactive oxygen species in the presence of uv c the photocatalysts yield primarily ecb and hvb that reacts further in aqueous solution and give oh reactions 1 4 the oh produced readily attack flu and caused its degradation into dps as depicted in reactions 9 and 10 9 f l u o h i n t e r m e d i a t e s 10 i n t e r m e d i a t e s d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t s the scavengers studies using copper ion cu2 formic acid hco2h and tert butyl alcohol t buoh as the quenching agents for ecb hvb and oh respectively were done to investigate ecb and hvb contribution in the yield of oh as well as assess the oh role in degradation of the flu 2 9 the results as shown in fig 2b depicts that the addition of hco2h and t buoh inhibited the degradation of flu by des ceria and ceria while addition of cu2 showed very minimal influence since hvb reacts in water and yield oh thus scavenging of hvb inhibit the rate of oh formation 2 9 similarly t buoh reacts very fast with oh 47 thus presence of t buoh could inhibit reactivity of oh with the target contaminant and consequently retarded the removal of flu in our study on contrary in the presence of cu2 that was used to quench ecb minimal effect on the degradation of flu was observed which also supported the contribution of hvb in the yield of oh this study showed that the rate of formation of oh and also reactivity of oh with flu play vital role in the degradation of flu by uv c des ceria and uv c ceria the second order rate constant of oh with flu k o h f l u was estimated by the method of competition kinetic as discussed in our previous study 16 and k o h f l u was calculated to be 5 7 109 m 1 s 1 the high second order rate constant value also suggests fast reactivity of oh with flu and thus factors that affect this reactivity could inhibit degradation of flu since des ceria showed high surface area and consequently rendered high adsorption of the target contaminant thus high removal of flu was observed in uv c des ceria than uv c ceria 3 5 cyclic performance of des ceria and ceria as well as leaching of ce ions this study is beneficial to suggest potential practical applications and greenness of the as synthesized photocatalyst for removal of emerging water pollutants the removal of flu by uv c des ceria and uv c ceria was investigated for six consecutive cycles and removal efficiency obtained are shown in fig 3 the removal efficiency of flu was dropped from 94 at first cycle to 68 at six cycle in the uv c des ceria while the removal efficiency of flu dropped from 73 at first cycle to 25 at six cycle in the case of uv c ceria the greater decline in removal efficiency of flu in the case of uv c ceria depicts lower stability of the ceria than des ceria this study suggests that the use of des besides enhancing yield and efficiency also enhances the stability of the photocatalysts further the analysis of cerium ions was conducted in aqueous solutions of flu treated with uv c des ceria and uv c ceria to assess stability and greenness of the photocatalyst the concentrations of ce ions discharged from the photocatalysts were analyzed in aqueous solution for each cycle and found to be 0 03 mg l for des ceria and 0 1 mg l for ceria at sixth cycle the lower concentrations of cerium ions discharged into aqueous solution suggest the des ceria to be highly stable as well as environmentally friendly and was thus highly recommended for treatment of emerging water pollutants the high efficiency enhanced stability and greenness attract performance of the des ceria to be further investigated in detail in the following studies 3 6 influence of operational parameters effects of ph ph play vital role in photocatalytic degradation of water pollutants as change in ph influence charge on the surface of the photocatalyst redox potential of reactive oxygen species chemistry of the target contaminant and electrostatic interaction between the charge on the surface of the photocatalyst and that on the target contaminant 9 48 thus the removal of flu by des ceria under uv c was investigated at different ph i e 2 8 6 8 8 7 and 11 3 while keeping initial concentrations of flu and the photocatalyst constant the point of zero charge of des ceria was calculated by drift method and found to be 7 1 which was in close agreement to the previously reported value 49 50 the point of zero charge value suggest the surface of the photocatalyst to be positively charged at acidic ph excessive h and negatively charged at alkaline ph excessive oh as proposed in eqs 11 and 12 11 c e o h h c e o h 2 12 c e o h o h c e o h 2 o the pka value of 6 5 for flu suggest the flu represented here by ha at ph 6 5 to be partially dissociated into anionic a form in a medium of ph 6 5 while cationic h2a form in a medium of ph 6 5 as shown in eqs 13 and 14 respectively 7 13 ha o h a h 2 o p h 6 5 14 ha h h 2 a p h 6 5 in our study maximum removal of flu i e 94 was achieved at ph 6 8 followed by 82 at ph 8 7 while removal of flu was least at ph 11 3 i e 35 and ph 2 8 e g 43 as shown in fig 4 a the values of point of zero charge and pka suggest that both des ceria and flu surfaces bear negative charge at highly alkaline ph while cationic charge at highly acidic ph and consequently undergo electrostatic repulsion reactions at these ph conditions the electrostatic repulsion led to minimum accumulation of flu on the surface of the photocatalyst and consequently inhibited removal of flu at highly acidic and basic ph conditions in our study the scavenging of oh by excessive oh as shown in reaction 15 and decrease in oxidation potential of oh at high alkaline ph are other possible reasons for lower removal of fu at high ph 2 15 o h o h o h 2 o k 61 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 a t a l k a l i n e p h the possible reason for maximum removal of flu at weak alkaline condition i e ph 8 7 is the generation of sufficient oh as shown in reaction 16 2 16 h v b o h o h effects of initial concentrations of flu the photocatalytic degradation of flu by des ceria under uv c irradiation was investigated employing different initial concentrations of flu i e 2 5 5 0 10 and 20 mg l while keeping other conditions such as dose of photocatalyst and ph constant the results show decline in removal efficiency of flu with elevating the level of flu and maximum removal of flu was observed at flu 0 2 5 mg l while minimum at flu 0 20 mg l fig 4b the most possible reasons for the lowering in removal efficiency with increasing flu 0 looked to be 1 the contest between flu molecules for oh that could be maximum at high level of flu 2 the contest between flu and its dps for oh that might be high at high flu 0 3 at high concentration the absorption of uv c irradiation by the target contaminant and the oxidant might inhibit and consequently affect the rate of formation of oh and 4 competition for adsorption sites between the target contaminant molecules that could be high at high concentration of flu and consequently lower the adsorptive removal of the flu at its high concentration 9 16 51 52 effects of dose of des ceria the purpose of this study was to know optimum level of the photocatalyst for maximum removal of flu while keeping other parameters i e flu 0 and ph constant from the experimental results achieved the removal efficiency of flu was found to be 50 67 80 and 94 at des ceria 0 of 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 g l respectively at a reaction time of 120 min under uv c irradiation fig 4c the enhanced removal efficiency of flu at high des ceria 0 could be attributed to the high rate of formation of oh and availability of more active sites for the adsorption of flu molecules at high dose of des ceria 9 52 3 7 effects inorganic anions and nom the potential of des ceria to treat pollutants in water containing different additives aqueous solutions of flu were spiked with natural water parameters such as inorganic anions i e cl no3 no2 so4 2 co3 2 and hco3 and nom and treated with des ceria under uv c irradiation the results show that removal of flu by des ceria under uv c irradiation was decreased in the order of no2 co3 2 nom hco3 cl so4 2 no3 table 4 the possible reasons for the decline in removal efficiency of flu in the presence of the inorganic anions and nom could be attributed to the competition for adsorption sites and oh between inorganic anions and or nom and flu molecules 9 47 the maximum inhibition of flu removal by no2 and co3 2 among the inorganic anions looked to be due to their fast kinetics with oh reactions 17 and 18 47 17 o h n o 2 n o 2 o h k 8 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 18 o h c o 3 2 c o 3 o h k 3 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 due to higher second order rate constants of no2 and co3 2 with oh both these inorganic anions are expected to compete greatly with flu for oh and consequently caused higher inhibition of the degradation of flu in our study and was consistent to the trend observed in previous studies 9 47 besides co3 2 boost ph of the aqueous solution and as discussed earlier in the ph effects study the high ph declined degradation of flu by uv c des ceria the addition of nom also suppressed removal of flu in our study which was possibly due its fast kinetic with oh reaction 19 and consequently greater competition with flu for oh 19 o h n o m p r o d u c t s k 2 23 10 8 m 1 s 1 the removal of flu by des ceria under uv c was suppressed at slightly lower rate than no2 and co3 2 though nom has high kinetic with oh the most possible reason looked to be the formation of reactive species from photolysis of nom and their participation in the removal of flu 53 the possible reasons for the inhibition in removal of flu in the presence of hco3 looked to be due to its scavenging of oh reaction 20 and also boost in ph of aqueous solution 9 47 20 o h h c o 3 h 2 o c o 3 k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 furthermore the addition of cl inhibited the degradation of flu by des ceria under uv c irradiation but at lower rate despite its fast kinetics with oh reaction 21 the reaction between cl and oh results in the formation of secondary reactive species as shown in reactions 21 24 and these might participate in the degradation of flu 2 47 21 c l o h c l o h k 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 22 c l o h c l o h k 6 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 23 c l o h c l o h k 6 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 24 c l h 2 o h o c l h k 2 5 10 5 m 1 s 1 the addition of so4 2 and no3 suppressed the degradation of flu by the des ceria under uv c but at much lower rate than other anions which was possibly due to their low reactivity with oh and formation of highly reactive so4 by reaction of so4 2 with oh reaction 25 2 8 25 s o 4 2 o h s o 4 o h k 3 5 10 5 m 1 s 1 the reactivity of no3 with oh though is not known but is reported to minimally affect the removal of target contaminants by oh 3 9 3 8 mineralization of flu the mineralization of flu in term of toc removal by uv c des ceria and uv c only conditions was investigated that is important for potential practical applications of the tested technologies 53 54 the study for removal of toc of the flu was performed at high uv fluence i e 2160 mj cm2 6 0 h under the conditions of high concentrations of flu and des ceria i e flu 0 40 mg l and des ceria 0 1 0 g l as mineralization is a multistep and complex process 53 55 at a uv fluence of 2160 mj cm2 88 toc removal of the flu was achieved by des ceria under uv c as compared to 27 by uv c only fig 5 the results depict the uv c mediated des ceria to be highly efficient in the remediation of flu also 3 9 analysis of flu by products and developing proposed degradation pathways the proposed degradation pathways of flu by ceria under uv c irradiation were developed from the pattern of the degradation of flu and the dps analyzed by uplc ms ms and are presented in fig 6 the uplc ms ms analysis showed formation of total eleven dps of flu two by uv c while nine due to uv c mediated des ceria and ceria processes fig 6 the dps were identified from the ms search library installed in the uplc ms ms and ms spectra of some of the dps are provided in fig s2 a c in case of uv c only the photoexcited flu molecule undergo initially defluorination and hydroxylation leading to the formation of dp1 which further undergoe series of reactions following decarboxylation and form dp2 as shown in scheme i of the fig 6 the dps formed as a consequence of the oh attack on flu are mainly via substitution and elimination reactions 1 addition to the unsaturated bond electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction reactions as shown in scheme ii and scheme iii fig 6 56 the degradation product dp3 in scheme ii was observed because of the decarboxylation and electron abstraction from n followed by ring opening at n c position and has been reported in previous relevant study too 6 furthermore addition of oh to the unsaturated double bond converted dp3 into dp4 which was then converted into dp5 through defluorination and hydroxylation the attack of oh on the co group of the dp5 led to the formation of dp6 through decarboxylation moreover h abstraction from the carbon of the ring bearing nh group and hydroxylation form dp7a while h abstraction from the carbon bearing oh group followed by dehydrogenation led to the formation of dp7b the dp8 was formed from dp7a through the loss of side chain bearing methyl group scheme iii in fig 6 depicts formation of dp9 through attack of oh on flu involving defluorination reaction 57 and the dp9 subsequently transform into dp10 through decarboxylation reaction 7 the defluorination reaction in the conversion of flu into dps was confirmed from the analysis of f by ic in aqueous solution of flu treated by uv c only and uv c with ceria and des ceria further the aqueous solutions of flu treated with uv c and uv c with ceria nps were analyzed for other anionic products and analyzed formation of acetate in uv c des ceria and uv c ceria the formation of acetate suggests the breakdown of flu and its dps into smaller fragments and also proved mineralization of flu 3 10 toxicities evaluation of flu and its dps the potential of treatment process in degradation of water pollutants depends on the toxicity reduction of the treated solution as the dps can sometime be more toxic than the contaminant itself in this regard the procedure proposed by the european union and chinese hazard evaluation for new chemical species e g compound showing low chronic and acute toxicity value mg l divulge high toxic nature based on the use of ecosar program was followed to check the toxicity level of flu and its dps towards aquatic organisms fish daphnia and green algae 3 23 58 different toxicity levels were shown by flu and its dps towards all the investigated aquatic organisms table 5 the toxicity levels of most of the dps were higher than flu and emergence of such dps necessitate more research to evaluate toxicities of dps along with the parent compound as well as abate their toxicities through adjusting photocatalytic degradation controlling parameters and consequently develop safe green route the formation of acetate as the end product of the treatment suggests the final product of flu degradation to be non toxic 9 4 conclusions in this study it was concluded that the use of des gave high yield of ceria and the des ceria proved highly stable environmentally friendly and efficient in the degradation of flu the detailed characterization showed the synthesized ceria nps in des to be highly mesoporous and crystalline and showed small size with uniform surface the des ceria showed high photocatalytic degradation of flu and this removal was dependent on ph 0 flu 0 and photocatalyst 0 as well as on the presence of co existing anions and nom the dps of flu were detected by uplc ms ms and degradation pathways were proposed from the pattern of degradation of flu and nature of identified dps most of the dps showed high toxicity than parent compound which open new windows for researchers to investigate toxicities of degradation products of pharmaceuticals along with the parent compounds the formation of non toxic acetate product suggests the usefulness of the treatment process in detoxification of target contaminant the photocatalyst synthesized in des showed best performance even after six cycles the

14144,this study investigated the use of a deep eutectic solvent des for promoting the yield and stability of ceria nanoparticles used for the degradation of flumequine flu under uv c irradiation the characterization by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy x ray diffraction spectroscopy raman spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy high resolution transmission electron microscopy thermogravimetric analysis and bet surface area analysis revealed the synthesis of highly stable highly crystalline and mesoporous ceria nanoparticles using des which led to the high removal i e 50 and 94 of flu using des ceria and uv c des ceria respectively removal of flu by the uv c mediated ceria nanoparticles was due to oh and thus factors that influenced the reactivity and yield of oh retarded the removal efficiency of flu the ph of aqueous solution affected the removal of flu by the photocatalysts and removal of flu was inhibited at highly alkaline and acidic ph the degradation pathways of flu were established from the pattern of its degradation and nature of the degradation products acute and chronic toxicities of flu as well as its products were measured the photocatalyst synthesized in des was found to be environmentally benign and showed significant potential in the remediation of flu keywords ceria nanoparticles deep eutectic solvent flumequine water treatment yield photocatalysis 1 introduction pharmaceuticals includes classes of compounds which are extensively applied to control human and veterinary infections 1 3 the major part of these pharmaceuticals are not completely metabolized inside human and animal bodies and consequently excreted as non metabolites or active metabolites via urine and or feces into the aquatic environment 1 4 5 other sources of inclusion of the pharmaceuticals into aquatic environment are disposal of expired pharmaceutical products and effluents from the pharmaceutical industries 4 one most important pharmaceutical is flumequine flu an antimicrobial agent of the fluoroquinolone family most frequently used to treat human and veterinary diseases 1 6 high amount of this drug is thus used in daily life throughout the world 6 flu is reportedly resistant to biodegradation and thus a high concentration of this drug is reported in the aquatic environment 1 7 pharmaceutical contamination in the aquatic environment leads to several issues such as bacterial resistance and hazardous effects on aquatic organisms and human beings 3 8 besides pharmaceuticals yield degradation products dps in the aquatic environment which are also reported to be of environmental concern 3 this looks into developing highly efficient technologies for assessing toxicities of flu as well as its dps and their decontamination from contaminated water the metal oxides based semiconductor photocatalysts are gaining researcher s interest for decontamination of recalcitrant organic pollutants due to their potential practical applications and capability to trounce the pollutants 2 9 10 one important among these is cerium oxide ceo2 ceria a highly non toxic cheap and environmentally friendly photocatalyst which absorb light in the near uv region and also slightly in the visible region besides high band gap energy 10 the major drawback with the synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles is their stability and yield that limit their potential practical applications 11 the stability and yield of the ceria nps are controlled in this study using deep eutectic solvent des previous studies show that nanoparticles nps synthesized in ionic liquid il are mono dispersed and non agglomerated and consequently give highly stable nps with high yield 12 a recently introduced il analogue des that possesses outstanding characteristics such as cheap raw materials simple preparation procedure and biocompatibility is used in this study for the synthesis of ceria 13 the use of des as a solvent in the synthesis of nps is rarely explored the stability and yield of ceria in des as well as the degradation of flu using des ceria under uv c irradiation are explored in detail in this study since the wavelength of maximum absorption for flu falls in the range of uv c i e 200 280 nm the uv c irradiation illumination is expected to cause high removal of flu 6 besides due to high band gap energy the ceria np is expected to be easily activated by uv c and yield conduction band electrons i e ecb and valence band holes e g hvb that subsequently reacts in aqueous solution and produce hydroxyl radical oh as represented in reactions 1 4 14 1 c e o 2 h ν e c b h v b 2 e c b o 2 o 2 3 h v b h 2 o h o h 4 h v b o h o h the oh produced is a strong oxidant owing to its high oxidation potential and thus has high potential in destroying a wide range of recalcitrant water contaminants into less toxic and or harmless products 15 16 the oh reacts with organic compounds at a high rate in the range from 108 1010 m 1 s 1 through three different ways e g h abstraction reaction electron transfer reaction and addition to the unsaturated bond 16 17 in this study ceria nps were synthesized in des and acetic acid solvents and thereafter comparison of yield morphological structural and optical properties of the as synthesized materials were investigated using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy

using different ph of an aqueous solution the stability and efficiency of the photocatalyst was investigated in term of leaching of cerium ions and degradation of flu for different treatment cycles reactivity of flu with oh has been investigated through competition kinetic and radical scavenger studies the effects of different initial concentrations of flu natural water parameters such as inorganic anions cl no3 no2 so4 2 co3 2 hco3 and natural organic matter nom have been studied in detail the proposed degradation pathways of flu were established from the nature of dps identified toc removal of flu and toxicity evaluation of flu as well as its dps were assessed 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and reagents flu methanol tartaric acid dipiclonic acid boric acid ammonium acetate

preparation of all the experimental solutions used in this study 2 2 synthesis of des des is a mixture of two safe and cheap constituents that are capable to form a homogeneous composition one of the two constituents is a hydrogen bond donor hbd and the other is hydrogen bond acceptor hba and the synthesis can be confirmed by lowering of melting point of des as compared to its individual constituents 18 in this case des was formed by mixing ctab cetyltrimethylammonium bromide with acetic acid in 1 1 ratio by mass at 70 c for 3 h in a round bottom flask fitted under a condenser to form a homogeneous mixture acetic acid was used as hbd and ctab as an hba it was solidified below 70 c which differed from the melting points of the individual constituents 19 20 fig s1 supportive information shows the diagrammatic representation of the synthesis of des and the nature of bonds existing between the constituents 2 3 synthesis of cerium oxide nanoparticles the synthesis of ceria nps was done by mixing 10 ml isopropyl alcohol 10 ml ethylene glycol and 0 3 g ammonium cerium iv nitrate that formed red solution to this solution 1 0 ml of molten des was added drop wise under vigorous stirring after stirring for 2 0 h the resulting solution was changed into a uniform transparent solution this solution was taken in teflon lined hydrothermal autoclave and placed in the oven for 7 0 h at 130 c when it was cooled to room temperature the greenish brown mixture was obtained the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min the unreacted solvents were collected to recycle the nanoparticles obtained after centrifugation was washed 3 times with ethanol and once with acetone to get the dried samples 2 4 characterization of cerium oxide nanoparticles fourier transform infrared

activity of the cerium oxide nanoparticles i e des ceria des ceo2 and ceria ceo2 at an initial concentration of 0 5 g l was investigated to degrade flu 10 mg l in aqueous solution under uv c irradiation for different times from 0 to 120 min except 360 min in case of toc removal before exposure to irradiation an aqueous solution of flu containing des ceria and ceria was kept for 30 min to establish adsorption desorption equilibrium the solution was then exposed to uv c irradiation emitting from a photochemical reactor enclosed in a box as shown in scheme 1 the source was started each day 20 min before treatment and a fan was fitted in the box to prevent heating of the aqueous solution the source was consisting of two 15 w low pressure mercury lamps emitting light at the wavelength of 253 7 nm a calibrated uv c source with a fluence rate of 0 1 mw cm2 was used in this study 4 the uv fluence for the treatment time of 120 min was calculated to be 720 mj cm2 in order to ensure consistent emission of radiation from the source a calibrated radiometer model il 1700 xrd xrl 140t254 low profile germicidal probe international light co newburyport ma was used to check regularly the fluence rate of the reactor the ph of the reactor solutions was adjusted using 0 05 m naoh and hclo4 after each uv c treatment 150 ml of the reaction sample was taken and mixed with the same volume of oh quenching agent i e methanol prior to analysis with hplc the photochemical treatment of flu was repeated for three times and to represent standard errors of the mean error bars were put on each figure 2 6 analytical methods hplc 1200 series agilent technologies was used to analyze the concentration of flu in the irradiated solutions the hplc used in this experiment was equipped with quaternary pump eclipse xdb c18 column 150 4 6 mm 5 μm particle size and a variable wavelength detector vwd set at 250 nm for the analysis of flu by hplc the mobile phase used was acetonitrile methanol and acetic acid 1 in the ratio v v of 30 30 and 40 respectively at a flow rate 1 0 ml min the dps of flu under uv c only and uv c with the photocatalysts were analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms waters corp usa the uplc ms ms using c18 column 2 1 mm 50 mm particle size 1 7 μm quattro premier xe tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer and

the analysis by uplc ms ms and analysis was performed by electrospray interface esi set at full scan mode from m z 50 to 500 the hplc method reported in our earlier published work was used for estimating the concentration of p cba used in the competition kinetic study 21 the analysis of ionic products i e fluoride f and acetate ch3co2 in irradiated aqueous solutions of flu was done by ion chromatograph ic metrohm 800 series with electrical conductivity ec detector the analysis of the ionic products were performed using metrosep asupp 5 250 4 0 mm column and 3 2 mm na2co3 1 mm nahco3 50 mm h2so4 water as the mobile phase the concentration of cerium ions discharged from des ceria and ceria in a treated aqueous solution of flu was estimated by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas perkinelmer aa800 toc analyzer schimadzu vcsh asi was used for the analysis of total organic carbon toc in treated flu solutions following the method from our previous published work 22 2 7 ecotoxicity estimation the ecological structure activity relationship ecosar an efficient toxicity predictive program based on the use of structure activity relationships sars was used to estimate ecotoxicities as a function of acute and chronic toxicities of flu and its dps 23 the study is useful to test the potential and usefulness of the tested treatment technologies the ecosar was used to test acute and chronic toxicities of flu and its dps towards three aquatic organisms e g fish daphnia and green algae the flu and its dps having molecular weight mw 1000 easily meet the applicability of ecosar the lc50 and ec50 were used to measure the acute toxicities of flu and its dps while chronic toxicities were estimated as a function of chv 23 3 results and discussions 3 1 ftir analysis of des ftir analysis was done to study the chemical and physical combination of the constituents with the help of characteristic peaks of acetic acid for the carboxyl group co and coh that are shown at 1706 and 3000 cm 1 24 whereas characteristic peaks of ctab at 908 1473 2850 and 2915 cm 1 belong to cyanide group and scissoring mode symmetric stretching and asymmetric stretching of ch2 respectively 25 since des is the simple homogeneous mixture of acetic acid and ctab that s why des spectrum contained all ctab and acetic acid prominent peaks change of sharpness broadening and intensity of ftir peaks represent the hydrogen bonding effect 26 in des spectra the lesser intensity of peak was observed at 1706 cm 1 whereas the peak at 3000 cm 1 disappeared as compared to acetic acid spectra strongly indicate the presence of hydrogen bonding fig 1 a shows the ftir spectra for des as well as the constituents of des 3 2 des mediated synthesis of ceria nps in synthesis two types of solvents acetic acid and des ctab acetic acid were used ctab a known cationic surfactant was used in the synthesis of nanoparticles which helps in providing sufficient stabilization to the nanoparticles 27 similarly acetic acid has the stabilizing effect on nanoparticles therefore a combination of ctab and acetic acid in the form of des will enhance the stabilization of ceria nps with a higher yield the literature reported method 28 was used in the case of acetic acid which results in 0 06 g of ceria while for des mediated 0 117 g yield of ceria was obtained from the same molar ratios of the starting materials furthermore the des contained solvent was recycled for the synthesis of the second cycle of ceria which was 0 11 g yield 3 3 characterization of ceria and des ceria ftir spectra of ceria and des ceria that is ranging from 4000 to 600 cm 1 is shown in fig 1b the peaks at 888 cm 1 1024 cm 1 and 1347 cm 1 belong to the bending and stretching vibrations of co coc and ch respectively these groups come from the precursors used in the synthesis of both ceria nps 29 31 the peaks at 1416 cm 1 1649 cm 1 and 1539 cm 1 indicate hoh bending vibration as the moisture is absorbed by the particles 32 the peak at 1067 cm 1 is for the oceo stretching vibrations 31 33 the curve peak at 3305 cm 1 is for oh stretching of the water molecules absorbed 34 the ftir spectra of both ceria and the des ceria are identical and had the same characteristic peaks which confirm that both the prepared materials are the same moreover the spectral patterns of the prepared ceria are the same as reported in the literature 31 34 x ray diffraction spectroscopic analysis was performed to study the crystal structure and grain size of ceria and des ceria using the scan range between 20 70 radiation voltage 30 kv current 20 ma and the scan rate of 0 030 s the xrd profile exhibited four 04 diffraction peaks observed at 28 56 32 81 47 13 and 56 20 with planes corresponding to 112 201 214 and 311 facets of des ceria and pristine ceria fig 1c the xrd diffraction peaks were completely indexed to the cubic structure of ceria nanoparticles with jcpds card no 98 010 5736 moreover both the xrd spectra also did not reflect the presence of any peak of impurity which further verified the formation of single phase crystals 35 the crystal size of the des ceria and pristine ceria was calculated using debye scherrer equation eq 5 5 d k λ β c o s θ where d k λ β and cosθ represents crystal size dimensionless shape factor wavelength of x rays line broadening at half of the maximum gained intensity and bragg angles given in degrees the parameters estimated from xrd analysis for des ceria and ceria are given in table 1 fig 1d depicts the raman spectra of the des ceria and ceria nps showing peak at 455 cm 1 which is attributed to the symmetrical stretching mode of ceo8 vibrational unit 36 this vibrational mode is the typical raman active one for the fluorite crystal structure where oxygen atoms vibrate symmetrically around the cation in literature a raman active mode peak has been observed at 464 cm 1 for bulk ceria 37 the peaks observed at 455 cm 1 in this study results from downshifting the only allowed first order f2g mode of the bulk crystal at 464 cm 1 38 shifting in line position along with noteworthy asymmetry and line broadening is common to both des ceria and ceria the broadness of the peak in the case of des ceria indicates the lowering of the particle size in the presence of des the absence of any peak at around 585 600 cm 1 corroborates for an almost defect free ceria 39 the sem edx analysis was performed to investigate the morphology and elemental composition of ceria and des ceria nanoparticles as shown in fig 1e a b even though the particles are attached to each other by the grain boundary to form the agglomerates but the nanoparticles formed by the hydrothermal method have uniform distribution 40 in both cases the particles are spherical with varying sizes in the ranges of 20 90 nm of average particle size 55 nm the particle size variation was attributed to the formation of agglomerates because of the magnetic effect of the nanoparticles 41 the edx analysis gives the elemental composition of ceria and des ceria both the samples contain ce o and c as shown in fig 1e a b and table 2 both des ceria and ceria have similar elemental composition which confirms the purity of the samples the presence of c might be either from the sem carbon tape or the starting materials used in the synthesis of both ceria nps or due to some remnants from the synthesis fig 1f a b depicts the hrtem images of ceria and des ceria it can be seen that ceria is agglomerated in nature fig 1f a and have low crystallinity compared to des ceria fig 1f b the fringes observed in fig 1f a b provides the crystallographic spacing of the ceria crystallites the fringes that are frequently observed in fig 1f a b corresponds to 111 and 200 crystallographic planes of ceria cerianite phases the high crystallinity of des ceria could be due to the reason that des did not allow ceria particles to encounter each other and thus reduces the chances of ceria particles to agglomerate particle growth hindering fig 1g a and g b depicts the tga and dtg analysis of ceria and des ceria nanoparticles respectively the first weight loss attributed to the removal of adsorbed water vapors on the surface of the ceria and des ceria nps this weight loss was observed below 100 c i e approximately 5 in the tga curve fig 1g a and is also indicated by the dtg curve in fig 1g b the weight loss of 3 5 assigned to organic residual compounds were degraded 42 43 between 100 225 c which was also indicated by the dtg curve centered at 78 c and 207 c for the ceria and at 64 c and 218 c for the des ceria the weight loss related to the decomposition of ceria was increased by increasing the temperature from 225 c to 500 c and approximately 15 weight was lost in both the cases 31 33 in comparison the des ceria nps t max 350 c were more stable as compare to ceria t max 260 c this increase in thermal stability of ceria nps in the presence of des ought to enhance electrochemical stability the n2 adsorption desorption of the as synthesized ceria and des ceria was analyzed using micromeritics as shown in fig 1h and textural properties such as brunauer emmett teller bet surface area barrett joyner halenda bjh pore size and pore volume were determined as shown in table 3 the surface area pore size and pore volume were 130 2 m2 g 3 6 nm and 0 12 cm3 g for the des ceria and 87 3 m2 g 4 07 nm 0 092 cm3 g for the ceria table 3 the results showed that des mediation of ceria led to increased porosity and surface area compared to other method of syntheses where surface area is much lower 44 45 the high surface area and small pore size suggests the mesoporous nature of the synthesized solid adsorbent materials 46 the high surface area and small pore size suggest the high adsorption efficiency of des ceria as compared to ceria 3 4 the photocatalytic performance of des ceria and ceria the photocatalytic performance of des ceria and ceria was investigated towards degradation of flu under five different conditions e g des ceria only ceria only uv c only uv c des ceria and uv c ceria in case of des ceria only and ceria only aqueous solution of flu was treated for 2 h time corresponding to 720 mj cm2 the result shows 50 35 33 94 and 73 removal of flu by des ceria only ceria only uv c only uv c des ceria and uv c ceria respectively fig 2 a the removal by des ceria only and ceria only could be due to accumulation of flu on the surface of the photocatalysts since both des ceria and ceria have high surface areas and consequently high accumulation of the flu molecules are expected on the surface of the photocatalysts the high removal efficiency of flu by des ceria than ceria was possibly due to the much higher surface area of the former i e 130 18 m2 g than the later i e 87 32 m2 g that ensures better accessibility of the target molecule to the active sites the treatment by uv c only also resulted in significant removal of the flu i e 33 which was possibly due to absorption of uv c photons by the target contaminant its consequent excitation and degradation of the excited molecule into dps after passing through several physical and chemical processes as shown in reactions 6 8 6 f l u h v f l u 7 f l u i n t e r m e d i a t e s 8 i n t e r m e d i a t e s d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t s the significant improvement in the removal of flu by uv c des ceria and uv c ceria could be due to the involvement of reactive oxygen species in the presence of uv c the photocatalysts yield primarily ecb and hvb that reacts further in aqueous solution and give oh reactions 1 4 the oh produced readily attack flu and caused its degradation into dps as depicted in reactions 9 and 10 9 f l u o h i n t e r m e d i a t e s 10 i n t e r m e d i a t e s d e g r a d a t i o n p r o d u c t s the scavengers studies using copper ion cu2 formic acid hco2h and tert butyl alcohol t buoh as the quenching agents for ecb hvb and oh respectively were done to investigate ecb and hvb contribution in the yield of oh as well as assess the oh role in degradation of the flu 2 9 the results as shown in fig 2b depicts that the addition of hco2h and t buoh inhibited the degradation of flu by des ceria and ceria while addition of cu2 showed very minimal influence since hvb reacts in water and yield oh thus scavenging of hvb inhibit the rate of oh formation 2 9 similarly t buoh reacts very fast with oh 47 thus presence of t buoh could inhibit reactivity of oh with the target contaminant and consequently retarded the removal of flu in our study on contrary in the presence of cu2 that was used to quench ecb minimal effect on the degradation of flu was observed which also supported the contribution of hvb in the yield of oh this study showed that the rate of formation of oh and also reactivity of oh with flu play vital role in the degradation of flu by uv c des ceria and uv c ceria the second order rate constant of oh with flu k o h f l u was estimated by the method of competition kinetic as discussed in our previous study 16 and k o h f l u was calculated to be 5 7 109 m 1 s 1 the high second order rate constant value also suggests fast reactivity of oh with flu and thus factors that affect this reactivity could inhibit degradation of flu since des ceria showed high surface area and consequently rendered high adsorption of the target contaminant thus high removal of flu was observed in uv c des ceria than uv c ceria 3 5 cyclic performance of des ceria and ceria as well as leaching of ce ions this study is beneficial to suggest potential practical applications and greenness of the as synthesized photocatalyst for removal of emerging water pollutants the removal of flu by uv c des ceria and uv c ceria was investigated for six consecutive cycles and removal efficiency obtained are shown in fig 3 the removal efficiency of flu was dropped from 94 at first cycle to 68 at six cycle in the uv c des ceria while the removal efficiency of flu dropped from 73 at first cycle to 25 at six cycle in the case of uv c ceria the greater decline in removal efficiency of flu in the case of uv c ceria depicts lower stability of the ceria than des ceria this study suggests that the use of des besides enhancing yield and efficiency also enhances the stability of the photocatalysts further the analysis of cerium ions was conducted in aqueous solutions of flu treated with uv c des ceria and uv c ceria to assess stability and greenness of the photocatalyst the concentrations of ce ions discharged from the photocatalysts were analyzed in aqueous solution for each cycle and found to be 0 03 mg l for des ceria and 0 1 mg l for ceria at sixth cycle the lower concentrations of cerium ions discharged into aqueous solution suggest the des ceria to be highly stable as well as environmentally friendly and was thus highly recommended for treatment of emerging water pollutants the high efficiency enhanced stability and greenness attract performance of the des ceria to be further investigated in detail in the following studies 3 6 influence of operational parameters effects of ph ph play vital role in photocatalytic degradation of water pollutants as change in ph influence charge on the surface of the photocatalyst redox potential of reactive oxygen species chemistry of the target contaminant and electrostatic interaction between the charge on the surface of the photocatalyst and that on the target contaminant 9 48 thus the removal of flu by des ceria under uv c was investigated at different ph i e 2 8 6 8 8 7 and 11 3 while keeping initial concentrations of flu and the photocatalyst constant the point of zero charge of des ceria was calculated by drift method and found to be 7 1 which was in close agreement to the previously reported value 49 50 the point of zero charge value suggest the surface of the photocatalyst to be positively charged at acidic ph excessive h and negatively charged at alkaline ph excessive oh as proposed in eqs 11 and 12 11 c e o h h c e o h 2 12 c e o h o h c e o h 2 o the pka value of 6 5 for flu suggest the flu represented here by ha at ph 6 5 to be partially dissociated into anionic a form in a medium of ph 6 5 while cationic h2a form in a medium of ph 6 5 as shown in eqs 13 and 14 respectively 7 13 ha o h a h 2 o p h 6 5 14 ha h h 2 a p h 6 5 in our study maximum removal of flu i e 94 was achieved at ph 6 8 followed by 82 at ph 8 7 while removal of flu was least at ph 11 3 i e 35 and ph 2 8 e g 43 as shown in fig 4 a the values of point of zero charge and pka suggest that both des ceria and flu surfaces bear negative charge at highly alkaline ph while cationic charge at highly acidic ph and consequently undergo electrostatic repulsion reactions at these ph conditions the electrostatic repulsion led to minimum accumulation of flu on the surface of the photocatalyst and consequently inhibited removal of flu at highly acidic and basic ph conditions in our study the scavenging of oh by excessive oh as shown in reaction 15 and decrease in oxidation potential of oh at high alkaline ph are other possible reasons for lower removal of fu at high ph 2 15 o h o h o h 2 o k 61 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 a t a l k a l i n e p h the possible reason for maximum removal of flu at weak alkaline condition i e ph 8 7 is the generation of sufficient oh as shown in reaction 16 2 16 h v b o h o h effects of initial concentrations of flu the photocatalytic degradation of flu by des ceria under uv c irradiation was investigated employing different initial concentrations of flu i e 2 5 5 0 10 and 20 mg l while keeping other conditions such as dose of photocatalyst and ph constant the results show decline in removal efficiency of flu with elevating the level of flu and maximum removal of flu was observed at flu 0 2 5 mg l while minimum at flu 0 20 mg l fig 4b the most possible reasons for the lowering in removal efficiency with increasing flu 0 looked to be 1 the contest between flu molecules for oh that could be maximum at high level of flu 2 the contest between flu and its dps for oh that might be high at high flu 0 3 at high concentration the absorption of uv c irradiation by the target contaminant and the oxidant might inhibit and consequently affect the rate of formation of oh and 4 competition for adsorption sites between the target contaminant molecules that could be high at high concentration of flu and consequently lower the adsorptive removal of the flu at its high concentration 9 16 51 52 effects of dose of des ceria the purpose of this study was to know optimum level of the photocatalyst for maximum removal of flu while keeping other parameters i e flu 0 and ph constant from the experimental results achieved the removal efficiency of flu was found to be 50 67 80 and 94 at des ceria 0 of 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 g l respectively at a reaction time of 120 min under uv c irradiation fig 4c the enhanced removal efficiency of flu at high des ceria 0 could be attributed to the high rate of formation of oh and availability of more active sites for the adsorption of flu molecules at high dose of des ceria 9 52 3 7 effects inorganic anions and nom the potential of des ceria to treat pollutants in water containing different additives aqueous solutions of flu were spiked with natural water parameters such as inorganic anions i e cl no3 no2 so4 2 co3 2 and hco3 and nom and treated with des ceria under uv c irradiation the results show that removal of flu by des ceria under uv c irradiation was decreased in the order of no2 co3 2 nom hco3 cl so4 2 no3 table 4 the possible reasons for the decline in removal efficiency of flu in the presence of the inorganic anions and nom could be attributed to the competition for adsorption sites and oh between inorganic anions and or nom and flu molecules 9 47 the maximum inhibition of flu removal by no2 and co3 2 among the inorganic anions looked to be due to

oh both these inorganic anions are expected to compete greatly with flu for oh and consequently caused higher inhibition of the degradation of flu in our study and was consistent to the trend observed in previous studies 9 47 besides co3 2 boost ph of the aqueous solution and as discussed earlier in the ph effects study the high ph declined degradation of flu by uv c des ceria the addition of nom also suppressed removal of flu in our study which was possibly due its fast kinetic with oh reaction 19 and consequently greater competition with flu for oh 19 o h n o m p r o d u c t s k 2 23 10 8 m 1 s 1 the removal of flu by des ceria under uv c was suppressed at slightly lower rate than no2 and co3 2 though nom has high kinetic with oh the most possible reason looked to be the formation of reactive species from photolysis of nom and their participation in the removal of flu 53 the possible reasons for the inhibition in removal of flu in the presence of hco3 looked to be due to its scavenging of oh reaction 20 and also boost in ph of aqueous solution 9 47 20 o h h c o 3 h 2 o c o 3 k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 furthermore the addition of cl inhibited the degradation of flu by des ceria under uv c irradiation but at lower rate despite its fast kinetics with oh reaction 21 the reaction between cl and oh results in the formation of secondary reactive species as shown in reactions 21 24 and these might participate in the degradation of flu 2 47 21 c l o h c l o h k 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 22 c l o h c l o h k 6 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 23 c l o h c l o h k 6 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 24 c l h 2 o h o c l h k 2

that is important for potential practical applications of the tested technologies 53 54 the study for removal of toc of the flu was performed at high uv fluence i e 2160 mj cm2 6 0 h under the conditions of high concentrations of flu and des ceria i e flu 0 40 mg l and des ceria 0 1 0 g l as mineralization is a multistep and complex process 53 55 at a uv fluence of 2160 mj cm2 88 toc removal of the flu was achieved by des ceria under uv c as compared to 27 by uv c only fig 5 the results depict the uv c mediated des ceria to be highly efficient in the remediation of flu also 3 9 analysis of flu by products and developing proposed degradation pathways the proposed degradation pathways of flu by ceria under uv c irradiation were developed from the pattern of the degradation of flu and the dps analyzed by uplc ms ms and are presented in fig 6 the uplc ms ms analysis showed formation of total eleven dps of flu two by uv c while nine due to uv c mediated des ceria and ceria processes fig 6 the dps were identified from the ms search library installed in the uplc ms ms and ms spectra of some of the dps are provided in fig s2 a c in case of uv c only the photoexcited flu molecule undergo initially defluorination and hydroxylation leading to the formation of dp1 which further undergoe series of reactions following decarboxylation and form dp2 as shown in scheme i of the fig 6 the dps formed as a consequence of the oh attack on flu are mainly via substitution and elimination reactions 1 addition to the unsaturated bond electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction reactions as shown in scheme ii and scheme iii fig 6 56 the degradation product dp3 in scheme ii was observed because of the decarboxylation and electron abstraction from n followed by ring opening at n c position and has been reported in previous relevant study too 6 furthermore addition of oh to the unsaturated double bond converted dp3 into dp4 which was then converted into dp5 through defluorination and hydroxylation the attack of oh on the co group of the dp5 led to the formation of dp6 through decarboxylation moreover h abstraction from the carbon of the ring bearing nh group and hydroxylation form dp7a while h abstraction from the carbon bearing oh group followed by dehydrogenation led to the formation of dp7b the dp8 was formed from dp7a through the loss of side chain bearing methyl group scheme iii in fig 6 depicts formation of dp9 through attack of oh on flu involving defluorination reaction 57 and the dp9 subsequently transform into dp10 through decarboxylation reaction 7 the defluorination reaction in the conversion of flu into dps was confirmed from the analysis of f by ic in aqueous solution of flu treated by uv c only and uv c with ceria and des ceria further the aqueous solutions of flu treated with uv c and uv c with ceria nps were analyzed for other anionic products and analyzed formation of acetate in uv c des ceria and uv c ceria the formation of acetate suggests the breakdown of flu and its dps into smaller fragments and also proved mineralization of flu 3 10 toxicities evaluation of flu and its dps the potential of treatment process in degradation of water pollutants depends on the toxicity reduction of the treated solution as the dps can sometime be more toxic than the contaminant itself in this regard the procedure proposed by the european union and chinese hazard evaluation for new chemical species e g compound showing low chronic and acute toxicity value mg l divulge high toxic nature based on the use of ecosar program was followed to check the toxicity level of flu and its dps towards aquatic organisms fish daphnia and green algae 3 23 58 different toxicity levels were shown by flu and its dps towards all the investigated aquatic organisms table 5 the toxicity levels of most of the dps were higher than flu and emergence of such dps necessitate more research to evaluate toxicities of dps along with the parent compound as well as abate their toxicities through adjusting photocatalytic degradation controlling parameters and consequently develop safe green route the formation of acetate as the end product of the treatment suggests the final product of flu degradation to be non toxic 9 4 conclusions in this study it was concluded that the use of des gave high yield of ceria and the des ceria proved highly stable environmentally friendly and efficient in the degradation of flu the detailed characterization showed the synthesized ceria nps in des to be highly mesoporous and crystalline and showed small size with uniform surface the des ceria showed high photocatalytic degradation of flu and this removal was dependent on ph 0 flu 0 and photocatalyst 0 as well as on the presence of co existing anions and nom the dps of flu were detected by uplc ms ms and degradation pathways were proposed from the pattern of degradation of flu and nature of identified dps most of the dps showed high toxicity than parent compound which open new windows for researchers to investigate toxicities of degradation products of pharmaceuticals along with the parent compounds the formation of non toxic acetate product suggests the usefulness of the treatment process in detoxification of target contaminant the photocatalyst synthesized in des showed best performance even after six cycles the ceria nps synthesized in des is suggested to be highly economical feasible and efficient for the photodegradation of flu declaration of competing interest the authors do not have any conflict of
