20360,by using the latest generation atmospheric reanalysis dataset era5 from the european centre for medium range weather forecast a numerical wave simulation system based on swan model for the western shelf of the yellow sea ys is established a thorough calibration is conducted in order to satisfy both modeling accuracy and computational efficiency technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis analysis is used to determine the optimal choice from heterogeneous options of source terms jassens s formulas for wind input and whitecapping and jonswap s formula for bottom frictional dissipation are found most suitable wave parameters and wave spectra from buoy records and satellite observations are combined for model validation results indicate that the era5 reanalysis wind outperforms its early generation era interim for offsetting the underestimated wave heights bias decreases by up to 42 and wave period bias decreases by up to 7 for the inner shelf era5 is found better reproducing the extreme wave simulation whereas could also cause slight overestimation on the shoals for the breeze induced wind seas due to the complex bathymetry of the western inner shelf of the ys calibrated bottom friction coefficients vary for winter and summer which could be relevant to the different directions of the prevailing winds keywords wave simulation era5 era interim yellow sea topsis analysis swan model calibration 1 introduction the fifth generation atmosphere reanalysis dataset era5 from the european centre for mesoscale weather forecasts ecmwf has been recently released from the copernicus climate change service the era5 dataset was established on the assimilation of conventional and satellite observations from the 28 atmospheric assimilation system aas and provides global users with reanalysis of 29 numerical atmospheric forecasts over the earth it embodies a detailed record of the global atmosphere land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards with 29 numerical atmospheric products covering the earth this new dataset is now gradually replacing its predecessor era interim era5 is officially deemed superior to era interim from several aspects 1 model development in physics and core dynamics 2 more available data of assimilation 3 enhanced spatial resolution of 31 km as compared to 80 km and 4 1 hourly output as compared to 6 hourly output of era interim hersbach et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 osinski and radtke 2020 question arises does era5 really performs better than era interim for wind and wave sea hindcast the confidence on the applicability of this newly released database is in urgent needs particularly for regional use the era interim dataset is upgraded from the earlier era 15 and era 40 products by coupling atmospheric oceanic and terrestrial models it uses 4d var assimilation techniques with combination of improved humidity analysis and satellite data error correction techniques to improve the quality of reanalytical data the validity of era interim has been extensively verified by practitioners for instance chen et al 2016 through comparative analysis pointed out that the era interim is in good agreement with the observations from china s coastal stations whilst era5 is supposed to be even better than era interim for its enhanced wind quality rivas and stoffelen 2019 analyzed the differences between the era interim and era5 surface wind fields over a global scale relative to the advanced scatterometer wind observations they concluded that the era5 winds act very similar to the era interim winds except for a 20 improvement in 10 m wind speed on average dullaart et al 2020 suggested that the corresponding strong 10 m winds in tropical cyclones on a global scale shall be greatly improved since the root mean square errors rmses in tropical cyclones wind speeds reduce by 58 in era5 as compared to era interim studies in the artic by graham et al 2019 also confirms the advancing wind fields by era5 out of other era products however most recently the era5 s reliability has been challenged giusti et al 2020 yukiharu 2020 for example soon after the release of the era5 s back extension 1950 1978 giusti et al 2020 pointed out that era5 overestimates the intensity of tropical cyclones and consequently leads a rejection to the observed storm winds however before these reports one may notice that era5 surpasses era interim since it encompasses finer physical expression for tropical cyclones sourced from the international best track archive for climate stewardship knapp et al 2010 which is confirmed in the northwest pacific ocean li and hu 2021 apart from the large biases observed in winds from era5 the overestimation was also observed in waves for instance bruno et al 2020 showed the overestimation by the era5 s reanalysis wave dataset on the swells heights off the southern oman coast in the western arabian sea coincidently in a study of the long term wave climate estimation in the indian ocean naseef and kumar 2020 found consistently large biases based on the era5 reanalysis wave dataset on the contradictory yukiharu 2020 pointed out that era5 would underestimate the significant wave height h s and wave period t for large waves in the coastal area around japan as compared to the buoy measurements they suggested that the accuracy of the era5 wave reanalysis vibrates in fetch unlimited and fetch limited conditions the evident uncertainties aroused from limited existing studies in marginal seas around japan eager corporations on the assessment of the feasibility of era5 in the adjacent seas such as yellow sea ys in the western pacific ocean marginal seas are focused area for coastal and offshore engineering development oceanic carriage and oceanic hazard prediction which are of prominent importance to anthropogenic activities the era5 reanalysis wave dataset generated based on wind fields with 31 km 31 km spatial resolution and output on 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution is too coarse to satisfy the high resolution request for regional studies thus reproduction of wave climate by using the wind reanalysis data with a state of the art wave model is often a necessary the accuracy of the wave hindcast is very vulnerable to atmospheric and oceanic data sources as both of which are subject to the complexity of nearshore lateral and bottom boundary conditions besides the reliability of regional wave simulation also depends on how well the calibration of wave model goes since the physics in oceanic waves are getting complex in the marginal seas many previous wave hindcast studies pointed out that the default setup of a wave model such as simulating waves nearshore swan a third generation wave model developed at delft university of technology often fails to accommodate the validation of model covering their study regimes akpınar et al 2021 bingölbali et al 2019 liang et al 2019 in addition the source terms contributing to the wave genesis are highly sensitive to water depth for the offshore region quadruplet wave interaction and white capping dissipation are more influential while bottom friction dissipation triad wave wave interaction and depth induced breaking are significant in shallow waters such as the western inner shelf yellow sea ys from shandong to the south end of jiangsu coast e g chen et al 2016 chen et al 2016 further showed that whitecapping dissipation s w c and quadruplet wave wave interaction s n l 4 are critical in leading to the seasonal variation of wave climate in most areas of the ys in view of this in case of the same wind forcing is imposed on the wave model without model calibration the reliability of the output can be quite spatially different swan makes input parameters and choices of the empirical functions for physics resolution all flexible for users thus through careful calibration an accurate modelling system targeted at a specific region can be achieved liang et al 2014 however the parametrization of swan has always been a challenge firstly one needs to determine the most important parameters to be adjusted vledder et al 2000 noted that by carefully adjusting s w c deficits in wave simulation caused by s n l 4 can be compensated allahdadi et al 2019 found parameters in the s w c are much more influential than the initial parameters such as directional standard deviation number of spectral frequencies number of iterations time step etc via a detailed calibration work for wave simulation on the continental shelf of the east coast of the united states while in a study focused on the mackenzie delta xu et al 2013 parameters in shallow water dissipation processes such as selections of reasonable breaking index and bottom friction coefficient matter more for developing a rational wave model second even with the primary source term determined there lefts multiple choices of empirical formulas to be parameterized for example akpınar et al 2016 conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the source term parameterization in order to find the optimal expressions for s i n and s w c they showed komen and hasselmann 1984 and janssen 1991 s formulas tend to underestimate the wave period a more pioneering work done by van der westhuysen et al 2007 pointed out the above two formulas could underestimate the low frequency part of the wave energy and hence account for the underprediction of wave period to solve these shortcomings van der westhuysen et al 2007 implemented a modified version of the expression for white capping dissipation based on the work of alves and banner 2003 with careful calibration alves and banner 2003 s method used local saturation in wave spectra instead of averaged spectral parameters the method has been successfully applied to many mixed sea states and often has shown better performances mulligan et al 2008 van der westhuysen et al 2007 however most of these applications were associated with environments of limited wind fetches and short wind durations such as inland lakes semi enclosed bays harbors and other small scale coastal areas allahdadi et al 2018 whether alves and banner 2003 can perform better than komen and hasselmann 1984 along an open coast such as the western inner shelf of ys still waits for further evaluations apart from the complexity in calibrating s i n and s w c there also exists multiple empirical formulas for calculating bottom friction induced wave dissipation s b o t hasselmann et al 1973 collins 1972 madsen et al 1988 however since the seafloor conditions type of submarine material roughness sand ripple s height etc are quite distinct from place to place choices of the formulas for calculating s b o t are quite debating hernández and monbaliu 2001 siadatmousavi et al 2011 besides appropriate coefficients in the selected formula are also spatially dependent this study aims to establish a new wave hindcast system for the western inner shelf of the ys based on the upgraded ecmwf wind reanalysis data meanwhile the following two questions will be discussed a what is an optimal setup for swan model by using the era5 wind reanalysis data for wave hindcast b how well the era5 wind reanalysis data performs on the wave hindcast as compared to its precursor era interim these targets yield the major technical route of this study as shown in fig 1 in the following context section 2 introduces the study domain and the modeling setup section 3 provides detailed calibration and validation processes section 4 discusses the advantages and limitations by using era5 reanalysis wind dataset on regional wave hindcast based on swan model e g location seasonal wind the performance of ear5 and era interim reanalysis wind datasets and their feasibility on wave hindcasts on the ys will be compared the sensitivity of modeling accuracy due to certain physical parameters for wave simulation of typical weathers on the ys will be conducted in the following section 5 concludes the entire study 2 methods and measurements 2 1 study area the western shelf of ys is located in the mid latitude influenced by both northern and southern extreme weathers such as winter storms squall lines and tropical cyclones the entire coastline of the western shelf of the ys spans 954 km long and the coast can be roughly divided into two sections based on the beach types the sandy coast in the north and the silty coast in the south besides the inner shelf incorporates a complex aqueous delta so called the radial sand ridges rsr the rsr is shallow and sits between the sheyang estuary and the northern bank of the yangtze river estuary from 32 00 n to 33 48 n with jianggang as the apex the ridges radiate offshore in a folding fan form the rsr s periphery spans about 200 km and its radius is about 140 km seaward there are more than 70 shoals in this area such as dongsha jiangjiasha and yaosha these shoals vary in size and shape with deep grooves interlaced we adopt an unstructured grid for better describing the bathymetry of the rsr in swan which enables flexible local encryption scheme that can improve the accuracy of wave simulation for this particular area for covering a large scale wave climate the study domain covers the entire ys and the bohai sea spanning 117 e 128 e in longitude and 29 n 41 n in latitude see fig 2 the grid domain of the ys is composed with 33489 triangle cells and 17602 nodes bathymetric data is sourced from two datasets chart data for the jiangsu coastal area which is provided by the navigation guarantee department of the pla navy command and the topex bathymetric data https topex ucsd edu cgi bin get data cgi for the deep ocean out of the scope of the chart data the final bathymetric map presented here covers subtidal intertidal and supertidal areas up to 1 5 m above mean sea level m s l along the jiangsu coast and up to 30 45 m at the cliff dominated coasts around bohai sea and the eastern ys the depth of the deepest water is 154 8 m below the m s l on the offshore boundary the resolution of the chart data is about 3 km and the topex bathymetric resolution is 1 60 1 85 km in both latitude and longitude shoreline shapefile is built upon combined chart data and the digitalized shoreline from google earth in order to better express the shoreline curvature the lowest spatial resolution is set to 27 km on the offshore open boundaries and local encryption is carried out in the jiangsu coastal area with the highest spatial resolution set at 59 m at the apex of the rsr 2 2 swan wave model 2 2 1 model description swan is based on the dynamic spectral balance equation that integrates the effects of wind energy input bottom friction whitecapping dissipation wave breaking and nonlinear impacts the equation consists of the following terms 1 n t c x n x c y n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s σ 2 n e σ where σ represents the relative frequency and θ represents the wave propagation direction n σ θ is wave action spectrum e is wave energy spectrum and s is the total amount of source contributions the first five terms are the gradient of n over time t the gradient of n in geospatial coordinates varies with x and y directions and the gradient of n varies with σ and θ respectively c x c y c σ and c θ represent wave group s propagation velocity in x y σ and θ space respectively the total source term s is composed of whitecapping dissipation s w c bottom friction s b o t wave breaking s b r wave nonlinear interactions s n l 3 and s n l 4 and wind energy input s i n 3 s s w c s b o t s b r s n l 3 s n l 4 s i n the growth of waves s i n due to the action of wind can be described as a process in which the wind energy transforms into the wave field through the air sea interaction the wind input can be expressed as a sum of a linear growth component a phillips 1957 and an exponential growth component b e σ θ miles 1957 formulas are shown in appendix c in the earlier version of swan the expression for a is provided by cavaleri and rizzoli 1981 while the exponential growth term is offered various options komen and hasselmann 1984 yan 1987 and janssen 1991 in the latest version of swan model v41 31 empirical formulas for s i n are further updated apart from the traditional formulas proposed during 1980s 1990s a new formula proposed by rogers et al 2012 is included which can account for the impact from the oblique and counter vailing winds in the new formula rogers et al 2012 wind speed scale local dissipation coefficient and cumulative dissipation coefficient are all adjustable parameters in addition there exists three alternative formulas to adjust wind drag coefficient fan et al 2012 hwang et al 2011 and ecmwf in an earlier study done by amarouche et al 2019 on the wave simulation covering the mediterranean sea the importance of the selection of the wind drag formulas was highlighted in this study varied wind input sources will be tested in order to propose the optimal choice for wave hindcast in the ys with era5 wind reanalysis data the whitecapping term s w c and the bottom dissipation term s b o t are the two most important dissipation terms that can balance s i n there are four options for s w c included in swan v41 31 which are komen and hasselmann 1984 janssen 1991 alves and banner 2003 and babanin et al 2010 and three options for s b o t which are given by collins 1972 madsen et al 1988 and jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 in the following text calibration on s i n s b o t and s w c will be expanded and discussed the formulas for s w c and s b o t are provided in the appendix c 2 2 2 boundary forcing the open boundary of the ys wave model is driven with offshore swell forcing from the assimilated data obtained from the wwiii inversion provided by noaa allahdadi et al 2019 herman et al 2019 phillips 1957 rautenbach et al 2020 the significant wave height h s spectral peak period t p and mean wave direction θ m were imposed on the southeastern open boundary for the open boundary forcing the temporal resolution is 3 h the spatial resolution is of 0 5 the spectral peak factor γ is chosen as 3 3 and were initialized by the jonswap s spectra allahdadi et al 2019 the air sea boundary is driven by the wind forcing from the era5 reanalytical wind speed components u 10 m and v 10 m above the m s l as shown in table 1 the temporal and spatial resolution of era5 and era interim are different modelled regional waves from the two datasets were compared to the measurements in section 4 note for comparisons between the simulations with the two datasets input parameters were set as default for both models the feasibility of wwiii s boundary forcing has been verified in the previous studies in the western inner shelf of ys feng et al 2020 besides the main objective of this paper is to explore the feasibility of the era5 wind data such a procedure requires unilateral testing for example in a recent study beyramzadeh et al 2021 the ear5 reanalysis wave data is not used for boundary forcing in addition to this the feasibility of era5 wave dataset on boundary forcing is limited in the existing studies while the wwiii has been applied extensively bento et al 2018 li et al 2020 wang et al 2018 wu et al 2018 2 3 measured wind and wave data 2 3 1 stations and buoy based observations five wave buoys sitting at xiaomaidao xiangshui dafeng lengjiasha and leodo are used to validate the wave model for the inner shelf fig 2 b wind measurements including wind intensity and wind direction sourced from seven anemometer stations at xiaomaidao lianyungang dafeng lengjiasha lvsi liyashan and leodo are used to check the accuracy of era5 wind reanalysis data table 2 and table 3 conclude the information for the measurements 2 3 2 measurements from satellite altimeter dataset the satellite altimeter data are used for facilitating wave validation in the deep ocean the satellite dataset named as level 2 processing l2p and derived from ifremer globwave ifremer fr are employed in this study the dataset accommodates measurements from multiple satellites and only the data with verifiable values of 0 1 is used the verifiable values are divided into 3 levels in which 0 represents good measurement 1 represents okay for some applications 2 represents bad measurements the information of satellite dataset l2p is shown in table 4 3 numerical results 3 1 model calibration 3 1 1 initial parameters to start the initial parameters including directional standard deviation dsd number of spectral frequencies nf number of iterations nit and time step dt are firstly optimized specifically the model with different parameter inputs dsd nf nit dt is run to find optimal values while keeping the default values for all the other source parameters spectral peak period t p significant wave height h s average wave direction θ m and mean wave period t m are used in the calibration process the model results are compared against measurements at four buoy locations for october 2013 fig 3 the initial model parameters are selected based on the rmses minimization principle it is found that h s t m and t p are all insensitive to dsd the rmses at the three buoy stations are less than o 10 2 m for h s and less than 0 05 s for t m respectively the rmse is relatively larger for t p but mostly within 0 3 s the observed wave direction θ m is more sensitive to the parameter dsd the accuracy the offshore boundary is positively related to dsd however the condition with dsd 90 implies swells may dominate in the western innershelf of ys which does not comply with the reality in this study thus dsd is set as 90 table 5 concludes the initial parameters selected in this study similarly to dsd change in nf has little effect on wave height e g h s and wave period e g t m and t p for example with varied nfs rmses for t p can reach 0 84 s as shown in fig 3b the larger nf is the smaller variability of t p is similar conclusion can be seen for the other parameters although the variability is even smaller thus the upper bound nf 41 is selected for wave modelling the larger nit is taken the more model accuracy might be achieved whereas on the expense of longer computational time in order to find the optimal value for nit sensitive tests are conducted for nit 1 to 5 it is found nit 1 is far from satisfying as the rmses are the largest 0 12 m for h s 1 73 s for t p 0 48 s for t m and 71 83 for θ m respectively as nit increases rmses of the wave parameters decrease during the calibration process after the third iteration the rmses for h s and other wave parameters drop by at least 50 as compared nit 1 the model accuracy is largely increased however since too large a nit can cause too much computational time fig 3 e consequently nit is chosen as 4 to achieve model precision while maintaining the computational efficiency usually smaller dt enables more model stability since the model can better adapt to the changes of bathymetry or wind and wave field with decreased dt the rmses of the four wave parameters gradually decrease fig 3d as the computational time increases exponentially as dt decreases the edge value dt 10 min is selected for wave modelling the final selection of the initial parameters is concluded in table 5 detailed initial parameters calibration can be referred to supplemental information text s1 fig s1 3 1 2 wind energy input and whitecapping dissipation in the ys s w c is predominant among the wave dissipation sources fig 4 the shallow water terms s b o t s n l 3 and s b r are much weaker than s w c besides s i n as the main driver for waves in the ys also needs thorough calibration in the following sensitivity tests the four options for s i n komen and hasselmann 1984 abbreviated as kom and thereafter yan 1987 abbreviated as yan janssen 1991 abbreviated as jan and rogers et al 2012 abbreviated as rog are co evaluated with the options for s w c komen and hasselmann 1984 abbreviated as kom janssen 1991 abbreviated as jan and alves and banner 2003 abbreviated as ab and babanin et al 2010 abbreviated as bab in addition when calculating s i n with rogers et al 2012 three options for calculating wind drag coefficient hwang fan and ecmwf are also tested hwang is the default setting and sourced from hwang et al 2011 fan is from fan et al 2012 ecmwf follows the wam cycle 4 methodology table 6 lists all the combinations considered for s i n and s w c named as s i n s w c e g rogh ab represents s i n calculated by using rog with wind drag coefficient calculated from huang s formula and s w c calculated by using ab due to the massive number of tests technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis hwang and yoon 1981 is used to help with optimal combinations for choices of s i n and s w c topsis analysis ranks the performances of the wave model with heterogeneous combinations of formulas for calculating s i n and s w c based on scores from the comparisons between the swan outputs and the measurements topsis integrates multiple statistics including correlation coefficient r rmse and bias which are normalized for calculating the ranking score all the tests are based on the same time period to exclude weather induced uncertainties wave measurements from year 2013 at dafeng and xiangshui are then used for analysis swan outputs used for the topsis include the nth order of moment of the waves m 0 m 1 m 2 m 4 mean wave period t m significant wave height h s wave steepness stpm and spectral width ε shown in table 6 the model performance with s i n calculated using jan e g jan jan jan ab jan kom always ranks on the top three it turns out that in the ys the updated formulas such as rog for s i n or bab for s w c do not score higher than the traditional options such as jan or kom for both s i n or s w c besides among the three wind drag formulas huang underperforms fan and ecmwf ranking 11 16 vs 4 4 5 7 in this study wind drag coefficient from fan seems more suitable the formulas suggested by van der westhuysen et al 2007 as previously stated fail sometime for the large domain simulation or over long time span it is also noticed by the topsis that scores from jan jan and jan kom were very similar difference less than 10 4 according to allahdadi et al 2019 the two s w c formulas from kom and jan are essentially equivalent in the third mode of swan this is because the dissipation rate in kom s formula for s w c is independent of s t p m while in jan s formula the two parameters are integrated together to generate adjustable parameter c d s 1 shown by the topsis since janssen s formula for s i n jan with default values all lead to satisfying scores slight differences are sourced from varied options of s w c therefore in the following calibration we focus only on the parameterization of jan and ab for s w c the dissipation rate coefficient in s w c c d s 1 for jan and c d s 2 for ab plays an important role in s w c calibration modeling performance with varied dissipation rate coefficients is evaluated c d s 1 in jan is set from 1 5 to 7 5 at an interval of 1 0 and c d s 2 in ab ranges from 2 0e 5 to 8 0e 5 at an interval of 1 0e 5 the modelling performances sourced from varied c d s 1 and c d s 2 are compared through taylor program in the taylor program x axis shows the central root mean square error crmse y axis indicates relative standard deviation rsd and the central angle counted clock wisely from north indicates the correlation coefficient r all with reference to the observations detailed calculation for crmse rsd and r can be referred to the appendix b besides rmse and bias are also calculated in assistance to the parameterization the model performances from varied dissipation rate coefficients for jan or ab of s w c reveal limited differences for both nearshore and offshore stations fig 5 fig 6 in order to sort out the optimal values for the coefficients the elimination method is applied the coefficients causing larger rsd for h s validation are firstly screened out which gives a narrowing range 5 5 c d s 1 2 5 for jan and 4 0e 5 c d s 2 3 0e 5 for ab the offshore stations have better statistic scores than the nearshore stations with varied coefficients at the offshore stations consistently positive biases appear in h s and t p and the jan s formula with c d s 1 4 5 for s w c in general outperforms the results with other parameterizations at nearshore stations there is no clear trend during the calibration of s w c and statistical scores are slightly lower e g r2 0 7 for t m possible reasons could due to that s w c weights more in the deep ocean and the waves are largely influenced by local winds and bathymetry in the nearshore however for the open coast in the ys the nearshore wave climate is predominated by the offshore wave climate thus calibration on s w c is also necessary for the nearshore stations in this case finally jan s formula with c d s 1 3 5 is preferred because of the higher correlations achieved between the simulated and measured wave characteristics at the nearshore stations in addition to c d s 1 δ is the another coefficient in jan for s w c which determines the dependency of the whitecapping on wave number δ is between 0 and 1 with default value as 0 5 according to previous studies allahdadi et al 2019 amarouche et al 2019 siadatmousavi et al 2011 by decreasing δ the model enlarges s w c in the low frequency band and thus leads to smaller t m after testing δ 0 9 of jan is proposed for the model table 7 displays wave statistics for s i n and s w c jan c d s 1 3 5 δ 0 9 after the calibration as compared to the statistics from the default settings in swan s i n and s w c by using kom and default coefficient it is evident the model s performance is elevated after calibration with higher r reduced bias and decreased rmse for instance at lengjiasha station r increases from 0 75 to 0 78 and the bias in h s drops by approximately 0 05 m 3 1 3 bottom friction dissipation calibration in the following step s b o t are calibrated considering three options jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 collins 1972 and madsen madsen et al 1988 fig 7 compares the modelling performances on h s at different stations coefficient in jonswap formulation c j i o n was set to 0 028 0 048 and compared to its default value 0 038 for collins bottom friction coefficient c f w modeling results with c f w 0 015 and c f w 0 020 0 025 are compared the calibrated values of the two parameters are set within the normal ranges the equivalent roughness length scale of the bottom friction k n in madsen et al 1988 is dependent on the local sediment sizes after investigation on the sediments of the seabed along the western coast of ys k n is set to 3 125 mm 6 25 mm and 12 5 mm for calibration detailed investigation and determination on k n can be referred to appendix c the correlation coefficient r is consistently high at all the three stations r 0 85 except for lengjiasha during summer time with different formulas nevertheless the scores of the modelling performance on h s including si rmse and bias all suggest that the jonswap formula are in general preferred over the collins and madsen formulas e g better scores at dafeng and xiangshui it is found that the differences in r caused by varied formulas of s b o t are within o 10 3 whilst the differences in r with the same formula of s b o t between winter and summer time are greater than o 10 2 analyses on the differences between seasons are shown in section 3 5 the sensitivity of modelling performances due to s b o t is smaller than expected which could be attributed to the limitation in the modeling resolution for example the finest horizontal resolution of the bathymetric source is 1 85 km this implies that the model based on the continental scale cannot resolve the wave physics in the nearshore fully well where s b o t weights for wave propagation process however since the modeling system is targeted at mapping wave climate over the ys where most offshore area is not sensitive to s b o t the default setting with jonswap and c j i o n 0 038 can be applied as a surrogate up to now the modeling calibration has been completed the finalized modelling set up is shown in table 8 in the following contains the calibrated modeling performance over a much longer time period is validated observations from five available wave buoy stations spreading along the shore of the western ys refer to table 2 for the basic information for each station and altimeter data across the ys from the satellites are combined for model validation 3 2 model validation 3 2 1 wave buoy validation good model performance is not only perceived by simple visual inspection fig 8 but also can be justified through thorough statistical analysis shown in table 9 high correlation is achieved between the modelled wave parameters and the observed ones at most of the stations as r exceeds 0 80 for h s and 0 65 for t m probability density distribution for h s reveals more detailed comparisons in wave height component fig 9 it shows in general a good match between the modelled and observed h s except for slight overestimation the overestimation in the modelled h s increases at the north stations e g xiaomaidao xiangshui several reasons could possibly explain the above biases for instance xiaomaidao is located in a semi enclosed embayment where wind fetch is limited and sea state is dominated by local winds the resolution of era5 wind reanalysis cannot resolve the details within the embayment besides wave current effect might be pronounced in the shallow water areas which can affect the intrinsic wave energy distribution last the differences between the swan output and the measurements could also be sourced from the systematic errors within the swan model as well as the measuring system which can also cause biases in wave parameter estimates 3 2 2 satellite validation to offset the blanks of model s performance in the rest of the ys due to site based data validation the altimeter dataset is used for validation over the space without available buoy data particularly for the offshore area the altimeter data for h s sourced from ifremer is aggregated over years since the quality of the altimeter data is highly dependent on their orbit and sensor characteristics thus as described in the section 2 3 2 only the data in association with verifiable level equal to or below 1 is used to facilitate satellite validation wave hindcasts from this study are interpolated every half an hour in time and at the crossings of the tracks for each pair the satellites with their orbits across the ys for visual interpretation fig 10 shows the spatial distribution maps of annual mean si score between the h s from the available altimeter data and the modelled ones and interpolated on 0 5 0 5 grid resolution the blank area in fig 10 contains either no data or data with poor quality the si score equals to 0 indicating a perfect match between the modelled data and the measurement the modeling performance is acceptable with si below 0 4 on most areas of the ys slightly larger si 0 8 1 occurs in a few of cells in the middle of the ys while si 0 6 0 8 happens in one or two cells between the 37 38 n in latitude 3 3 spectrum analysis fig 11 compares the time dependent wave height frequency spectra between the hindcast and the sea surface records at dafeng and xiangshui stations consistently the spectra agree well gaps indicate where the measurements are missing the hindcasted wave spectra well captured the detailed features in the observed wave spectra for example there are consistently four peaks from 02 09 to 02 16 for year 2014 at dafeng of which the high energy concentrates at lower frequencies this signal implies that the waves could possibly reach an equilibrium wind sea states or are composed mainly with swells kukulka et al 2017 phillips 1985 moreover fig 11 reveals distinct differences in the wave spectra between summer and winter at different stations the sea state is much calmer low wave energy density during summer than during winter this is because the summer winds are spreading more evenly across four quarters and not very intensive fig 12 whilst winter winds tend to be much fiercer besides northeast winds prevail in winter while southeast winds dominate in summer at various stations in the coastal region of jiangsu e g typhoon induced winds wind seas induced by the southeast waves accompanied with typhoons are often sheltered by sand ridges such as dongsha shoal across their way to north lastly there are harmonic signals within 24hours in the measured spectra which are apparent at dafeng but not resolved by the wave model e g at xiangshui dafeng this implies the tidal modulation on waves in the shallow waters the failure of the wave model to capture the tidal level induced fluctuations helps to explain the biases in the model validation at the nearshore stations section 3 2 1 3 4 comparison between era5 and era interim in wave hindcast 3 4 1 comparison on wind reanalysis the quality for the wave hindcast is largely dependent on the accuracy of wind forcing fig 13 gives a visual comparison between the wind time series of era5 and observations including s w and the mean wind direction θ m wnd shown in fig 13 the time series of the era5 wind reanalysis data has a good match with the measurement for example the largest r is found at leodo of 0 955 for wind intensity besides wind intensity the simulated wind direction from era5 is also consistent with the observed ones with correlation above 0 8 and bias below 15 exception happens at dafeng but this is because the measured θ m wnd are in 22 5 resolution in order to determine which reanalysis data is more applicable for the study area wind forcing from era5 and era interim are compared at the anemometer stations table 10 it is found almost all the maxima and means of the era5 reanalysis data are close to the observations and are patterned with higher values than the ones of the era interim reanalysis data cavaleri 2010 pointed out that era interim would underestimate peak wind speed results from table 10 imply that era5 not only outperforms era interim in reproducing the extreme wind forcing but also levels up the overall wind intensity it is found except for lengjiasha and xiaomaidao both era5 and era interim led to smaller wind forcing on the western ys shelf the standard deviation represents the fluctuations in s w over a long time period which is small at the nearshore stations and large at the offshore stations e g 4 28 m s at leodo the standard deviations of wind speed of the reanalysis datasets are lower than the ones of the observations e g 2 18 1 98 m s vs 3 01 m s at lvsi which implies that both era5 and era interim might fail to reproduce the extreme winds fig 14 shows the scatter plots probability density distributions and taylor diagrams at dafeng lengjiasha lvsi and lianyuangang with the exception of a few months at xiaomaidao both era5 and era interim show high r and low bias at the anemometer stations for small winds both era5 and era interim perform well however for a few intensive wind events both era5 and era interim reveal negative biases refer to probability density distribution at lvsi and liangyungang this finding supports the inference from table 10 and is consistent with previous studies amarouche et al 2019 lv et al 2014 however it is also found that era5 shows large improvement at lvsi and lianyungang particularly for wind intensity greater than 10 m s the probability density distribution of wind speed from era5 seems also smoother and can better reflect wind conditions at a certain moment era5 also outperforms era interim in three statistical parameters r crmse and rsd for most months especially at stations located in the jiangsu coastal area 3 4 2 comparison on wave reanalysis fig 15 shows the time series comparison between simulated h s driven by the era5 era interim winds and observed h s at three buoy stations dafeng xiangshui and lengjiasha for over one year for a fair comparison the same swan set up is applied for the wave hindcast with parameters set as default it can be seen that the wave field driven by era5 is closer to the observations particularly at peak values shown in table 11 wave hindcast driven by the era5 wind forcing is better than the era interim wind forcing based on larger r smaller rmse smaller si and smaller bias for example at xiangshui r increases from 0 81 to 0 87 for h s and from 0 48 to 0 55 for t m the better performance in wave hindcast can be largely attributed to era5 s finer description of wind field the simulated wave heights driven by both era5 and era interim reanalysis winds are underestimated at dafeng while overestimated at xiangshui and lengjiasha the era5 reanalysis data outperforms era interim at dafeng while era interim performs better at lengjiasha the biases at dafeng and xiangshui are very minimum 0 04 m and 0 05 m for h s respectively however the bias is as large as 0 19 m at lengjiasha from wave hincast by using the era5 wind forcing lengjiasha buoy station is located on a shallow tidal shoal the large bias at which might result from both the coarse bathymetric resolution and the out of consideration of tidal interaction with waves in the model 3 5 sensitivity of bottom friction dissipation on wave directions bottom frictional dissipation weights more as water becomes shallower whilst the rsr contains interlaced shoal channel bathymetry where water depth varies abruptly as bottom dissipation on waves is related to the water depth the wave propagation direction in the rsr matters for calibration on s b o t the western ys experiences strong north winds during winter and south to southeast winds during summer fig 12 the distinct wind directions during the two seasons yield the comparative tests shown in fig 7g and h and the associated wind plumes are shown in fig 16 sensitivity tests are conducted by using jonswap formula for s b o t with varied coefficients c j i o n 0 028 0 038 0 048 and 0 058 modeling performance shows distinct seasonality take lengjiasha as an example for the winter fig 7 g larger k n or larger bottom frictional coefficients c j i o n or c f w results in the better modeling performance for h s however the tendency is opposite for summer fig 7 h during the winter time driven by the north to northeast winds waves directing to lengjiasha should cross the shoals in the northern rsr e g dongsha or maozhusha the interactions between waves and sea bottom are larger than normal on the contrary wind seas coming from south to southeast during summer encounter no obstacles before reaching to lengjiasha thus s b o t is relatively small along the wave s propagation the above analyses suggest that calibration on s b o t is related to wave direction for a region with bathymetry as complex as the rsr note here we consider only the mean wave climate during summer or winter excluding the extremes such as typhoon related events simulation on the extreme events requires downscaled modeling and finer calibration with storm surge model incorporated which is not within the scope of this study and thereby not expanded 4 conclusions a new regional wave hindcast model based on the era5 reanalysis wind datasets for the western shelf of the ys was established topsis was used for determination of the optimal combination from a wide choice of formulas in the swan s source terms janssen 1991 s formula for s i n exponential part combined with janssen 1991 s and alves and banner 2003 s formulas for s w c show consistently better performance than the other choices for s b o t jonswap s hasselmann et al 1973 formula with c j i o n 0 038 works the best the model was validated with observations wave parameters and one dimensional wave spectra from multiple wave buoys located on the inner shelf as well as the satellite altimeter data covering space of the ys wind forcing from era5 shows observable improvement when compared to its previous version the era interim wind forcing for its performance on the wave hindcast in the study domain wave hindcast driven by the era5 reanalysis wind can to some extent offset the underestimation of wave heights forced by the era interim reanalysis wind the improved performance reflects not only on the simulation of extreme events but also on the small wind seas generated by breezes yet it also needs to be noted that at certain nearshore locations there occurs overestimation on wave heights it is also found the modeling performance in the rsr region is quite sensitive to wave directions large frictional coefficient of s b o t is preferred for winter time when wind mainly coming from north while small ones is more appropriate for summer time when wind mainly coming from south the sensitivity of modeling performance due to s b o t is suspected relevant to the propagation directions of wind seas with reference to the directions of the sand ridges credit authorship contribution statement xi

larger for instance siadatmousavi et al 2011 applied k n 200d 50 to the simulation of hurricane dennis in the gulf of mexico yielding a much closer results to the measured values depositive particles

silt and silt rich sand are the most widely distributed sediment types in the western ys shelf accounting for more than 60 of depositive area silt is dominant grain size in study area with an average content of up to 45 and is predominantly found in nearshore areas while sand prevails in places relatively far offshore moreover muddy sediments are rare occurring only off the northern shore of sheyang estuary coarse sand and silt sand are broadly distributed in the northern part of sand ridges such as dongsha and maozhusha while fine particles are deposited in the southern part such as

20360,by using the latest generation atmospheric reanalysis dataset era5 from the european centre for medium range weather forecast a numerical wave simulation system based on swan model for the western shelf of the yellow sea ys is established a thorough calibration is conducted in order to satisfy both modeling accuracy and computational efficiency technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis analysis is used to determine the optimal choice from heterogeneous options of source terms jassens s formulas for wind input and whitecapping and jonswap s formula for bottom frictional dissipation are found most suitable wave parameters and wave spectra from buoy records and satellite observations are combined for model validation results indicate that the era5 reanalysis wind outperforms its early generation era interim for offsetting the underestimated wave heights bias decreases by up to 42 and wave period bias decreases by up to 7 for the inner shelf era5 is found better reproducing the extreme wave simulation whereas could also cause slight overestimation on the shoals for the breeze induced wind seas due to the complex bathymetry of the western inner shelf of the ys calibrated bottom friction coefficients vary for winter and summer which could be relevant to the different directions of the prevailing winds keywords wave simulation era5 era interim yellow sea topsis analysis swan model calibration 1 introduction the fifth generation atmosphere reanalysis dataset era5 from the european centre for mesoscale weather forecasts ecmwf has been recently released from the copernicus climate change service the era5 dataset was established on the assimilation of conventional and satellite observations from the 28 atmospheric assimilation system aas and provides global users with reanalysis of 29 numerical atmospheric forecasts over the earth it embodies a detailed record of the global atmosphere land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards with 29 numerical atmospheric products covering the earth this new dataset is now gradually replacing its predecessor era interim era5 is officially deemed superior to era interim from several aspects 1 model development in physics and core dynamics 2 more available data of assimilation 3 enhanced spatial resolution of 31 km as compared to 80 km and 4 1 hourly output as compared to 6 hourly output of era interim hersbach et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 osinski and radtke 2020 question arises does era5 really performs better than era interim for wind and wave sea hindcast the confidence on the applicability of this newly released database is in urgent needs particularly for regional use the era interim dataset is upgraded from the earlier era 15 and era 40 products by coupling atmospheric oceanic and terrestrial models it uses 4d var assimilation techniques with combination of improved humidity analysis and satellite data error correction techniques to improve the quality of reanalytical data the validity of era interim has been extensively verified by practitioners for instance chen et al 2016 through comparative analysis pointed out that the era interim is in good agreement with the observations from china s coastal stations whilst era5 is supposed to be even better than era interim for its enhanced wind quality rivas and stoffelen 2019 analyzed the differences between the era interim and era5 surface wind fields over a global scale relative to the advanced scatterometer wind observations they concluded that the era5 winds act very similar to the era interim winds except for a 20 improvement in 10 m wind speed on average dullaart et al 2020 suggested that the corresponding strong 10 m winds in tropical cyclones on a global scale shall be greatly improved since the root mean square errors rmses in tropical cyclones wind speeds reduce by 58 in era5 as compared to era interim studies in the artic by graham et al 2019 also confirms the advancing wind fields by era5 out of other era products however most recently the era5 s reliability has been challenged giusti et al 2020 yukiharu 2020 for example soon after the release of the era5 s back extension 1950 1978 giusti et al 2020 pointed out that era5 overestimates the intensity of tropical cyclones and consequently leads a rejection to the observed storm winds however before these reports one may notice that era5 surpasses era interim since it encompasses finer physical expression for tropical cyclones sourced from the international best track archive for climate stewardship knapp et al 2010 which is confirmed in the northwest pacific ocean li and hu 2021 apart from the large biases observed in winds from era5 the overestimation was also observed in waves for instance bruno et al 2020 showed the overestimation by the era5 s reanalysis wave dataset on the swells heights off the southern oman coast in the western arabian sea coincidently in a study of the long term wave climate estimation in the indian ocean naseef and kumar 2020 found consistently large biases based on the era5 reanalysis wave dataset on the contradictory yukiharu 2020 pointed out that era5 would underestimate the significant wave height h s and wave period t for large waves in the coastal area around japan as compared to the buoy measurements they suggested that the accuracy of the era5 wave reanalysis vibrates in fetch unlimited and fetch limited conditions the evident uncertainties aroused from limited existing studies in marginal seas around japan eager corporations on the assessment of the feasibility of era5 in the adjacent seas such as yellow sea ys in the western pacific ocean marginal seas are focused area for coastal and offshore engineering development oceanic carriage and oceanic hazard prediction which are of prominent importance to anthropogenic activities the era5 reanalysis wave dataset generated based on wind fields with 31 km 31 km spatial resolution and output on 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution is too coarse to satisfy the high resolution request for regional studies thus reproduction of wave climate by using the wind reanalysis data with a state of the art wave model is often a necessary the accuracy of the wave hindcast is very vulnerable to atmospheric and oceanic data sources as both of which are subject to the complexity of nearshore lateral and bottom boundary conditions besides the reliability of regional wave simulation also depends on how well the calibration of wave model goes since the physics in oceanic waves are getting complex in the marginal seas many previous wave hindcast studies pointed out that the default setup of a wave model such as simulating waves nearshore swan a third generation wave model developed at delft university of technology often fails to accommodate the validation of model covering their study regimes akpınar et al 2021 bingölbali et al 2019 liang et al 2019 in addition the source terms contributing to the wave genesis are highly sensitive to water depth for the offshore region quadruplet wave interaction and white capping dissipation are more influential while bottom friction dissipation triad wave wave interaction and depth induced breaking are significant in shallow waters such as the western inner shelf yellow sea ys from shandong to the south end of jiangsu coast e g chen et al 2016 chen et al 2016 further showed that whitecapping dissipation s w c and quadruplet wave wave interaction s n l 4 are critical in leading to the seasonal variation of wave climate in most areas of the ys in view of this in case of the same wind forcing is imposed on the wave model without model calibration the reliability of the output can be quite spatially different swan makes input parameters and choices of the empirical functions for physics resolution all flexible for users thus through careful calibration an accurate modelling system targeted at a specific region can be achieved liang et al 2014 however the parametrization of swan has always been a challenge firstly one needs to determine the most important parameters to be adjusted vledder et al 2000 noted that by carefully adjusting s w c deficits in wave simulation caused by s n l 4 can be compensated allahdadi et al 2019 found parameters in the s w c are much more influential than the initial parameters such as directional standard deviation number of spectral frequencies number of iterations time step etc via a detailed calibration work for wave simulation on the continental shelf of the east coast of the united states while in a study focused on the mackenzie delta xu et al 2013 parameters in shallow water dissipation processes such as selections of reasonable breaking index and bottom friction coefficient matter more for developing a rational wave model second even with the primary source term determined there lefts multiple choices of empirical formulas to be parameterized for example akpınar et al 2016 conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the source term parameterization in order to find the optimal expressions for s i n and s w c they showed komen and hasselmann 1984 and janssen 1991 s formulas tend to underestimate the wave period a more pioneering work done by van der westhuysen et al 2007 pointed out the above two formulas could underestimate the low frequency part of the wave energy and hence account for the underprediction of wave period to solve these shortcomings van der westhuysen et al 2007 implemented a modified version of the expression for white capping dissipation based on the work of alves and banner 2003 with careful calibration alves and banner 2003 s method used local saturation in wave spectra instead of averaged spectral parameters the method has been successfully applied to many mixed sea states and often has shown better performances mulligan et al 2008 van der westhuysen et al 2007 however most of these applications were associated with environments of limited wind fetches and short wind durations such as inland lakes semi enclosed bays harbors and other small scale coastal areas allahdadi et al 2018 whether alves and banner 2003 can perform better than komen and hasselmann 1984 along an open coast such as the western inner shelf of ys still waits for further evaluations apart from the complexity in calibrating s i n and s w c there also exists multiple empirical formulas for calculating bottom friction induced wave dissipation s b o t hasselmann et al 1973 collins 1972 madsen et al 1988 however since the seafloor conditions type of submarine material roughness sand ripple s height etc are quite distinct from place to place choices of the formulas for calculating s b o t are quite debating hernández and monbaliu 2001 siadatmousavi et al 2011 besides appropriate coefficients in the selected formula are also spatially dependent this study aims to establish a new wave hindcast system for the western inner shelf of the ys based on the upgraded ecmwf wind reanalysis data meanwhile the following two questions will be discussed a what is an optimal setup for swan model by using the era5 wind reanalysis data for wave hindcast b how well the era5 wind reanalysis data performs on the wave hindcast as compared to its precursor era interim these targets yield the major technical route of this study as shown in fig 1 in the following context section 2 introduces the study domain and the modeling setup section 3 provides detailed calibration and validation processes section 4 discusses the advantages and limitations by using era5 reanalysis wind dataset on regional wave hindcast based on swan model e g location seasonal wind the performance of ear5 and era interim reanalysis wind datasets and their feasibility on wave hindcasts on the ys will be compared the sensitivity of modeling accuracy due to certain physical parameters for wave simulation of typical weathers on the ys will be conducted in the following section 5 concludes the entire study 2 methods and measurements 2 1 study area the western shelf of ys is located in the mid latitude influenced by both northern and southern extreme weathers such as winter storms squall lines and tropical cyclones the entire coastline of the western shelf of the ys spans 954 km long and the coast can be roughly divided into two sections based on the beach types the sandy coast in the north and the silty coast in the south besides the inner shelf incorporates a complex aqueous delta so called the radial sand ridges rsr the rsr is shallow and sits between the sheyang estuary and the northern bank of the yangtze river estuary from 32 00 n to 33 48 n with jianggang as the apex the ridges radiate offshore in a folding fan form the rsr s periphery spans about 200 km and its radius is about 140 km seaward there are more than 70 shoals in this area such as dongsha jiangjiasha and yaosha these shoals vary in size and shape with deep grooves interlaced we adopt an unstructured grid for better describing the bathymetry of the rsr in swan which enables flexible local encryption scheme that can improve the accuracy of wave simulation for this particular area for covering a large scale wave climate the study domain covers the entire ys and the bohai sea spanning 117 e 128 e in longitude and 29 n 41 n in latitude see fig 2 the grid domain of the ys is composed with 33489 triangle cells and 17602 nodes bathymetric data is sourced from two datasets chart data for the jiangsu coastal area which is provided by the navigation guarantee department of the pla navy command and the topex bathymetric data https topex ucsd edu cgi bin get data cgi for the deep ocean out of the scope of the chart data the final bathymetric map presented here covers subtidal intertidal and supertidal areas up to 1 5 m above mean sea level m s l along the jiangsu coast and up to 30 45 m at the cliff dominated coasts around bohai sea and the eastern ys the depth of the deepest water is 154 8 m below the m s l on the offshore boundary the resolution of the chart data is about 3 km and the topex bathymetric resolution is 1 60 1 85 km in both latitude and longitude shoreline shapefile is built upon combined chart data and the digitalized shoreline from google earth in order to better express the shoreline curvature the lowest spatial resolution is set to 27 km on the offshore open boundaries and local encryption is carried out in the jiangsu coastal area with the highest spatial resolution set at 59 m at the apex of the rsr 2 2 swan wave model 2 2 1 model description swan is based on the dynamic spectral balance equation that integrates the effects of wind energy input bottom friction whitecapping dissipation wave breaking and nonlinear impacts the equation consists of the following terms 1 n t c x n x c y n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s σ 2 n e σ where σ represents the relative frequency and θ represents the wave propagation direction n σ θ is wave action spectrum e is wave energy spectrum and s is the total amount of source contributions the first five terms are the gradient of n over time t the gradient of n in geospatial coordinates varies with x and y directions and the gradient of n varies with σ and θ respectively c x c y c σ and c θ represent wave group s propagation velocity in x y σ and θ space respectively the total source term s is composed of whitecapping dissipation s w c bottom friction s b o t wave breaking s b r wave nonlinear interactions s n l 3 and s n l 4 and wind energy input s i n 3 s s w c s b o t s b r s n l 3 s n l 4 s i n the growth of waves s i n due to the action of wind can be described as a process in which the wind energy transforms into the wave field through the air sea interaction the wind input can be expressed as a sum of a linear growth component a phillips 1957 and an exponential growth component b e σ θ miles 1957 formulas are shown in appendix c in the earlier version of swan the expression for a is provided by cavaleri and rizzoli 1981 while the exponential growth term is offered various options komen and hasselmann 1984 yan 1987 and janssen 1991 in the latest version of swan model v41 31 empirical formulas for s i n are further updated apart from the traditional formulas proposed during 1980s 1990s a new formula proposed by rogers et al 2012 is included which can account for the impact from the oblique and counter vailing winds in the new formula rogers et al 2012 wind speed scale local dissipation coefficient and cumulative dissipation coefficient are all adjustable parameters in addition there exists three alternative formulas to adjust wind drag coefficient fan et al 2012 hwang et al 2011 and ecmwf in an earlier study done by amarouche et al 2019 on the wave simulation covering the mediterranean sea the importance of the selection of the wind drag formulas was highlighted in this study varied wind input sources will be tested in order to propose the optimal choice for wave hindcast in the ys with era5 wind reanalysis data the whitecapping term s w c and the bottom dissipation term s b o t are the two most important dissipation terms that can balance s i n there are four options for s w c included in swan v41 31 which are komen and hasselmann 1984 janssen 1991 alves and banner 2003 and babanin et al 2010 and three options for s b o t which are given by collins 1972 madsen et al 1988 and jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 in the following text calibration on s i n s b o t and s w c will be expanded and discussed the formulas for s w c and s b o t are provided in the appendix c 2 2 2 boundary forcing the open boundary of the ys wave model is driven with offshore swell forcing from the assimilated data obtained from the wwiii inversion provided by noaa allahdadi et al 2019 herman et al 2019 phillips 1957 rautenbach et al 2020 the significant wave height h s spectral peak period t p and mean wave direction θ m were imposed on the southeastern open boundary for the open boundary forcing the temporal resolution is 3 h the spatial resolution is of 0 5 the spectral peak factor γ is chosen as 3 3 and were initialized by the jonswap s spectra allahdadi et al 2019 the air sea boundary is driven by the wind forcing from the era5 reanalytical wind speed components u 10 m and v 10 m above the m s l as shown in table 1 the temporal and spatial resolution of era5 and era interim are different modelled regional waves from the two datasets were compared to the measurements in section 4 note for comparisons between the simulations with the two datasets input parameters were set as default for both models the feasibility of wwiii s boundary forcing has been verified in the previous studies in the western inner shelf of ys feng et al 2020 besides the main objective of this paper is to explore the feasibility of the era5 wind data such a procedure requires unilateral testing for example in a recent study beyramzadeh et al 2021 the ear5 reanalysis wave data is not used for boundary forcing in addition to this the feasibility of era5 wave dataset on boundary forcing is limited in the existing studies while the wwiii has been applied extensively bento et al 2018 li et al 2020 wang et al 2018 wu et al 2018 2 3 measured wind and wave data 2 3 1 stations and buoy based observations five wave buoys sitting at xiaomaidao xiangshui dafeng lengjiasha and leodo are used to validate the wave model for the inner shelf fig 2 b wind measurements including wind intensity and wind direction sourced from seven anemometer stations at xiaomaidao lianyungang dafeng lengjiasha lvsi liyashan and leodo are used to check the accuracy of era5 wind reanalysis data table 2 and table 3 conclude the information for the measurements 2 3 2 measurements from satellite altimeter dataset the satellite altimeter data are used for facilitating wave validation in the deep ocean the satellite dataset named as level 2 processing l2p and derived from ifremer globwave ifremer fr are employed in this study the dataset accommodates measurements from multiple satellites and only the data with verifiable values of 0 1 is used the verifiable values are divided into 3 levels in which 0 represents good measurement 1 represents okay for some applications 2 represents bad measurements the information of satellite dataset l2p is shown in table 4 3 numerical results 3 1 model calibration 3 1 1 initial parameters to start the initial parameters including directional standard deviation dsd number of spectral frequencies nf number of iterations nit and time step dt are firstly optimized specifically the model with different parameter inputs dsd nf nit dt is run to find optimal values while keeping the default values for all the other source parameters spectral peak period t p significant wave height h s average wave direction θ m and mean wave period t m are used in the calibration process the model results are compared against measurements at four buoy locations for october 2013 fig 3 the initial model parameters are selected based on the rmses minimization principle it is found that h s t m and t p are all insensitive to dsd the rmses at the three buoy stations are less than o 10 2 m for h s and less than 0 05 s for t m respectively the rmse is relatively larger for t p but mostly within 0 3 s the observed wave direction θ m is more sensitive to the parameter dsd the accuracy the offshore boundary is positively related to dsd however the condition with dsd 90 implies swells may dominate in the western innershelf of ys which does not comply with the reality in this study thus dsd is set as 90 table 5 concludes the initial parameters selected in this study similarly to dsd change in nf has little effect on wave height e g h s and wave period e g t m and t p for example with varied nfs rmses for t p can reach 0 84 s as shown in fig 3b the larger nf is the smaller variability of t p is similar conclusion can be seen for the other parameters although the variability is even smaller thus the upper bound nf 41 is selected for wave modelling the larger nit is taken the more model accuracy might be achieved whereas on the expense of longer computational time in order to find the optimal value for nit sensitive tests are conducted for nit 1 to 5 it is found nit 1 is far from satisfying as the rmses are the largest 0 12 m for h s 1 73 s for t p 0 48 s for t m and 71 83 for θ m respectively as nit increases rmses of the wave parameters decrease during the calibration process after the third iteration the rmses for h s and other wave parameters drop by at least 50 as compared nit 1 the model accuracy is largely increased however since too large a nit can cause too much computational time fig 3 e consequently nit is chosen as 4 to achieve model precision while maintaining the computational efficiency usually smaller dt enables more model stability since the model can better adapt to the changes of bathymetry or wind and wave field with decreased dt the rmses of the four wave parameters gradually decrease fig 3d as the computational time increases exponentially as dt decreases the edge value dt 10 min is selected for wave modelling the final selection of the initial parameters is concluded in table 5 detailed initial parameters calibration can be referred to supplemental information text s1 fig s1 3 1 2 wind energy input and whitecapping dissipation in the ys s w c is predominant among the wave dissipation sources fig 4 the shallow water terms s b o t s n l 3 and s b r are much weaker than s w c besides s i n as the main driver for waves in the ys also needs thorough calibration in the following sensitivity tests the four options for s i n komen and hasselmann 1984 abbreviated as kom and thereafter yan 1987 abbreviated as yan janssen 1991 abbreviated as jan and rogers et al 2012 abbreviated as rog are co evaluated with the options for s w c komen and hasselmann 1984 abbreviated as kom janssen 1991 abbreviated as jan and alves and banner 2003 abbreviated as ab and babanin et al 2010 abbreviated as bab in addition when calculating s i n with rogers et al 2012 three options for calculating wind drag coefficient hwang fan and ecmwf are also tested hwang is the default setting and sourced from hwang et al 2011 fan is from fan et al 2012 ecmwf follows the wam cycle 4 methodology table 6 lists all the combinations considered for s i n and s w c named as s i n s w c e g rogh ab represents s i n calculated by using rog with wind drag coefficient calculated from huang s formula and s w c calculated by using ab due to the massive number of tests technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis hwang and yoon 1981 is used to help with optimal combinations for choices of s i n and s w c topsis analysis ranks the performances of the wave model with heterogeneous combinations of formulas for calculating s i n and s w c based on scores from the comparisons between the swan outputs and the measurements topsis integrates multiple statistics including correlation coefficient r rmse and bias which are normalized for calculating the ranking score all the tests are based on the same time period to exclude weather induced uncertainties wave measurements from year 2013 at dafeng and xiangshui are then used for analysis swan outputs used for the topsis include the nth order of moment of the waves m 0 m 1 m 2 m 4 mean wave period t m significant wave height h s wave steepness stpm and spectral width ε shown in table 6 the model performance with s i n calculated using jan e g jan jan jan ab jan kom always ranks on the top three it turns out that in the ys the updated formulas such as rog for s i n or bab for s w c do not score higher than the traditional options such as jan or kom for both s i n or s w c besides among the three wind drag formulas huang underperforms fan and ecmwf ranking 11 16 vs 4 4 5 7 in this study wind drag coefficient from fan seems more suitable the formulas suggested by van der westhuysen et al 2007 as previously stated fail sometime for the large domain simulation or over long time span it is also noticed by the topsis that scores from jan jan and jan kom were very similar difference less than 10 4 according to allahdadi et al 2019 the two s w c formulas from kom and jan are essentially equivalent in the third mode of swan this is because the dissipation rate in kom s formula for s w c is independent of s t p m while in jan s formula the two parameters are integrated together to generate adjustable parameter c d s 1 shown by the topsis since janssen s formula for s i n jan with default values all lead to satisfying scores slight differences are sourced from varied options of s w c therefore in the following calibration we focus only on the parameterization of jan and ab for s w c the dissipation rate coefficient in s w c c d s 1 for jan and c d s 2 for ab plays an important role in s w c calibration modeling performance with varied dissipation rate coefficients is evaluated c d s 1 in jan is set from 1 5 to 7 5 at an interval of 1 0 and c d s 2 in ab ranges from 2 0e 5 to 8 0e 5 at an interval of 1 0e 5 the modelling performances sourced from varied c d s 1 and c d s 2 are compared through taylor program in the taylor program x axis shows the central root mean square error crmse y axis indicates relative standard deviation rsd and the central angle counted clock wisely from north indicates the correlation coefficient r all with reference to the observations detailed calculation for crmse rsd and r can be referred to the appendix b besides rmse and bias are also calculated in assistance to the parameterization the model performances from varied dissipation rate coefficients for jan or ab of s w c reveal limited differences for both nearshore and offshore stations fig 5 fig 6 in order to sort out the optimal values for the coefficients the elimination method is applied the coefficients causing larger rsd for h s validation are firstly screened out which gives a narrowing range 5 5 c d s 1 2 5 for jan and 4 0e 5 c d s 2 3 0e 5 for ab the offshore stations have better statistic scores than the nearshore stations with varied coefficients at the offshore stations consistently positive biases appear in h s and t p and the jan s formula with c d s 1 4 5 for s w c in general outperforms the results with other parameterizations at nearshore stations there is no clear trend during the calibration of s w c and statistical scores are slightly lower e g r2 0 7 for t m possible reasons could due to that s w c weights more in the deep ocean and the waves are largely influenced by local winds and bathymetry in the nearshore however for the open coast in the ys the nearshore wave climate is predominated by the offshore wave climate thus calibration on s w c is also necessary for the nearshore stations in this case finally jan s formula with c d s 1 3 5 is preferred because of the higher correlations achieved between the simulated and measured wave characteristics at the nearshore stations in addition to c d s 1 δ is the another coefficient in jan for s w c which determines the dependency of the whitecapping on wave number δ is between 0 and 1 with default value as 0 5 according to previous studies allahdadi et al 2019 amarouche et al 2019 siadatmousavi et al 2011 by decreasing δ the model enlarges s w c in the low frequency band and thus leads to smaller t m after testing δ 0 9 of jan is proposed for the model table 7 displays wave statistics for s i n and s w c jan c d s 1 3 5 δ 0 9 after the calibration as compared to the statistics from the default settings in swan s i n and s w c by using kom and default coefficient it is evident the model s performance is elevated after calibration with higher r reduced bias and decreased rmse for instance at lengjiasha station r increases from 0 75 to 0 78 and the bias in h s drops by approximately 0 05 m 3 1 3 bottom friction dissipation calibration in the following step s b o t are calibrated considering three options jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 collins 1972 and madsen madsen et al 1988 fig 7 compares the modelling performances on h s at different stations coefficient in jonswap formulation c j i o n was set to 0 028 0 048 and compared to its default value 0 038 for collins bottom friction coefficient c f w modeling results with c f w 0 015 and c f w 0 020 0 025 are compared the calibrated values of the two parameters are set within the normal ranges the equivalent roughness length scale of the bottom friction k n in madsen et al 1988 is dependent on the local sediment sizes after investigation on the sediments of the seabed along the western coast of ys k n is set to 3 125 mm 6 25 mm and 12 5 mm for calibration detailed investigation and determination on k n can be referred to appendix c the correlation coefficient r is consistently high at all the three stations r 0 85 except for lengjiasha during summer time with different formulas nevertheless the scores of the modelling performance on h s including si rmse and bias all suggest that the jonswap formula are in general preferred over the collins and madsen formulas e g better scores at dafeng and xiangshui it is found that the differences in r caused by varied formulas of s b o t are within o 10 3 whilst the differences in r with the same formula of s b o t between winter and summer time are greater than o 10 2 analyses on the differences between seasons are shown in section 3 5 the sensitivity of modelling performances due to s b o t is smaller than expected which could be attributed to the limitation in the modeling resolution for example the finest horizontal resolution of the bathymetric source is 1 85 km this implies that the model based on the continental scale cannot resolve the wave physics in the nearshore fully well where s b o t weights for wave propagation process however since the modeling system is targeted at mapping wave climate over the ys where most offshore area is not sensitive to s b o t the default setting with jonswap and c j i o n 0 038 can be applied as a surrogate up to now the modeling calibration has been completed the finalized modelling set up is shown in table 8 in the following contains the calibrated modeling performance over a much longer time period is validated observations from five available wave buoy stations spreading along the shore of the western ys refer to table 2 for the basic information for each station and altimeter data across the ys from the satellites are combined for model validation 3 2 model validation 3 2 1 wave buoy validation good model performance is not only perceived by simple visual inspection fig 8 but also can be justified through thorough statistical analysis shown in table 9 high correlation is achieved between the modelled wave parameters and the observed ones at most of the stations as r exceeds 0 80 for h s and 0 65 for t m probability density distribution for h s reveals more detailed comparisons in wave height component fig 9 it shows in general a good match between the modelled and observed h s except for slight overestimation the overestimation in the modelled h s increases at the north stations e g xiaomaidao xiangshui several reasons could possibly explain the above biases for instance xiaomaidao is located in a semi enclosed embayment where wind fetch is limited and sea state is dominated by local winds the resolution of era5 wind reanalysis cannot resolve the details within the embayment besides wave current effect might be pronounced in the shallow water areas which can affect the intrinsic wave energy distribution last the differences between the swan output and the measurements could also be sourced from the systematic errors within the swan model as well as the measuring system which can also cause biases in wave parameter estimates 3 2 2 satellite validation to offset the blanks of model s performance in the rest of the ys due to site based data validation the altimeter dataset is used for validation over the space without available buoy data particularly for the offshore area the altimeter data for h s sourced from ifremer is aggregated over years since the quality of the altimeter data is highly dependent on their orbit and sensor characteristics thus as described in the section 2 3 2 only the data in association with verifiable level equal to or below 1 is used to facilitate satellite validation wave hindcasts from this study are interpolated every half an hour in time and at the crossings of the tracks for each pair the satellites with their orbits across the ys for visual interpretation fig 10 shows the spatial distribution maps of annual mean si score between the h s from the available altimeter data and the modelled ones and interpolated on 0 5 0 5 grid resolution the blank area in fig 10 contains either no data or data with poor quality the si score equals to 0 indicating a perfect match between the modelled data and the measurement the modeling performance is acceptable with si below 0 4 on most areas of the ys slightly larger si 0 8 1 occurs in a few of cells in the middle of the ys while si 0 6 0 8 happens in one or two cells between the 37 38 n in latitude 3 3 spectrum analysis fig 11 compares the time dependent wave height frequency spectra between the hindcast and the sea surface records at dafeng and xiangshui stations consistently the spectra agree well gaps indicate where the measurements are missing the hindcasted wave spectra well captured the detailed features in the observed wave spectra for example there are consistently four peaks from 02 09 to 02 16 for year 2014 at dafeng of which the high energy concentrates at lower frequencies this signal implies that the waves could possibly reach an equilibrium wind sea states or are composed mainly with swells kukulka et al 2017 phillips 1985 moreover fig 11 reveals distinct differences in the wave spectra between summer and winter at different stations the sea state is much calmer low wave energy density during summer than during winter this is because the summer winds are spreading more evenly across four quarters and not very intensive fig 12 whilst winter winds tend to be much fiercer besides northeast winds prevail in winter while southeast winds dominate in summer at various stations in the coastal region of jiangsu e g typhoon induced winds wind seas induced by the southeast waves accompanied with typhoons are often sheltered by sand ridges such as dongsha shoal across their way to north lastly there are harmonic signals within 24hours in the measured spectra which are apparent at dafeng but not resolved by the wave model e g at xiangshui dafeng this implies the tidal modulation on waves in the shallow waters the failure of the wave model to capture the tidal level induced fluctuations helps to explain the biases in the model validation at the nearshore stations section 3 2 1 3 4 comparison between era5 and era interim in wave hindcast 3 4 1 comparison on wind reanalysis the quality for the wave hindcast is largely dependent on the accuracy of wind forcing fig 13 gives a visual comparison between the wind time series of era5 and observations including s w and the mean wind direction θ m wnd shown in fig 13 the time series of the era5 wind reanalysis data has a good match with the measurement for example the largest r is found at leodo of 0 955 for wind intensity besides wind intensity the simulated wind direction from era5 is also consistent with the observed ones with correlation above 0 8 and bias below 15 exception happens at dafeng but this is because the measured θ m wnd are in 22 5 resolution in order to determine which reanalysis data is more applicable for the study area wind forcing from era5 and era interim are compared at the anemometer stations table 10 it is found almost all the maxima and means of the era5 reanalysis data are close to the observations and are patterned with higher values than the ones of the era interim reanalysis data cavaleri 2010 pointed out that era interim would underestimate peak wind speed results from table 10 imply that era5 not only outperforms era interim in reproducing the extreme wind forcing but also levels up the overall wind intensity it is found except for lengjiasha and xiaomaidao both era5 and era interim led to smaller wind forcing on the western ys shelf the standard deviation represents the fluctuations in s w over a long time period which is small at the nearshore stations and large at the offshore stations e g 4 28 m s at leodo the standard deviations of wind speed of the reanalysis datasets are lower than the ones of the observations e g 2 18 1 98 m s vs 3 01 m s at lvsi which implies that both era5 and era interim might fail to reproduce the extreme winds fig 14 shows the scatter plots probability density distributions and taylor diagrams at dafeng lengjiasha lvsi and lianyuangang with the exception of a few months at xiaomaidao both era5 and era interim show high r and low bias at the anemometer stations for small winds both era5 and era interim perform well however for a few intensive wind events both era5 and era interim reveal negative biases refer to probability density distribution at lvsi and liangyungang this finding supports the inference from table 10 and is consistent with previous studies amarouche et al 2019 lv et al 2014 however it is also found that era5 shows large improvement at lvsi and lianyungang particularly for wind intensity greater than 10 m s the probability density distribution of wind speed from era5 seems also smoother and can better reflect wind conditions at a certain moment era5 also outperforms era interim in three statistical parameters r crmse and rsd for most months especially at stations located in the jiangsu coastal area 3 4 2 comparison on wave reanalysis fig 15 shows the time series comparison between simulated h s driven by the era5 era interim winds and observed h s at three buoy stations dafeng xiangshui and lengjiasha for over one year for a fair comparison the same swan set up is applied for the wave hindcast with parameters set as default it can be seen that the wave field driven by era5 is closer to the observations particularly at peak values shown in table 11 wave hindcast driven by the era5 wind forcing is better than the era interim wind forcing based on larger r smaller rmse smaller si and smaller bias for example at xiangshui r increases from 0 81 to 0 87 for h s and from 0 48 to 0 55 for t m the better performance in wave hindcast can be largely attributed to era5 s finer description of wind field the simulated wave heights driven by both era5 and era interim reanalysis winds are underestimated at dafeng while overestimated at xiangshui and lengjiasha the era5 reanalysis data outperforms era interim at dafeng while era interim performs better at lengjiasha the biases at dafeng and xiangshui are very minimum 0 04 m and 0 05 m for h s respectively however the bias is as large as 0 19 m at lengjiasha from wave hincast by using the era5 wind forcing lengjiasha buoy station is located on a shallow tidal shoal the large bias at which might result from both the coarse bathymetric resolution and the out of consideration of tidal interaction with waves in the model 3 5 sensitivity of bottom friction dissipation on wave directions bottom frictional dissipation weights more as water becomes shallower whilst the rsr contains interlaced shoal channel bathymetry where water depth varies abruptly as bottom dissipation on waves is related to the water depth the wave propagation direction in the rsr matters for calibration on s b o t the western ys experiences strong north winds during winter and south to southeast winds during summer fig 12 the distinct wind directions during the two seasons yield the comparative tests shown in fig 7g and h and the associated wind plumes are shown in fig 16 sensitivity tests are conducted by using jonswap formula for s b o t with varied coefficients c j i o n 0 028 0 038 0 048 and 0 058 modeling performance shows distinct seasonality take lengjiasha as an example for the winter fig 7 g larger k n or larger bottom frictional coefficients c j i o n or c f w results in the better modeling performance for h s however the tendency is opposite for summer fig 7 h during the winter time driven by the north to northeast winds waves directing to lengjiasha should cross the shoals in the northern rsr e g dongsha or maozhusha the interactions between waves and sea bottom are larger than normal on the contrary wind seas coming from south to southeast during summer encounter no obstacles before reaching to lengjiasha thus s b o t is relatively small along the wave s propagation the above analyses suggest that calibration on s b o t is related to wave direction for a region with bathymetry as complex as the rsr note here we consider only the mean wave climate during summer or winter excluding the extremes such as typhoon related events simulation on the extreme events requires downscaled modeling and finer calibration with storm surge model incorporated which is not within the scope of this study and thereby not expanded 4 conclusions a new regional wave hindcast model based on the era5 reanalysis wind datasets for the western shelf of the ys was established topsis was used for determination of the optimal combination from a wide choice of formulas in the swan s source terms janssen 1991 s formula for s i n exponential part combined with janssen 1991 s and alves and banner 2003 s formulas for s w c show consistently better performance than the other choices for s b o t jonswap s hasselmann et al 1973 formula with c j i o n 0 038 works the best the model was validated with observations wave parameters and one dimensional wave spectra from multiple wave buoys located on the inner shelf as well as the satellite altimeter data covering space of the ys wind forcing from era5 shows observable improvement when compared to its previous version the era interim wind forcing for its performance on the wave hindcast in the study domain wave hindcast driven by the era5 reanalysis wind can to some extent offset the underestimation of wave heights forced by the era interim reanalysis wind the improved performance reflects not only on the simulation of extreme events but also on the small wind seas generated by breezes yet it also needs to be noted that at certain nearshore locations there occurs overestimation on wave heights it is also found the modeling performance in the rsr region is quite sensitive to wave directions large frictional coefficient of s b o t is preferred for winter time when wind mainly coming from north while small ones is more appropriate for summer time when wind mainly coming from south the sensitivity of modeling performance due to s b o t is suspected relevant to the propagation directions of wind seas with reference to the directions of the sand ridges credit authorship contribution statement xi

silt and silt rich sand are the most widely distributed sediment types in the western ys shelf accounting for more than 60 of depositive area silt is dominant grain size in study area with an average content of up to 45 and is predominantly found in nearshore areas while sand prevails in places relatively far offshore moreover muddy sediments are rare occurring only off the northern shore of sheyang estuary coarse sand and silt sand are broadly distributed in the northern part of sand ridges such as dongsha and maozhusha while fine particles are deposited in the southern part such as

20361,the dynamic response of a two rotor wind turbine mounted on a spar type floating platform is studied the response is compared against the baseline oc3 single rotor design structural design shows how the two rotor design may lead to a mass saving of about 26 with respect to an equivalent single rotor configuration simulations predict significant platform yaw response of the two rotor floating wind turbine about 6 deg standard deviation at the rated operating wind speed it is shown how the platform yaw response is directly caused by the turbulence intensity at the hub coupled with the transversal distribution of thrust loads on the structure a coupled control strategy for the rotor collective blade pitch controller is proposed in which a simple proportional control mitigating platform yaw motion is superimposed to the baseline oc3 pi controller numerical simulations show how platform yaw response is reduced by about 60 at the cost of mean power loss at below rated wind speeds of about 100 kw and maximum increase of the rotor collective blade pitch angles standard deviation of about 2 deg parametric analysis of mooring lines design shows how an equivalent mass density of the line of at least 190 kg m is needed to avoid vertical loads at the anchors keywords floating offshore wind turbines dynamic analysis multi rotor wind turbines spar buoy platform modelica 1 introduction offshore wind energy is a steadily growing industry reaching in 2019 a total worldwide offshore wind power capacity of 30 gw out of a total worldwide wind power capacity of 600 gw gwec 2019 offshore wind energy is appealing since wind speed is much greater offshore than inland and since many of the drawbacks of wind turbine deployment derives from interaction with populated areas cruz and atcheson 2016 ideal wind energy sites are mostly locations where water depth far exceeds 50 m while bottom fixed offshore wind turbines are economically feasible to be deployed only in shallow water depths jonkman 2007 floating wind turbines fowts able to be deployed in deep waters offer a technological solution and may thus help in the reduction of the overall levelized cost of energy lcoe associated with wind energy reduction of the overall lcoe may in principle be achieved also by means of downscaling wind turbines into equivalent multi rotor systems two or more wind turbines installed on the same structure the development of multi rotor wind turbines is an old idea first developed early in the 20th century when the lack of advanced glass fiber composite materials made the manufacturing of large rotors unfeasible jamieson and branney 2012 the rated power of a wind turbine is proportional to the net area swept by the rotor blades it thus scales with the square of the rotor radius however the blade mass generally increases with the cube of the rotor radius thus making an array of smaller turbine units advantageous jamieson and branney 2012 multi rotor wind turbine concepts are also interesting from an economical and logistical perspective since small blades are easier to manufacture transport and deploy with respect to state of the art blade sizes

bastankhah and abkar 2019 also performed a large eddy simulation to study the wake flow properties of a similar four rotor concept they found out that the wake recovery is faster at short downwind distances with respect to a single rotor system the eu funded project innwind jamieson et al 2015 proposed a 20 mw configuration composed of 45 turbines 444 kw each conclusions claimed a reduction of the lcoe against an equivalent single rotor configuration of about 15 kirchner bossi and porté agel 2020 showed that the optimization of the layout of multi rotor wind farms may lead to significant benefits also in terms of overall power density compared to a baseline single rotor wind farm layout research of multi rotor concepts mounted on floating platforms is to date scant first concepts date back to the time of the earliest works in the field such as the work of heronemus 1972 multiple unit floating offshore windfarm mufow barltrop 1993 was a uk based project started in 1993 aiming at the investigation of the feasibility of arrays of wind turbines mounted on a single floating platform however the idea has yet to be studied thoroughly and its feasibility has yet to be analyzed in detail the overall dynamic response of the floating system must be carefully studied as well as the aerodynamic interaction of the rotors under operative and extreme environmental conditions in this work the dynamic response of a two rotor wind turbine mounted on a spar floating platform is studied the study relies upon a reduced aerodynamic model simplified yet adequate to get the overall dynamic characteristics of the multi rotor fowt concept the advantageous stability and relatively simple design and manufacturing of spar type platforms made it one of the most studied designs over the years and the abundance of reference designs makes it suitable to be used in conceptual analyses phase iv oc3 for instance is widely used as a major reference design jonkman 2010 2009a full scale deployment of floating wind turbines also utilized spar type design as in hywind demo equinor 2020a the first full scale prototype of a fowt deployed in norway in 2009 as well as in hywind scotland equinor 2020b the first floating wind farm situated in scotland and commissioned in 2017 the analysis of this work relies on an in house tool for the simplified fully coupled analysis of fowts concepts the predictive tool is developed in modelica a non proprietary declarative object oriented language developed by the non profit modelica association and employed to conveniently model multi domain systems the modelica association 2020 the multi rotor fowt system is modeled as a rigid body a dummy degree of freedom dof describing the simplified rigid rotor dynamics is added to the system equations of motion eqm in order to determine the aerodynamic state of the system the aerodynamic loads are then modeled as concentrated thrusts acting on the rotor hubs and as concentrated torques acting on the rotor low speed shafts the aerodynamic loads are computed by considering the relative velocity between the hub and wind transversal to the rotor plane and mapping the steady state aerodynamic coefficients of the wind turbine this method is thought of as a simplified alternative to more complex beam element momentum bem models and previous work el beshbichi et al 2021 showed how results obtained are accurate in terms of overall dynamic response in operative environmental conditions the method however presents major limitations when considering more complex dynamic interactions the rotors flexibility and dynamic contributions to the overall system dynamics are neglected the aerodynamic interaction between rotors as well as the aerodynamic effects induced by skewed flows are also not considered the present work is structured as follows first the two rotor wind turbine concept 2wt is presented a simple structural study is carried out in order to define first attempt tower dimensions and inertial properties moreover the spar platform design is carried out by setting forth general hydrostatic performance considerations next the dynamic response of the 2wt system is analyzed and contrasted with the response of the reference oc3 floating wind turbine the response of the 2wt system is analyzed by means of two different rotor collective blade pitch control strategies the baseline oc3 controller and a coupled controller that incorporates mitigation of yaw response finally remarks about mooring lines dimensioning applied to the 2wt system are given 2 multi rotor wind turbine concept fig 1 shows the multi rotor wind turbine concept defined in the present work in relation to the standard oc3 design jonkman 2007 2010 the concept is composed of a two rotor wind turbine mounted on a spar buoy floating platform as in any new technology development the multi rotor fwt will eventually converge to the most optimal concept this means that the oc3 spar design might not be the most optimal concept for the multi rotor wt however the oc3 spar design has been studied extensively by a large number of researchers over the last decade using this concept in the present paper offers the advantage of greatly aiding result assessment the hub height from the sea water level swl is about 90 m while the horizontal distance between the hubs is about 138 6 m the center of gravity cog of the oc3 system is about 78 m from the swl while it is about 100 9 m for the 2wt system standard nrel 5 mw wind turbines are used in this study whose main specifications are listed in table 1 the horizontal rotor spacing is assumed to be 10 of the rotor diameter inspired by the multi rotor turbine concept installed at dtu risø by vestas a s bastankhah and abkar 2019 the 2wt tower is composed of a main vertical tapered cylinder a secondary vertical cylinder mounted on top of it and two horizontal tapered cylindrical arms supporting the rotor nacelle assemblies rnas wires are used to connect the end of the horizontal arms to the top of the vertical structure the inclination angle of the wires is 30 deg this structural geometry allows for distribution of the aerodynamic loads on the horizontal arms as bending loads while the wires distribute the static loads given by the arms self weight and rnas concentrated weight at the hubs as compression loads on the main structure the assessment of local buckling resistance is neglected at this stage in the context of the present work a simple structural dimensioning of the tower is carried out with the aim of defining first attempt global inertia properties of the fowt system the following study is thus simplified and not intended to focus on detailed structural design table 2 shows the parameters used for the simplified structural design while table 3 summarizes the selected tower geometry in terms of cross sectional dimensions of each tower sub domain data are given in terms of inner diameter outer diameter and related thickness and are given both at the base and top of the sub structure intermediate cross sections are defined through linear tapering the structural computation assumes the maximum aerodynamic thrust acting at the hub i e 808kn for the nrel 5 mw wind turbine jonkman 2007 the wire tension and the reaction forces acting at the horizontal arms base are readily computed by solving the associated statically indeterminate beam problem the loaded cross section area must be big enough to prevent yield s y i e l d yield assessment is performed at the most stressed sections of the structure i e at the tower base and at the horizontal arm base a safety factor γ of 1 4 is used to obtain a conservative design the yield assessment can be prescribed as follows 1 4 r o u t m π r o u t 4 r i n 4 s y i e l d γ where m is the bending load acting at the base of the tower sub domain and r o u t and r i n are the outer and inner radii at the base cross section respectively maximum and minimum values of thickness are considered equal to 0 04 m and 0 001 m respectively the bending moment acting at the base of the horizontal arms is assumed given by the action of the aerodynamic thrust the rna weight concentrated at the hub and the horizontal arm self weight on the other hand the bending moment acting at the base of the vertical tower is assumed chiefly related to the action of the aerodynamic thrusts effective loads as well as the ratio between effective and yield stress are listed in table 3 the bending stress obtained is equivalent to about 94 mpa at the horizontal arms base and about 135 mpa at the vertical tower base following an utilization ratio close to 50 the total concentrated mass of the tower thus defined is about 536 9 tonnes the wire dimensioning is carried out in accordance with the recommended guidelines of the standard en1993 1 11 based on en 1990 eurocode 3 2006 the wire cross section must be big enough to prevent yield under maximum external load a value of γ equal to 1 4 is used also in this case the wire diameter can be estimated as follows eurocode 3 2006 2 d w i r e 4 t γ π f k r r where t is the wire tension r r is the wire grade f is the wire fill factor and k is the spinning loss factor the obtained wire tension is about 7730kn while the obtained wire diameter is about 107 mm the wire concentrated mass is about 4 94 tonnes 3 platform design criteria the dimensioning process of a floating platform is mainly driven by 1 the maximization of pitch stiffness in order to reduce maximum static pitch angle 2 the maximization of natural heave period in order to reduce wave induced motion and 3 the reduction of the overall cost chiefly driven by the platform mass and dimensions cruz and atcheson 2016 fatigue criteria are also applied in later design stages but may be neglected in conceptual design the design space of a spar buoy platform is generally composed of the platform draft the upper diameter d 1 and the lower diameter d 2 as major design parameters platform design parameters associated to the final system geometry adopted in this work are those depicted in fig 1 the distance between the swl and the top of the platform is equal to the value used in the standard oc3 design that is 10 m the distance between swl and the top of the lower spar section is also equal to the standard oc3 value 12 m spar thickness is assumed constant and equal to 0 05 m the platform design is carried out in terms of hydrostatic performance and simple computations can at this stage be employed in order to obtain useful predictions the following sections present a brief discussion of the common criteria used in platform design 3 1 hydrostatic considerations the major criteria used in platform design can be described as follows 1 the floating platform must achieve hydrostatic equilibrium in order to enforce the constraint the mass of the spar buoy ballast is imposed by means of the following hydrostatic vertical equilibrium 3 m b a l l a s t ρ w a t e r v w g 3 f m v m s g m t n r g g where ρ w a t e r is the water density v w is the water displaced volume g is the acceleration due to gravity f m v is the total vertical mooring line static load m s is the spar buoy mass and m t n r is the mass of tower nacelles and rotors in the design process the ballast center of gravity is assumed to be located at 5 m from the bottom of the spar buoy platform f m v is assumed equal to the vertical mooring line static load of the oc3 standard design 2 the maximum static pitch angle must be sufficiently small in order to avoid an excessive pitch dynamic response and to limit the loss of annual energy production aep due to the skewed flow conditions cruz and atcheson 2016 according to zambrano et al 2006 the maximum static pitch angle must not exceed 5 deg with 15 deg of dynamic amplitude the static pitch angle can be estimated as follows pham and shin 2019 4 θ 5 f t h r u s t h b c 55 where θ 5 is the static pitch angle f t h r u s t is the overall thrust force acting at the hubs h b is the vertical distance from the hubs to the center of buoyancy cob of the spar buoy platform and c 55 is the hydrostatic restoring pitch stiffness which can be derived from metacentric height relationships faltinsen 1993 3 the pitch and heave natural periods must be larger than 25 30 s in order to avoid resonance motions with first order wave effects bachynski and moan 2012 the heave period is estimated as follows 5 t 33 2 π m t o t a 33 ρ w a t e r g a w where m t o t is the overall fowt mass a 33 is the added mass component in heave direction and a w is the waterplane area the value used to estimate a 33 is assumed in the design stage constant and equal to the value associated with the standard oc3 platform jonkman 2010 the pitch period is estimated by considering surge pitch coupling the estimation is carried out by solving the associated surge pitch characteristic equation 6 ω 2 m t o t z c o g m t o t z c o g m t o t i 55 a 11 a 15 a 51 a 55 0 0 0 c 55 c m 11 c m 15 c m 51 c m 55 ϕ 0 where ω and ϕ are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system z c o g is the vertical location of the overall center of gravity of the fowt system i 55 is the overall pitch inertia a 11 a 15 a 51 and a 55 are respectively the added mass in surge surge pitch pitch surge and pitch directions and c m 11 c m 15 c m 51 and c m 55 are respectively the mooring linear stiffness values in surge surge pitch pitch surge and pitch directions the pitch period is simply computed as 7 t 55 2 π ω 5 where ω 5 is the eigenvalue associated with the pitch direction the values used to estimate the added mass and mooring lines linear stiffness are assumed in the design stage constant and equal to the value associated with the standard oc3 platform jonkman 2010 the mooring lines stiffness is relative to an unstretched length of 902 2 m a mass density of 77 71 kg m a vertical static length of 250 m and a diameter of 0 09 m the platform draft affects the vertical static length of the mooring lines and consequently the mooring lines stiffness hence a difference is to be expected between the dynamic response of the system and the hydrostatic results the difference is assumed to be small in pitch and heave directions and therefore tolerable in a preliminary design context 3 1 1 periods fig 2 shows the variation of heave and pitch periods of the 2wt system as a function of the draft lower diameter d 2 and higher diameter d 1 within 100 m draft 170 m 10 m d 2 12 m and d 1 either equal to 7 5 m left hand side plots or equal to 10 m right hand side plots the red dot denotes the final spar design configuration selected in the present work as shown the pitch period tends to increase in configurations with shorter draft and d 2 lengths while it does not vary substantially with variations of d 1 values obtained indicate that only for unrealistic configurations given by extremely long draft and d 2 the pitch period becomes unacceptably short the heave period tends to increase in configurations with longer draft and d 2 lengths and reduces substantially in configurations with longer d 1 lengths note that in the case of d 1 10 m the heave period reduces to values close to 25 s for feasible values of draft and d 2 also for this reason longer d 1 lengths should be avoided 3 1 2 maximum static pitch angle fig 3 shows the maximum static pitch angle of the 2wt system as a function of platform design parameters within the same value range used in fig 2 as it is clear a greater maximum static pitch angle is obtained for shorter lengths of draft and d 2 longer lengths of d 1 reduce to a minor extent the static pitch angle the isoline relative to 4 5 deg should be considered as a threshold for acceptable platform configurations note that the maximum static pitch angle is the most stringent constraint in the design of multi rotor floating wind turbines given that it eliminates most of the design space 3 1 3 mass sensitivity fig 4 shows the overall spar buoy mass including ballast as a function of platform design parameters within the same value range used in fig 2 the spar mass should always be minimized in order to reduce the construction material and deployment cost 3 2 platform configuration the selection process of a feasible platform configuration is based on a trade off among the design constraints previously mentioned the main design objective is to achieve acceptable hydrostatic performance and to minimize the platform mass to be employed drafts longer than 140 m are unfeasible to deploy and are susceptible to fatigue loading while higher d 2 lengths generally lead to excessive manufacturing and deployment costs cruz and atcheson 2016 from design considerations several conclusions can be drawn for a multi rotor fowt employing multi mw wind turbines such as the 2wt concept considered in the present study heave and pitch periods are generally not a stringent constraint within the region of feasible designs in view of the greater inertia involved for draft lengths shorter than 130 140 m the maximum static pitch angle exceeds the limit imposed of 5 deg this constraint is the most stringent of the design process higher d 1 lengths are slightly beneficial in terms of maximum static pitch angle but significantly reduce the heave period and increase the platform mass of about 500 tonnes in the present work the platform configuration selected is characterized by a draft of 140 m d 1 7 5 m and d 2 10 5 m table 4 summarizes the geometrical the inertial and the hydrostatic specifications of the configuration selected together with the specifications of the baseline oc3 spar buoy platform the fairlead depth from swl is assumed to be equally distanced from the cog and the cob as in the case of the baseline oc3 design the fairleads depth from swl is thus equal to 86 5 m the ratio between the fairlead radius and d 2 is set equal to the one used in the baseline oc3 design the fairlead radius from the centerline is thus equal to 5 78 m the overall concentrated mass of the 2wt system is about 11 8 1 0 3 tonnes the moments of inertia are computed by employing a cad model of the fowt system the rna mass is assumed to be concentrated at the hub the associated inertia tensor of the 2wt system computed at the cog can be written as follows 8 i 2 w t 6 13 1 0 10 5 93 10 5 1 67 10 7 5 93 10 5 5 77 10 10 1 47 10 5 1 67 10 7 1 47 10 5 3 69 10 9 kgm 2 table 5 shows the relative variation of mass between two standard oc3 wind turbine units and an equivalent 2wt concept even without performing structural optimization the present 2wt design brings about a significant mass saving of about 26 3 with respect to an equivalent single rotor configuration equivalently the rated power to weight ratio associated to the 2wt concept is about 0 85 w kg in place of 0 61 w kg of the oc3 hywind design however the power to weight ratio does not consider the overall power performance of the system but assumes rated power for each rotor as independent systems the aerodynamic performance of the 2wt design must be carefully studied by considering all the major aerodynamic effects and interactions before an accurate statement on power performance can be drawn 4 fully coupled dynamic analysis in this work the coupled dynamic behavior of the 2wt concept is studied by employing an in house code implemented by means of the object oriented language modelica the approach allows for easy implementation of arbitrary platform geometries and platform rotor configurations previous benchmarking work el beshbichi et al 2021 based on the international energy agency iea code to code comparisons for the baseline oc3 design jonkman et al 2010 has also shown how this method gives good agreement to well established dynamic codes in situations where rotor dynamic contribution can be neglected the system is assumed to be rigid the hydrodynamic added damping values employed are assumed equal to those associated with the baseline oc3 design albeit yaw mooring stiffness is associated with the mooring lines design in this work its value is assumed constant and equal to the one characterizing the baseline oc3 design the rotor inertial effects including the contribution of gyroscopic effects on the system dynamics are not considered 4 1 environmental conditions three specific load cases lcs are considered in this work each case is characterized by directionally congruent turbulent wind and irregular waves based on standard jonswap spectra table 6 summarizes the characteristics of the lcs selected the cases considered are relative to different environmental severity regions the first case lc1 is relative to a below rated operational wind speed the second case lc2 is relative to the rated operational wind speed and the last case lc3 is relative to above rated operational wind speed wave energy content increases accordingly the turbulence intensity at the hub follows the kaimal spectrum with iec class b normal turbulence model ntm based on the standard iec 61400 1 iec 2005 4 2 hydrodynamic modeling the hydrodynamic loads are computed from linear airy wave theory airy theory can be applied if the water depth is sufficiently deep dnv gl 2010 the numerical panel code sesam wadam dnv gl dnv gl 2020 is used to solve the frequency domain linear hydrodynamic problem relative to the selected platform geometry time realizations of irregular wave loads are preventively computed by means of inverse fourier transformations ift the additional load contribution associated with hydrodynamic viscous drag is not considered in this work c d 0 however it should be noted that viscous drag loads may be significant in extreme environmental situations where much larger waves and current effects are considered zheng et al 2020 4 3 mooring lines modeling mooring lines design is assumed in this work equal to the standard oc3 design that is three catenary mooring lines mounted at 120 deg from one another jonkman 2010 fig 5 shows a top view schematization of the standard mooring system employed in the 2wt spar buoy platform based on the oc3 design h f 1 2 3 are the horizontal mooring loads acting at the fairleads even though the delta catenary mooring lines used in the oc3 hywind platform are not subject to significant yaw moments their designs allow for yaw stiffness which may be easily increased by increasing the fairlead length a quasi static formulation of the mooring lines loads is employed in order to obtain the loads displacements relationship at the fairleads jonkman 2007 the effect of the mooring lines design on the yaw stiffness is neglected and a constant equivalent yaw stiffness of 9 8 10 7 nm rad is used throughout the results to account for the effect of the delta lines moreover the oc3 hywind load displacement relationship in the platform s yaw direction is found to be linear at least up to a platform s yaw angle of about 20 deg jonkman 2010 a linear stiffness relationship can then be used also where the platform s yaw motion is considered significant the mooring lines mass density used is set in this work equal to 200 kg m 4 4 aerodynamic modeling in this work the aerodynamic loads are computed by mapping the steady state thrust and torque aerodynamic coefficients of each rotor this approach is different to standard codes where a full bem method is employed and to simplified codes where the aerodynamic thrust is simply computed as function of the wind speed karimirad and moan 2012 integrated loads are used and hence the distribution of the local aerodynamic loads and the associated local moments on the blades is neglected karimirad and moan 2012 a simplified rigid rotor eqm is considered to emulate the rotors aerodynamic response aerodynamic concentrated thrusts are applied at the hubs while aerodynamic concentrated torques are applied at the equivalent low speed rotor shafts the relative velocity between hub and wind speed transversal to the rotor plane is used the thrust loads are computed as el beshbichi et al 2021 9 f 1 2 ρ a i r c t λ β a u r e l 2 where ρ a i r is the air density c t is the steady state thrust coefficient λ is the tip speed ratio β is the rotor collective blade pitch angle a is the rotor plane area and u r e l is the relative speed between local wind and hub the torque loads are computed as 10 t 1 2 ρ a i r r c q λ β a u r e l 2 where r is the rotor radius and c q is the steady state torque coefficient the three dimensional wind velocity profiles at the hubs are computed in jonkman 2009b and imported in the code a 15x15 grid is used wide enough to encompass the rotors space and a time step of 0 05 s is used to generate the wind profiles wind time histories of 4000 s are computed for each environmental condition this method although generating accurate overall dynamic predictions in operational environmental conditions is not able to detect more complex aerodynamic effects for instance the wind profile time realizations used for the computation of the concentrated aerodynamic loads are associated only with the hub locations this assumption neglects the spatial turbulence variation on the rotors swept area the effect of the horizontal arms on the local wind induction factors is also not considered moreover skewed blade aerodynamics is not considered as well as the aerodynamic interaction between the rotors albeit literature on similar multi rotor fowts is scant research works in different fields concerning similar applications such as the study of thrust deficit induced by the aerodynamic interaction among rotors of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs zhou et al 2017 alvarez and ning 2017 suggest that the effect of the rotor aerodynamic interaction on the overall system response may not be significant enough to compromise the general dynamic behavior obtained in the present study at any rate the significance of these effects on multi rotor fowt system dynamics can be quantified by employing corrected bem aerodynamic capabilities in modelica which is a task currently under development the tower base local reference frame is assumed placed at the same inertial location for all configurations fig 6 shows the wind profiles relative to the same realization and attributed to the hub locations for the oc3 wind turbine the 2wt left wind turbine 2wtl and the 2wt right wind turbine 2wtr the time histories are relative to a mean wind speed of 8 m s lc1 4 5 control modeling as it will be presented in detail in section 5 4 the platform yaw motion response of the 2wt is particularly critical for this reason the quantification of the feasibility of mitigating the platform yaw motion by means of an optimized rotor collective blade pitch control strategy is proposed the pitch actuator dynamics is assumed fast enough to be neglected for rigid dynamics analysis that is there is no delay between the reference pitch angle and the actual pitch angle a second order low pass filter can generally be used to represent pitch actuator dynamics common values for cut off frequency and damping ratio are about 1 hz and 0 7 respectively fast compared to the system dynamics dunne and pao 2016 two rotor collective blade pitch control strategies are separately applied to the 2wt concept the controls employed are the following oc3 baseline control the standard oc3 pi rotor collective blade pitch control on the generator speed as described in jonkman 2007 is used to independently control both rotors coupled control the baseline oc3 baseline pi rotor collective blade pitch control on the generator speed is linearly coupled with a proportional rotor collective blade pitch control on the 2wt platform yaw motion the coupled control strategy proposed is designed to induce a reduction of aerodynamic thrust at the hub whose surge motion brought about by the yaw dynamics is positive the rotor collective blade pitch angle β i where i denotes either the left l or the right r wind turbine can be computed as 11 β i t k p β i t ω i g e n t ω g e n r e f k i β i t 0 t ω i g e n t ω g e n r e f d t k q 6 i q 6 t q 6 t where k p β and k i β are respectively the proportional and integral gain scheduling laws for the baseline oc3 hywind pi control on the generator speed ω g e n t is the generator speed ω g e n r e f is the reference rated generator speed q 6 t is the platform yaw motion in radians and k q 6 q 6 is the proportional gain scheduling law for the p control on the platform yaw motion which can be expressed as 12 if i l k q 6 i 0 if q 6 0 k q 6 i k p q 6 if q 6 0 if i r k q 6 i k p q 6 if q 6 0 k q 6 i 0 if q 6 0 where k p q 6 is the constant gain to be determined from tuning analysis fig 7 shows the block diagram representation of the coupled control strategy yaw motion is positive if counterclockwise when the left rotor is considered the yaw p control contribution is active only if yaw motion is negative on the other hand the right rotor yaw p control contribution is active only if the yaw motion is positive the absolute value of the yaw control contribution is used to compute the final rotor collective blade pitch angle induced by yaw dynamics the standard oc3 variable speed generator torque control as well as saturations of the rotor collective blade pitch angles and pitch rates are also enforced in both cases jonkman 2007 while the pi control on the generator speed is only active if the generator rotational speed reaches rated values the p control on yaw motion is always activated table 7 summarizes the control gains used in this work as it will be described in detail in section 5 2 a constant gain for the yaw control equal to 1 5 is selected fig 8 shows a time history of about 500 s of the rotor collective blade pitch angle dynamics and thrust forces for both wind turbines of the 2wt concept with coupled control the control dynamic response is associated to above rated environmental conditions lc3 table 6 the plot also shows the associated yaw response the effect of the linear coupling between the baseline oc3 pi control and the yaw p control is clearly noticeable as well as the associated influence on the rotor thrusts 5 results the integration method dassl is employed to solve the equations of motion of the system with a tolerance equal to 1 10 6 and a time step equal to 0 1 s a simulation time equal to 4000 s is carried out the first 400 s are discarded in order to let the initial transients of the system die out the effective time series used to compute results are thus about 1 h long three systems are tested under the same environmental conditions the baseline oc3 design the 2wt concept with oc3 baseline control and the same 2wt system with coupled control as described in section 4 5 every system employs mooring lines with a mass density of 200 kg m the dynamic response results are given in terms of platform motion q upstream fairlead tension t 2 and electric power production p e and are expressed in terms of overall mean values μ and standard deviations σ 5 1 system natural periods table 8 summarizes the damped natural frequencies of the 2wt system as computed from free decay tests in modelica the results obtained are compared against the damped natural frequencies of the oc3 system when the mooring mass density is equivalent to either the one used in the 2wt system 200 kg m or to the standard value found in the literature 77 7 kg m jonkman 2007 the yaw stiffness of the oc3 system is assumed constant in the two cases the assumption is reflected in a constant oc3 yaw period for different mooring characteristics higher inertia involved in the 2wt system lead to significantly higher surge and yaw periods with respect to the oc3 system as expected from preliminary hydrostatic considerations 2wt heave and pitch periods are for this configuration sufficiently longer than the limit imposed to avoid first order wave excitations 5 2 effect of yaw control proportional gain tuning coupled control generally the tuning process of pi pid wind turbine controllers is first obtained using methods such as pole placement or ziegler nichols and then refined by the employment of fully coupled aeroelastic simulations to obtain an optimized tuning in terms of loads reduction and motion regulation ziegler and nichols 1993 mirzaei et al 2016 on this line hansen et al 2005 determined the gains of a standard rotor collective blade pitch pi controller by employing a minimization of the blade root flapwise bending moments tibaldi et al 2012 performed a fine tuning of two pi controllers respectively associated with below rated and above rated environmental conditions by minimizing a cost function based on fatigue loads ultimate loads annual energy production and blade pitch actuator duty cycle control gain tuning is hence a trade off analysis necessary in order to identify the best tuning setup under contrasting objectives the main goal of the current analysis is to quantify the capability of a coupled control strategy to mitigate the platform yaw motion of the 2wt system for this reason a simple proportional control of the platform yaw motion is linearly superimposed to the oc3 baseline rotor collective blade pitch pi control as presented in section 4 5 the tuning process is only focused on the additional proportional gain k p while the baseline pi controller retains the original oc3 gain scheduling jonkman 2007 the study of more advanced controllers as well as the study of more thorough tuning strategies being able to further optimize the system response are left as questions for further research the tuning is performed heuristically and the main drivers are the following 1 the minimization of platform yaw standard deviation 2 the maximization of the mean electric power output and 3 the minimization of the rotor collective blade pitch angles standard deviation which can be correlated with the aerodynamic thrust torque and the associated blade root loads standard deviation fig 9 illustrates the standard deviations of platform yaw surge and pitch motions electric power output and rotor collective blade pitch angles of the 2wt system in relation to k p for below rated rated and above rated environmental conditions the platform yaw motion standard deviation reduces significantly for every environmental condition reaching a minimum region at k p 2 for above rated environmental conditions the yaw motion standard deviation increases significantly at high k p values due to stalled induced thrust fluctuations platform surge and pitch standard deviations are not notably affected by k p it can be noted how the rotor collective blade pitch angles standard deviation is zero for k p 0 at below rated environmental conditions given by the lack of the pi controller contribution to the system response the rotor collective blade pitch angles standard deviation greatly increases with greater values of k p showing values higher than 2 deg for k p 2 fig 10 illustrates the mean values for the same response parameters used in fig 9 platform surge and pitch mean motion reduces at high k p values for below rated environmental conditions caused by the increased rotor collective blade pitch mean angle and the associated reduction of aerodynamic thrust the aerodynamic torque is reduced in the same manner leading to a reduction of the overall electric power output for k p 4 the electric power output loss is about 288kw as listed in table 7 the constant yaw control proportional gain selected for the present work is 1 5 under this tuning schedule platform yaw motion is minimized at the cost of an electric power output loss of 100 kw for below rated environmental conditions and the increase of rotor collective blade pitch angle standard deviation in the range of 0 5 2 deg 5 3 dynamic response fig 11 shows the overall mean values for surge and pitch motion electric power production and upstream fairlead tension under different load cases for the oc3 system the 2wt system configured with baseline oc3 control and the 2wt system configured with the coupled control platform sway heave and roll motions are found to be small for each system and thus are not depicted in the results changing the rotor collective blade pitch control strategy from the baseline oc3 to the coupled control strategy does not influence significantly the mean response of the 2wt system as it is clear from the figure the mean surge values are significantly lower in the oc3 system with respect to the 2wt concept at each load case about twice the values obtained in the system this is clearly associated with the doubling of aerodynamic thrust force in the 2wt concept the maximum surge response in the 2wt concept is about 30 m and is obtained at the rated operating wind speed the mean pitch values obtained in the oc3 system are higher with respect to the 2wt concept the difference is of about 1 deg at the rated operating wind speed as the pitch angle is one of the floating platform chief design drivers it may be concluded that some margin is still available to further optimize the platform design the mean electric power production is broken down into single rotor performance since the mean values are computed from single 1 h realizations of turbulent responses the mean electric power production for all rotors at rated and above rated operating wind speed is lower than the rated power of 5 mw clifton and wagner 2014 this is due to fluctuations of the generator speed in the below rated region moreover the aerodynamic model employed in this work does not allow for assessment of the contribution of complex aerodynamic effects on the system performance especially with respect to aerodynamic efficiency and consequently electric power production consequently the mean electric production obtained at below rated speed for the 2wt system with baseline oc3 control is similar to the one obtained in the oc3 system the interaction effect may be significant and is therefore left at this stage as a question for further research fig 12 shows the standard deviations for platform surge and pitch motion electric power production and upstream fairlead tension for the same load cases and system configurations given in fig 11 the pattern obtained is similar to the one characterizing the mean values standard deviations obtained for the 2wt system under different control strategies are found to be similar the electric power production standard deviations associated with the 2wt rotors are found to differ by about 100 kw particularly at below rated wind speed the difference is reasonably associated with the different wind velocity profiles at the hub locations tension standard deviation is important when evaluating the probability of line slack and fatigue life in order to avoid slack conditions the tension standard deviation must be sufficiently smaller than its associated mean value bachynski and moan 2012 the standard deviation of the upstream fairlead tension for the 2wt system at the rated operating wind speed is significantly higher than in the oc3 system however the tension standard deviation is relatively small if compared with its associated mean value ratio σ μ 0 07 implying that the current mooring layout may be sufficient to withstand survival environmental conditions cheng et al 2017 5 4 yaw response fig 13 shows the time histories for the platform yaw motion at the rated operating wind speed lc2 and the standard deviations for the environmental conditions used in the analysis see table 6 the transversal distribution of thrust loads given by the two rotor configuration significantly affects yaw motion the response is characterized by long periods this can be correlated with the concentration of wind turbulence energy in the low frequency region li et al 2019 the maximum yaw angle in the 2wt concept operating with the baseline oc3 control strategy is about 21 6 deg and it is obtained at the rated operating wind speed while the associated standard deviation is about 6 5 deg the coupled control strategy proposed in this work albeit simply implementing a proportional control on the platform yaw motion reduces the overall yaw response of about 60 the maximum yaw angle at the rated operating wind speed reduces to about 7 7 deg while the associated standard deviation reduces to about 2 5 deg the thrust discrepancy at the hubs increases with turbulence intensity thus increasing the standard deviation of platform yaw motion fig 14 shows the standard deviation for platform yaw motion as a function of the turbulence intensity i computed at the rated operating wind speed 11 4 m s platform yaw motion is nonlinearly correlated with the wind turbulence level the significant reduction of the yaw standard deviation in the case the system operates with a coupled control strategy endures at varying turbulence intensities it is also clear how the standard deviation for platform yaw motion is zero when the wind profile is not turbulent σ q 6 i 0 0 5 5 mooring configuration a simple parametric mooring line design of the 2wt system is performed in terms of the effect of the mooring lines equivalent mass density on the system response computed at rated operating wind speed lc2 the associated findings are illustrated in fig 15 the mooring lines diameter is equal to 0 09 m and the unstretched mooring line length is equal to 902 2 m for an equivalent mass density of 170 kg m the peak minimum seabed length is negative i e no portion of the mooring line rests on the seabed and the anchor tension includes a nonzero vertical component in order to ensure excess mooring line length an equivalent mass density higher than 190 kg m is thus necessary peak platform surge motion decreases with increasing mooring line weight 6 conclusions the dynamic analysis of a two rotor wind turbine mounted on a spar type floating platform has been performed a simple structural analysis showed how a mass saving of about 26 may be achieved by employing the two rotor configuration instead of an equivalent single rotor configuration the numerical simulations showed an increased low frequency yaw response of the two rotor system compared with the response of a single rotor configuration of about 6 deg standard deviation at the rated operating wind speed the yaw excitation is directly induced by the turbulence intensity at the hub and the transversal distribution of thrust loads on the structure a rotor collective blade pitch angle coupled control has been proposed for the mitigation of yaw response the numerical simulations showed a reduction of the yaw response of about 60 at the cost of a reduction of mean power output at below rated wind speed of about 100 kw in addition parametric analysis showed that an equivalent mass density of the mooring lines of at least 190 kg m is necessary in the 2wt in order to avoid vertical loads at the anchors stiffer mooring lines configurations in yaw direction would also reduce platform yaw response the analysis is based on in house code developed in modelica the aerodynamic model is based on mapping the steady state aerodynamic coefficients characteristic of the wind turbines employed the approach is therefore not able to assess complex aerodynamic situations which may be significant skewed effects on the aerodynamic efficiency of the blades especially related to the significant platform yaw angles cannot be considered to date moreover the aerodynamic interaction between the rotors is not assessed subjects for future work include the study of the aforementioned aerodynamic effects the study of more advanced strategies for multi rotor floating wind turbines control as well as aeroelastic effects and tower structural dynamics interactions moreover the aerodynamic interaction between the rotors should be investigated and included in the dynamic model finally an optimal station keeping configuration able to maximize yaw stiffness an optimal platform configuration for multi rotor applications as well as fault effects of rotors and control system should be investigated credit

20361,the dynamic response of a two rotor wind turbine mounted on a spar type floating platform is studied the response is compared against the baseline oc3 single rotor design structural design shows how the two rotor design may lead to a mass saving of about 26 with respect to an equivalent single rotor configuration simulations predict significant platform yaw response of the two rotor floating wind turbine about 6 deg standard deviation at the rated operating wind speed it is shown how the platform yaw response is directly caused by the turbulence intensity at the hub coupled with the transversal distribution of thrust loads on the structure a coupled control strategy for the rotor collective blade pitch controller is proposed in which a simple proportional control mitigating platform yaw motion is superimposed to the baseline oc3 pi controller numerical simulations show how platform yaw response is reduced by about 60 at the cost of mean power loss at below rated wind speeds of about 100 kw and maximum increase of the rotor collective blade pitch angles standard deviation of about 2 deg parametric analysis of mooring lines design shows how an equivalent mass density of the line of at least 190 kg m is needed to avoid vertical loads at the anchors keywords floating offshore wind turbines dynamic analysis multi rotor wind turbines spar buoy platform modelica 1 introduction offshore wind energy is a steadily growing industry reaching in 2019 a total worldwide offshore wind power capacity of 30 gw out of a total worldwide wind power capacity of 600 gw gwec 2019 offshore wind energy is appealing since wind speed is much greater offshore than inland and since many of the drawbacks of wind turbine deployment derives from interaction with populated areas cruz and atcheson 2016 ideal wind energy sites are mostly locations where water depth far exceeds 50 m while bottom fixed offshore wind turbines are economically feasible to be deployed only in shallow water depths jonkman 2007 floating wind turbines fowts able to be deployed in deep waters offer a technological solution and may thus help in the reduction of the overall levelized cost of energy lcoe associated with wind energy reduction of the overall lcoe may in principle be achieved also by means of downscaling wind turbines into equivalent multi rotor systems two or more wind turbines installed on the same structure the development of multi rotor wind turbines is an old idea first developed early in the 20th century when the lack of advanced glass fiber composite materials made the manufacturing of large rotors unfeasible jamieson and branney 2012 the rated power of a wind turbine is proportional to the net area swept by the rotor blades it thus scales with the square of the rotor radius however the blade mass generally increases with the cube of the rotor radius thus making an array of smaller turbine units advantageous jamieson and branney 2012 multi rotor wind turbine concepts are also interesting from an economical and logistical perspective since small blades are easier to manufacture transport and deploy with respect to state of the art blade sizes vestas wind systems a s installed a multi rotor demonstrator at the technical university of denmark named 4r v29 composed of four 225kw wind turbines mounted on a single structure and in operation between 2016 and 2019 van der laan et al 2019 recently compared numerical results obtained from several reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans tools against field measurements of power performance and wake deficit showing faster wake recovery and marginally higher power output at below rated environmental conditions given by the rotors aerodynamic interaction bastankhah et al bastankhah and abkar 2019 also performed a large eddy simulation to study the wake flow properties of a similar four rotor concept they found out that the wake recovery is faster at short downwind distances with respect to a single rotor system the eu funded project innwind jamieson et al 2015 proposed a 20 mw configuration composed of 45 turbines 444 kw each conclusions claimed a reduction of the lcoe against an equivalent single rotor configuration of about 15 kirchner bossi and porté agel 2020 showed that the optimization of the layout of multi rotor wind farms may lead to significant benefits also in terms of overall power density compared to a baseline single rotor wind farm layout research of multi rotor concepts mounted on floating platforms is to date scant first concepts date back to the time of the earliest works in the field such as the work of heronemus 1972 multiple unit floating offshore windfarm mufow barltrop 1993 was a uk based project started in 1993 aiming at the investigation of the feasibility of arrays of wind turbines mounted on a single floating platform however the idea has yet to be studied thoroughly and its feasibility has yet to be analyzed in detail the overall dynamic response of the floating system must be carefully studied as well as the aerodynamic interaction of the rotors under operative and extreme environmental conditions in this work the dynamic response of a two rotor wind turbine mounted on a spar floating platform is studied the study relies upon a reduced aerodynamic model simplified yet adequate to get the overall dynamic characteristics of the multi rotor fowt concept the advantageous stability and relatively simple design and manufacturing of spar type platforms made it one of the most studied designs over the years and the abundance of reference designs makes it suitable to be used in conceptual analyses phase iv oc3 for instance is widely used as a major reference design jonkman 2010 2009a full scale deployment of floating wind turbines also utilized spar type design as in hywind demo equinor 2020a the first full scale prototype of a fowt deployed in norway in 2009 as well as in hywind scotland equinor 2020b the first floating wind farm situated in scotland and commissioned in 2017 the analysis of this work relies on an in house tool for the simplified fully coupled analysis of fowts concepts the predictive tool is developed in modelica a non proprietary declarative object oriented language developed by the non profit modelica association and employed to conveniently model multi domain systems the modelica association 2020 the multi rotor fowt system is modeled as a rigid body a dummy degree of freedom dof describing the simplified rigid rotor dynamics is added to the system equations of motion eqm in order to determine the aerodynamic state of the system the aerodynamic loads are then modeled as concentrated thrusts acting on the rotor hubs and as concentrated torques acting on the rotor low speed shafts the aerodynamic loads are computed by considering the relative velocity between the hub and wind transversal to the rotor plane and mapping the steady state aerodynamic coefficients of the wind turbine this method is thought of as a simplified alternative to more complex beam element momentum bem models and previous work el beshbichi et al 2021 showed how results obtained are accurate in terms of overall dynamic response in operative environmental conditions the method however presents major limitations when considering more complex dynamic interactions the rotors flexibility and dynamic contributions to the overall system dynamics are neglected the aerodynamic interaction between rotors as well as the aerodynamic effects induced by skewed flows are also not considered the present work is structured as follows first the two rotor wind turbine concept 2wt is presented a simple structural study is carried out in order to define first attempt tower dimensions and inertial properties moreover the spar platform design is carried out by setting forth general hydrostatic performance considerations next the dynamic response of the 2wt system is analyzed and contrasted with the response of the reference oc3 floating wind turbine the response of the 2wt system is analyzed by means of two different rotor collective blade pitch control strategies the baseline oc3 controller and a coupled controller that incorporates mitigation of yaw response finally remarks about mooring lines dimensioning applied to the 2wt system are given 2 multi rotor wind turbine concept fig 1 shows the multi rotor wind turbine concept defined in the present work in relation to the standard oc3 design jonkman 2007 2010 the concept is composed of a two rotor wind turbine mounted on a spar buoy floating platform as in any new technology development the multi rotor fwt will eventually converge to the most optimal concept this means that the oc3 spar design might not be the most optimal concept for the multi rotor wt however the oc3 spar design has been studied extensively by a large number of researchers over the last decade using this concept in the present paper offers the advantage of greatly aiding result assessment the hub height from the sea water level swl is about 90 m while the horizontal distance between the hubs is about 138 6 m the center of gravity cog of the oc3 system is about 78 m from the swl while it is about 100 9 m for the 2wt system standard nrel 5 mw wind turbines are used in this study whose main specifications are listed in table 1 the horizontal rotor spacing is assumed to be 10 of the rotor diameter inspired by the multi rotor turbine concept installed at dtu risø by vestas a s bastankhah and abkar 2019 the 2wt tower is composed of a main vertical tapered cylinder a secondary vertical cylinder mounted on top of it and two horizontal tapered cylindrical arms supporting the rotor nacelle assemblies rnas wires are used to connect the end of the horizontal arms to the top of the vertical structure the inclination angle of the wires is 30 deg this structural geometry allows for distribution of the aerodynamic loads on the horizontal arms as bending loads while the wires distribute the static loads given by the arms self weight and rnas concentrated weight at the hubs as compression loads on the main structure the assessment of local buckling resistance is neglected at this stage in the context of the present work a simple structural dimensioning of the tower is carried out with the aim of defining first attempt global inertia properties of the fowt system the following study is thus simplified and not intended to focus on detailed structural design table 2 shows the parameters used for the simplified structural design while table 3 summarizes the selected tower geometry in terms of cross sectional dimensions of each tower sub domain data are given in terms of inner diameter outer diameter and related thickness and are given both at the base and top of the sub structure intermediate cross sections are defined through linear tapering the structural computation assumes the maximum aerodynamic thrust acting at the hub i e 808kn for the nrel 5 mw wind turbine jonkman 2007 the wire tension and the reaction forces acting at the horizontal arms base are readily computed by solving the associated statically indeterminate beam problem the loaded cross section area must be big enough to prevent yield s y i e l d yield assessment is performed at the most stressed sections of the structure i e at the tower base and at the horizontal arm base a safety factor γ of 1 4 is used to obtain a conservative design the yield assessment can be prescribed as follows 1 4 r o u t m π r o u t 4 r i n 4 s y i e l d γ where m is the bending load acting at the base of the tower sub domain and r o u t and r i n are the outer and inner radii at the base cross section respectively maximum and minimum values of thickness are considered equal to 0 04 m and 0 001 m respectively the bending moment acting at the base of the horizontal arms is assumed given by the action of the aerodynamic thrust the rna weight concentrated at the hub and the horizontal arm self weight on the other hand the bending moment acting at the base of the vertical tower is assumed chiefly related to the action of the aerodynamic thrusts effective loads as well as the ratio between effective and yield stress are listed in table 3 the bending stress obtained is equivalent to about 94 mpa at the horizontal arms base and about 135 mpa at the vertical tower base following an utilization ratio close to 50 the total concentrated mass of the tower thus defined is about 536 9 tonnes the wire dimensioning is carried out in accordance with the recommended guidelines of the standard en1993 1 11 based on en 1990 eurocode 3 2006 the wire cross section must be big enough to prevent yield under maximum external load a value of γ equal to 1 4 is used also in this case the wire diameter can be estimated as follows eurocode 3 2006 2 d w i r e 4 t γ π f k r r where t is the wire tension r r is the wire grade f is the wire fill factor and k is the spinning loss factor the obtained wire tension is about 7730kn while the obtained wire diameter is about 107 mm the wire concentrated mass is about 4 94 tonnes 3 platform design criteria the dimensioning process of a floating platform is mainly driven by 1 the maximization of pitch stiffness in order to reduce maximum static pitch angle 2 the maximization of natural heave period in order to reduce wave induced motion and 3 the reduction of the overall cost chiefly driven by the platform mass and dimensions cruz and atcheson 2016 fatigue criteria are also applied in later design stages but may be neglected in conceptual design the design space of a spar buoy platform is generally composed of the platform draft the upper diameter d 1 and the lower diameter d 2 as major design parameters platform design parameters associated to the final system geometry adopted in this work are those depicted in fig 1 the distance between the swl and the top of the platform is equal to the value used in the standard oc3 design that is 10 m the distance between swl and the top of the lower spar section is also equal to the standard oc3 value 12 m spar thickness is assumed constant and equal to 0 05 m the platform design is carried out in terms of hydrostatic performance and simple computations can at this stage be employed in order to obtain useful predictions the following sections present a brief discussion of the common criteria used in platform design 3 1 hydrostatic considerations the major criteria used in platform design can be described as follows 1 the floating platform must achieve hydrostatic equilibrium in order to enforce the constraint the mass of the spar buoy ballast is imposed by means of the following hydrostatic vertical equilibrium 3 m b a l l a s t ρ w a t e r v w g 3 f m v m s g m t n r g g where ρ w a t e r is the water density v w is the water displaced volume g is the acceleration due to gravity f m v is the total vertical mooring line static load m s is the spar buoy mass and m t n r is the mass of tower nacelles and rotors in the design process the ballast center of gravity is assumed to be located at 5 m from the bottom of the spar buoy platform f m v is assumed equal to the vertical mooring line static load of the oc3 standard design 2 the maximum static pitch angle must be sufficiently small in order to avoid an excessive pitch dynamic response and to limit the loss of annual energy production aep due to the skewed flow conditions cruz and atcheson 2016 according to zambrano et al 2006 the maximum static pitch angle must not exceed 5 deg with 15 deg of dynamic amplitude the static pitch angle can be estimated as follows pham and shin 2019 4 θ 5 f t h r u s t h b c 55 where θ 5 is the static pitch angle f t h r u s t is the overall thrust force acting at the hubs h b is the vertical distance from the hubs to the center of buoyancy cob of the spar buoy platform and c 55 is the hydrostatic restoring pitch stiffness which can be derived from metacentric height relationships faltinsen 1993 3 the pitch and heave natural periods must be larger than 25 30 s in order to avoid resonance motions with first order wave effects bachynski and moan 2012 the heave period is estimated as follows 5 t 33 2 π m t o t a 33 ρ w a t e r g a w where m t o t is the overall fowt mass a 33 is the added mass component in heave direction and a w is the waterplane area the value used to estimate a 33 is assumed in the design stage constant and equal to the value associated with the standard oc3 platform jonkman 2010 the pitch period is estimated by considering surge pitch coupling the estimation is carried out by solving the associated surge pitch characteristic equation 6 ω 2 m t o t z c o g m t o t z c o g m t o t i 55 a 11 a 15 a 51 a 55 0 0 0 c 55 c m 11 c m 15 c m 51 c m 55 ϕ 0 where ω and ϕ are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system z c o g is the vertical location of the overall center of gravity of the fowt system i 55 is the overall pitch inertia a 11 a 15 a 51 and a 55 are respectively the added mass in surge surge pitch pitch surge and pitch directions and c m 11 c m 15 c m 51 and c m 55 are respectively the mooring linear stiffness values in surge surge pitch pitch surge and pitch directions the pitch period is simply computed as 7 t 55 2 π ω 5 where ω 5 is the eigenvalue associated with the pitch direction the values used to estimate the added mass and mooring lines linear stiffness are assumed in the design stage constant and equal to the value associated with the standard oc3 platform jonkman 2010 the mooring lines stiffness is relative to an unstretched length of 902 2 m a mass density of 77 71 kg m a vertical static length of 250 m and a diameter of 0 09 m the platform draft affects the vertical static length of the mooring lines and consequently the mooring lines stiffness hence a difference is to be expected between the dynamic response of the system and the hydrostatic results the difference is assumed to be small in pitch and heave directions and therefore tolerable in a preliminary design context 3 1 1 periods fig 2 shows the variation of heave and pitch periods of the 2wt system as a function of the draft lower diameter d 2 and higher diameter d 1 within 100 m draft 170 m 10 m d 2 12 m and d 1 either equal to 7 5 m left hand side plots or equal to 10 m right hand side plots the red dot denotes the final spar design configuration selected in the present work as shown the pitch period tends to increase in configurations with shorter draft and d 2 lengths while it does not vary substantially with variations of d 1 values obtained indicate that only for unrealistic configurations given by extremely long draft and d 2 the pitch period becomes unacceptably short the heave period tends to increase in configurations with longer draft and d 2 lengths and reduces substantially in configurations with longer d 1 lengths note that in the case of d 1 10 m the heave period reduces to values close to 25 s for feasible values of draft and d 2 also for this reason longer d 1 lengths should be avoided 3 1 2 maximum static pitch angle fig 3 shows the maximum static pitch angle of the 2wt system as a function of platform design parameters within the same value range used in fig 2 as it is clear a greater maximum static pitch angle is obtained for shorter lengths of draft and d 2 longer lengths of d 1 reduce to a minor extent the static pitch angle the isoline relative to 4 5 deg should be considered as a threshold for acceptable platform configurations note that the maximum static pitch angle is the most stringent constraint in the design of multi rotor floating wind turbines given that it eliminates most of the design space 3 1 3 mass sensitivity fig 4 shows the overall spar buoy mass including ballast as a function of platform design parameters within the same value range used in fig 2 the spar mass should always be minimized in order to reduce the construction material and deployment cost 3 2 platform configuration the selection process of a feasible platform configuration is based on a trade off among the design constraints previously mentioned the main design objective is to achieve acceptable hydrostatic performance and to minimize the platform mass to be employed drafts longer than 140 m are unfeasible to deploy and are susceptible to fatigue loading while higher d 2 lengths generally lead to excessive manufacturing and deployment costs cruz and atcheson 2016 from design considerations several conclusions can be drawn for a multi rotor fowt employing multi mw wind turbines such as the 2wt concept considered in the present study heave and pitch periods are generally not a stringent constraint within the region of feasible designs in view of the greater inertia involved for draft lengths shorter than 130 140 m the maximum static pitch angle exceeds the limit imposed of 5 deg this constraint is the most stringent of the design process higher d 1 lengths are slightly beneficial in terms of maximum static pitch angle but significantly reduce the heave period and increase the platform mass of about 500 tonnes in the present work the platform configuration selected is characterized by a draft of 140 m d 1 7 5 m and d 2 10 5 m table 4 summarizes the geometrical the inertial and the hydrostatic specifications of the configuration selected together with the specifications of the baseline oc3 spar buoy platform the fairlead depth from swl is assumed to be equally distanced from the cog and the cob as in the case of the baseline oc3 design the fairleads depth from swl is thus equal to 86 5 m the ratio between the fairlead radius and d 2 is set equal to the one used in the baseline oc3 design the fairlead radius from the centerline is thus equal to 5 78 m the overall concentrated mass of the 2wt system is about 11 8 1 0 3 tonnes the moments of inertia are computed by employing a cad model of the fowt system the rna mass is assumed to be concentrated at the hub the associated inertia tensor of the 2wt system computed at the cog can be written as follows 8 i 2 w t 6 13 1 0 10 5 93 10 5 1 67 10 7 5 93 10 5 5 77 10 10 1 47 10 5 1 67 10 7 1 47 10 5 3 69 10 9 kgm 2 table 5 shows the relative variation of mass between two standard oc3 wind turbine units and an equivalent 2wt concept even without performing structural optimization the present 2wt design brings about a significant mass saving of about 26 3 with respect to an equivalent single rotor configuration equivalently the rated power to weight ratio associated to the 2wt concept is about 0 85 w kg in place of 0 61 w kg of the oc3 hywind design however the power to weight ratio does not consider the overall power performance of the system but assumes rated power for each rotor as independent systems the aerodynamic performance of the 2wt design must be carefully studied by considering all the major aerodynamic effects and interactions before an accurate statement on power performance can be drawn 4 fully coupled dynamic analysis in this work the coupled dynamic behavior of the 2wt concept is studied by employing an in house code implemented by means of the object oriented language modelica the approach allows for easy implementation of arbitrary platform geometries and platform rotor configurations previous benchmarking work el beshbichi et al 2021 based on the international energy agency iea code to code comparisons for the baseline oc3 design jonkman et al 2010 has also shown how this method gives good agreement to well established dynamic codes in situations where rotor dynamic contribution can be neglected the system is assumed to be rigid the hydrodynamic added damping values employed are assumed equal to those associated with the baseline oc3 design albeit yaw mooring stiffness is associated with the mooring lines design in this work its value is assumed constant and equal to the one characterizing the baseline oc3 design the rotor inertial effects including the contribution of gyroscopic effects on the system dynamics are not considered 4 1 environmental conditions three specific load cases lcs are considered in this work each case is characterized by directionally congruent turbulent wind and irregular waves based on standard jonswap spectra table 6 summarizes the characteristics of the lcs selected the cases considered are relative to different environmental severity regions the first case lc1 is relative to a below rated operational wind speed the second case lc2 is relative to the rated operational wind speed and the last case lc3 is relative to above rated operational wind speed wave energy content increases accordingly the turbulence intensity at the hub follows the kaimal spectrum with iec class b normal turbulence model ntm based on the standard iec 61400 1 iec 2005 4 2 hydrodynamic modeling the hydrodynamic loads are computed from linear airy wave theory airy theory can be applied if the water depth is sufficiently deep dnv gl 2010 the numerical panel code sesam wadam dnv gl dnv gl 2020 is used to solve the frequency domain linear hydrodynamic problem relative to the selected platform geometry time realizations of irregular wave loads are preventively computed by means of inverse fourier transformations ift the additional load contribution associated with hydrodynamic viscous drag is not considered in this work c d 0 however it should be noted that viscous drag loads may be significant in extreme environmental situations where much larger waves and current effects are considered zheng et al 2020 4 3 mooring lines modeling mooring lines design is assumed in this work equal to the standard oc3 design that is three catenary mooring lines mounted at 120 deg from one another jonkman 2010 fig 5 shows a top view schematization of the standard mooring system employed in the 2wt spar buoy platform based on the oc3 design h f 1 2 3 are the horizontal mooring loads acting at the fairleads even though the delta catenary mooring lines used in the oc3 hywind platform are not subject to significant yaw moments their designs allow for yaw stiffness which may be easily increased by increasing the fairlead length a quasi static formulation of the mooring lines loads is employed in order to obtain the loads displacements relationship at the fairleads jonkman 2007 the effect of the mooring lines design on the yaw stiffness is neglected and a constant equivalent yaw stiffness of 9 8 10 7 nm rad is used throughout the results to account for the effect of the delta lines moreover the oc3 hywind load displacement relationship in the platform s yaw direction is found to be linear at least up to a platform s yaw angle of about 20 deg jonkman 2010 a linear stiffness relationship can then be used also where the platform s yaw motion is considered significant the mooring lines mass density used is set in this work equal to 200 kg m 4 4 aerodynamic modeling in this work the aerodynamic loads are computed by mapping the steady state thrust and torque aerodynamic coefficients of each rotor this approach is different to standard codes where a full bem method is employed and to simplified codes where the aerodynamic thrust is simply computed as function of the wind speed karimirad and moan 2012 integrated loads are used and hence the distribution of the local aerodynamic loads and the associated local moments on the blades is neglected karimirad and moan 2012 a simplified rigid rotor eqm is considered to emulate the rotors aerodynamic response aerodynamic concentrated thrusts are applied at the hubs while aerodynamic concentrated torques are applied at the equivalent low speed rotor shafts the relative velocity between hub and wind speed transversal to the rotor plane is used the thrust loads are computed as el beshbichi et al 2021 9 f 1 2 ρ a i r c t λ β a u r e l 2 where ρ a i r is the air density c t is the steady state thrust coefficient λ is the tip speed ratio β is the rotor collective blade pitch angle a is the rotor plane area and u r e l is the relative speed between local wind and hub the torque loads are computed as 10 t 1 2 ρ a i r r c q λ β a u r e l 2 where r is the rotor radius and c q is the steady state torque coefficient the three dimensional wind velocity profiles at the hubs are computed in jonkman 2009b and imported in the code a 15x15 grid is used wide enough to encompass the rotors space and a time step of 0 05 s is used to generate the wind profiles wind time histories of 4000 s are computed for each environmental condition this method although generating accurate overall dynamic predictions in operational environmental conditions is not able to detect more complex aerodynamic effects for instance the wind profile time realizations used for the computation of the concentrated aerodynamic loads are associated only with the hub locations this assumption neglects the spatial turbulence variation on the rotors swept area the effect of the horizontal arms on the local wind induction factors is also not considered moreover skewed blade aerodynamics is not considered as well as the aerodynamic interaction between the rotors albeit literature on similar multi rotor fowts is scant research works in different fields concerning similar applications such as the study of thrust deficit induced by the aerodynamic interaction among rotors of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs zhou et al 2017 alvarez and ning 2017 suggest that the effect of the rotor aerodynamic interaction on the overall system response may not be significant enough to compromise the general dynamic behavior obtained in the present study at any rate the significance of these effects on multi rotor fowt system dynamics can be quantified by employing corrected bem aerodynamic capabilities in modelica which is a task currently under development the tower base local reference frame is assumed placed at the same inertial location for all configurations fig 6 shows the wind profiles relative to the same realization and attributed to the hub locations for the oc3 wind turbine the 2wt left wind turbine 2wtl and the 2wt right wind turbine 2wtr the time histories are relative to a mean wind speed of 8 m s lc1 4 5 control modeling as it will be presented in detail in section 5 4 the platform yaw motion response of the 2wt is particularly critical for this reason the quantification of the feasibility of mitigating the platform yaw motion by means of an optimized rotor collective blade pitch control strategy is proposed the pitch actuator dynamics is assumed fast enough to be neglected for rigid dynamics analysis that is there is no delay between the reference pitch angle and the actual pitch angle a second order low pass filter can generally be used to represent pitch actuator dynamics common values for cut off frequency and damping ratio are about 1 hz and 0 7 respectively fast compared to the system dynamics dunne and pao 2016 two rotor collective blade pitch control strategies are separately applied to the 2wt concept the controls employed are the following oc3 baseline control the standard oc3 pi rotor collective blade pitch control on the generator speed as described in jonkman 2007 is used to independently control both rotors coupled control the baseline oc3 baseline pi rotor collective blade pitch control on the generator speed is linearly coupled with a proportional rotor collective blade pitch control on the 2wt platform yaw motion the coupled control strategy proposed is designed to induce a reduction of aerodynamic thrust at the hub whose surge motion brought about by the yaw dynamics is positive the rotor collective blade pitch angle β i where i denotes either the left l or the right r wind turbine can be computed as 11 β i t k p β i t ω i g e n t ω g e n r e f k i β i t 0 t ω i g e n t ω g e n r e f d t k q 6 i q 6 t q 6 t where k p β and k i β are respectively the proportional and integral gain scheduling laws for the baseline oc3 hywind pi control on the generator speed ω g e n t is the generator speed ω g e n r e f is the reference rated generator speed q 6 t is the platform yaw motion in radians and k q 6 q 6 is the proportional gain scheduling law for the p control on the platform yaw motion which can be expressed as 12 if i l k q 6 i 0 if q 6 0 k q 6 i k p q 6 if q 6 0 if i r k q 6 i k p q 6 if q 6 0 k q 6 i 0 if q 6 0 where k p q 6 is the constant gain to be determined from tuning analysis fig 7 shows the block diagram representation of the coupled control strategy yaw motion is positive if counterclockwise when the left rotor is considered the yaw p control contribution is active only if yaw motion is negative on the other hand the right rotor yaw p control contribution is active only if the yaw motion is positive the absolute value of the yaw control contribution is used to compute the final rotor collective blade pitch angle induced by yaw dynamics the standard oc3 variable speed generator torque control as well as saturations of the rotor collective blade pitch angles and pitch rates are also enforced in both cases jonkman 2007 while the pi control on the generator speed is only active if the generator rotational speed reaches rated values the p control on yaw motion is always activated table 7 summarizes the control gains used in this work as it will be described in detail in section 5 2 a constant gain for the yaw control equal to 1 5 is selected fig 8 shows a time history of about 500 s of the rotor collective blade pitch angle dynamics and thrust forces for both wind turbines of the 2wt concept with coupled control the control dynamic response is associated to above rated environmental conditions lc3 table 6 the plot also shows the associated yaw response the effect of the linear coupling between the baseline oc3 pi control and the yaw p control is clearly noticeable as well as the associated influence on the rotor thrusts 5 results the integration method dassl is employed to solve the equations of motion of the system with a tolerance equal to 1 10 6 and a time step equal to 0 1 s a simulation time equal to 4000 s is carried out the first 400 s are discarded in order to let the initial transients of the system die out the effective time series used to compute results are thus about 1 h long three systems are tested under the same environmental conditions the baseline oc3 design the 2wt concept with oc3 baseline control and the same 2wt system with coupled control as described in section 4 5 every system employs mooring lines with a mass density of 200 kg m the dynamic response results are given in terms of platform motion q upstream fairlead tension t 2 and electric power production p e and are expressed in terms of overall mean values μ and standard deviations σ 5 1 system natural periods table 8 summarizes the damped natural frequencies of the 2wt system as computed from free decay tests in modelica the results obtained are compared against the damped natural frequencies of the oc3 system when the mooring mass density is equivalent to either the one used in the 2wt system 200 kg m or to the standard value found in the literature 77 7 kg m jonkman 2007 the yaw stiffness of the oc3 system is assumed constant in the two cases the assumption is reflected in a constant oc3 yaw period for different mooring characteristics higher inertia involved in the 2wt system lead to significantly higher surge and yaw periods with respect to the oc3 system as expected from preliminary hydrostatic considerations 2wt heave and pitch periods are for this configuration sufficiently longer than the limit imposed to avoid first order wave excitations 5 2 effect of yaw control proportional gain tuning coupled control generally the tuning process of pi pid wind turbine controllers is first obtained using methods such as pole placement or ziegler nichols and then refined by the employment of fully coupled aeroelastic simulations to obtain an optimized tuning in terms of loads reduction and motion regulation ziegler and nichols 1993 mirzaei et al 2016 on this line hansen et al 2005 determined the gains of a standard rotor collective blade pitch pi controller by employing a minimization of the blade root flapwise bending moments tibaldi et al 2012 performed a fine tuning of two pi controllers respectively associated with below rated and above rated environmental conditions by minimizing a cost function based on fatigue loads ultimate loads annual energy production and blade pitch actuator duty cycle control gain tuning is hence a trade off analysis necessary in order to identify the best tuning setup under contrasting objectives the main goal of the current analysis is to quantify the capability of a coupled control strategy to mitigate the platform yaw motion of the 2wt system for this reason a simple proportional control of the platform yaw motion is linearly superimposed to the oc3 baseline rotor collective blade pitch pi control as presented in section 4 5 the tuning process is only focused on the additional proportional gain k p while the baseline pi controller retains the original oc3 gain scheduling jonkman 2007 the study of more advanced controllers as well as the study of more thorough tuning strategies being able to further optimize the system response are left as questions for further research the tuning is performed heuristically and the main drivers are the following 1 the minimization of platform yaw standard deviation 2 the maximization of the mean electric power output and 3 the minimization of the rotor collective blade pitch angles standard deviation which can be correlated with the aerodynamic thrust torque and the associated blade root loads standard deviation fig 9 illustrates the standard deviations of platform yaw surge and pitch motions electric power output and rotor collective blade pitch angles of the 2wt system in relation to k p for below rated rated and above rated environmental conditions the platform yaw motion standard deviation reduces significantly for every environmental condition reaching a minimum region at k p 2 for above rated environmental conditions the yaw motion standard deviation increases significantly at high k p values due to stalled induced thrust fluctuations platform surge and pitch standard deviations are not notably affected by k p it can be noted how the rotor collective blade pitch angles standard deviation is zero for k p 0 at below rated environmental conditions given by the lack of the pi controller contribution to the system response the rotor collective blade pitch angles standard deviation greatly increases with greater values of k p showing values higher than 2 deg for k p 2 fig 10 illustrates the mean values for the same response parameters used in fig 9 platform surge and pitch mean motion reduces at high k p values for below rated environmental conditions caused by the increased rotor collective blade pitch mean angle and the associated reduction of aerodynamic thrust the aerodynamic torque is reduced in the same manner leading to a reduction of the overall electric power output for k p 4 the electric power output loss is about 288kw as listed in table 7 the constant yaw control proportional gain selected for the present work is 1 5 under this tuning schedule platform yaw motion is minimized at the cost of an electric power output loss of 100 kw for below rated environmental conditions and the increase of rotor collective blade pitch angle standard deviation in the range of 0 5 2 deg 5 3 dynamic response fig 11 shows the overall mean values for surge and pitch motion electric power production and upstream fairlead tension under different load cases for the oc3 system the 2wt system configured with baseline oc3 control and the 2wt system configured with the coupled control platform sway heave and roll motions are found to be small for each system and thus are not depicted in the results changing the rotor collective blade pitch control strategy from the baseline oc3 to the coupled control strategy does not influence significantly the mean response of the 2wt system as it is clear from the figure the mean surge values are significantly lower in the oc3 system with respect to the 2wt concept at each load case about twice the values obtained in the system this is clearly associated with the doubling of aerodynamic thrust force in the 2wt concept the maximum surge response in the 2wt concept is about 30 m and is obtained at the rated operating wind speed the mean pitch values obtained in the oc3 system are higher with respect to the 2wt concept the difference is of about 1 deg at the rated operating wind speed as the pitch angle is one of the floating platform chief design drivers it may be concluded that some margin is still available to further optimize the platform design the mean electric power production is broken down into single rotor performance since the mean values are computed from single 1 h realizations of turbulent responses the mean electric power production for all rotors at rated and above rated operating wind speed is lower than the rated power of 5 mw clifton and wagner 2014 this is due to fluctuations of the generator speed in the below rated region moreover the aerodynamic model employed in this work does not allow for assessment of the contribution of complex aerodynamic effects on the system performance especially with respect to aerodynamic efficiency and consequently electric power production consequently the mean electric production obtained at below rated speed for the 2wt system with baseline oc3 control is similar to the one obtained in the oc3 system the interaction effect may be significant and is therefore left at this stage as a question for further research fig 12 shows the standard deviations for platform surge and pitch motion electric power production and upstream fairlead tension for the same load cases and system configurations given in fig 11 the pattern obtained is similar to the one characterizing the mean values standard deviations obtained for the 2wt system under different control strategies are found to be similar the electric power production standard deviations associated with the 2wt rotors are found to differ by about 100 kw particularly at below rated wind speed the difference is reasonably associated with the different wind velocity profiles at the hub locations tension standard deviation is important when evaluating the probability of line slack and fatigue life in order to avoid slack conditions the tension standard deviation must be sufficiently smaller than its associated mean value bachynski and moan 2012 the standard deviation of the upstream fairlead tension for the 2wt system at the rated operating wind speed is significantly higher than in the oc3 system however the tension standard deviation is relatively small if compared with its associated mean value ratio σ μ 0 07 implying that the current mooring layout may be sufficient to withstand survival environmental conditions cheng et al 2017 5 4 yaw response fig 13 shows the time histories for the platform yaw motion at the rated operating wind speed lc2 and the standard deviations for the environmental conditions used in the analysis see table 6 the transversal distribution of thrust loads given by the two rotor configuration significantly affects yaw motion the response is characterized by long periods this can be correlated with the concentration of wind turbulence energy in the low frequency region li et al 2019 the maximum yaw angle in the 2wt concept operating with the baseline oc3 control strategy is about 21 6 deg and it is obtained at the rated operating wind speed while the associated standard deviation is about 6 5 deg the coupled control strategy proposed in this work albeit simply implementing a proportional control on the platform yaw motion reduces the overall yaw response of about 60 the maximum yaw angle at the rated operating wind speed reduces to about 7 7 deg while the associated standard deviation reduces to about 2 5 deg the thrust discrepancy at the hubs increases with turbulence intensity thus increasing the standard deviation of platform yaw motion fig 14 shows the standard deviation for platform yaw motion as a function of the turbulence intensity i computed at the rated operating wind speed 11 4 m s platform yaw motion is nonlinearly correlated with the wind turbulence level the significant reduction of the yaw standard deviation in the case the system operates with a coupled control strategy endures at varying turbulence intensities it is also clear how the standard deviation for platform yaw motion is zero when the wind profile is not turbulent σ q 6 i 0 0 5 5 mooring configuration a simple parametric mooring line design of the 2wt system is performed in terms of the effect of the mooring lines equivalent mass density on the system response computed at rated operating wind speed lc2 the associated findings are illustrated in fig 15 the mooring lines diameter is equal to 0 09 m and the unstretched mooring line length is equal to 902 2 m for an equivalent mass density of 170 kg m the peak minimum seabed length is negative i e no portion of the mooring line rests on the seabed and the anchor tension includes a nonzero vertical component in order to ensure excess mooring line length an equivalent mass density higher than 190 kg m is thus necessary peak platform surge motion decreases with increasing mooring line weight 6 conclusions the dynamic analysis of a two rotor wind turbine mounted on a spar type floating platform has been performed a simple structural analysis showed how a mass saving of about 26 may be achieved by employing the two rotor configuration instead of an equivalent single rotor configuration the numerical simulations showed an increased low frequency yaw response of the two rotor system compared with the response of a single rotor configuration of about 6 deg standard deviation at the rated operating wind speed the yaw excitation is directly induced by the turbulence intensity at the hub and the transversal distribution of thrust loads on the structure a rotor collective blade pitch angle coupled control has been proposed for the mitigation of yaw response the numerical simulations showed a reduction of the yaw response of about 60 at the cost of a reduction of mean power output at below rated wind speed of about 100 kw in addition parametric analysis showed that an equivalent mass density of the mooring lines of at least 190 kg m is necessary in the 2wt in order to avoid vertical loads at the anchors stiffer mooring lines configurations in yaw direction would also reduce platform yaw response the analysis is based on in house code developed in modelica the aerodynamic model is based on mapping the steady state aerodynamic coefficients characteristic of the wind turbines employed the approach is therefore not able to assess complex aerodynamic situations which may be significant skewed effects on the aerodynamic efficiency of the blades especially related to the significant platform yaw angles cannot be considered to date moreover the aerodynamic interaction between the rotors is not assessed subjects for future work include the study of the aforementioned aerodynamic effects the study of more advanced strategies for multi rotor floating wind turbines control as well as aeroelastic effects and tower structural dynamics interactions moreover the aerodynamic interaction between the rotors should be investigated and included in the dynamic model finally an optimal station keeping configuration able to maximize yaw stiffness an optimal platform configuration for multi rotor applications as well as fault effects of rotors and control system should be investigated credit

20362,wave induced response of a closed floating fish cage consisting of a vertical circular cylinder with an external toroidal floater is studied theoretically and experimentally a main purpose was to investigate how the internal sloshing would influence the global response of the cage the interior wave elevation and also the mean drift loads an ocean basin laboratory was used in order to minimize tank wall effects an optical system involving eight markers was used to obtain experimental values for radial elastic deformations of the cylindrical part the closer a coupled natural period between body motions and sloshing is to a corresponding natural sloshing period the more nonlinear sloshing can be in the examined case the highest coupled natural period between surge pitch and sloshing is 0 8 times the highest natural sloshing period linear potential flow theory can in general explain experimental transfer functions of rigid body motions and sloshing due to rigid body motions obtained by both regular wave and truncated white noise tests theoretical second order mean wave drift forces based on a rigid body and potential flow agree also well with experimental results resonant 3d sloshing was excited due to ovalizing hydroelastic structural modes in both regular waves and white noise tests the closeness between the corresponding structural and sloshing frequencies caused large response a linear hydroelastic analysis based on wamit and ls dyna could partly explain the response parametric resonant pitch response occurred experimentally at large wave periods partially due to in and out of water motion of portions of the floater and was explained by treating the pitch as uncoupled motion modeled by the mathieu equation the pitch motion predicted by linear potential flow theory was in general unsatisfactory when the floater was partly out of the water occasionally keywords global response mean drift forces hydroelasticity regular wave tests white noise tests 1 introduction there exists a variety of floating fish farms with net cages since salmon lice and pollution is of major concern closed fish farms have recently been proposed to have a better control over the internal water quality depending on the material closed fish cages can be divided into flexible membrane cages e g fabric semiflexible elastic cages e g grp and rigid cages e g concrete or steel they have typically a vertical symmetry axis at rest with a circular shape in the waterplane examples on diameters in the water plane are 40 50 m a pump system is needed for water exchange in the tank and waste must be removed from the tank typical steady flow velocities caused by the pumping system are 0 2 0 4 m s since the water inside a closed tank causes statically destabilizing roll and pitch moments torus shaped floaters around the fish cage have been proposed the hydrodynamic flow associated with closed fish cages differs strongly from net cages potential flow effects with wave generation caused by the cage dominate for closed fish cages while viscous flow is dominant for net cages this has consequences both for the wave induced response and mooring system analysis wave induced sloshing interior resonant wave motion becomes an issue in closed fish cages as well known in many engineering applications faltinsen and timokha 2009 lateral tank excitations involving the lowest natural sloshing frequency is of primary sloshing concern for a rigid tank when the lateral tank motion is prescribed and harmonic the liquid motion at the lowest natural sloshing frequencies can dependent on the excitation level be strongly nonlinear free surface nonlinearities can develop three dimensional 3d liquid motion for instance forced horizontal motion of a vertical circular tank in the vicinity of the lowest sloshing frequency can cause swirling or irregular chaotic 3d motions that depend on the forcing amplitude and the liquid depth the interior wave motion becomes secondary for larger wavelength to diameter ratio however it matters for roll and pitch that the interior free surface will then remain nearly horizontal when the tank is part of a structure moving in incident waves the sloshing behavior differs from that induced by prescribed tank motion for instance if a rigid body with a tank is restrained to only move in surge the body amplitude will according to linear theory and steady state conditions be zero when the wave frequency is equal to a natural sloshing frequency ω 2 i 1 i 1 2 associated with antisymmetric natural sloshing modes the latter is a consequence of that the magnitude of the surge added mass a 11 s l o s h associated with sloshing is infinite at the natural sloshing frequencies in the case of coupled surge sloshing system the maximum response is associated with coupled surge sloshing natural frequencies ω coupl 2 i 1 the latter are solutions of the equation m t m l a 11 s l o s h ω 0 when the surge restoring force is negligible here m t is the sum of the body mass and surge added mass associated with the external flow furthermore m l is the liquid mass in the tank the reason for the coupled surge sloshing frequencies ω coupl 2 i 1 is the negative values of a 11 s l o s h which can be expressed as an infinite sum where each term is a positive constant times 1 ω 2 i 1 2 ω 2 it means that a 11 s l o s h can be positive or negative depending on the frequency the consequence is e g that ω coupl 1 ω 1 if the coupled natural frequency ω coupl 1 is very close to the natural sloshing frequency ω 1 the sloshing response can be violent faltinsen and timokha 2021 studied this problem systematically for a body with a rectangular tank in 2d flow conditions and compared with model tests by rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 they introduced the ratio m t m l as a parameter they found that ω coupl 1 ω 1 increased with decreasing m t m l and liquid depth to tank breadth ratio and that ω coupl 1 ω 1 tended to 1 without reaching 1 with increasing m t m l and liquid depth to tank breadth ratio we can generalize these findings by studying the response in the vicinity of any natural sloshing frequency and incorporating any relevant body motions in finding the coupled natural frequency for a rigid body this means either surge and pitch or sway roll and yaw rigid body heave cannot excite sloshing according to linear theory the fact that a closed fish cage can be flexible and has a vertical symmetry axis at rest introduces in particular concern for the lowest natural sloshing frequency with an ovalizing radial mode shape while nonlinearities may matter for sloshing the exterior potential flow can in many cases be based on linear potential flow theory of incompressible water for instance by shen et al 2020 corrections due to viscous flow separation may matter as damping wave drift forces are needed for the mooring analysis which can be based on a second order potential flow analysis for the exterior flow problem the coupled effect of interior water behavior on the body motions must be accounted for current can have a non negligible effect on wave drift forces since potential flow wave drift forces are related to waves generated by the structure care is needed in model tests to minimize tank wall interference second order slowly varying loads in irregular sea causing resonant surge sway and yaw must also be considered as it is done for moored floating offshore structures with spread mooring systems neither the latter effect nor the effect of current are studied in this paper although studies on sloshing and the coupled motions of ships are highly relevant for instance those by malenica et al 2003 rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 newman 2005 and kim et al 2007 there are still some differences between a ship and a closed cage for instance a ship normally possesses larger m t m l than the closed cage also a closed cage can be more flexible and hydroelasticity may matter with more modes relevant than those typically important for ships an experimental study on the wave induced responses of a closed flexible structure was performed by lader et al 2017 linear response of a 2d closed flexible fish cage in waves was investigated numerically by strand and faltinsen 2019 the motion of the membrane was represented as the sum of rigid body motions and fourier series with zero displacement at the attachment to the floater linear frequency domain potential flow theory of incompressible water was used both for the interior and external flows strong coupling between elastic modes and rigid body motions was observed the approach was extended to investigate linear wave induced dynamic structural stress of a 2d semi flexible closed fish cage by strand and faltinsen 2020 they compared a quasi static analysis with a fully coupled hydroelastic analysis to examine the soundness of assuming that the stresses in the structure are quasi static and concluded that whether a hydroelastic analysis is necessary depending to the stiffness of the structure kristiansen et al 2018 presented scaled physical experiments of a floating rigid closed cage model in waves two model configurations were tested to investigate the coupling effects of the contained water on the rigid body motions one with the model filled with water and one with the contained water replaced by fixed weights the results showed that the influence of sloshing on the rigid body motion was significant mean wave loads were also affected by sloshing the tests were performed in a towing tank and wave reflections from the side tank walls were found to have large influence on the mean wave drift force this phenomenon was also illustrated by zhao et al 1988 who presented experimental results and theoretical analysis for a hemisphere in a conventional towing tank at zero and small forward speed more recently 14 investigated numerically the liquid sloshing problem in an upright circular tank under periodic and transient excitations a fully nonlinear time domain harmonic polynomial cell hpc method based on overset mesh was developed to delve into the flow physics in the present paper we present results from model tests of a froude scaled closed cage in regular and truncated white noise waves the tests were conducted in a large ocean basin to minimize the disturbances from side wall reflections and served as a follow up of the experiments performed by kristiansen et al 2018 the paper is organized as follows a description of the experimental set up is given at first next the technique to post process the experimental data including extracting rigid body motions and elastic deformations is explained in the last part relevant experimental results are given and analyzed the focus is on the transfer functions of rigid body motions radial elastic deformations internal sloshing and mean wave drift forces numerical results from a linear potential flow solver wamit are also provided for comparison the effect of hydroelasticity is studied by coupling wamit with the structural analysis software ls dyna hallquist 2007 furthermore parametric pitch resonance is discussed 2 experimental setup model tests were performed in the ocean basin laboratory at the marine technology center in trondheim the basin has an overall length of 80 m and width of 50 m the depth can vary between 0 10 m by an adjustable floor and was set to 5 m all values presented hereafter are in model scale unless otherwise noted the physical model used in the experiments included a vertical cylindrical closed cage moored by four horizontal mooring lines as shown in fig 1 a model test scale ratio of 1 27 and froude scaling with geometric similarity was in mind two cartesian right handed coordinate systems were implemented in the model tests one global system o x y z referred to the basin and one local system fixed to the model the origin of the former is in the plane of undisturbed free surface with vertical z axis positive upwards through the center of the cage in calm water and positive x towards the wavemaker the center of the model was located at the basin center when at rest the local body fixed coordinate system coincides with the global coordinate system in still water details of the system including the cage model the mooring lines and the arrangement of the various measurement instruments are introduced below 2 1 cage model description photo of the cage model from the front camera is presented in the left of fig 1 a sketch of the model and detailed dimensions are illustrated in fig 2 the model contained a vertical circular cylinder with draft h 0 75 m and outer diameter d 2 r 1 5 m the side wall of the cylindrical cage was made of polycarbonate resin lexan with thickness t c 5 mm the resulting diameter of the internal tank becomes d t 2 r t 1 49 m the tank bottom contains two layers a round pvc disk on top to prevent leakage of internal fluid and an divinycell plate below to add buoyancy both having a thickness of 10 mm leading to a tank depth h t 0 73 m a semi submerged torus shaped floating collar was attached to the outside of the cylindrical cage providing additional static stability and buoyancy the floating collar was made of plastic electrical tube with cross sectional diameter d f 0 05 m two massive aluminum rings were added above and below the floating collar to reduce the flexibility of the cage each with a cross sectional diameter of 20 mm three groups of vertical aluminum plates both inside and outside of the tank were used to connect the polycarbonate plate with 120 degrees between each two perpendicular steel square tubes were installed exterior to the cage bottom to reduce the deformation of the bottom plates the positions of the vertical aluminum plates and bottom steel tubes relative to the incident wave are illustrated in fig 3 showing an asymmetry of the model with respect to the x z plane the freeboard of the model was increased to h u 0 35 m to prevent spilling of water in high pitch roll motions by gluing two polycarbonate plates with an horizontal curved aluminum plate the main particulars of the model are given in table 1 the metacentric height given in the table is defined as g m c 55 ρ g with c 55 ρ g the restoring coefficient for pitch motion density of fresh water gravitational acceleration and water displacement of the model respectively c 55 is evaluated see faltinsen and timokha 2009 as 1 c 55 ρ g z b m g z g m l g z g l ρ g a w c x 2 d s ρ g a w f x 2 d s ρ g a w l x 2 d s where m is the mass of the dry model dry cage floating collar z g and z b are the corresponding center of gravity cog and center of buoyancy cob respectively m l is the mass of internal water and z g l h t 2 is the corresponding center of gravity a w c a w f and a w l are the waterplane area of the dry cage floating collar and internal water respectively the main reason for positive c 55 comes from the second last term i e the restoring provided by the floating collar the sum of the other terms equals approximately zero indicating that the model is not statically stable without the floating collar 2 2 mooring system description the cage model was moored with four mooring lines in the horizontal plane evenly distributed with 90 between each see fig 1 each of the four mooring lines was attached far away directly to horizontal free hanging coil springs the far away ends of the front two mooring lines l1 and l4 in fig 1 were elevated 1 m above the calm water surface while the aft two lines l2 and l3 in fig 1 were elevated to 0 6 m to avoid contact with water and disturbance of waves during the tests the stiffness of each coil spring was 60 n m yielding an equivalent stiffness k s 169 7 n m in x and in y directions for the system tension in each mooring line was measured by an uni axial load cell that connected the mooring line to the cage a pretension of f p r e 45 n was applied to all mooring lines to avoid them going slack during testing since the mooring lines considered are quite long approximately 33 m each the small height difference in the far away ends will cause a negligible static pitch the pretension in the mooring lines nevertheless will provide an additional equivalent pitch restoring coefficient c 55 p expressed as c 55 p f p r e d the restoring coefficient for pitch in eq 1 is corrected by accounting for also the contribution of the mooring lines the natural periods caused by the mooring system in surge and sway are much larger than our examined wave period range and have therefore negligible effect on our studied steady state response in regular waves 2 3 instrumentation the parameters of interest were global body motions internal sloshing and mooring loads the motions were measured using an optical positioning system qualisys oqus where the position of markers mounted on the model was tracked from camera images eight markers pos1 8 in fig 1 were installed along the perimeter of the cage model at freeboard level i e h u 0 35 m such that also eventual flexible radial deformations of the cage could be detected the accuracy of the motion measured by each individual marker was 0 2 mm this means a relative error of 0 02 in the experimental transfer functions when the incident wave amplitude is 1 cm the marker positions with respect to the positive x axis are provided in the left subtable of table 2 a set of three markers was also installed for 6 degree of freedom rigid body motions tracking see the white box installed at the freeboard of the cage in the left of fig 1 the rigid body motions measured with the three markers may be biased if the cage experiences elastic vibrations as the setup cannot distinguish the rigid motions from elastic vibrations wave induced accelerations of the model were measured by three accelerometers mounted on the cage side wall and could serve as a benchmark check of the measured motions from the markers detailed arrangement of the markers and accelerometers is illustrated in the right of fig 1 the model was also fitted with pairs of internal and external conventional wave probes distributed radially at eight positions along the side wall with a radial distance 0 05 r from the cage wall this means that the local wave elevation at the tank was measured in the body fixed reference frame sloshing of the contained water inside the cage model was measured by the internal eight wave probes rw1 8 while the wave elevation outside was captured by the external eight wave probes rw9 16 the wave gauge positions with respect to the positive x axis are provided in the right subtable of table 2 two more wave probes were installed 5 m away from the model to measure the front and side wave field named wave1 and wave3 in fig 1 prior to testing the wave field was calibrated without the presence of the model and an additional wave probe denoted wave2 was installed at the center position of the model all data acquisition was performed with a sampling frequency of 200 hz filtering of measured data was performed using an anti aliasing filter at 50 hz tests were recorded by three video cameras front top and side above the water surface and one camera under the water surface 2 4 test conditions the model was tested in regular waves and truncated white noise waves the regular wave tests were performed at a fixed wave steepness h λ 1 60 with h as the wave height and λ as the wave length in total 24 wave periods were considered varying from 0 6 s and 1 7 s it means that the corresponding wavelength to diameter ratio λ d changes from 0 38 to 3 0 the full scale wave height was within 0 25 m 2 03 m covering the sea conditions from small exposure to heavy exposure according to the norwegian aquaculture site classification shown in table 3 one more test with t 2 5 s and h 0 163 m was also conducted to examine the response of the cage in high exposure sea state a series of additional tests were performed at higher wave steepness h λ 1 45 the regular wave tests were performed to obtain approximately 2 3 min 12 min full scale data in addition two series of truncated white noise tests were executed to obtain continuous transfer functions within a given frequency region the term truncated white noise is used to describe a band limited white noise spectrum i e a square spectrum with nearly equal energy for all frequencies within the upper and lower bounds and with zero energy outside the bounds in the tests the lower and upper period region were 0 577 s 3 s full scale and 3 85 s 20 s full scale and two significant wave heights were considered in particular h s 0 037 m 1 m full scale and 0 074 m 2 m full scale hereafter the truncated white noise tests will be mentioned as white noise tests the white noise tests were conducted to obtain a 34 6 min 3 h full scale realization of the spectrum 2 5 decay tests free decay tests were carried out in surge heave and pitch to estimate the damping ratios and natural periods of these free motions the tests were started by giving the model an initial perturbation from equilibrium in the considered mode of motion trying to minimize the coupling with other modes from the free decays the natural period of surge heave and pitch are t n 1 22 4 s 116 4 s full scale t n 3 2 12 s 11 s full scale t n 5 2 76 s 14 36 s full scale respectively the free surface inside the tank can be approximated as horizontal at these frequencies and surge and pitch can as a first approximation be considered as uncoupled because it takes a long transient phase with given forcing frequency to develop steady state interior waves sloshing these tests do not provide information about coupled natural period between surge pitch and sloshing to be discussed below 2 6 resonance conditions for internal sloshing in order to analyze the effects of sloshing phenomena inside the cage we need to identify the occurrence and features of internal water resonance and therefore the sloshing natural frequencies and modes natural modes are nontrivial solutions to the linear boundary value problem for the water in the partially filled cage without external cage excitation according to faltinsen and timokha 2009 the velocity potential of liquid motion inside an upright circular cylindrical tank can be expressed in a cylindrical coordinate system o r θ z as 2 φ m n r θ z j m k m n r cosh k m n z h t cosh k m n h t cos m θ sin m θ where j m is the bessel function of the first kind of order m and h t is the tank water depth furthermore θ is defined in the right of fig 1 k m n l m n r t with r t the tank radius and l m n the non dimensional roots of the equation j m l m n 0 symbol prime indicates derivative of the function and m 0 1 2 n 1 2 3 both cos m θ and sin m θ modes can be excited given k m n the natural periods t m n corresponding to the different sloshing modes can be determined as 3 t m n 2 π g k m n tanh k m n h t the surface wave patterns of the normal modes can be found as f m n r θ φ m n r θ 0 and the sloshing mode shapes for m 0 1 2 3 and n 1 2 eight modes are presented in fig 4 3 signal processing in this section we will first introduce the approach to extract rigid body motions and radial elastic deformations from the measured translatory displacements of eight markers installed at the freeboard of the cage then the procedure to identify excitation of the sloshing modes from the internal eight wave probes is explained in regular waves steady state responses are of interest and the method to estimate the steady state amplitude and phase from the measured time series is also illustrated in the last part a brief explanation is given concerning the evaluation of transfer functions from the white noise tests 3 1 motion measurement as mentioned in section 2 3 two approaches were implemented to capture the motions of the cage i e using eight markers along the cage wall and using a three markers system the three markers system can be used to track the 6 dof linear rigid body motions for cases with negligible cage deformations while by manipulating the translatory motions of eight markers we can obtain both the rigid body motions and radial elastic deformations detailed explanation of the approach is given below according to linear theory the translatory motions s i of the i t h marker can be related to the body motions of the cage model as 4 s η 1 3 η 4 6 r d r where η 1 3 and η 4 6 are the three dimensional vectors of translatory and rotational rigid body modes of motion respectively while r is the position vector of the marker relative to the origin when at rest the additional term d r is included to account for possible deformations of the cage for the markers installed along the perimeter of the cage model with a given elevation z we will also operate with a cylindrical coordinate system o r θ z where x r cos θ y r sin θ z z eq 4 can be further expressed as 5 s s 1 i s 2 j s 3 k η 1 z η 5 y η 6 i η 2 z η 4 x η 6 j η 3 y η 4 x η 5 k d r η 1 z η 5 r sin θ η 6 i η 2 z η 4 r cos θ η 6 j η 3 r sin θ η 4 r cos θ η 5 k d r to account for the deformation in the radial direction at a given vertical position z and radial distance r r alternatively we can express the radial displacements as the following fourier series in θ 6 η r z t s n m 0 η r 1 m cos m θ m 1 η r 2 m sin m θ where n cos θ sin θ 0 and t is time this second approach will be pursued in the following in eq 6 η r 1 1 cos θ and η r 2 1 sin θ are local normal component due to rigid body surge and sway at level z respectively this can be expressed as η 1 z η 5 cos θ and η 2 z η 4 sin θ respectively this leads to η r 1 1 η 1 z η 5 and η r 2 1 η 2 z η 4 the contributions η r 1 2 cos 2 θ and η r 2 2 sin 2 θ are radial elastic ovalizing modes at level z as illustrated in fig 5 actually the displacements in vertical direction along the cage can also be expressed as a fourier series similar as done in radial direction but the deformations in vertical direction are expected to be small therefore to reduce complexity we just consider rigid body motions and the vertical translatory motion is expressed as 7 η z z t s 3 η 3 r sin θ η 4 r cos θ η 5 we will first show the procedure to obtain η 3 and η 5 eq 7 is projected along cos n θ it means that both sides are multiplied by cos n θ n 0 1 2 etc then it is integrated in θ between 0 and 2 π this gives 8 0 2 π s 3 cos n θ d θ 0 2 π η 3 r sin θ η 4 r cos θ η 5 cos n θ d θ s 3 is translatory motion in z direction and is a function of θ it can be obtained by implementing cubic spline interpolation in θ from the measured vertical displacements of the eight markers using the property of orthogonal functions the right side of eq 8 equals 2 π η 3 when n 0 if n 1 the value becomes π r η 5 similarly projecting eq 6 along cos n θ n 0 1 2 etc we can estimate coefficients η r 1 m for cos m θ modes known η r 1 1 and η 5 the rigid body surge motion can be readily obtained the same procedure is followed to obtain the sin m θ related terms in regular waves the linear steady state responses oscillating with incident wave frequency ω are of interest for instance the steady state radial displacements are expressed as 9 η r s z t m 0 η r a 1 m cos ω t ε r a 1 m cos m θ m 0 η r a 2 m cos ω t ε r a 2 m sin m θ here η r s is the linear steady state part of η r η r a j m and ε r a j m with j 1 2 are the corresponding amplitude and phase of cos m θ and sin m θ contributions respectively the phases are relative to the incident waves which are described by 10 ζ ζ a cos ω t k x where ζ a is the incident wave amplitude and k is the wave number for all examined tests k satisfies the deep water dispersion relationship i e k ω 2 g 3 2 internal wave elevation the wave elevations are measured relative to the tank fixed coordinate system to relate the internal wave with the natural sloshing modes fourier modes in θ for the internal waves are extracted based on the measurements from eight internal wave probes rw1 8 the free surface level inside the container at a given radial distance r 0 95 r is expressed as 11 ζ i n t t m 0 ζ 1 m cos m θ m 1 ζ 2 m sin m θ employing the same strategy as done in section 3 1 we can have the coefficients ζ 1 m and ζ 2 m for cos m θ and sin m θ modes respectively in regular waves the corresponding steady state linear free surface level is expressed as 12 ζ i n t s t m 0 ζ a 1 m cos ω t ε a 1 m cos m θ m 1 ζ a 2 m cos ω t ε a 2 m sin m θ here ζ i n t s is the linear steady state part of ζ i n t ζ a j m and ε a j m with j 1 2 are the corresponding amplitude and phase of cos m θ and sin m θ modes respectively 3 3 transfer function in regular waves the incident waves can be considered as deep water waves for illustration a typical time history of surge motion in regular wave is shown in the left plot of fig 6 the considered incident wave period and height are respectively t 1 02 s and h 0 027 m there is clearly a beating component with period of about 22 4 s this is the natural surge period of the system consisting of mooring lines and the cage longer time is needed to damp out this slowly varying component due to the small associated damping to estimate the steady state response and phase a time interval is extracted where the system is considered to have reached steady state the start time of this window is evaluated as t s t p t r a m p here t p l d c p is the time needed by the wave front for the considered regular wave to travel from the wavemaker to the model center position by assuming linear wave theory l d is the distance between the wavemaker and the model and c p is the wave group velocity t r a m p 35 t is used to remove the start up transient stage as illustrated in the right of fig 6 the end time is chosen as 0 95 t t o t with t t o t the length of the measured time series two strategies are adopted to evaluate the corresponding amplitude and phase of the response variable of interest the first is applying the fast fourier transform fft for the considered steady state interval then the amplitude and phase for the first harmonic component can be easily obtained the time series is tapered at both ends by means of a bingham window harris 1978 to reduce end effects of the extracted time interval the main shortcoming of this method is the unavailability of error bar of the amplitude which may serve as an indication of whether steady state is achieved alternatively we attempt to extract the response component oscillating with ω using band pass filtering only signal with frequency equal to ω is kept a gaussian mask hansen 2014 is multiplied to the signal frequency spectrum obtained by fourier transform fft the derived time history and the related envelope are shown in the right plot of fig 6 similar as in the first method a steady state time window is chosen and the hilbert transform oppenheim et al 2001 is used for calculating instantaneous properties of the resulting time series eventually the mean values representing the amplitude of the measurements and the standard deviations of the envelope curves are obtained the phase relative to the incident wave can be easily obtained by calculating the time offset δ t of zero up crossing between the two time series the response and the incident wave signals and estimated as 2 π δ t t the latter method is used for further analysis of transfer functions of the measured variables 3 4 transfer function in irregular waves for white noise tests transfer functions can be estimated in two ways using power spectral density psd and cross power spectral density cpsd of the incident wave and the measured variables bendat and piersol 2011 to evaluate the relevant spectra the signal is chopped into time windows in each of them a fourier transform is applied to determine its frequency components the predictions made in these time windows are then averaged to produce the estimated spectra welch 1967 as an example the transfer function of surge motion is given as 13 h η 1 η 1 s η 1 η 1 s ζ ζ or h η 1 ζ s η 1 ζ s ζ ζ where h η 1 η 1 is the response amplitude operator for surge from psd s η 1 η 1 is the power spectrum of surge motion and s ζ ζ the power spectrum of incident wave h η 1 ζ is the complex response operator for surge from cpsd including both amplitude and phase information s η 1 ζ is the cross power spectrum between surge motion and incident wave and is a complex variable a comparison of the response amplitude operator of surge motion from the two methods is presented in fig 7 versus incident wavelength to diameter ratio λ d the two methods yield similar results for shorter waves where the system is expected to behave more like a linear system larger difference is observed for longer waves i e involving periods larger than the relevant sloshing natural periods this suggests more pronounced nonlinear effects in surge as a consequence of its coupling with pitch in fact longer waves can induce stronger nonlinearities in pitch due to possible in and out of water on the floating collar this explanation is supported by later fig 13 where the linear potential flow solver wamit provides a poor prediction for pitch in longer waves since both the amplitude and phase information are of interest the method based on cpsd will be further adopted to calculate the transfer functions for the measured variables 4 experimental results and discussions in this section we show and discuss selected results from the model tests for the closed cage firstly the experimental accuracy in the generation of prescribed regular and white noise waves is assessed then transfer functions of the measured variables are shown finally the mean wave drift forces acting on the cage are examined results from the linear potential flow solver wamit lee 1995 are also provided assuming a rigid structure the sloshing part was verified by comparing with analytical expressions for surge and pitch added mass presented by faltinsen and timokha 2009 hydroelasticity was studied by combining wamit with ls dyna hallquist 2007 4 1 incident waves in order to quantify the experimental reliability in generating the prescribed waves preliminary wave propagation tests were performed with no model present in the wave basin an example of incident regular wave time history is given in the left plot of fig 8 with prescribed period and height respectively t 1 02 s and h 0 027 m to estimate the actual incident wave height the strategy described in section 3 3 is implemented and only the first harmonic component is considered the averaged wave height becomes 0 0246 m about 9 smaller than the prescribed value a more detailed comparison between the experimental and theoretical wave heights is shown in the right of fig 8 the generated incident waves at the model location were found to be in good agreement with the prescribed regular wave parameters for shorter waves but larger deviations were observed for longer waves tests with incident waves generated according to the truncated white noise spectrum with and without the model were also performed an example of incident white noise wave time history is provided in the left of fig 9 the prescribed significant wave height is h s 0 037 m and the frequency region with energy is between 0 208 hz and 1 732 hz the corresponding λ d changes between 0 346 and 15 42 theoretically the waves should have equal energy within the prescribed frequency region as shown by the red dashed line in the right of the plot of the figure the actual spectral density varies but with mean value close to the theoretical value the actual measured incident wave parameters will be used when evaluating the transfer functions however for convenience the prescribed incident wave parameters will be used in the figures captions and in the main text 4 2 transfer function of rigid cage motions as mentioned in section 2 3 the motions of the cage were measured with two methods either using the eight markers along the cage wall or obtained directly from the three markers system the former can provide both rigid motions and radial elastic deformations of the cage while the latter can provide 6 dof rigid body motions directly and is only applicable for bodies acting as fully rigid fig 10 shows the time histories of the surge heave and pitch motions obtained from the two methods for the case with t 2 5 s h 0 163 m and h λ 1 60 corresponding to λ d 6 5 the cage is expected to have negligible deformations for the examined case as it will tend to follow the waves so the three markers system could provide reliable rigid body motions the figure confirms that the two measurement techniques give consistent results showing the reliability of extracting the rigid and elastic body motions from the eight markers things change when the wavelength is not large compared to the cage diameter this is shown by the case with t 1 02 s h 0 027 m and h λ 1 60 corresponding to λ d 1 08 the time histories of the rigid body motions are shown in fig 11 the two measurements provide similar results at the initial stage but after about 70 periods larger difference is observed when the waves inside the cage become high in time and large ovalizing structural modes are excited the main reason for the difference is that the three markers system in principle cannot be applied for tests with non negligible body deformations as the rigid body motions cannot be separated from the elastic deformations a more detailed comparison of the rigid body motions from the two measurements for different wave periods is shown in fig 12 from the figure the two approaches provide consistent results for surge and heave motions in long waves λ d 1 6 larger differences are observed for all the three examined motions in short waves λ d 1 5 especially for wave periods close to the sloshing natural period t 21 where the cage experiences large ovalization deformations the rigid body motions from the eight markers will be used for further analysis fig 13 shows the comparisons for surge heave and pitch in a frequency range of primary importance for local wind generated waves experimental data from both regular waves and the two white noise tests are given results from the linear potential flow solver wamit are also provided motion amplitudes from regular waves in general agree nicely with those from the white noise tests especially when the latter is with smaller significant wave height i e h s 1 27 m the wave periods examined are far from the relevant rigid body natural periods without coupling to sloshing results from the two white noise tests match well for shorter waves λ d 1 5 but larger differences are observed for longer waves where the system is characterized by stronger nonlinearities as discussed later these may involve in general both potential flow and viscous flow effects with the latter connected with flow separation however calculations with an equivalent linearized damping corresponding to 10 of the critical damping were also performed by wamit not shown here to check the effect of viscous damping and small influence was observed for λ d 4 as a note the longer waves examined here correspond to periods still far from the natural pitch period important sloshing natural periods t 11 1 313 s t 21 0 996 s and t 12 0 753 s in model scale are denoted with vertical dashed lines in the figure surface wave pattern of the three sloshing modes are exemplified in fig 4 we should note that nearly zero surge is happening at λ d 1 794 corresponding to t t 11 which is consistent with linear sloshing theory when surge is uncoupled from pitch a coupled sloshing surge pitch natural period occurs according to linear theory at λ d 1 162 where we see a clear peak in theoretical and experimental results of surge and pitch it should be pointed out that λ d 1 03 corresponds to t t 21 the latter fact and closeness to the peak value at λ d 1 162 together with the fact that violent sloshing occurs must not be misinterpreted as sloshing resonance associated with t 21 resonant oscillations associated with t 21 cannot be excited according to linear theory for a rigid structure there is overall a good comparison between wamit and the experimental surge heave and pitch transfer functions however we note some differences for pitch for λ d 1 4 one reason can be large relative vertical motions at the floating collar causing nonlinearities of more importance for pitch than for surge and heave this can be directly seen by examining the restoring coefficients and the froude kriloff excitation loads which partly can be associated with the relative vertical wave elevation at the floater the measured relative wave elevation outside the cage is shown in fig 14 for the regular wave cases with steepness h λ 1 60 peaks and absolute values of troughs of the wave elevations from the three wave probes rw9 rw11 and rw13 defined in fig 1 are included the values are made nondimensional by the cross sectional radius of the floating collar r f the figure shows that the relative wave height in the front wave probe rw9 is apparently larger than in the side rw11 and back rw13 probes for cases with λ d 1 4 the nondimensional relative wave amplitude is larger than 1 implying that the front part of the floating collar will go in and out of the water this coincides with the region where wamit provides poor prediction of the pitch motion the large relative vertical motions suggest that flow separations occur we can make the analogy of ambient one dimensional oscillating flow past a 2d circular cylinder in infinite fluid and introduce the keulegan carpenter number kc π ζ r e l a r f the flow separates from the analogue cylinder when kc 2 comparisons of the phase of the motions from the experiments and from wamit calculations are presented in fig 15 the values from the regular wave tests and white noise tests are consistent which demonstrates the feasibility of performing white noise tests to obtain the transfer functions also reasonable good agreement between the numerical and experimental results is obtained this is consistent with the discussion in section 1 concerning the fact that the sloshing response can be mild if the coupled natural frequency ω coupl 1 is not close to the natural sloshing frequency ω 1 in fact in this case ω coupl 1 ω 1 1 25 and a linear potential solver can provide reasonable predictions one needs to point out that the results from the regular wave tests show a jump in the surge from value close to 180 to approximately 180 near λ d 1 see left of fig 15 this is connected with the analysis used to estimate the phase angle defined between 180 and 180 we could manually change the sign of the phase in order to avoid the jump but we preferred to leave the results as obtained from the analysis in any case this does not affect the actual complex transfer function response amplitude operators for λ d 3 7 are also presented to examine the behavior of the system in long waves see fig 16 wamit predicts a coupled surge pitch natural period corresponding to λ d 7 6 since the wave radiation damping is very small large resonant values are predicted the white noise tests with lower wave amplitude indicate mild peaks in surge and pitch at slightly larger λ d while the tests at larger wave amplitude do not document clear peaks in this wavelength region this suggests an importance of nonlinear viscous and potential flow effects in the tests since these nonlinearities are not so important for instance for the heave restoring coefficient wamit documents a reasonable agreement with experimental resonant heave values to understand better the wave body interaction close to the resonance zone we can examine the corresponding regular wave case a regular wave test with t 2 5 s corresponding to λ d 6 5 was performed with h 0 163 m and the time histories of motions are shown in fig 10 the heave motion transfer function from regular wave test matches with the white noise value but this is not the case for the surge and pitch especially for the pitch a so called mathieu type instability occurred for the pitch motion for the regular wave case due to in and out of water of the floating collar as a consequence of large heave motion and heave pitch coupling see snapshots shown in fig 17 mathieu type of instability is well known for parametric roll of ship ghamari et al 2020 and for buoys haslum and faltinsen 1999 the pitch motion comprises two harmonic components oscillating with t and 2 t respectively the corresponding time histories are shown in the left plot of fig 18 the subharmonic 2 t is the one connected with the pitch instability becoming dominant as time goes on and cannot be predicted by linear potential theory the metacentric height gm c 55 ρ g with c 55 given in eq 1 is modified by a quasistatic formulation where the effect of heave and incident wave is accounted for it means that ρ g a w f x 2 d s is modified by considering measured relative vertical elevations at the floating collar as presented in fig 14 furthermore ρ g z b is modified by accounting for the relative vertical motions the time history of gm is shown in the right of fig 18 from the figure we note that gm has a constant term gm m plus a time dependent term the dominant component of the latter follows δ gm cos ω gm t ε gm with δ gm ω gm and ε gm the corresponding oscillation amplitude frequency and phase respectively the pitch behavior can be explained by introducing mathieu equation the mathieu equation follows by setting up the uncoupled pitch equation with zero excitation and is given as 14 i 55 a 55 η 5 ρ g gm m 1 δ gm gm m cos ω gm t ε gm η 5 0 here i 55 and a 55 are the inertia moment and added mass for the pitch motion respectively the undamped natural frequency for pitch is expressed as ω n 5 ρ g gm m i 55 a 55 from fig 18 the new mean metacentric height gm m 0 32 gm m 0 with gm m 0 the initial metacentric height in calm water this leads to the change of ω n 5 from 0 427 rad s to 0 244 rad s the time dependent term oscillates with frequency ω gm ω 0 483 rad s and amplitude δ gm 5 37 gm m fig 19 shows the stability diagram for mathieu equation from klotter 2013 for the examined case ω n 5 ω 0 5 and δ gm gm m 5 37 corresponding to the red circle in the figure because in our case ξ ω n ω 0 0178 with ξ as the damping ratio between pitch radiation damping and the critical damping the mathieu instability will then be excited similar phenomenon was observed in an irregular wave test not discussed in detail in the present paper with peak wave period t p 1 924 s and significant wave height h s 0 11 m corresponding in full scale to the extreme sea state defined in table 3 the relevant power spectra for the incident wave heave and pitch motions are shown in fig 20 the peak pitch response occurs at wave period close to 2 t n 3 instead of at the natural pitch period t n 5 due to large resonant heave motion at t n 3 since our focus is on wave conditions associated with local wind generated waves more detailed discussions for the system in long waves and about the importance of accounting for system nonlinearity are left for future work high harmonic components of the rigid body motions from the regular waves tests are also analyzed and are generally moderate compared with the first harmonic value i e less than 10 4 3 transfer function of radial elastic deformations as explained in section 3 1 we can extract both rigid body motions and radial elastic deformations from the measurements of eight markers installed at the freeboard of the cage fig 21 presents the transfer functions of the ovalizing modes cos 2 θ and sin 2 θ of the fish cage at z 0 35 m from both the regular wave tests and white noise tests the fact that the ovalizing mode sin 2 θ occurs is partly a consequence of structural asymmetry the peak deformation occurs at λ d 1 078 t 1 018 s for both modes close to the corresponding sloshing natural period t 21 0 996 s we should note that the value is different from the coupled sloshing surge pitch natural period and is a consequence of coupling between structural ovalizing modes and corresponding sloshing modes results from the regular wave tests are in general consistent with those from the white noise tests except near the resonant zone the difference between the two white noise tests at the resonant frequency indicates the occurrence of free surface nonlinearities similar difference was observed between the results from the white noise tests and irregular wave tests not presented in the paper time histories of the ovalization modes from the regular wave test at the resonant period are shown in fig 22 two extra elastic modes are included the figure shows that the ovalizing modes dominate over other modes and due to small damping do not reach steady state within the time duration of the test the build up of the sin 2 θ mode is initially slower than for the cos 2 θ mode later on the values of the two ovalizing modes become similar in magnitude one reason may be coupling with nonlinear sloshing and associated transfer of energy as detailed studied by faltinsen and timokha 2009 for prescribed horizontal motion of a rigid vertical tank near the highest sloshing period due to unrealistic large error bar associated the corresponding regular wave values are not presented in fig 21 the fact that the sin 2 θ component is clearly smaller than the cos 2 θ component outside resonance is qualitatively consistent with the structural asymmetry introduced by the construction of the vertical cylinder and the cross bar exterior to the tank bottom see fig 2 the transfer functions of other elastic modes are small i e less than 2 so are not presented here the ratio between the wet and dry natural periods of the ovalizing modes is 9 a major reason is the influence of sloshing on the corresponding generalized added mass a numerical analysis of the ovalizing modes has been attempted by combining a fem software ls dyna hallquist 2007 with wamit the implemented fem structural model is based on the left of fig 2 with only shell elements used the aluminum rings with d 20 mm are approximated with plane shell elements of 15 5 mm to hit the first two experimentally obtained dry natural frequencies the presence of the thin plastic floater is neglected in the fem model the influence of the h60 divinycell is neglected as its tensile compressive modulus is significantly smaller than that of pvc the numerical model includes the hydroelastic response by including the structural modes calculated by eigen value analysis in absence of liquid here we have neglected the effect of water on the mode shapes added mass and damping terms for the flexible modes as well as their coupling with rigid modes are included in the total added mass and damping matrices hence the linear hydrodynamic coupling between rigid and flexible modes has been modeled the first two orthogonal modes are relevant for the ovalizing deformations and are used as generalized modes in wamit hence the matrices have a 8x8 dimension i e 6 rigid plus 2 flexible modes generalized mass and stiffness matrices from the eigen value analysis of the dry model are included in the equation system the modal shapes of the first two orthogonal modes are shown in fig 23 the predicted radial ovalizing deformations are presented in fig 21 the resonant frequencies in model tests are captured relatively well by the numerical model the response amplitudes are also well predicted except in the resonant region with an obvious overestimation a possible reason for the overestimation could be due to the free surface nonlinearities in the experiments the current numerical method in frequency domain is a practical approach for the initial design stage to have a good overview of the hydroelastic response of a fish cage in a wide frequency range with small computational cost however if nonlinear sloshing is present a time domain simulation approach must be considered in which free surface nonlinearity is adopted at least in the internal domain 4 4 transfer function of interior waves free surface elevation inside the container was measured by the eight interior wave probes rw1 8 see fig 1 the probes were installed as fixed to the cage so the measured values are related to the tank fixed coordinate system as an example transfer functions of the wave probes rw1 and rw4 are provided in fig 24 the two peaks close to t 12 and t 21 are associated with the corresponding natural sloshing modes in fact one should note that the coupling between sloshing and body motions affects the natural periods the maximum values occur at the same wave period as that of the ovalizing modes i e at λ d 1 078 the corresponding time histories of the wave elevation from the regular wave test are shown in fig 25 the figure clearly shows that the interior wave is still accumulating and more time than examined experimentally is needed to reach steady state this is similar as that shown in fig 22 for the elastic deformations also in this case it leads to unrealistic large error bars for the transfer functions not presented in fig 24 to better relate the interior wave elevation with sloshing modes the fourier components cos m θ and sin m θ of the internal waves are calculated at r 0 95 r based on the method explained in section 3 2 transfer functions of the first three cos m θ m 0 1 2 modes and the first two sin m θ m 1 2 modes are presented in fig 26 relevant sloshing natural periods for different modes are indicated by the vertical dashed lines there is only a cos θ component according to linear rigid body theory numerical prediction from wamit for cos θ mode is also provided and good agreement with the experimental results is observed especially for shorter waves λ d 1 5 the modes cos θ and sin θ are 90 out of phase at resonance which implies swirling however we note the dominant contribution of the cos 2 θ and sin 2 θ terms at resonance and the corresponding phase difference is 180 the phase difference is evaluated based on the approach introduced in section 3 3 the fact that the sin 2 θ mode occurs is associated with structural asymmetry and free surface nonlinearities the interior wave elevations associated with the ovalizing deformations are also evaluated based on the hydroelasticity analysis introduced in section 4 3 and are presented in the bottom of fig 26 similar as that for the ovalizing deformations the numerical tool can provide a reasonable prediction of the interior wave amplitudes but not in the resonant region with a clear overestimation at the resonant period 4 5 mean wave drift forces when interacting with the cage the incident waves will cause mean drift loads on the cage due to the far field waves generated by the structure the mean surge force is of particular interest as it is important for a mooring analysis two methods are pursued to estimate the mean wave drift force in surge 1 from tension measurement of the mooring lines 2 by multiplying the mean surge motion with the equivalent linear stiffness k s of the system documented in section 2 2 in the left plot of fig 27 we present the time histories of the surge force from the two methods for t 1 25 s h 0 041 m and λ d 1 628 the two strategies yield similar results when the cage is freely floating without incoming waves t 40 t a possible reason that the cage has nonzero surge motion in still water is that the time interval between two successive tests was not long enough to dampen out the slowly varying surge motion larger differences are observed for both the mean value and amplitude when the cage interacts with the incident waves the possible reasons for the differences are 1 the model was moored by four horizontal mooring lines which were attached directly to horizontal free hanging coil springs the length of the mooring lines was quite long about 33 m in model scale so the weight of the springs will influence the measured forces 2 videos from the tests show that part of the mooring lines got wet during the tests in waves 3 cage deformations would also influence the mooring loads however the large amplification of the cos 2 θ and sin 2 θ response at resonance see fig 21 indicates small wave radiation due to cage deformation and thereby small influence on the wave drift force in the right of fig 27 we shows the comparison of the mean surge forces from the regular wave tests with those from wamit irregular wave periods corresponding to eigenperiods for the interior problem with zero dirichlet condition on the body boundary condition are suppressed in wamit results the kink at λ d 0 58 is associated with the sloshing natural period t 12 as shown in fig 13 the experimental values are estimated by multiplying the mean surge motion with equivalent stiffness the evaluation based on the measurement of mooring forces was also performed but the obtained values were quite scattered so they are not shown the asymptotic value of f 1 ρ g ζ a 2 d is 1 3 for λ d 0 according to second order potential flow theory this is in good agreement with wamit 5 conclusions in this paper we presented a scaled experimental study of a closed floating cage in waves the tests were performed in an ocean basin to avoid possible reflections from side tank walls a main purpose was to investigate how sloshing would influence the global response of the cage the interior wave elevation and also the mean drift loads the model was tested in both regular waves and truncated white noise waves a focus was on the transfer functions in the wave period region associated with local wind generated waves the radial elastic deformations of the cage were extracted from the measurements of the eight markers installed on the freeboard and relatively large ovalizing radial deformations were observed for wave periods close to the natural sloshing period t 21 associated with the sloshing modes having a cos 2 θ and sin 2 θ dependence the fourier modes of the interior wave were also evaluated based on the wave elevations of the eight internal wave probes the cos 2 θ and sin 2 θ modes were found to be dominant and the resonance period coincided with that for the ovalizing radial deformations the above results imply that hydroelasticity matters and a non dimensional parameter involving young s modulus should be introduced to scale the model test results to full scale a rational numerical hydroelastic method can be a useful tool in the scaling and requires further studies numerical predictions from the linear potential flow solver wamit were also provided assuming a rigid body good agreements between the numerical and experimental results were obtained for both the rigid body motions and corresponding interior wave elevation actually linear potential flow theory can provide a good description of the interior sloshing if the structure is rigid and the coupled natural frequency between surge pitch and sloshing ω coupl 1 is not close to the lowest natural sloshing frequency ω 1 as it is the case in the present paper nice agreement was also achieved between the numerical predictions and experimental results for the mean drift forces despite large ovalizing radial modes involved it seems that the mean wave forces are not so influenced by the elastic deformations of the body and a reliable mooring force analysis can still be performed neglecting body elasticity a numerical analysis of the ovalizing modes was also attempted by combining the structural analysis program ls dyna with wamit the resonant frequencies in model tests were well captured in terms of the ovalizing deformations and interior waves the proposed numerical tool could provide reasonable predictions except in the resonant zone where the free surface nonlinearities may matter with a clear overestimation from the linear results in the present study a torus shaped floater was applied to increase the static stability of the cage in roll and pitch from the model tests the floating collar can easily go in and out water due to small draft causing parametric pitch instability in long waves and consequently large pitch motion to avoid such drawback a floater with much larger draft is suggested so to avoid a time dependent change of the restoring stiffness and consequently prevent instability credit authorship contribution statement yugao shen conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation writing

20362,wave induced response of a closed floating fish cage consisting of a vertical circular cylinder with an external toroidal floater is studied theoretically and experimentally a main purpose was to investigate how the internal sloshing would influence the global response of the cage the interior wave elevation and also the mean drift loads an ocean basin laboratory was used in order to minimize tank wall effects an optical system involving eight markers was used to obtain experimental values for radial elastic deformations of the cylindrical part the closer a coupled natural period between body motions and sloshing is to a corresponding natural sloshing period the more nonlinear sloshing can be in the examined case the highest coupled natural period between surge pitch and sloshing is 0 8 times the highest natural sloshing period linear potential flow theory can in general explain experimental transfer functions of rigid body motions and sloshing due to rigid body motions obtained by both regular wave and truncated white noise tests theoretical second order mean wave drift forces based on a rigid body and potential flow agree also well with experimental results resonant 3d sloshing was excited due to ovalizing hydroelastic structural modes in both regular waves and white noise tests the closeness between the corresponding structural and sloshing frequencies caused large response a linear hydroelastic analysis based on wamit and ls dyna could partly explain the response parametric resonant pitch response occurred experimentally at large wave periods partially due to in and out of water motion of portions of the floater and was explained by treating the pitch as uncoupled motion modeled by the mathieu equation the pitch motion predicted by linear potential flow theory was in general unsatisfactory when the floater was partly out of the water occasionally keywords global response mean drift forces hydroelasticity regular wave tests white noise tests 1 introduction there exists a variety of floating fish farms with net cages since salmon lice and pollution is of major concern closed fish farms have recently been proposed to have a better control over the internal water quality depending on the material closed fish cages can be divided into flexible membrane cages e g fabric semiflexible elastic cages e g grp and rigid cages e g concrete or steel they have typically a vertical symmetry axis at rest with a circular shape in the waterplane examples on diameters in the water plane are 40 50 m a pump system is needed for water exchange in the tank and waste must be removed from the tank typical steady flow velocities caused by the pumping system are 0 2 0 4 m s since the water inside a closed tank causes statically destabilizing roll and pitch moments torus shaped floaters around the fish cage have been proposed the hydrodynamic flow associated with closed fish cages differs strongly from net cages potential flow effects with wave generation caused by the cage dominate for closed fish cages while viscous flow is dominant for net cages this has consequences both for the wave induced response and mooring system analysis wave induced sloshing interior resonant wave motion becomes an issue in closed fish cages as well known in many engineering applications faltinsen and timokha 2009 lateral tank excitations involving the lowest natural sloshing frequency is of primary sloshing concern for a rigid tank when the lateral tank motion is prescribed and harmonic the liquid motion at the lowest natural sloshing frequencies can dependent on the excitation level be strongly nonlinear free surface nonlinearities can develop three dimensional 3d liquid motion for instance forced horizontal motion of a vertical circular tank in the vicinity of the lowest sloshing frequency can cause swirling or irregular chaotic 3d motions that depend on the forcing amplitude and the liquid depth the interior wave motion becomes secondary for larger wavelength to diameter ratio however it matters for roll and pitch that the interior free surface will then remain nearly horizontal when the tank is part of a structure moving in incident waves the sloshing behavior differs from that induced by prescribed tank motion for instance if a rigid body with a tank is restrained to only move in surge the body amplitude will according to linear theory and steady state conditions be zero when the wave frequency is equal to a natural sloshing frequency ω 2 i 1 i 1 2 associated with antisymmetric natural sloshing modes the latter is a consequence of that the magnitude of the surge added mass a 11 s l o s h associated with sloshing is infinite at the natural sloshing frequencies in the case of coupled surge sloshing system the maximum response is associated with coupled surge sloshing natural frequencies ω coupl 2 i 1 the latter are solutions of the equation m t m l a 11 s l o s h ω 0 when the surge restoring force is negligible here m t is the sum of the body mass and surge added mass associated with the external flow furthermore m l is the liquid mass in the tank the reason for the coupled surge sloshing frequencies ω coupl 2 i 1 is the negative values of a 11 s l o s h which can be expressed as an infinite sum where each term is a positive constant times 1 ω 2 i 1 2 ω 2 it means that a 11 s l o s h can be positive or negative depending on the frequency the consequence is e g that ω coupl 1 ω 1 if the coupled natural frequency ω coupl 1 is very close to the natural sloshing frequency ω 1 the sloshing response can be violent faltinsen and timokha 2021 studied this problem systematically for a body with a rectangular tank in 2d flow conditions and compared with model tests by rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 they introduced the ratio m t m l as a parameter they found that ω coupl 1 ω 1 increased with decreasing m t m l and liquid depth to tank breadth ratio and that ω coupl 1 ω 1 tended to 1 without reaching 1 with increasing m t m l and liquid depth to tank breadth ratio we can generalize these findings by studying the response in the vicinity of any natural sloshing frequency and incorporating any relevant body motions in finding the coupled natural frequency for a rigid body this means either surge and pitch or sway roll and yaw rigid body heave cannot excite sloshing according to linear theory the fact that a closed fish cage can be flexible and has a vertical symmetry axis at rest introduces in particular concern for the lowest natural sloshing frequency with an ovalizing radial mode shape while nonlinearities may matter for sloshing the exterior potential flow can in many cases be based on linear potential flow theory of incompressible water for instance by shen et al 2020 corrections due to viscous flow separation may matter as damping wave drift forces are needed for the mooring analysis which can be based on a second order potential flow analysis for the exterior flow problem the coupled effect of interior water behavior on the body motions must be accounted for current can have a non negligible effect on wave drift forces since potential flow wave drift forces are related to waves generated by the structure care is needed in model tests to minimize tank wall interference second order slowly varying loads in irregular sea causing resonant surge sway and yaw must also be considered as it is done for moored floating offshore structures with spread mooring systems neither the latter effect nor the effect of current are studied in this paper although studies on sloshing and the coupled motions of ships are highly relevant for instance those by malenica et al 2003 rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 newman 2005 and kim et al 2007 there are still some differences between a ship and a closed cage for instance a ship normally possesses larger m t m l than the closed cage also a closed cage can be more flexible and hydroelasticity may matter with more modes relevant than those typically important for ships an experimental study on the wave induced responses of a closed flexible structure was performed by lader et al 2017 linear response of a 2d closed flexible fish cage in waves was investigated numerically by strand and faltinsen 2019 the motion of the membrane was represented as the sum of rigid body motions and fourier series with zero displacement at the attachment to the floater linear frequency domain potential flow theory of incompressible water was used both for the interior and external flows strong coupling between elastic modes and rigid body motions was observed the approach was extended to investigate linear wave induced dynamic structural stress of a 2d semi flexible closed fish cage by strand and faltinsen 2020 they compared a quasi static analysis with a fully coupled hydroelastic analysis to examine the soundness of assuming that the stresses in the structure are quasi static and concluded that whether a hydroelastic analysis is necessary depending to the stiffness of the structure kristiansen et al 2018 presented scaled physical experiments of a floating rigid closed cage model in waves two model configurations were tested to investigate the coupling effects of the contained water on the rigid body motions one with the model filled with water and one with the contained water replaced by fixed weights the results showed that the influence of sloshing on the rigid body motion was significant mean wave loads were also affected by sloshing the tests were performed in a towing tank and wave reflections from the side tank walls were found to have large influence on the mean wave drift force this phenomenon was also illustrated by zhao et al 1988 who presented experimental results and theoretical analysis for a hemisphere in a conventional towing tank at zero and small forward speed more recently 14 investigated numerically the liquid sloshing problem in an upright circular tank under periodic and transient excitations a fully nonlinear time domain harmonic polynomial cell hpc method based on overset mesh was developed to delve into the flow physics in the present paper we present results from model tests of a froude scaled closed cage in regular and truncated white noise waves the tests were conducted in a large ocean basin to minimize the disturbances from side wall reflections and served as a follow up of the experiments performed by kristiansen et al 2018 the paper is organized as follows a description of the experimental set up is given at first next the technique to post process the experimental data including extracting rigid body motions and elastic deformations is explained in the last part relevant experimental results are given and analyzed the focus is on the transfer functions of rigid body motions radial elastic deformations internal sloshing and mean wave drift forces numerical results from a linear potential flow solver wamit are also provided for comparison the effect of hydroelasticity is studied by coupling wamit with the structural analysis software ls dyna hallquist 2007 furthermore parametric pitch resonance is discussed 2 experimental setup model tests were performed in the ocean basin laboratory at the marine technology center in trondheim the basin has an overall length of 80 m and width of 50 m the depth can vary between 0 10 m by an adjustable floor and was set to 5 m all values presented hereafter are in model scale unless otherwise noted the physical model used in the experiments included a vertical cylindrical closed cage moored by four horizontal mooring lines as shown in fig 1 a model test scale ratio of 1 27 and froude scaling with geometric similarity was in mind two cartesian right handed coordinate systems were implemented in the model tests one global system o x y z referred to the basin and one local system fixed to the model the origin of the former is in the plane of undisturbed free surface with vertical z axis positive upwards through the center of the cage in calm water and positive x towards the wavemaker the center of the model was located at the basin center when at rest the local body fixed coordinate system coincides with the global coordinate system in still water details of the system including the cage model the mooring lines and the arrangement of the various measurement instruments are introduced below 2 1 cage model description photo of the cage model from the front camera is presented in the left of fig 1 a sketch of the model and detailed dimensions are illustrated in fig 2 the model contained a vertical circular cylinder with draft h 0 75 m and outer diameter d 2 r 1 5 m the side wall of the cylindrical cage was made of polycarbonate resin lexan with thickness t c 5 mm the resulting diameter of the internal tank becomes d t 2 r t 1 49 m the tank bottom contains two layers a round pvc disk on top to prevent leakage of internal fluid and an divinycell plate below to add buoyancy both having a thickness of 10 mm leading to a tank depth h t 0 73 m a semi submerged torus shaped floating collar was attached to the outside of the cylindrical cage providing additional static stability and buoyancy the floating collar was made of plastic electrical tube with cross sectional diameter d f 0 05 m two massive aluminum rings were added above and below the floating collar to reduce the flexibility of the cage each with a cross sectional diameter of 20 mm three groups of vertical aluminum plates both inside and outside of the tank were used to connect the polycarbonate plate with 120 degrees between each two perpendicular steel square tubes were installed exterior to the cage bottom to reduce the deformation of the bottom plates the positions of the vertical aluminum plates and bottom steel tubes relative to the incident wave are illustrated in fig 3 showing an asymmetry of the model with respect to the x z plane the freeboard of the model was increased to h u 0 35 m to prevent spilling of water in high pitch roll motions by gluing two polycarbonate plates with an horizontal curved aluminum plate the main particulars of the model are given in table 1 the metacentric height given in the table is defined as g m c 55 ρ g with c 55 ρ g the restoring coefficient for pitch motion density of fresh water gravitational acceleration and water displacement of the model respectively c 55 is evaluated see faltinsen and timokha 2009 as 1 c 55 ρ g z b m g z g m l g z g l ρ g a w c x 2 d s ρ g a w f x 2 d s ρ g a w l x 2 d s where m is the mass of the dry model dry cage floating collar z g and z b are the corresponding center of gravity cog and center of buoyancy cob respectively m l is the mass of internal water and z g l h t 2 is the corresponding center of gravity a w c a w f and a w l are the waterplane area of the dry cage floating collar and internal water respectively the main reason for positive c 55 comes from the second last term i e the restoring provided by the floating collar the sum of the other terms equals approximately zero indicating that the model is not statically stable without the floating collar 2 2 mooring system description the cage model was moored with four mooring lines in the horizontal plane evenly distributed with 90 between each see fig 1 each of the four mooring lines was attached far away directly to horizontal free hanging coil springs the far away ends of the front two mooring lines l1 and l4 in fig 1 were elevated 1 m above the calm water surface while the aft two lines l2 and l3 in fig 1 were elevated to 0 6 m to avoid contact with water and disturbance of waves during the tests the stiffness of each coil spring was 60 n m yielding an equivalent stiffness k s 169 7 n m in x and in y directions for the system tension in each mooring line was measured by an uni axial load cell that connected the mooring line to the cage a pretension of f p r e 45 n was applied to all mooring lines to avoid them going slack during testing since the mooring lines considered are quite long approximately 33 m each the small height difference in the far away ends will cause a negligible static pitch the pretension in the mooring lines nevertheless will provide an additional equivalent pitch restoring coefficient c 55 p expressed as c 55 p f p r e d the restoring coefficient for pitch in eq 1 is corrected by accounting for also the contribution of the mooring lines the natural periods caused by the mooring system in surge and sway are much larger than our examined wave period range and have therefore negligible effect on our studied steady state response in regular waves 2 3 instrumentation the parameters of interest were global body motions internal sloshing and mooring loads the motions were measured using an optical positioning system qualisys oqus where the position of markers mounted on the model was tracked from camera images eight markers pos1 8 in fig 1 were installed along the perimeter of the cage model at freeboard level i e h u 0 35 m such that also eventual flexible radial deformations of the cage could be detected the accuracy of the motion measured by each individual marker was 0 2 mm this means a relative error of 0 02 in the experimental transfer functions when the incident wave amplitude is 1 cm the marker positions with respect to the positive x axis are provided in the left subtable of table 2 a set of three markers was also installed for 6 degree of freedom rigid body motions tracking see the white box installed at the freeboard of the cage in the left of fig 1 the rigid body motions measured with the three markers may be biased if the cage experiences elastic vibrations as the setup cannot distinguish the rigid motions from elastic vibrations wave induced accelerations of the model were measured by three accelerometers mounted on the cage side wall and could serve as a benchmark check of the measured motions from the markers detailed arrangement of the markers and accelerometers is illustrated in the right of fig 1 the model was also fitted with pairs of internal and external conventional wave probes distributed radially at eight positions along the side wall with a radial distance 0 05 r from the cage wall this means that the local wave elevation at the tank was measured in the body fixed reference frame sloshing of the contained water inside the cage model was measured by the internal eight wave probes rw1 8 while the wave elevation outside was captured by the external eight wave probes rw9 16 the wave gauge positions with respect to the positive x axis are provided in the right subtable of table 2 two more wave probes were installed 5 m away from the model to measure the front and side wave field named wave1 and wave3 in fig 1 prior to testing the wave field was calibrated without the presence of the model and an additional wave probe denoted wave2 was installed at the center position of the model all data acquisition was performed with a sampling frequency of 200 hz filtering of measured data was performed using an anti aliasing filter at 50 hz tests were recorded by three video cameras front top and side above the water surface and one camera under the water surface 2 4 test conditions the model was tested in regular waves and truncated white noise waves the regular wave tests were performed at a fixed wave steepness h λ 1 60 with h as the wave height and λ as the wave length in total 24 wave periods were considered varying from 0 6 s and 1 7 s it means that the corresponding wavelength to diameter ratio λ d changes from 0 38 to 3 0 the full scale wave height was within 0 25 m 2 03 m covering the sea conditions from small exposure to heavy exposure according to the norwegian aquaculture site classification shown in table 3 one more test with t 2 5 s and h 0 163 m was also conducted to examine the response of the cage in high exposure sea state a series of additional tests were performed at higher wave steepness h λ 1 45 the regular wave tests were performed to obtain approximately 2 3 min 12 min full scale data in addition two series of truncated white noise tests were executed to obtain continuous transfer functions within a given frequency region the term truncated white noise is used to describe a band limited white noise spectrum i e a square spectrum with nearly equal energy for all frequencies within the upper and lower bounds and with zero energy outside the bounds in the tests the lower and upper period region were 0 577 s 3 s full scale and 3 85 s 20 s full scale and two significant wave heights were considered in particular h s 0 037 m 1 m full scale and 0 074 m 2 m full scale hereafter the truncated white noise tests will be mentioned as white noise tests the white noise tests were conducted to obtain a 34 6 min 3 h full scale realization of the spectrum 2 5 decay tests free decay tests were carried out in surge heave and pitch to estimate the damping ratios and natural periods of these free motions the tests were started by giving the model an initial perturbation from equilibrium in the considered mode of motion trying to minimize the coupling with other modes from the free decays the natural period of surge heave and pitch are t n 1 22 4 s 116 4 s full scale t n 3 2 12 s 11 s full scale t n 5 2 76 s 14 36 s full scale respectively the free surface inside the tank can be approximated as horizontal at these frequencies and surge and pitch can as a first approximation be considered as uncoupled because it takes a long transient phase with given forcing frequency to develop steady state interior waves sloshing these tests do not provide information about coupled natural period between surge pitch and sloshing to be discussed below 2 6 resonance conditions for internal sloshing in order to analyze the effects of sloshing phenomena inside the cage we need to identify the occurrence and features of internal water resonance and therefore the sloshing natural frequencies and modes natural modes are nontrivial solutions to the linear boundary value problem for the water in the partially filled cage without external cage excitation according to faltinsen and timokha 2009 the velocity potential of liquid motion inside an upright circular cylindrical tank can be expressed in a cylindrical coordinate system o r θ z as 2 φ m n r θ z j m k m n r cosh k m n z h t cosh k m n h t cos m θ sin m θ where j m is the bessel function of the first kind of order m and h t is the tank water depth furthermore θ is defined in the right of fig 1 k m n l m n r t with r t the tank radius and l m n the non dimensional roots of the equation j m l m n 0 symbol prime indicates derivative of the function and m 0 1 2 n 1 2 3 both cos m θ and sin m θ modes can be excited given k m n the natural periods t m n corresponding to the different sloshing modes can be determined as 3 t m n 2 π g k m n tanh k m n h t the surface wave patterns of the normal modes can be found as f m n r θ φ m n r θ 0 and the sloshing mode shapes for m 0 1 2 3 and n 1 2 eight modes are presented in fig 4 3 signal processing in this section we will first introduce the approach to extract rigid body motions and radial elastic deformations from the measured translatory displacements of eight markers installed at the freeboard of the cage then the procedure to identify excitation of the sloshing modes from the internal eight wave probes is explained in regular waves steady state responses are of interest and the method to estimate the steady state amplitude and phase from the measured time series is also illustrated in the last part a brief explanation is given concerning the evaluation of transfer functions from the white noise tests 3 1 motion measurement as mentioned in section 2 3 two approaches were implemented to capture the motions of the cage i e using eight markers along the cage wall and using a three markers system the three markers system can be used to track the 6 dof linear rigid body motions for cases with negligible cage deformations while by manipulating the translatory motions of eight markers we can obtain both the rigid body motions and radial elastic deformations detailed explanation of the approach is given below according to linear theory the translatory motions s i of the i t h marker can be related to the body motions of the cage model as 4 s η 1 3 η 4 6 r d r where η 1 3 and η 4 6 are the three dimensional vectors of translatory and rotational rigid body modes of motion respectively while r is the position vector of the marker relative to the origin when at rest the additional term d r is included to account for possible deformations of the cage for the markers installed along the perimeter of the cage model with a given elevation z we will also operate with a cylindrical coordinate system o r θ z where x r cos θ y r sin θ z z eq 4 can be further expressed as 5 s s 1 i s 2 j s 3 k η 1 z η 5 y η 6 i η 2 z η 4 x η 6 j η 3 y η 4 x η 5 k d r η 1 z η 5 r sin θ η 6 i η 2 z η 4 r cos θ η 6 j η 3 r sin θ η 4 r cos θ η 5 k d r to account for the deformation in the radial direction at a given vertical position z and radial distance r r alternatively we can express the radial displacements as the following fourier series in θ 6 η r z t s n m 0 η r 1 m cos m θ m 1 η r 2 m sin m θ where n cos θ sin θ 0 and t is time this second approach will be pursued in the following in eq 6 η r 1 1 cos θ and η r 2 1 sin θ are local normal component due to rigid body surge and sway at level z respectively this can be expressed as η 1 z η 5 cos θ and η 2 z η 4 sin θ respectively this leads to η r 1 1 η 1 z η 5 and η r 2 1 η 2 z η 4 the contributions η r 1 2 cos 2 θ and η r 2 2 sin 2 θ are radial elastic ovalizing modes at level z as illustrated in fig 5 actually the displacements in vertical direction along the cage can also be expressed as a fourier series similar as done in radial direction but the deformations in vertical direction are expected to be small therefore to reduce complexity we just consider rigid body motions and the vertical translatory motion is expressed as 7 η z z t s 3 η 3 r sin θ η 4 r cos θ η 5 we will first show the procedure to obtain η 3 and η 5 eq 7 is projected along cos n θ it means that both sides are multiplied by cos n θ n 0 1 2 etc then it is integrated in θ between 0 and 2 π this gives 8 0 2 π s 3 cos n θ d θ 0 2 π η 3 r sin θ η 4 r cos θ η 5 cos n θ d θ s 3 is translatory motion in z direction and is a function of θ it can be obtained by implementing cubic spline interpolation in θ from the measured vertical displacements of the eight markers using the property of orthogonal functions the right side of eq 8 equals 2 π η 3 when n 0 if n 1 the value becomes π r η 5 similarly projecting eq 6 along cos n θ n 0 1 2 etc we can estimate coefficients η r 1 m for cos m θ modes known η r 1 1 and η 5 the rigid body surge motion can be readily obtained the same procedure is followed to obtain the sin m θ related terms in regular waves the linear steady state responses oscillating with incident wave frequency ω are of interest for instance the steady state radial displacements are expressed as 9 η r s z t m 0 η r a 1 m cos ω t ε r a 1 m cos m θ m 0 η r a 2 m cos ω t ε r a 2 m sin m θ here η r s is the linear steady state part of η r η r a j m and ε r a j m with j 1 2 are the corresponding amplitude and phase of cos m θ and sin m θ contributions respectively the phases are relative to the incident waves which are described by 10 ζ ζ a cos ω t k x where ζ a is the incident wave amplitude and k is the wave number for all examined tests k satisfies the deep water dispersion relationship i e k ω 2 g 3 2 internal wave elevation the wave elevations are measured relative to the tank fixed coordinate system to relate the internal wave with the natural sloshing modes fourier modes in θ for the internal waves are extracted based on the measurements from eight internal wave probes rw1 8 the free surface level inside the container at a given radial distance r 0 95 r is expressed as 11 ζ i n t t m 0 ζ 1 m cos m θ m 1 ζ 2 m sin m θ employing the same strategy as done in section 3 1 we can have the coefficients ζ 1 m and ζ 2 m for cos m θ and sin m θ modes respectively in regular waves the corresponding steady state linear free surface level is expressed as 12 ζ i n t s t m 0 ζ a 1 m cos ω t ε a 1 m cos m θ m 1 ζ a 2 m cos ω t ε a 2 m sin m θ here ζ i n t s is the linear steady state part of ζ i n t ζ a j m and ε a j m with j 1 2 are the corresponding amplitude and phase of cos m θ and sin m θ modes respectively 3 3 transfer function in regular waves the incident waves can be considered as deep water waves for illustration a typical time history of surge motion in regular wave is shown in the left plot of fig 6 the considered incident wave period and height are respectively t 1 02 s and h 0 027 m there is clearly a beating component with period of about 22 4 s this is the natural surge period of the system consisting of mooring lines and the cage longer time is needed to damp out this slowly varying component due to the small associated damping to estimate the steady state response and phase a time interval is extracted where the system is considered to have reached steady state the start time of this window is evaluated as t s t p t r a m p here t p l d c p is the time needed by the wave front for the considered regular wave to travel from the wavemaker to the model center position by assuming linear wave theory l d is the distance between the wavemaker and the model and c p is the wave group velocity t r a m p 35 t is used to remove the start up transient stage as illustrated in the right of fig 6 the end time is chosen as 0 95 t t o t with t t o t the length of the measured time series two strategies are adopted to evaluate the corresponding amplitude and phase of the response variable of interest the first is applying the fast fourier transform fft for the considered steady state interval then the amplitude and phase for the first harmonic component can be easily obtained the time series is tapered at both ends by means of a bingham window harris 1978 to reduce end effects of the extracted time interval the main shortcoming of this method is the unavailability of error bar of the amplitude which may serve as an indication of whether steady state is achieved alternatively we attempt to extract the response component oscillating with ω using band pass filtering only signal with frequency equal to ω is kept a gaussian mask hansen 2014 is multiplied to the signal frequency spectrum obtained by fourier transform fft the derived time history and the related envelope are shown in the right plot of fig 6 similar as in the first method a steady state time window is chosen and the hilbert transform oppenheim et al 2001 is used for calculating instantaneous properties of the resulting time series eventually the mean values representing the amplitude of the measurements and the standard deviations of the envelope curves are obtained the phase relative to the incident wave can be easily obtained by calculating the time offset δ t of zero up crossing between the two time series the response and the incident wave signals and estimated as 2 π δ t t the latter method is used for further analysis of transfer functions of the measured variables 3 4 transfer function in irregular waves for white noise tests transfer functions can be estimated in two ways using power spectral density psd and cross power spectral density cpsd of the incident wave and the measured variables bendat and piersol 2011 to evaluate the relevant spectra the signal is chopped into time windows in each of them a fourier transform is applied to determine its frequency components the predictions made in these time windows are then averaged to produce the estimated spectra welch 1967 as an example the transfer function of surge motion is given as 13 h η 1 η 1 s η 1 η 1 s ζ ζ or h η 1 ζ s η 1 ζ s ζ ζ where h η 1 η 1 is the response amplitude operator for surge from psd s η 1 η 1 is the power spectrum of surge motion and s ζ ζ the power spectrum of incident wave h η 1 ζ is the complex response operator for surge from cpsd including both amplitude and phase information s η 1 ζ is the cross power spectrum between surge motion and incident wave and is a complex variable a comparison of the response amplitude operator of surge motion from the two methods is presented in fig 7 versus incident wavelength to diameter ratio λ d the two methods yield similar results for shorter waves where the system is expected to behave more like a linear system larger difference is observed for longer waves i e involving periods larger than the relevant sloshing natural periods this suggests more pronounced nonlinear effects in surge as a consequence of its coupling with pitch in fact longer waves can induce stronger nonlinearities in pitch due to possible in and out of water on the floating collar this explanation is supported by later fig 13 where the linear potential flow solver wamit provides a poor prediction for pitch in longer waves since both the amplitude and phase information are of interest the method based on cpsd will be further adopted to calculate the transfer functions for the measured variables 4 experimental results and discussions in this section we show and discuss selected results from the model tests for the closed cage firstly the experimental accuracy in the generation of prescribed regular and white noise waves is assessed then transfer functions of the measured variables are shown finally the mean wave drift forces acting on the cage are examined results from the linear potential flow solver wamit lee 1995 are also provided assuming a rigid structure the sloshing part was verified by comparing with analytical expressions for surge and pitch added mass presented by faltinsen and timokha 2009 hydroelasticity was studied by combining wamit with ls dyna hallquist 2007 4 1 incident waves in order to quantify the experimental reliability in generating the prescribed waves preliminary wave propagation tests were performed with no model present in the wave basin an example of incident regular wave time history is given in the left plot of fig 8 with prescribed period and height respectively t 1 02 s and h 0 027 m to estimate the actual incident wave height the strategy described in section 3 3 is implemented and only the first harmonic component is considered the averaged wave height becomes 0 0246 m about 9 smaller than the prescribed value a more detailed comparison between the experimental and theoretical wave heights is shown in the right of fig 8 the generated incident waves at the model location were found to be in good agreement with the prescribed regular wave parameters for shorter waves but larger deviations were observed for longer waves tests with incident waves generated according to the truncated white noise spectrum with and without the model were also performed an example of incident white noise wave time history is provided in the left of fig 9 the prescribed significant wave height is h s 0 037 m and the frequency region with energy is between 0 208 hz and 1 732 hz the corresponding λ d changes between 0 346 and 15 42 theoretically the waves should have equal energy within the prescribed frequency region as shown by the red dashed line in the right of the plot of the figure the actual spectral density varies but with mean value close to the theoretical value the actual measured incident wave parameters will be used when evaluating the transfer functions however for convenience the prescribed incident wave parameters will be used in the figures captions and in the main text 4 2 transfer function of rigid cage motions as mentioned in section 2 3 the motions of the cage were measured with two methods either using the eight markers along the cage wall or obtained directly from the three markers system the former can provide both rigid motions and radial elastic deformations of the cage while the latter can provide 6 dof rigid body motions directly and is only applicable for bodies acting as fully rigid fig 10 shows the time histories of the surge heave and pitch motions obtained from the two methods for the case with t 2 5 s h 0 163 m and h λ 1 60 corresponding to λ d 6 5 the cage is expected to have negligible deformations for the examined case as it will tend to follow the waves so the three markers system could provide reliable rigid body motions the figure confirms that the two measurement techniques give consistent results showing the reliability of extracting the rigid and elastic body motions from the eight markers things change when the wavelength is not large compared to the cage diameter this is shown by the case with t 1 02 s h 0 027 m and h λ 1 60 corresponding to λ d 1 08 the time histories of the rigid body motions are shown in fig 11 the two measurements provide similar results at the initial stage but after about 70 periods larger difference is observed when the waves inside the cage become high in time and large ovalizing structural modes are excited the main reason for the difference is that the three markers system in principle cannot be applied for tests with non negligible body deformations as the rigid body motions cannot be separated from the elastic deformations a more detailed comparison of the rigid body motions from the two measurements for different wave periods is shown in fig 12 from the figure the two approaches provide consistent results for surge and heave motions in long waves λ d 1 6 larger differences are observed for all the three examined motions in short waves λ d 1 5 especially for wave periods close to the sloshing natural period t 21 where the cage experiences large ovalization deformations the rigid body motions from the eight markers will be used for further analysis fig 13 shows the comparisons for surge heave and pitch in a frequency range of primary importance for local wind generated waves experimental data from both regular waves and the two white noise tests are given results from the linear potential flow solver wamit are also provided motion amplitudes from regular waves in general agree nicely with those from the white noise tests especially when the latter is with smaller significant wave height i e h s 1 27 m the wave periods examined are far from the relevant rigid body natural periods without coupling to sloshing results from the two white noise tests match well for shorter waves λ d 1 5 but larger differences are observed for longer waves where the system is characterized by stronger nonlinearities as discussed later these may involve in general both potential flow and viscous flow effects with the latter connected with flow separation however calculations with an equivalent linearized damping corresponding to 10 of the critical damping were also performed by wamit not shown here to check the effect of viscous damping and small influence was observed for λ d 4 as a note the longer waves examined here correspond to periods still far from the natural pitch period important sloshing natural periods t 11 1 313 s t 21 0 996 s and t 12 0 753 s in model scale are denoted with vertical dashed lines in the figure surface wave pattern of the three sloshing modes are exemplified in fig 4 we should note that nearly zero surge is happening at λ d 1 794 corresponding to t t 11 which is consistent with linear sloshing theory when surge is uncoupled from pitch a coupled sloshing surge pitch natural period occurs according to linear theory at λ d 1 162 where we see a clear peak in theoretical and experimental results of surge and pitch it should be pointed out that λ d 1 03 corresponds to t t 21 the latter fact and closeness to the peak value at λ d 1 162 together with the fact that violent sloshing occurs must not be misinterpreted as sloshing resonance associated with t 21 resonant oscillations associated with t 21 cannot be excited according to linear theory for a rigid structure there is overall a good comparison between wamit and the experimental surge heave and pitch transfer functions however we note some differences for pitch for λ d 1 4 one reason can be large relative vertical motions at the floating collar causing nonlinearities of more importance for pitch than for surge and heave this can be directly seen by examining the restoring coefficients and the froude kriloff excitation loads which partly can be associated with the relative vertical wave elevation at the floater the measured relative wave elevation outside the cage is shown in fig 14 for the regular wave cases with steepness h λ 1 60 peaks and absolute values of troughs of the wave elevations from the three wave probes rw9 rw11 and rw13 defined in fig 1 are included the values are made nondimensional by the cross sectional radius of the floating collar r f the figure shows that the relative wave height in the front wave probe rw9 is apparently larger than in the side rw11 and back rw13 probes for cases with λ d 1 4 the nondimensional relative wave amplitude is larger than 1 implying that the front part of the floating collar will go in and out of the water this coincides with the region where wamit provides poor prediction of the pitch motion the large relative vertical motions suggest that flow separations occur we can make the analogy of ambient one dimensional oscillating flow past a 2d circular cylinder in infinite fluid and introduce the keulegan carpenter number kc π ζ r e l a r f the flow separates from the analogue cylinder when kc 2 comparisons of the phase of the motions from the experiments and from wamit calculations are presented in fig 15 the values from the regular wave tests and white noise tests are consistent which demonstrates the feasibility of performing white noise tests to obtain the transfer functions also reasonable good agreement between the numerical and experimental results is obtained this is consistent with the discussion in section 1 concerning the fact that the sloshing response can be mild if the coupled natural frequency ω coupl 1 is not close to the natural sloshing frequency ω 1 in fact in this case ω coupl 1 ω 1 1 25 and a linear potential solver can provide reasonable predictions one needs to point out that the results from the regular wave tests show a jump in the surge from value close to 180 to approximately 180 near λ d 1 see left of fig 15 this is connected with the analysis used to estimate the phase angle defined between 180 and 180 we could manually change the sign of the phase in order to avoid the jump but we preferred to leave the results as obtained from the analysis in any case this does not affect the actual complex transfer function response amplitude operators for λ d 3 7 are also presented to examine the behavior of the system in long waves see fig 16 wamit predicts a coupled surge pitch natural period corresponding to λ d 7 6 since the wave radiation damping is very small large resonant values are predicted the white noise tests with lower wave amplitude indicate mild peaks in surge and pitch at slightly larger λ d while the tests at larger wave amplitude do not document clear peaks in this wavelength region this suggests an importance of nonlinear viscous and potential flow effects in the tests since these nonlinearities are not so important for instance for the heave restoring coefficient wamit documents a reasonable agreement with experimental resonant heave values to understand better the wave body interaction close to the resonance zone we can examine the corresponding regular wave case a regular wave test with t 2 5 s corresponding to λ d 6 5 was performed with h 0 163 m and the time histories of motions are shown in fig 10 the heave motion transfer function from regular wave test matches with the white noise value but this is not the case for the surge and pitch especially for the pitch a so called mathieu type instability occurred for the pitch motion for the regular wave case due to in and out of water of the floating collar as a consequence of large heave motion and heave pitch coupling see snapshots shown in fig 17 mathieu type of instability is well known for parametric roll of ship ghamari et al 2020 and for buoys haslum and faltinsen 1999 the pitch motion comprises two harmonic components oscillating with t and 2 t respectively the corresponding time histories are shown in the left plot of fig 18 the subharmonic 2 t is the one connected with the pitch instability becoming dominant as time goes on and cannot be predicted by linear potential theory the metacentric height gm c 55 ρ g with c 55 given in eq 1 is modified by a quasistatic formulation where the effect of heave and incident wave is accounted for it means that ρ g a w f x 2 d s is modified by considering measured relative vertical elevations at the floating collar as presented in fig 14 furthermore ρ g z b is modified by accounting for the relative vertical motions the time history of gm is shown in the right of fig 18 from the figure we note that gm has a constant term gm m plus a time dependent term the dominant component of the latter follows δ gm cos ω gm t ε gm with δ gm ω gm and ε gm the corresponding oscillation amplitude frequency and phase respectively the pitch behavior can be explained by introducing mathieu equation the mathieu equation follows by setting up the uncoupled pitch equation with zero excitation and is given as 14 i 55 a 55 η 5 ρ g gm m 1 δ gm gm m cos ω gm t ε gm η 5 0 here i 55 and a 55 are the inertia moment and added mass for the pitch motion respectively the undamped natural frequency for pitch is expressed as ω n 5 ρ g gm m i 55 a 55 from fig 18 the new mean metacentric height gm m 0 32 gm m 0 with gm m 0 the initial metacentric height in calm water this leads to the change of ω n 5 from 0 427 rad s to 0 244 rad s the time dependent term oscillates with frequency ω gm ω 0 483 rad s and amplitude δ gm 5 37 gm m fig 19 shows the stability diagram for mathieu equation from klotter 2013 for the examined case ω n 5 ω 0 5 and δ gm gm m 5 37 corresponding to the red circle in the figure because in our case ξ ω n ω 0 0178 with ξ as the damping ratio between pitch radiation damping and the critical damping the mathieu instability will then be excited similar phenomenon was observed in an irregular wave test not discussed in detail in the present paper with peak wave period t p 1 924 s and significant wave height h s 0 11 m corresponding in full scale to the extreme sea state defined in table 3 the relevant power spectra for the incident wave heave and pitch motions are shown in fig 20 the peak pitch response occurs at wave period close to 2 t n 3 instead of at the natural pitch period t n 5 due to large resonant heave motion at t n 3 since our focus is on wave conditions associated with local wind generated waves more detailed discussions for the system in long waves and about the importance of accounting for system nonlinearity are left for future work high harmonic components of the rigid body motions from the regular waves tests are also analyzed and are generally moderate compared with the first harmonic value i e less than 10 4 3 transfer function of radial elastic deformations as explained in section 3 1 we can extract both rigid body motions and radial elastic deformations from the measurements of eight markers installed at the freeboard of the cage fig 21 presents the transfer functions of the ovalizing modes cos 2 θ and sin 2 θ of the fish cage at z 0 35 m from both the regular wave tests and white noise tests the fact that the ovalizing mode sin 2 θ occurs is partly a consequence of structural asymmetry the peak deformation occurs at λ d 1 078 t 1 018 s for both modes close to the corresponding sloshing natural period t 21 0 996 s we should note that the value is different from the coupled sloshing surge pitch natural period and is a consequence of coupling between structural ovalizing modes and corresponding sloshing modes results from the regular wave tests are in general consistent with those from the white noise tests except near the resonant zone the difference between the two white noise tests at the resonant frequency indicates the occurrence of free surface nonlinearities similar difference was observed between the results from the white noise tests and irregular wave tests not presented in the paper time histories of the ovalization modes from the regular wave test at the resonant period are shown in fig 22 two extra elastic modes are included the figure shows that the ovalizing modes dominate over other modes and due to small damping do not reach steady state within the time duration of the test the build up of the sin 2 θ mode is initially slower than for the cos 2 θ mode later on the values of the two ovalizing modes become similar in magnitude one reason may be coupling with nonlinear sloshing and associated transfer of energy as detailed studied by faltinsen and timokha 2009 for prescribed horizontal motion of a rigid vertical tank near the highest sloshing period due to unrealistic large error bar associated the corresponding regular wave values are not presented in fig 21 the fact that the sin 2 θ component is clearly smaller than the cos 2 θ component outside resonance is qualitatively consistent with the structural asymmetry introduced by the construction of the vertical cylinder and the cross bar exterior to the tank bottom see fig 2 the transfer functions of other elastic modes are small i e less than 2 so are not presented here the ratio between the wet and dry natural periods of the ovalizing modes is 9 a major reason is the influence of sloshing on the corresponding generalized added mass a numerical analysis of the ovalizing modes has been attempted by combining a fem software ls dyna hallquist 2007 with wamit the implemented fem structural model is based on the left of fig 2 with only shell elements used the aluminum rings with d 20 mm are approximated with plane shell elements of 15 5 mm to hit the first two experimentally obtained dry natural frequencies the presence of the thin plastic floater is neglected in the fem model the influence of the h60 divinycell is neglected as its tensile compressive modulus is significantly smaller than that of pvc the numerical model includes the hydroelastic response by including the structural modes calculated by eigen value analysis in absence of liquid here we have neglected the effect of water on the mode shapes added mass and damping terms for the flexible modes as well as their coupling with rigid modes are included in the total added mass and damping matrices hence the linear hydrodynamic coupling between rigid and flexible modes has been modeled the first two orthogonal modes are relevant for the ovalizing deformations and are used as generalized modes in wamit hence the matrices have a 8x8 dimension i e 6 rigid plus 2 flexible modes generalized mass and stiffness matrices from the eigen value analysis of the dry model are included in the equation system the modal shapes of the first two orthogonal modes are shown in fig 23 the predicted radial ovalizing deformations are presented in fig 21 the resonant frequencies in model tests are captured relatively well by the numerical model the response amplitudes are also well predicted except in the resonant region with an obvious overestimation a possible reason for the overestimation could be due to the free surface nonlinearities in the experiments the current numerical method in frequency domain is a practical approach for the initial design stage to have a good overview of the hydroelastic response of a fish cage in a wide frequency range with small computational cost however if nonlinear sloshing is present a time domain simulation approach must be considered in which free surface nonlinearity is adopted at least in the internal domain 4 4 transfer function of interior waves free surface elevation inside the container was measured by the eight interior wave probes rw1 8 see fig 1 the probes were installed as fixed to the cage so the measured values are related to the tank fixed coordinate system as an example transfer functions of the wave probes rw1 and rw4 are provided in fig 24 the two peaks close to t 12 and t 21 are associated with the corresponding natural sloshing modes in fact one should note that the coupling between sloshing and body motions affects the natural periods the maximum values occur at the same wave period as that of the ovalizing modes i e at λ d 1 078 the corresponding time histories of the wave elevation from the regular wave test are shown in fig 25 the figure clearly shows that the interior wave is still accumulating and more time than examined experimentally is needed to reach steady state this is similar as that shown in fig 22 for the elastic deformations also in this case it leads to unrealistic large error bars for the transfer functions not presented in fig 24 to better relate the interior wave elevation with sloshing modes the fourier components cos m θ and sin m θ of the internal waves are calculated at r 0 95 r based on the method explained in section 3 2 transfer functions of the first three cos m θ m 0 1 2 modes and the first two sin m θ m 1 2 modes are presented in fig 26 relevant sloshing natural periods for different modes are indicated by the vertical dashed lines there is only a cos θ component according to linear rigid body theory numerical prediction from wamit for cos θ mode is also provided and good agreement with the experimental results is observed especially for shorter waves λ d 1 5 the modes cos θ and sin θ are 90 out of phase at resonance which implies swirling however we note the dominant contribution of the cos 2 θ and sin 2 θ terms at resonance and the corresponding phase difference is 180 the phase difference is evaluated based on the approach introduced in section 3 3 the fact that the sin 2 θ mode occurs is associated with structural asymmetry and free surface nonlinearities the interior wave elevations associated with the ovalizing deformations are also evaluated based on the hydroelasticity analysis introduced in section 4 3 and are presented in the bottom of fig 26 similar as that for the ovalizing deformations the numerical tool can provide a reasonable prediction of the interior wave amplitudes but not in the resonant region with a clear overestimation at the resonant period 4 5 mean wave drift forces when interacting with the cage the incident waves will cause mean drift loads on the cage due to the far field waves generated by the structure the mean surge force is of particular interest as it is important for a mooring analysis two methods are pursued to estimate the mean wave drift force in surge 1 from tension measurement of the mooring lines 2 by multiplying the mean surge motion with the equivalent linear stiffness k s of the system documented in section 2 2 in the left plot of fig 27 we present the time histories of the surge force from the two methods for t 1 25 s h 0 041 m and λ d 1 628 the two strategies yield similar results when the cage is freely floating without incoming waves t 40 t a possible reason that the cage has nonzero surge motion in still water is that the time interval between two successive tests was not long enough to dampen out the slowly varying surge motion larger differences are observed for both the mean value and amplitude when the cage interacts with the incident waves the possible reasons for the differences are 1 the model was moored by four horizontal mooring lines which were attached directly to horizontal free hanging coil springs the length of the mooring lines was quite long about 33 m in model scale so the weight of the springs will influence the measured forces 2 videos from the tests show that part of the mooring lines got wet during the tests in waves 3 cage deformations would also influence the mooring loads however the large amplification of the cos 2 θ and sin 2 θ response at resonance see fig 21 indicates small wave radiation due to cage deformation and thereby small influence on the wave drift force in the right of fig 27 we shows the comparison of the mean surge forces from the regular wave tests with those from wamit irregular wave periods corresponding to eigenperiods for the interior problem with zero dirichlet condition on the body boundary condition are suppressed in wamit results the kink at λ d 0 58 is associated with the sloshing natural period t 12 as shown in fig 13 the experimental values are estimated by multiplying the mean surge motion with equivalent stiffness the evaluation based on the measurement of mooring forces was also performed but the obtained values were quite scattered so they are not shown the asymptotic value of f 1 ρ g ζ a 2 d is 1 3 for λ d 0 according to second order potential flow theory this is in good agreement with wamit 5 conclusions in this paper we presented a scaled experimental study of a closed floating cage in waves the tests were performed in an ocean basin to avoid possible reflections from side tank walls a main purpose was to investigate how sloshing would influence the global response of the cage the interior wave elevation and also the mean drift loads the model was tested in both regular waves and truncated white noise waves a focus was on the transfer functions in the wave period region associated with local wind generated waves the radial elastic deformations of the cage were extracted from the measurements of the eight markers installed on the freeboard and relatively large ovalizing radial deformations were observed for wave periods close to the natural sloshing period t 21 associated with the sloshing modes having a cos 2 θ and sin 2 θ dependence the fourier modes of the interior wave were also evaluated based on the wave elevations of the eight internal wave probes the cos 2 θ and sin 2 θ modes were found to be dominant and the resonance period coincided with that for the ovalizing radial deformations the above results imply that hydroelasticity matters and a non dimensional parameter involving young s modulus should be introduced to scale the model test results to full scale a rational numerical hydroelastic method can be a useful tool in the scaling and requires further studies numerical predictions from the linear potential flow solver wamit were also provided assuming a rigid body good agreements between the numerical and experimental results were obtained for both the rigid body motions and corresponding interior wave elevation actually linear potential flow theory can provide a good description of the interior sloshing if the structure is rigid and the coupled natural frequency between surge pitch and sloshing ω coupl 1 is not close to the lowest natural sloshing frequency ω 1 as it is the case in the present paper nice agreement was also achieved between the numerical predictions and experimental results for the mean drift forces despite large ovalizing radial modes involved it seems that the mean wave forces are not so influenced by the elastic deformations of the body and a reliable mooring force analysis can still be performed neglecting body elasticity a numerical analysis of the ovalizing modes was also attempted by combining the structural analysis program ls dyna with wamit the resonant frequencies in model tests were well captured in terms of the ovalizing deformations and interior waves the proposed numerical tool could provide reasonable predictions except in the resonant zone where the free surface nonlinearities may matter with a clear overestimation from the linear results in the present study a torus shaped floater was applied to increase the static stability of the cage in roll and pitch from the model tests the floating collar can easily go in and out water due to small draft causing parametric pitch instability in long waves and consequently large pitch motion to avoid such drawback a floater with much larger draft is suggested so to avoid a time dependent change of the restoring stiffness and consequently prevent instability credit authorship contribution statement yugao shen conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation writing

20363,deepwater anchors typically the suction embedded plate anchor sepla and the omni max anchor would encounter the phenomenon of embedment loss after initial penetration which remarkably reduces

systems served for different applications of floating structures in deep waters they are generally classified according to the installation way typically the suction anchor the drag embedment plate anchor the suction embedded plate anchor sepla and the gravity installed anchor gia the pullout capacity and the kinematic property of the anchor are directly affected by the installation way and the structural characteristic of the anchor and are persistently challenging researches due to the complexity and variety of anchors although different in both installation way and structure an inreversible embedment loss after initial penetration of the anchor can be observed for the sepla and the omni max anchor a type of gias which remarkably reduces the pullout capacity and affects the subsequent behavior of the anchor due to importance and particularity the maximum embedment loss mel becomes a key index for design and engineering practice of seplas and omni max anchors earlier studies on the mel of seplas were performed by field tests wilde et al 2001 centrifuge tests song et al 2006 gaudin et al 2006 o loughlin et al 2006 gaudin et al 2009 plastic limit analyses yang et al 2012 cassidy et al 2012 and large deformation finite element analyses yu et al 2009 song et al 2009 wang et al 2011 zhao et al 2016 several parameters were regarded as influential ones in the centrifuge studies including the anchor geometry the padeye eccentricity and the angle of the anchor line at seafloor based on numerical analyses song et al 2009 proposed an empirical formula for predicting the mel of seplas under vertical pullout loading which takes into account the padeye eccentricity the thickness and area of the plate anchor the net moment acting on the anchor under initial vertical loading and the undrained shear strength at the initial embedment depth wang et al 2011 also recommended an empirical formula based on numerical analyses except the form of expression the difference between the two formulae is that the latter does not introduce the net moment at the initial position but directly reflects the other three factors that affect the embedment loss however both of the formulae cannot apply to the inclined pullout loading limiting the applicability of the formulae to more general loading conditions compared to seplas few studies were performed on the mel of omni max anchors plastic limit analyses wei et al 2015 liu et al 2016 han et al 2018 proved that the soil strength the padeye eccentricity ratio the loading angle at seafloor and the anchor line parameters are significant to the trajectory and mel of omni max anchors based on numerical analyses using the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel technique zhao and liu 2017 proposed an empirical formula for predicting the mel of omni max anchors which takes into account the installation mooring line property the loading angle at seafloor the loading velocity and the clayey soil property kim and hossain 2017 also adopted cel numerical analyses and proved that the mel of omni max anchors is related to the padeye offset ratio and the loading angle at the shackle without taking the anchor line into account actually the parameters of anchor lines affect the loading angle at the shackle resulting in an important impact on the mel as demonstrated by zhao and liu 2017 although different methods could analyze the effects of various parameters on the mel of anchors only the empirical formula is easier in usage and can produce a fast and quantitative result this is why many researchers tried to develop empirical formulae however existing formulae fail to account for all necessary parameters that affect the mel such as the inclined loading angle and the anchor line parameters for seplas and the padeye offset ratio for omni max anchors unfortunately there is much space to improve the prediction accuracy for the formulae of both seplas and omni max anchors these weaken the rationality and applicability of the formulae in engineering analyses and applications the present work aims to develop a unified explicit formula for calculating the mel of both seplas and omni max anchors different from existing formulae which were all obtained from numerical results the present formula is basically derived from mechanism analyses and theoretical models and hence has the ability to account for all necessary parameters that affect the mel based on the kinematic characteristics of the anchor at the mel the mechanical equilibrium equation is established to reflect the mechanical mechanism of the anchor at the mel the coupling effects among the anchor the anchor line and the clayey seabed are considered in constructing the model at the mel through systematic parametric studies of the theoretical model the regularity of the mel varying with the parameters is analyzed the data from the theoretical model are then fitted by the nonlinear regressive method to obtain a unified explicit formula for calculating the mel of both seplas and omni max anchors finally comparative studies for the two types of anchors are performed to examine the effectiveness and veracity of the developed formula 2 mechanical models for the mel in this section the mechanical models at the mel will be established for both seplas and omni max anchors the centroid of the anchor is considered as the reference point and the mel of the anchor z m e l is defined as the difference between the initial embedment depth h 0 and the embedment depth when reaching the mel z c of the reference point the anchor may present comprehensive behaviors in the seabed due to complicated loadings which can be divided into keying pulling out and diving for a sepla keying means the rotation of the anchor around a rotational center pulling out means the movement of the anchor perpendicular to the plate and diving means the movement of the anchor along the plate peng and liu 2019 in the present work correctly describing the three behaviors and corresponding conditions is the basis of the mechanical models at the mel for both seplas and omni max anchors 2 1 sepla when a sepla just reaches the mel the anchor meets two conditions 1 the anchor is in the critical state that changes from keying to pulling out and 2 the applied loading at the shackle is approximately perpendicular to the plate wilde et al 2001 gaudin et al 2006 o loughlin et al 2006 as illustrated in fig 1 a the mechanical model when the anchor stays in keying or in pulling out is shown in fig 2 in which point a denotes the anchor t a and m a denote the tension of applied loading at the shackle and the loading force moment respectively f b and f s denote the total end bearing and the total shear force in the direction of pulling out respectively and m s denote the total end bearing moment and the total shear moment respectively w and m w denote the submerged anchor weight and the total gravity moment respectively θ a and θ a h denote the loading angles at the shackle relative to the plate and the horizontal respectively θ o denotes the orientation of the plate relative to the horizontal which satisfies θ a h θ o θ a l c is the distance from the rear of the fluke to the intersection between the applied loading and the fluke and l k is the distance from the rear of the fluke to the rotational center of the anchor according to the force equilibrium and the moment equilibrium for keying and pulling out of the anchor the equilibrium equations can be established as 1 t a 1 l c m b m s m w keying t a f b f s w sin θ a h pulling out based on the bearing capacity formula proposed by skempton 1951 the total end bearing f b and the total shear force f s acting on the sepla can be expressed as 2 f b n c s u a b 1 a b 2 f s α s u a s 1 a s 2 a s 3 a s 4 where n c is the end bearing capacity factor α is the adhesion factor a b 1 a b 2 and a s 1 a s 4 are effective end bearing areas and effective shear areas of the sepla under pulling out respectively as listed in table 1 and s u is the undrained shear strength of clay expressed by s u s u 0 k z c in which s u 0 is the undrained shear strength at seafloor and k is the gradient of undrained shear strength with depth based on the previous study of peng and liu 2019 m b and m s are expressed by 3 m b n k s u a b 1 l b 1 a b 2 l b 2 a b 3 l b 3 m s α s u a s 1 l s 1 a s 2 l s 2 a s 3 l s 3 a s 4 l s 4 a s 5 l s 5 where a b 1 a b 3 are effective end bearing areas of the sepla under keying and l b 1 l b 3 are the corresponding moment arms for a b 1 a b 3 respectively a s 1 a s 5 are effective shear areas of the sepla under keying and l s 1 l s 5 are the corresponding moment arms for a s 1 a s 5 respectively and n k is the coefficient of soil resistance under keying expressed by n k 6 28 27 8 l k l f 2 2 l f 2 peng and liu 2019 in which l f herein is identical to the plate width b the value of l k is determined by the least force principle proposed by peng and liu 2019 more details of the method can be found in this reference some coefficients mentioned above are listed in table 2 where l s denotes the shank length l b denotes the distance from the rear of the plate to the plate shank connection point and θ s denotes the shank angle note that the expressions of f b f s m b and m s all contain the parameter s u by introducing the parameters η f f b f s s u and η m m b m s s u l c eq 1 can be rewritten as 4 t a s u 0 k z c η m w sin θ a h w s l s 2 l c cos θ a h keying t a s u 0 k z c η f w sin θ a h pulling out where w w a w s in which w a is the submerged plate weight and w s is the submerged shank weight therefore the unknown variables θ a h and t a are derived from eq 4 as 5 θ a h cos 1 ξ s u 0 k z c t a s u 0 k z c η f w 1 ξ 2 s u 0 k z c 2 where ξ 2 l c η f η m w s l s due to the anchor movement θ a h and t a would change with the embedment depth and cause a significant impact on the anchor behavior at the mel the chain equation of neubecker and randolph 1995 is introduced to reflect the interaction between the anchor line and the anchor which is expressed by 6 t a 1 μ 2 e μ θ a h θ cos θ μ sin θ θ e θ a h 0 z a c f s u d z where μ is the frictional coefficient c f e n d n c l in which n c l is the bearing capacity factor for the anchor line d is the diameter of the anchor line and e n is the multiplier of effective width in the normal direction to the anchor line θ e is the loading angle relative to the horizontal at seafloor and z a is the embedment depth of the shackle which satisfies z a z c e n cos θ o e p sin θ o where e n and e p are the padeye eccentricity normal to the shaft and padeye offset parallel to the shaft of the anchor respectively for the mechanical model of sepla fig 2 e p 0 and θ o 90 θ a h and thus z a z c e n sin θ a h then the implicit set of equations of z c is listed below 7 t a 1 μ 2 e μ θ a h θ cos θ μ sin θ θ e θ a h 0 z

the behavior of keying and the loss of embedment depth of omni max anchors are similar to those of seplas as illustrated in fig 1 b however the anchor possesses a truly three dimensional structure composed of one shaft and six fins which affects the soil resistance and the kinematic behavior of the anchor besides when the omni max anchor just reaches the mel it changes from keying to translating in a synthetical movement direction of diving and pulling out for the omni max anchor diving means the movement of the anchor along the shaft and pulling out means the movement of the anchor perpendicular to the shaft the differences above should be specially addressed in constructing the mechanical model of omni max anchors when the omni max anchor just reaches the mel it satisfies two conditions 1 the anchor stays in a critical state from keying to translating in a synthetical movement direction of diving and pulling out liu et al 2016 zhao and liu 2017 and 2 the applied loading at the shackle of the anchor is almost perpendicular to the anchor shaft shelton 2007 the mechanical model of the omni max anchor at the mel is illustrated in fig 3 when the anchor reaches the mel the equilibrium equation of keying is established with the condition of zero resultant moment and the equilibrium equation of translating is established in the synthetical movement direction θ m h as expressed by 9 t a 1 l c sin θ a m b m s m w keying t a 1 cos θ a h θ m h f b f s w sin θ m h translating where θ a denotes the loading angle at the shackle to the anchor shaft and θ m h denotes the movement direction or angle of translating to the horizontal the value of θ m h is positive θ m h 0 when the direction is above the horizontal the total end bearing f b and total shear force f s are expressed by 10 f b n c s u a b 1 sin θ m a b 3 cos θ m a b 4 sin θ s θ m f s α s u a s 1 sin θ m a s 2 cos θ s θ m a s 3 a s 4 a s 5 cos θ m where a b 1 a b 3 and a b 4 are effective end bearing areas and a s 1 a s 5 are effective shear areas of the anchor under translating as listed in table 1 and θ m is the movement angle of translating to the anchor shaft which satisfies θ m θ o θ m h the total end bearing moment m b and the total shear moment m s acting on the anchor are related to l k l s and l b based on the previous study of peng and liu 2019 m b and m s can be further expressed as following if l k l b l s cos θ s there is 11 1 m b n k s u a b 1 l b 1 a b 2 l b 2 a b 3 l b 3 m s α s u a s 1 l s 1 a s 2 l s 2 a s 3 l s 3 a s 4 l s 4 if l b l s cos θ s l k l b there is 11 2 m b n k s u a b 1 l b 1 a b 2 l b 2 a b 4 l b 4 a b 5 l b 5 m s α s u a s 1 l s 1 a s 2 l s 2 a s 3 l s 3 a s 6 l s 6 a s 7 l s 7 if l k l b there is 11 3 m b n k s u a b 1 l b 1 a b 2 l b 2 a b 3 l b 3 m s α s u a s 1 l s 1 a s 2 l s 2 a s 3 l s 3 a s 4 l s 4 where a b 1 a b 5 are effective end bearing areas and l b 1 l b 5 are the corresponding moment arms of the anchor under keying respectively a s 1 a s 4 and a s 6 a s 7 are effective shear areas and l s 1 l s 4 and l s 6 l s 7 are the corresponding moment arms of the anchor under keying respectively and n k is the coefficient of soil resistance under keying expressed by n k 6 28 27 8 l k l f 2 2 l f 2 peng et al 2016 in which l f is the anchor length and herein denoted by b for omni max anchors as for seplas the coefficients mentioned in eq 11 are listed in table 2 the parameter s u is a common multiplier in the expressions of f b f s m b and m s and thus the combination coefficients of soil resistance under keying and translating η f and η m can be expressed as η f f b f s s u cos θ a h θ m h and η m m b m s s u l c sin θ a eq 9 can be further expressed as 12 t a s u 0 k z c η m m w 1 l c sin θ a keying t a s u 0 k z c η f w sin θ m h cos θ a h θ m h translating the loading angle at the shackle relative to the shaft θ a is a key parameter data from zhao and liu 2017 as listed in table 3 demonstrated that the maximum value of θ a was approximately 85 when the anchor reached the mel based on the results of θ a varying with the horizontal displacement of the shackle zhao and liu 2017 illustrated that the anchor had reached the maximum pullout capacity before it reached the mel θ a 90 therefore the value of θ a at the mel could not be simply considered as 90 as for seplas and needs to be further determined according to the cases in table 3 the parameters c f and k have very small effects on θ a while θ e and h 0 b have significant effects on θ a thus a nonlinear fitting of θ a with the coefficient of determination r 2 0 98 can be obtained as 13 θ a 0 055 θ e h 0 b 1 642 85 54 the padeye offset ratio with the anchor centroid the reference point can be defined as 14 ω e p e n when the omni max anchor reaches the mel the angle of the anchor movement to the horizontal θ m h is also a key parameter which determines the direction of translating the values of θ m h extracted from the data of zhao and liu 2017 and liu et al 2016 are listed in table 3 obviously the value of θ m h is sensitive to the parameters h 0 b θ e k c f and ω the parameters k and c f both have a positive influence thus a nondimensional parameter k c f γ s b is combined considering the influential trend of each parameter the nonlinear fitting analyses result in a prediction formula of θ m h with the coefficient of determination r 2 0 96 15 θ m h 1 56 37 16 θ e h 0 b 0 78 k c f γ s b 0 38 ω 0 27 ω 1 19 therefore the unknown variables θ a h and t a are derived from eq 12 as 16 θ a h θ m h cos 1 ζ w sin θ m h t a s u 0 k z c η f w sin θ m h cos θ a h θ m h where ζ m w l c sin θ a s u 0 k z c η f η m 1 then by combining the chain equation i e eq 6 the implicit set of equations of z c is listed below 17 t a 1 μ 2 e μ θ a h θ cos θ μ sin θ θ e θ a h 0 z a c f s u d z θ a h θ m h cos 1 ζ w sin θ m h t a s u 0 k z c η f w sin θ m h cos θ a h θ m h 3 unified explicit formula of mel the key to solve z m e l is to acquire the value of z c which could be obtained from the implicit sets of equations of z c i e eq 7 for seplas and eq 17 for omni max anchors then the nondimensional mel z m e l b can be expressed as 18 z m e l b h 0 b z c b z c f t e n e p c f μ θ e k s u 0 n c α where t denotes the plate thickness of seplas or the fin width of omni max anchors in order to obtain an explicit expression of mel parametric analyses are performed at first the effects of various parameters in the mechanical models of mel are not fully clear for both seplas and omni max anchors these parameters come from the anchor geometry length b thickness or fin width t padeye eccentricity e n and padeye offset e p the anchor line property constant multiplier c f the interactional property end bearing capacity factor n c adhesion factor α and frictional coefficient μ the clay property shear strength at seafloor s u 0 and shear strength gradient k and the applied loading loading angle at seafloor θ e therefore ten cases are hypothesized for both seplas and omni max anchors to investigate these parameters as listed in tables 4 and 5 variations of the mel with different parameters are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 for seplas the anchor models used in parametric analyses are rectangular plate anchors with shanks the dimension of seplas has a wide range according to previous investigations the plate width is set as 2m the anchor aspect ratio l b is set from 1 to 4 which was also adopted by o loughlin et al 2006 the anchor thickness ratio t b varies in the range 0 05 0 20 song et al 2009 gaudin et al 2009 the padeye eccentricity ratio e n b ranges in 0 15 1 5 o loughlin et al 2006 then according to the ratios as listed in table 4 the anchor length thickness and padeye eccentricity can be determined fig 4 a reveals that the anchor length l b has only a slight effect on the mel this is accordant with the observations in centrifuge tests o loughlin et al 2006 and fe analyses wang et al 2011 fig 4 b reveals that the mel presents an evident increasing trend with decreasing value of t b on account of the effects of anchor thickness on soil resistance and gravity the padeye eccentricity ratio e n b determines the position of the applied loading acting at the anchor which affects soil resistance and the embedment depth fig 4 c demonstrates that the mel decreases with increasing value of e b for omni max anchors the fin width t was reported as 1 96m by shelton 2007 and 1 89m by gaudin et al 2013 to investigate the effect of t on the mel the value of t is postulated in the range 1 76 2 26m as presented in fig 5 a the mel decreases with increasing value of t b the padeye eccentricity e n and the padeye offset e p are postulated in the ranges 1 7 2 44m shelton 2007 zimmerman et al 2009 gaudin et al 2013 liu et al 2016 and 0 69 0 99m kim and hossain 2017 liu et al 2018 respectively fig 5 b and c reveal that the mel presents an evident increasing trend with increasing values of e n and e p possible soil strength profiles are selected as listed in tables 4 and 5 for seplas the soil strength at seafloor s u 0 ranges in 0 30kpa liu et al 2010 and the soil strength gradient k varies in the range 0 7 1 5kpa m wang et al 2011 for omni max anchors the shear strength gradient k 0 6 3 3kpa m and the shear strength at seafloor s u 0 0 20kpa are adopted to evaluate their effects on the mel liu et al 2016 zhao and liu 2017 as illustrated in fig 4 d and e and fig 5 d and e the increase of soil strength results in an increasing mel the parameter of the anchor line i e the constant multiplier c f is selected as listed in tables 4 and 5 for seplas the value of n c l ranges in 7 6 14 liu et al 2012 and the diameter of the anchor line ranges in 0 05 0 3m murff et al 2005 gaudin et al 2006 thus the value of c f is determined in the range 0 38 4 2m for omni max anchors the parameter c f is postulated in the range 0 76 6 08 zhao and liu 2017 to investigate the effect of the anchor line on the mel curves in figs 4 f and 5 f demonstrate that the mel increases with increasing value of c f based on earlier studies for seplas the values of the end bearing capacity factor n c and the adhesion factor α range in 7 6 12 9 skempton 1951 song et al 2006 gaudin et al 2006 and 0 3 0 5 murff et al 2005 gaudin et al 2006 respectively for omni max anchors the bearing capacity factor n c varies in 7 5 14 3 skempton 1951 wei et al 2015 liu et al 2016 zhao and liu 2017 and the adhesion factor α is selected in the range 0 2 1 0 gaudin 2013 zhao and liu 2017 as observed in fig 4 g and h and fig 5 g and h the mel increases with increasing values of n c and α the value of μ was adopted in the range 0 4 0 6 neubecker and randolph 1995 dnv 2000 recommended μ 0 1 0 3 for wires and μ 0 6 0 8 for chains thus the range of μ is determined as 0 1 0 8 for both seplas and omni max anchors figs 4 i and 5 i demonstrate that the mel increases with decreasing value of μ the loading angle at seafloor θ e is selected in the range 0 90 to reflect possible loading conditions for seplas the omni max anchor has the diving trend with the value of θ e less than 30 as demonstrated by liu et al 2016 and zhao and liu 2017 hence the range 0 30 is selected to estimate the effect of θ e on the mel of omni max anchors figs 4 j and 5 j demonstrate that the mel is sensitive to the loading angle at seafloor with increasing value of θ e the mel increases rapidly the variables that have a major impact on the mel are selected to explicitly express the mel which can be a function of following nondimensional parameters 19 z m e l b g t b e n b e p b c f b μ s u 0 γ s b k γ a n c α sin θ e where γ s and γ a are the submerged soil weight and the submerged anchor weight respectively the nondimensional parameters may have positive or negative impacts on the mel as analyzed above in detail which are fitted by nonlinear regressive analyses a unified explicit expression of the mel for both sepla and omni max anchor is finally derived as 20 z m e l b c 1 s u 0 γ s b c 2 c f μ c 3 b c 4 k γ a c 5 t b c 6 e p b c 7 n c c 8 α c 9 e c 10 e n b e c 11 sin θ e c 12 where c 1 c 12 are coefficients whose values are different for seplas and omni max anchors as listed in table 6 comparing with the data from theoretical solutions to the mel values of the coefficient of determination r 2 of eq 20 reach 0 94 and 0 93 for seplas and omni max anchors respectively indicating the accuracy and reliability of the fitted formula 4 comparative study in order to examine the veracity and reliability of the unified explicit formula i e eq 20 all data available from publications are collected to perform comparative studies for both seplas and omni max anchors 4 1 sepla 4 1 1 comparison with experimental results of gaudin et al 2006 the centrifuge model tests of seplas in clay was performed by gaudin et al 2006 to investigate the mel of seplas at 45 inclined loading at the seafloor the model anchor in tests adopted the model scale of 1 145 which can be converted into a prototype square plate anchor with the width b of 5 075m the geometric parameters of the anchor and the calculation parameters except μ and c f as listed in table 7 were all proposed by gaudin et al 2006 due to the anchor line of wires in the tests the mean value 0 2 is adopted for μ in calculation according to the range 0 1 0 3 recommended by dnv 2000 for the parameters of the anchor line e n 1 for wires degenkamp and dutta 1989 and d 0 319 m according to gaudin et al 2006 the mean value 10 8 is adopted for n c l according to the range 7 6 14 liu et al 2012 thus the parameter c f is calculated as 3 45m the reconsolidation period and the caisson extraction methods were taken into account in the experimental cases in which st and lt denote the short term and the long term of retrieval period for soil disturbance respectively ve denotes the vented extraction and pe denotes the reverse pumping extraction soil reconsolidation caused by reconsolidation time and installation methods had significant effects on the mechanical properties of clay and the anchor capacity as observed from table 7 for the cases of ve st pe st ve lt and pe lt the relative errors of predictions are 10 9 17 8 13 4 and 49 3 respectively the mean relative error of predictions is 22 8 it is noted that the predictions of ve cases are better than those of pe cases the worst prediction is for the case pe lt in which the soil properties were significantly disturbed and the values of soil parameters in table 7 could not fully characterize the disturbed soil 4 1 2 comparison with experimental results of o loughlin et al 2006 o loughlin et al 2006 reported the effects of different eccentricity ratios e n b of the square and strip anchors on the mel of seplas in vertical centrifuge tests the model anchor in tests adopted the scale of 1 100 which can be converted into a prototype plate anchor with the width b of 3m the calculation parameters and geometric parameters of the anchor are listed in table 8 which were all proposed by o loughlin et al 2006 except n c α μ and c f n c 9 was recommended by song et al 2006 the mean value 0 4 is selected for α according to the range 0 3 0 5 gaudin et al 2006 due to the anchor line of wires in the tests the mean value 0 2 is adopted for μ according to the range 0 1 0 3 recommended by dnv 2000 for the parameters of the anchor line e n 1 for wires degenkamp and dutta 1989 the mean value 10 8 is adopted for n c l according to the range 7 6 14 liu et al 2012 and the mean value 0 175m is adopted for d according to the range 0 05 0 3m murff et al 2005 gaudin et al 2006 thus the parameter c f is calculated as 1 89m seven experimental cases with e b 0 17 1 5 and l b 1 and 2 67 were performed as listed in detail in table 8 the experimental cases are also predicted by the present formula and other two empirical formulae song et al 2009 wang et al 2011 as presented in table 8 as observed from table 8 relative to the measured results the present formula generally performs best among all prediction formulae the mean relative errors of the seven cases from the present formula the formula of song et al 2009 and the formula of wang et al 2011 are 18 9 33 5 and 32 1 respectively although the increased accuracy of predictions is confirmed in most cases it does not mean that the present formula can produce a good result for every case 4 1 3 comparison with experimental results of gaudin et al 2009 the centrifuge model tests in normally consolidated clay were performed by gaudin et al 2009 to investigate the mel of seplas under inclined loading the scale of the model anchor is 1 100 and then the prototype anchor width is 2m for the anchor with padeye eccentricity e 0 25 b four cases with different drag angles were designed as listed in table 9 except n c α μ and c f all geometric and calculation parameters in table 9 were proposed by gaudin et al 2009 n c 9 was recommended by song et al 2006 the mean value 0 4 is selected for α according to the range 0 3 0 5 gaudin et al 2006 due to the anchor line of wires in the tests the mean value 0 2 is adopted for μ according to the range 0 1 0 3 recommended by dnv 2000 for the parameters of the anchor line e n 1 for wires degenkamp and dutta 1989 the mean value 10 8 is adopted for n c l according to the range 7 7 14 liu et al 2012 and the mean value 0 175m is adopted for d according to the range 0 05 0 3m murff et al 2005 gaudin et al 2006 thus the parameter c f is calculated as 1 89m because there is a case of under vertical loading this case is also used in a comparative study with the formulae of song et al 2009 and wang et al 2011 it is observed from table 9 that the predictions from the present formula generally agree with the experimental data with the mean relative error of 13 3 in the vertical loading case which is the only case that the other two formulae can apply to the relative error of the present formula is 9 9 which is higher than that of song et al 2009 but lower than that of wang et al 2011 4 2 omni max anchor 4 2 1 comparison with plastic model results of liu et al 2016 liu et al 2016 performed plastic limit analyses based on the plastic yield envelope to investigate the mel of omni max anchors the anchor length b is 9 2m the geometric and calculation parameters of the anchor except n c μ and c f are all proposed by liu et al 2016 as listed in table 10 n c 13 7 is obtained through subtracting the influence of friction and gravity from the total bearing capacity factor provided by liu et al 2016 α 1 is adopted because the soil anchor interface was treated as completely rough in the model of liu et al 2016 due to the anchor line of wires in the analyses the mean value 0 2 is adopted for μ according to the range 0 1 0 3 recommended by dnv 2000 as for the anchor line parameter c f the value of 3 12 was recommended by han et al 2018 in the comparison with liu et al 2016 hence c f 3 12 is adopted in the present study the mel of the reference point δ z r k in plastic model cases was 0 22m below the anchor centroid which can be derived from the mel with the centroid z m e l as the reference point 21 δ z r k b z m e l b e c b 1 cos θ o where e c 0 22 m is the distance from the anchor centroid to the soil resistance center parallel to the shaft through eq 21 the mel results of the present work can be transformed into the mel results adopted in liu et al 2016 table 10 lists the analytical results from liu et al 2016 and the predictions from the present formula and zhao and liu 2017 the mean relative errors of predictions from the present formula and zhao and liu 2017 are 16 9 and 42 8 respectively in general the present formula can produce a prediction with higher accuracy than the formula of zhao and liu 2017 4 2 2 comparison with numerical results of zhao and liu 2017 the cel numerical analysis was performed by zhao and liu 2017 to study the trajectory and the mel of omni max anchors in clay the anchor length b is 9 2m the reference point δ z a k of the mel of omni max anchors in numerical cases was the anchor shackle which can be derived from the mel with the centroid as the reference point z m e l 22 δ z a k b z m e l b e p b e n b cos θ o e p b sin θ o nine numerical cases with the control velocity v c 1 m s which were regarded as in a quasi static state were analyzed by zhao and liu 2017 as listed in table 11 the nine cases are also predicted by the present formula and the formula of zhao and liu 2017 as also presented in table 11 in which the geometric and calculation parameters were all proposed by zhao and liu 2017 except n c the values of n c are obtained through subtracting the influence of friction and gravity from the total bearing capacity factor provided by zhao and liu 2017 as observed from table 11 both the present formula and the formula of zhao and liu 2017 can produce a satisfactory prediction with the mean relative error of 10 6 for the former and 8 8 for the latter however the present formula produces relatively even results with the maximum relative error of 21 9 while for the formula of zhao and liu 2017 the maximum relative error reaches 45 1 4 2 3 comparison with experimental results of liu et al 2018 the model test with a scale of 1 100 was conducted by liu et al 2018 in lightly overconsolidated clay to investigate the keying process of omni max anchors the model anchor was converted to a prototype with the length b of 9 05m the test result as well as the geometric parameters are listed in table 12 the test case is also predicted by the present formula and the formula of zhao and liu 2017 as also presented in table 12 in which the values of the calculation parameters were all proposed by liu et al 2018 except c f n c and α the value of c f can be obtained according to the information of n c l e n and d liu et al 2018 the value of n c is obtained through subtracting the influence of friction and gravity from the total bearing capacity factor provided by liu et al 2018 the value of α was recommended as 0 3 by zhao and liu 2017 it is observed from table 12 that the present formula produces a closer prediction than the formula of zhao and liu 2017 with the relative error of 26 7 it is noted that the padeye eccentricity and padeye offset are not considered as influential parameters in the formula of zhao and liu 2017 this may explain why predictions from the formula of zhao and liu 2017 agree better with the numerical results in section 4 2 2 from which this formula was fitted while for the other cases with different padeye eccentricities and offsets the accuracy of predictions usually reduces from this formula on the other hand it should be pointed out that an extra parameter is taken into account in the formula of zhao and liu 2017 i e the loading velocity if the loading rate becomes a prominent factor and has to be reckoned in this formula would be irreplaceable 4 3 comprehensive evaluation of different formulae in this section several statistical performance indicators are utilized to evaluate different formulae in predicting the mel of anchors including the mean absolute error mae the root mean square error rmse the mean μ the standard deviation of the predicted to measured values σ the coefficient of determination r 2 and the a20 index these indicators are expressed by alkroosh et al 2020 alzabeebee 2020 alzabeebee and chapman 2020 23 mae 1 n 1 n d

other available methods n is the number of cases and mp20 denotes the number of predictions within the error range of 20 fig 6 presents the calculated results of these indicators in which the formulae of zhao and liu 2017 for omni max anchors song et al 2009 for seplas and wang et al 2011 for seplas are denoted by formula 1 formula 2 and formula 3 respectively the present unified formula for both seplas and omni max anchors is denoted by formula 4 as reported earlier formula 1 can only predict the mel of omni max anchors and formulae 2 and 3 can only predict the mel of the seplas under vertical loading thus the number of cases n is 16 for formula 1 as indicated from tables 8 and 10 12 for formulae 2 and 3 as indicated from tables 8 and 9 however the present unified formula can apply to both seplas and omni max anchors thus all cases in tables 7 12 are collected to calculate the statistical performance indicators and the number of cases is 31 for formula 4 it is demonstrated from fig 6a and b that the mel with the lowest error is predicted by formula 1 and the error from formula 4 is lower than those from formulae 2 and 3 fig 6 c shows that the mean μ from formula 4 is closest to the optimal value of 1 fig 6 d indicates that the standard deviation σ from formula 4 is the lowest compared to other formulae meaning that the deviation between the predictions from formula 4 and the measured data is the lowest fig 6 e shows that values of the coefficient of determination r 2 from formulae 2 4 are larger than 0 9 while the value from formula 4 is closest to 1 in terms of the ratio of the predictions with the error equal to or lower than 20 fig 6 f demonstrates that value of the a20 index from formula 4 is the highest compared to other formulae in general the comprehensive evaluation by analyzing the statistical performance indicators confirms the adaptability and accuracy of the present unified formula in predicting the mel of both seplas and omni max anchors 5 concluding remarks the present work aims to develop a unified explicit formula for predicting the mel of both seplas and omni max anchors based on the mechanical mechanism and kinematic property of anchors the mechanical models at the mel are established for both seplas and omni max anchors which take into account all necessary influential parameters including the anchor geometry the interactional property the soil condition the anchor line property and the applied loading however the mechanical models which are presented by implicit sets of equations cannot be directly adopted to calculate the mel therefore a great effort has been made to derive a unified explicit formula of the mel from the mechanical models through systematic parametric studies and nonlinear regressive analyses some remarks on using the developed formula i e eq 20 are summarized as follows 1 to correctly use eq 20 for the prediction purpose the key is to reasonably choose the values of different parameters which are all common parameters in offshore geotechnical engineering and come from the anchor geometry width of the sepla or length of the omni max anchor b thickness or fin width t padeye eccentricity e n and padeye offset e p the anchor line property constant multiplier c f the interactional property end bearing capacity factor n c adhesion factor α and frictional coefficient μ the clay property shear strength at the seafloor s u 0 and shear strength gradient k and the applied loading loading angle at the seafloor θ e for a specific engineering application the parameters from the anchor geometry the anchor line property e n and d the clay property and the applied loading are usually clear therefore more uncertainties in determining the values of parameters would come from the interactional property n c α and μ and the partial anchor line property n c l if users are not certain to determine the values of n c n c l α and μ by themselves based on earlier studies of these parameters whose values generally vary in a range the mean value in this range is recommended for predictions values around the mean value are also recommended to examine the sensitivity and effects of the parameters 2 although eq 20 is more complex in form than the formulae of song et al 2009 and wang et al 2011 for seplas and the formula of zhao and liu 2017 for omni max anchors it takes into account all necessary parameters that affect the mel of seplas and omni max anchors thus it would be more practical for engineering which faces the challenge of complexities and varieties of the nature this may basically explain why the developed formula performs best in most cases than other formulae as demonstrated in the comparative studies 3 although eq 20 is developed to predict the mel of seplas and omni max anchors its application is not limited to a specific sepla or omni max anchor due to that the mel is a key index for design and engineering practice of anchors by changing the values of different parameters such as the anchor geometry much work can be done on the design and optimization of deepwater anchors and by changing the values of other parameters such as the anchor line property and the applied loading different installation methods could be tried and compared in this way the developed formula would play a more important role than only in predicting the mel of

20363,deepwater anchors typically the suction embedded plate anchor sepla and the omni max anchor would encounter the phenomenon of embedment loss after initial penetration which remarkably reduces

systems served for different applications of floating structures in deep waters they are generally classified according to the installation way typically the suction anchor the drag embedment plate anchor the suction embedded plate anchor sepla and the gravity installed anchor gia the pullout capacity and the kinematic property of the anchor are directly affected by the installation way and the structural characteristic of the anchor and are persistently challenging researches due to the complexity and variety of anchors although different in both installation way and structure an inreversible embedment loss after initial penetration of the anchor can be observed for the sepla and the omni max anchor a type of gias which remarkably reduces the pullout capacity and affects the subsequent behavior of the anchor due to importance and particularity the maximum embedment loss mel becomes a key index for design and engineering practice of seplas and omni max anchors earlier studies on the mel of seplas were performed by field tests wilde et al 2001 centrifuge tests song et al 2006 gaudin et al 2006 o loughlin et al 2006 gaudin et al 2009 plastic limit analyses yang et al 2012 cassidy et al 2012 and large deformation finite element analyses yu et al 2009 song et al 2009 wang et al 2011 zhao et al 2016 several parameters were regarded as influential ones in the centrifuge studies including the anchor geometry the padeye eccentricity and the angle of the anchor line at seafloor based on numerical analyses song et al 2009 proposed an empirical formula for predicting the mel of seplas under vertical pullout loading which takes into account the padeye eccentricity the thickness and area of the plate anchor the net moment acting on the anchor under initial vertical loading and the undrained shear strength at the initial embedment depth wang et al 2011 also recommended an empirical formula based on numerical analyses except the form of expression the difference between the two formulae is that the latter does not introduce the net moment at the initial position but directly reflects the other three factors that affect the embedment loss however both of the formulae cannot apply to the inclined pullout loading limiting the applicability of the formulae to more general loading conditions compared to seplas few studies were performed on the mel of omni max anchors plastic limit analyses wei et al 2015 liu et al 2016 han et al 2018 proved that the soil strength the padeye eccentricity ratio the loading angle at seafloor and the anchor line parameters are significant to the trajectory and mel of omni max anchors based on numerical analyses using the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel technique zhao and liu 2017 proposed an empirical formula for predicting the mel of omni max anchors which takes into account the installation mooring line property the loading angle at seafloor the loading velocity and the clayey soil property kim and hossain 2017 also adopted cel numerical analyses and proved that the mel of omni max anchors is related to the padeye offset ratio and the loading angle at the shackle without taking the anchor line into account actually the parameters of anchor lines affect the loading angle at the shackle resulting in an important impact on the mel as demonstrated by zhao and liu 2017 although different methods could analyze the effects of various parameters on the mel of anchors only the empirical formula is easier in usage and can produce a fast and quantitative result this is why many researchers tried to develop empirical formulae however existing formulae fail to account for all necessary parameters that affect the mel such as the inclined loading angle and the anchor line parameters for seplas and the padeye offset ratio for omni max anchors unfortunately there is much space to improve the prediction accuracy for the formulae of both seplas and omni max anchors these weaken the rationality and applicability of the formulae in engineering analyses and applications the present work aims to develop a unified explicit formula for calculating the mel of both seplas and omni max anchors different from existing formulae which were all obtained from numerical results the present formula is basically derived from mechanism analyses and theoretical models and hence has the ability to account for all necessary parameters that affect the mel based on the kinematic characteristics of the anchor at the mel the mechanical equilibrium equation is established to reflect the mechanical mechanism of the anchor at the mel the coupling effects among the anchor the anchor line and the clayey seabed are considered in constructing the model at the mel through systematic parametric studies of the theoretical model the regularity of the mel varying with the parameters is analyzed the data from the theoretical model are then fitted by the nonlinear regressive method to obtain a unified explicit formula for calculating the mel of both seplas and omni max anchors finally comparative studies for the two types of anchors are performed to examine the effectiveness and veracity of the developed formula 2 mechanical models for the mel in this section the mechanical models at the mel will be established for both seplas and omni max anchors the centroid of the anchor is considered as the reference point and the mel of the anchor z m e l is defined as the difference between the initial embedment depth h 0 and the embedment depth when reaching the mel z c of the reference point the anchor may present comprehensive behaviors in the seabed due to complicated loadings which can be divided into keying pulling out and diving for a sepla keying means the rotation of the anchor around a rotational center pulling out means the movement of the anchor perpendicular to the plate and diving means the movement of the anchor along the plate peng and liu 2019 in the present work correctly describing the three behaviors and corresponding conditions is the basis of the mechanical models at the mel for both seplas and omni max anchors 2 1 sepla when a sepla just reaches the mel the anchor meets two conditions 1 the anchor is in the critical state that changes from keying to pulling out and 2 the applied loading at the shackle is approximately perpendicular to the plate wilde et al 2001 gaudin et al 2006 o loughlin et al 2006 as illustrated in fig 1 a the mechanical model when the anchor stays in keying or in pulling out is shown in fig 2 in which point a denotes the anchor t a and m a denote the tension of applied loading at the shackle and the loading force moment respectively f b and f s denote the total end bearing and the total shear force in the direction of pulling out respectively and m s denote the total end bearing moment and the total shear moment respectively w and m w denote the submerged anchor weight and the total gravity moment respectively θ a and θ a h denote the loading angles at the shackle relative to the plate and the horizontal respectively θ o denotes the orientation of the plate relative to the horizontal which satisfies θ a h θ o θ a l c is the distance from the rear of the fluke to the intersection between the applied loading and the fluke and l k is the distance from the rear of the fluke to the rotational center of the anchor according to the force equilibrium and the moment equilibrium for keying and pulling out of the anchor the equilibrium equations can be established as 1 t a 1 l c m b m s m w keying t a f b f s w sin θ a h pulling out based on the bearing capacity formula proposed by skempton 1951 the total end bearing f b and the total shear force f s acting on the sepla can be expressed as 2 f b n c s u a b 1 a b 2 f s α s u a s 1 a s 2 a s 3 a s 4 where n c is the end bearing capacity factor α is the adhesion factor a b 1 a b 2 and a s 1 a s 4 are effective end bearing areas and effective shear areas of the sepla under pulling out respectively as listed in table 1 and s u is the undrained shear strength of clay expressed by s u s u 0 k z c in which s u 0 is the undrained shear strength at seafloor and k is the gradient of undrained shear strength with depth based on the previous study of peng and liu 2019 m b and m s are expressed by 3 m b n k s u a b 1 l b 1 a b 2 l b 2 a b 3 l b 3 m s α s u a s 1 l s 1 a s 2 l s 2 a s 3 l s 3 a s 4 l s 4 a s 5 l s 5 where a b 1 a b 3 are effective end bearing areas of the sepla under keying and l b 1 l b 3 are the corresponding moment arms for a b 1 a b 3 respectively a s 1 a s 5 are effective shear areas of the sepla under keying and l s 1 l s 5 are the corresponding moment arms for a s 1 a s 5 respectively and n k is the coefficient of soil resistance under keying expressed by n k 6 28 27 8 l k l f 2 2 l f 2 peng and liu 2019 in which l f herein is identical to the plate width b the value of l k is determined by the least force principle proposed by peng and liu 2019 more details of the method can be found in this reference some coefficients mentioned above are listed in table 2 where l s denotes the shank length l b denotes the distance from the rear of the plate to the plate shank connection point and θ s denotes the shank angle note that the expressions of f b f s m b and m s all contain the parameter s u by introducing the parameters η f f b f s s u and η m m b m s s u l c eq 1 can be rewritten as 4 t a s u 0 k z c η m w sin θ a h w s l s 2 l c cos θ a h keying t a s u 0 k z c η f w sin θ a h pulling out where w w a w s in which w a is the submerged plate weight and w s is the submerged shank weight therefore the unknown variables θ a h and t a are derived from eq 4 as 5 θ a h cos 1 ξ s u 0 k z c t a s u 0 k z c η f w 1 ξ 2 s u 0 k z c 2 where ξ 2 l c η f η m w s l s due to the anchor movement θ a h and t a would change with the embedment depth and cause a significant impact on the anchor behavior at the mel the chain equation of neubecker and randolph 1995 is introduced to reflect the interaction between the anchor line and the anchor which is expressed by 6 t a 1 μ 2 e μ θ a h θ cos θ μ sin θ θ e θ a h 0 z a c f s u d z where μ is the frictional coefficient c f e n d n c l in which n c l is the bearing capacity factor for the anchor line d is the diameter of the anchor line and e n is the multiplier of effective width in the normal direction to the anchor line θ e is the loading angle relative to the horizontal at seafloor and z a is the embedment depth of the shackle which satisfies z a z c e n cos θ o e p sin θ o where e n and e p are the padeye eccentricity normal to the shaft and padeye offset parallel to the shaft of the anchor respectively for the mechanical model of sepla fig 2 e p 0 and θ o 90 θ a h and thus z a z c e n sin θ a h then the implicit set of equations of z c is listed below 7 t a 1 μ 2 e μ θ a h θ cos θ μ sin θ θ e θ a h 0 z

the behavior of keying and the loss of embedment depth of omni max anchors are similar to those of seplas as illustrated in fig 1 b however the anchor possesses a truly three dimensional structure composed of one shaft and six fins which affects the soil resistance and the kinematic behavior of the anchor besides when the omni max anchor just reaches the mel it changes from keying to translating in a synthetical movement direction of diving and pulling out for the omni max anchor diving means the movement of the anchor along the shaft and pulling out means the movement of the anchor perpendicular to the shaft the differences above should be specially addressed in constructing the mechanical model of omni max anchors when the omni max anchor just reaches the mel it satisfies two conditions 1 the anchor stays in a critical state from keying to translating in a synthetical movement direction of diving and pulling out liu et al 2016 zhao and liu 2017 and 2 the applied loading at the shackle of the anchor is almost perpendicular to the anchor shaft shelton 2007 the mechanical model of the omni max anchor at the mel is illustrated in fig 3 when the anchor reaches the mel the equilibrium equation of keying is established with the condition of zero resultant moment and the equilibrium equation of translating is established in the synthetical movement direction θ m h as expressed by 9 t a 1 l c sin θ a m b m s m w keying t a 1 cos θ a h θ m h f b f s w sin θ m h translating where θ a denotes the loading angle at the shackle to the anchor shaft and θ m h denotes the movement direction or angle of translating to the horizontal the value of θ m h is positive θ m h 0 when the direction is above the horizontal the total end bearing f b and total shear force f s are expressed by 10 f b n c s u a b 1 sin θ m a b 3 cos θ m a b 4 sin θ s θ m f s α s u a s 1 sin θ m a s 2 cos θ s θ m a s 3 a s 4 a s 5 cos θ m where a b 1 a b 3 and a b 4 are effective end bearing areas and a s 1 a s 5 are effective shear areas of the anchor under translating as listed in table 1 and θ m is the movement angle of translating to the anchor shaft which satisfies θ m θ o θ m h the total end bearing moment m b and the total shear moment m s acting on the anchor are related to l k l s and l b based on the previous study of peng and liu 2019 m b and m s can be further expressed as following if l k l b l s cos θ s there is 11 1 m b n k s u a b 1 l b 1 a b 2 l b 2 a b 3 l b 3 m s α s u a s 1 l s 1 a s 2 l s 2 a s 3 l s 3 a s 4 l s 4 if l b l s cos θ s l k l b there is 11 2 m b n k s u a b 1 l b 1 a b 2 l b 2 a b 4 l b 4 a b 5 l b 5 m s α s u a s 1 l s 1 a s 2 l s 2 a s 3 l s 3 a s 6 l s 6 a s 7 l s 7 if l k l b there is 11 3 m b n k s u a b 1 l b 1 a b 2 l b 2 a b 3 l b 3 m s α s u a s 1 l s 1 a s 2 l s 2 a s 3 l s 3 a s 4 l s 4 where a b 1 a b 5 are effective end bearing areas and l b 1 l b 5 are the corresponding moment arms of the anchor under keying respectively a s 1 a s 4 and a s 6 a s 7 are effective shear areas and l s 1 l s 4 and l s 6 l s 7 are the corresponding moment arms of the anchor under keying respectively and n k is the coefficient of soil resistance under keying expressed by n k 6 28 27 8 l k l f 2 2 l f 2 peng et al 2016 in which l f is the anchor length and herein denoted by b for omni max anchors as for seplas the coefficients mentioned in eq 11 are listed in table 2 the parameter s u is a common multiplier in the expressions of f b f s m b and m s and thus the combination coefficients of soil resistance under keying and translating η f and η m can be expressed as η f f b f s s u cos θ a h θ m h and η m m b m s s u l c sin θ a eq 9 can be further expressed as 12 t a s u 0 k z c η m m w 1 l c sin θ a keying t a s u 0 k z c η f w sin θ m h cos θ a h θ m h translating the loading angle at the shackle relative to the shaft θ a is a key parameter data from zhao and liu 2017 as listed in table 3 demonstrated that the maximum value of θ a was approximately 85 when the anchor reached the mel based on the results of θ a varying with the horizontal displacement of the shackle zhao and liu 2017 illustrated that the anchor had reached the maximum pullout capacity before it reached the mel θ a 90 therefore the value of θ a at the mel could not be simply considered as 90 as for seplas and needs to be further determined according to the cases in table 3 the parameters c f and k have very small effects on θ a while θ e and h 0 b have significant effects on θ a thus a nonlinear fitting of θ a with the coefficient of determination r 2 0 98 can be obtained as 13 θ a 0 055 θ e h 0 b 1 642 85 54 the padeye offset ratio with the anchor centroid the reference point can be defined as 14 ω e p e n when the omni max anchor reaches the mel the angle of the anchor movement to the horizontal θ m h is also a key parameter which determines the direction of translating the values of θ m h extracted from the data of zhao and liu 2017 and liu et al 2016 are listed in table 3 obviously the value of θ m h is sensitive to the parameters h 0 b θ e k c f and ω the parameters k and c f both have a positive influence thus a nondimensional parameter k c f γ s b is combined considering the influential trend of each parameter the nonlinear fitting analyses result in a prediction formula of θ m h

cos 1 ζ w sin θ m h t a s u 0 k z c η f w sin θ m h cos θ a h θ m h where ζ m w l c sin θ a s u 0 k z c η f η m 1 then by combining the chain equation i e eq 6 the implicit set of equations of z c is listed below 17 t a 1 μ 2 e μ θ a h θ cos θ μ sin θ θ e θ a h 0 z a c f s u d z θ a h θ m h cos 1 ζ w sin θ m h t a s u 0 k z c η f w sin θ m h cos θ a h θ m h 3 unified explicit formula of mel the key to solve z m e l is to acquire the value of z c which could be obtained from the implicit sets of equations of z c i e eq 7 for seplas and eq 17 for omni max anchors then the nondimensional mel z m e l b can be expressed as 18 z m e l b h 0 b z c b z c f t e n e p c f μ θ e k s u 0 n c α where t denotes the plate thickness of seplas or the fin width of omni max anchors in order to obtain an explicit expression of mel parametric analyses are performed at first the effects of various parameters in the mechanical models of mel are not fully clear for both seplas and omni max anchors these parameters come from the anchor geometry length b thickness or fin width t padeye eccentricity e n and padeye offset e p the anchor line property constant multiplier c f the interactional property end bearing capacity factor n c adhesion factor α and frictional coefficient μ the clay property shear strength at seafloor s u 0 and shear strength gradient k and the applied loading loading angle at seafloor θ e therefore ten cases are hypothesized for both seplas and omni max anchors to investigate these parameters as listed in tables 4 and 5 variations of the mel with different parameters are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 for seplas the anchor models used in parametric analyses are rectangular plate anchors with shanks the dimension of seplas has a wide range according to previous investigations the plate width is set as 2m the anchor aspect ratio l b is set from 1 to 4 which was also adopted by o loughlin et al 2006 the anchor thickness ratio t b varies in the range 0 05 0 20 song et al 2009 gaudin et al 2009 the padeye eccentricity ratio e n b ranges in 0 15 1 5 o loughlin et al 2006 then according to the ratios as listed in table 4 the anchor length thickness and padeye eccentricity can be determined fig 4 a reveals that the anchor length l b has only a slight effect on the mel this is accordant with the observations in centrifuge tests o loughlin et al 2006 and fe analyses wang et al 2011 fig 4 b reveals that the mel presents an evident increasing trend with decreasing value of t b on account of the effects of anchor thickness on soil resistance and gravity the padeye eccentricity ratio e n b determines the position of the applied loading acting at the anchor which affects soil resistance and the embedment depth fig 4 c demonstrates that the mel decreases with increasing value of e b for omni max anchors the fin width t was reported as 1 96m by shelton 2007 and 1 89m by gaudin et al 2013 to investigate the effect of t on the mel the value of t is postulated in the range 1 76 2 26m as presented in fig 5 a the mel decreases with increasing value of t b the padeye eccentricity e n and the padeye offset e p are postulated in the ranges 1 7 2 44m shelton 2007 zimmerman et al 2009 gaudin et al 2013 liu et al 2016 and 0 69 0 99m kim and hossain 2017 liu et al 2018 respectively fig 5 b and c reveal that the mel presents an evident increasing trend with increasing values of e n and e p possible soil strength profiles are selected as listed in tables 4 and 5 for seplas the soil strength at seafloor s u 0 ranges in 0 30kpa liu et al 2010 and the soil strength gradient k varies in the range 0 7 1 5kpa m wang et al 2011 for omni max anchors the shear strength gradient k 0 6 3 3kpa m and the shear strength at seafloor s u 0 0 20kpa are adopted to evaluate their effects on the mel liu et al 2016 zhao and liu 2017 as illustrated in fig 4 d and e and fig 5 d and e the increase of soil strength results in an increasing mel the parameter of the anchor line i e the constant multiplier c f is selected as listed in tables 4 and 5 for seplas the value of n c l ranges in 7 6 14 liu et al 2012 and the diameter of the anchor line ranges in 0 05 0 3m murff et al 2005 gaudin et al 2006 thus the value of c f is determined in the range 0 38 4 2m for omni max anchors the parameter c f is postulated in the range 0 76 6 08 zhao and liu 2017 to investigate the effect of the anchor line on the mel curves in figs 4 f and 5 f demonstrate that the mel increases with increasing value of c f based on earlier studies for seplas the values of the end bearing capacity factor n c and the adhesion factor α range in 7 6 12 9 skempton 1951 song et al 2006 gaudin et al 2006 and 0 3 0 5 murff et al 2005 gaudin et al 2006 respectively for omni max anchors the bearing capacity factor n c varies in 7 5 14 3 skempton 1951 wei et al 2015 liu et al 2016 zhao and liu 2017 and the adhesion factor α is selected in the range 0 2 1 0 gaudin 2013 zhao and liu 2017 as observed in fig 4 g and h and fig 5 g and h the mel increases with increasing values of n c and α the value of μ was adopted in the range 0 4 0 6 neubecker and randolph 1995 dnv 2000 recommended μ 0 1 0 3 for wires and μ 0 6 0 8 for chains thus the range of μ is determined as 0 1 0 8 for both seplas and omni max anchors figs 4 i and 5 i demonstrate that the mel increases with decreasing value of μ the loading angle at seafloor θ e is selected in the range 0 90 to reflect possible loading conditions for seplas the omni max anchor has the diving trend with the value of θ e less than 30 as demonstrated by liu et al 2016 and zhao and liu 2017 hence the range 0 30 is selected to estimate the effect of θ e on the mel of omni max anchors figs 4 j and 5 j demonstrate that the mel is sensitive to the loading angle at seafloor with increasing value of θ e the mel increases rapidly the variables that have a major impact on the mel are selected to explicitly express the mel which can be a function of following nondimensional parameters 19 z m e l b g t b e n b e p b c f b μ s u 0 γ s b k γ a n c α sin θ e where γ s and γ a are the submerged soil weight and the submerged anchor weight respectively the nondimensional parameters may have positive or negative impacts on the mel as analyzed above in detail which are fitted by nonlinear regressive analyses a unified explicit expression of the mel for both sepla and omni max anchor is finally derived as 20 z m e l b c 1 s u 0 γ s b c 2 c f μ c 3 b c 4 k γ a c 5 t b c 6 e p b c 7 n c c 8 α c 9 e c 10 e n b e c 11 sin θ e c 12 where c 1 c 12 are coefficients whose values are different for seplas and omni max anchors as listed in table 6 comparing with the data from theoretical solutions to the mel values of the coefficient of determination r 2 of eq 20 reach 0 94 and 0 93 for seplas and omni max anchors respectively indicating the accuracy and reliability of the fitted formula 4 comparative study in order to examine the veracity and reliability of the unified explicit formula i e eq 20 all data available from publications are collected to perform comparative studies for both seplas and omni max anchors 4 1 sepla 4 1 1 comparison with experimental results of gaudin et al 2006 the centrifuge model tests of seplas in clay was performed by gaudin et al 2006 to investigate the mel of seplas at 45 inclined loading at the seafloor the model anchor in tests adopted the model scale of 1 145 which can be converted into a prototype square plate anchor with the width b of 5 075m the geometric parameters of the anchor and the calculation parameters except μ and c f as listed in table 7 were all proposed by gaudin et al 2006 due to the anchor line of wires in the tests the mean value 0 2 is adopted for μ in calculation according to the range 0 1 0 3 recommended by dnv 2000 for the parameters of the anchor line e n 1 for wires degenkamp and dutta 1989 and d 0 319 m according to gaudin et al 2006 the mean value 10 8 is adopted for n c l according to the range 7 6 14 liu et al 2012 thus the parameter c f is calculated as 3 45m the reconsolidation period and the caisson extraction methods were taken into account in the experimental cases in which st and lt denote the short term and the long term of retrieval period for soil disturbance respectively ve denotes the vented extraction and pe denotes the reverse pumping extraction soil reconsolidation caused by reconsolidation time and installation methods had significant effects on the mechanical properties of clay and the anchor capacity as observed from table 7 for the cases of ve st pe st ve lt and pe lt the relative errors of predictions are 10 9 17 8 13 4 and 49 3 respectively the mean relative error of predictions is 22 8 it is noted that the predictions of ve cases are better than those of pe cases the worst prediction is for the case pe lt in which the soil properties were significantly disturbed and the values of soil parameters in table 7 could not fully characterize the disturbed soil 4 1 2 comparison with experimental results of o loughlin et al 2006 o loughlin et al 2006 reported the effects of different eccentricity ratios e n b of the square and strip anchors on the mel of seplas in vertical centrifuge tests the model anchor in tests adopted the scale of 1 100 which can be converted into a prototype plate anchor with the width b of 3m the calculation parameters and geometric parameters of the anchor are listed in table 8 which were all proposed by o loughlin et al 2006 except n c α μ and c f n c 9 was recommended by song et al 2006 the mean value 0 4 is selected for α according to the range 0 3 0 5 gaudin et al 2006 due to the anchor line of wires in the tests the mean value 0 2 is adopted for μ according to the range 0 1 0 3 recommended by dnv 2000 for the parameters of the anchor line e n 1 for wires degenkamp and dutta 1989 the mean value 10 8 is adopted for n c l according to the range 7 6 14 liu et al 2012 and the mean value 0 175m is adopted for d according to the range 0 05 0 3m murff et al 2005 gaudin et al 2006 thus the parameter c f is calculated as 1 89m seven experimental cases with e b 0 17 1 5 and l b 1 and 2 67 were performed as listed in detail in table 8 the experimental cases are also predicted by the present formula and other two empirical formulae song et al 2009 wang et al 2011 as presented in table 8 as observed from table 8 relative to the measured results the present formula generally performs best among all prediction formulae the mean relative errors of the seven cases from the present formula the formula of song et al 2009 and the formula of wang et al 2011 are 18 9 33 5 and 32 1 respectively although the increased accuracy of predictions is confirmed in most cases it does not mean that the present formula can produce a good result for every case 4 1 3 comparison with experimental results of gaudin et al 2009 the centrifuge model tests in normally consolidated clay were performed by gaudin et al 2009 to investigate the mel of seplas under inclined loading the scale of the model anchor is 1 100 and then the prototype anchor width is 2m for the anchor with padeye eccentricity e 0 25 b four cases with different drag angles were designed as listed in table 9 except n c α μ and c f all geometric and calculation parameters in table 9 were proposed by gaudin et al 2009 n c 9 was recommended by song et al 2006 the mean value 0 4 is selected for α according to the range 0 3 0 5 gaudin et al 2006 due to the anchor line of wires in the tests the mean value 0 2 is adopted for μ according to the range 0 1 0 3 recommended by dnv 2000 for the parameters of the anchor line e n 1 for wires degenkamp and dutta 1989 the mean value 10 8 is adopted for n c l according to the range 7 7 14 liu et al 2012 and the mean value 0 175m is adopted for d according to the range 0 05 0 3m murff et al 2005 gaudin et al 2006 thus the parameter c f is calculated as 1 89m because there is a case of under vertical loading this case is also used in a comparative study with the formulae of song et al 2009 and wang et al 2011 it is observed from table 9 that the predictions from the present formula generally agree with the experimental data with the mean relative error of 13 3 in the vertical loading case which is the only case that the other two formulae can apply to the relative error of the present formula is 9 9 which is higher than that of song et al 2009 but lower than that of wang et al 2011 4 2 omni max anchor 4 2 1 comparison with plastic model results of liu et al 2016 liu et al 2016 performed plastic limit analyses based on the plastic yield envelope to investigate the mel of omni max anchors the anchor length b is 9 2m the geometric and calculation parameters of the anchor except n c μ and c f are all proposed by liu et al 2016 as listed in table 10 n c 13 7 is obtained through subtracting the influence of friction and gravity from the total bearing capacity factor provided by liu et al 2016 α 1 is adopted because the soil anchor interface was treated as completely rough in the model of liu et al 2016 due to the anchor line of wires in the analyses the mean value 0 2 is adopted for μ according to the range 0 1 0 3 recommended by dnv 2000 as for the anchor line parameter c f the value of 3 12 was recommended by han et al 2018 in the comparison with liu et al 2016 hence c f 3 12 is adopted in the present study the mel of the reference point δ z r k in plastic model cases was 0 22m below the anchor centroid which can be derived from the mel with the centroid z m e l as the reference point 21 δ z r k b z m e l b e c b 1 cos θ o where e c 0 22 m is the distance from the anchor centroid to the soil resistance center parallel to the shaft through eq 21 the mel results of the present work can be transformed into the mel results adopted in liu et al 2016 table 10 lists the analytical results from liu et al 2016 and the predictions from the present formula and zhao and liu 2017 the mean relative errors of predictions from the present formula and zhao and liu 2017 are 16 9 and 42 8 respectively in general the present formula can produce a prediction with higher accuracy than the formula of zhao and liu 2017 4 2 2 comparison with numerical results of zhao and liu 2017 the cel numerical analysis was performed by zhao and liu 2017 to study the trajectory and the mel of omni max anchors in clay the anchor length b is 9 2m the reference point δ z a k of the mel of omni max anchors in numerical cases was the anchor shackle which can be derived from the mel with the centroid as the reference point z m e l 22 δ z a k b z m e l b e p b e n b cos θ o e p b sin θ o nine numerical cases with the control velocity v c 1 m s which were regarded as in a quasi static state were analyzed by zhao and liu 2017 as listed in table 11 the nine cases are also predicted by the present formula and the formula of zhao and liu 2017 as also presented in table 11 in which the geometric and calculation parameters were all proposed by zhao and liu 2017 except n c the values of n c are obtained through subtracting the influence of friction and gravity from the total bearing capacity factor provided by zhao and liu 2017 as observed from table 11 both the present formula and the formula of zhao and liu 2017 can produce a satisfactory prediction with the mean relative error of 10 6 for the former and 8 8 for the latter however the present formula produces relatively even results with the maximum relative error of 21 9 while for the formula of zhao and liu 2017 the maximum relative error reaches 45 1 4 2 3 comparison with experimental results of liu et al 2018 the model test with a scale of 1 100 was conducted by liu et al 2018 in lightly overconsolidated clay to investigate the keying process of omni max anchors the model anchor was converted to a prototype with the length b of 9 05m the test result as well as the geometric parameters are listed in table 12 the test case is also predicted by the present formula and the formula of zhao and liu 2017 as also presented in table 12 in which the values of the calculation parameters were all proposed by liu et al 2018 except c f n c and α the value of c f can be obtained according to the information of n c l e n and d liu et al 2018 the value of n c is obtained through subtracting the influence of friction and gravity from the total bearing capacity factor provided by liu et al 2018 the value of α was recommended as 0 3 by zhao and liu 2017 it is observed from table 12 that the present formula produces a closer prediction than the formula of zhao and liu 2017 with the relative error of 26 7 it is noted that the padeye eccentricity and padeye offset are not considered as influential parameters in the formula of zhao and liu 2017 this may explain why predictions from the formula of zhao and liu 2017 agree better with the numerical results in section 4 2 2 from which this formula was fitted while for the other cases with different padeye eccentricities and offsets the accuracy of predictions usually reduces from this formula on the other hand it should be pointed out that an extra parameter is taken into account in the formula of zhao and liu 2017 i e the loading velocity if the loading rate becomes a prominent factor and has to be reckoned in this formula would be irreplaceable 4 3 comprehensive evaluation of different formulae in this section several statistical performance indicators are utilized to evaluate different formulae in predicting the mel of anchors including the mean absolute error mae the root mean square error rmse the mean μ the standard deviation of the predicted to measured values σ the coefficient of determination r 2 and the a20 index these indicators are expressed by alkroosh et al 2020 alzabeebee 2020 alzabeebee and chapman 2020 23 mae 1 n 1 n d

other available methods n is the number of cases and mp20 denotes the number of predictions within the error range of 20 fig 6 presents the calculated results of these indicators in which the formulae of zhao and liu 2017 for omni max anchors song et al 2009 for seplas and wang et al 2011 for seplas are denoted by formula 1 formula 2 and formula 3 respectively the present unified formula for both seplas and omni max anchors is denoted by formula 4 as reported earlier formula 1 can only predict the mel of omni max anchors and formulae 2 and 3 can only predict the mel of the seplas under vertical loading thus the number of cases n is 16 for formula 1 as indicated from tables 8 and 10 12 for formulae 2 and 3 as indicated from tables 8 and 9 however the present unified formula can apply to both seplas and omni max anchors thus all cases in tables 7 12 are collected to calculate the statistical performance indicators and the number of cases is 31 for formula 4 it is demonstrated from fig 6a and b that the mel with the lowest error is predicted by formula 1 and the error from formula 4 is lower than those from formulae 2 and 3 fig 6 c shows that the mean μ from formula 4 is closest to the optimal value of 1 fig 6 d indicates that the standard deviation σ from formula 4 is the lowest compared to other formulae meaning that the deviation between the predictions from formula 4 and the measured data is the lowest fig 6 e shows that values of the coefficient of determination r 2 from formulae 2 4 are larger than 0 9 while the value from formula 4 is closest to 1 in terms of the ratio of the predictions with the error equal to or lower than 20 fig 6 f demonstrates that value of the a20 index from formula 4 is the highest compared to other formulae in general the comprehensive evaluation by analyzing the statistical performance indicators confirms the adaptability and accuracy of the present unified formula in predicting the mel of both seplas and omni max anchors 5 concluding remarks the present work aims to develop a unified explicit formula for predicting the mel of both seplas and omni max anchors based on the mechanical mechanism and kinematic property of anchors the mechanical models at the mel are established for both seplas and omni max anchors which take into account all necessary influential parameters including the anchor geometry the interactional property the soil condition the anchor line property and the applied loading however the mechanical models which are presented by implicit sets of equations cannot be directly adopted to calculate the mel therefore a great effort has been made to derive a unified explicit formula of the mel from the mechanical models through systematic parametric studies and nonlinear regressive analyses some remarks on using the developed formula i e eq 20 are summarized as follows 1 to correctly use eq 20 for the prediction purpose the key is to reasonably choose the values of different parameters which are all common parameters in offshore geotechnical engineering and come from the anchor geometry width of the sepla or length of the omni max anchor b thickness or fin width t padeye eccentricity e n and padeye offset e p the anchor line property constant multiplier c f the interactional property end bearing capacity factor n c adhesion factor α and frictional coefficient μ the clay property shear strength at the seafloor s u 0 and shear strength gradient k and the applied loading loading angle at the seafloor θ e for a specific engineering application the parameters from the anchor geometry the anchor line property e n and d the clay property and the applied loading are usually clear therefore more uncertainties in determining the values of parameters would come from the interactional property n c α and μ and the partial anchor line property n c l if users are not certain to determine the values of n c n c l α and μ by themselves based on earlier studies of these parameters whose values generally vary in a range the mean value in this range is recommended for predictions values around the mean value are also recommended to examine the sensitivity and effects of the parameters 2 although eq 20 is more complex in form than the formulae of song et al 2009 and wang et al 2011 for seplas and the formula of zhao and liu 2017 for omni max anchors it takes into account all necessary parameters that affect the mel of seplas and omni max anchors thus it would be more practical for engineering which faces the challenge of complexities and varieties of the nature this may basically explain why the developed formula performs best in most cases than other formulae as demonstrated in the comparative studies 3 although eq 20 is developed to predict the mel of seplas and omni max anchors its application is not limited to a specific sepla or omni max anchor due to that the mel is a key index for design and engineering practice of anchors by changing the values of different parameters such as the anchor geometry much work can be done on the design and optimization of deepwater anchors and by changing the values of other parameters such as the anchor line property and the applied loading different installation methods could be tried and compared in this way the developed formula would play a more important role than only in predicting the mel of seplas and omni max anchors credit authorship contribution statement haixiao liu conceptualization methodology investigation writing review editing ke liang methodology formal analysis writing

20364,waves in the arabian gulf gulf are dominated by shamal winds during winter and early summer although wave characteristics in the gulf are broadly studied features associated with various wind systems are not explicitly covered especially in the exclusive economic zone eez of qatar in this study we analyzed the wave parameters measured off fuwairit north coast of qatar during 29 october 26 november 2019 to identify the features associated with different wind systems the analyses have been further extended to the gulf using the reanalysis waves obtained from the copernicus marine environment monitoring services cmems to describe the monthly seasonal and annual characteristics results indicate that nashi winds influence the east and northeast coasts of qatar with higher waves than those generated by shamal winds we find exceptional easterly nashi waves during march 2019 contributing to the highest monthly mean hs which is a deviation from the known long term wave climate of the gulf keywords waves off qatar arabian gulf nashi winds shamal winds shamal waves cmems reanalysis waves 1 introduction surface waves driven by the winds are one of the major controlling factors for the coastal dynamics for instance longshore current and sediment transport are highly influenced by nearshore wave transformation the activities such as design of coastal and offshore structures exploitation of conventional resources loading and unloading navigation and recreational activities are relied on accurate information of surface waves wave statistics derived from point measurements are generally used to describe the inherent features of waves in that region temporal and spatial analyses is usually carried out using wave model results or satellite observations though most of the studies in the indian ocean are for open ocean or coastal regions sirisha et al 2017 samiksha et al 2012 very few studies are carried out for the semi enclosed marginal seas langodan et al 2014 wave characteristics on marginal seas gained more attention in recent years particularly because of their links with dominant local regional features and global climate indices shanas et al 2017 the arabian persian gulf hereafter referred to as gulf is a semi enclosed sea connecting the arabian sea through the strait of hormuz and the sea of oman fig 1 the strait of hormuz is narrow with a minimum width of 39 km van dyke 2008 the central gulf is characterised by the exclusive economic zone eez of qatar in the south and the eez of iran in the north the eez of qatar is relatively wider off the east and north of qatar but very narrow off west of qatar north and east coasts of qatar are exposed to the complex dynamic interactions of the gulf with the arabian sea pous et al 2015 the topographic features of the gulf are complex bathymetry numerous small and big islands coral reefs seagrass meadows mangrove forests and mud sand flats khan et al 2002 the climatic features of the gulf are extreme hot summer moderate cold winter high evaporation weak precipitation shamal winds and dust storms the winds over the gulf predominantly varies between northwest nw to north n throughout the seasons while east e to southeast se winds prevail occasionally thoppil and hogan 2010 the strongest winds in the gulf are associated with shamal events notaro et al 2015 yu et al 2016 shamal events the unique weather phenomena over the arabian peninsula occur throughout the year but predominantly during winter and early summer perrone 1979 the summer shamal is caused by a steep pressure gradient formed between the northwest india low pressure and the eastern mediterranean sea high pressure while the winter shamal is associated with mid latitude disturbances moving from west to east the shamal periodicities are generally of two kinds shorter events of 24 36 h and longer events of 3 5 days based on their intensity and spatial distribution aboobacker et al 2011 the higher wind speeds during shamal events are observed in the northern and central arabian gulf liao and kaihatu 2016a the higher mean wind speed of the order of 5 9 m s during winter is observed in the central gulf whereas higher mean wind speed of the order of 4 9 m s during summer is in the northern gulf the annual mean wind speeds along the qatar coast varies between 3 0 and 5 0 m s whereas the 95thpercentile wind speed is between 8 0 and 12 0 m s patlakhas et al 2019 though winds are predominantly in the nw nnw direction sea land breezes from various directional sectors are also present when the regional wind systems weaken sandeepan et al 2018 the gulf being a semi enclosed sea waves in the gulf follows the prevailing wind patterns with relatively high impact during shamal events kamranazad 2013 the wider deflection in the orientation of the coastline adjacent to the strait of hormuz fig 1 prevents the long period swells from the arabian sea entering the gulf however interaction between young swells wind seas generated on either side of the strait of hormuz and the complex bottom topography may produce complex wave conditions near the gulf entrance the impact of such interaction may be minor as far as the wave climate of the central gulf is concerned when the sea of oman is treated as a closed boundary in the wave model the results indicate that waves coming from the sea of oman refracts and decays significantly around the strait of hormuz moeini et al 2013 therefore waves within the gulf are predominantly wind seas the mean wave periods tm are also reported to be between 1 5 and 5 0 s li et al 2020 waves in the central gulf are influenced by winds from both nw and se however dominated by nw winds vieira et al 2020 it has been identified that more energetic areas in the gulf are in the southern region off dubai where the extreme 99th percentile significant wave height hs is greater than 2 7 m and peak wave period tp is about 8 0 s during shamal dominated conditions the seasonal mean hs in the gulf is higher during winter up to 0 8 m than other seasons kamranzad 2018 the bahrain and qatar peninsulas cause sheltering effects on the predominant northwesterly waves thus significant reduction in hs occurs along the southwest and east coast of qatar vieira et al 2020 liao and kaihatu 2016a pointed out that the refraction causes 20 total energy deviation ted along the north eastern corner of qatar during winter in doha bay the waves from nw are under fetch limited conditions which result in low wave heights liao and kaihatu 2016b moreover occasionally developed easterly waves with relatively higher hs were identified along the east coast of qatar although previous studies provide a brief overview of the wave conditions in the gulf the systematic variations in wave parameters in the eez of qatar due to different wind systems are yet to be unravelled the present study aims at exploring the wave variabilities by analysing measured wave parameters off fuwairit north coast of qatar and numerical wave model results within the eez of qatar obtained from copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems fuwairit is a coastal village in qatar located in the municipality of ash shamal approximately 90 km north of doha fuwairit has a long stretch of beach with fine and white sand it is an important site for qatar s oil industry and coral reefs are not far from the measurement site it is a popular camping spot and a favourable site for kite surfers who come here on windy days fuwairit coastal area is exposed to the central gulf influenced by different wind wave and current systems and in the proximity to the dynamics of the central gulf the deployment of oceanographic equipment was carried out as a part of the ongoing physical oceanographic investigations in this region 2 data and methods waves measured off fuwairit fig 1 north coast of qatar has been anlayzed in this study the measurements have been carried out using seaguard recording current meter rcm and signature 1000 acoustic doppler current profiler adcp placed within a horizontal distance of 150 m distance between them the wave data were sampled at every 10 min interval the rcm was moored 2 m above the seabed during 29 october 26 november 2019 while the adcp was deployed in the seabed for a short period 29 october 01 november 2019 the water depth in the measurement location is 7 0 m we processed the non directional wave parameters hs and tp from the rcm while the directional wave parameters hs tp and mean wave direction mwd have been obtained from the adcp although the duration of measured data is short we find that the non directional wave parameters measured using adcp are consistent with those obtained from rcm moreover mwd obtained from the adcp has been used for the verification of wave direction obtained from reanalysis data as no other measured wave data could be obtained to incorporate in this study the accuracy of the pressure sensor in the rcm is 0 04 of the full scale output fso https www aanderaa com media pdfs seaguard rcm basic pdf the accuracies of hs and mwd in the adcp are 1 of

quality of the era5 product the spatial grid resolution of era5 winds is 30 km the era5 winds have a better accuracy compared to its predecessor era interim rivas and stoffelen 2019 the era5 winds were validated with in situ measurements in the gulf mahmoodi et al 2019 as well as along the east coast of qatar aboobacker et al 2020a we used the era5 winds in the present study to characterize the

ecwam ifs 38r2 computing code with dissipation terms developed by ardhuin et al 2010 where the model mean bathymetry is generated by using etopo2 national geophysical data center 2006 the wave spectrum is discretized in 24 directions and 30 frequencies starting from 0 035 hz to 0 58 hz in this study both 9 km and 22 km resolution wave model outputs during jan 2019 april 2020 have been used to characterize the waves in the eez of qatar the wave measurement location off fuwairit falls in a dry grid in 9 km resolution model while it falls in a wet grid in 22 km resolution model thus the validation of the cmems waves has been carried out using the latter however being relatively fine resolution we used the 9 km resolution outputs for a spatial analysis we find no significant difference among both the wave model results when the results are compared at an offshore location within the eez of qatar comparison is not shown it is worthy to note that the temporal and spatial resolutions of the cmems waves are adequate to describe the effects of regional wind systems on waves in the gulf however such resolutions may not capture the effects of waves generated by the local sea land breezes 3 results and discussion 3 1 wind climate in the eez of qatar the qatar peninsula and the offshore experience winds from various directions the northwesterly north northwesterly nw nnw winds are predominant along the north coast of qatar throughout the year in which the shamal winds are dominant fig 2 their relative contribution is higher during winter november april than summer may october the easterly to south southeasterly e to sse winds are more pronounced in winter which are influenced by the large scale ne monsoon winds in addition to regional winds local breezes are also found throughout the year in significant proportion sandeepan et al 2018 identified sea land breeze systems in qatar which causes diurnal variability in wind speeds especially in the onshore regions the percentage occurrence of winds off fuwairit is the highest from nnw 23 1 followed by nw 17 7 and n 7 8 while the lowest is from sw 1 7 in an annual cycle the wind speeds show high variability during winter driven by shamal and easterly winds fig 3 aboobacker et al 2020a showed that the monthly mean wind speeds along the north coast of qatar are the highest during february and the lowest during september the maximum wind speed of 16 3 m s identified in the year in consideration was associated with a strong easterly wind system occurred on 23 march 2019 this is a rare case when compared with the subsequent peaks in wind speeds which are mostly from the nw nnw directions the percentage occurrence of high winds above 10 m s is 8 6 whereas that of moderate winds between 5 and 10 m s 39 6 and low winds below 5 m s 51 8 fig 4 shows the snapshots of shamal and easterly winds in the eez of qatar during the wave measurement period here the shamal winds during the measurement period are predominantly from the nnw and of order of 8 12 m s with a decreasing intensity towards south the typical speeds of shamal winds in the gulf are generally 15 20 m s senafi and anis 2015 while a maximum speed of 22 m s were identified within the last 40 years aboobacker et al 2020b the annual occurrence of winds from the directional sector nw n is around 49 the easterly winds in the eez during the measurement period are typically of the order of 4 8 m s decreasing towards the land areas although the occurrence is relatively low less than 16 from the directional sector ene ese the easterly winds have high potential considering a longer fetch 350 450 km in the central and southern gulf and hence their impact along the east coast of qatar 3 2 observed variations in wave parameters there are typically two high wave conditions off fuwairit which are associated with i shamal winds and ii easterly winds fig 5 during the measurement period three shamal events namely shamal i 31 october 02 november shamal ii 05 07 november and shamal iii 20 21 november and two easterly wind events easterly i 10 11 november and easterly ii 16 18 november were identified the wind speeds during the pre shamal period were generally low and the directions were between e and s however during the active shamal events the hs and tp gradually increased in response to the increase in shamal wind speed in addition a gradual shift of wave direction from e to nnw nw has been noticed the maximum hs measured during shamal i shamal ii and shamal iii events are 1 23 m 1 32 m and 1 12 m respectively while the maximum tp are 6 3 s 6 7 s and 5 7 s respectively the maximum hs measured during easterly i and easterly ii events are 1 38 m and 1 68 m respectively while the maximum tp are 6 5 s and 6 9 s this indicates that the hs of easterly waves are higher than the shamal induced waves along the north coast of qatar during the measurement period this is because of the longer fetch available for the easterly waves while the fetch of shamal induced waves is very limited considering the proximity of the measurement location to the coast and geographical orientation of the coastline it is also obvious that the month november exhibits a relatively low potential shamal wind speeds compared to the peak winter shamals january march and summer shamals june 3 3 verification of cmems wave parameters wave parameters obtained from the cmems have been compared with the measurements off fuwairit fig 5b d the comparison shows that the cmems wave parameters match reasonably well with the measurements for easterly waves hs and tp are under estimated as shallow water processes are not well executed in the coarse model grid 22 km resolution which is a matter of concern for the shore normal propagating waves shamal waves are in the nnw direction which have a long fetch towards offshore until it reaches the uae coast thus in the measurement area it has a relatively lower attenuation compared to a shore normal propagating wave this resulted in a reasonably well comparison for waves in cmems model during peak shamal conditions the correlation coefficient bias root mean square error r m s e and scatter index between the measured and model hs are 0 88 0 05 m 0 17 m and 0 35 respectively the cmems tp is slightly under estimated the correlation coefficient bias r m s e and scatter index between the measured and model tp are 0 68 0 29 s 0 77 s and 0 18 respectively the mwd obtained from the cmems data matches reasonably well with that of adcp data within the limited data duration especially the directional shift associated with different wind systems has been well captured ravdas et al 2018 observed a good overall performance of cmems wave parameters in regional seas and our results are in consistent with their work thus we used this dataset to derive a qualitative description on the annual and seasonal variations of waves along the north coast of qatar 3 4 spatial patterns of shamal and easterly waves shamal waves are the strongest waves in the gulf with significant spatial variations fig 6 shows the snapshots of the shamal waves in the gulf during 01 02 march 2019 when the shamal wind prevails the height of the nw waves increases in the northern gulf while the pre existing waves ne to sw in the southern gulf retreats depending on the intensity and duration of shamal winds the shamal waves are further evolved and propagated up to the southern gulf which often cross the strait of hormuz in a previous study aboobacker et al 2011 identified the shamal winds and waves prevailing in the sea of oman and the arabian sea the north and northeast boundaries of the eez of qatar experiences higher shamal waves hs of the order of 3 4 m in this case however the highest shamal waves could be observed in the southern gulf especially off the west coast of uae with hs of the order of 3 8 m this is in consistent with the findings of vieira et al 2020 along the coast of qatar the shamal waves are typically in the nnw direction the west and southeast coasts of qatar experiences relatively lower shamal waves hs 2 0 m due to topographical features as well as fetch limitations the time series of wave parameters off fuwairit extracted from cmems for the year 2019 indicate that there are several peaks with hs higher than 1 5 m fig 7 the associated peak wave periods are between 6 0 and 8 5 s most of these peaks are from the nnw while a few are from the e the higher nnw waves are due to shamal winds while the higher e waves are due to easterly wind events the shamal induced maximum hs is 2 12 m and the corresponding tp is 7 0 s the easterly winds are either due to the ne monsoon winds or by the nashi winds villiers and heerden 2011 the nashi winds are the stronger dusty and dry northeasterly winds originating from iran during winter which enter into the gulf through the southern coast of iran near the strait of hormuz as northeasterlies these winds further flow as easterlies during their propagation in the central gulf and as southeasterlies in the northern gulf the mechanism of the formation of nashi winds in iran are similar to that of south asian subtropical low level jet identified near the iranian borders of the afghanistan and pakistan anoop et al 2019 as they are in conjunction with each other the easterly winds in the gulf are often modified by the influence of low pressure systems developed over the mediterranean and the northern arabian peninsula the highest hs 2 3 m off fuwairit occurred on 25 march 2019 was due to such easterly event during which the tp was around 8 0 8 5 s this indicates that the north coast of qatar experiences large waves from the east although their occurrences are relatively low dry and warm southeasterly winds namely kaus with moderate speeds are also observed in the gulf during winter rao et al 2001 the wave rose plot fig 8 clearly depicts the impact of these wind systems shamal nashi and kaus on wave generation in the gulf especially along the north coast of qatar the occurrence of higher waves due to these wind sources is more during winter than summer a few wave systems with lower hs are also found from various directions some of which may be attributed to sea land breezes identified within the eez of qatar sandeepan et al 2018 fig 9 shows the snapshots of the wave vectors during an easterly wind event the early generation of easterly waves is near the strait of hormuz within the limited fetch resulting in relatively small hs of the order of 1 0 1 8 m fig 9a as the fetch expands and wind intensity increases the central and northern gulf dominate with higher hs of the order of 3 3 m and 3 8 m respectively fig 9b d in comparison with shamal waves fig 6 the easterly waves have higher hs along the east coast of qatar up to 2 6 m although their relative occurrence is low the processes occurring in the nearshore regions are not only by the waves but also by the currents induced by the tide driven flows and regional scale circulations these will have significant implications in physical and biogeochemical processes along the east coast of qatar a more quantitative assessment of winds and waves using fine resolution models such as wrf and swan respectively are required to capture the local effects to a good extent and thus to enhance the understanding of biogeochemical interactions 3 5 annual seasonal and monthly distribution of hs in the eez of qatar 3 5 1 annual mean and maximum the annual mean hs in the eez of qatar is of the order of 0 2 0 7 m where the highest waves are observed in the northeast offshore boundary fig 10 a earlier studies reported that the long term highest mean hs in the gulf is along the central strip of the gulf that includes the north and northeast boundaries of the eez of qatar kamranzad 2018 mahmoodi et al 2019 the west and southeast coasts of qatar have lower hs 0 4 m due to shallow depths and shielding orography of the peninsular qatar and bahrain in the central gulf which attenuate prevent large waves entering in these regions the annual mean hs and tp off fuwairit are 0 46 m and 3 9 s respectively this indicates that northern coast of qatar experiences short period waves with moderate heights during most part of the year the annual maximum hs in the eez of qatar ranges between 1 0 m and 3 3 m fig 10b the highest values are observed in the eastern boundary of eez this is in consistent with the distribution of shamal waves where the highest waves are found in the southern gulf fig 6c this indicates that the eastern boundary of the eez experiences higher waves due to shamal winds while the east coast of qatar experiences higher waves due to easterly winds figs 5b and 6a the annual maximum hs and tp off fuwairit are 2 3 m and 8 5 s respectively 3 5 2 seasonal mean waves in the gulf are higher during winter than summer hubert et al 1983 we found similar inferences in the seasonal mean hs in the eez of qatar fig 11 the winter mean hs is high in the northeastern offshore boundary of the eez ranging up to 0 76 m whereas the summer mean hs is high in the northern offshore boundary of the eez ranging up to 0 56 m kamranzad 2018 identified that the hs hotspots are in the central gulf during winter shamal while they move to the northwest region during summer shamal shifting of these hotspots is reflecting in the seasonal mean hs in the eez of qatar 3 5 3 monthly mean the highest monthly mean hs in the eez of qatar occurs during march up to 1 20 m followed by february up to 1 06 m and january up to 0 96 m fig 12 however this may not be consistent when compared with a long term average in the gulf where the highest monthly mean hs occurs during february kamranzad 2018 we find exceptional high easterly waves during march 2019 due to strong nashi winds which caused an increase in the mean hs compared to other months the relatively higher mean hs during march 2019 was not observed in the adjacent years 2018 and 2020 there exists a spatial variability in the higher mean hs during january march i e the highest value during january is in the northern offshore boundary while that during february and march are in the northeastern offshore boundary of the eez the spatio temporal variations in mean hs in the gulf are subject to corresponding changes in the winds especially the shamal and easterly winds prevailing during these months a long term analysis on nashi and shamal winds is required to understand their spatio temporal variabilities and the associated changes in the waves in the gulf and the eez of qatar april and june exhibit mean hs up to 0 86 m and 0 71 m respectively in the northeastern offshore boundary while july exhibits up to 0 81 m in the northern offshore of the eez in other months the mean hs within the eez is less than 0 60 m the lowest monthly mean hs is observed during october the nearshore processes are not well executed in the given results because of the relatively coarser spatial resolution of the model the wave attenuation due to coral beds seagrass meadows and mangroves should be given particular attention in the eez of qatar several other factors may also influence the nearshore wave characteristics particularly the effect of opposing winds and currents a far detailed analysis considering the above aspects is planned in our future work 4 conclusions the wave characteristics in the eez of qatar are analyzed using the measured waves off fuwairit at 7 m depth and the reanalysis waves obtained from cmems the cmems waves have been validated for the first time in the arabian gulf and the model waves reasonably reproduced the waves off fuwairit the results indicate that the easterly waves generated due to nashi winds influence the east and northeast coasts of qatar in a relatively higher potential than that during shamal events however the shamal waves show clear dominance in the northern and northeastern offshore boundaries of the eez of qatar these discrepancies are attributed to i the shamal waves have fetch limitations within the east and northeast coast of qatar while the easterly waves have sufficient fetch of the order of 350 450 km to dominate over the shamal waves and ii the northern and northeastern offshore boundaries of the eez of qatar are in the central strip of the gulf which are highly exposed to strong shamal winds with relatively longer fetch the annual mean and maximum hs off fuwairit are 0 46 m and 2 3 m respectively while those in the northern northeastern boundary of the eez are 0 7 m and 3 3 m respectively seasonally the winter exhibits higher hs than summer with a hotspot in the northeastern boundary while the hotspot during summer is in the northern boundary of the eez we find exceptional easterly waves during march 2019 contributing to the highest monthly mean hs a deviation from the long term analysis which is due to relatively stronger nashi winds over the gulf during this month although the role of major wind systems on the waves in the gulf has been examined the interaction of multi directional and multi frequency waves including those generated due to sea land breezes and associated changes in the resultant waves needs to be explored this can be done through spectral analysis however the availability of measured spectral waves is a limiting factor to carry out such analysis in this work future study is planned to unravel the spectral behaviour of the waves within the eez of qatar

20364,waves in the arabian gulf gulf are dominated by shamal winds during winter and early summer although wave characteristics in the gulf are broadly studied features associated with various wind systems are not explicitly covered especially in the exclusive economic zone eez of qatar in this study we analyzed the wave parameters measured off fuwairit north coast of qatar during 29 october 26 november 2019 to identify the features associated with different wind systems the analyses have been further extended to the gulf using the reanalysis waves obtained from the copernicus marine environment monitoring services cmems to describe the monthly seasonal and annual characteristics results indicate that nashi winds influence the east and northeast coasts of qatar with higher waves than those generated by shamal winds we find exceptional easterly nashi waves during march 2019 contributing to the highest monthly mean hs which is a deviation from the known long term wave climate of the gulf keywords waves off qatar arabian gulf nashi winds shamal winds shamal waves cmems reanalysis waves 1 introduction surface waves driven by the winds are one of the major controlling factors for the coastal dynamics for instance longshore current and sediment transport are highly influenced by nearshore wave transformation the activities such as design of coastal and offshore structures exploitation of conventional resources loading and unloading navigation and recreational activities are relied on accurate information of surface waves wave statistics derived from point measurements are generally used to describe the inherent features of waves in that region temporal and spatial analyses is usually carried out using wave model results or satellite observations though most of the studies in the indian ocean are for open ocean or coastal regions sirisha et al 2017 samiksha et al 2012 very few studies are carried out for the semi enclosed marginal seas langodan et al 2014 wave characteristics on marginal seas gained more attention in recent years particularly because of their links with dominant local regional features and global climate indices shanas et al 2017 the arabian persian gulf hereafter referred to as gulf is a semi enclosed sea connecting the arabian sea through the strait of hormuz and the sea of oman fig 1 the strait of hormuz is narrow with a minimum width of 39 km van dyke 2008 the central gulf is characterised by the exclusive economic zone eez of qatar in the south and the eez of iran in the north the eez of qatar is relatively wider off the east and north of qatar but very narrow off west of qatar north and east coasts of qatar are exposed to the complex dynamic interactions of the gulf with the arabian sea pous et al 2015 the topographic features of the gulf are complex bathymetry numerous small and big islands coral reefs seagrass meadows mangrove forests and mud sand flats khan et al 2002 the climatic features of the gulf are extreme hot summer moderate cold winter high evaporation weak precipitation shamal winds and dust storms the winds over the gulf predominantly varies between northwest nw to north n throughout the seasons while east e to southeast se winds prevail occasionally thoppil and hogan 2010 the strongest winds in the gulf are associated with shamal events notaro et al 2015 yu et al 2016 shamal events the unique weather phenomena over the arabian peninsula occur throughout the year but predominantly during winter and early summer perrone 1979 the summer shamal is caused by a steep pressure gradient formed between the northwest india low pressure and the eastern mediterranean sea high pressure while the winter shamal is associated with mid latitude disturbances moving from west to east the shamal periodicities are generally of two kinds shorter events of 24 36 h and longer events of 3 5 days based on their intensity and spatial distribution aboobacker et al 2011 the higher wind speeds during shamal events are observed in the northern and central arabian gulf liao and kaihatu 2016a the higher mean wind speed of the order of 5 9 m s during winter is observed in the central gulf whereas higher mean wind speed of the order of 4 9 m s during summer is in the northern gulf the annual mean wind speeds along the qatar coast varies between 3 0 and 5 0 m s whereas the 95thpercentile wind speed is between 8 0 and 12 0 m s patlakhas et al 2019 though winds are predominantly in the nw nnw direction sea land breezes from various directional sectors are also present when the regional wind systems weaken sandeepan et al 2018 the gulf being a semi enclosed sea waves in the gulf follows the prevailing wind patterns with relatively high impact during shamal events kamranazad 2013 the wider deflection in the orientation of the coastline adjacent to the strait of hormuz fig 1 prevents the long period swells from the arabian sea entering the gulf however interaction between young swells wind seas generated on either side of the strait of hormuz and the complex bottom topography may produce complex wave conditions near the gulf entrance the impact of such interaction may be minor as far as the wave climate of the central gulf is concerned when the sea of oman is treated as a closed boundary in the wave model the results indicate that waves coming from the sea of oman refracts and decays significantly around the strait of hormuz moeini et al 2013 therefore waves within the gulf are predominantly wind seas the mean wave periods tm are also reported to be between 1 5 and 5 0 s li et al 2020 waves in the central gulf are influenced by winds from both nw and se however dominated by nw winds vieira et al 2020 it has been identified that more energetic areas in the gulf are in the southern region off dubai where the extreme 99th percentile significant wave height hs is greater than 2 7 m and peak wave period tp is about 8 0 s during shamal dominated conditions the seasonal mean hs in the gulf is higher during winter up to 0 8 m than other seasons kamranzad 2018 the bahrain and qatar peninsulas cause sheltering effects on the predominant northwesterly waves thus significant reduction in hs occurs along the southwest and east coast of qatar vieira et al 2020 liao and kaihatu 2016a pointed out that the refraction causes 20 total energy deviation ted along the north eastern corner of qatar during winter in doha bay the waves from nw are under fetch limited conditions which result in low wave heights liao and kaihatu 2016b moreover occasionally developed easterly waves with relatively higher hs were identified along the east coast of qatar although previous studies provide a brief overview of the wave conditions in the gulf the systematic variations in wave parameters in the eez of qatar due to different wind systems are yet to be unravelled the present study aims at exploring the wave variabilities by analysing measured wave parameters off fuwairit north coast of qatar and numerical wave model results within the eez of qatar obtained from copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems fuwairit is a coastal village in qatar located in the municipality of ash shamal approximately 90 km north of doha fuwairit has a long stretch of beach with fine and white sand it is an important site for qatar s oil industry and coral reefs are not far from the measurement site it is a popular camping spot and a favourable site for kite surfers who come here on windy days fuwairit coastal area is exposed to the central gulf influenced by different wind wave and current systems and in the proximity to the dynamics of the central gulf the deployment of oceanographic equipment was carried out as a part of the ongoing physical oceanographic investigations in this region 2 data and methods waves measured off fuwairit fig 1 north coast of qatar has been anlayzed in this study the measurements have been carried out using seaguard recording current meter rcm and signature 1000 acoustic doppler current profiler adcp placed within a horizontal distance of 150 m distance between them the wave data were sampled at every 10 min interval the rcm was moored 2 m above the seabed during 29 october 26 november 2019 while the adcp was deployed in the seabed for a short period 29 october 01 november 2019 the water depth in the measurement location is 7 0 m we processed the non directional wave parameters hs and tp from the rcm while the directional wave parameters hs tp and mean wave direction mwd have been obtained from the adcp although the duration of measured data is short we find that the non directional wave parameters measured using adcp are consistent with those obtained from rcm moreover mwd obtained from the adcp has been used for the verification of wave direction obtained from reanalysis data as no other measured wave data could be obtained to incorporate in this study the accuracy of the pressure sensor in the rcm is 0 04 of the full scale output fso https www aanderaa com media pdfs seaguard rcm basic pdf the accuracies of hs and mwd in the adcp are 1 of

atmospheric land and oceanic climate variables through their reanalysis v5 era5 hersbach et al 2019 a larger quantity of past observations has been assimilated into the global estimate to ensure quality of the era5 product the spatial grid resolution of era5 winds is 30 km the era5 winds have a better accuracy compared to its predecessor era interim rivas and stoffelen 2019 the era5 winds were validated with in situ measurements in the gulf mahmoodi et al 2019 as well as along the east coast of qatar aboobacker et al 2020a we used the era5 winds in the present study to characterize the winds in the eez of qatar the cmems provides 3 hourly global analysis and forecast waves in 0 083 0 083 9 km resolution driven by the winds from the ecmwf integrated forecasting system ifs 6 hourly

ecwam ifs 38r2 computing code with dissipation terms developed by ardhuin et al 2010 where the model mean bathymetry is generated by using etopo2 national geophysical data center 2006 the wave spectrum is discretized in 24 directions and 30 frequencies starting from 0 035 hz to 0 58 hz in this study both 9 km and 22 km resolution wave model outputs during jan 2019 april 2020 have been used to characterize the waves in the eez of qatar the wave measurement location off fuwairit falls in a dry grid in 9 km resolution model while it falls in a wet grid in 22 km resolution model thus the validation of the cmems waves has been carried out using the latter however being relatively fine resolution we used the 9 km resolution outputs for a spatial analysis we find no significant difference among both the wave model results when the results are compared at an offshore location within the eez of qatar comparison is not shown it is worthy to note that the temporal and spatial resolutions of the cmems waves are adequate to describe the effects of regional wind systems on waves in the gulf however such resolutions may not capture the effects of waves generated by the local sea land breezes 3 results and discussion 3 1 wind climate in the eez of qatar the qatar peninsula and the offshore experience winds from various directions the northwesterly north northwesterly nw nnw winds are predominant along the north coast of qatar throughout the year in which the shamal winds are dominant fig 2 their relative contribution is higher during winter november april than summer may october the easterly to south southeasterly e to sse winds are more pronounced in winter which are influenced by the large scale ne monsoon winds in addition to regional winds local breezes are also found throughout the year in significant proportion sandeepan et al 2018 identified sea land breeze systems in qatar which causes diurnal variability in wind speeds especially in the onshore regions the percentage occurrence of winds off fuwairit is the highest from nnw 23 1 followed by nw 17 7 and n 7 8 while the lowest is from sw 1 7 in an annual cycle the wind speeds show high variability during winter driven by shamal and easterly winds fig 3 aboobacker et al 2020a showed that the monthly mean wind speeds along the north coast of qatar are the highest during february and the lowest during september the maximum wind speed of 16 3 m s identified in the year in consideration was associated with a strong easterly wind system occurred on 23 march 2019 this is a rare case when compared with the subsequent peaks in wind speeds which are mostly from the nw nnw directions the percentage occurrence of high winds above 10 m s is 8 6 whereas that of moderate winds between 5 and 10 m s 39 6 and low winds below 5 m s 51 8 fig 4 shows the snapshots of shamal and easterly winds in the eez of qatar during the wave measurement period here the shamal winds during the measurement period are predominantly from the nnw and of order of 8 12 m s with a decreasing intensity towards south the typical speeds of shamal winds in the gulf are generally 15 20 m s senafi and anis 2015 while a maximum speed of 22 m s were identified within the last 40 years aboobacker et al 2020b the annual occurrence of winds from the directional sector nw n is around 49 the easterly winds in the eez during the measurement period are typically of the order of 4 8 m s decreasing towards the land areas although the occurrence is relatively low less than 16 from the directional sector ene ese the easterly winds have high potential considering a longer fetch 350 450 km in the central and southern gulf and hence their impact along the east coast of qatar 3 2 observed variations in wave parameters there are typically two high wave conditions off fuwairit which are associated with i shamal winds and ii easterly winds fig 5 during the measurement period three shamal events namely shamal i 31 october 02 november shamal ii 05 07 november and shamal iii 20 21 november and two easterly wind events easterly i 10 11 november and easterly ii 16 18 november were identified the wind speeds during the pre shamal period were generally low and the directions were between e and s however during the active shamal events the hs and tp gradually increased in response to the increase in shamal wind speed in addition a gradual shift of wave direction from e to nnw nw has been noticed the maximum hs measured during shamal i shamal ii and shamal iii events are 1 23 m 1 32 m and 1 12 m respectively while the maximum tp are 6 3 s 6 7 s and 5 7 s respectively the maximum hs measured during easterly i and easterly ii events are 1 38 m and 1 68 m respectively while the maximum tp are 6 5 s and 6 9 s this indicates that the hs of easterly waves are higher than the shamal induced waves along the north coast of qatar during the measurement period this is because of the longer fetch available for the easterly waves while the fetch of shamal induced waves is very limited considering the proximity of the measurement location to the coast and geographical orientation of the coastline it is also obvious that the month november exhibits a relatively low potential shamal wind speeds compared to the peak winter shamals january march and summer shamals june 3 3 verification of cmems wave parameters wave parameters obtained from the cmems have been compared with the measurements off fuwairit fig 5b d the comparison shows that the cmems wave parameters match reasonably well with the measurements for easterly waves hs and tp are under estimated as shallow water processes are not well executed in the coarse model grid 22 km resolution which is a matter of concern for the shore normal propagating waves shamal waves are in the nnw direction which have a long fetch towards offshore until it reaches the uae coast thus in the measurement area it has a relatively lower attenuation compared to a shore normal propagating wave this resulted in a reasonably well comparison for waves in cmems model during peak shamal conditions the correlation coefficient bias root mean square error r m s e and scatter index between the measured and model hs are 0 88 0 05 m 0 17 m and 0 35 respectively the cmems tp is slightly under estimated the correlation coefficient bias r m s e and scatter index between the measured and model tp are 0 68 0 29 s 0 77 s and 0 18 respectively the mwd obtained from the cmems data matches reasonably well with that of adcp data within the limited data duration especially the directional shift associated with different wind systems has been well captured ravdas et al 2018 observed a good overall performance of cmems wave parameters in regional seas and our results are in consistent with their work thus we used this dataset to derive a qualitative description on the annual and seasonal variations of waves along the north coast of qatar 3 4 spatial patterns of shamal and easterly waves shamal waves are the strongest waves in the gulf with significant spatial variations fig 6 shows the snapshots of the shamal waves in the gulf during 01 02 march 2019 when the shamal wind prevails the height of the nw waves increases in the northern gulf while the pre existing waves ne to sw in the southern gulf retreats depending on the intensity and duration of shamal winds the shamal waves are further evolved and propagated up to the southern gulf which often cross the strait of hormuz in a previous study aboobacker et al 2011 identified the shamal winds and waves prevailing in the sea of oman and the arabian sea the north and northeast boundaries of the eez of qatar experiences higher shamal waves hs of the order of 3 4 m in this case however the highest shamal waves could be observed in the southern gulf especially off the west coast of uae with hs of the order of 3 8 m this is in consistent with the findings of vieira et al 2020 along the coast of qatar the shamal waves are typically in the nnw direction the west and southeast coasts of qatar experiences relatively lower shamal waves hs 2 0 m due to topographical features as well as fetch limitations the time series of wave parameters off fuwairit extracted from cmems for the year 2019 indicate that there are several peaks with hs higher than 1 5 m fig 7 the associated peak wave periods are between 6 0 and 8 5 s most of these peaks are from the nnw while a few are from the e the higher nnw waves are due to shamal winds while the higher e waves are due to easterly wind events the shamal induced maximum hs is 2 12 m and the corresponding tp is 7 0 s the easterly winds are either due to the ne monsoon winds or by the nashi winds villiers and heerden 2011 the nashi winds are the stronger dusty and dry northeasterly winds originating from iran during winter which enter into the gulf through the southern coast of iran near the strait of hormuz as northeasterlies these winds further flow as easterlies during their propagation in the central gulf and as southeasterlies in the northern gulf the mechanism of the formation of nashi winds in iran are similar to that of south asian subtropical low level jet identified near the iranian borders of the afghanistan and pakistan anoop et al 2019 as they are in conjunction with each other the easterly winds in the gulf are often modified by the influence of low pressure systems developed over the mediterranean and the northern arabian peninsula the highest hs 2 3 m off fuwairit occurred on 25 march 2019 was due to such easterly event during which the tp was around 8 0 8 5 s this indicates that the north coast of qatar experiences large waves from the east although their occurrences are relatively low dry and warm southeasterly winds namely kaus with moderate speeds are also observed in the gulf during winter rao et al 2001 the wave rose plot fig 8 clearly depicts the impact of these wind systems shamal nashi and kaus on wave generation in the gulf especially along the north coast of qatar the occurrence of higher waves due to these wind sources is more during winter than summer a few wave systems with lower hs are also found from various directions some of which may be attributed to sea land breezes identified within the eez of qatar sandeepan et al 2018 fig 9 shows the snapshots of the wave vectors during an easterly wind event the early generation of easterly waves is near the strait of hormuz within the limited fetch resulting in relatively small hs of the order of 1 0 1 8 m fig 9a as the fetch expands and wind intensity increases the central and northern gulf dominate with higher hs of the order of 3 3 m and 3 8 m respectively fig 9b d in comparison with shamal waves fig 6 the easterly waves have higher hs along the east coast of qatar up to 2 6 m although their relative occurrence is low the processes occurring in the nearshore regions are not only by the waves but also by the currents induced by the tide driven flows and regional scale circulations these will have significant implications in physical and biogeochemical processes along the east coast of qatar a more quantitative assessment of winds and waves using fine resolution models such as wrf and swan respectively are required to capture the local effects to a good extent and thus to enhance the understanding of biogeochemical interactions 3 5 annual seasonal and monthly distribution of hs in the eez of qatar 3 5 1 annual mean and maximum the annual mean hs in the eez of qatar is of the order of 0 2 0 7 m where the highest waves are observed in the northeast offshore boundary fig 10 a earlier studies reported that the long term highest mean hs in the gulf is along the central strip of the gulf that includes the north and northeast boundaries of the eez of qatar kamranzad 2018 mahmoodi et al 2019 the west and southeast coasts of qatar have lower hs 0 4 m due to shallow depths and shielding orography of the peninsular qatar and bahrain in the central gulf which attenuate prevent large waves entering in these regions the annual mean hs and tp off fuwairit are 0 46 m and 3 9 s respectively this indicates that northern coast of qatar experiences short period waves with moderate heights during most part of the year the annual maximum hs in the eez of qatar ranges between 1 0 m and 3 3 m fig 10b the highest values are observed in the eastern boundary of eez this is in consistent with the distribution of shamal waves where the highest waves are found in the southern gulf fig 6c this indicates that the eastern boundary of the eez experiences higher waves due to shamal winds while the east coast of qatar experiences higher waves due to easterly winds figs 5b and 6a the annual maximum hs and tp off fuwairit are 2 3 m and 8 5 s respectively 3 5 2 seasonal mean waves in the gulf are higher during winter than summer hubert et al 1983 we found similar inferences in the seasonal mean hs in the eez of qatar fig 11 the winter mean hs is high in the northeastern offshore boundary of the eez ranging up to 0 76 m whereas the summer mean hs is high in the northern offshore boundary of the eez ranging up to 0 56 m kamranzad 2018 identified that the hs hotspots are in the central gulf during winter shamal while they move to the northwest region during summer shamal shifting of these hotspots is reflecting in the seasonal mean hs in the eez of qatar 3 5 3 monthly mean the highest monthly mean hs in the eez of qatar occurs during march up to 1 20 m followed by february up to 1 06 m and january up to 0 96 m fig 12 however this may not be consistent when compared with a long term average in the gulf where the highest monthly mean hs occurs during february kamranzad 2018 we find exceptional high easterly waves during march 2019 due to strong nashi winds which caused an increase in the mean hs compared to other months the relatively higher mean hs during march 2019 was not observed in the adjacent years 2018 and 2020 there exists a spatial variability in the higher mean hs during january march i e the highest value during january is in the northern offshore boundary while that during february and march are in the northeastern offshore boundary of the eez the spatio temporal variations in mean hs in the gulf are subject to corresponding changes in the winds especially the shamal and easterly winds prevailing during these months a long term analysis on nashi and shamal winds is required to understand their spatio temporal variabilities and the associated changes in the waves in the gulf and the eez of qatar april and june exhibit mean hs up to 0 86 m and 0 71 m respectively in the northeastern offshore boundary while july exhibits up to 0 81 m in the northern offshore of the eez in other months the mean hs within the eez is less than 0 60 m the lowest monthly mean hs is observed during october the nearshore processes are not well executed in the given results because of the relatively coarser spatial resolution of the model the wave attenuation due to coral beds seagrass meadows and mangroves should be given particular attention in the eez of qatar several other factors may also influence the nearshore wave characteristics particularly the effect of opposing winds and currents a far detailed analysis considering the above aspects is planned in our future work 4 conclusions the wave characteristics in the eez of qatar are analyzed using the measured waves off fuwairit at 7 m depth and the reanalysis waves obtained from cmems the cmems waves have been validated for the first time in the arabian gulf and the model waves reasonably reproduced the waves off fuwairit the results indicate that the easterly waves generated due to nashi winds influence the east and northeast coasts of qatar in a relatively higher potential than that during shamal events however the shamal waves show clear dominance in the northern and northeastern offshore boundaries of the eez of qatar these discrepancies are attributed to i the shamal waves have fetch limitations within the east and northeast coast of qatar while the easterly waves have sufficient fetch of the order of 350 450 km to dominate over the shamal waves and ii the northern and northeastern offshore boundaries of the eez of qatar are in the central strip of the gulf which are highly exposed to strong shamal winds with relatively longer fetch the annual mean and maximum hs off fuwairit are 0 46 m and 2 3 m respectively while those in the northern northeastern boundary of the eez are 0 7 m and 3 3 m respectively seasonally the winter exhibits higher hs than summer with a hotspot in the northeastern boundary while the hotspot during summer is in the northern boundary of the eez we find exceptional easterly waves during march 2019 contributing to the highest monthly mean hs a deviation from the long term analysis which is due to relatively stronger nashi winds over the gulf during this month although the role of major wind systems on the waves in the gulf has been examined the interaction of multi directional and multi frequency waves including those generated due to sea land breezes and associated changes in the resultant waves needs to be explored this can be done through spectral analysis however the availability of measured spectral waves is a limiting factor to carry out such analysis in this work future study is planned to unravel the spectral behaviour of the waves within the eez of qatar
