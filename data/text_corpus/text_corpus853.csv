4265,bidirectional fog droplet fluxes were observed at two mountainous subtropical forests in east asia to investigate the various boundary conditions and that cause these bidirectional droplet fluxes we set up identical eddy covariance systems including a droplet spectrometer fm100 fog monitor at two study sites in the ailaoshan sw china and xitou central taiwan areas for several weeks in winter 2015 2016 and spring 2017 respectively normally fog droplets are expected to have a downward flux toward the surface for all sizes due to impaction at the vegetation s surface however we also observed temporally positive fluxes for fog droplets up to a diameter of 10 μm two different cases of bidirectional fog droplet fluxes were identified in our experiments at xitou the positive droplet number fluxes for smaller droplets occurred together with a positive sensible heat flux in combination with large critical diameters according to the köhler theory at ailaoshan similar fluxes occurred yet together with negative sensible heat fluxes in combination with small critical diameters we analyze the occurrence of these bidirectional droplet number fluxes in conjunction with the boundary layer conditions and the activation state of the droplets with diameters up to 10 μm plausible reasons for the identical flux directions at the two sites under very different microphysical fog conditions are presented keywords fog droplet fluxes east asia eddy covariance bidirectional fluxes 1 introduction in the atmosphere fog forms when the air is supersaturated with respect to water the condensation of water vapor on hygroscopic aerosol particles reduces the visibility and thus leads to the formation of fog pruppacher and klett 1996 which reduces visibility and thus leads to the formation of fog near the earth s surface it is both the number concentration of fog droplets and their size distribution that determine the amount that visibility is reduced gultepe et al 2007 fog droplets and aerosol particles greatly affect human life and nature hewson 1943 mildenberger et al 2009 for example fog plays an important role in ecosystem functioning through its participation in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles fog is a complex and dynamic phenomenon that is often neglected fog research started long ago willett 1928 petterssen 1939 hewson 1943 best 1951 and has focused on various aspects visibility liquid water content hydrological input modeling remote sensing of fog etc forests are fragile ecosystems and highly affected by climate change sperling et al 2004 zhou et al 2013 and they interact with chemical and physical processes in fog el madany et al 2016 burkard et al 2003 thalmann et al 2002 lovett 1984 eugster et al 2006 beiderwieden et al 2008 2007 simon et al 2016 gultepe and isaac 2004 our scope is to study the turbulent exchange processes of foggy air masses with the underlying forest ecosystem in order to further develop our basic understanding of these processes and their contribution to hydrological cycle instruments for fast 10 hz size resolved droplet measurements have been available for about 30 years the first studies of turbulent fog droplet fluxes were conducted around 1990 beswick et al 1991 gallagher et al 1988 and still there are only a few research groups around the world studying this topic the focus of most fog studies of turbulent fog droplet fluxes has been on water deposition due to turbulence to the ecosystem gallagher et al 1992 vong and kowalski 1995 kowalski and vong 1999 vermeulen et al 1997 thalmann et al 2002 eugster et al 2006 holwerda et al 2006 chang et al 2006 beiderwieden et al 2008 hiatt et al 2012 yamaguchi et al 2015 however studies have also found positive droplet fluxes for small droplets with diameters of up to 8 μm vong and kowalski 1995 klemm and wrzesinsky 2007 nonetheless this change of flux direction within the size domain of droplets has not been a main research focus only one study by el madany et al 2016 discussed possible causes of positive droplet fluxes this study discussed the occurrence of bidirectional fluxes in mountainous terrain but also in flat terrain positive flux have been found for droplet sizes up to 35 μm vermeulen et al 1997 degefie et al 2015a in general bidirectional fluxes do not lead to an overall positive upward flux of liquid water because the liquid water content lwc in foggy air is dominated by the large droplets which show negative downward fluxes however the common observation of positive fluxes of small droplets means that we need a better understanding of the processes that generally occur during the interaction of fog with the surface and within the fog layer as such we take a closer look at all processes occurring in different areas of the fog layer and describe their effects on the droplets of different size classes we merge different theories and observations of cloud physics and boundary layer processes to explain the origin of the positive fluxes we also consider the fact that the processes by which fog droplets form and grow depend on the dissolved ion concentrations in the droplets and on the ambient vertical humidity gradient in our study we focus on microphysical fog processes in mountainous terrain in subtropical forests which are frequently exposed to foggy conditions the goal of this study is to evaluate the processes driving bidirectional fog droplet fluxes in an environment thus our research questions are i what are sources and sinks of small droplets ii what causes bidirectional fluxes of fog droplets iii does it depend on air pollution or other boundary layer conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and study sites an eddy covariance ec system was set up at two sites in southeast asia namely the flux tower at ailaoshan national natural reserve in yunnan province china as 24 54219 n 101 02959 e 2476 m asl and the xitou flux tower in the experimental forest of national taiwan university xt 23 66460 n 120 79526 e 1150 m asl see fig 1 an identical setup full instrumentation see table 1 was used at both sites an ec system 10 hz sample frequency consisting of a droplet spectrometer fm100 and an r 50 sonic anemometer the fm100 was orientated into the main wind direction under foggy conditions to avoid particle losses as described by spiegel et al 2012 additionally a pwd 11 was used to measure the visibility whenever the visibility dropped below 1000 m 10 min mean an active fog collector modified caltech design was switched on degefie et al 2015b fog water samples were usually taken every 0 5 h to 2 h depending on the amount of water collected simon et al 2016 measurements of volume ph and conductivity were performed as soon as possible after fog water collection for detection of major ion concentrations the samples were analyzed with a ion chromatograph later on detailed methods of fog water collection for as was described by nieberding 2017 the only difference for xt is that the ion chromatographis analysis was conducted at the department of atmospheric science of the national taiwan university in addition to this short term investigation permanent ec measurements are present at both sites where instrumentation consists of an li 7500 co2 h2o infrared gas analyzer and a csat3 sonic anemometer table 1 low frequency air temperature senors are mounted at each tower at the as site the measuring period was from january 2016 through march 2016 the flux tower is located on a northwest oriented slope around 15 of a side valley in an old grown evergreen broad leaved forest see fig 2 right panel the flux system was installed at 31 6 m above ground level which is about 6 m above the canopy the main wind direction sw is caused by channeling of the valley nieberding et al 2018 the average annual temperature at the study site is 11 3 c and the annual average precipitation is 1840 mm tan et al 2011 the monsoon climate produces a wet season from may to october and a dry season from november to april schaefer et al 2009 shi and zhu 2009 during the wet season dry season the average monthly precipitation varies from 100 mm to 500 mm normally less than 50 mm song et al 2017 the driest month is march with almost no precipitation thus the measurement period was within the dry season furthermore fog events are frequent at the study site throughout the year with a peak during the wet season in summer we presume mostly orographic lifting for the occurrence of fog but there is no detailed analysis of the processes leading to foggy conditions nieberding et al 2018 at the xt site the measuring period was in march 2017 the flux tower is located in a coniferous forest dominated by cryptomeria japonica simon et al 2016 the xt tower is situated in a relatively flat area within a valley with s to n orientation slope of 15 see fig 2 left panel simon et al 2016 the occurrence of fog is strongly associated with wind directions from the north and the fog is formed orographically as a result of adiabatic cooling during uphill transport from the valley the flux system was installed at 40 m above ground level which is 10 m above canopy height the average temperature at the study site is 16 6 c and the annual average precipitation is 2635 mm simon et al 2016 there are two seasons at xt a dry season from october to april and a wet season from may to september simon et al 2016 like at as the measuring period was during the dry season march 2017 the fog frequency at xt is high with around 58 foggy days min 1 h d 1 and the fog occurs usually during daytime based on our data fog events peak during the dry season 2 2 data pre processing for this study the definition of fog as described by wmo 2006 was used in fog the horizontal visibility is reduced to below 1000 m by the presence of hydrometeors the definition was applied on the basis of 10 min averages of the pwd 11 signal at as fog occurred for a total of 386 h of fog during the measuring period which is equivalent to 34 of the total measurement period of 46 days at xt 177 h of fog were detected 25 of 29 days due to power shortages and freezing 100 h 14 of data were lost at xt we had only very few data losses less than 2 several steps of raw data pre processing needed to be performed before calculating the droplet number fluxes and the liquid water fluxes lwf in general the fm100 counts all droplets with a diameter between 2 μm and 50 μm and associates them with one of 40 channels in this range the droplet detection operates on the principle of non linear mie scattering mie 1908 in case of the fm100 at a wavelength of 680 nm however the non linearity of mie scattering causes some problems for instance a certain scattering intensity may corresponds to up to three different droplet sizes two methods are available to solve this issue a stochastic approach by spiegel et al 2012 and a field based approach by gonser et al 2011 for the present study the field based method was applied i e the 40 measuring channels were merged into 23 size classes also a smoothing filter savitzky and golay 1964 between the channels was applied to the data to reduce over or underestimation of single size classes gonser et al 2011 the fm100 raw data counts per size class were converted to number concentrations droplets per cubic meter with the optical sample area and the actual air flow the actual air flow inside the instrument was measured with a pitot tube with a relatively constant air speed of 13 02 m s 1 in cases where the pitot tube was blocked with fog water the air flow could not be calculated correctly and the value became comparably small or high such erroneous air flows with deviations of more than 1 m s 1 of the mean air speed were replaced with the mean value 13 02 m s 1 el madany et al 2016 wrzesinsky 2003 for calculating the lwc and lwf each size class was converted into a droplet diameter by using the geometric mean channel diameter with the assumption of spherical droplet shapes the size classes are not distributed equidistantly and each class covers a different size range therefore all number concentrations liquid water contents and associated fluxes were normalized by their respective class widths el madany et al 2016 this makes data more comparable to each other 2 3 flux calculation after pre processing the data we calculated the turbulent fluxes of the fm100 r3 50 system with eddyuh mammarella et al 2016 the fluxes of the permanent measurements were calculated with eddypro li cor biosciences for our short term investigation with the fm100 data we used the coordinate rotation method planar fit wilczak et al 2001 because it is suitable for instrumentation set ups on a slope with this method the coordinate system is rotated according to the mean streamlines paw et al 2000 spikes in the raw data originating from random noise in the instruments brock 1986 and from water deposition on the transducers of the sonic anemometer foken et al 2004 were removed using the method of vickers and mahrt vickers and mahrt 1997 regarding the flux calculation itself we used the approach outlined in horst 1997 for both scalar model cospectrum correction and for cospectral peak frequency vs stability parameterization the theoretical approaches by moncrieff et al 1997 and rannik and vesala 1999 were used to correct high and low frequency losses of sonic anemometer fluxes respectively time lags were determined by maximizing the covariance within a predefined lag window of 2 5 s for our data two different quality flags are available the flux stationarity test fst and the integral turbulence characteristics itc foken and wichura 1996 as our measurements were made at a slope a temporarily positive momentum flux may occur this leads to problems with interpreting the itc for the vertical wind component as the fst is not affected by the terrain we used fst flagging only we denoted all data with poor quality being flagged with values of 7 to 9 with gray pixels in the respective graphs figs 4 a b 5a b the data quality for most fog events was good only some very small fluxes had to be discarded due to bad quality 2 4 kóhler theory we used a theoretical approach to compare the ion concentrations in the droplets and their effects on droplets sizes the kóhler theory köhler 1921 seinfeld and pandis 2006 describes the equilibrium thermodynamics of droplets suspended in the gas phase with high relative humidity rh this theory describes the combination of the kelvin effect and the raoult law in general deliquesced aerosol particles exist in a stable equilibrium at sizes below their critical diameters and at an rh of below 100 up to just over 100 while their growth is accelerated once the critical diameter is exceeded in this case the aerosol particles are called activated cloud condensation nuclei ccn sometimes also called fog nuclei to calculate kóhler curves and the respective critical diameters of the fog events at our study sites we estimated the median ion concentration for single droplets first the particle mass pm of a single droplet was estimated as pm ic sum lwc median dnc median where ic g l 1 is the liquid water ionic concentration of all measured species lwc l m 3 is the liquid water content based on the data of the fog collector simon et al 2016 and dnc m 3 is the droplet number concentration measured with the fm100 the kóhler curve for each site was calculated with the particle mass pm g seinfeld and pandis 2006 an overview of all chemical components is shown in table 2 the results were inserted to the following equation according to the kóhler theory seinfeld and pandis 2006 e e 0 exp a d p b d p 3 with the terms a and b a 4 m w σ w rt ρ w b 6 n s m w π ρ w where in detail e is the actual water vapor pressure over the droplet e 0 is the water vapor pressure over a flat surface σ is the air water surface tension m w is the molecular weight of water r is the molecular gas constant t is the temperature ρ is the water density d is the droplet particle diameter and n s is the number of solute moles the critical diameter d pc can be calculated with d pc 3 b a 0 5 note that such estimates cannot be more than rough estimates because the conditions change fast between events and even temporally and spatially within single fog events 3 results 3 1 meteorology at both sites the occurrence of fog was associated with a certain wind direction sw at ailaoshan and n at xitou upslope winds cool adiabatically the relative humidity increases and orographic clouds develop which are recorded as fog at the meteorological research stations the wind speed at as was 2 m s 1 to 4 m s 1 and at xt it was up to 3 5 m s 1 the turbulence was well developed during fog events at as friction velocity u 0 3 m s 1 at xt u was between 0 07 m s 1 and 0 3 m s 1 during foggy conditions the average vertical wind speed before application of the planar fit rotation see section 2 3 at as was positive all time between 0 04 m s 1 and 0 40 m s 1 median 2 5 m s 1 at xt the pre planar fit wind speed was between 0 24 m s 1 and 0 55 m s 1 median 0 16 m s 1 negative values occurred only in the first and last hour of the fog event at both sites the latent heat flux was reduced to and subsequently fluctuated around zero w m 2 during the fog events 3 2 droplet size distribution the droplet size concentration dnc and the liquid water content lwc are shown fig 3 at as the peak of the dnc was higher but the diameters see fig 3a were smaller with virtually no droplets of diameters above 16 μm present at xt the peak of dnc is lower see fig 3a but the droplets spread over a wider size range up to 25 μm however for the lwc cum see fig 3b the picture is completely different at xt the lwc cum is more than double as the one at as this aspect is due to the cubical relation of the diameter and the volume of spherical droplets the 50 values of the lwc cum curves fig 3b are at 7 μm diameter for as and at 15 μm for xt 3 3 time series of the fog events the fog event of the 1st to 2nd march 2016 in as fig 4 began when visibility dropped below 1000 m shortly before 20 00 fig 4a from 21 00 h to 07 00 h visibility fell below 100 m with only a short break around 02 00 h in the beginning of the fog event all droplet sizes showed negative turbulent fluxes see fig 4b soon after fog formation around 19 00 h some of the smallest droplet size classes changed their flux direction into positive fluxes other sizes up to 10 μm in diameter followed around 22 00 h while the fluxes of droplets between 5 μm and 8 μm were mainly positive droplet sizes between 8 μm and 10 μm changed their flux direction several times during the event fluxes of bigger droplets 10 μm were negative at all times the orientation of size resolved liquid water fluxes see fig 4c were of course in the same direction as the respective droplet number fluxes however because of the cubic relation between the liquid water flux and the number flux the fluxes of middle sized droplets 8 μm to 15 μm dominated the lwf small droplet sizes exhibited only very low liquid water fluxes even with a large number flux because the volumes of these droplets are very small the air temperature see fig 4d dropped down from 6 c to 4 c around sunset around 19 00 h at 22 00 h the air temperature rose again up to 7 c and remained stable throughout the night in the morning with the sunrise the temperature started to rise continuously sensible heat flux see fig 4e decreased towards sunset turned negative and remained so until 5 30 h when a small positive flux occurred that increased further with the dissipation of the fog around sunrise fig 5 shows the time series of a fog event at xt during the daytime of 9th march 2017 for the first time the visibility dropped below 1000 m around 09 00 h see fig 5a from 11 30 h on the visibility was extremely reduced most of the time the visibility was 50 m for several hours until 20 00 h this fog event see fig 5b had similar droplet number fluxes as the one at as see fig 4c around noon fog occurred and the droplet number fluxes of all droplet sizes were negative thus moving toward the surface at 11 00 h small droplets 3 μm changed their flux direction to positive fluxes size classes up to a diameter of 10 μm followed at 12 00 h the fluxes of small droplets continued to be positive until the end of the fog event at 20 00 h around 16 00 h the fog was less dense and the droplet fluxes were small as described for as the liquid water fluxes were in the same direction as the droplet number fluxes see fig 5b c the air temperature see fig 5d was much higher compared to as see fig 4d the temperature did rise in the morning from 13 c to 15 c and was somewhat reduced to 13 c with the onset of fog at 11 30 h the sensible heat flux see fig 5e rose with the sunrise at 8 00 h the flux peaked at around 11 00 h and dropped with the formation of fog the sensible heat flux stayed positive 3 4 critical diameters the available aerosols grow due to heterogeneous nucleation they are called cnn aerosols can only act as cnn if they are water soluble stull 2017 therefore the chemical composition of the aerosol particles is important we estimated the critical diameters of the fog droplets for our two sites as and xt as described in section 2 4 above the kóhler curves for the fog events on the 1st 2nd march 2016 at as and on the 9th march 2017 at xt are shown in fig 6 it is apparent that the critical diameters at the two sites are very different from each other the lower ic at as as compared to xt led to a generally lower critical diameter the median droplet size diameter is similar at both sites at around 7 μm we conclude from this analysis of the critical diameters that at as most of the droplets were activated but at xt most of the droplets were non activated note that the xt site is exposed to much higher levels of air pollution than the as site simon et al 2016 nieberding et al 2018 this leads to larger ccn larger fog droplets and to larger critical diameters at the xt site 4 discussion the analysis of fog droplet fluxes at the two subtropical forested mountainous sites revealed remarkable similarities there was a net deposition flux of liquid water throughout the events which is expected as a result of impaction of fog water droplets to the trees when transported to the respective surfaces through turbulence el madany et al 2016 vermeulen et al 1997 holwerda et al 2006 the size resolved droplet number fluxes however showed positive fluxes for small droplets 10 μm diameters throughout rather long time periods of the events several hours similar observations were made by el madany et al 2016 at a different forest site chilan in ne taiwan they argued that the respective droplets encounter warmer ambient air when moving downward evaporate partially and thus decrease in size and eventually are transported back upward again as smaller droplets through turbulent mixing this process was associated with an positive sensible heat flux the situation observed in the current study at xt is similar to that described by el madany et al 2016 as the sensible heat fluxes during the occurrence of bidirectional fog droplet fluxes were positive note that the conditions at as were different regarding one important aspect the sensible heat fluxes during the time period of bidirectional fog droplet fluxes were negative therefore the explanation offered by el madany et al 2016 which also holds for xt cannot explain the observed bidirectional fluxes at as 4 1 sinks and sources of droplets in the following we disentangle the involved processes step by step in order to develop a general understanding of the conditions leading to the observed bidirectional fog droplet fluxes first we look at the processes at the canopy the foggy air mass flows around leaves twigs and branches and the fog droplets follow the movement of the air if the fog droplets cannot follow the streamlines of the turbulence elements they impact at the canopy in general the canopy acts as a sink of all droplet sizes due to impaction however according to the stokes law smaller droplets can follow the streamlines better than bigger ones while bigger droplets have a higher likelihood to impact seinfeld and pandis 2006 the stokes law generally describes the dependence of the frictional force of spherical bodies in a viscous fluid seinfeld and pandis 2006 other potential sinks and sources of droplets of given sizes are the growing and shrinking of droplets above the canopy yet inside the fog layer no fog can be assumed to be a homogeneous isotherm or a perfectly adiabatically layered air mass instead foggy layers contain air masses with higher rh and other air masses with lower rh pruppacher and klett 1996 depending on the meteorological conditions that may have led to the formation of a specific fog the vertical temperature gradient may be either positive or negative bruijnzeel et al 2005 therefore individual fog droplets being transported upward or downward through turbulent motion may experience a transition from slightly lower rh to slightly higher rh or vice versa this slight difference in rh around saturation or supersaturation will generally speaking lead to evaporation and condensation processes and thus to shrinking and growth of droplets during their vertical transport gerber 1991 gerber 1980 fritz et al 2021 li et al 2019 4 2 heat fluxes we do not have height resolved temperature and relative humidity measurements at either site however the sensible heat flux clearly suggests the presence of a temperature difference with height and this temperature gradient also affects the relative humidity the flux direction of the sensible heat flux at as is negative while it is positive at xt see figs 4e and 5e therefore it is safe to state that the temperature at as is cooler close to the surface than above at xt we assume a higher temperature closer to the canopy than higher above 4 3 droplet activation and heat fluxes merging our knowledge about the droplet activation and the sensible heat flux we propose mechanisms of droplet dynamics at xt and as respectively as sketched in fig 7 the thermal layering of the fog layer at xt is opposite to what one would expect for radiation fog but identical to that reported by el madany et al 2016 for a similar mountain fog site in ne taiwan the upper air above the instruments is cooler than the lower air see section 4 2 the fog droplets consist mainly of non activated droplets such droplets evaporate partially during their turbulent transport downward when moving upward the droplets get into cooler air with higher rh and thus grow through condensation the evaporation and condensation processes are faster than the transport of individual droplets so smaller droplets diameters 10 μm move upward and larger droplets 10 μm move downward other experiments show an exchange time due to turbulence of around 90 s and a roughly estimated time for droplet growth from 0 25 μm to 17 33 μm unpublished baumberger et al 2021 this pattern explains the bidirectional flux pattern at xt fig 5b c the lower part of the fog layer is considered a relative source of small droplets whereas within the fog layer above the instruments the droplets grow therefore the upper air is a sink for small droplets the situation at as is different in two ways first the thermal layering of foggy air is the opposite in that cooler air with higher rh is below the instruments and warmer air is above second the critical diameters of fog droplets are much smaller fig 7 left panels through the combination of these conditions the bidirectional flux pattern at as is similar to that at xt large droplets are transported from above the instruments downward and reach more humid conditions note that the size ranges of droplets being transported upward was generally similar at as and xt due the specific shape of the kóhler curve at diameters larger than the critical diameters of the droplets these droplets evaporate somewhat on their way down analogously smaller droplets moving upward reach less humid air yet still above 100 rh but still grow in size fig 7 left panels in total the number of small droplets transported upward was higher than the number of droplets transported downward the fog layer above the instruments is a sink for small droplets and a source for big droplets due to condensation growth of the smaller droplets and reaching larger diameters 5 conclusion bidirectional droplet number fluxes were observed at two study sites and periods in mainland china from january to march 2016 as ailaoshan national natural reserve in yunnan province 24 54219 n 101 02959 e 2476 m asl and in taiwan in march 2017 xt xitou experimental forest of national taiwan university in nantou country 23 66460 n 120 79526 e 1150 m asl an approved setup of a eddy covariance system including a droplet spectrometer fm100 fog monitor was used at both sites similar to el madany et al 2016 the normally expected flux direction for all droplet size classes is negative toward the surface however we identified as other studies have before positive fluxes upward into the atmosphere for specific size classes at both sites droplets with sizes up to a 10 μm diameter showed positive fluxes at least temporarily during individual fog events to understand the processes inside the fog layer leading to these bidirectional fluxes we merged our knowledge of droplet activation according to the kóhler theory köhler 1921 and the measured sensible heat fluxes we verified two different cases of bidirectional droplet fluxes at xt the positive droplet number fluxes for smaller droplets diameter up to 10 μm occurred together with a positive sensible heat flux in combination with large critical diameters while at as the same fluxes occurred with negative sensible heat fluxes in combination with small critical diameters in the end bidirectional droplet number fluxes are caused by the i boundary layer conditions particularly regarding the sensible heat flux from which we conclude a temperature and humidity gradient with height and ii the size and chemical composition of available ccn for the droplets to form via condensation our study supports the general understanding that liquid water is deposited to ecosystems surfaces and thus impacts their hydrological budgets the involved process are however much more complex the interaction between energy fluxes and microphysics of droplets under various boundary conditions suggests a far more complex picture in which droplets of various sizes exhibit varying flux directions as such the involved processes should be studied in more detail further investigations are needed to understand all processes inside of the fog layer we suggest that further studies measure temperature and humidity precisely in a height profile measure droplet sizes over a wider size range and measure both dry and wet particles size and chemical composition before the onset of fog events as well as during long term investigations such studies should also include turbulent fluxes and the chemical compositions of non activated droplets with sizes under 2 μm in diameter 6 authors contributions bettina breuer methodology software validation formal analysis investigation data curation

4265,bidirectional fog droplet fluxes were observed at two mountainous subtropical forests in east asia to investigate the various boundary conditions and that cause these bidirectional droplet fluxes we set up identical eddy covariance systems including a droplet spectrometer fm100 fog monitor at two study sites in the ailaoshan sw china and xitou central taiwan areas for several weeks in winter 2015 2016 and spring 2017 respectively normally fog droplets are expected to have a downward flux toward the surface for all sizes due to impaction at the vegetation s surface however we also observed temporally positive fluxes for fog droplets up to a diameter of 10 μm two different cases of bidirectional fog droplet fluxes were identified in our experiments at xitou the positive droplet number fluxes for smaller droplets occurred together with a positive sensible heat flux in combination with large critical diameters according to the köhler theory at ailaoshan similar fluxes occurred yet together with negative sensible heat fluxes in combination with small critical diameters we analyze the occurrence of these bidirectional droplet number fluxes in conjunction with the boundary layer conditions and the activation state of the droplets with diameters up to 10 μm plausible reasons for the identical flux directions at the two sites under very different microphysical fog conditions are presented keywords fog droplet fluxes east asia eddy covariance bidirectional fluxes 1 introduction in the atmosphere fog forms when the air is supersaturated with respect to water the condensation of water vapor on hygroscopic aerosol particles reduces the visibility and thus leads to the formation of fog pruppacher and klett 1996 which reduces visibility and thus leads to the formation of fog near the earth s surface it is both the number concentration of fog droplets and their size distribution that determine the amount that visibility is reduced gultepe et al 2007 fog droplets and aerosol particles greatly affect human life and nature hewson 1943 mildenberger et al 2009 for example fog plays an important role in ecosystem functioning through its participation in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles fog is a complex and dynamic phenomenon that is often neglected fog research started long ago willett 1928 petterssen 1939 hewson 1943 best 1951 and has focused on various aspects visibility liquid water content hydrological input modeling remote sensing of fog etc forests are fragile ecosystems and highly affected by climate change sperling et al 2004 zhou et al 2013 and they interact with chemical and physical processes in fog el madany et al 2016 burkard et al 2003 thalmann et al 2002 lovett 1984 eugster et al 2006 beiderwieden et al 2008 2007 simon et al 2016 gultepe and isaac 2004 our scope is to study the turbulent exchange processes of foggy air masses with the underlying forest ecosystem in order to further develop our basic understanding of these processes and their contribution to hydrological cycle instruments for fast 10 hz size resolved droplet measurements have been available for about 30 years the first studies of turbulent fog droplet fluxes were conducted around 1990 beswick et al 1991 gallagher et al 1988 and still there are only a few research groups around the world studying this topic the focus of most fog studies of turbulent fog droplet fluxes has been on water deposition due to turbulence to the ecosystem gallagher et al 1992 vong and kowalski 1995 kowalski and vong 1999 vermeulen et al 1997 thalmann et al 2002 eugster et al 2006 holwerda et al 2006 chang et al 2006 beiderwieden et al 2008 hiatt et al 2012 yamaguchi et al 2015 however studies have also found positive droplet fluxes for small droplets with diameters of up to 8 μm vong and kowalski 1995 klemm and wrzesinsky 2007 nonetheless this change of flux direction within the size domain of droplets has not been a main research focus only one study by el madany et al 2016 discussed possible causes of positive droplet fluxes this study discussed the occurrence of bidirectional fluxes in mountainous terrain but also in flat terrain positive flux have been found for droplet sizes up to 35 μm vermeulen et al 1997 degefie et al 2015a in general bidirectional fluxes do not lead to an overall positive upward flux of liquid water because the liquid water content lwc in foggy air is dominated by the large droplets which show negative downward fluxes however the common observation of positive fluxes of small droplets means that we need a better understanding of the processes that generally occur during the interaction of fog with the surface and within the fog layer as such we take a closer look at all processes occurring in different areas of the fog layer and describe their effects on the droplets of different size classes we merge different theories and observations of cloud physics and boundary layer processes to explain the origin of the positive fluxes we also consider the fact that the processes by which fog droplets form and grow depend on the dissolved ion concentrations in the droplets and on the ambient vertical humidity gradient in our study we focus on microphysical fog processes in mountainous terrain in subtropical forests which are frequently exposed to foggy conditions the goal of this study is to evaluate the processes driving bidirectional fog droplet fluxes in an environment thus our research questions are i what are sources and sinks of small droplets ii what causes bidirectional fluxes of fog droplets iii does it depend on air pollution or other boundary layer conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and study sites an eddy covariance ec system was set up at two sites in southeast asia namely the flux tower at ailaoshan national natural reserve in yunnan province china as 24 54219 n 101 02959 e 2476 m asl and the xitou flux tower in the experimental forest of national taiwan university xt 23 66460 n 120 79526 e 1150 m asl see fig 1 an identical setup full instrumentation see table 1 was used at both sites an ec system 10 hz sample frequency consisting of a droplet spectrometer fm100 and an r 50 sonic anemometer the fm100 was orientated into the main wind direction under foggy conditions to avoid particle losses as described by spiegel et al 2012 additionally a pwd 11 was used to measure the visibility whenever the visibility dropped below 1000 m 10 min mean an active fog collector modified caltech design was switched on degefie et al 2015b fog water samples were usually taken every 0 5 h to 2 h depending on the amount of water collected simon et al 2016 measurements of volume ph and conductivity were performed as soon as possible after fog water collection for detection of major ion concentrations the samples were analyzed with a ion chromatograph later on detailed methods of fog water collection for as was described by nieberding 2017 the only difference for xt is that the ion chromatographis analysis was conducted at the department of atmospheric science of the national taiwan university in addition to this short term investigation permanent ec measurements are present at both sites where instrumentation consists of an li 7500 co2 h2o infrared gas analyzer and a csat3 sonic anemometer table 1 low frequency air temperature senors are mounted at each tower at the as site the measuring period was from january 2016 through march 2016 the flux tower is located on a northwest oriented slope around 15 of a side valley in an old grown evergreen broad leaved forest see fig 2 right panel the flux system was installed at 31 6 m above ground level which is about 6 m above the canopy the main wind direction sw is caused by channeling of the valley nieberding et al 2018 the average annual temperature at the study site is 11 3 c and the annual average precipitation is 1840 mm tan et al 2011 the monsoon climate produces a wet season from may to october and a dry season from november to april schaefer et al 2009 shi and zhu 2009 during the wet season dry season the average monthly precipitation varies from 100 mm to 500 mm normally less than 50 mm song et al 2017 the driest month is march with almost no precipitation thus the measurement period was within the dry season furthermore fog events are frequent at the study site throughout the year with a peak during the wet season in summer we presume mostly orographic lifting for the occurrence of fog but there is no detailed analysis of the processes leading to foggy conditions nieberding et al 2018 at the xt site the measuring period was in march 2017 the flux tower is located in a coniferous forest dominated by cryptomeria japonica simon et al 2016 the xt tower is situated in a relatively flat area within a valley with s to n orientation slope of 15 see fig 2 left panel simon et al 2016 the occurrence of fog is strongly associated with wind directions from the north and the fog is formed orographically as a result of adiabatic cooling during uphill transport from the valley the flux system was installed at 40 m above ground level which is 10 m above canopy height the average temperature at the study site is 16 6 c and the annual average precipitation is 2635 mm simon et al 2016 there are two seasons at xt a dry season from october to april and a wet season from may to september simon et al 2016 like at as the measuring period was during the dry season march 2017 the fog frequency at xt is high with around 58 foggy days min 1 h d 1 and the fog occurs usually during daytime based on our data fog events peak during the dry season 2 2 data pre processing for this study the definition of fog as described by wmo 2006 was used in fog the horizontal visibility is reduced to below 1000 m by the presence of hydrometeors the definition was applied on the basis of 10 min averages of the pwd 11 signal at as fog occurred for a total of 386 h of fog during the measuring period which is equivalent to 34 of the total measurement period of 46 days at xt 177 h of fog were detected 25 of 29 days due to power shortages and freezing 100 h 14 of data were lost at xt we had only very few data losses less than 2 several steps of raw data pre processing needed to be performed before calculating the droplet number fluxes and the liquid water fluxes lwf in general the fm100 counts all droplets with a diameter between 2 μm and 50 μm and associates them with one of 40 channels in this range the droplet detection operates on the principle of non linear mie scattering mie 1908 in case of the fm100 at a wavelength of 680 nm however the non linearity of mie scattering causes some problems for instance a certain scattering intensity may corresponds to up to three different droplet sizes two methods are available to solve this issue a stochastic approach by spiegel et al 2012 and a field based approach by gonser et al 2011 for the present study the field based method was applied i e the 40 measuring channels were merged into 23 size classes also a smoothing filter savitzky and golay 1964 between the channels was applied to the data to reduce over or underestimation of single size classes gonser et al 2011 the fm100 raw data counts per size class were converted to number concentrations droplets per cubic meter with the optical sample area and the actual air flow the actual air flow inside the instrument was measured with a pitot tube with a relatively constant air speed of 13 02 m s 1 in cases where the pitot tube was blocked with fog water the air flow could not be calculated correctly and the value became comparably small or high such erroneous air flows with deviations of more than 1 m s 1 of the mean air speed were replaced with the mean value 13 02 m s 1 el madany et al 2016 wrzesinsky 2003 for calculating the lwc and lwf each size class was converted into a droplet diameter by using the geometric mean channel diameter with the assumption of spherical droplet shapes the size classes are not distributed equidistantly and each class covers a different size range therefore all number concentrations liquid water contents and associated fluxes were normalized by their respective class widths el madany et al 2016 this makes data more comparable to each other 2 3 flux calculation after pre processing the data we calculated the turbulent fluxes of the fm100 r3 50 system with eddyuh mammarella et al 2016 the fluxes of the permanent measurements were calculated with eddypro li cor biosciences for our short term investigation with the fm100 data we used the coordinate rotation method planar fit wilczak et al 2001 because it is suitable for instrumentation set ups on a slope with this method the coordinate system is rotated according to the mean streamlines paw et al 2000 spikes in the raw data originating from random noise in the instruments brock 1986 and from water deposition on the transducers of the sonic anemometer foken et al 2004 were removed using the method of vickers and mahrt vickers and mahrt 1997 regarding the flux calculation itself we used the approach outlined in horst 1997 for both scalar model cospectrum correction and for cospectral peak frequency vs stability parameterization the theoretical approaches by moncrieff et al 1997 and rannik and vesala 1999 were used to correct high and low frequency losses of sonic anemometer fluxes respectively time lags were determined by maximizing the covariance within a predefined lag window of 2 5 s for our data two different quality flags are available the flux stationarity test fst and the integral turbulence characteristics itc foken and wichura 1996 as our measurements were made at a slope a temporarily positive momentum flux may occur this leads to problems with interpreting the itc for the vertical wind component as the fst is not affected by the terrain we used fst flagging only we denoted all data with poor quality being flagged with values of 7 to 9 with gray pixels in the respective graphs figs 4 a b 5a b the data quality for most fog events was good only some very small fluxes had to be discarded due to bad quality 2 4 kóhler theory we used a theoretical approach to compare the ion concentrations in the droplets and their effects on droplets sizes the kóhler theory köhler 1921 seinfeld and pandis 2006 describes the equilibrium thermodynamics of droplets suspended in the gas phase with high relative humidity rh this theory describes the combination of the kelvin effect and the raoult law in general deliquesced aerosol particles exist in a stable equilibrium at sizes below their critical diameters and at an rh of below 100 up to just over 100 while their growth is accelerated once the critical diameter is exceeded in this case the aerosol particles are called activated cloud condensation nuclei ccn sometimes also called fog nuclei to calculate kóhler curves and the respective critical diameters of the fog events at our study sites we estimated the median ion concentration for single droplets first the particle mass pm of a single droplet was estimated as pm ic sum lwc median dnc median where ic g l 1 is the liquid water ionic concentration of all measured species lwc l m 3 is the liquid water content based on the data of the fog collector simon et al 2016 and dnc m 3 is the droplet number concentration measured with the fm100 the kóhler curve for each site was calculated with the particle mass pm g seinfeld and pandis 2006 an overview of all chemical components is shown in table 2 the results were inserted to the following equation according to the kóhler theory seinfeld and pandis 2006 e e 0 exp a d p b d p 3 with the terms a and b a 4 m w σ w rt ρ w b 6 n s m w π ρ w where in detail e is the actual water vapor pressure over the droplet e 0 is the water vapor pressure over a flat surface σ is the air water surface tension m w is the molecular weight of water r is the molecular gas constant t is the temperature ρ is the water density d is the droplet particle diameter and n s is the number of solute moles the critical diameter d pc can be calculated with d pc 3 b a 0 5 note that such estimates cannot be more than rough estimates because the conditions change fast between events and even temporally and spatially within single fog events 3 results 3 1 meteorology at both sites the occurrence of fog was associated with a certain wind direction sw at ailaoshan and n at xitou upslope winds cool adiabatically the relative humidity increases and orographic clouds develop which are recorded as fog at the meteorological research stations the wind speed at as was 2 m s 1 to 4 m s 1 and at xt it was up to 3 5 m s 1 the turbulence was well developed during fog events at as friction velocity u 0 3 m s 1 at xt u was between 0 07 m s 1 and 0 3 m s 1 during foggy conditions the average vertical wind speed before application of the planar fit rotation see section 2 3 at as was positive all time between 0 04 m s 1 and 0 40 m s 1 median 2 5 m s 1 at xt the pre planar fit wind speed was between 0 24 m s 1 and 0 55 m s 1 median 0 16 m s 1 negative values occurred only in the first and last hour of the fog event at both sites the latent heat flux was reduced to and subsequently fluctuated around zero w m 2 during the fog events 3 2 droplet size distribution the droplet size concentration dnc and the liquid water content lwc are shown fig 3 at as the peak of the dnc was higher but the diameters see fig 3a were smaller with virtually no droplets of diameters above 16 μm present at xt the peak of dnc is lower see fig 3a but the droplets spread over a wider size range up to 25 μm however for the lwc cum see fig 3b the picture is completely different at xt the lwc cum is more than double as the one at as this aspect is due to the cubical relation of the diameter and the volume of spherical droplets the 50 values of the lwc cum curves fig 3b are at 7 μm diameter for as and at 15 μm for xt 3 3 time series of the fog events the fog event of the 1st to 2nd march 2016 in as fig 4 began when visibility dropped below 1000 m shortly before 20 00 fig 4a from 21 00 h to 07 00 h visibility fell below 100 m with only a short break around 02 00 h in the beginning of the fog event all droplet sizes showed negative turbulent fluxes see fig 4b soon after fog formation around 19 00 h some of the smallest droplet size classes changed their flux direction into positive fluxes other sizes up to 10 μm in diameter followed around 22 00 h while the fluxes of droplets between 5 μm and 8 μm were mainly positive droplet sizes between 8 μm and 10 μm changed their flux direction several times during the event fluxes of bigger droplets 10 μm were negative at all times the orientation of size resolved liquid water fluxes see fig 4c were of course in the same direction as the respective droplet number fluxes however because of the cubic relation between the liquid water flux and the number flux the fluxes of middle sized droplets 8 μm to 15 μm dominated the lwf small droplet sizes exhibited only very low liquid water fluxes even with a large number flux because the volumes of these droplets are very small the air temperature see fig 4d dropped down from 6 c to 4 c around sunset around 19 00 h at 22 00 h the air temperature rose again up to 7 c and remained stable throughout the night in the morning with the sunrise the temperature started to rise continuously sensible heat flux see fig 4e decreased towards sunset turned negative and remained so until 5 30 h when a small positive flux occurred that increased further with the dissipation of the fog around sunrise fig 5 shows the time series of a fog event at xt during the daytime of 9th march 2017 for the first time the visibility dropped below 1000 m around 09 00 h see fig 5a from 11 30 h on the visibility was extremely reduced most of the time the visibility was 50 m for several hours until 20 00 h this fog event see fig 5b had similar droplet number fluxes as the one at as see fig 4c around noon fog occurred and the droplet number fluxes of all droplet sizes were negative thus moving toward the surface at 11 00 h small droplets 3 μm changed their flux direction to positive fluxes size classes up to a diameter of 10 μm followed at 12 00 h the fluxes of small droplets continued to be positive until the end of the fog event at 20 00 h around 16 00 h the fog was less dense and the droplet fluxes were small as described for as the liquid water fluxes were in the same direction as the droplet number fluxes see fig 5b c the air temperature see fig 5d was much higher compared to as see fig 4d the temperature did rise in the morning from 13 c to 15 c and was somewhat reduced to 13 c with the onset of fog at 11 30 h the sensible heat flux see fig 5e rose with the sunrise at 8 00 h the flux peaked at around 11 00 h and dropped with the formation of fog the sensible heat flux stayed positive 3 4 critical diameters the available aerosols grow due to heterogeneous nucleation they are called cnn aerosols can only act as cnn if they are water soluble stull 2017 therefore the chemical composition of the aerosol particles is important we estimated the critical diameters of the fog droplets for our two sites as and xt as described in section 2 4 above the kóhler curves for the fog events on the 1st 2nd march 2016 at as and on the 9th march 2017 at xt are shown in fig 6 it is apparent that the critical diameters at the two sites are very different from each other the lower ic at as as compared to xt led to a generally lower critical diameter the median droplet size diameter is similar at both sites at around 7 μm we conclude from this analysis of the critical diameters that at as most of the droplets were activated but at xt most of the droplets were non activated note that the xt site is exposed to much higher levels of air pollution than the as site simon et al 2016 nieberding et al 2018 this leads to larger ccn larger fog droplets and to larger critical diameters at the xt site 4 discussion the analysis of fog droplet fluxes at the two subtropical forested mountainous sites revealed remarkable similarities there was a net deposition flux of liquid water throughout the events which is expected as a result of impaction of fog water droplets to the trees when transported to the respective surfaces through turbulence el madany et al 2016 vermeulen et al 1997 holwerda et al 2006 the size resolved droplet number fluxes however showed positive fluxes for small droplets 10 μm diameters throughout rather long time periods of the events several hours similar observations were made by el madany et al 2016 at a different forest site chilan in ne taiwan they argued that the respective droplets encounter warmer ambient air when moving downward evaporate partially and thus decrease in size and eventually are transported back upward again as smaller droplets through turbulent mixing this process was associated with an positive sensible heat flux the situation observed in the current study at xt is similar to that described by el madany et al 2016 as the sensible heat fluxes during the occurrence of bidirectional fog droplet fluxes were positive note that the conditions at as were different regarding one important aspect the sensible heat fluxes during the time period of bidirectional fog droplet fluxes were negative therefore the explanation offered by el madany et al 2016 which also holds for xt cannot explain the observed bidirectional fluxes at as 4 1 sinks and sources of droplets in the following we disentangle the involved processes step by step in order to develop a general understanding of the conditions leading to the observed bidirectional fog droplet fluxes first we look at the processes at the canopy the foggy air mass flows around leaves twigs and branches and the fog droplets follow the movement of the air if the fog droplets cannot follow the streamlines of the turbulence elements they impact at the canopy in general the canopy acts as a sink of all droplet sizes due to impaction however according to the stokes law smaller droplets can follow the streamlines better than bigger ones while bigger droplets have a higher likelihood to impact seinfeld and pandis 2006 the stokes law generally describes the dependence of the frictional force of spherical bodies in a viscous fluid seinfeld and pandis 2006 other potential sinks and sources of droplets of given sizes are the growing and shrinking of droplets above the canopy yet inside the fog layer no fog can be assumed to be a homogeneous isotherm or a perfectly adiabatically layered air mass instead foggy layers contain air masses with higher rh and other air masses with lower rh pruppacher and klett 1996 depending on the meteorological conditions that may have led to the formation of a specific fog the vertical temperature gradient may be either positive or negative bruijnzeel et al 2005 therefore individual fog droplets being transported upward or downward through turbulent motion may experience a transition from slightly lower rh to slightly higher rh or vice versa this slight difference in rh around saturation or supersaturation will generally speaking lead to evaporation and condensation processes and thus to shrinking and growth of droplets during their vertical transport gerber 1991 gerber 1980 fritz et al 2021 li et al 2019 4 2 heat fluxes we do not have height resolved temperature and relative humidity measurements at either site however the sensible heat flux clearly suggests the presence of a temperature difference with height and this temperature gradient also affects the relative humidity the flux direction of the sensible heat flux at as is negative while it is positive at xt see figs 4e and 5e therefore it is safe to state that the temperature at as is cooler close to the surface than above at xt we assume a higher temperature closer to the canopy than higher above 4 3 droplet activation and heat fluxes merging our knowledge about the droplet activation and the sensible heat flux we propose mechanisms of droplet dynamics at xt and as respectively as sketched in fig 7 the thermal layering of the fog layer at xt is opposite to what one would expect for radiation fog but identical to that reported by el madany et al 2016 for a similar mountain fog site in ne taiwan the upper air above the instruments is cooler than the lower air see section 4 2 the fog droplets consist mainly of non activated droplets such droplets evaporate partially during their turbulent transport downward when moving upward the droplets get into cooler air with higher rh and thus grow through condensation the evaporation and condensation processes are faster than the transport of individual droplets so smaller droplets diameters 10 μm move upward and larger droplets 10 μm move downward other experiments show an exchange time due to turbulence of around 90 s and a roughly estimated time for droplet growth from 0 25 μm to 17 33 μm unpublished baumberger et al 2021 this pattern explains the bidirectional flux pattern at xt fig 5b c the lower part of the fog layer is considered a relative source of small droplets whereas within the fog layer above the instruments the droplets grow therefore the upper air is a sink for small droplets the situation at as is different in two ways first the thermal layering of foggy air is the opposite in that cooler air with higher rh is below the instruments and warmer air is above second the critical diameters of fog droplets are much smaller fig 7 left panels through the combination of these conditions the bidirectional flux pattern at as is similar to that at xt large droplets are transported from above the instruments downward and reach more humid conditions note that the size ranges of droplets being transported upward was generally similar at as and xt due the specific shape of the kóhler curve at diameters larger than the critical diameters of the droplets these droplets evaporate somewhat on their way down analogously smaller droplets moving upward reach less humid air yet still above 100 rh but still grow in size fig 7 left panels in total the number of small droplets transported upward was higher than the number of droplets transported downward the fog layer above the instruments is a sink for small droplets and a source for big droplets due to condensation growth of the smaller droplets and reaching larger diameters 5 conclusion bidirectional droplet number fluxes were observed at two study sites and periods in mainland china from january to march 2016 as ailaoshan national natural reserve in yunnan province 24 54219 n 101 02959 e 2476 m asl and in taiwan in march 2017 xt xitou experimental forest of national taiwan university in nantou country 23 66460 n 120 79526 e 1150 m asl an approved setup of a eddy covariance system including a droplet spectrometer fm100 fog monitor was used at both sites similar to el madany et al 2016 the normally expected flux direction for all droplet size classes is negative toward the surface however we identified as other studies have before positive fluxes upward into the atmosphere for specific size classes at both sites droplets with sizes up to a 10 μm diameter showed positive fluxes at least temporarily during individual fog events to understand the processes inside the fog layer leading to these bidirectional fluxes we merged our knowledge of droplet activation according to the kóhler theory köhler 1921 and the measured sensible heat fluxes we verified two different cases of bidirectional droplet fluxes at xt the positive droplet number fluxes for smaller droplets diameter up to 10 μm occurred together with a positive sensible heat flux in combination with large critical diameters while at as the same fluxes occurred with negative sensible heat fluxes in combination with small critical diameters in the end bidirectional droplet number fluxes are caused by the i boundary layer conditions particularly regarding the sensible heat flux from which we conclude a temperature and humidity gradient with height and ii the size and chemical composition of available ccn for the droplets to form via condensation our study supports the general understanding that liquid water is deposited to ecosystems surfaces and thus impacts their hydrological budgets the involved process are however much more complex the interaction between energy fluxes and microphysics of droplets under various boundary conditions suggests a far more complex picture in which droplets of various sizes exhibit varying flux directions as such the involved processes should be studied in more detail further investigations are needed to understand all processes inside of the fog layer we suggest that further studies measure temperature and humidity precisely in a height profile measure droplet sizes over a wider size range and measure both dry and wet particles size and chemical composition before the onset of fog events as well as during long term investigations such studies should also include turbulent fluxes and the chemical compositions of non activated droplets with sizes under 2 μm in diameter 6 authors contributions bettina breuer methodology software validation formal analysis investigation data curation

4266,stochastic modeling of precipitation for estimation of hydrological extremes is an important element of flood risk assessment and management the spatially consistent estimation of rainfall fields and their temporal variability remains challenging and is addressed by various stochastic weather generators in this study two types of weather generators are evaluated against observed data and benchmarked regarding their ability to simulate spatio temporal precipitation fields in the rhine catchment a multi site station based weather generator uses an auto regressive model and estimates the spatial correlation structure between stations another weather generator is raster based and uses the nearest neighbor resampling technique for reshuffling daily patterns while preserving the correlation structure between the observations both weather generators perform well and are comparable at the point station scale with regards to daily mean and 99 9th percentile precipitation as well as concerning wet dry frequencies and transition probabilities the areal extreme precipitation at the sub basin scale is however overestimated in the station based weather generator due to an overestimation of the correlation structure between individual stations the auto regressive model tends to generate larger rainfall fields in space for extreme precipitation than observed particularly in summer the weather generator based on nearest neighbor resampling reproduces the observed daily and multi day 5 10 and 20 extreme events in a similar magnitude improvements in performance regarding wet frequencies and transition probabilities are recommended for both models keywords rainfall generation rainfall occurrence multi site stochastic weather generator resampling weather generator time series analysis 1 introduction floods affect more people than any other natural hazard and the annual average loss has been estimated to be around us 100 billion un 2015 to develop ffective risk management strategies flood magnitudes associated losses and probabilities have to be quantified it is particularly important to include extreme events which may overtop the flood defense systems and stress disaster management however the estimation of extreme floods based either on observed streamflow or observed precipitation via hydrological modeling is highly uncertain one approach to mitigate this problem is derived flood frequency analysis introduced by eagleson 1972 its general idea is to combine stochastic models of precipitation with hydrological models to estimate the flood peak distribution or flood frequency curve this idea was introduced in an event based framework but has been extended to continuous simulation e g cameron et al 1999 blazkova and beven 2004 haberlandt and radtke 2014 here long synthetic meteorological time series are generated to drive a continuous hydrological model the flood peak distribution is then derived from the synthetic streamflow time series continuous simulation has the advantage that the complete flood hydrograph is simulated and that it includes the links of flood peaks to the antecedent catchment states this approach has been further extended by including hydrodynamic models grimaldi et al 2013 and models of flood defense failure and damage falter et al 2015 the latter approach termed derived flood risk analysis based on continuous simulation is particularly informative for discussing risk reduction measures as it simulates the complete process cascade from the triggering hydro meteorological events rainfall runoff processes at the catchment scale down to river and floodplain inundation processes as well as damage processes falter et al 2015 falter et al 2016 different types of stochastic models so called weather generators wgs are used to obtain synthetic hydro meteorological time series in particular for precipitation weather generators can be subdivided into single site and multi site models single site models do not account for the spatial correlation structure of the target variables at multiple sites whereas it is considered in multi site models haberlandt et al 2011 and serinaldi and kilsby 2014 distinguish between the following types of weather generators 1 alternating renewal models which simulate dry and wet spell durations and wet spell precipitation intensity using various probability distribution functions e g haberlandt 1998 these models are particularly suitable for the simulation of sub daily rainfall series 2 most commonly applied are time series models which exist in a large variety precipitation series are therein considered as a realization of a stochastic process which can be described mathematically including temporal and spatial dependence between the series elements these models can be further subdivided into a markov chain based richardson type wgs b serial type wgs and c linear type models combining the parametric simulation of precipitation intensities and imposing correlation structure conditioned on observations a c in a markov chains are used to simulate daily precipitation occurrence wet dry and are then combined with a distribution function e g gamma exponential to model precipitation intensity on wet days richardson 1981 wilks 1998 serial type weather generators b use distribution functions e g empirical distributions instead of a markov chain to simulate the precipitation occurrence state wet dry racsko et al 1991 semenov et al 1998 both models a b can be extended for considering the spatial correlation structure of precipitation linear type models c simultaneously simulate occurrence and intensity of precipitation by latent gaussian process bardossy and plate 1992 hundecha et al 2009 kleiber et al 2012 for instance the auto regressive ar 1 models by bardossy and plate 1992 and hundecha et al 2009 use distribution functions for generating the spatially correlated precipitation amounts at multiple sites whereas the values below a certain cut off point are treated as dry days further developments of time series models considering spatial rainfall dependence include for instance a combination of markov chain and generalized additive model along with spatio temporal meta gaussian random fields serinaldi and kilsby 2014 3 resampling based weather generators e g based on the k nearest neighbour technique rajagopalan and lall 1999 buishand and brandsma 2001 apipattanavis et al 2007 generate a time series by sampling precipitation at multiple locations simultaneously for one time step e g day by selecting one of the k most similar days in the historical records this wg type implicitly retains the spatial correlation structure between multiple sites for each time step and does not require a parametric modeling of rainfall intensities at individual sites this comes at the expense that daily extremes going beyond observations cannot be generated without deliberate modifications however multi day extremes generation is still possible 4 point process models such as the neymann scott rectangular pulse model cowpertwait 1994 1995 fowler et al 2005 simulate rainfall events as the arrival process of rectangular pulses this type of weather generator is typically applied at sub daily temporal resolution further developments of stochastic rainfall models include the spatio temporal models which simulate storm arrival temporal and spatial evolution of precipitation fields and intensities by stochastic processes pegram and clothier 2001 paschalis et al 2013 finally a class of multi fractal models has been developed over the past decades e g gires et al 2013 as different types of weather generators co exist and are individually evaluated against observations using various performance statistics it is difficult to judge which type is most suitable for which application only very few studies compare the performance of different wg types we briefly summarize these studies focusing on the assessment of precipitation simulation in the late 9 0s semenov et al 1998 compared two single site weather generators across various climatic conditions in the us europe and asia due to unconsidered auto correlation of precipitation amounts in these earlier models they reveal difficulties even to reproduce the annual variability similar studies of single site model comparisons are reported by soltani and hoogenboom 2003 where two serial type models with different parameter estimation methods are benchmarked and by qian et al 2004 comparing a second order 2 state markov chain type to a serial type weather generator recently mehan et al 2017 analyzed the performance of three single site models and chen and brissette 2014 and vu et al 2018 of five single site wgs of different complexity with regards to wet dry frequency spell duration and precipitation intensity statistics single site weather generators are generally unsuitable for flood risk assessments plausible spatially correlated precipitation fields are of paramount importance for the representation of spatially distributed flood generation processes and the associated losses lamb et al 2010 metin et al 2020 the spatial correlation of flood peaks does not only play a role at the local and catchment scales but is also of importance for trans basin floods uhlemann et al 2010 kemter et al 2020 hence we do not further discuss single site models here in detail to our best knowledge the only comparison of three multi site weather generators has been performed by mehrotra et al 2006 for an area in southern australia they benchmark the performance of a parametric hidden markov model hmm hughes and guttorp 1994 a multi site generalization of a richardson type wg wilks 1998 and a non parametric k nearest neighbour knn resampling model the study compares the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation based on 100 realizations of each of the three models at 30 climate stations with the inter site distance varying between 20 and 340 km the spatial precipitation occurrence is assessed by the log odds ratio mehrotra et al 2006 while the knn and richardson type wg equally excel in the reproduction of the log odds ratios hmm significantly underestimates those the wet spell probability of different durations is best captured by the richardson type model dry spell durations are more challenging for all models but the richardson type wg outperforms the other two models here as well overall the richardson type model is found to reproduce the precipitation occurrence best for the target region however the local temporal and spatial performance in terms of precipitation amounts is not compared this summary reveals that so far no study has been published which comprehensively compares the performance of different multi site weather generators in terms of precipitation occurrence magnitude and areal amounts focusing on the suitability for large scale flood estimations and risk assessments to fill this gap we compare two fundamentally different approaches underlying weather generators a multi site auto regressive weather generator awg based on a mixture of the gamma and generalized pareto distributions hundecha et al 2009 to a raster based resampling type weather generator rwg beersma and buishand 2003 the first one follows a parametric approach where the space time dynamics of the climate variables are represented by functional relationships whereas the latter is based on the resampling of observed climate data while preserving the spatial correlation structure of climate fields our comparison aims to investigate the trade offs when selecting a certain approach we assess the ability of both models to reproduce the observed precipitation statistics but also to generate extreme values beyond the observed ranges on single and multiple days the performance in simulating the spatial correlation structure resulting in realistic areal rainfall patterns is also evaluated this is particularly challenging for large scales where the correlation structure is difficult to capture given the highly variable nature of precipitation including its intermittency the analysis is therefore carried out for one of the large river basins in europe the rhine catchment 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area with a total river length of 1 233 km and a drainage area of approximately 185 000 km2 the rhine catchment ranges among the ten largest eurasian river basins icpr 2015 the rhine and its main tributaries the aare neckar main and moselle form one of the economically most important waterways in europe due to the high level of industrialization throughout the river basin and its population of approximately 60 million inhabitants icpr 2015 uehlinger et al 2009 geographically the main river can be divided into six sections from upstream to downstream fig 1 the alpine high upper middle lower and the delta rhine where the river enters the north sea at the port of rotterdam hegnauer et al 2014 the basin topography ranges from high elevations up to 2500m asl in the alps via the german highland area 150 700 m asl in the moselle basin to the lowland area in the northern part middelkoop et al 2001 the elevation gradients result in different hydrological characteristics of the sub basins nival regimes in the alpine and high rhine show low discharges in winter due to ice and snow accumulation and higher discharges in spring and summer when snow melt occurs the pluvial regime of the neckar main and moselle tributaries prevails the runoff regime in the middle rhine here peak runoff occurs in late winter spring and lower discharges are observed in summer autumn due to the overlap of both regimes nival and pluvial more uniform discharge distributions throughout the year define the combined runoff regime of the main river downstream belz 2007 belz 2010 in the recent past two severe floods occurred in december 1993 and january 1995 originating in the pluvial regimes of upper and middle rhine the co occurrence of high runoff volumes due to intense precipitation in most tributaries of the pluvial regime caused great damage in parts of the middle lower and delta rhine the accumulated damage for both flood events accounted to 2 billion dm in the german part of the basin only disse 2004 due to expected increased precipitation intensities and higher temperatures in the winter half year the pluvial regime may stretch further south and strengthen the trend to winter flooding in the rhine basin belz 2010 disse 2004 to keep future flood damages bearable it is necessary to constantly improve the risk assessment methodologies and regularly update the risk adaptation and mitigation measures klijn et al 2012 2 2 meteorological data 2 2 1 input datasets the weather generators are based on different meteorological datasets the awg is parametrized on station based daily data provided by the potsdam institute for climate impact research pik the pik dataset comprises homogenized time series of precipitation from stations of the german weather service and the swiss federal office for meteorology and climatology for the period 1951 2003 österle et al 2006 wechsung et al 2013 due to lack of available station data in the french part of the rhine basin grid based e obs precipitation data on a 0 25 0 25 grid haylock et al 2008 are used for that area these grid points are added to the pik dataset and treated as stations in total 208 stations are used in the rhine basin the rwg is based on the high resolution gridded hyras dataset provided by the german weather service deutscher wetterdienst 2018 hyras comprises precipitation records at over 4000 stations in central europe covering the period 1951 2006 deutscher wetterdienst 2018 for the interpolation from station data to a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km the regnie method is applied by the german weather service that combines multiple linear regression and inverse distance weighting rauthe et al 2013 2 2 2 comparison of input data to ensure a fair evaluation of the performance of weather generators their input datasets must be comparable the similarity in key statistics of the input datasets is evaluated at the local scale and serves as a basis for the wg comparison we compare the following statistics whereby the closest hyras grid point to each pik station is selected for comparison daily mean precipitation daily extreme precipitation 99 9th percentile wet to dry transition probabilities wet day frequencies these statistics are calculated by taking all daily values separately for each month for the time period 1951 2003 overlapping time period for pik and hyras datasets for instance for a 53 year series consisting of all daily precipitation values in june 53 30 1590 the 99 9th percentile is computed according to the weibull plotting positions makkonen 2006 additionally the mean absolute error mae of daily extreme precipitation between both datasets is evaluated to identify possible patterns of high deviations and their dependence on elevation while daily means and extremes depict precipitation intensity transition probabilities and wet frequencies describe the occurrence of precipitation transition probabilities are a measure for sequence and fragmentation of wet and dry spells with two alternative states wet dry four combinations on two subsequent days are possible wet to dry wet to wet dry to wet and dry to dry the wet to dry transition probability thus represents the probability of a dry day following a wet day the wet day frequency displays the share of wet days recorded during the regarded time period the precipitation threshold for considering a day as wet is set to 0 1 mm these statistics are presented for nine selected pik stations in the rhine catchment see table 1 shown in fig 1 these stations are chosen to represent all parts of the rhine basin and different altitudes 2 3 weather generators in this study we compare two weather generators of different types a multi site latent gaussian auto regressive model hundecha et al 2009 and a nearest neighbour resampling weather generator beersma and buishand 2003 2 3 1 weather generator approaches the awg simulates the precipitation occurrence and amounts at the locations of individual station using a latent gaussian auto regressive model considering spatial covariance structure bardossy and plate 1992 hundecha et al 2009 the distribution of precipitation amount considering dry days at a single station location is described by eq 1 1 h x u 1 p w p w f x u where h x u is the cumulative distribution of the non negative precipitation amount x at location u p w represents the wet frequency conversely 1 p w stands for the probability of zero precipitation and f x is the cumulative distribution of the non zero precipitation amount f x is assumed to be a mixed distribution wherein the bulk of rainfall amount is modeled using the gamma distribution and extremes are represented by the generalized pareto gp distribution the mixture model reads 2 f x u 1 m x u g x u m x u p x u k u where f x u is the probability density function of mixed distribution m x u is the mixing weight given in eq 3 frigessi et al 2002 g x u and p x u are the probability density functions of gamma and gp distributions respectively k u is the normalizing constant given in eq 4 3 m x u 1 2 1 π arctan x υ u τ u where υ u and τ u are the location and steepness parameters 4 k u 1 1 π 0 p x u g x u arctan x υ u τ u dx in total six parameters two for each distribution and two for the mixture model need to be estimated for every month and station the multisite precipitation is modelled using the multivariate autoregressive model 5 w t bw t 1 c ψ t where w t is the multivariate standard normal distribution at time t and w t w t u 1 w t u n with marginal distributions at n locations ψ t ψ t u 1 ψ t u n is a random vector of independent normally distributed random variables with zero mean and unit variance matrices b and c are related to lag 0 and lag 1 correlation matrices m 0 m 1 of w t as follows 6 b m 1 m 0 1 7 cc t m 0 bm 1 t where c t and m 1 t are transposed matrices in practice large correlation matrices in eqs 6 and 7 are usually not well defined and hence need to be corrected therefore an isotropic spatial correlation function is assumed where the correlation only depends on the distance between stations bardossy and plate 1992 hundecha et al 2009 finally eqs 1 and 5 are linked through the following relationship 8 φ w t u h x t u where φ is a cumulative distribution of the standard normal variate for further details on the awg the reader is referred to hundecha et al 2009 the rwg reshuffles the observed daily precipitation fields for the entire domain into a new order to generate synthetic series the spatial correlation of the precipitation fields is thus preserved for each day the auto correlation for the synthetic series is considered by seeking for analogue historical patterns of the previously simulated day beersma and buishand 2003 hegnauer et al 2014 hence the sequence of synthetic fields is generated by sampling the next day from the k nearest subset of neighbours days nearest neighbours are determined by assessing the auto correlation and data similarity of the historical records in the entire domain within a selected time window e g same calendar month beersma and buishand 2003 the new sequence of precipitation values only includes values within the range of historical observations single day extremes going beyond historical records are thus not generated however multi day extreme precipitation can still exceed observed multi day maxima if several reshuffled days with high precipitation follow each other the limitation on single day extremes at the monthly time scale can be relaxed by choosing a wide time window of a few months for selecting the nearest neighbours hegnauer et al 2014 2 3 2 weather generator configuration we condition the awg on the daily precipitation pik station dataset at each station we generate 100 realizations of synthetic daily precipitation series of 53 years length i e the same length as observations for the rwg the gridded hyras precipitation is aggregated to areal precipitation for 134 rhine sub basins in order to simplify and accelerate the generation of synthetic precipitation fields hence a one day precipitation field in rwg is represented by 134 values of mean sub basin precipitation the k nearest neighbour selection and reshuffling algorithms are run on the sub basin scale likewise 100 realization of daily precipitation series of 53 years are produced by the rwg awg and rwg operate on different spatial scales i e station and sub basin scale respectively hence the output needs to be compared at the same spatial scale which is the sub basin scale thus we interpolate the time series of the awg onto a 1 km 1 km raster and aggregate the output to 134 sub basin areal precipitation series for the comparison of simulated areal precipitation with observed records also the historical station records are interpolated and aggregated in the same manner we apply the regnie interpolation method which was also used to generate the hyras dataset used by rwg rauthe et al 2013 regnie method is based on a combination of the multiple linear regression mlr and inverse distance weighting idw mlr is applied to compute monthly background fields of precipitation conditioned on the explanatory variables longitude latitude elevation slope and aspect in the generation of the hyras dataset climate stations are clustered according to their climatological characteristics in producing specific background fields rauthe et al 2013 due to the lower number of stations in the pik dataset cluster analysis is not expected to strongly improve the interpolation results for the rhine basin we therefore omit this step and use all stations in the background field calculation for the generation of daily precipitation fields the observed daily precipitation at each station is divided by the value of the respective background field the resulting ratio is interpolated to grid points without observations using idw with parabolic weights finally daily precipitation at unobserved location is obtained by multiplying the ratio with the respective value of the background field 2 3 3 weather generator performance evaluation given the comparable input data the performance of the two weather generators to reproduce observed weather statistics is assessed at the same time we benchmark two different models and discuss their strengths and weaknesses for both weather generators we compute and evaluate the same statistics as observational datasets additionally annual maximum multi day precipitation sums over 5 10 and 20 days are compared at basin scale the comparison of multi day extremes aims at evaluating flood events caused by prolonged rainfall over consecutive days based on an unbounded extreme value distribution the awg is capable of generating extreme events higher than the observations even on the daily scale extremes exceeding observations in the rwg can only be generated through a sequence of successive high precipitation values multi day maxima multi day maxima are analyzed against their return periods t computed with the weibull plotting positions makkonen 2006 and compared to observed multi day maxima from 53 year long series the overall comparison scheme at various spatial scales is depicted in fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of input datasets this section compares the precipitation intensity and occurrence statistics of the employed input datasets at station locations the daily mean precipitation in both datasets is nearly identical not shown and is not further discussed here fig 3 presents the results for extreme precipitation 99 9th percentile at nine selected stations pik and hyras datasets are in good agreement with each other at low elevations at higher elevations the differences between station based pik and raster based hyras datasets tend to increase for stations ur2 and ar the slightly higher station based precipitation has to be expected due to the smoothed topography in the gridded dataset when average elevation of a raster cell 1 km 1 km is taken grillakis et al 2010 hession and moore 2011 this pattern is visible when comparing the mae of daily extreme precipitation across all stations in fig 4 the highest mae values are found at a few stations in the high elevation alpine region and the french part of the basin we recall that in the french part the coarse gridded e obs precipitation data are integrated into the pik dataset since station records are not available in this region these higher errors can therefore be explained by the lower spatial resolution of the e obs dataset which tends to underestimate the station based records overall both pik and hyras datasets are comparable with regards to the mean and extreme daily precipitation magnitudes fig 5 shows a close agreement of wet to dry transition probabilities between pik and hyras datasets without a systematic bias the deviations are very small and do not depend on the station elevation or location note the small range of the y axis however we observe a small systematic difference in wet day frequencies of 2 to 5 percent points at all station locations fig 6 hyras constantly shows slightly higher wet day frequencies given comparable wet to dry transition probabilities this implies a slightly longer duration of wet spells in the hyras dataset this can partly be explained by the effect that small scale precipitation events may not be captured at some pik stations but may still result in wet raster cells in the interpolated hyras dataset moreover the hyras dataset contains considerably more stations than the pik dataset so the probability of wet cells after interpolation is higher compared to the probability of precipitation occurrence at each individual pik station stations in higher elevations with larger daily precipitation lr2 hr ar tend to display a greater intra annual variability of wet frequencies this is consistent in both datasets in total we consider the datasets very similar as there are only some deviations in daily extreme precipitation at some high elevation locations and a small bias towards higher wet frequency in the hyras dataset these differences can be explained by the difference in the type of the datasets i e station based vs raster based we expect these differences to not significantly affect the performance of the weather generators 3 2 performance of weather generators the synthetic precipitation series from the weather generators are evaluated at different scales first the awg is assessed at the locations of the climate stations by comparing its performance statistics with those of the observed pik dataset since the output of the rwg is only available as daily areal precipitation for 134 sub basins its performance cannot be assessed at station locations hence in the second step awg and rwg are evaluated at the sub basin scale this reveals the ability of both models to simulate areal precipitation and to resemble the spatial correlation structure to this end the awg output is interpolated and aggregated to the sub basin scale as described in section 2 finally multi day extremes are evaluated at the basin scale 3 2 1 awg performance at station locations daily mean precipitation is very well captured by the awg not shown which can be expected for a state of the art stochastic precipitation model similarly the daily extreme precipitation 99 9th percentile is well reproduced and lies within the range of simulated values at all stations in all months fig 7 there is little bias between simulated and observed extreme precipitation for some stations and months e g in december at ur2 in march at lr2 or in may at hr very large values of extreme precipitation are generated on one side these large values may underline the ability of the awg to generate extremes that have never been observed on the other side a high uncertainty remains concerning these extremes due to the limited data length and hence limited comparability of the observational time period the question of how realistic these extremes are cannot be answered with certainty model structure errors and parameter uncertainty can also lead to overshooting and generation of outliers we detect a systematic bias of the awg towards an overestimation of the wet to dry transition probabilities fig 8 the overestimation is more pronounced in higher elevations in contrast the awg almost perfectly represents the observed wet day frequencies in all seasons at all nine stations fig 9 hence we conclude that the number of wet days is well reproduced but the wet spells are more fragmented i e separated by dry spells in the synthetic time series this discrepancy should not affect single day extremes but may lead to an underestimation of multi day extreme precipitation overall the at site performance of the awg can be regarded as very good despite slight problems in capturing precipitation intermittency which is not expected to significantly affect flood hazard 3 2 2 performance of the weather generators at the sub basin and basin scale overall daily mean precipitation is well captured by awg and rwg though awg tends to underestimate observed areal precipitation at some sub basins throughout the year not shown the comparison of the 99 9th percentiles of sub basin precipitation for both weather generators and corresponding observations fig 10 reveals a contrasting picture to the station based evaluation the awg tends to overestimate the observed areal precipitation particularly visible for sub basins bodensee lowrhine4 and main7 whereas for the rwg no systematic overestimation is detected also the range of awg simulated precipitation is often larger than that of the rwg whereas the latter can be expected due to the unconstrained distribution functions used in the awg the clear overestimation of observed areal extremes is of concern taking into account the satisfactory performance of the awg at individual stations we explain the overestimation of the areal precipitation by an overestimation of the spatial correlation particularly for extreme events this has also been reported for other weather generators which use an isotropic correlation function serinaldi and kilsby 2014 the spatial correlation is parametrized using the entire observed precipitation dataset however extreme precipitation tends to have shorter correlation distances than the bulk of precipitation mueller and haberlandt 2015 applying an isotropic correlation function results in more extremes occurring simultaneously at multiple sites this consequently leads to higher areal precipitation simulated by the awg the overestimation of areal precipitation by the awg is particularly pronounced during the summer months we explain this by the dominance of convective storms on extreme rainfall during that season in the observations these extremes are localized whereas in the awg synthetic data they become much more extended the overestimation is detected in the lowland sub basins as well as in high elevations a comparison between observed areal precipitation in the interpolated pik and hyras datasets reveals higher values in the hyras in all sub basins throughout almost all months this finding can be ascribed to the effect of interpolation and the higher station density in the hyras dataset accordingly the difference between the simulated areal precipitation generated by the awg and rwg varies across sub basins some sub basins show predominantly higher values in the rwg results kleine emme lowrhine4 umos1 others exhibit the opposite lahn4 bodensee this observation reflects the different extents to which the aspects discussed above impact the weather generation across sub basins the benchmarking of the weather generator performance at the sub basin scale reveals a weakness of the awg in correctly representing the spatial correlation structure for different event magnitudes the awg systematically overestimates observed areal precipitation however due to higher observed areal precipitation in the hyras dataset due to a denser observation network the rwg synthetic extreme precipitation is comparable to that generated by the awg hence the overestimation of the correlation structure in the awg is partly compensated for during the interpolation and sub basin aggregation steps compared to the rwg approach the wet to dry transition probabilities at the sub basin scale are slightly higher for the hyras dataset compared to the interpolated pik data fig 11 meaning that the wet spells in the hyras observations are more fragmented both weather generators tend to overshoot the wet to dry transition probabilities in the synthetically generated series the overestimation of the awg is however more pronounced which is consistent with the overestimation at the locations of the individual stations we do not detect any significant seasonal variation in the bias in wet frequencies and transition probabilities the observed wet frequencies in the interpolated and aggregated pik dataset are somewhat higher than those in hyras for all analyzed sub basins fig 12 whereas at the locations of the individual stations the wet frequencies are very similar fig 6 the difference emerges at the sub basin scale and is likely introduced during the interpolation procedure and lower station density in the pik dataset this assumption is confirmed when comparing both observations at a threshold for wet days of 1 mm day not shown where discrepancies almost completely disappear with a slightly higher threshold less contributing stations need to record precipitation to count as wet which balances the lower station density of pik the rwg captures the observed wet frequencies of the respective observational dataset well at the sub basin scale while the awg slightly overshoots them despite the good performance at the station locations apparently overestimated correlation of high precipitation leads to a simultaneous occurrence of precipitation at multiple locations and consequently to high fractions of wet days when aggregated to the sub basin scale higher frequency of wet days may contribute to longer wet spells but also to higher wet to dry transition probabilities the latter could partially explain the stronger deviations of wet to dry transition probabilities between pik and awg fig 11 at the scale of the entire rhine basin the multi day maximum precipitation frequencies for sums over 5 10 and 20 days are strongly overestimated by the awg approach fig 13 compared to the observations therein awg seems to stronger overshoot the observed maximum precipitation for the 5 day aggregation compared to 10 and 20 days likely individual spatially extended extreme precipitation events which are overestimated by the awg have stronger weight in the 5 day precipitation sum compared to the other two aggregation periods rwg captures the observations generally well it is capable of producing slightly higher multi day precipitation sums than the observations towards larger return periods however rwg has a slight tendency to underestimate the observations for the precipitation sums of 10 and 20 subsequent days hegnauer et al 2014 point out to the underestimated auto correlation of daily precipitation by the rwg this temporal dependence affects extreme rainfall intensities strongly and would require the implementation of a long memory term to be fully reproduced notably the multi day maximum precipitation frequencies of both observational datasets pik and hyras are nearly the same when aggregated to the entire rhine basin it is likely that the larger wet day frequencies and lower fragmentation of wet spells in the interpolated pik dataset contribute to balance its generally lower precipitation intensities fig 10 when aggregated to multi day sums with increasing return period the deviation between rwg and awg results increases we explain this by the overestimation of the areal extreme precipitation by the awg which becomes more pronounced for lower probabilities also the underestimation by the rwg contributes to the discrepancy overall the awg model performs very well at the individual locations but exhibits problems in correctly representing the spatial correlation structure of extreme precipitation particularly in the summer months this leads to a considerable overestimation of the areal statistics such as wet frequencies and extreme precipitation at the sub basin scale and multi day extremes for the entire rhine basin other weather generators of the time series type show a similar weakness serinaldi and kilsby 2014 we attribute this to the use of an average isotropic correlation function applied to generate both low magnitude and extreme events extreme rainfalls are often produced by local convective storms and have rather short correlation distances low magnitude precipitation events have larger spatial footprints and correlation distances mueller and haberlandt 2015 this behaviour explains the stronger overestimation of the areal precipitation in summer when the convective storms typically occur we recommend an adjustment of the spatial correlation structure simulated by the awg for bulk and extreme precipitation two different functions can be used below and above a certain threshold which should be tested in future research the rwg has an advantage to implicitly retain the spatial correlation of precipitation by reshuffling observed precipitation fields rwg performs well in all statistics at the sub basin scale only wet to dry transition probabilities are slightly overestimated which hints to higher fragmentation of wet spells than in the observed hyras dataset following the findings of e g apipattanavis et al 2007 or kleiber et al 2012 an implementation of a three state first order markov chain prior to the resampling weather generation may improve the reproduction of wet and dry spells the overshooting is however by far smaller than for the awg the slight underestimation of multi day precipitation extremes may be overcome by including a memory element in the weather generation however this temporal correlation might then lead to weaker reproductions of the other precipitation statistics which are not so strongly affected by it hegnauer et al 2014 the variability of generated extreme precipitation at the sub basin scale is much smaller for the rwg compared to the awg the main aim of the weather generators is to capture the natural variability of precipitation which is unknown and can only be approximately sensed by very long instrumental records in a stationary climate neither is the climate stationary nor are instrumental records available over large areas for long periods thus it remains difficult to estimate what the true range of natural variability in precipitation series is and which weather generator approach is better able to represent the reality the rwg is limited to generate daily extremes beyond the maximum observed record in the past but was shown to generate multi day extremes exceeding the observed maxima though the awg is capable of generating extremes at different time scales exceeding the observed records by far due to the unlimited nature of the underlying distributions the areal extremes may be unrealistic due to an overestimation of the spatial correlation the awg tends to produce more precipitation simultaneously at multiple sites to sense the physical limits for maximum precipitation estimation of probable maximum precipitation either using statistical approaches hershfield 1961 hershfield 1965 douglas and barros 2003 or physically based climate modeling ohara et al 2011 ishida et al 2015 chen et al 2017 should be further explored this could set another benchmark for evaluating weather generators and their ability to capture the natural variability of precipitation 4 conclusions in this study we assess and benchmark the performance of a multi site auto regressive weather generator awg and a raster based resampling weather generator rwg in estimating spatially consistent rainfall fields and their temporal variability in the rhine catchment awg and rwg are conditioned on a station based dataset pik and a raster based dataset hyras respectively the datasets are found comparable at the locations of individual stations but differences in wet day probabilities wet to dry transition probabilities and extreme precipitation magnitudes are revealed when the pik dataset is interpolated and aggregated to the sub basin scale we explain this by the different station density and deviations in the implementation of the interpolation procedure e g different dems the station based awg excels in producing daily precipitation statistics at the local scale but overestimates the spatial correlation of extremes as a consequence the estimates of single day and multi day extremes overshoot the observed values a better estimation of spatial correlations for extreme rainfall is required for the awg to realistically estimate flood risk the rwg captures the observed single and multi day extreme precipitation magnitudes well with a slight underestimation of generated multi day extremes its ranges are found to show lower variability than those from awg generated series however how well both models reproduce the range of natural variability remains open and further research is recommended to integrate probable

4266,stochastic modeling of precipitation for estimation of hydrological extremes is an important element of flood risk assessment and management the spatially consistent estimation of rainfall fields and their temporal variability remains challenging and is addressed by various stochastic weather generators in this study two types of weather generators are evaluated against observed data and benchmarked regarding their ability to simulate spatio temporal precipitation fields in the rhine catchment a multi site station based weather generator uses an auto regressive model and estimates the spatial correlation structure between stations another weather generator is raster based and uses the nearest neighbor resampling technique for reshuffling daily patterns while preserving the correlation structure between the observations both weather generators perform well and are comparable at the point station scale with regards to daily mean and 99 9th percentile precipitation as well as concerning wet dry frequencies and transition probabilities the areal extreme precipitation at the sub basin scale is however overestimated in the station based weather generator due to an overestimation of the correlation structure between individual stations the auto regressive model tends to generate larger rainfall fields in space for extreme precipitation than observed particularly in summer the weather generator based on nearest neighbor resampling reproduces the observed daily and multi day 5 10 and 20 extreme events in a similar magnitude improvements in performance regarding wet frequencies and transition probabilities are recommended for both models keywords rainfall generation rainfall occurrence multi site stochastic weather generator resampling weather generator time series analysis 1 introduction floods affect more people than any other natural hazard and the annual average loss has been estimated to be around us 100 billion un 2015 to develop ffective risk management strategies flood magnitudes associated losses and probabilities have to be quantified it is particularly important to include extreme events which may overtop the flood defense systems and stress disaster management however the estimation of extreme floods based either on observed streamflow or observed precipitation via hydrological modeling is highly uncertain one approach to mitigate this problem is derived flood frequency analysis introduced by eagleson 1972 its general idea is to combine stochastic models of precipitation with hydrological models to estimate the flood peak distribution or flood frequency curve this idea was introduced in an event based framework but has been extended to continuous simulation e g cameron et al 1999 blazkova and beven 2004 haberlandt and radtke 2014 here long synthetic meteorological time series are generated to drive a continuous hydrological model the flood peak distribution is then derived from the synthetic streamflow time series continuous simulation has the advantage that the complete flood hydrograph is simulated and that it includes the links of flood peaks to the antecedent catchment states this approach has been further extended by including hydrodynamic models grimaldi et al 2013 and models of flood defense failure and damage falter et al 2015 the latter approach termed derived flood risk analysis based on continuous simulation is particularly informative for discussing risk reduction measures as it simulates the complete process cascade from the triggering hydro meteorological events rainfall runoff processes at the catchment scale down to river and floodplain inundation processes as well as damage processes falter et al 2015 falter et al 2016 different types of stochastic models so called weather generators wgs are used to obtain synthetic hydro meteorological time series in particular for precipitation weather generators can be subdivided into single site and multi site models single site models do not account for the spatial correlation structure of the target variables at multiple sites whereas it is considered in multi site models haberlandt et al 2011 and serinaldi and kilsby 2014 distinguish between the following types of weather generators 1 alternating renewal models which simulate dry and wet spell durations and wet spell precipitation intensity using various probability distribution functions e g haberlandt 1998 these models are particularly suitable for the simulation of sub daily rainfall series 2 most commonly applied are time series models which exist in a large variety precipitation series are therein considered as a realization of a stochastic process which can be described mathematically including temporal and spatial dependence between the series elements these models can be further subdivided into a markov chain based richardson type wgs b serial type wgs and c linear type models combining the parametric simulation of precipitation intensities and imposing correlation structure conditioned on observations a c in a markov chains are used to simulate daily precipitation occurrence wet dry and are then combined with a distribution

instance the auto regressive ar 1 models by bardossy and plate 1992 and hundecha et al 2009 use distribution functions for generating the spatially correlated precipitation amounts at multiple sites whereas the values below a certain cut off point are treated as dry days further developments of time series models considering spatial rainfall dependence include for instance a combination of markov chain and generalized additive model along with spatio temporal meta gaussian random fields serinaldi and kilsby 2014 3 resampling based weather generators e g based on the k nearest neighbour technique rajagopalan and lall 1999 buishand and brandsma 2001 apipattanavis et al 2007 generate a time series by sampling precipitation at multiple locations simultaneously for one time step e g day by selecting one of the k most similar days in the historical records this wg type implicitly retains the spatial correlation structure between multiple sites for each time step and does not require a parametric modeling of rainfall intensities at individual sites this comes at the expense that daily extremes going beyond observations cannot be generated without deliberate modifications however multi day extremes generation is still possible 4 point process models such as the neymann scott rectangular pulse model cowpertwait 1994 1995 fowler et al 2005 simulate rainfall events as the arrival process of rectangular pulses this type of weather generator is typically applied at sub daily temporal resolution further developments of stochastic rainfall models include the spatio temporal models which simulate storm arrival temporal and spatial evolution of precipitation fields and intensities by stochastic processes pegram and clothier 2001 paschalis et al 2013 finally a class of multi fractal models has been developed over the past decades e g gires et al 2013 as different types of weather generators co exist and are individually evaluated against observations using various performance statistics it is difficult to judge which type is most suitable for which application only very few studies compare the performance of different wg types we briefly summarize these studies focusing on the assessment of precipitation simulation in the late 9 0s semenov et al 1998 compared two single site weather generators across various climatic conditions in the us europe and asia due to unconsidered auto correlation of precipitation amounts in these earlier models they reveal difficulties even to reproduce the annual variability similar studies of single site model comparisons are reported by soltani and hoogenboom 2003 where two serial type models with different parameter estimation methods are benchmarked and by qian et al 2004 comparing a second order 2 state markov chain type to a serial type weather generator recently mehan et al 2017 analyzed the performance of three single site models and chen and brissette 2014 and vu et al 2018 of five single site wgs of different complexity with regards to wet dry frequency spell duration and precipitation intensity statistics single site weather generators are generally unsuitable for flood risk assessments plausible spatially correlated precipitation fields are of paramount importance for the representation of spatially distributed flood generation processes and the associated losses lamb et al 2010 metin et al 2020 the spatial correlation of flood peaks does not only play a role at the local and catchment scales but is also of importance for trans basin floods uhlemann et al 2010 kemter et al 2020 hence we do not further discuss single site models here in detail to our best knowledge the only comparison of three multi site weather generators has been performed by mehrotra et al 2006 for an area in southern australia they benchmark the performance of a parametric hidden markov model hmm hughes and guttorp 1994 a multi site generalization of a richardson type wg wilks 1998 and a non parametric k nearest neighbour knn resampling model the study compares the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation based on 100 realizations of each of the three models at 30 climate stations with the inter site distance varying between 20 and 340 km the spatial precipitation occurrence is assessed by the log odds ratio mehrotra et al 2006 while the knn and richardson type wg equally excel in the reproduction of the log odds ratios hmm significantly underestimates those the wet spell probability of different durations is best captured by the richardson type model dry spell durations are more challenging for all models but the richardson type wg outperforms the other two models here as well overall the richardson type model is found to reproduce the precipitation occurrence best for the target region however the local temporal and spatial performance in terms of precipitation amounts is not compared this summary reveals that so far no study has been published which comprehensively compares the performance of different multi site weather generators in terms of precipitation occurrence magnitude and areal amounts focusing on the suitability for large scale flood estimations and risk assessments to fill this gap we compare two fundamentally different approaches underlying weather generators a multi site auto regressive weather generator awg based on a mixture of the gamma and generalized pareto distributions hundecha et al 2009 to a raster based resampling type weather generator rwg beersma and buishand 2003 the first one follows a parametric approach where the space time dynamics of the climate variables are represented by functional relationships whereas the latter is based on the resampling of observed climate data while preserving the spatial correlation structure of climate fields our comparison aims to investigate the trade offs when selecting a certain approach we assess the ability of both models to reproduce the observed precipitation statistics but also to generate extreme values beyond the observed ranges on single and multiple days the performance in simulating the spatial correlation structure resulting in realistic areal rainfall patterns is also evaluated this is particularly challenging for large scales where the correlation structure is difficult to capture given the highly variable nature of precipitation including its intermittency the analysis is therefore carried out for one of the large river basins in europe the rhine catchment 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area with a total river length of 1 233 km and a drainage area of approximately 185 000 km2 the rhine catchment ranges among the ten largest eurasian river basins icpr 2015 the rhine and its main tributaries the aare neckar main and moselle form one of the economically most important waterways in europe due to the high level of industrialization throughout the river basin and its population of approximately 60 million inhabitants icpr 2015 uehlinger et al 2009 geographically the main river can be divided into six sections from upstream to downstream fig 1 the alpine high upper middle lower and the delta rhine where the river enters the north sea at the port of rotterdam hegnauer et al 2014 the basin topography ranges from high elevations up to 2500m asl in the alps via the german highland area 150 700 m asl in the moselle basin to the lowland area in the northern part middelkoop et al 2001 the elevation gradients result in different hydrological characteristics of the sub basins nival regimes in the alpine and high rhine show low discharges in winter due to ice and snow accumulation and higher discharges in spring and summer when snow melt occurs the pluvial regime of the neckar main and moselle tributaries prevails the runoff regime in the middle rhine here peak runoff occurs in late winter spring and lower discharges are observed in summer autumn due to the overlap of both regimes nival and pluvial more uniform discharge distributions throughout the year define the combined runoff regime of the main river downstream belz 2007 belz 2010 in the recent past two severe floods occurred in december 1993 and january 1995 originating in the pluvial regimes of upper and middle rhine the co occurrence of high runoff volumes due to intense precipitation in most tributaries of the pluvial regime caused great damage in parts of the middle lower and delta rhine the accumulated damage for both flood events accounted to 2 billion dm in the german part of the basin only disse 2004 due to expected increased precipitation intensities and higher temperatures in the winter half year the pluvial regime may stretch further south and strengthen the trend to winter flooding in the rhine basin belz 2010 disse 2004 to keep future flood damages bearable it is necessary to constantly improve the risk assessment methodologies and regularly update the risk adaptation and mitigation measures klijn et al 2012 2 2 meteorological data 2 2 1 input datasets the weather generators are based on different meteorological datasets the awg is parametrized on station based daily data provided by the potsdam institute for climate impact research pik the pik dataset comprises homogenized time series of precipitation from stations of the german weather service and the swiss federal office for meteorology and climatology for the period 1951 2003 österle et al 2006 wechsung et al 2013 due to lack of available station data in the french part of the rhine basin grid based e obs precipitation data on a 0 25 0 25 grid haylock et al 2008 are used for that area these grid points are added to the pik dataset and treated as stations in total 208 stations are used in the rhine basin the rwg is based on the high resolution gridded hyras dataset provided by the german weather service deutscher wetterdienst 2018 hyras comprises precipitation records at over 4000 stations in central europe covering the period 1951 2006 deutscher wetterdienst 2018 for the interpolation from station data to a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km the regnie method is applied by the german weather service that combines multiple linear regression and inverse distance weighting rauthe et al 2013 2 2 2 comparison of input data to ensure a fair evaluation of the performance of weather generators their input datasets must be comparable the similarity in key statistics of the input datasets is evaluated at the local scale and serves as a basis for the wg comparison we compare the following statistics whereby the closest hyras grid point to each pik station is selected for comparison daily mean precipitation daily extreme precipitation 99 9th percentile wet to dry transition probabilities wet day frequencies these statistics are calculated by taking all daily values separately for each month for the time period 1951 2003 overlapping time period for pik and hyras datasets for instance for a 53 year series consisting of all daily precipitation values in june 53 30 1590 the 99 9th percentile is computed according to the weibull plotting positions makkonen 2006 additionally the mean absolute error mae of daily extreme precipitation between both datasets is evaluated to identify possible patterns of high deviations and their dependence on elevation while daily means and extremes depict precipitation intensity transition probabilities and wet frequencies describe the occurrence of precipitation transition probabilities are a measure for sequence and fragmentation of wet and dry spells with two alternative states wet dry four combinations on two subsequent days are possible wet to dry wet to wet dry to wet and dry to dry the wet to dry transition probability thus represents the probability of a dry day following a wet day the wet day frequency displays the share of wet days recorded during the regarded time period the precipitation threshold for considering a day as wet is set to 0 1 mm these statistics are presented for nine selected pik stations in the rhine catchment see table 1 shown in fig 1 these stations are chosen to represent all parts of the rhine basin and different altitudes 2 3 weather generators in this study we compare two weather generators of different types a multi site latent gaussian auto regressive model hundecha et al 2009 and a nearest neighbour resampling weather generator beersma and buishand 2003 2 3 1 weather generator approaches the awg simulates the precipitation occurrence and amounts at the locations of individual station using a latent gaussian auto regressive model considering spatial covariance structure bardossy and plate 1992 hundecha et al 2009 the distribution of precipitation amount considering dry days at a single station location is described by eq 1 1 h x u 1 p w p w f x u where h x u is the cumulative distribution of the non negative precipitation amount x at location u p w represents the wet frequency conversely 1 p w stands for the probability of zero precipitation and f x is the cumulative distribution of the non zero precipitation amount f x is assumed to be a mixed distribution wherein the bulk of rainfall amount is modeled using the gamma distribution and extremes are represented by the generalized pareto gp distribution the mixture model reads 2 f x u 1 m x u g x u m x u p x u k u where f x u is the probability density function of mixed distribution m x u is the mixing weight given in eq 3 frigessi et al 2002 g x u and p x u are the probability density functions of gamma and gp distributions respectively k u is the normalizing constant given in eq 4 3 m x u 1 2 1 π arctan x υ u τ u where υ u and τ u are the location and steepness parameters 4 k u 1 1 π 0 p x u g x u arctan x υ u τ u dx in total six parameters two for each distribution and two for the mixture model need to be estimated for every month and station the multisite precipitation is modelled using the multivariate autoregressive model 5 w t bw t 1 c ψ t where w t is the multivariate standard normal distribution at time t and w t w t u 1 w t u n with marginal distributions at n locations ψ t ψ t u 1 ψ t u n is a random vector of independent normally distributed random variables with zero mean and unit variance matrices b and c are related to lag 0 and lag 1 correlation matrices m 0 m 1 of w t as follows 6 b m 1 m 0 1 7 cc t m 0 bm 1 t where c t and m 1 t are transposed matrices in practice large correlation matrices in eqs 6 and 7 are usually not well defined and hence need to be corrected therefore an isotropic spatial correlation function is assumed where the correlation only depends on the distance between stations bardossy and plate 1992 hundecha et al 2009 finally eqs 1 and 5 are linked through the following relationship 8 φ w t u h x t u where φ is a cumulative distribution of the standard normal variate for further details on the awg the reader is referred to hundecha et al 2009 the rwg reshuffles the observed daily precipitation fields for the entire domain into a new order to generate synthetic series the spatial correlation of the precipitation fields is thus preserved for each day the auto correlation for the synthetic series is considered by seeking for analogue historical patterns of the previously simulated day beersma and buishand 2003 hegnauer et al 2014 hence the sequence of synthetic fields is generated by sampling the next day from the k nearest subset of neighbours days nearest neighbours are determined by assessing the auto correlation and data similarity of the historical records in the entire domain within a selected time window e g same calendar month beersma and buishand 2003 the new sequence of precipitation values only includes values within the range of historical observations single day extremes going beyond historical records are thus not generated however multi day extreme precipitation can still exceed observed multi day maxima if several reshuffled days with high precipitation follow each other the limitation on single day extremes at the monthly time scale can be relaxed by choosing a wide time window of a few months for selecting the nearest neighbours hegnauer et al 2014 2 3 2 weather generator configuration we condition the awg on the daily precipitation pik station dataset at each station we generate 100 realizations of synthetic daily precipitation series of 53 years length i e the same length as observations for the rwg the gridded hyras precipitation is aggregated to areal precipitation for 134 rhine sub basins in order to simplify and accelerate the generation of synthetic precipitation fields hence a one day precipitation field in rwg is represented by 134 values of mean sub basin precipitation the k nearest neighbour selection and reshuffling algorithms are run on the sub basin scale likewise 100 realization of daily precipitation series of 53 years are produced by the rwg awg and rwg operate on different spatial scales i e station and sub basin scale respectively hence the output needs to be compared at the same spatial scale which is the sub basin scale thus we interpolate the time series of the awg onto a 1 km 1 km raster and aggregate the output to 134 sub basin areal precipitation series for the comparison of simulated areal precipitation with observed records also the historical station records are interpolated and aggregated in the same manner we apply the regnie interpolation method which was also used to generate the hyras dataset used by rwg rauthe et al 2013 regnie method is based on a combination of the multiple linear regression mlr and inverse distance weighting idw mlr is applied to compute monthly background fields of precipitation conditioned on the explanatory variables longitude latitude elevation slope and aspect in the generation of the hyras dataset climate stations are clustered according to their climatological characteristics in producing specific background fields rauthe et al 2013 due to the lower number of stations in the pik dataset cluster analysis is not expected to strongly improve the interpolation results for the rhine basin we therefore omit this step and use all stations in the background field calculation for the generation of daily precipitation fields the observed daily precipitation at each station is divided by the value of the respective background field the resulting ratio is interpolated to grid points without observations using idw with parabolic weights finally daily precipitation at unobserved location is obtained by multiplying the ratio with the respective value of the background field 2 3 3 weather generator performance evaluation given the comparable input data the performance of the two weather generators to reproduce observed weather statistics is assessed at the same time we benchmark two different models and discuss their strengths and weaknesses for both weather generators we compute and evaluate the same statistics as observational datasets additionally annual maximum multi day precipitation sums over 5 10 and 20 days are compared at basin scale the comparison of multi day extremes aims at evaluating flood events caused by prolonged rainfall over consecutive days based on an unbounded extreme value distribution the awg is capable of generating extreme events higher than the observations even on the daily scale extremes exceeding observations in the rwg can only be generated through a sequence of successive high precipitation values multi day maxima multi day maxima are analyzed against their return periods t computed with the weibull plotting positions makkonen 2006 and compared to observed multi day maxima from 53 year long series the overall comparison scheme at various spatial scales is depicted in fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of input datasets this section compares the precipitation intensity and occurrence statistics of the employed input datasets at station locations the daily mean precipitation in both datasets is nearly identical not shown and is not further discussed here fig 3 presents the results for extreme precipitation 99 9th percentile at nine selected stations pik and hyras datasets are in good agreement with each other at low elevations at higher elevations the differences between station based pik and raster based hyras datasets tend to increase for stations ur2 and ar the slightly higher station based precipitation has to be expected due to the smoothed topography in the gridded dataset when average elevation of a raster cell 1 km 1 km is taken grillakis et al 2010 hession and moore 2011 this pattern is visible when comparing the mae of daily extreme precipitation across all stations in fig 4 the highest mae values are found at a few stations in the high elevation alpine region and the french part of the basin we recall that in the french part the coarse gridded e obs precipitation data are integrated into the pik dataset since station records are not available in this region these higher errors can therefore be explained by the lower spatial resolution of the e obs dataset which tends to underestimate the station based records overall both pik and hyras datasets are comparable with regards to the mean and extreme daily precipitation magnitudes fig 5 shows a close agreement of wet to dry transition probabilities between pik and hyras datasets without a systematic bias the deviations are very small and do not depend on the station elevation or location note the small range of the y axis however we observe a small systematic difference in wet day frequencies of 2 to 5 percent points at all station locations fig 6 hyras constantly shows slightly higher wet day frequencies given comparable wet to dry transition probabilities this implies a slightly longer duration of wet spells in the hyras dataset this can partly be explained by the effect that small scale precipitation events may not be captured at some pik stations but may still result in wet raster cells in the interpolated hyras dataset moreover the hyras dataset contains considerably more stations than the pik dataset so the probability of wet cells after interpolation is higher compared to the probability of precipitation occurrence at each individual pik station stations in higher elevations with larger daily precipitation lr2 hr ar tend to display a greater intra annual variability of wet frequencies this is consistent in both datasets in total we consider the datasets very similar as there are only some deviations in daily extreme precipitation at some high elevation locations and a small bias towards higher wet frequency in the hyras dataset these differences can be explained by the difference in the type of the datasets i e station based vs raster based we expect these differences to not significantly affect the performance of the weather generators 3 2 performance of weather generators the synthetic precipitation series from the weather generators are evaluated at different scales first the awg is assessed at the locations of the climate stations by comparing its performance statistics with those of the observed pik dataset since the output of the rwg is only available as daily areal precipitation for 134 sub basins its performance cannot be assessed at station locations hence in the second step awg and rwg are evaluated at the sub basin scale this reveals the ability of both models to simulate areal precipitation and to resemble the spatial correlation structure to this end the awg output is interpolated and aggregated to the sub basin scale as described in section 2 finally multi day extremes are evaluated at the basin scale 3 2 1 awg performance at station locations daily mean precipitation is very well captured by the awg not shown which can be expected for a state of the art stochastic precipitation model similarly the daily extreme precipitation 99 9th percentile is well reproduced and lies within the range of simulated values at all stations in all months fig 7 there is little bias between simulated and observed extreme precipitation for some stations and months e g in december at ur2 in march at lr2 or in may at hr very large values of extreme precipitation are generated on one side these large values may underline the ability of the awg to generate extremes that have never been observed on the other side a high uncertainty remains concerning these extremes due to the limited data length and hence limited comparability of the observational time period the question of how realistic these extremes are cannot be answered with certainty model structure errors and parameter uncertainty can also lead to overshooting and generation of outliers we detect a systematic bias of the awg towards an overestimation of the wet to dry transition probabilities fig 8 the overestimation is more pronounced in higher elevations in contrast the awg almost perfectly represents the observed wet day frequencies in all seasons at all nine stations fig 9 hence we conclude that the number of wet days is well reproduced but the wet spells are more fragmented i e separated by dry spells in the synthetic time series this discrepancy should not affect single day extremes but may lead to an underestimation of multi day extreme precipitation overall the at site performance of the awg can be regarded as very good despite slight problems in capturing precipitation intermittency which is not expected to significantly affect flood hazard 3 2 2 performance of the weather generators at the sub basin and basin scale overall daily mean precipitation is well captured by awg and rwg though awg tends to underestimate observed areal precipitation at some sub basins throughout the year not shown the comparison of the 99 9th percentiles of sub basin precipitation for both weather generators and corresponding observations fig 10 reveals a contrasting picture to the station based evaluation the awg tends to overestimate the observed areal precipitation particularly visible for sub basins bodensee lowrhine4 and main7 whereas for the rwg no systematic overestimation is detected also the range of awg simulated precipitation is often larger than that of the rwg whereas the latter can be expected due to the unconstrained distribution functions used in the awg the clear overestimation of observed areal extremes is of concern taking into account the satisfactory performance of the awg at individual stations we explain the overestimation of the areal precipitation by an overestimation of the spatial correlation particularly for extreme events this has also been reported for other weather generators which use an isotropic correlation function serinaldi and kilsby 2014 the spatial correlation is parametrized using the entire observed precipitation dataset however extreme precipitation tends to have shorter correlation distances than the bulk of precipitation mueller and haberlandt 2015 applying an isotropic correlation function results in more extremes occurring simultaneously at multiple sites this consequently leads to higher areal precipitation simulated by the awg the overestimation of areal precipitation by the awg is particularly pronounced during the summer months we explain this by the dominance of convective storms on extreme rainfall during that season in the observations these extremes are localized whereas in the awg synthetic data they become much more extended the overestimation is detected in the lowland sub basins as well as in high elevations a comparison between observed areal precipitation in the interpolated pik and hyras datasets reveals higher values in the hyras in all sub basins throughout almost all months this finding can be ascribed to the effect of interpolation and the higher station density in the hyras dataset accordingly the difference between the simulated areal precipitation generated by the awg and rwg varies across sub basins some sub basins show predominantly higher values in the rwg results kleine emme lowrhine4 umos1 others exhibit the opposite lahn4 bodensee this observation reflects the different extents to which the aspects discussed above impact the weather generation across sub basins the benchmarking of the weather generator performance at the sub basin scale reveals a weakness of the awg in correctly representing the spatial correlation structure for different event magnitudes the awg systematically overestimates observed areal precipitation however due to higher observed areal precipitation in the hyras dataset due to a denser observation network the rwg synthetic extreme precipitation is comparable to that generated by the awg hence the overestimation of the correlation structure in the awg is partly compensated for during the interpolation and sub basin aggregation steps compared to the rwg approach the wet to dry transition probabilities at the sub basin scale are slightly higher for the hyras dataset compared to the interpolated pik data fig 11 meaning that the wet spells in the hyras observations are more fragmented both weather generators tend to overshoot the wet to dry transition probabilities in the synthetically generated series the overestimation of the awg is however more pronounced which is consistent with the overestimation at the locations of the individual stations we do not detect any significant seasonal variation in the bias in wet frequencies and transition probabilities the observed wet frequencies in the interpolated and aggregated pik dataset are somewhat higher than those in hyras for all analyzed sub basins fig 12 whereas at the locations of the individual stations the wet frequencies are very similar fig 6 the difference emerges at the sub basin scale and is likely introduced during the interpolation procedure and lower station density in the pik dataset this assumption is confirmed when comparing both observations at a threshold for wet days of 1 mm day not shown where discrepancies almost completely disappear with a slightly higher threshold less contributing stations need to record precipitation to count as wet which balances the lower station density of pik the rwg captures the observed wet frequencies of the respective observational dataset well at the sub basin scale while the awg slightly overshoots them despite the good performance at the station locations apparently overestimated correlation of high precipitation leads to a simultaneous occurrence of precipitation at multiple locations and consequently to high fractions of wet days when aggregated to the sub basin scale higher frequency of wet days may contribute to longer wet spells but also to higher wet to dry transition probabilities the latter could partially explain the stronger deviations of wet to dry transition probabilities between pik and awg fig 11 at the scale of the entire rhine basin the multi day maximum precipitation frequencies for sums over 5 10 and 20 days are strongly overestimated by the awg approach fig 13 compared to the observations therein awg seems to stronger overshoot the observed maximum precipitation for the 5 day aggregation compared to 10 and 20 days likely individual spatially extended extreme precipitation events which are overestimated by the awg have stronger weight in the 5 day precipitation sum compared to the other two aggregation periods rwg captures the observations generally well it is capable of producing slightly higher multi day precipitation sums than the observations towards larger return periods however rwg has a slight tendency to underestimate the observations for the precipitation sums of 10 and 20 subsequent days hegnauer et al 2014 point out to the underestimated auto correlation of daily precipitation by the rwg this temporal dependence affects extreme rainfall intensities strongly and would require the implementation of a long memory term to be fully reproduced notably the multi day maximum precipitation frequencies of both observational datasets pik and hyras are nearly the same when aggregated to the entire rhine basin it is likely that the larger wet day frequencies and lower fragmentation of wet spells in the interpolated pik dataset contribute to balance its generally lower precipitation intensities fig 10 when aggregated to multi day sums with increasing return period the deviation between rwg and awg results increases we explain this by the overestimation of the areal extreme precipitation by the awg which becomes more pronounced for lower probabilities also the underestimation by the rwg contributes to the discrepancy overall the awg model performs very well at the individual locations but exhibits problems in correctly representing the spatial correlation structure of extreme precipitation particularly in the summer months this leads to a considerable overestimation of the areal statistics such as wet frequencies and extreme precipitation at the sub basin scale and multi day extremes for the entire rhine basin other weather generators of the time series type show a similar weakness serinaldi and kilsby 2014 we attribute this to the use of an average isotropic correlation function applied to generate both low magnitude and extreme events extreme rainfalls are often produced by local convective storms and have rather short correlation distances low magnitude precipitation events have larger spatial footprints and correlation distances mueller and haberlandt 2015 this behaviour explains the stronger overestimation of the areal precipitation in summer when the convective storms typically occur we recommend an adjustment of the spatial correlation structure simulated by the awg for bulk and extreme precipitation two different functions can be used below and above a certain threshold which should be tested in future research the rwg has an advantage to implicitly retain the spatial correlation of precipitation by reshuffling observed precipitation fields rwg performs well in all statistics at the sub basin scale only wet to dry transition probabilities are slightly overestimated which hints to higher fragmentation of wet spells than in the observed hyras dataset following the findings of e g apipattanavis et al 2007 or kleiber et al 2012 an implementation of a three state first order markov chain prior to the resampling weather generation may improve the reproduction of wet and dry spells the overshooting is however by far smaller than for the awg the slight underestimation of multi day precipitation extremes may be overcome by including a memory element in the weather generation however this temporal correlation might then lead to weaker reproductions of the other precipitation statistics which are not so strongly affected by it hegnauer et al 2014 the variability of generated extreme precipitation at the sub basin scale is much smaller for the rwg compared to the awg the main aim of the weather generators is to capture the natural variability of precipitation which is unknown and can only be approximately sensed by very long instrumental records in a stationary climate neither is the climate stationary nor are instrumental records available over large areas for long periods thus it remains difficult to estimate what the true range of natural variability in precipitation series is and which weather generator approach is better able to represent the reality the rwg is limited to generate daily extremes beyond the maximum observed record in the past but was shown to generate multi day extremes exceeding the observed maxima though the awg is capable of generating extremes at different time scales exceeding the observed records by far due to the unlimited nature of the underlying distributions the areal extremes may be unrealistic due to an overestimation of the spatial correlation the awg tends to produce more precipitation simultaneously at multiple sites to sense the physical limits for maximum precipitation estimation of probable maximum precipitation either using statistical approaches hershfield 1961 hershfield 1965 douglas and barros 2003 or physically based climate modeling ohara et al 2011 ishida et al 2015 chen et al 2017 should be further explored this could set another benchmark for evaluating weather generators and their ability to capture the natural variability of precipitation 4 conclusions in this study we assess and benchmark the performance of a multi site auto regressive weather generator awg and a raster based resampling weather generator rwg in estimating spatially consistent rainfall fields and their temporal variability in the rhine catchment awg and rwg are conditioned on a station based dataset pik and a raster based dataset hyras respectively the datasets are found comparable at the locations of individual stations but differences in wet day probabilities wet to dry transition probabilities and extreme precipitation magnitudes are revealed when the pik dataset is interpolated and aggregated to the sub basin scale we explain this by the different station density and deviations in the implementation of the interpolation procedure e g different dems the station based awg excels in producing daily precipitation statistics at the local scale but overestimates the spatial correlation of extremes as a consequence the estimates of single day and multi day extremes overshoot the observed values a better estimation of spatial correlations for extreme rainfall is required for the awg to realistically estimate flood risk the rwg captures the observed single and multi day extreme precipitation magnitudes well with a slight underestimation of generated multi day extremes its ranges are found to show lower variability than those from awg generated series however how well both models reproduce the range of natural variability remains open and further research is recommended to integrate probable maximum precipitation into the evaluation of weather generators declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

4267,flocculation is an important dynamic process for fine sediment transport a number of physical and biochemical factors affecting flocculation have been identified but quantitative examination of floc structure and fractal property under varying physical conditions is still needed in this contribution we conducted lab experiments using an annular flume and natural sediment to evaluate changes in floc size distributions and fractal dimensions under varying turbulent shear g salinity and suspended sediment concentration ssc the low intrusive optical instrument of labsfloc 2 was deployed to capture images of flocs which enables calculation of floc sizes and settling velocities observations showed that the mean floc size in freshwater first increased with increasing g below a threshold of g 40 s 1 followed by a decrease with further increases in shear the shear threshold was smaller for saline water salinity of 7 psu i e g 20 30 s 1 than that in freshwater the fractal dimension of flocs decreased with an increase in size suggesting more fragile structure for macro flocs turbulent shear appeared to play a dominant role in controlling floc structure flocs formed under large shear force were more compacted and had larger fractal dimensions the floc fractal dimension was 28 37 greater in freshwater than in saline water an improved method considering both floc size and variable fractal dimension is proposed for better simulation of floc effective density the improved understanding of flocculation dynamics and floc structure in this work have implications for fine sediment

flocculation plays a crucial role in controlling cohesive sediment mass settling fluxes particularly considering that the majority of cohesive suspended sediments are transported in the form of flocs in varying water environments from rivers to estuaries manning et al 2006 guo and he 2011 soulsby et al 2013 fettweis et al 2014 mehta et al 2014 meanwhile contaminants and nutrients are typically adsorbed to cohesive sediment thus flocculation affects the transport and flux of contaminants and nutrients and water quality pardo et al 2015 ye et al 2020 better understanding of flocculation processes and floc properties is highly desirable in modeling e g winterwerp et al 2006 sheremet et al 2017 and predicting the behaviors of cohesive sediment and adherent contaminants and nutrients one apparent consequence of flocculation is a relative increase in settling velocity compared with the constituent primary particles the settling velocity of flocs is influenced by the floc size and floc internal structure the aggregation and break up processes of flocs are closely related to the physiochemical and biological environment including primary particle properties e g size and mineral composition hydrodynamics suspended sediment concentration ssc salinity and organic matter gibbs 1983 van leussen 1994 winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 mietta et al 2009 droppo et al 2015 lee et al 2017 turbulent shearing is one of the most important factors affecting the cohesive sediment flocculation processes dyer 1989 winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 on the one hand turbulence promotes the aggregation and development of flocs by accelerating particle collisions on the other hand when it is too large the shearing force may exceed the cohesion between particles resulting in the breakage of flocs dyer and manning 1999 it has been found in previous work that the size of the flocs is mainly controlled by the turbulent kolmogorov microscale η coufort et al 2005 mietta et al 2009 kumar et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 most studies have focused on the effects of these factors on the development of floc size however the understanding of floc structure under various environmental conditions is insufficient sterling et al 2004 kumar et al 2010 ren et al 2017 the floc structure has effects on physical properties such as porosity dewatering density and drag force acting on the floc which makes it a key factor in determining floc settling velocity logan and kilps 1995 previous studies have demonstrated that flocculation kinetics during aggregation and breakup processes are strongly affected by floc structure jiang and logan 1991 maggi 2007 direct measurements of floc structures have been attempted but it is technically challenging and usually only a limited number of individual flocs have been examined e g spencer et al 2010 wheatland et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 being different from primary particles or non cohesive sediment the floc structures are often treated as fractal entities and mathematically quantified by fractal dimension kranenburg 1994 chung and lee 2003 the underlying concept of the fractal dimension is self similarity and it was first formally introduced in cohesive sediment research by kranenburg 1994 though tambo and watanabe 1979 had suggested a similar approach earlier three kinds of fractal dimensions are documented i e one two and three dimensional values indicating linear planar and volumetric properties respectively for example the two dimensional fractal dimension is also known as perimeter based fractal dimension n p which is estimated by the projected area and floc perimeter describing the expansion of area as the perimeter increases spicer and pratsinis 1996 he et al 2012 ren et al 2017 three dimensional fractal dimension n f is the most representative and practical indicator because it describes the space filling ability of actual flocs and could be applied directly in modeling flocs hydrodynamic characteristics and settling velocities winterwerp 1998 khelifa and hill 2006 maggi 2007 unfortunately a direct measure of floc n f without altering fragile floc structure is needed to reconstruct three dimensional structure which is practically challenging chu and lee 2004 a few indirect methods have been suggested to obtain floc n f including estimates based on the perimeter based fractal dimension floc effective density and settling velocity kranenburg 1994 maggi and winterwerp 2004 kumar et al 2010 theoretically the floc s three dimensional fractal dimension n f ranges from 1 to 3 the smaller the n f the looser the floc structure and the more easily it can be destroyed in contrast the larger the n f the denser the structure and the higher the stability a large number of field observations and laboratory test results have shown that the range of n f is mainly between 1 4 and 2 6 jiang and logan 1991 kranenburg 1994 khelifa and hill 2006 verney et al 2009 wang et al 2011 manning and schoellhamer 2013 winterwerp 1998 recommended using a constant value of 2 as a representative n f in estimation of floc settling velocity however several other studies have noticed that n f was highly variable during floc aggregation and break up processes chakraborti et al 2003 maggi 2007 vahedi and gorczyca 2012 moruzzi et al 2017 the fractal dimension of flocs was found to vary with shear rate floc size organic matter and the restructuring processes etc van leussen 1994 stone and krishnappan 2003 sterling et al 2004 showed that the fractal dimension of flocs increased with rising turbulent shear rates it was demonstrated that aggregation mechanisms such as particle cluster aggregation and cluster cluster aggregation have significant effects on floc fractal dimension logan 1999 vahedi and gorczyca 2011 jiang and logan 1991 found that the flocs formed due to differential settling were relatively smaller in fractal dimension in a range of 1 6 2 3 compared with those formed under turbulent shearing n f greater than 2 4 however chen and eisma 1995 reported no correlation between floc fractal dimension and the governing processes of flocculation meanwhile many researchers have suggested that floc fractal dimensions change with the floc size for example risović and martinis 1996 found that as the floc sizes increased from 2 μm to 200 μm their fractal dimensions decreased from about 2 5 to 1 7 the n f was 3 for primary particles and decreased with increasing floc size in a power law function khelifa and hill 2006 maggi 2007 kumar et al 2010 guo et al 2018 two stages of negative linear correlations between fractal dimension and floc size were reported in vahedi and gorczyca 2011 as the result of two mechanisms involved in the floc formation overall it remains an open question how environmental conditions flocculation processes and floc sizes may affect floc structures and floc fractal dimensions to improve understanding of the controls on floc structure and fractal dimensions a series of controlled laboratory experiments were conducted with measurements of floc size and settling velocity under various levels of turbulent shearing salinity and sediment concentration the objective was to further explore how floc fractal dimension evolved in response to varying environmental conditions which would improve the understanding and prediction in the transport of cohesive sediment and associated contaminants and nutrients 2 laboratory experiments 2 1 apparatus and materials laboratory experiments of this study were conducted in an annular flume in the brunel laboratory plymouth university uk the annular flume has an outer diameter of 120 cm a channel width of 10 cm and a depth of 15 cm along with a detachable roof the annular flume is a research proven tool which is able to obtain fully developed open flow conditions as a result of the infinite flow length and can be used to create repeatable and consistent turbulent environment stone and krishnappan 2003 floc properties were obtained by the labsfloc 2 laboratory spectral flocculation characteristics version 2 instrument which utilized a low intrusive high resolution video camera to observe flocs as they settled in a perspex settling column manning et al 2007 2010 floc sizes and settling velocities can be obtained simultaneously by the labsfloc 2 which has a distinct advantage over laser particle instruments like lisst laser in situ scattering and transmissiometry the labsfloc 2 camera resolution can practically resolve flocs from 10 μm to 8 mm in size settling velocities generally ranging from 0 01 mm s 1 to 45 mm s 1 can be measured by labsfloc 2 the annular flume and similar camera system have been successfully utilized in a few works e g manning and dyer 1999 gratiot and manning 2004 manning et al 2010 the sediment used in the experiments were collected from the surface bed in the turbidity maximum zone tmz of the yangtze estuary ye china which is a river tide controlled highly turbid and muddy estuary fig 1 a the water depth of the sampling site the middle segment of the north passage the core region of the tmz was approximately 13 m below mean water level tidal waves mainly have a range of 2 4 m and tidal currents are asymmetrical with stronger peak ebb currents than flood current velocities sediment samples were collected during neap tide with the peak ebb and flood current velocities of 1 4 m s 1 and 0 9 m s 1 respectively turbulent shear rate near the bottom layer varied mainly in the range of about 3 30 s 1 during the whole tidal cycle guo et al 2017 salinity was lower than 2 psu most of the time during the sampling and the maximum salinity was about 11 psu the mean ssc was about 0 24 g l 1 and the bottom ssc was 1 73 g l 1 during the neap tide sampling however the maximum bottom ssc could reach 10 g l 1 at spring tides inducing strong siltation and maintenance dredging demand in the navigational waterway guo et al 2017 lin et al 2021 the primary particle size distributions of the sediment samples were analyzed using a mastersizer 2000 measuring range 0 02 2000 μm reproducibility error 3 after h2o2 and sodium metaphosphate treatment and 15 min of sonification these chemical and physical treatments were expected to remove organic matter and break all the aggregated particles into primary ones results showed that the median diameter of the sediment particles was 11 7 μm specifically the sediment has a content of 17 clay 4 μm 72 silt 4 62 μm 8 very fine sand 62 5 125 μm and 3 fine and medium sand 125 500 μm fig 1b organic matter content of the sediment was about 3 1 which was determined through mass loss in ignition at 450 c for 6 h 2 2 experimental processes the laboratory experiments included 18 runs with 6 runs in freshwater a1 a6 with ssc of 150 mg l 1 and 12 in saline water with salinity of 7 0 5 psu b1 b6 and c1 c6 under sscs of 150 mg l 1 and 350 mg l 1 respectively tap water was used in the experiments as fresh water and cooking salt was added to create saline water experiments the water temperature was around 20 during all experiments ssc of 150 mg l 1 was implemented in both fresh and saline water experiments and a higher ssc of 350 mg l 1 c1 c6 was additionally considered in the saltwater environment for each concentration six increments of turbulent shear rate ranging from 10 s 1 to 65 s 1 at the sampling height were created in the flume to shear the sediment slurries the conditions and environmental variables in the laboratory experiments were selected from within the ranges experienced in the field at the sampling site and a summary of the experimental conditions can be found in table 1 experiments started from the highest shear rate and decreased step by step towards the lowest one as the runs progressed in each run sediment mixtures were sheared under the same turbulence for 30 min then halting the flume motor and sampling two volumes using a modified pipette with internal diameter of 6 mm the sampling was made at a height 20 mm from the flume bed one sample was used to determine the ssc by the method of filtration and drying and the other one was transferred immediately to the labsfloc 2 settling column in order to minimize any aggregation or break up the results of ssc analysis showed that variations of ssc under different turbulent shear for a given run was within 20 suggesting that ssc was relatively stable during the experiments the aperture of the pipette was brought into contact with the settling column water surface allowing flocs in the pipette to settle by gravitation fig 2 to reduce the effects of density contrast the settling column was filled with water of the same temperature and salinity as the annular flume fluid this floc sub sampling method is a proven sampling technique see gratiot and manning 2004 mietta et al 2009 manning et al 2010 kumar et al 2010 2 3 data analysis floc images were recorded in real time as a series of avi format files at an acquisition rate of 7 5 frames per second a total of 5963 flocs were measured in 18 experiments these files were then converted into consecutive images using a matlab frame grabbing routine the hr wallingford ltd digifloc software manning et al 2017 was then used to semi automatically process images to obtain floc size and settling velocity spectra by measuring both major dx and minor dy axis of the closest ellipse inscribing the floc a spherically equivalent floc diameter d could be determined from 2 1 d d x d y as the time step between two frames one frame 0 133 s is known settling velocity ws can be calculated by measuring the vertical distance a floc travels between two frames then a modified version of stokes law was used to estimate floc effective density by 2 2 ρ e 18 μ w s d 2 g where g is the gravitational acceleration and μ is the dynamic molecular viscosity when flocs exhibited high particle reynolds numbers e g re w s d ν 0 5 where ν is kinematic viscosity indicating flocs fell beyond the viscous reynolds region the oseen modification was applied to account for the inertial drag during floc settling hill et al 1998 manning and dyer 2002 2 3 ρ eoseen 18 μ w s d 2 g 1 3 c 16 r e where c is a constant of 0 43 hill et al 1998 floc fractal dimension n f was estimated using kranenburg 1994 2 4 ρ e ρ p ρ w d d n f 3 in which ρ w is water density at 20 1000 kg m 3 for freshwater and 1006 kg m 3 for 7 psu saltwater and d is the median diameter of the primary particle d50 ρ p is primary particle density which is estimated to be 2570 kg m 3 given an organic matter mass ratio of 3 and a density of 1300 kg m 3 for organic matter and a density of 2600 kg m 3 for the mineral fraction 3 results results showed that the floc size d ranged between 20 μm and 413 μm 45 7 of which were over 120 μm the ws varied from 0 2 mm s 1 to 10 0 mm s 1 with the median ws of 1 2 mm s 1 the estimated minimum and maximum floc effective densities ρ e were 3 6 kg m 3 and 1691 kg m 3 respectively 3 1 freshwater flocculation in the freshwater experiments a total of 991 particles were observed floc size d ranged between 27 μm and 260 μm whilst floc settling velocity ws varied from 0 2 mm s 1 to 7 8 mm s 1 fig 3 a 3c illustrate the distributions of d and ws for samples under the highest a1 g 65 s 1 moderate a3 g 40 s 1 and lowest a6 g 10 s 1 shear rates respectively for the same floc size the settling velocities varied in a considerable range and vice versa the median d of each run varied between 38 μm and 66 μm which was 3 6 times of the median size of primary particle d50 11 7 μm the maximum and minimum floc sizes were detected at g 40 s 1 a3 and g 10 s 1 a6 respectively the median ws changed between 0 3 mm s 1 and 1 4 mm s 1 and it decreased with a decline in g the diagonal lines in fig 3a 3c represent contours of floc ρ e calculated by stokes s law indicating that the effective densities of flocs formed in freshwater were mainly in the range of 160 1600 kg m 3 the floc effective density in a1 was the largest overall with about 18 3 exceeding 1300 kg m 3 and with a median ρ e of 950 kg m 3 the median ρ e of all particles obtained in fresh water experiments was around 780 kg m 3 to aid the interpretation of the floc characteristics each floc population was divided into ten size bands sbs from 40 μm to greater than 360 μm at an interval of 40 μm considering the observed floc size ranges the sb distributions of floc number and mean floc ws at a1 a3 and a6 are shown in fig 3d 3f cases a1 and a3 covered seven sbs from 40 μm to 280 μm and the majority of flocs concentrated in the sb of 40 80 μm floc sizes in case a6 spanned a relatively narrow range which contained only the smallest two sbs with 60 of flocs 40 μm in size the mean ws at different sbs in a1 first increased from 0 7 mm s 1 sb1 to 2 4 mm s 1 sb4 then decreased gradually with the increase in d variations of mean ws in a3 were similar to that of a1 except for the sharp rise from sb6 to sb7 at the lowest shear rate case of a6 floc mean ws increased from 0 3 mm s 1 sb1 to 0 4 mm s 1 sb2 3 2 saltwater flocculation there were 12 floc populations obtained in the 7 psu saltwater experiments including 4972 observed flocs in total in the cases of b1 b6 floc size d changed between 25 μm and 330 μm and ws ranged from 0 2 mm s 1 to 7 0 mm s 1 some specific results under the ssc of 150 mg l 1 are presented in fig 4 as g decreased from 65 s 1 to 10 s 1 the median d in the experimental runs b1 b3 and b6 were 97 μm 130 μm and 107 μm respectively with the peak value under g 40 s 1 whilst the maximum and minimum floc mean ws occurred under the largest and smallest turbulent shear rates respectively when g 65 s 1 about 83 of the floc ρ e exceeded 160 kg m 3 and as g decreased floc ρ e showed a decreasing tendency more than 60 of floc ρ e was in the range of 16 160 kg m 3 under the shear rate of 10 s 1 compared with the results in freshwater the floc sizes under a salinity of 7 psu were distributed over a wider size range 25 330 μm in saline water as opposed to 27 260 μm in freshwater the highest shear case b1 had the smallest size range including six sbs 40 280 μm the majority of flocs were concentrated in sb of 80 120 μm under both shear rates of 65 s 1 and 10 s 1 however it shifted to a larger sb of 120 160 μm when g 40 s 1 the largest floc mean ws of about 4 0 mm s 1 appeared in the sb of 120 160 μm in b1 case under the highest shear whilst the smallest mean ws occurred in the 40 μm sb in b3 under the lowest shear which was only 0 3 mm s 1 in the cases with ssc of 350 mg l 1 floc size d changed from 20 μm to 420 μm and the floc ws varied in 0 2 10 0 mm s 1 fig 5 demonstrates the specific results under the shear rates of 65 s 1 40 s 1 and 10 s 1 with the decreasing turbulent shear rate the median d increased first and then decreased the largest median floc d of 130 μm was observed at g 40 s 1 median floc ws declined gradually from around 3 3 mm s 1 down to 0 7 mm s 1 with decreasing g as for the changes of floc effective density when the shear rate was large g 65 s 1 ρ e was mainly in the range of 160 1600 kg m 3 however floc ρ e was relatively lower at g 10 s 1 mainly in the range of 16 160 kg m 3 the sb with the largest proportion of flocs was similar to the results under the ssc of 150 mg l 1 concentrating in the ranges of 80 120 μm and 120 160 μm the floc mean ws was found to first increase and then decrease with the increase of floc sb and the largest value of approximately 6 0 mm s 1 occurred in the sb of 200 240 μm the smallest floc mean ws appeared in the 40 80 μm sb at c6 which was about 0 6 mm s 1 3 3 impact of physical conditions on floc size development 3 3 1 turbulent shear variation of floc size distribution with g under different salinities and sscs in this study is shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the median floc size obtained in each group of experiments was significantly larger than the median primary sediment size d50 11 7 μm indicating that flocculation occurred in all the experimental cases in freshwater and saltwater under varied g and ssc but there was a difference in the degree of flocculation flocs in freshwater conditions were notably smaller than the turbulent kolmogorov micro scale η as the increase of g η decreases floc size showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with the largest value found in the medium shear rate of g 40 s 1 it suggests that in the freshwater experiment when g 40 s 1 the increase of turbulence promoted the development of flocs while when g exceeded a critical value of 40 s 1 flow turbulence played a dominant role in floc break up leading to a decrease in floc size with further increase in turbulence shear in saltwater conditions the largest floc size and η were on the same order of magnitude and they were positively correlated although some floc sizes exceeded η which was consistent with previous studies in that turbulent shear rate was crucial in controlling the maximum floc size median floc sizes were all smaller than η and the peak median floc sizes appeared at g 20 30 s 1 showing that the overall median floc sizes in 7 psu saltwater also tended to increase first and then decrease as g increased 3 4 salinity and ssc according to the results in freshwater and saltwater under the same ssc 150 mg l 1 flocs formed under a 7 psu salinity were significantly larger the median floc size in salt water was approximately 2 4 times of that in freshwater under the same turbulent shear rate this difference indicates that the presence of salinity could promote floc development by modifying the electrochemical properties of the sediment surface for the natural mixed sediment flocs developed in a higher ssc of 350 mg l 1 were greater in size than those in 150 mg l 1 in saltwater indicating that increasing ssc would enhance floc growth due to accelerating particle collision frequencies van der lee 2000 verney et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 note that the variations of floc size with ssc was less noticeable than those with salinity 4 discussion 4 1 controls and impacts of floc fractal property a constant value of 2 was advocated by winterwerp 1998 as the representation of floc fractal dimension in the simulation of floc settling velocity in estuaries nevertheless many researchers suggested a variable fractal dimension to better define floc structure maggi 2007 kumar et al 2010 guo et al 2018 in this study the mean n f calculated by formula 2 4 of flocs in freshwater case a ssc 150 mg l 1 and 7 psu saltwater case b ssc 150 mg l 1 case c ssc 350 mg l 1 experiments were 2 46 2 06 and 2 09 respectively fig 7 flocs formed in the freshwater environment were overall more compacted with a higher n f although the mean n f of 2 08 in saltwater was similar to that suggested by winterwerp 1998 a non constant and widely distributed n f was observed in the experiments n f showed a decreasing trend with the increase of floc size and a power law was proposed with r 0 55 n 5963 for all points the mean n f decreased by about 31 from 2 38 0 38 for flocs between 20 and 100 μm down to 1 65 0 20 for flocs larger than 300 μm table 2 these trends confirm the earlier studies that as flocs grew in size the floc structure changed too khelifa and hill 2006 maggi 2007 the decrease in floc fractal dimension with the increase of floc size could be explained by the increase of primary particles number and the increase of the possible internal arrangements within the flocs as well as factors such as floc breakup and restructuring of internal particles maggi 2007 vahedi and gorczyca 2012 as floc sizes grow their porosities increase and can even exceed 90 and due to the incorporation of increasing water content within flocs floc effective densities tend to decline along with increased fragility in floc structure and lower fractal dimension de boer et al 2000 manning et al 2007 fig 8 presents the change of mean n f with turbulent shear rate under different salinities and sscs from the experiments n f showed an overall increasing trend with the rising of g and the mean n f under freshwater and salinity of 7 psu increased by approximately 37 and 28 from around 1 89 and 1 88 at g 10 s 1 to about 2 58 and 2 41 at g 65 s 1 respectively as the larger the fractal dimension the more stable and denser are the flocs winterwerp 1998 verney et al 2009 floc effective density and settling velocity would be greater if the fractal dimension was larger for the same size this could explain why the peak median floc size occurred at moderate g while the median floc settling velocity increased with g see figs 3 5 it also suggests that the effects of floc structure and its effective density on the floc settling velocity may be more significant than that of the floc size the fractal dimension of flocs obtained in the experiments using natural mixed sediment increased with the increase of turbulent shear rate which was similar to the experimental results of sterling et al 2004 using clay particles they found that floc fractal dimension increased from approximately 1 9 to 2 3 as g increased from 5 s 1 to 50 s 1 in an environment of strong turbulence loosely structured flocs are likely to break up under the shearing force and a restructuring and reformation of primary particles or small flocs occur which would lead to the more compact flocs spicer and pratsinis 1996 vahedi and gorczyca 2012 thus the structure of the remaining flocs will be relatively stronger with large fractal dimension and difficult to be destroyed in contrast lower density flocs exhibiting a high porosity structural matrix are more likely to survive in the environment of weak turbulence resulting in an overall smaller floc fractal dimension chakraborti et al 2003 therefore there will be large differences in the structure of flocs formed in different hydrodynamic environments even for flocs with the same size flocs formed under weak turbulence are relatively loose and the floc fractal dimension and effective density are usually small while the flocs formed under strong shearing force are more compact with larger floc fractal dimension and effective density regarding the effects of salinity on the fractal dimension of floc kumar et al 2010 found that n f was mainly between 2 1 and 2 5 in freshwater which was higher than that in saltwater conditions i e 1 9 2 1 in 10 psu salinity and 1 9 2 2 in 15 psu salinity results in this study showed that floc n f in freshwater cases ranged from 1 9 to 2 6 which was also greater than 1 8 2 3 in 7 psu saltwater environment particularly under moderate to strong turbulence g 30 65 s 1 under the same salinity and g with the increase of ssc from 150 mg l 1 to 350 mg l 1 the changes of n f were small and inconsistent and no significant difference was found when g 10 20 s 1 the mean n f was larger in lower ssc however it became the reverse when g was at 30 65 s 1 note that the effects of high sediment concentration on floc structure may be significant such as when the ssc exceeds 3 4 g l 1 a network structure between flocs may form and result in a hindered settling winterwerp 2002 in this work it is clear that we should not only take into consideration the dynamics of floc size but also pay special attention to the variability of floc fractal dimension in understanding the flocculation processes under varied environments 4 2 improved estimation of floc settling velocity the settling velocity of non cohesive sediment mainly relies on the particle size as the particle density usually remains constant however the simulation of floc settling velocity is much more complicated since the floc effective density is highly variable due to the modification of floc structure during the floc aggregation and break up processes a few methods have been proposed to simulate the variation of floc effective density for example kranenburg 1994 suggested that ρ e ρ p ρ w d d n f 3 based on the self similar fractal theory and floc fractal dimension n f was set as a fixed value usually n f 2 for a certain simulation a quasi self similar concept that n f changed with floc size was proposed by khelifa and hill 2006 and the work of maggi 2007 and kumar et al 2010 also confirmed the variation of floc fractal dimension with size the khelifa and hill 2006 method showed that n f equals 3 for primary particles and then decreases with floc size in a power law function n f 3 d d β β l o g f c 3 l o g d fc d where dfc is a characteristic floc size and fc is the corresponding fractal dimension when floc size increases to dfc fig 9 demonstrates the correlations between floc effective densities and floc sizes from the freshwater experiments under varying turbulent shear it shows an overall decrease of effective density as floc size increased with r 0 74 0 82 and 0 85 for the relative high g 50 s 1 and 65 s 1 fig 10 a moderate g 30 s 1 and 40 s 1 fig 10b and low g 10 s 1 and 20 s 1 fig 9c turbulent shear rates respectively we found that the best fit of khelifa and hill 2006 method had different fc under varying turbulences in the simulation of the change of floc effective density with size it maybe because the characteristic floc fractal dimension fc was closely related to the flocculation environments in particular the flow turbulent shear rate see fig 8 although the best fit of khelifa and hill 2006 method with fc 2 for all the data points was acceptable the scattering of data points was still wide which could lead to large errors in the estimation of floc settling velocity in order to reduce the scatter we proposed an improved khelifa and hill 2006 method with variable fc as f c n ft e kg where n ft was the characteristic floc fractal dimension fc in still water g 0 k was a constant parameter according to the freshwater experimental results n ft was 1 13 and k was 0 012 to quantify the behavior of different simulation methods the root mean square error rmse of simulation results by the kranenburg 1994 method the khelifa and hill 2006 method and the improved method were calculated results showed that rmse of the improved method was the smallest one which was about 48 and 19 smaller than that of the kranenburg 1994 method with n f 2 and the khelifa and hill 2006 method with fc 2 respectively as for the cases of saltwater experiments the improved method with n ft 1 45 and k 0 006 was also found to be the best behaved simulation method rmse of the improved method was about 25 and 14 smaller than that of the kranenburg 1994 method with n f 2 and the khelifa and hill 2006 method with fc 1 9 respectively fig 10 these results suggest that by including the dynamic floc fractal dimension under varied turbulence the improved khelifa and hill 2006 method proposed in this study is more effective in the simulation of variation of the floc effective density with floc size compared to the kranenburg 1994 method and the original khelifa and hill 2006 method note that organic matter content of the sediment was about 3 and it has been demonstrated that organic matter types and contents may have significant influences on floc fractal and effective density mietta et al 2009 fettweis and baeye 2015 lee et al 2017 therefore the use of the proposed improved method under the effects of varied organic matter properties requires further investigation 4 3 implications for flocculation in natural environment training works in the north passage of the ye where the sediments were collected and used in the laboratory experiments have suffered from severe siltation resulting in considerable dredging requirements 60 90 million m3 every year and cost song and wang 2013 it was demonstrated that flocculation and enhanced settling of fine sediment was ascribed to play an important role in the positive feedback loop of vertical mixing and settling which leads to the regime shift in estuaries and siltation within the navigational channel guo et al 2017 lin et al 2021 meanwhile the accurate determination of floc settling velocity has been regarded as a top priority in improving modelling sediment transportation according to the experimental results in this study floc settling velocities were highly variable in the range of 0 2 10 0 mm s 1 the median ws was 1 2 mm s 1 under different environmental conditions floc size is usually taken as the key parameter controlling floc settling velocity and has been studied by many researchers e g dyer 1989 manning et al 2006 soulsby et al 2013 droppo et al 2015 however we found that the same size may correspond to many different settling velocities and large flocs did not guarantee improved settling velocity see fig 3 fig 5 this variability in settling velocity for similar floc size could be explained by the multiple floc fractal structures and fractal dimensions for the same floc size due to different aggregation and breakup mechanisms moreover floc fractal dimensions tended to decrease with increasing floc size and changed with the environmental conditions such as turbulent shear and salinity improved knowledge in floc fractal properties will help to better understand flocculation dynamics and their impacts on the transport and fate of fine sediment and associated contaminants and nutrients thus shedding light on the management of navigation channel and protection of the estuarine system of the ye as well as other estuaries with the similar conditions 5 conclusions in this study the effects of turbulent shear rates salinity and suspended sediment concentration on floc properties in terms of floc size distributions and floc fractal dimensions were explored a series of laboratory experiments with silt dominant mixed sediment were conducted in an annular flume and the floc size and settling velocity information were simultaneously obtained by the low intrusive optical instrument of labsfloc 2 the experimental results suggest significant sediment flocculation under both freshwater and saltwater conditions as the turbulent shear rate increased floc size showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with the peak value under the medium shear rate of g 40 s 1 and g 20 30 s 1 for freshwater and saltwater respectively salinity promotes floc development by modifying the electrochemical properties of the sediment surface and the median floc size in saltwater was found to be approximately 1 4 times larger than that in freshwater floc sizes developed in ssc of 350 mg l 1 were greater than those observed in ssc of 150 mg l 1 while the variations of floc size with ssc were less noticeable than that with salinity as flocs grew in size floc fractal dimension n f decreased due to the incorporation of increasing water content and structure modification within flocs and the variations of n f displayed a decreasing tendency turbulence played an important role in controlling floc structure and flocs formed under strong shearing force were more compacted with larger floc fractal dimensions and larger effective densities the n f showed an overall increasing trend with rising g and the mean n f under freshwater and 7 psu saltwater conditions increased by approximately 37 and 28 from the low turbulent shear rate of g 10 s 1 to the high value at g 65 s 1 respectively the n f in freshwater was greater than that in saltwater environment particularly under the moderate to strong turbulent shear rates g 30 65 s 1 ssc up to 350 mg l 1 had showed no significant effects on the variation of floc fractal dimension but the impacts of higher ssc need further study considering the impacts of variable fractal dimension under different turbulent shear rates on the change of floc effective density an improved simulation method considering variable characteristic floc fractal dimension fc based on the khelifa and hill 2006 method was proposed the proposed improved method was more effective in the simulation of floc effective density with floc size compared with the kranenburg 1994 method and the original khelifa and hill 2006 method this study will benefit the understanding of floc fractal property and its impact on the transport and fate of fine

4267,flocculation is an important dynamic process for fine sediment transport a number of physical and biochemical factors affecting flocculation have been identified but quantitative examination of floc structure and fractal property under varying physical conditions is still needed in this contribution we conducted lab experiments using an annular flume and natural sediment to evaluate changes in floc size distributions and fractal dimensions under varying turbulent shear g salinity and suspended sediment concentration ssc the low intrusive optical instrument of labsfloc 2 was deployed to capture images of flocs which enables calculation of floc sizes and settling velocities observations showed that the mean floc size in freshwater first increased with increasing g below a threshold of g 40 s 1 followed by a decrease with further increases in shear the shear threshold was smaller for saline water salinity of 7 psu i e g 20 30 s 1 than that in freshwater the fractal dimension of flocs decreased with an increase in size suggesting more fragile structure for macro flocs turbulent shear appeared to play a dominant role in controlling floc structure flocs formed under large shear force were more compacted and had larger fractal dimensions the floc fractal dimension was 28 37 greater in freshwater than in saline water an improved method considering both floc size and variable fractal dimension is proposed for better simulation of floc effective density the improved understanding of flocculation dynamics and floc structure in this work have implications for fine sediment and adherent nutrients management in varying natural water environments keywords sediment flocculation variable fractal dimension effective density simulation turbulent shear rate 1 introduction flocculation of fine sediment is the result of simultaneous aggregation and break up processes which is an important topic in studies of cohesive sediment transport dynamics and associated water treatment dyer 1989 winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 mehta 2014 hasan and fatehi 2019 the settling velocities of flocs are usually orders of magnitude larger than that of primary particles therefore flocculation plays a crucial role in controlling cohesive sediment mass settling fluxes particularly considering that the majority of cohesive suspended sediments are transported in the form of flocs in varying water environments from rivers to estuaries manning et al 2006 guo and he 2011 soulsby et al 2013 fettweis et al 2014 mehta et al 2014 meanwhile contaminants and nutrients are typically adsorbed to cohesive sediment thus flocculation affects the transport and flux of contaminants and nutrients and water quality pardo et al 2015 ye et al 2020 better understanding of flocculation processes and floc properties is highly desirable in modeling e g winterwerp et al 2006 sheremet et al 2017 and predicting the behaviors of cohesive sediment and adherent contaminants and nutrients one apparent consequence of flocculation is a relative increase in settling velocity compared with the constituent primary particles the settling velocity of flocs is influenced by the floc size and floc internal structure the aggregation and break up processes of flocs are closely related to the physiochemical and biological environment including primary particle properties e g size and mineral composition hydrodynamics suspended sediment concentration ssc salinity and organic matter gibbs 1983 van leussen 1994 winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 mietta et al 2009 droppo et al 2015 lee et al 2017 turbulent shearing is one of the most important factors affecting the cohesive sediment flocculation processes dyer 1989 winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 on the one hand turbulence promotes the aggregation and development of flocs by accelerating particle collisions on the other hand when it is too large the shearing force may exceed the cohesion between particles resulting in the breakage of flocs dyer and manning 1999 it has been found in previous work that the size of the flocs is mainly controlled by the turbulent kolmogorov microscale η coufort et al 2005 mietta et al 2009 kumar et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 most studies have focused on the effects of these factors on the development of floc size however the understanding of floc structure under various environmental conditions is insufficient sterling et al 2004 kumar et al 2010 ren et al 2017 the floc structure has effects on physical properties such as porosity dewatering density and drag force acting on the floc which makes it a key factor in determining floc settling velocity logan and kilps 1995 previous studies have demonstrated that flocculation kinetics during aggregation and breakup processes are strongly affected by floc structure jiang and logan 1991 maggi 2007 direct measurements of floc structures have been attempted but it is technically challenging and usually only a limited number of individual flocs have been examined e g spencer et al 2010 wheatland et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 being different from primary particles or non cohesive sediment the floc structures are often treated as fractal entities and mathematically quantified by fractal dimension kranenburg 1994 chung and lee 2003 the underlying concept of the fractal dimension is self similarity and it was first formally introduced in cohesive sediment research by kranenburg 1994 though tambo and watanabe 1979 had suggested a similar approach earlier three kinds of fractal dimensions are documented i e one two and three dimensional values indicating linear planar and volumetric properties respectively for example the two dimensional fractal dimension is also known as perimeter based fractal dimension n p which is estimated by the projected area and floc perimeter describing the expansion of area as the perimeter increases spicer and pratsinis 1996 he et al 2012 ren et al 2017 three dimensional fractal dimension n f is the most representative and practical indicator because it describes the space filling ability of actual flocs and could be applied directly in modeling flocs hydrodynamic characteristics and settling velocities winterwerp 1998 khelifa and hill 2006 maggi 2007 unfortunately a direct measure of floc n f without altering fragile floc structure is needed to reconstruct three dimensional structure which is practically challenging chu and lee 2004 a few indirect methods have been suggested to obtain floc n f including estimates based on the perimeter based fractal dimension floc effective density and settling velocity kranenburg 1994 maggi and winterwerp 2004 kumar et al 2010 theoretically the floc s three dimensional fractal dimension n f ranges from 1 to 3 the smaller the n f the looser the floc structure and the more easily it can be destroyed in contrast the larger the n f the denser the structure and the higher the stability a large number of field observations and laboratory test results have shown that the range of n f is mainly between 1 4 and 2 6 jiang and logan 1991 kranenburg 1994 khelifa and hill 2006 verney et al 2009 wang et al 2011 manning and schoellhamer 2013 winterwerp 1998 recommended using a constant value of 2 as a representative n f in estimation of floc settling velocity however several other studies have noticed that n f was highly variable during floc aggregation and break up processes chakraborti et al 2003 maggi 2007 vahedi and gorczyca 2012 moruzzi et al 2017 the fractal dimension of flocs was found to vary with shear rate floc size organic matter and the restructuring processes etc van leussen 1994 stone and krishnappan 2003 sterling et al 2004 showed that the fractal dimension of flocs increased with rising turbulent shear rates it was demonstrated that aggregation mechanisms such as particle cluster aggregation and cluster cluster aggregation have significant effects on floc fractal dimension logan 1999 vahedi and gorczyca 2011 jiang and logan 1991 found that the flocs formed due to differential settling were relatively smaller in fractal dimension in a range of 1 6 2 3 compared with those formed under turbulent shearing n f greater than 2 4 however chen and eisma 1995 reported no correlation between floc fractal dimension and the governing processes of flocculation meanwhile many researchers have suggested that floc fractal dimensions change with the floc size for example risović and martinis 1996 found that as the floc sizes increased from 2 μm to 200 μm their fractal dimensions decreased from about 2 5 to 1 7 the n f was 3 for primary particles and decreased with increasing floc size in a power law function khelifa and hill 2006 maggi 2007 kumar et al 2010 guo et al 2018 two stages of negative linear correlations between fractal dimension and floc size were reported in vahedi and gorczyca 2011 as the result of two mechanisms involved in the floc formation overall it remains an open question how environmental conditions flocculation processes and floc sizes may affect floc structures and floc fractal dimensions to improve understanding of the controls on floc structure and fractal dimensions a series of controlled laboratory experiments were conducted with measurements of floc size and settling velocity under various levels of turbulent shearing salinity and sediment concentration the objective was to further explore how floc fractal dimension evolved in response to varying environmental conditions which would improve the understanding and prediction in the transport of cohesive sediment and associated contaminants and nutrients 2 laboratory experiments 2 1 apparatus and materials laboratory experiments of this study were conducted in an annular flume in the brunel laboratory plymouth university uk the annular flume has an outer diameter of 120 cm a channel width of 10 cm and a depth of 15 cm along with a detachable roof the annular flume is a research proven tool which is able to obtain fully developed open flow conditions as a result of the infinite flow length and can be used to create repeatable and consistent turbulent environment stone and krishnappan 2003 floc properties were obtained by the labsfloc 2 laboratory spectral flocculation characteristics version 2 instrument which utilized a low intrusive high resolution video camera to observe flocs as they settled in a perspex settling column manning et al 2007 2010 floc sizes and settling velocities can be obtained simultaneously by the labsfloc 2 which has a distinct advantage over laser particle instruments like lisst laser in situ scattering and transmissiometry the labsfloc 2 camera resolution can practically resolve flocs from 10 μm to 8 mm in size settling velocities generally ranging from 0 01 mm s 1 to 45 mm s 1 can be measured by labsfloc 2 the annular flume and similar camera system have been successfully utilized in a few works e g manning and dyer 1999 gratiot and manning 2004 manning et al 2010 the sediment used in the experiments were collected from the surface bed in the turbidity maximum zone tmz of the yangtze estuary ye china which is a river tide controlled highly turbid and muddy estuary fig 1 a the water depth of the sampling site the middle segment of the north passage the core region of the tmz was approximately 13 m below mean water level tidal waves mainly have a range of 2 4 m and tidal currents are asymmetrical with stronger peak ebb currents than flood current velocities sediment samples were collected during neap tide with the peak ebb and flood current velocities of 1 4 m s 1 and 0 9 m s 1 respectively turbulent shear rate near the bottom layer varied mainly in the range of about 3 30 s 1 during the whole tidal cycle guo et al 2017 salinity was lower than 2 psu most of the time during the sampling and the maximum salinity was about 11 psu the mean ssc was about 0 24 g l 1 and the bottom ssc was 1 73 g l 1 during the neap tide sampling however the maximum bottom ssc could reach 10 g l 1 at spring tides inducing strong siltation and maintenance dredging demand in the navigational waterway guo et al 2017 lin et al 2021 the primary particle size distributions of the sediment samples were analyzed using a mastersizer 2000 measuring range 0 02 2000 μm reproducibility error 3 after h2o2 and sodium metaphosphate treatment and 15 min of sonification these chemical and physical treatments were expected to remove organic matter and break all the aggregated particles into primary ones results showed that the median diameter of the sediment particles was 11 7 μm specifically the sediment has a content of 17 clay 4 μm 72 silt 4 62 μm 8 very fine sand 62 5 125 μm and 3 fine and medium sand 125 500 μm fig 1b organic matter content of the sediment was about 3 1 which was determined through mass loss in ignition at 450 c for 6 h 2 2 experimental processes the laboratory experiments included 18 runs with 6 runs in freshwater a1 a6 with ssc of 150 mg l 1 and 12 in saline water with salinity of 7 0 5 psu b1 b6 and c1 c6 under sscs of 150 mg l 1 and 350 mg l 1 respectively tap water was used in the experiments as fresh water and cooking salt was added to create saline water experiments the water temperature was around 20 during all experiments ssc of 150 mg l 1 was implemented in both fresh and saline water experiments and a higher ssc of 350 mg l 1 c1 c6 was additionally considered in the saltwater environment for each concentration six increments of turbulent shear rate ranging from 10 s 1 to 65 s 1 at the sampling height were created in the flume to shear the sediment slurries the conditions and environmental variables in the laboratory experiments were selected from within the ranges experienced in the field at the sampling site and a summary of the experimental conditions can be found in table 1 experiments started from the highest shear rate and decreased step by step towards the lowest one as the runs progressed in each run sediment mixtures were sheared under the same turbulence for 30 min then halting the flume motor and sampling two volumes using a modified pipette with internal diameter of 6 mm the sampling was made at a height 20 mm from the flume bed one sample was used to determine the ssc by the method of filtration and drying and the other one was transferred immediately to the labsfloc 2 settling column in order to minimize any aggregation or break up the results of ssc analysis showed that variations of ssc under different turbulent shear for a given run was within 20 suggesting that ssc was relatively stable during the experiments the aperture of the pipette was brought into contact with the settling column water surface allowing flocs in the pipette to settle by gravitation fig 2 to reduce the effects of density contrast the settling column was filled with water of the same temperature and salinity as the annular flume fluid this floc sub sampling method is a proven sampling technique see gratiot and manning 2004 mietta et al 2009 manning et al 2010 kumar et al 2010 2 3 data analysis floc images were recorded in real time as a series of avi format files at an acquisition rate of 7 5 frames per second a total of 5963 flocs were measured in 18 experiments these files were then converted into consecutive images using a matlab frame grabbing routine the hr wallingford ltd digifloc software manning et al 2017 was then used to semi automatically process images to obtain floc size and settling velocity spectra by measuring both major dx and minor dy axis of the closest ellipse inscribing the floc a spherically equivalent floc diameter d could be determined from 2 1 d d x d y as the time step between two frames one frame 0 133 s is known settling velocity ws can be calculated by measuring the vertical distance a floc travels between two frames then a modified version of stokes law was used to estimate floc effective density by 2 2 ρ e 18 μ w s d 2 g where g is the gravitational acceleration and μ is the dynamic molecular viscosity when flocs exhibited high particle reynolds numbers e g re w s d ν 0 5 where ν is kinematic viscosity indicating flocs fell beyond the viscous reynolds region the oseen modification was applied to account for the inertial drag during floc settling hill et al 1998 manning and dyer 2002 2 3 ρ eoseen 18 μ w s d 2 g 1 3 c 16 r e where c is a constant of 0 43 hill et al 1998 floc fractal dimension n f was estimated using kranenburg 1994 2 4 ρ e ρ p ρ w d d n f 3 in which ρ w is water density at 20 1000 kg m 3 for freshwater and 1006 kg m 3 for 7 psu saltwater and d is the median diameter of the primary particle d50 ρ p is primary particle density which is estimated to be 2570 kg m 3 given an organic matter mass ratio of 3 and a density of 1300 kg m 3 for organic matter and a density of 2600 kg m 3 for the mineral fraction 3 results results showed that the floc size d ranged between 20 μm and 413 μm 45 7 of which were over 120 μm the ws varied from 0 2 mm s 1 to 10 0 mm s 1 with the median ws of 1 2 mm s 1 the estimated minimum and maximum floc effective densities ρ e were 3 6 kg m 3 and 1691 kg m 3 respectively 3 1 freshwater flocculation in the freshwater experiments a total of 991 particles were observed floc size d ranged between 27 μm and 260 μm whilst floc settling velocity ws varied from 0 2 mm s 1 to 7 8 mm s 1 fig 3 a 3c illustrate the distributions of d and ws for samples under the highest a1 g 65 s 1 moderate a3 g 40 s 1 and lowest a6 g 10 s 1 shear rates respectively for the same floc size the settling velocities varied in a considerable range and vice versa the median d of each run varied between 38 μm and 66 μm which was 3 6 times of the median size of primary particle d50 11 7 μm the maximum and minimum floc sizes were detected at g 40 s 1 a3 and g 10 s 1 a6 respectively the median ws changed between 0 3 mm s 1 and 1 4 mm s 1 and it decreased with a decline in g the diagonal lines in fig 3a 3c represent contours of floc ρ e calculated by stokes s law indicating that the effective densities of flocs formed in freshwater were mainly in the range of 160 1600 kg m 3 the floc effective density in a1 was the largest overall with about 18 3 exceeding 1300 kg m 3 and with a median ρ e of 950 kg m 3 the median ρ e of all particles obtained in fresh water experiments was around 780 kg m 3 to aid the interpretation of the floc characteristics each floc population was divided into ten size bands sbs from 40 μm to greater than 360 μm at an interval of 40 μm considering the observed floc size ranges the sb distributions of floc number and mean floc ws at a1 a3 and a6 are shown in fig 3d 3f cases a1 and a3 covered seven sbs from 40 μm to 280 μm and the majority of flocs concentrated in the sb of 40 80 μm floc sizes in case a6 spanned a relatively narrow range which contained only the smallest two sbs with 60 of flocs 40 μm in size the mean ws at different sbs in a1 first increased from 0 7 mm s 1 sb1 to 2 4 mm s 1 sb4 then decreased gradually with the increase in d variations of mean ws in a3 were similar to that of a1 except for the sharp rise from sb6 to sb7 at the lowest shear rate case of a6 floc mean ws increased from 0 3 mm s 1 sb1 to 0 4 mm s 1 sb2 3 2 saltwater flocculation there were 12 floc populations obtained in the 7 psu saltwater experiments including 4972 observed flocs in total in the cases of b1 b6 floc size d changed between 25 μm and 330 μm and ws ranged from 0 2 mm s 1 to 7 0 mm s 1 some specific results under the ssc of 150 mg l 1 are presented in fig 4 as g decreased from 65 s 1 to 10 s 1 the median d in the experimental runs b1 b3 and b6 were 97 μm 130 μm and 107 μm respectively with the peak value under g 40 s 1 whilst the maximum and minimum floc mean ws occurred under the largest and smallest turbulent shear rates respectively when g 65 s 1 about 83 of the floc ρ e exceeded 160 kg m 3 and as g decreased floc ρ e showed a decreasing tendency more than 60 of floc ρ e was in the range of 16 160 kg m 3 under the shear rate of 10 s 1 compared with the results in freshwater the floc sizes under a salinity of 7 psu were distributed over a wider size range 25 330 μm in saline water as opposed to 27 260 μm in freshwater the highest shear case b1 had the smallest size range including six sbs 40 280 μm the majority of flocs were concentrated in sb of 80 120 μm under both shear rates of 65 s 1 and 10 s 1 however it shifted to a larger sb of 120 160 μm when g 40 s 1 the largest floc mean ws of about 4 0 mm s 1 appeared in the sb of 120 160 μm in b1 case under the highest shear whilst the smallest mean ws occurred in the 40 μm sb in b3 under the lowest shear which was only 0 3 mm s 1 in the cases with ssc of 350 mg l 1 floc size d changed from 20 μm to 420 μm and the floc ws varied in 0 2 10 0 mm s 1 fig 5 demonstrates the specific results under the shear rates of 65 s 1 40 s 1 and 10 s 1 with the decreasing turbulent shear rate the median d increased first and then decreased the largest median floc d of 130 μm was observed at g 40 s 1 median floc ws declined gradually from around 3 3 mm s 1 down to 0 7 mm s 1 with decreasing g as for the changes of floc effective density when the shear rate was large g 65 s 1 ρ e was mainly in the range of 160 1600 kg m 3 however floc ρ e was relatively lower at g 10 s 1 mainly in the range of 16 160 kg m 3 the sb with the largest proportion of flocs was similar to the results under the ssc of 150 mg l 1 concentrating in the ranges of 80 120 μm and 120 160 μm the floc mean ws was found to first increase and then decrease with the increase of floc sb and the largest value of approximately 6 0 mm s 1 occurred in the sb of 200 240 μm the smallest floc mean ws appeared in the 40 80 μm sb at c6 which was about 0 6 mm s 1 3 3 impact of physical conditions on floc size development 3 3 1 turbulent shear variation of floc size distribution with g under different salinities and sscs in this study is shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the median floc size obtained in each group of experiments was significantly larger than the median primary sediment size d50 11 7 μm indicating that flocculation occurred in all the experimental cases in freshwater and saltwater under varied g and ssc but there was a difference in the degree of flocculation flocs in freshwater conditions were notably smaller than the turbulent kolmogorov micro scale η as the increase of g η decreases floc size showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with the largest value found in the medium shear rate of g 40 s 1 it suggests that in the freshwater experiment when g 40 s 1 the increase of turbulence promoted the development of flocs while when g exceeded a critical value of 40 s 1 flow turbulence played a dominant role in floc break up leading to a decrease in floc size with further increase in turbulence shear in saltwater conditions the largest floc size and η were on the same order of magnitude and they were positively correlated although some floc sizes exceeded η which was consistent with previous studies in that turbulent shear rate was crucial in controlling the maximum floc size median floc sizes were all smaller than η and the peak median floc sizes appeared at g 20 30 s 1 showing that the overall median floc sizes in 7 psu saltwater also tended to increase first and then decrease as g increased 3 4 salinity and ssc according to the results in freshwater and saltwater under the same ssc 150 mg l 1 flocs formed under a 7 psu salinity were significantly larger the median floc size in salt water was approximately 2 4 times of that in freshwater under the same turbulent shear rate this difference indicates that the presence of salinity could promote floc development by modifying the electrochemical properties of the sediment surface for the natural mixed sediment flocs developed in a higher ssc of 350 mg l 1 were greater in size than those in 150 mg l 1 in saltwater indicating that increasing ssc would enhance floc growth due to accelerating particle collision frequencies van der lee 2000 verney et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 note that the variations of floc size with ssc was less noticeable than those with salinity 4 discussion 4 1 controls and impacts of floc fractal property a constant value of 2 was advocated by winterwerp 1998 as the representation of floc fractal dimension in the simulation of floc settling velocity in estuaries nevertheless many researchers suggested a variable fractal dimension to better define floc structure maggi 2007 kumar et al 2010 guo et al 2018 in this study the mean n f calculated by formula 2 4 of flocs in freshwater case a ssc 150 mg l 1 and 7 psu saltwater case b ssc 150 mg l 1 case c ssc 350 mg l 1 experiments were 2 46 2 06 and 2 09 respectively fig 7 flocs formed in the freshwater environment were overall more compacted with a higher n f although the mean n f of 2 08 in saltwater was similar to that suggested by winterwerp 1998 a non constant and widely distributed n f was observed in the experiments n f showed a decreasing trend with the increase of floc size and a power law was proposed with r 0 55 n 5963 for all points the mean n f decreased by about 31 from 2 38 0 38 for flocs between 20 and 100 μm down to 1 65 0 20 for flocs larger than 300 μm table 2 these trends confirm the earlier studies that as flocs grew in size the floc structure changed too khelifa and hill 2006 maggi 2007 the decrease in floc fractal dimension with the increase of floc size could be explained by the increase of primary particles number and the increase of the possible internal arrangements within the flocs as well as factors such as floc breakup and restructuring of internal particles maggi 2007 vahedi and gorczyca 2012 as floc sizes grow their porosities increase and can even exceed 90 and due to the incorporation of increasing water content within flocs floc effective densities tend to decline along with increased fragility in floc structure and lower fractal dimension de boer et al 2000 manning et al 2007 fig 8 presents the change of mean n f with turbulent shear rate under different salinities and sscs from the experiments n f showed an overall increasing trend with the rising of g and the mean n f under freshwater and salinity of 7 psu increased by approximately 37 and 28 from around 1 89 and 1 88 at g 10 s 1 to about 2 58 and 2 41 at g 65 s 1 respectively as the larger the fractal dimension the more stable and denser are the flocs winterwerp 1998 verney et al 2009 floc effective density and settling velocity would be greater if the fractal dimension was larger for the same size this could explain why the peak median floc size occurred at moderate g while the median floc settling velocity increased with g see figs 3 5 it also suggests that the effects of floc structure and its effective density on the floc settling velocity may be more significant than that of the floc size the fractal dimension of flocs obtained in the experiments using natural mixed sediment increased with the increase of turbulent shear rate which was similar to the experimental results of sterling et al 2004 using clay particles they found that floc fractal dimension increased from approximately 1 9 to 2 3 as g increased from 5 s 1 to 50 s 1 in an environment of strong turbulence loosely structured flocs are likely to break up under the shearing force and a restructuring and reformation of primary particles or small flocs occur which would lead to the more compact flocs spicer and pratsinis 1996 vahedi and gorczyca 2012 thus the structure of the remaining flocs will be relatively stronger with large fractal dimension and difficult to be destroyed in contrast lower density flocs exhibiting a high porosity structural matrix are more likely to survive in the environment of weak turbulence resulting in an overall smaller floc fractal dimension chakraborti et al 2003 therefore there will be large differences in the structure of flocs formed in different hydrodynamic environments even for flocs with the same size flocs formed under weak turbulence are relatively loose and the floc fractal dimension and effective density are usually small while the flocs formed under strong shearing force are more compact with larger floc fractal dimension and effective density regarding the effects of salinity on the fractal dimension of floc kumar et al 2010 found that n f was mainly between 2 1 and 2 5 in freshwater which was higher than that in saltwater conditions i e 1 9 2 1 in 10 psu salinity and 1 9 2 2 in 15 psu salinity results in this study showed that floc n f in freshwater cases ranged from 1 9 to 2 6 which was also greater than 1 8 2 3 in 7 psu saltwater environment particularly under moderate to strong turbulence g 30 65 s 1 under the same salinity and g with the increase of ssc from 150 mg l 1 to 350 mg l 1 the changes of n f were small and inconsistent and no significant difference was found when g 10 20 s 1 the mean n f was larger in lower ssc however it became the reverse when g was at 30 65 s 1 note that the effects of high sediment concentration on floc structure may be significant such as when the ssc exceeds 3 4 g l 1 a network structure between flocs may form and result in a hindered settling winterwerp 2002 in this work it is clear that we should not only take into consideration the dynamics of floc size but also pay special attention to the variability of floc fractal dimension in understanding the flocculation processes under varied environments 4 2 improved estimation of floc settling velocity the settling velocity of non cohesive sediment mainly relies on the particle size as the particle density usually remains constant however the simulation of floc settling velocity is much more complicated since the floc effective density is highly variable due to the modification of floc structure during the floc aggregation and break up processes a few methods have been proposed to simulate the variation of floc effective density for example kranenburg 1994 suggested that ρ e ρ p ρ w d d n f 3 based on the self similar fractal theory and floc fractal dimension n f was set as a fixed value usually n f 2 for a certain simulation a quasi self similar concept that n f changed with floc size was proposed by khelifa and hill 2006 and the work of maggi 2007 and kumar et al 2010 also confirmed the variation of floc fractal dimension with size the khelifa and hill 2006 method showed that n f equals 3 for primary particles and then decreases with floc size in a power law function n f 3 d d β β l o g f c 3 l o g d fc d where dfc is a characteristic floc size and fc is the corresponding fractal dimension when floc size increases to dfc fig 9 demonstrates the correlations between floc effective densities and floc sizes from the freshwater experiments under varying turbulent shear it shows an overall decrease of effective density as floc size increased with r 0 74 0 82 and 0 85 for the relative high g 50 s 1 and 65 s 1 fig 10 a moderate g 30 s 1 and 40 s 1 fig 10b and low g 10 s 1 and 20 s 1 fig 9c turbulent shear rates respectively we found that the best fit of khelifa and hill 2006 method had different fc under varying turbulences in the simulation of the change of floc effective density with size it maybe because the characteristic floc fractal dimension fc was closely related to the flocculation environments in particular the flow turbulent shear rate see fig 8 although the best fit of khelifa and hill 2006 method with fc 2 for all the data points was acceptable the scattering of data points was still wide which could lead to large errors in the estimation of floc settling velocity in order to reduce the scatter we proposed an improved khelifa and hill 2006 method with variable fc as f c n ft e kg where n ft was the characteristic floc fractal dimension fc in still water g 0 k was a constant parameter according to the freshwater experimental results n ft was 1 13 and k was 0 012 to quantify the behavior of different simulation methods the root mean square error rmse of simulation results by the kranenburg 1994 method the khelifa and hill 2006 method and the improved method were calculated results showed that rmse of the improved method was the smallest one which was about 48 and 19 smaller than that of the kranenburg 1994 method with n f 2 and the khelifa and hill 2006 method with fc 2 respectively as for the cases of saltwater experiments the improved method with n ft 1 45 and k 0 006 was also found to be the best behaved simulation method rmse of the improved method was about 25 and 14 smaller than that of the kranenburg 1994 method with n f 2 and the khelifa and hill 2006 method with fc 1 9 respectively fig 10 these results suggest that by including the dynamic floc fractal dimension under varied turbulence the improved khelifa and hill 2006 method proposed in this study is more effective in the simulation of variation of the floc effective density with floc size compared to the kranenburg 1994 method and the original khelifa and hill 2006 method note that organic matter content of the sediment was about 3 and it has been demonstrated that organic matter types and contents may have significant influences on floc fractal and effective density mietta et al 2009 fettweis and baeye 2015 lee et al 2017 therefore the use of the proposed improved method under the effects of varied organic matter properties requires further investigation 4 3 implications for flocculation in natural environment training works in the north passage of the ye where the sediments were collected and used in the laboratory experiments have suffered from severe siltation resulting in considerable dredging requirements 60 90 million m3 every year and cost song and wang 2013 it was demonstrated that flocculation and enhanced settling of fine sediment was ascribed to play an important role in the positive feedback loop of vertical mixing and settling which leads to the regime shift in estuaries and siltation within the navigational channel guo et al 2017 lin et al 2021 meanwhile the accurate determination of floc settling velocity has been regarded as a top priority in improving modelling sediment transportation according to the experimental results in this study floc settling velocities were highly variable in the range of 0 2 10 0 mm s 1 the median ws was 1 2 mm s 1 under different environmental conditions floc size is usually taken as the key parameter controlling floc settling velocity and has been studied by many researchers e g dyer 1989 manning et al 2006 soulsby et al 2013 droppo et al 2015 however we found that the same size may correspond to many different settling velocities and large flocs did not guarantee improved settling velocity see fig 3 fig 5 this variability in settling velocity for similar floc size could be explained by the multiple floc fractal structures and fractal dimensions for the same floc size due to different aggregation and breakup mechanisms moreover floc fractal dimensions tended to decrease with increasing floc size and changed with the environmental conditions such as turbulent shear and salinity improved knowledge in floc fractal properties will help to better understand flocculation dynamics and their impacts on the transport and fate of fine sediment and associated contaminants and nutrients thus shedding light on the management of navigation channel and protection of the estuarine system of the ye as well as other estuaries with the similar conditions 5 conclusions in this study the effects of turbulent shear rates salinity and suspended sediment concentration on floc properties in terms of floc size distributions and floc fractal dimensions were explored a series of laboratory experiments with silt dominant mixed sediment were conducted in an annular flume and the floc size and settling velocity information were simultaneously obtained by the low intrusive optical instrument of labsfloc 2 the experimental results suggest significant sediment flocculation under both freshwater and saltwater conditions as the turbulent shear rate increased floc size showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with the peak value under the medium shear rate of g 40 s 1 and g 20 30 s 1 for freshwater and saltwater respectively salinity promotes floc development by modifying the electrochemical properties of the sediment surface and the median floc size in saltwater was found to be approximately 1 4 times larger than that in freshwater floc sizes developed in ssc of 350 mg l 1 were greater than those observed in ssc of 150 mg l 1 while the variations of floc size with ssc were less noticeable than that with salinity as flocs grew in size floc fractal dimension n f decreased due to the incorporation of increasing water content and structure modification within flocs and the variations of n f displayed a decreasing tendency turbulence played an important role in controlling floc structure and flocs formed under strong shearing force were more compacted with larger floc fractal dimensions and larger effective densities the n f showed an overall increasing trend with rising g and the mean n f under freshwater and 7 psu saltwater conditions increased by approximately 37 and 28 from the low turbulent shear rate of g 10 s 1 to the high value at g 65 s 1 respectively the n f in freshwater was greater than that in saltwater environment particularly under the moderate to strong turbulent shear rates g 30 65 s 1 ssc up to 350 mg l 1 had showed no significant effects on the variation of floc fractal dimension but the impacts of higher ssc need further study considering the impacts of variable fractal dimension under different turbulent shear rates on the change of floc effective density an improved simulation method considering variable characteristic floc fractal dimension fc based on the khelifa and hill 2006 method was proposed the proposed improved method was more effective in the simulation of floc effective density with floc size compared with the kranenburg 1994 method and the original khelifa and hill 2006 method this study will benefit the understanding of floc fractal property and its impact on the transport and fate of fine

4268,this study analyses the impact of a thick vadose zone on gaseous transfers and excess air ea formation using dissolved noble and anthropogenic gas tracers ne ar n2 cfc sf6 o2 and co2 understanding gas transfers integrates the issues of equilibrium and water air exchanges along the vadose zone in this study the noble and anthropogenic gases were analysed in air and water over vadose zone depths of 120 m and over two contrasted hydrodynamic periods therefore enabling a rare insight into the spatial and seasonal variations of equilibrium and water air exchanges in a heterogeneous karst environment the results highlight that both noble and anthropogenic gases of the caves are in equilibrium with the atmosphere up to at least depths of 120 m in water the noble gas temperature ngt remains stable at 8 c whilst some ea is formed up to 1 3 cm3 stp kg at 120 m during transfers in the vadose zone the high ea concentrations measured at the spring outlet until 10 7 cm3 stp kg cannot be explained by an increase during transfers via the vadose zone this high ea concentration is due to rapid and high water level variations during recharge the implications of these results are important to advance our understanding in the use of noble and anthropogenic gases in characterising recharge and quantifying groundwater residence times in particular these results help to identify the parts of the aquifer actively involved in dissolved gas transfers highlight the futility of using a time lag factor for groundwater residence times in karstic systems and improve our understanding of the ea formation processes keywords dissolved gases excess air ea karstic aquifers thick vadose zone gaseous transfers residence time gaseous tracers 1 introduction in karts systems the vadose zone composed of soil epikarst and the unsaturated zone stephens 1996 plays an important role in controlling the recharge processes of groundwater several methods exist to investigate transfers of water along the vadose zone and address the question of storage dynamics or travel time estimation of recharge water for example many studies of cave drips have been carried out and provide information on the storage capacity of the epikarst williams 1983 tooth and fairchild 2003 musgrove and banner 2004 fairchild et al 2006 garry et al 2008 arbel et al 2010 kluge et al 2010 poulain et al 2015 another approach is numerical modelling which has the advantage of being applicable on a large scale and over long time frames models based on physical processes and using richard s equations are applied to the porous vadose zone that can be assimilated to homogeneous aquifers vereecken et al 2008 these physically based approaches are interesting since they can deal with the degree of saturation of the vadose zone however they cannot take into account the heterogeneous properties of karst šimůnek et al 2003 which is why their application is scarce in karst aquifers globally karstic aquifers provide important groundwater resources e g bakalowicz 2005 stevanović 2018 2019 goldscheider et al 2020 however these aquifers are renowned for their heterogeneous structures including large voids conduits associated with a porous matrix that induce spatially heterogeneous hydrodynamic and hydrochemical properties bakalowicz 2008 this heterogeneity challenges the use of classical hydrogeological methods of investigation including the basic piezometric map to face these issues development of additional innovative methods is essential to investigate and provide an understanding of karst aquifer functioning especially within the vadose zone monitoring of the chemical composition of karstic systems is appropriate for investigating groundwater rock interactions origin and mixing of waters since chemical signatures are defined barnes and allison 1988 plagnes 1997 pinault et al 2001 perrin et al 2003 tooth and fairchild 2003 musgrove and banner 2004 aquilina et al 2005 carrasco et al 2006 fairchild et al 2006 kluge et al 2010 knierim et al 2013 kogovsek and petric 2014 sánchez et al 2015 however they fail to inform about physical processes such as air water equilibrium matrix conduits exchange and recharge conditions that affect water transfers from the surface to the spring in particular little is known of the temperature and pressure conditions during recharge even though such parameters can be critical in understanding hydrogeological processes dissolved gases are sensitive to recharge conditions as their solubility in water depends on recharge temperature salinity and pressure weiss 1970 1971 for noble gases since their partial pressure in the atmosphere remains stable their concentration in water only depends on the recharge conditions and especially temperature aeschbach hertig et al 1999 2000 manning and solomon 2003 ingram et al 2007 with inverse models noble gases have been used to determine the groundwater recharge temperature known as noble gas temperature ngt aeschbach hertig et al 1999 ballentine and hall 1999 which in turn can be used to infer information about the recharge period chatton et al 2016 moreover numerous studies have shown that the concentrations of dissolved noble gases in water can be higher than expected from the application of henry s law herzberg and mazor 1979 heaton and vogel 1981 stute et al 1995a 1995b this phenomenon is known as excess air ea it is usually taken into account as a corrective term of dissolved gas concentrations in the application of dating methods using gases tracers such as cfcs sf6 or he two assumptions have been made for ea formation firstly herzberg and mazor 1979 and mazor et al 1983 suggested that during water transfers along the vadose zone the air is sucked into the water in this case the concentration of ea is linked to the vadose zone thickness secondly stute and schlosser 2000 and aeschbach hertig 2004 explained that ea formation is via the entrapment of air bubbles after a rapid increase in the water table where the hydrostatic pressure increases during the water level change forces gas dissolution in this case concentrations of ea depend on water table fluctuations with higher values due to rapid and larger increases in the water table ingram et al 2007 massmann and sültenfuß 2008 in karst systems the vadose zones are often thick for example in the mediterranean area the vadose zone can be up to 400 m mudry and puig 1991 fleury et al 2007 moreover groundwater levels in karst aquifers can undergo rapid increases during recharge events several tens of meters e g bailly comte et al 2008 finally in karst systems the presence of an epikarst can often be associated with perched water tables klimchouk et al 2000 bakalowicz 2004 klimchouk 2004 such characteristics can significantly impact air water equilibrium gas transfers and ea formation despite this the composition and evolution of the dissolved gases in the vadose zones of karstic systems are poorly documented therefore the use of dissolved gases in karst systems raises the following fundamental questions relating to the processes of air water equilibrium i does the equilibrium occur at the surface of the epikarst or at the surface of the water table base of the vadose zone ii if the equilibrium occurs at the surface of the epikarst is the air in caves located at the bottom of a thick unsaturated zone still equilibrated with the atmospheric air and iii is there re equilibration during transfers along the thick vadose zone such questions are important for the application of dissolved gases as environmental tracers of recharge conditions and residence times in karst aquifers in particular the determination of the concentrations of cfcs and sf6 to be used for the calculation of water residence times may depend on the consideration of a time lag coefficient in the case of thick unsaturated zones the study of ea is also required to improve our understanding of links with the aquifer structure and or hydrodynamics and the quantification of groundwater residence times using gaseous dating tracers e g cfcs and sf6 to address these questions in this study the dissolved noble and anthropogenic gas tracers neon ne argon ar nitrogen n2 chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 were measured in both air and water at different depths along a thick vadose zone 120 m deep of a karst aquifer with a well developed epikarst this allowed us to identify the i air composition evolution along the vadose zone and its equilibrium with the atmosphere ii gas evolution in air and in water to identify the equilibrium depth for dissolution of gases and iii mechanisms of ea formation in a karstic system 2 study area the area of investigation is located in a jurassic carbonate plateau of the causse du larzac south of france and has an elevation between 700 and 900 m asl this site is part of the natural regional park of the grand causse pnrgc it is one of the study sites of the french national observation services h http hplus ore fr which is part of the elter european infrastructure https deims org 83b01fa5 747f

and limestone of the early jurassic and ii the middle to upper jurassic these two carbonate series are separated by the toarcian marls that outcrop at the hospitalet s fault which constrains the emergence of the durzon s spring at the base of the middle jurassic carbonates fig 1 a the climate of the causse du larzac is mediterranean defined by wet winter and spring months until a monthly average of 8 mm calculated for the 2007 2019 period and a dry summer monthly average less than 2 mm calculated for the 2007 2019 period autumn is characterised by intense rainfall events caused by cevenol episodes with rainfall peaks that can reach up to 290 mm day fig 1 this period constitutes an important recharge period for the aquifer in this study we refer to high and low water conditions to define two states observed during the hydrological cycle the high water condition results from the autumn winter and spring rainfall recharge and is characterised by high spring flow and groundwater levels towards the beginning of the dry season the low water condition is mainly during the dry season when the spring flow and groundwater levels are lower the mean potential evapotranspiration is 2 5 mm day with a maximum value of 9 mm day during summer fig 1 the air temperature is between 14 c and 35 c with an average of 11 c during recharge periods of spring and autumn the average monthly air temperatures vary between 6 c and 16 c fig 1 the durzon s spring located at 533 m asl with a mean flow of 1 5 m3 s tritz et al 2011 drains a surface area between 98 and 117 km2 estimated by dye tracing ricard and bakalowicz 1996 fores 2016 fig 2 a the aquifer is unconfined in the two blocks located on each side of the hospitalet fault the saturated zone is developed within the middle jurassic dolomite in the southern region and both within the middle jurassic dolomite and the middle jurassic limestone to the north of the hospitalet fault the durzon spring is the main spring that drains the catchment and therefore represents catchment scale hydrodynamic and hydrogeochemical information the durzon system is characterised by a thick vadose zone up to 120 m deep south of the hospitalet s fault and an epikarst developed in the dolomite weathered to dolomitic sands especially in the southern part of the catchment this lithology allows an important storage of water in the near surface one manifestation of this storage is the formation of temporary lakes mainly located south of the catchment that were last filled in 2014 fores 2016 these changes in geology vadose zone depths and epikarst thicknesses results in heterogeneous hydraulic properties of the vadose zone between the southern and the northern regions of the durzon spring catchment water storage in the vadose zone of the study area has previously been investigated through the use of several geophysical methods that couple gravimetry and seismology with hydrology these studies confirmed the important role of the epikarst for vadose zone water storage jacob 2009 deville 2013 in addition the fluxes from the epikarst were modeled based on continuous gravimetric measurements site of la jasse the larzac observatory the results showed that this flow can correspond to the spring s base flow fores et al 2017 from this conceptual model of the durzon the storage compartment of the system is only referred to the epikarst located at the top of the aquifer and no reference to the saturated zone located at the bottom is made several accessible caves in the vadose zone are present in the southern area of the hospitalet s fault the bise cave reaches a depth of 120 m from the grounds surface and there is a stream that flows through the cave that is disconnected from the saturated zone based on the analysis of the durzon spring recession curves the karst system shows an average dynamic volume of 72 mm3 22 mm3 mangin 1975 which highlights the presence of large groundwater reserves at the site plagnes 1997 chemical variations are low during seasonal hydrological changes except for a rapid increase until 40 µs cm in the specific conductivity spc and a decrease in the mg2 concentrations that result from the fast infiltration after recharge events plagnes 1997 high values of mg2 mean value 18 9 mg l concentrations are correlated to the extension of the ruiniform dolomites from the bathonian at the surface of the catchment estimated at 81 7 km2 plagnes 1997 another catchment has been used the ironselle catchment located on the nearby causse méjean 25 km north of the durzon spring and developed in the same geological and climatic context as the durzon spring catchment it presents a comparable structure of a carbonate plateau developed in dolomites and limestone from the jurassic but has a thicker vadose zone than the durzon s catchment allowing a deeper sampling at 395 m depth the only site sampled on this catchment 44 16 20 n 3 16 34 e wsg 84 3 methods 3 1 dataset

dissolved gas samples for cfc 12 sf6 ne ar and n2 analysis have been collected at the durzon spring from 2009 to 2019 with a monthly time step between february 2010 and november 2011 de montety et al 2012 these measurements of gases in the spring were compared with the data obtained in the vadose zone at different stages of the hydrological cycle to determine whether the vadose zone data can partly or fully explain the spring data the catchment is composed of many caves that allow caving activities in some of them water is found in tanks or as underground stream that allow the sample of water the air of the cave can also be sampled so air and water are sampled at different depth along the vadose zone fig 2 b four locations shown in fig 2 a with contrasted depths have been sampled to describe both the epikarstic and vadose zone canalettes and reynelles at 5 and 9 m depth respectively for the epikarstic zone a 45 m deep borehole in the unsaturated zone jasse and an underground river at 120 m depth in the unsaturated zone bise in addition air was sampled at the land s surface 700 m a s l and water was also sampled at the durzon spring two sampling campaigns were undertaken during high and low water conditions march 2018 and sept 2019 respectively to evaluate the seasonal hydrological influence on the gas transfers rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data used in this study are collected by météo france on le caylar station located 14 km south of the site providing daily data since 2004 air temperature is monitored by a flux tower with a precision of 0 1 c located on the catchment the air temperature in the cave of la bise is buffered to 10 8 c all year round pers comm the water level is also monitored in the vadose zone since 2013 in two boreholes of 20 and 51 m depth located on the la jasse site fig 2 a and equipped with a sws ctd diver since 2013 to complement the durzon spring data samples were also collected during the low water condition in a similar karstic catchment the ironselle catchment air samples were collected at 395 m depths in the cheminée cave at the ironselle catchment 3 2 sampling and analysis air samples for noble gas analysis were collected by filling 130 ml glass bottles sealed with rubber caps using syringes the air volume of the bottle was renewed 3 times before sampling with a slight overpressure to avoid later contamination from atmospheric air dissolved noble gases in water were collected in 500 ml glass bottles closed with rubber caps and sealed by a metal ring a small submergable pump mini twister 12 v standard pvc sdec france was used to sample the ironselle spring and the cave waters at the canalettes 5 m depth a peristaltic pump was required due to the very low flow rate sampling was done directly in the cavity where the basin was located so the pump and the tank containing the water were at the same altitude in order to avoid any pressure losses and therefore any decompressions in the pump for the jasse borehole 45 m depth and the durzon spring a grundfos mp1 pump was used samples were collected under water directly in the groundwater or in a bucket to avoid any air contamination after having renewed the water 3 times two or three replicates were collected for each sampling point cfc and sf6 water samples were collected without atmospheric contact in stainless steel ampoules of 40 ml cfc and 300 ml sf6 closed with two stainless steel three way valves in addition for each dissolved gas sample physico chemical parameters t c ph spc and dissolved oxygen do were recorded using a portable multimeter hq40d hach only the groundwater temperature at the jasse borehole was measured by the ctd diver located in the borehole rather than at the land s surface with the portable multimeter hq40d hach both air and water samples were analysed at the condate eau analytical platform university of rennes by gas chromatography analysis for water sample analyses ne ar n2 were extracted by head space and measured by gas chromatography using a catharometer detector µgc 3000 sra with a precision of 8 for ne and 5 for ar and n2 cfcs and sf6 were extracted by the purge and trap method to concentrate the gases and quantified by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector labasque et al 2014 2006 the analyses are within a precision of 3 for cfc 12 and 5 for sf6 in water for air samples excluding the extraction of gases from the liquid phase the analytical process was the same as for water samples the precision repeatability is about 10 mainly due to the low pressure of air samples and then possible contaminations air has been sampled at the surface of the catchment march 2018 high water campaign and in the analysis laboratory september 2019 low water campaign for the calibration every air sample was corrected from this calibration 3 3 calculation of recharge conditions ngt and ea ne ar and n2 can be used to estimate noble gas temperature ngt and

mathiesen et al 1998 mariotti 1986 smith et al 1991 however in karst systems anoxic conditions are rarely found especially in an unconfined reservoir for the durzon system the dissolved oxygen do is always above 7 6 mg l for this reason the n2 dissolved concentration was assumed to remain stable during the hydrological cycle and was used to deduce ngt and ea calculations were performed using the

calculated the uncertainty of ngt and ea was given by the standard deviation of these 100 simulations the gas result corresponds to the mean value of the replicate samples collected at each point we compared the results from our method of calculation using three gases to the results from the use of five noble gases using the work from holocher et al 2002 this comparison shows that the accuracy of the ngt and the ea is more dependent on the analytical uncertainties than the number of gases used for the calculation the use of ar and ne is sufficient to determine ngt and ea as argon dissolution is sensitive to temperature while neon dissolution is sensitive to excess air 3 4 calculation of cfc 12 and sf6 atmospheric pressures determination of groundwater residence times and flow models relies on the calculation of atmospheric mixing ratio pptv using henry s law international atomic energy agency 2006 the influence of the recharge elevation is small for elevations less than 1000 m international atomic energy agency 2006 the durzon karst system is located in a plateau so its elevation does not vary much between 700 and 900 m 200 m of variation induces less than 1 c and 0 2 cm3 stp kg of uncertainties on the ngt and ea parameters respectively so it has been fixed to 700 m asl in this study in contrast recharge temperature is an essential parameter to calculate the coefficient of solubility βi the annual air temperature can be assumed to be close to the recharge temperature herzberg and mazor 1979 however air temperature data representative of the recharge sites is not always available or known therefore another approach is to calculate the recharge temperature based on the water ngt international atomic energy agency 2006 chatton et al 2016 de montety et al 2012 in this study we used the ngt as we generally sampled noble gases and anthropogenic gases at the same time however we noticed some analytical problems for the dissolved noble gases sampled in september 2019 low water condition limiting their use for estimating the ngt for this campaign therefore the mean ngt 9 1 c 2 2 c calculated during low water conditions at the durzon spring between 2009 and 2013 6 values was used the same procedure was applied for ea computation which is an essential corrective term especially for sf6 values 4 results 4 1 evolution of gaseous tracers along the vadose zone results in air samples the gas composition of air samples in caves according to depth is reported in table 1 and fig 3 during the high water condition march the proportion of o2 ne ar and n2 remains stable with depth with a concentration that is close to the atmospheric air reference fig 3 and table 1 in contrast the proportion of co2 increases from the atmospheric value at the ground surface 430 ppm to 2200 ppm at 120 m depth bise fig 3 during the low water condition september a greater co2 increase with depth was observed with co2 values almost doubled compared to high water from 2200 to 4200 ppm table 1 at the bise in the durzon spring catchment in the ironselle spring catchment the co2 values at 395 m depth during the low water condition reached up to 7400 ppm table 1 the fractions of o2 ne ar and n2 in air obtained at the different sampling points were similar to the atmospheric reference values for these gases we can conclude that the composition of the vadose zone air closely follows that of the atmosphere co2 seems to be produced in situ this case will be discussed in the section 5 2 1 gases transfer within the vadose zone o2 ne ar and n2 cannot inform about the potential time lag during transfers via the vadose zone due to their constant atmospheric concentrations over time therefore to investigate potential time lags during transfers the anthropogenic gases cfcs and sf6 were used the atmospheric concentrations of these gases have evolved since their industrial production in the 1950 s and are well described international atomic energy agency 2006 see table 2 distribution of cfcs in the atmosphere shows peaks of productions followed by a decrease iaea 2006 this peaked distribution in the atmosphere induces two possible date for one concentration for example cfc 11 and cfc 12 concentrations measured at the reynelle 9 m during high water conditions 237 pptv and 74 pptv respectively table 2 can be explained by recent air composition after 2010 or by ancient air composition around 1990 but if we look at the historical atmospheric distribution of sf6 it is in constant production so for a given concentration only one date exists the concentrations of sf6 therefore make it possible to distinguish between an air composition close to the present or older air for all measurements the sf6 concentrations vary between 9 2 1 0 and 10 1 3 pptv table 2 these concentrations uncertainties are close or higher to the air reference of the sampling year i e 9 37 pptv in 2018 and 9 7 pptv in 2019 indicating recent air signature the evolution of the gases cfcs and sf6 with depth from the surface to 120 m in the vadose zone shows slight variations from one depth to the other the cfc 11 concentration at 9 m reynelle is enriched at 237 pptv compared to the others measured at an average of 214 pptv table 2 but looking at the cfc 113 evolution along the vadose zone 74 pptv are measured at 9 m that is close to the surface concentration of 70 pptv the measured values of cfcs and sf6 with depth remains stable and close to the surface concentrations within the uncertainty fig 4 these results suggest that the air in caves of the vadose zone up to depths of 120 m has a cfcs and sf6 compositions close to the atmospheric air by the coupling of the several gases it seems that no time lag due to cfcs and sf6 diffusion through the conduits of the vadose zone need to be calculated finally apparent groundwater residence times can be calculated using the cfcs and sf6 atmospheric concentrations as the input data for the tracing 4 2 evolution of gaseous tracers along the vadose zone results in water samples ngt and ea were calculated from ne ar n2 measured in water samples for low water fig 5 red and high water fig 5 blue conditions table 3 the mean ngt obtained during the high water condition is 7 9 2 c with 0 007 χ² 0 6 while in low water condition the ngt calculated ranges from 18 5 c to 26 c 3 c with 2 2 χ² 4 4 the high ngt values during the low water condition are not consistent with the mean air temperature of the study area around 11 c to focus on the evolution of the recharge temperature along the vadose zone the ngt deviation from the sub surface point canalettes 5 m was calculated in fig 5 the evolution of the ngt deviation and water temperature evolution are compared water temperature increases from 9 c close to the surface 5 m to 10 7 c at 120 m and 11 1 c at the spring the water is heated during its circulation at depth by the effect of the geothermal flow whose average gradient of 3 c 100 m is shown in the fig 5 locally the causes of variation in geothermal flow are multiple and can come from the circulation of karstic water lismonde 2004 indeed high water flows tend to reduce the gradient temperature luetscher et jeannin 2004 the thermal gradient calculated from the low water data is evaluated at 1 c 100 m and from the high water data at 1 3 c 100 m which illustrate the attenuation of the geothermal flow the presence of a spring induces a movement of water that carries part of the heat flow from deep in the earth while the water temperature increases with depth the ngt remains stable during transfer along the vadose zone fig 5 for the evolution of the ea in the vadose zone during the high water condition the mean ea is 0 6 cm3stp kg in the unsaturated zone whilst at the spring the ea reaches up to 2 3 cm3stp kg fig 5 blue similar to the ngt absolute ea values calculated during the low water condition were underestimated inducing negative values fig 5 we thus used the ea deviation to follow the evolution along the vadose zone where we observe a slight increase and formation of ea during transfer along the vadose zone the historical ea data of the durzon spring 17 values from 2009 to 2013 shows very large variations during the hydrological cycle ranging from 0 3 cm3stp kg during high water conditions to 11 cm3stp kg during low water conditions sampling campaigns of 2018 and 2019 agreed with this historical ea evolution in spite of the underestimated low water ea value the highest values of ea measured at 120 m table 4 cannot explain the high ea value measured at the spring up to 10 7 cm3stp kg in july 2011 therefore an additional process contributing to the ea values has to be involved during groundwater flow in the saturated zone the evolution of anthropic dissolved gases cfc 12 vs sf6 is represented in fig 6 the samples from the high water condition are aligned according to depth and can be explained by a mixing line between actual water 2018 and an old end member sf6 measured at the spring during the high water condition show concentrations higher than the peak atmospheric concentration in 2018 therefore the spring cannot be represented on the cfc 12 vs sf6 diagram however the cfc 12 values of the spring between 408 and 412 pptv are closer to the shallower vadose zone rather than the deeper vadose zone values compared to the high water samples the low water samples have lower sf6 concentrations there is no correlation between depth and sf6 concentrations during the low water condition in addition the samples are better explained by a piston model in particular reynelles or by a piston exponential model where the exponential component varies between 10 and 50 fig 6 these observations will be addressed later in the paper 5 discussion 5 1 influence of degassing processes on dissolved gases the waters sampled during the low water condition in the vadose zone show low concentrations of noble gases an underestimation of the dissolved noble gas concentrations results in an overestimation of the recharge temperatures and leads to negative ea values calculated using the unfraction air ua model two hypotheses can explain this underestimation of dissolved gas concentrations 1 a problem occurred during the laboratory analysis or 2 a degassing phenomenon occurred during the transfer via the vadose zone of the karst degassing could explain why the ua model heaton and vogel 1981 that we used does not provide a good fit χ² between the observed data and the calculated values table 3 chi2 the partial re equilibration pr model stute et al 1995a 1995b was used as a diagnostic to test the second hypothesis as we used only three gases ne ar n2 the ngt was set at 11 c which corresponds to the annual mean air temperature in the catchment allowing us to add the fractionation coefficient f as a parameter to be set with the ea however the pr model did not reproduce the observations nor the positive ea values along the vadose zone a model taking into account degassing does not therefore seem to better explain the values measured during the low water condition this result is in good agreement with historical measured at the durzon spring since 2011 where no negative ea values were observed and for which the ua model well reproduced the ea and ngt values the analytical error is observed for all of the data for the same field campaign therefore the absolute values are not possible to use however the relative changes in the data deviation is valid and can be compared to relative changes from other field campaigns to conclude samples from the low water condition were also treated by the ua model and to avoid the analytical error the relative changes from the surface to the deeper area of the vadose zone were analysed 5 2 impact of the epikarst and the unsaturated zone on air and water transfers 5 2 1 gas transfer within the vadose zone the measurement of matrix air within the epikarst and at different depths in the unsaturated zone constitutes a real scientific challenge due to the complexity of the underground environment within the karst systems where accessibility and material input is not always possible the results of this study show that the air in the cavities of the vadose zone of the durzon catchment is in equilibrium with atmospheric air down to 120 m depth figs 2 and 3 only gaseous co2 increases with depth in the vadose zone and presents higher values in low water condition than in the high water condition the evolution of gaseous co2 between high water and low water conditions reflects the seasonal rhythm of the biomass with a higher production of co2 during summer paterson and sweeting 1986 batiot guilhe et al 2007 the co2 is thought to be of biogenic origin resulting from plant decomposition in the epikarst the gaseous co2 dissolved in the water is found in the form of carbonic acid h2co3 as the acidic water infiltrates deep into the ground via the seepage water it comes into contact with the limestone caco3 charging the water with calcium bicarbonate ca hco3 2 the water continues its journey to the depths of the subsoil and to the caves once in the voids of the underground environment calcium carbonate crystallises the caco3 crystals calcite accumulate and form the concretions in the cave releasing co2 into the cave air at the same time co2 is a heavy gas but its accumulation also depends on the geomorphology of the cave which allows more or less aeration batiot guilhe et al 2007 lopez 2009 for the durzon karstic system the dolomitic epikarst zone may include a perched aquifer plagnes 1997 fores et al 2017 the results of this study suggest that the perched aquifer located in the surface horizons of the vadose zone of the karst does not cause a disconnection between the air mass of the vadose zone and the atmosphere the gas results show that the epikarst must be seen as a very heterogeneous and discontinuous medium which allows both the storage of a volume of water perched aquifer but also the transfer of air along the vadose zone via sub vertical conduits some of which can be penetrated by speleologists up to 120 m deep cavities in the vadose zone of the karst are well aerated unlike porous media where a delay factor must be calculated to take into account gas diffusion busenberg and plummer 1992 cook and solomon 1995 oster et al 1996 zoellmann et al 2000 schwientek et al 2009 in karst environments despite the existence of a vadose zone of several tens or even hundreds of metres thick it is not necessary to calculate a gas delay or diffusion coefficients to consider the transfer of air to the saturated zone these results are nevertheless limited to the transmissive component of the karst i e the drains and cavities and cannot be generalised to the capacitive component represented by the porous matrix of the rock which was not analysed in this study 5 2 2 gas equilibrium using gaseous tracers in hydrosystems characterised by a perched aquifer epikarst located above a thick unsaturated zone raises important questions on gas equilibrium processes during transfers for example does the tracing start at the top of the vadose zone composed of a capacitive epikarst is there any equilibrium with the cave s air above or does the tracing start at the top of the saturated zone in this study at 120 m depth the air temperature is buffered at 10 8 c all year round at the durzon site high water sampling was carried out at the time of a snow recharge episode indicating a surface air temperature close to 0 c thus large variations in air temperature between the surface and the bottom of the vadose zone are suspected despite this no change of more than 3 c were observed in the ngt calculated from the dissolved gases fig 5 this stability in the ngt results around 8 2 c throughout the profile of the vadose zone indicates that there is no rebalancing of the dissolved gases in the water with the air in the cavities the results are similar in low water conditions confirming that noble gas equilibrium occurs in the near surface horizon at the epikarst during high water conditions according to the evolution of sf6 as a function of cfc 12 mixing is observed between the rapid infiltration of recent water from the surface and older water stored in the matrix porosity of the karst unsaturated zone fig 6 with increasing depth in the vadose zone the portion of recently infiltrated water decreases relative to the older pore matrix water therefore the surface horizons have greater volumes of more recent waters compared with the deeper horizons of the vadose zone which likely reflects transfer times within the vadose zone this difference in mixing as a function of depth also highlights the fact that there is no resetting of the equilibrium between water and air in the cavities during transfer along the vadose zone and similar to noble gas results the gas equilibrium occurs in the sub surface horizon concentrations of sf6 at the spring were unusable and so the graphic representation of the spring was not possible however from the cfc 12 concentrations it is evident that the spring was not aligned with samples from the vadose zone this non alignment can be explained by the mixing of groundwater from different flow pathways via both the unsaturated and saturated zones except for the spring value the signature of the saturated zone is unknown in the durzon catchment during low water conditions similar to the high water condition the water sampled at different depths of the vadose zone does not show a current atmospheric gas signature which indicates there is no equilibrium with the air in the cavities during the low water condition however no correlation with the vadose zone depth is observed different processes are involved in water transfers that are not dependent on depth during the low water condition the system is less likely subject to surface infiltration water flowing into the cavities during the low water condition can be assimilated to local springs draining the capacitive and water saturated zones of the vadose zone waters sampled from 5 m to 120 m are representative of the capacitive part of the karst and thus inform us on the matrix signal of the vadose zone this vadose zone can be locally disconnected from other parts of the vadose zone explaining the different gaseous signatures and are not necessarily correlated with depth each cave locally drains a part of the vadose whereas the spring incorporates the entire catchment area from the top of the vadose to the saturated zone understanding what governs flows along the vadose zone during low water conditions requires further work and is outside the scope of this paper 5 3 ea formation two main hypothesis are proposed in previous studies to explain the ea formation formation during the transfer along the vadose zone herzberg and mazor 1979 and or acquisition of the ea due to water level variations aeschbach hertig 2004 the evolution of ea suggests a slight increase of the signal during the transfer of water along the vadose zone 0 8 cm3 stp kg during high water condition fig 5 this enrichment in ea may be due to pressure variations within the vadose zone another hypothesis that could explain the enrichment of water in ea during its transfer along the vadose zone would be a flow that is sufficiently fast to cause air bubbles whose dissolution will be forced during a deep pressurisation herzberg and mazor 1979 however the ea values observed during low water and high water conditions at a depth of 120 m do not explain the maximum concentrations measured at the spring i e 11 cm3stp kg pers comm further work in the durzon catchment would be required to comment on the spatial representation of vadose zone results from this study relative to the whole catchment area nevertheless the significantly greater ea values of the spring compared with the vadose zone up to almost 5 times greater suggests that the formation of ea does not solely depend on the transfer along the vadose zone holocher et al 2002 experimentally investigated the formation of ea in near saturated porous media using vertical sand columns simulating variations of the water level he obtained a correlation between these variations and the measured ea between 0 14 and 1 62 cm3 stp kg for maximum variations of the piezometric level of one meter if variations in ea concentrations can be explained in part by the water table variations then ea could be used as a proxy to study the water table variations in addition ea could be useful to better understand the processes that take place between matrix and conduits having a chemical element to measure at the spring that informs about the water level variations can be useful when the saturated zone is not accessible by drilling located for example under a thick vadose zone 6 conclusion the use of dissolved gases as tracers in karstic aquifers renowned for their air cavities in thick unsaturated zones and epikarsts raises many questions relating to methods and applications the composition and impact of air in the subsurface where the dissolved gas equilibrium takes place along the vertical profile of the thick vadose zone and the conditions of ea formation are still debated in this research these questions were addressed by monitoring the evolution of noble and anthropogenic gases ne ar n2 cfc and sf6 in air and water along the vadose zone of the durzon and the ironselle catchments during two contrasted flow conditions low water and high water conditions the determination of the cave air composition and its comparison with the water concentrations show that at the durzon site 1 air in caves was in equilibrium with the atmospheric air up to 120 m deep 2 the presence of a capacitive epikarst does not disconnect the unsaturated zone from the atmosphere 3 the gas equilibrium appears to be achieved in a horizon close to the surface and then there is no gaseous re equilibrium between air and water with depth in the vadose zone 4 a small part of ea is formed during water transfer along the vadose zone but most of the ea observed at the spring is formed due to the water level variations of the saturated zone these observations indicate that there is no need to take into account a time lag coefficient associated with the gas dispersion into the unsaturated zone of a karst system this information is essential for the use of temporal gaseous tracers in karstic systems finally the strong link between ea and discharge suggests the development of ea as a tracer of recharge in karst aquifers therefore for karstic aquifers where the hydrodynamics are complex the ea provides a valuable tracer of variations in groundwater levels future work is required to integrate ea data into numerical models this integration of the gas results with hydrodynamic models would be useful to bring a new constraint to numerical models in karst systems future research is required to study the reaction of gas tracers in other lithologies such as limestone environments as observed in this study the formation of ea and therefore the reaction of gases is

4268,this study analyses the impact of a thick vadose zone on gaseous transfers and excess air ea formation using dissolved noble and anthropogenic gas tracers ne ar n2 cfc sf6 o2 and co2 understanding gas transfers integrates the issues of equilibrium and water air exchanges along the vadose zone in this study the noble and anthropogenic gases were analysed in air and water over vadose zone depths of 120 m and over two contrasted hydrodynamic periods therefore enabling a rare insight into the spatial and seasonal variations of equilibrium and water air exchanges in a heterogeneous karst environment the results highlight that both noble and anthropogenic gases of the caves are in equilibrium with the atmosphere up to at least depths of 120 m in water the noble gas temperature ngt remains stable at 8 c whilst some ea is formed up to 1 3 cm3 stp kg at 120 m during transfers in the vadose zone the high ea concentrations measured at the spring outlet until 10 7 cm3 stp kg cannot be explained by an increase during transfers via the vadose zone this high ea concentration is due to rapid and high water level variations during recharge the implications of these results are important to advance our understanding in the use of noble and anthropogenic gases in characterising recharge and quantifying groundwater residence times in particular these results help to identify the parts of the aquifer actively involved in dissolved gas transfers highlight the futility of using a time lag factor for groundwater residence times in karstic systems and improve our understanding of the ea formation processes keywords dissolved gases excess air ea karstic aquifers thick vadose zone gaseous transfers residence time gaseous tracers 1 introduction in karts systems the vadose zone composed of soil epikarst and the unsaturated zone stephens 1996 plays an important role in controlling the recharge processes of groundwater several methods exist to investigate transfers of water along the vadose zone and address the question of storage dynamics or travel time estimation of recharge water for example many studies of cave drips have been carried out and provide information on the storage capacity of the epikarst williams 1983 tooth and fairchild 2003 musgrove and banner 2004 fairchild et al 2006 garry et al 2008 arbel et al 2010 kluge et al 2010 poulain et al 2015 another approach is numerical modelling which has the advantage of being applicable on a large scale and over long time frames models based on physical processes and using richard s equations are applied to the porous vadose zone that can be assimilated to homogeneous aquifers vereecken et al 2008 these physically based approaches are interesting since they can deal with the degree of saturation of the vadose zone however they cannot take into account the heterogeneous properties of karst šimůnek et al 2003 which is why their application is scarce in karst aquifers globally karstic aquifers provide important groundwater resources e g bakalowicz 2005 stevanović 2018 2019 goldscheider et al 2020 however these aquifers are renowned for their heterogeneous structures including large voids conduits associated with a porous matrix that induce spatially heterogeneous hydrodynamic and hydrochemical properties bakalowicz 2008 this heterogeneity challenges the use of classical hydrogeological methods of investigation including the basic piezometric map to face these issues development of additional innovative methods is essential to investigate and provide an understanding of karst aquifer functioning especially within the vadose zone monitoring of the chemical composition of karstic systems is appropriate for investigating groundwater rock interactions origin and mixing of waters since chemical signatures are defined barnes and allison 1988 plagnes 1997 pinault et al 2001 perrin et al 2003 tooth and fairchild 2003 musgrove and banner 2004 aquilina et al 2005 carrasco et al 2006 fairchild et al 2006 kluge et al 2010 knierim et al 2013 kogovsek and petric 2014 sánchez et al 2015 however they fail to inform about physical processes such as air water equilibrium matrix conduits exchange and recharge conditions that affect water transfers from the surface to the spring in particular little is known of the temperature and pressure conditions during recharge even though such parameters can be critical in understanding hydrogeological processes dissolved gases are sensitive to recharge conditions as their solubility in water depends on recharge temperature salinity and pressure weiss 1970 1971 for noble gases since their partial pressure in the atmosphere remains stable their concentration in water only depends on the recharge conditions and especially temperature aeschbach hertig et al 1999 2000 manning and solomon 2003 ingram et al 2007 with inverse models noble gases have been used to determine the groundwater recharge temperature known as noble gas temperature ngt aeschbach hertig et al 1999 ballentine and hall 1999 which in turn can be used to infer information about the recharge period chatton et al 2016 moreover numerous studies have shown that the concentrations of dissolved noble gases in water can be higher than expected from the application of henry s law herzberg and mazor 1979 heaton and vogel 1981 stute et al 1995a 1995b this phenomenon is known as excess air ea it is usually taken into account as a corrective term of dissolved gas concentrations in the application of dating methods using gases tracers such as cfcs sf6 or he two assumptions have been made for ea formation firstly herzberg and mazor 1979 and mazor et al 1983 suggested that during water transfers along the vadose zone the air is sucked into the water in this case the concentration of ea is linked to the vadose zone thickness secondly stute and schlosser 2000 and aeschbach hertig 2004 explained that ea formation is via the entrapment of air bubbles after a rapid increase in the water table where the hydrostatic pressure increases during the water level change forces gas dissolution in this case concentrations of ea depend on water table fluctuations with higher values due to rapid and larger increases in the water table ingram et al 2007 massmann and sültenfuß 2008 in karst systems the vadose zones are often thick for example in the mediterranean area the vadose zone can be up to 400 m mudry and puig 1991 fleury et al 2007 moreover groundwater levels in karst aquifers can undergo rapid increases during recharge events several tens of meters e g bailly comte et al 2008 finally in karst systems the presence of an epikarst can often be associated with perched water tables klimchouk et al 2000 bakalowicz 2004 klimchouk 2004 such characteristics can significantly impact air water equilibrium gas transfers and ea formation despite this the composition and evolution of the dissolved gases in the vadose zones of karstic systems are poorly documented therefore the use of dissolved gases in karst systems raises the following fundamental questions relating to the processes of air water equilibrium i does the equilibrium occur at the surface of the epikarst or at the surface of the water table base of the vadose zone ii if the equilibrium occurs at the surface of the epikarst is the air in caves located at the bottom of a thick unsaturated zone still equilibrated with the atmospheric air and iii is there re equilibration during transfers along the thick vadose zone such questions are important for the application of dissolved gases as environmental tracers of recharge conditions and residence times in karst aquifers in particular the determination of the concentrations of cfcs and sf6 to be used for the calculation of water residence times may depend on the consideration of a time lag coefficient in the case of thick unsaturated zones the study of ea is also required to improve our understanding of links with the aquifer structure and or hydrodynamics and the quantification of groundwater residence times using gaseous dating tracers e g cfcs and sf6 to address these questions in this study the dissolved noble and anthropogenic gas tracers neon ne argon ar nitrogen n2 chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 were measured in both air and water at different depths along a thick vadose zone 120 m deep of a karst aquifer with a well developed epikarst this allowed us to identify the i air composition evolution along the vadose zone and its equilibrium with the atmosphere ii gas evolution in air and in water to identify the equilibrium depth for dissolution of gases and iii mechanisms of ea formation in a karstic system 2 study area the area of investigation is located in a jurassic carbonate plateau of the causse du larzac south of france and has an elevation between 700 and 900 m asl this site is part of the natural regional park

and limestone of the early jurassic and ii the middle to upper jurassic these two carbonate series are separated by the toarcian marls that outcrop at the hospitalet s fault which constrains the emergence of the durzon s spring at the base of the middle jurassic carbonates fig 1 a the climate of the causse du larzac is mediterranean defined by wet winter and spring months until a monthly average of 8 mm calculated for the 2007 2019 period and a dry summer monthly average less than 2 mm calculated for the 2007 2019 period autumn is characterised by intense rainfall events caused by cevenol episodes with rainfall peaks that can reach up to 290 mm day fig 1 this period constitutes an important recharge period for the aquifer in this study we refer to high and low water conditions to define two states observed during the hydrological cycle the high water condition results from the autumn winter and spring rainfall recharge and is characterised by high spring flow and groundwater levels towards the beginning of the dry season the low water condition is mainly during the dry season when the spring flow and groundwater levels are lower the mean potential evapotranspiration is 2 5 mm day with a maximum value of 9 mm day during summer fig 1 the air temperature is between 14 c and 35 c with an average of 11 c during recharge periods of spring and autumn

estimated by dye tracing ricard and bakalowicz 1996 fores 2016 fig 2 a the aquifer is unconfined in the two blocks located on each side of the hospitalet fault the saturated zone is developed within the middle jurassic dolomite in the southern region and both within the middle jurassic dolomite and the middle jurassic limestone to the north of the hospitalet fault the durzon spring is the main spring that drains the catchment and therefore represents catchment scale hydrodynamic and hydrogeochemical information the durzon system is characterised by a thick vadose zone up to 120 m deep south of the hospitalet s fault and an epikarst developed in the dolomite weathered to dolomitic sands especially in the southern part of the catchment this lithology allows an important storage of water in the near surface one manifestation of this storage is the formation of temporary lakes mainly located south of the catchment that were last filled in 2014 fores 2016 these changes in geology vadose zone depths and epikarst thicknesses results in heterogeneous hydraulic properties of the vadose zone between the southern and the northern regions of the durzon spring catchment water storage in the vadose zone of the study area has previously been investigated through the use of several geophysical methods that couple gravimetry and seismology with hydrology these studies confirmed the important role of the epikarst for vadose zone water storage jacob 2009 deville 2013 in addition the fluxes from the epikarst were modeled based on continuous gravimetric measurements site of la jasse the larzac observatory the results showed that this flow can correspond to the spring s base flow fores et al 2017 from this conceptual model of the durzon the storage compartment of the system is only referred to the epikarst located at the top of the aquifer and no reference to the saturated zone located at the bottom is made several accessible caves in the vadose zone are present in the southern area of the hospitalet s fault the bise cave reaches a depth of 120 m from the grounds surface and there is a stream that flows through the cave that is disconnected from the saturated zone based on the analysis of the durzon spring recession curves the karst system shows an average dynamic volume of 72 mm3 22 mm3 mangin 1975 which highlights the presence of large groundwater reserves at the site plagnes 1997 chemical variations are low during seasonal hydrological changes except for a rapid increase until 40 µs cm in the specific conductivity spc and a decrease in the mg2 concentrations that result from the fast infiltration after recharge events plagnes 1997 high values of mg2 mean value 18 9 mg l concentrations are correlated to the extension of the ruiniform dolomites from the bathonian at the surface of the catchment estimated at 81 7 km2 plagnes 1997 another catchment has been used the ironselle catchment located on the nearby causse méjean 25 km north of the durzon spring and developed in the same geological and climatic context as the durzon spring catchment it presents a comparable structure of a carbonate plateau developed in dolomites and limestone from the jurassic but has a thicker vadose zone than the durzon s catchment allowing a deeper sampling at 395 m depth the only site sampled on this catchment 44 16 20 n 3 16 34 e wsg 84 3 methods 3 1 dataset

dissolved gas samples for cfc 12 sf6 ne ar and n2 analysis have been collected at the durzon spring from 2009 to 2019 with a monthly time step between february 2010 and november 2011 de montety et al 2012 these measurements of gases in the spring were compared with the data obtained in the vadose zone at different stages of the hydrological cycle to determine whether the vadose zone data can partly or fully explain the spring data the catchment is composed of many caves that allow caving activities in some of them water is found in tanks or as underground stream that allow the sample of water the air of the cave can also be sampled so air and water are sampled at different depth along the vadose zone fig 2 b four locations shown in fig 2 a with contrasted depths have been sampled to describe both the epikarstic and vadose zone canalettes and reynelles at 5 and 9 m depth respectively for the epikarstic zone a 45 m deep borehole in the unsaturated zone jasse and an underground river at 120 m depth in the unsaturated zone bise in addition air was sampled at the land s surface 700 m a s l and water was also sampled at the durzon spring two sampling campaigns were undertaken during high and low water conditions march 2018 and sept 2019 respectively to evaluate the seasonal hydrological influence on the gas transfers rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data used in this study are collected by météo france on le caylar station located 14 km south of the site providing daily data since 2004 air temperature is monitored by a flux tower with a precision of 0 1 c located on the catchment the air temperature in the cave of la bise is buffered to 10 8 c all year round pers comm the water level is also monitored in the vadose zone since 2013 in two boreholes of 20 and 51 m depth located on the la jasse site fig 2 a and equipped with a sws ctd diver since 2013 to complement the durzon spring data samples were also collected during the low water condition in a similar karstic catchment the ironselle catchment air samples were collected at 395 m depths in the cheminée cave at the ironselle catchment 3 2 sampling and analysis air samples for noble gas analysis were collected by filling 130 ml glass bottles sealed with rubber caps using syringes the air volume of the bottle was renewed 3 times before sampling with a slight overpressure to avoid later contamination from atmospheric air dissolved noble gases in water were collected in 500 ml glass bottles closed with rubber caps and sealed by a metal ring a small submergable pump mini twister 12 v standard pvc sdec france was used to sample the ironselle spring and the cave waters at the canalettes 5 m depth a peristaltic pump was required due to the very low flow rate sampling was done directly in the cavity where the basin was located so the pump and the tank containing the water were at the same altitude in order to avoid any pressure losses and therefore any decompressions in the pump for the jasse borehole 45 m depth and the durzon spring a grundfos mp1 pump was used samples were collected under water directly in the groundwater or in a bucket to avoid any air contamination after having renewed the water 3 times two or three replicates were collected for each sampling point cfc and sf6 water samples were collected without atmospheric contact in stainless steel ampoules of 40 ml cfc and 300 ml sf6 closed with two stainless steel three way valves in addition for each dissolved gas sample physico chemical parameters t c ph spc and dissolved oxygen do were recorded using a portable multimeter hq40d hach only the groundwater temperature at the jasse borehole was measured by the ctd diver located in the borehole rather than at the land s surface with the portable multimeter hq40d hach both air and water samples were analysed at the condate eau analytical platform university of rennes by gas chromatography analysis for water sample analyses ne ar n2 were extracted by head space and measured by gas chromatography using a catharometer detector µgc 3000 sra with a precision of 8 for ne and 5 for ar and n2 cfcs and sf6 were extracted by the purge and trap method to concentrate the gases and quantified by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector labasque et al 2014 2006 the analyses are within a precision of 3 for cfc 12 and 5 for sf6 in water for air samples excluding the extraction of gases from the liquid phase the analytical process was the same as for water samples the precision repeatability is about 10 mainly due to the low pressure of air samples and then possible contaminations air has been sampled at the surface of the catchment march 2018 high water campaign and in the analysis laboratory september 2019 low water campaign for the calibration every air sample was corrected from this calibration 3 3 calculation of recharge conditions ngt and ea ne ar and n2 can be used to estimate noble gas temperature ngt and excess air ea e g heaton and vogel 1981 plummer et al 2004 chatton et al 2016 n2 is a major gas which can be produced by biological reactions such as denitrification in anoxic systems blicher mathiesen et al 1998 mariotti 1986 smith et al 1991 however in karst systems anoxic conditions are rarely found especially in an unconfined reservoir for the durzon system the dissolved oxygen do is always above 7 6 mg l for this reason the n2 dissolved concentration was assumed to remain stable during the hydrological cycle and was used to deduce ngt and ea calculations were performed using the unfraction air ua conceptual model following the methodology described by aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 this simple model does not include degassing or gas partitioning according to this model the concentration of the dissolved gas i is given by 1 c i t s p ea ua c i t s p ea ua z i where eaua is the concentration of dissolved dry air in water zi the volume fraction of the gas i in dry air corresponding to xi the molar fraction and ci is the moist air solubility equilibrium concentration at the given recharge temperature t k salinity s and pressure p atm heaton and vogel 1981 an inverse approach aeschbach hertig et al 1999 manning and solomon 2003 was also applied where the model calculates the gas concentrations mol l by applying henry s law for varying ngt and ea parameters the best set of ngt and ea was obtained after minimization of the χ2 function using the following equations 2 x 2 c i measured ci calculated 2 σ 2 with 3 ci calculated β i 22 4 x i p p h 2 o x i v m e a

salinity the salinity of groundwater from the durzon and ironselle aquifers is low 0 5 therefore the salinity correction can be neglected and fixed at 0 aeschbach hertig et al 2000 1999 andrews and

approach 100 random concentrations are drawn for each gas based on a normal distribution centred on the measured value and within the range of the analytical error then 100 sets of parameters are calculated the uncertainty of ngt and ea was given by the standard deviation of these 100 simulations the gas result corresponds to the mean value of the replicate samples collected at each point we compared the results from our method of calculation using three gases to the results from the use of five noble gases using the work from holocher et al 2002 this comparison shows that the accuracy of the ngt and the ea is more dependent on the analytical uncertainties than the number of gases used for the calculation the use of ar and ne is sufficient to determine ngt and ea as argon dissolution is sensitive to temperature while neon dissolution is sensitive to excess air 3 4 calculation of cfc 12 and sf6 atmospheric pressures determination of groundwater residence times and flow models relies on the calculation of atmospheric mixing ratio pptv using henry s law international atomic energy agency 2006 the influence of the recharge elevation is small for elevations less than 1000 m international atomic energy agency 2006 the durzon karst system is located in a plateau so its elevation does not vary much between 700 and 900 m 200 m of variation induces less than 1 c and 0 2 cm3 stp kg of uncertainties on the ngt and ea parameters respectively so it has been fixed to 700 m asl in this study in contrast recharge temperature is an essential parameter to calculate the coefficient of solubility βi the annual air temperature can be assumed to be close to the recharge temperature herzberg and mazor 1979 however air temperature data representative of the recharge sites is not always available or known therefore another approach is to calculate the recharge temperature based on the water ngt international atomic energy agency 2006 chatton et al 2016 de montety et al 2012 in this study we used the ngt as we generally sampled noble gases and anthropogenic gases at the same time however we noticed some analytical problems for the dissolved noble gases sampled in september 2019 low water condition limiting their use for estimating the ngt for this campaign therefore the mean ngt 9 1 c 2 2 c calculated during low water conditions at the durzon spring between 2009 and 2013 6 values was used the same procedure was applied for ea computation which is an essential corrective term especially for sf6 values 4 results 4 1 evolution of gaseous tracers along the vadose zone results in air samples the gas composition of air samples in caves according to depth is reported in table 1 and fig 3 during the high water condition march the proportion of o2 ne ar and n2 remains stable with depth with a concentration that is close to the atmospheric air reference fig 3 and table 1 in contrast the proportion of co2 increases from the atmospheric value at the ground surface 430 ppm to 2200 ppm at 120 m depth bise fig 3 during the low water condition september a greater co2 increase with depth was observed with co2 values almost doubled compared to high water from 2200 to 4200 ppm table 1 at the bise in the durzon spring catchment in the ironselle spring catchment the co2 values at 395 m depth during the low water condition reached up to 7400 ppm table 1 the fractions of o2 ne ar and n2 in air obtained at the different sampling points were similar to the atmospheric reference values for these gases we can conclude that the composition of the vadose zone air closely follows that of the atmosphere co2 seems to be produced in situ this case will be discussed in the section 5 2 1 gases transfer within the vadose zone o2 ne ar and n2 cannot inform about the potential time lag during transfers via the vadose zone due to their constant atmospheric concentrations over time therefore to investigate potential time lags during transfers the anthropogenic gases cfcs and sf6 were used the atmospheric concentrations of these gases have evolved since their industrial production in the 1950 s and are well described international atomic energy agency 2006 see table 2 distribution of cfcs in the atmosphere shows peaks of productions followed by a decrease iaea 2006 this peaked distribution in the atmosphere induces two possible date for one concentration for example cfc 11 and cfc 12 concentrations measured at the reynelle 9 m during high water conditions 237 pptv and 74 pptv respectively table 2 can be explained by recent air composition after 2010 or by ancient air composition around 1990 but if we look at the historical atmospheric distribution of sf6 it is in constant production so for a given concentration only one date exists the concentrations of sf6 therefore make it possible to distinguish between an air composition close to the present or older air for all measurements the sf6 concentrations vary between 9 2 1 0 and 10 1 3 pptv table 2 these concentrations uncertainties are close or higher to the air reference of the sampling year i e 9 37 pptv in 2018 and 9 7 pptv in 2019 indicating recent air signature the evolution of the gases cfcs and sf6 with depth from the surface to 120 m in the vadose zone shows slight variations from one depth to the other the cfc 11 concentration at 9 m reynelle is enriched at 237 pptv compared to the others measured at an average of 214 pptv table 2 but looking at the cfc 113 evolution along the vadose zone 74 pptv are measured at 9 m that is close to the surface concentration of 70 pptv the measured values of cfcs and sf6 with depth remains stable and close to the surface concentrations within the uncertainty fig 4 these results suggest that the air in caves of the vadose zone up to depths of 120 m has a cfcs and sf6 compositions close to the atmospheric air by the coupling of the several gases it seems that no time lag due to cfcs and sf6 diffusion through the conduits of the vadose zone need to be calculated finally apparent groundwater residence times can be calculated using the cfcs and sf6 atmospheric concentrations as the input data for the tracing 4 2 evolution of gaseous tracers along the vadose zone results in water samples ngt and ea were calculated from ne ar n2 measured in water samples for low water fig 5 red and high water fig 5 blue conditions table 3 the mean ngt obtained during the high water condition is 7 9 2 c with 0 007 χ² 0 6 while in low water condition the ngt calculated ranges from 18 5 c to 26 c 3 c with 2 2 χ² 4 4 the high ngt values during the low water condition are not consistent with the mean air temperature of the study area around 11 c to focus on the evolution of the recharge temperature along the vadose zone the ngt deviation from the sub surface point canalettes 5 m was calculated in fig 5 the evolution of the ngt deviation and water temperature evolution are compared water temperature increases from 9 c close to the surface 5 m to 10 7 c at 120 m and 11 1 c at the spring the water is heated during its circulation at depth by the effect of the geothermal flow whose average gradient of 3 c 100 m is shown in the fig 5 locally the causes of variation in geothermal flow are multiple and can come from the circulation of karstic water lismonde 2004 indeed high water flows tend to reduce the gradient temperature luetscher et jeannin 2004 the thermal gradient calculated from the low water data is evaluated at 1 c 100 m and from the high water data at 1 3 c 100 m which illustrate the attenuation of the geothermal flow the presence of a spring induces a movement of water that carries part of the heat flow from deep in the earth while the water temperature increases with depth the ngt remains stable during transfer along the vadose zone fig 5 for the evolution of the ea in the vadose zone during the high water condition the mean ea is 0 6 cm3stp kg in the unsaturated zone whilst at the spring the ea reaches up to 2 3 cm3stp kg fig 5 blue similar to the ngt absolute ea values calculated during the low water condition were underestimated inducing negative values fig 5 we thus used the ea deviation to follow the evolution along the vadose zone where we observe a slight increase and formation of ea during transfer along the vadose zone the historical ea data of the durzon spring 17 values from 2009 to 2013 shows very large variations during the hydrological cycle ranging from 0 3 cm3stp kg during high water conditions to 11 cm3stp kg during low water conditions sampling campaigns of 2018 and 2019 agreed with this historical ea evolution in spite of the underestimated low water ea value the highest values of ea measured at 120 m table 4 cannot explain the high ea value measured at the spring up to 10 7 cm3stp kg in july 2011 therefore an additional process contributing to the ea values has to be involved during groundwater flow in the saturated zone the evolution of anthropic dissolved gases cfc 12 vs sf6 is represented in fig 6 the samples from the high water condition are aligned according to depth and can be explained by a mixing line between actual water 2018 and an old end member sf6 measured at the spring during the high water condition show concentrations higher than the peak atmospheric concentration in 2018 therefore the spring cannot be represented on the cfc 12 vs sf6 diagram however the cfc 12 values of the spring between 408 and 412 pptv are closer to the shallower vadose zone rather than the deeper vadose zone values compared to the high water samples the low water samples have lower sf6 concentrations there is no correlation between depth and sf6 concentrations during the low water condition in addition the samples are better explained by a piston model in particular reynelles or by a piston exponential model where the exponential component varies between 10 and 50 fig 6 these observations will be addressed later in the paper 5 discussion 5 1 influence of degassing processes on dissolved gases the waters sampled during the low water condition in the vadose zone show low concentrations of noble gases an underestimation of the dissolved noble gas concentrations results in an overestimation of the recharge temperatures and leads to negative ea values calculated using the unfraction air ua model two hypotheses can explain this underestimation of dissolved gas concentrations 1 a problem occurred during the laboratory analysis or 2 a degassing phenomenon occurred during the transfer via the vadose zone of the karst degassing could explain why the ua model heaton and vogel 1981 that we used does not provide a good fit χ² between the observed data and the calculated values table 3 chi2 the partial re equilibration pr model stute et al 1995a 1995b was used as a diagnostic to test the second hypothesis as we used only three gases ne ar n2 the ngt was set at 11 c which corresponds to the annual mean air temperature in the catchment allowing us to add the fractionation coefficient f as a parameter to be set with the ea however the pr model did not reproduce the observations nor the positive ea values along the vadose zone a model taking into account degassing does not therefore seem to better explain the values measured during the low water condition this result is in good agreement with historical measured at the durzon spring since 2011 where no negative ea values were observed and for which the ua model well reproduced the ea and ngt values the analytical error is observed for all of the data for the same field campaign therefore the absolute values are not possible to use however the relative changes in the data deviation is valid and can be compared to relative changes from other field campaigns to conclude samples from the low water condition were also treated by the ua model and to avoid the analytical error the relative changes from the surface to the deeper area of the vadose zone were analysed 5 2 impact of the epikarst and the unsaturated zone on air and water transfers 5 2 1 gas transfer within the vadose zone the measurement of matrix air within the epikarst and at different depths in the unsaturated zone constitutes a real scientific challenge due to the complexity of the underground environment within the karst systems where accessibility and material input is not always possible the results of this study show that the air in the cavities of the vadose zone of the durzon catchment is in equilibrium with atmospheric air down to 120 m depth figs 2 and 3 only gaseous co2 increases with depth in the vadose zone and presents higher values in low water condition than in the high water condition the evolution of gaseous co2 between high water and low water conditions reflects the seasonal rhythm of the biomass with a higher production of co2 during summer paterson and sweeting 1986 batiot guilhe et al 2007 the co2 is thought to be of biogenic origin resulting from plant decomposition in the epikarst the gaseous co2 dissolved in the water is found in the form of carbonic acid h2co3 as the acidic water infiltrates deep into the ground via the seepage water it comes into contact with the limestone caco3 charging the water with calcium bicarbonate ca hco3 2 the water continues its journey to the depths of the subsoil and to the caves once in the voids of the underground environment calcium carbonate crystallises the caco3 crystals calcite accumulate and form the concretions in the cave releasing co2 into the cave air at the same time co2 is a heavy gas but its accumulation also depends on the geomorphology of the cave which allows more or less aeration batiot guilhe et al 2007 lopez 2009 for the durzon karstic system the dolomitic epikarst zone may include a perched aquifer plagnes 1997 fores et al 2017 the results of this study suggest that the perched aquifer located in the surface horizons of the vadose zone of the karst does not cause a disconnection between the air mass of the vadose zone and the atmosphere the gas results show that the epikarst must be seen as a very heterogeneous and discontinuous medium which allows both the storage of a volume of water perched aquifer but also the transfer of air along the vadose zone via sub vertical conduits some of which can be penetrated by speleologists up to 120 m deep cavities in the vadose zone of the karst are well aerated unlike porous media where a delay factor must be calculated to take into account gas diffusion busenberg and plummer 1992 cook and solomon 1995 oster et al 1996 zoellmann et al 2000 schwientek et al 2009 in karst environments despite the existence of a vadose zone of several tens or even hundreds of metres thick it is not necessary to calculate a gas delay or diffusion coefficients to consider the transfer of air to the saturated zone these results are nevertheless limited to the transmissive component of the karst i e the drains and cavities and cannot be generalised to the capacitive component represented by the porous matrix of the rock which was not analysed in this study 5 2 2 gas equilibrium using gaseous tracers in hydrosystems characterised by a perched aquifer epikarst located above a thick unsaturated zone raises important questions on gas equilibrium processes during transfers for example does the tracing start at the top of the vadose zone composed of a capacitive epikarst is there any equilibrium with the cave s air above or does the tracing start at the top of the saturated zone in this study at 120 m depth the air temperature is buffered at 10 8 c all year round at the durzon site high water sampling was carried out at the time of a snow recharge episode indicating a surface air temperature close to 0 c thus large variations in air temperature between the surface and the bottom of the vadose zone are suspected despite this no change of more than 3 c were observed in the ngt calculated from the dissolved gases fig 5 this stability in the ngt results around 8 2 c throughout the profile of the vadose zone indicates that there is no rebalancing of the dissolved gases in the water with the air in the cavities the results are similar in low water conditions confirming that noble gas equilibrium occurs in the near surface horizon at the epikarst during high water conditions according to the evolution of sf6 as a function of cfc 12 mixing is observed between the rapid infiltration of recent water from the surface and older water stored in the matrix porosity of the karst unsaturated zone fig 6 with increasing depth in the vadose zone the portion of recently infiltrated water decreases relative to the older pore matrix water therefore the surface horizons have greater volumes of more recent waters compared with the deeper horizons of the vadose zone which likely reflects transfer times within the vadose zone this difference in mixing as a function of depth also highlights the fact that there is no resetting of the equilibrium between water and air in the cavities during transfer along the vadose zone and similar to noble gas results the gas equilibrium occurs in the sub surface horizon concentrations of sf6 at the spring were unusable and so the graphic representation of the spring was not possible however from the cfc 12 concentrations it is evident that the spring was not aligned with samples from the vadose zone this non alignment can be explained by the mixing of groundwater from different flow pathways via both the unsaturated and saturated zones except for the spring value the signature of the saturated zone is unknown in the durzon catchment during low water conditions similar to the high water condition the water sampled at different depths of the vadose zone does not show a current atmospheric gas signature which indicates there is no equilibrium with the air in the cavities during the low water condition however no correlation with the vadose zone depth is observed different processes are involved in water transfers that are not dependent on depth during the low water condition the system is less likely subject to surface infiltration water flowing into the cavities during the low water condition can be assimilated to local springs draining the capacitive and water saturated zones of the vadose zone waters sampled from 5 m to 120 m are representative of the capacitive part of the karst and thus inform us on the matrix signal of the vadose zone this vadose zone can be locally disconnected from other parts of the vadose zone explaining the different gaseous signatures and are not necessarily correlated with depth each cave locally drains a part of the vadose whereas the spring incorporates the entire catchment area from the top of the vadose to the saturated zone understanding what governs flows along the vadose zone during low water conditions requires further work and is outside the scope of this paper 5 3 ea formation two main hypothesis are proposed in previous studies to explain the ea formation formation during the transfer along the vadose zone herzberg and mazor 1979 and or acquisition of the ea due to water level variations aeschbach hertig 2004 the evolution of ea suggests a slight increase of the signal during the transfer of water along the vadose zone 0 8 cm3 stp kg during high water condition fig 5 this enrichment in ea may be due to pressure variations within the vadose zone another hypothesis that could explain the enrichment of water in ea during its transfer along the vadose zone would be a flow that is sufficiently fast to cause air bubbles whose dissolution will be forced during a deep pressurisation herzberg and mazor 1979 however the ea values observed during low water and high water conditions at a depth of 120 m do not explain the maximum concentrations measured at the spring i e 11 cm3stp kg pers comm further work in the durzon catchment would be required to comment on the spatial representation of vadose zone results from this study relative to the whole catchment area nevertheless the significantly greater ea values of the spring compared with the vadose zone up to almost 5 times greater suggests that the formation of ea does not solely depend on the transfer along the vadose zone holocher et al 2002 experimentally investigated the formation of ea in near saturated porous media using vertical sand columns simulating variations of the water level he obtained a correlation between these variations and the measured ea between 0 14 and 1 62 cm3 stp kg for maximum variations of the piezometric level of one meter if variations in ea concentrations can be explained in part by the water table variations then ea could be used as a proxy to study the water table variations in addition ea could be useful to better understand the processes that take place between matrix and conduits having a chemical element to measure at the spring that informs about the water level variations can be useful when the saturated zone is not accessible by drilling located for example under a thick vadose zone 6 conclusion the use of dissolved gases as tracers in karstic aquifers renowned for their air cavities in thick unsaturated zones and epikarsts raises many questions relating to methods and applications the composition and impact of air in the subsurface where the dissolved gas equilibrium takes place along the vertical profile of the thick vadose zone and the conditions of ea formation are still debated in this research these questions were addressed by monitoring the evolution of noble and anthropogenic gases ne ar n2 cfc and sf6 in air and water along the vadose zone of the durzon and the ironselle catchments during two contrasted flow conditions low water and high water conditions the determination of the cave air composition and its comparison with the water concentrations show that at the durzon site 1 air in caves was in equilibrium with the atmospheric air up to 120 m deep 2 the presence of a capacitive epikarst does not disconnect the unsaturated zone from the atmosphere 3 the gas equilibrium appears to be achieved in a horizon close to the surface and then there is no gaseous re equilibrium between air and water with depth in the vadose zone 4 a small part of ea is formed during water transfer along the vadose zone but most of the ea observed at the spring is formed due to the water level variations of the saturated zone these observations indicate that there is no need to take into account a time lag coefficient associated with the gas dispersion into the unsaturated zone of a karst system this information is essential for the use of temporal gaseous tracers in karstic systems finally the strong link between ea and discharge suggests the development of ea as a tracer of recharge in karst aquifers therefore for karstic aquifers where the hydrodynamics are complex the ea provides a valuable tracer of variations in groundwater levels future work is required to integrate ea data into numerical models this integration of the gas results with hydrodynamic models would be useful to bring a new constraint to numerical models in karst systems future research is required to study the reaction of gas tracers in other lithologies such as limestone environments as observed in this study the formation of ea and therefore the reaction of gases is strongly linked to the karstic aquifer structures credit authorship contribution statement laïna pérotin conceptualization software formal analysis investigation writing original draft project

4269,due to polar amplification of climate change high latitudes are warming up twice as fast as the rest of the world this warming leads to permafrost thawing which increases the thickness of the overlying active layer and modifies the subsurface hydrologic regime of the draining watershed therefore affecting baseflow to surface water and modifying recession characteristics the active layer thickening and the subsurface flow modification are assumed to be linearly correlated the objective of this study is to test this assumption by quantifying the correlation between the temporal evolution of hydrologic parameters recession slope and initial recession outflow and 11 controlling factors all linked to surface subsurface and climatic conditions for 336 arctic catchments from 1970 to 2000 contrary to previous studies we demonstrate a clear decrease in recession slope and initial recession outflow over 1970 2000 for a majority of catchments at any significance level we explain this result by identifying high topography and low permafrost extent as controlling factors that complexify the relationship between trends in recession parameters and active layer thickness evolution the study goes further by identifying the mechanisms behind the complexification of the relationship permafrost extent loss hydrologic connectivity increase flow path diversity increase contributing drainage area multiplication the novel aspect of the study lay behind the large number of studied catchments and the large range of controlling factors tested keywords arctic hydrology large scale recession analysis thawing permafrost active layer thickening 1 introduction permafrost is defined as soil or rock that remains at or below 0 c for at least two consecutive years french 2018 the active layer is a superficial seasonally frozen layer located above permafrost because it is susceptible to air temperature variations the active layer freezes in winter and thaws in summer the thickness of the active layer rarely exceeds a few meters while that of the permafrost can reach hundreds of meters permafrost acts as an impermeable barrier and groundwater flow in permafrost regions is limited to unfrozen zones that may exist above supra permafrost also equivalent to the active layer beneath sub permafrost or within intra permafrost permafrost in arctic regions permafrost is thawing as a result of climate warming the circumpolar active layer monitoring calm program which monitors the evolution of the active layer of 100 northern high latitude sites has shown deeper thaw penetration and increased active layer thickness over the last decades brown et al 2000 during the same period the minimum and total discharges of rivers in high latitude catchments have increased smith et al 2007 rood et al 2017 baseflow has increased walvoord and striegl 2007 groundwater flow paths have become longer and deeper bense et al 2009 and the vertical hydraulic connectivity in the subsurface has increased walvoord et al 2012 because the active layer can represent a local aquifer its thickening caused by permafrost thawing also increases groundwater flow which in turn increases baseflow to rivers the hydrological signature of a river is characterized among other factors by its recession constant α and initial recession outflow q0 in theory an increased active layer thickness caused by permafrost thawing should lead to increases in recession constant and initial recession outflow previous studies lyon et al 2009 brutsaert and hiyama 2012 tested this theoretical relationship with recession flow analysis based on the 1d boussinesq equation their aim was to quantify rates of permafrost thawing from the recession flow analysis studies that used the same approach analyzed a limited number of catchments lyon and destouni 2010 sjöberg et al 2013 ploum et al 2019 and revealed the complexity in the interpretation of results evans et al 2020 hinzman et al 2020 to understand the subsurface behavior of catchments exposed to extreme cold temperatures and freeze thaw cycles the sole river hydrological signature cannot thoroughly reflect the dynamics of the underlying active layer other factors should be taken into account to better describe groundwater and surface water interactions in arctic regions for example evans et al 2020 included permafrost extent in their analysis however recent findings indicate that climatic conditions might also modify the storage discharge relationships hinzman et al 2020 our study generalizes previous results by expanding the recession flow analysis to 336 heterogeneous arctic catchments and by testing the influence of 11 controlling factors the selected controlling factors are grouped whether they are associated to the surface subsurface or climate factors associated with the surface include vegetation snow cover and topography factors associated with the subsurface include permafrost distribution soil properties and carbon storage factors related to climate include air temperature and precipitation the primary objectives of this study are to 1 determine the evolution of the recession constant α and the initial recession outflow q0 with climate warming over the 1970 2000 period 2 analyze how trends for α and q0 statistically vary with surface subsurface and climatic factors and 3 determine the role of surface subsurface and climatic factors as controls for the relationship between the active layer thickness and α and q0 2 presentation of the study area and data 2 1 catchment selection daily discharge m3 s time series from 336 unregulated catchments that belong to the pan arctic drainage basin were analyzed the time series originated from four data providers global runoff data centre n 131 water survey of canada n 134 r arcticnet n 60 and swedish meteorological and hydrological institute n 11 they span at least 25 years over the 30 year period between 1970 and 2000 for catchments located between latitudes 47 and 70 the median is 57 and whose drainage areas range from 6 to 50 000 km2 the median is 3000 km2 the location and area size were chosen to maximize the number of catchments and length of the time series the upper limit of 50 000 km2 for the drainage area was chosen i to ensure somewhat homogeneous environmental characteristics such as vegetation and snow cover soil conditions and precipitation for each catchment and ii to limit potential distortions resulting from the diversity in the hydrological signature of nested catchments using a common reference period of thirty years 1970 2000 which is consistent with the period used for impact studies of climate change enables comparison between catchments while eliminating discrepancies that could be related to the characteristics of the selected time period 2 2 catchment environmental conditions previous studies have shown that a range of key factors impact the active layer dynamics and or the hydrological behavior of catchments these factors include permafrost extent evans et al 2020 vegetation bring et al 2016 prowse et al 2015 topography bring et al 2016 o connor et al 2019 snow cover park et al 2013 carbon content of the soil o connor et al 2019 drainable porosity smith et al 2007 hydraulic conductivity ploum et al 2019 jacques and sauchyn 2009 precipitation pavelsky and smith 2006 karlsson et al 2015 rawlins et al 2009 and temperature karlsson et al 2015 based on these studies 11 controlling factors were calculated and assigned to each catchment 1 vegetation height

soc in kg c m 2 8 drainable porosity nd 9 soil saturated hydraulic conductivity logk with k in m s 10 annual precipitation increase over the time period δp in mm yr and 11 annual temperature increase over the time period δt in c yr a map of terrestrial ecoregions was obtained from olson et al 2001 and spatially intersected with each of the 336 catchments each catchment was assigned a single ecoregion type that corresponds to its predominant type olson et al 2001 defined fourteen major ecoregion types to reflect terrestrial biodiversity five of these ecoregions are represented in our dataset 1 tundra arctic 2 temperate grasslands savannas and shrublands temperate semiarid 3 boreal forests taiga subarctic humid 4 temperate broadleaf and mixed forests temperate humid and 5 temperate coniferous forests temperate humid to semi humid ranging from the shortest of tundra types to the highest forest conditions to represent these five ecoregion types factor veg was assigned numerical values that range from 1 to 5 with the value increasing for increasing relative vegetation height fig 1 we also extracted the topography for each catchment from olson et al 2001 and assigned to factor topo a value equal to 1 for boreal plains and a value equal to 1 for mountains estimated soil organic carbon storage values soc in kg c m 2 at a depth of 300 cm were obtained from hugelius et al 2013 and were averaged over each catchment they were available for 286 catchments fig 1 the soil hydraulic properties for each catchment were derived from montzka et al 2017 they include the saturated hydraulic conductivity k in m s at a depth of 200 cm and the drainable porosity nd the latter was calculated by subtracting the residual water content θr from the saturated water content θs which are provided by montzka et al 2017 the areal weighted average of both the logarithm of the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the drainable porosity were computed over each catchment fig 2 the perma ice maps from brown et al 2002 were spatially intersected with each of the 336 catchments percentage values were assigned to each permafrost extent class 95 for continuous 70 for discontinuous 30 for sporadic 5 for isolated and 0 for land without permafrost these percentages were weighted by the intersected area and assigned to their respective catchment fig 3 monthly snow depths sd in cm over the arctic provided by brown 2010 were first averaged on an annual basis and then intersected with catchment contours to estimate a catchment scale snow depth value as the areal weighted average of the overlapping polygons fig 3 the spring snow depth ssd in cm and the duration of the snow coverage period dsp in months were calculated for each catchment using a similar approach meteorological data were sourced from the terraclimate dataset abatzoglou et al 2018 which is a gridded climate reanalysis available at a 4 km resolution for each catchment we computed the areal weighted average of annual air temperature and precipitation for 1970 2000 and determined the annual trend in precipitation δp in mm yr and temperature δt in c yr fig 4 the direction of the trend increasing or decreasing follows the theil sen slope positive or negative calculated with the original test function from the pymannkendal python package shourov and mahmud 2019 without assigning a significance level the resulting dataset covers approximately 10 of the pan arctic drainage basin and represents various 1 surface conditions including vegetation type tundra shrublands taiga broadleaf forests or coniferous forests snow depth ranging from 2 5 cm to 210 cm with a median value of 16 cm and topography plains or mountains 2 subsurface conditions including permafrost extent continuous discontinuous sporadic isolated or no permafrost soil properties k ranging from 3 6 10 7 to 1 3 10 5 m s 1 with a median value of 3 3 10 6 m s 1 and nd ranging from 0 29 to 0 43 with a median value of 0 35 and carbon storage ranging from 10 to 715 kg c m 2 with a median value of 87 kg c m 2 and 3 climatic conditions including δt ranging from 0 001 to 0 07 c yr with a median value of 0 04 c yr and δp ranging from 5 to 19 mm yr with a median value of 0 4 mm yr 3 methods 3 1 conceptual model for recession flow analysis the conceptual model for the recession flow analysis is based on brutsaert 2005 who developed the following solution for one dimensional horizontal flow in an unconfined aquifer based on the linearization of boussinesq equation 1 1 h t k n d x h h x where h is hydraulic head k is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and nd is its drainable porosity the cross section shown in fig 5 illustrates the conceptual model proposed by brutsaert 2005 and it is assumed representative of an entire catchment the active layer corresponds to the aquifer and both terms are used interchangeably here the aquifer is assumed to be homogeneous and initially fully saturated it has an average thickness equal to d and it is underlain by permafrost which is assumed impermeable the aquifer provides baseflow to a river whose water depth is dc and it extends laterally to a distance b away from the river the aquifer responds to a precipitation event by generating an outflow q into the adjoining river fig 5 assuming that flow is horizontal in the aquifer and that the reference elevation head z 0 corresponds to the base of the aquifer the water table elevation wt measured from the base of the aquifer is equal to the hydraulic head the hydraulic head at any given location x and at time t corresponds to the saturated thickness of the aquifer and its average value is equal to h0 in this model the linear reservoir assumption is used such that the hydraulic head variations are assumed to be small compared to the saturated thickness of the aquifer and h never deviates substantially from h0 while linear reservoirs might be rare the linear approximation used by brutsaert 2005 has proven to be robust and useful to solve the boussinesq equation furthermore we assume that the depth of water in the river is small compared to the water table elevations in the aquifer and that dc can be neglected under these assumptions recession starts after precipitation stops and the long term outflow q m3 s per unit length of river m to the river can be computed with equation 2 2 q t q 0 exp α t 3 w i t h q 0 2 k c d 2 b 4 a n d α π 2 k c d 4 n d b 2 where variables are defined in table 1 equation 2 is the one dimensional long term solution of the linearized boussinesq equation combined with darcy s law brutsaert 2005 where t is time with t 0 at the start of recession q0 is the initial outflow at the start of recession and α is the recession constant brutsaert 2008 the outflow q is directly related to the volumetric discharge of the river q m3 s both q0 and α are related to the active layer average thickness d by equations 3 and 4 respectively the geomorphological characteristic b of the catchment represents the extent of the drainage system and is inversely correlated to both q0 and α we assume that annual groundwater recharge remains constant from year to year and that the geomorphological b and hydraulic properties hydraulic conductivity and drainable porosity of the catchment remain unchanged finally we assume that the increase in the thickness of the active layer results exclusively from permafrost thawing under these assumptions it is possible to infer yearly variations of the active layer thickness dd dt from yearly variations of the recession constant dα dt and or initial recession outflow dq0 dt as shown by equations 5 and 6 5 dd d t 4 n d b 2 π 2 k c d α d t 6 dd d t b 4 k c d d q 0 d t in a permafrost region where climate is warming permafrost will thaw and the thickness of the active layer d will increase with time according to the conceptual model and equations 5 and 6 presented here it is expected that recession constant α and initial outflow q0 will increase as d increases the recession constant and the initial outflow can be obtained by a recession curve analysis of streamflow records the objective of the recession curve analysis is to use long term daily streamflow observations to determine the temporal evolution of α and q0 as proxies of the river hydrological signature to provide information on the active layer thickness dynamics which corresponds to the dynamic variation in aquifer thickness 3 2 recession curve analysis we applied a methodology similar to that outlined in lyon et al 2009 sjöberg et al 2013 and evans et al 2020 for each catchment records of daily river discharge q m3 s for the 1970 2000 period were divided into subsets of 5 year overlapping periods upon which the recession analysis was performed for each subset only the summer periods july august and september were investigated in order to i isolate the periods of recession flow resulting essentially from baseflow and ii minimize the possible influence of snowmelt periods of rising streamflow and a 3 day period following each hydrograph peak were removed from the subset records since they are likely to be influenced by rainfall over a 5 year moving window the median of all values of initial recession outflow which is defined as the discharge value 3 days after recession begins was calculated the annual value of q0 for the first year of the 5 year moving window was then assumed equal to the computed median this computation was repeated for every year flow recession d q d t was defined as the difference in discharge between two successive days d q d t q t q t d t d t the average discharge q av over a 2 day period was defined as q av q t q t d t 2 values of d q d t versus q av in log log space were fitted with the following linear least square regression equation using ordinary least squares function 7 ln dq dt ln α b ln q av if b is assumed equal to 1 equation 7 is equivalent to equation 2 which is the assumption of a linear reservoir equation 7 shows that the logarithm of the recession constant α is the intercept of the plot of d q d t vs q av in log log space similar to the initial outflow the recession constant α for a given year was determined by calculating the intercept of equation 7 over a 5 year moving window the methodology is illustrated in fig 6 for the stream gauge cameron river below reid lake north west territories canada over the five year window 1980 1985 3 3 trend test the mann kendall mk non parametric test was used to analyze time series of the annual recession constant α and initial recession outflow q0 to identify consistently increasing or decreasing trends monotonic trends for the 1970 2000 period the original test function from pymannkendal python package shourov and mahmud 2019 was used with significance at the 99 95 and 90 levels the outputs of interest are i the p value of the significance mk test p 0 05 p 0 1 and p 0 1 and ii the theil sen slope positive negative or null depending on the p value and the sign of the theil sen slope seven possible trend assignments may result from the mk test 3 4 factor analysis to explore the relationships between the 11 factors mentioned in section 2 2 and the observed trends of recession constant α and initial recession outflow q0 two factor analyses were performed for each catchment univariate and multivariate the analyses were conducted separately for α and q0 the univariate analysis performed with anova test separately assesses the direct impact of each controlling factor on the trend of α or q0 in addition to the univariate analysis the multivariate analysis tests the non linearity of the relationship between the trend of α or q0 and the controlling factors with a classification tree a classification tree is a supervised learning technique that predicts categorical responses with learning decision rules derived from observations the observations are the trends for α for 192 catchments and the trends for q0 for 167 catchments for which p 0 1 the categorical responses are increasing and decreasing trend for α and for q0 and features that organize the classification are the 11 factors mentioned in section 2 2 the latter analysis was performed with the rpart function in r therneau et al 2013 based on all 11 factors to avoid overfitting of the classification trees a total of 10 cross validations were run with a minimum of 7 observations in any terminal leaf and with a maximum depth of 3 nodes 4 results 4 1 trends contrary to previous studies lyon and destouni 2010 lyon et al 2009 sjöberg et al 2013 a majority of catchments exhibit decreasing trends for 1970 2000 for both recession constant α and initial recession outflow q0 at all significance levels of the mann kendall test p value figs 7 and 8 for the 336 catchments studied the ratio of catchments with decreasing increasing trends for α increases with the significance level of the mann kendall test 1 219 117 ratio 1 87 catchments for p 0 1 2 139 56 ratio 2 48 catchments for p 0 1 and 3 123 45 ratio 2 73 catchments for p 0 05 where the first number is the number of catchments with a decreasing trend and the second is the number of catchments with an increasing trend the spatial distribution of these catchments with increasing or decreasing trends at the various p levels is shown in fig 7 the ratio of catchments with decreasing increasing trends for q0 also generally increases with the significance level of the mann kendall test 1 170 142 ratio 1 19 catchments for p 0 1 2 96 74 ratio 1 29 catchments for p 0 1 and 3 77 60 ratio 1 29 catchments for p 0 05 the initial recession outflow for the remaining 24 catchments presents no statistically significant trend for 1970 2000 theil sen slope 0 the spatial distribution of catchments with increasing or decreasing trends at the various p levels is shown in fig 8 a further analysis focuses on 111 catchments with significant trends at level 90 for both α and q0 each of the 111 catchments co evolution of α and q0 is labeled as if both α and q0 decrease if both α and q0 increase if α decreases while q0 increases and if α increases while q0 decreases their spatial distribution is shown in fig 9 two thirds of the 111 catchments have significant trends in the same direction or for both α and q0 which is consistent with the conceptual model equations 5 and 6 however out of these co evolved catchments the majority 72 have decreasing trends for both α and q0 while increasing trends were initially expected the maps of α or and q0 co evolutions shown in figs 7 8 and 9 do not reveal any clear pattern in the spatial distribution of catchments with increasing or decreasing trends some catchments with decreasing trends are located next to catchments with increasing trends the geographic location appears poorly correlated with the evolution of α and q0 this preliminary observation motivated the analysis described in the next section of the impact of additional factors on the evolution of recession parameters other than the geographic location 4 2 univariate analysis for each of the 11 factors veg soc topo nd logk ext δp δt msd ssd and dsp a univariate analysis is used to assess the strength and direction of their correlation first with the α trend and then with the q0 trend the correlation strength for each factor is calculated with delta values δ which are defined as the difference between the mean value of the factor for catchments with an increasing trend for α then q0 and the mean value for catchments with a decreasing trend for α then q0 the δ calculated for each factor for both α and q0 are shown in table 2 they reveal 1 a significant co variance p 0 1 of the α trend with factors ext ssd dsp and topo and 2 a significant co variance p 0 1 of the q0 trend with factors ext soc δt and veg 4 3 multivariate analysis the objective of the multivariate analysis is to explore potential non linearity in the relationship between the factors and the trends in recession parameters considering inter correlation between them the multivariate analysis consisted here in a classification tree analysis for the same 11 factors veg soc topo nd logk ext δp δt msd ssd and dsp for trends in α and q0 the outcome of the multivariate analysis is shown in fig 10 for α and in fig 11 for q0 in such structures leaves represent the categories and branches represent conjunctions on factors that lead to the category from figs 10 and 11 we identify the factors with the largest influence on both α and q0 evolution and the direction of their influence either favoring increasing trend or favoring decreasing trend the degree of influence of the splitting factor decreases from the top to the bottom leaves for the α trend the first decisive factor shown at the top of fig 10 is the extent of the underlying permafrost ext with a decision indicator for a permafrost extent of 91 which corresponds to the lower limit for continuous permafrost for catchments with a permafrost extent 91 the classification tree in fig 10 shows that the second order factor that clusters the direction of the trend in α is the mean annual snow depth msd catchments with msd below 36 cm are more likely to have decreasing α while those with msd above 36 cm are more likely to have increasing α for catchments with msd below 36 cm the third order determining factor is the air temperature increase δt if δt is above 0 024 c yr the recession constant will more likely decrease with time for catchments with msd above 36 cm the third order determining factor is the saturated hydraulic conductivity in that case if k is 6 10 6 m s then α is more likely to increase otherwise α is more likely to decrease fig 10 similar to the α trend the first decisive factor for the q0 trend shown at the top of fig 11 is the extent of the underlying permafrost ext with a decision indicator for an extent of 53 corresponding to the lower limit for discontinuous permafrost for catchments with a permafrost extent 53 the second order factor that clusters the direction of q0 trend is the mean spring snow depth ssd catchments with ssd below 1 6 cm are more likely to have increasing q0 while those with ssd above 1 6 cm are more likely to have decreasing q0 for catchments with ssd above 1 6 cm the third order determining factor is the carbon content of the soil soc for soc beyond 266 kg c m 2 the associated initial recession outflow will more likely increase with time otherwise q0 will more likely decrease for catchments with a permafrost extent 53 either continuous or discontinuous permafrost the second order determining factor is the drainable porosity nd for nd 0 34 q0 is more likely to decrease otherwise q0 is more likely to increase fig 11 ratios below terminal leaves in figs 10 and 11 represent i on the left fractions of the dataset that do belong to the most widely occurring category ii on the right fractions of the dataset that do not belong to the category i e the error of the classification from these ratios we are able to assess the performance of the classification technique 29 error in predictions for α evolution and 44 error in predictions for q0 evolution calculation details are provided in the caption of figs 10 and 11 5 discussion according to the conceptual model equations 5 and 6 and previous studies lyon et al 2009 lyon and destouni 2010 sjöberg et al 2013 the recession constant α and the initial recession outflow q0 should increase with the thickening of the active layer caused by climate warming however the majority of catchments investigated do not show this expected behavior but have an opposite trend instead with a decreasing recession constant for 65 fig 7 and a decreasing initial recession outflow for 51 fig 8 the discussion focuses on the following assumptions behind the conceptual model i flow in the aquifer can be represented by the 1d boussinesq equation ii the catchment behaves as a linear reservoir iii the annual recharge is constant from year to year and iv the geomorphological and hydraulic properties of the catchment remain homogeneous and unchanged each assumption is discussed in light of the results presented above for the 11 controlling factors that were selected to identify possible causes that may validate or not the assumptions 5 1 flow in the aquifer is represented by the 1d boussinesq equation the solution to the 1d boussinesq equation assumes for the entire catchment that groundwater flow in the active layer is horizontal the river is the location of all groundwater discharge and the bottom of the active layer coincides with the top of the permafrost which is assumed to be an impermeable boundary therefore the solution does not account for deeper groundwater flow that would by pass the river one potential consequence of permafrost thawing is the opening of intra permafrost channels that connect supra permafrost aquifers such as the active layer to sub permafrost aquifers in that case groundwater flow may no longer be limited to the active layer and groundwater from the active layer may flow deeper in sub permafrost aquifers through intra permafrost connections as illustrated in fig 12 a koch et al 2014 quinton and baltzer 2013 vertical groundwater flow components are generated such that not all groundwater exits in the river which is contrary to the assumption of the boussinesq equation also the thickness d of the aquifer is no longer equal to the thickness of the active layer because it would also include other contributing areas that become connected to the river because of permafrost thawing connon et al 2014 topography may also induce vertical groundwater flow for example in mountainous environments the topographic gradient is high and topography driven flow at a regional scale can occur tóth 1999 results shown in table 2 indicate that for high topo mountains the recession constant α decreases and conversely it increases for low topo plains one potential explanation for the decrease of the recession constant in mountainous environments is that there may be substantial regional groundwater flow and consequently groundwater may travel deeper in sub permafrost aquifers and by pass the river fig 12 a which is not consistent with assumption i consequently α may decrease despite active layer thickening conversely if the gradient is low plains groundwater flow will be primarily horizontal and limited to the active layer fig 12 b which is consistent with assumption i as a result α increases with the thickening of the active layer thickening as suggested by results in table 2 results obtained for the soil organic carbon soc can also be examined in light of the assumption inherent to boussinesq solution as shown in table 2 there is a positive correlation between soc and q0 with δ equal to 56 6 kg c m 2 and fig 11 shows the 4th leaf of the classification tree for q0 with decisive soc value equal to 266 kg c m 2 these results indicate that a high organic carbon content in soils is correlated to increasing values for q0 which is in agreement with assumption i the thermal properties of organic matter impede thawing in summer dry soil and favors freezing in winter frozen soil a high soil organic carbon content may indeed contribute to maintaining the extent of the permafrost in such soils there is a lower probability that intra permafrost channels are created which restricts groundwater flow to the supra permafrost aquifers or the active layer in that case assumption i is valid and q0 and d remain directly related with q0 increasing with the active layer thickening results shown here for the role of topography and soil organic carbon corroborate those from previous studies o connor et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 5 2 linearization of the boussinesq equation the value of coefficient b in equation 7 is an indication of the linearity of the reservoir drainage troch et al 2013 with a value of 1 corresponding to the linearity assumption brutsaert 2005 the assumption of linearity can be relaxed and coefficient b could be adjusted during the recession curve analysis this adjustment might influence the value of constant α and coefficient b might then deviate from 1 which would indicate that groundwater flow in the unconfined aquifer is non linear in changing arctic environments non linearity can originate from various mechanisms such as an increase in the diversity of groundwater flowpaths extensive permafrost losses and large snow cover depths these mechanisms are discussed below 5 2 1 increase in the diversity of groundwater flowpaths catchments for which the trends for α and q0 are represent 20 of all catchments fig 9 for this type of opposite co evolution of α and q0 the reactivity of the aquifer represented by α can be assumed to decrease despite an increase in active layer thickness because groundwater flowpaths are longer and more tortuous permafrost thawing can induce new intra and sub permafrost flowpaths and connections can be created in that case non linearity may arise from more diverse and increased flowpaths that relate to increased availability and connectivity of aquifers thus the non linearity of the reservoir could explain that the recession constant α of catchment type does not follow the evolution of d because the linearity assumption ii is not valid these hypotheses are discussed by brutsaert and nieber 1977 and ploum et al 2019 and could be supported by further investigations quantifying flowpaths diversity for example with isotopic tracing methods to assess the influence of flowpaths diversity on the linearity of the reservoir isotopic tracing methods could be coupled with the calculation of coefficient b by letting coefficient b vary in equation 7 and calculating the slope of d q d t vs q av in log log space 5 2 2 extensive permafrost loss while catchments underlain by permafrost of large extent show increasing trends for α and q0 catchments underlain by spatially less extensive permafrost tend to show decreasing trends for α and q0 these conclusions which corroborate the observations of evans et al 2020 are based on results shown in 1 table 2 that indicate a strong positive correlation between ext and the α trend with a value of δ equal to 10 5 and between ext and q0 with δ equal to 23 2 2 fig 10 where permafrost extent ext is the 1st leaf of the classification tree analysis for α with decisive value at ext 91 and 3 fig 11 where permafrost extent ext is the 1st leaf of the classification tree analysis for q0 with decisive value at ext 53 if the extent of permafrost is large enough above 91 for α and above 53 for q0 the reservoir is more likely to remain linear and consequently the active layer thickening implies an increase in the recession parameters as expected from the conceptual model with extensive permafrost loss the relation between the recession parameters α and q0 and the active layer thickness d becomes more complex and the evolution of the recession parameters cannot be explained by the active layer thickening only extensive permafrost loss leads to non linear behavior of the overlying reservoir as pointed out by hinzman et al 2020 using an approach similar to that of hinzman et al 2020 we could for each of the 336 catchments relate the estimated coefficient b equation 7 to permafrost extents to quantify the influence of permafrost extent on reservoir linearity 5 2 3 thick snow pack the 2nd leaf of the classification tree analysis for q0 fig 11 shows that a thick spring snow cover with decisive value at 1 6 cm favours decreasing q0 this result can be explained by loss of linearity of the reservoir associated with a thick spring snow cover if the snowmelt event associated with the snow depth becomes too extreme the linearity between river discharge and groundwater storage might be lost bense et al 2009 in that situation assumption ii is not verified and equation 3 that relates q0 and d gets more complex with q0 decreasing despite an increase in active layer thickness relating b values with snow depth values for each catchment could help to quantify the influence of snow depth on reservoir linearity 5 3 constant annual recharge from year to year the water budget for the catchment can be expressed as brutsaert and hiyama 2012 8 p e r t h n d d h 0 dt c n d dd dt where p is precipitation rainfall snowfall e is evaporation r is runoff and th is the permafrost thawing rate precipitation evaporation and runoff have a direct impact on aquifer recharge which in turn controls the saturated thickness h0 or equivalently d annual variations in p e and r can therefore lead to annual variations in aquifer recharge and thickness d according to equation 8 annual variations in aquifer thickness d would only result from thawing permafrost if those components of the water budget are balanced p e r 0 in equation 8 which corresponds to a constant recharge from year to year to directly link permafrost thawing and changes in aquifer thickness the volume of groundwater recharge is therefore assumed constant from year to year evans et al 2020 illustrate in their fig 1 that assuming constant recharge leads to the conservation of volume under the recession curves they investigated for the period 1913 to 2003 however visual inspection of the recession hydrographs for each catchment studied here indicates that most do not exhibit volume conservation between the beginning and the end of the period analyzed to illustrate that volume is not conserved the shape of a typical recession event for each observed hydrograph is shown in fig 13 in relation to each type of co evolution and on the left and on the right besides for the dataset used precipitation either increases or decreases during the 1970 2000 period rather than remaining constant fig 4 catchments with decreasing precipitations which are colored in green in fig 4 closely coincide with catchment type identified as blue diamonds in fig 9 this relationship therefore suggests that decreasing trends in recession parameters might be related to decrease in precipitation p in equation 8 which would offset an increasing trend caused by permafrost thawing th in equation 8 moreover table 2 shows that high vegetation veg leads to decreasing q0 negative correlation between veg and q0 and fig 10 shows that high temperature increase δt favors decreasing α with the 4th leaf of the classification tree with decisive value δt at 0 024 c yr both high vegetation and high δt enhance evapotranspiration which reduces aquifer recharge decreasing trends in recession parameters might therefore also be related to evaporation increase e in equation 8 which would offset an increasing trend caused by permafrost thawing th in equation 8 in the above situations recharge does not remain constant with time and assumption iii is not valid when recharge varies changes in recession parameters α and q0 can be caused by recharge originating from p e and r processes by permafrost thawing th or by a combination of all processes p e r and th variable recharge complicates the interpretation of the recession curve analysis for example according to table 2 strong positive correlation between dsp and α with δ 0 5 mth and fig 10 second leaf of the classification tree with decisive msd value at 36 cm high dsp and or high msd favors increasing α in this situation it is difficult to determine whether α increases due to potentially increasing snowmelt recharge permafrost thawing or a combination of both processes snow in a thick snowpack insulates the soil from cold atmospheric temperatures which leads to warmer subsurface temperatures and thawing permafrost park et al 2013 as a result both recharge variation and permafrost thawing influence d and then α in the same direction to identify the specific cause for an increase in α for a given catchment it would be necessary to obtain information on the evolution of snowmelt recharge for the catchment ideally recharge changes should be included to analyze the evolution of recession parameters α and q0 5 4 geomorphological and hydraulic properties remain homogeneous and unchanged the multivariate analysis reveals that the saturated hydraulic conductivity and drainable porosity are key factors driving the evolution of the recession parameters the saturated hydraulic conductivity negatively influences the evolution of recession constant α at the third impact degree as shown in fig 10 where logk is the 5th leaf of the classification tree for the recession constant with decisive value at k 6 10 6 m s the drainable porosity positively influences the evolution of the initial recession outflow q0 at the second impact degree as shown in fig 11 where nd is the 3rd leaf of the classification tree with decisive value at nd 0 34 these observations are not consistent with assumption iv expanding the study area increases the ranges of k and nd values which influence the hydrologic signature of the associated river previous studies considered smaller size catchments with likely more homogeneous soil properties assuming geomorphological stability of the drainage network can also be questioned in a warming arctic environment the permafrost extent can decrease from continuous to discontinuous sporadic or even isolated permafrost and the groundwater flowpaths can get longer and more tortuous see section 5 2 the impact of changing permafrost extent and groundwater flowpaths on the geomorphological characteristics of the catchment and drainage network extent remains unclear 6 conclusion the strength of this study lies in the analysis of 336 arctic rivers daily discharge is one of the few data available in the arctic with such large temporal and spatial extents for such a poorly instrumented region where data collection is constrained by difficult access and extreme environmental conditions discharge data is a valuable source of information if we were able to make streamflow observations speak clearly enough to reflect catchment scale permafrost dynamics the hydrogeological knowledge of arctic regions would progress considerably this is the challenge that recession analysis attempts to address this study is not the first that tries to improve the robustness and the adaptability of recession analysis method to cold regions but it is the first one that analyses i such a large number of catchments spread all over the arctic in such diverse environments ii a 30 year time period common to each catchment and iii the correlation between recession parameters and an extended range of potential controlling environmental factors from this study we are able to identify that i low topography high organic content and high permafrost extent support a direct relationship between the trend in recession parameters and active layer thickness evolution as suggested by the conceptual model ii precipitation evapotranspiration snowmelt variations hydraulic conductivity and porosity affect this relationship and may invalidate the conceptual model iii some factors have an ambiguous impact for example snow depth increases active layer thickening because of its insulating capacity but it can also induce non linearity and iv high topography and low permafrost extent increase the complexity of the relationship between recession parameters and active layer thickness the study also goes further by investigating the mechanisms behind the increased complexity of the relationship between recession parameters and the active layer thickness while groundwater flow limited to supra permafrost favours linearity mechanisms that generate additional groundwater flow paths might induce non linearity these mechanisms derivate from permafrost thawing and can be permafrost extent loss hydrologic connectivity increase flow path diversity increase and contributing drainage area multiplication the robustness of our results is ensured by the large number of catchments studied and by previous studies corroborating our findings bense et al 2009 park et al 2013 quinton and baltzer 2013 connon et al 2014 koch et al 2014 o connor et al 2019 ploum et al 2019 evans et al 2020 hinzman et al 2020 the present study goes further in the analysis by including the initial outflow which brings more insights on the above mentioned mechanisms thus we recommend including these additional parameters in future flow recession analyses as the active layer thickening is likely to intensify with continued warming results of this work may consolidate the understanding of ground surface interactions in cold regions and be used as a base to build a predictive model of active layer thickening based on environmental and hydrological observations it would be useful to build a model able to predict active layer thickness evolution based on recession parameters evolution only the model would include the above mentioned mechanisms and factors and its calibration could rely on active

4269,due to polar amplification of climate change high latitudes are warming up twice as fast as the rest of the world this warming leads to permafrost thawing which increases the thickness of the overlying active layer and modifies the subsurface hydrologic regime of the draining watershed therefore affecting baseflow to surface water and modifying recession characteristics the active layer thickening and the subsurface flow modification are assumed to be linearly correlated the objective of this study is to test this assumption by quantifying the correlation between the temporal evolution of hydrologic parameters recession slope and initial recession outflow and 11 controlling factors all linked to surface subsurface and climatic conditions for 336 arctic catchments from 1970 to 2000 contrary to previous studies we demonstrate a clear decrease in recession slope and initial recession outflow over 1970 2000 for a majority of catchments at any significance level we explain this result by identifying high topography and low permafrost extent as controlling factors that complexify the relationship between trends in recession parameters and active layer thickness evolution the study goes further by identifying the mechanisms behind the complexification of the relationship permafrost extent loss hydrologic connectivity increase flow path diversity increase contributing drainage area multiplication the novel aspect of the study lay behind the large number of studied catchments and the large range of controlling factors tested keywords arctic hydrology large scale recession analysis thawing permafrost active layer thickening 1 introduction permafrost is defined as soil or rock that remains at or below 0 c for at least two consecutive years french 2018 the active layer is a superficial seasonally frozen layer located above permafrost because it is susceptible to air temperature variations the active layer freezes in winter and thaws in summer the thickness of the active layer rarely exceeds a few meters while that of the permafrost can reach hundreds of meters permafrost acts as an impermeable barrier and groundwater flow in permafrost regions is limited to unfrozen zones that may exist above supra permafrost also equivalent to the active layer beneath sub permafrost or within intra permafrost permafrost in arctic regions permafrost is thawing as a result of climate warming the circumpolar active layer monitoring calm program which monitors the evolution of the active layer of 100 northern high latitude sites has shown deeper thaw penetration and increased active layer thickness over the last decades brown et al 2000 during the same period the minimum and total discharges of rivers in high latitude catchments have increased smith et al 2007 rood et al 2017 baseflow has increased walvoord and striegl 2007 groundwater flow paths have become longer and deeper bense et al 2009 and the vertical hydraulic connectivity in the subsurface has increased walvoord et al 2012 because the active layer can represent a local aquifer its thickening caused by permafrost thawing also increases groundwater flow which in turn increases baseflow to rivers the hydrological signature of a river is characterized among other factors by its recession constant α and initial recession outflow q0 in theory an increased active layer thickness caused by permafrost thawing should lead to increases in recession constant and initial recession outflow previous studies lyon et al 2009 brutsaert and hiyama 2012 tested this theoretical relationship with recession flow analysis based on the 1d boussinesq equation their aim was to quantify rates of permafrost thawing from the recession flow analysis studies that used the same approach analyzed a limited number of catchments lyon and destouni 2010 sjöberg et al 2013 ploum et al 2019 and revealed the complexity in the interpretation of results evans et al 2020 hinzman et al 2020 to understand the subsurface behavior of catchments exposed to extreme cold temperatures and freeze thaw cycles the sole river hydrological signature cannot thoroughly reflect the dynamics of the underlying active layer other factors should be taken into account to better describe groundwater and surface water interactions in arctic regions for example evans et al 2020 included permafrost extent in their analysis however recent findings indicate that climatic conditions might also modify the storage discharge relationships hinzman et al 2020 our study generalizes previous results by expanding the recession flow analysis to 336 heterogeneous arctic catchments and by testing the influence of 11 controlling factors the selected controlling factors are grouped whether they are associated to the surface subsurface or climate factors associated with the surface include vegetation snow cover and topography factors associated with the subsurface include permafrost distribution soil properties and carbon storage factors related to climate include air temperature and precipitation the primary objectives of this study are to 1 determine the evolution of the recession constant α and the initial recession outflow q0 with climate warming over the 1970 2000 period 2 analyze how trends for α and q0 statistically vary with surface subsurface and climatic factors and 3 determine the role of surface subsurface and climatic factors as controls for the relationship between the active layer thickness and α and q0 2 presentation of the study area and data 2 1 catchment selection daily discharge m3 s time series from 336 unregulated catchments that belong to the pan arctic drainage basin were analyzed the time series originated from four data providers global runoff data centre n 131 water survey of canada n 134 r arcticnet n 60 and swedish meteorological and hydrological institute n 11 they span at least 25 years over the 30 year period between 1970 and 2000 for catchments located between latitudes 47 and 70 the median is 57 and whose drainage areas range from 6 to 50 000 km2 the median is 3000 km2 the location and area size were chosen to maximize the number of catchments and length of the time series the upper limit of 50 000 km2 for the drainage area was chosen i to ensure somewhat homogeneous environmental characteristics such as vegetation and snow cover soil conditions and precipitation for each catchment and ii to limit potential distortions resulting from the diversity in the hydrological signature of nested catchments using a common reference period of thirty years 1970 2000 which is consistent with the period used for impact studies of climate change enables comparison between catchments while eliminating discrepancies that could be related to the characteristics of the selected time period 2 2 catchment environmental conditions previous studies have shown that a range of key factors impact the active layer dynamics and or the hydrological behavior of catchments these factors include permafrost extent evans et al 2020 vegetation bring et al 2016 prowse et al 2015 topography bring et al 2016 o connor et al 2019 snow

smith 2006 karlsson et al 2015 rawlins et al 2009 and temperature karlsson et al 2015 based on these studies 11 controlling factors were calculated and assigned to each catchment 1 vegetation height

over the time period δt in c yr a map of terrestrial ecoregions was obtained from olson et al 2001 and spatially intersected with each of the 336 catchments each catchment was assigned a single ecoregion type that corresponds to its predominant type olson et al 2001 defined fourteen major ecoregion types to reflect terrestrial biodiversity five of these ecoregions are represented in our dataset 1 tundra arctic 2 temperate grasslands savannas and shrublands temperate semiarid 3 boreal forests taiga subarctic humid 4 temperate broadleaf and mixed forests temperate humid and 5 temperate coniferous forests temperate humid to semi humid ranging from the shortest of tundra types to the highest forest conditions to represent these five ecoregion types factor veg was assigned numerical values that range from 1 to 5 with the value increasing for increasing relative vegetation height fig 1 we also extracted the topography for each catchment from olson et al 2001 and assigned to factor topo a value equal to 1 for boreal plains and a value equal to 1 for mountains estimated soil organic carbon storage values soc in kg c m 2 at a depth of 300 cm were obtained from hugelius et al 2013 and were averaged over each catchment they were available for 286 catchments fig 1 the soil hydraulic properties for each catchment were derived from montzka et al 2017 they include the saturated hydraulic conductivity k in m s at a depth of 200 cm and the drainable porosity nd the latter was calculated by subtracting the residual water content θr from the saturated water content θs which are provided by montzka et al 2017 the areal weighted average of both the logarithm of the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the drainable porosity were computed over each catchment fig 2 the perma ice maps from brown et al 2002 were spatially intersected with each of the 336 catchments percentage values were assigned to each permafrost extent class 95 for continuous 70 for discontinuous 30 for sporadic 5 for isolated and 0 for land without permafrost these percentages were weighted by the intersected area and assigned to their respective catchment fig 3 monthly snow depths sd in cm over the arctic provided by brown 2010 were first averaged on an annual basis and then intersected with catchment contours to estimate a catchment scale snow depth value as the areal weighted average of the overlapping polygons fig 3 the spring snow depth ssd in cm and the duration of the snow coverage period dsp in months were calculated for each catchment using a similar approach meteorological data were sourced from the terraclimate dataset abatzoglou et al 2018 which is a gridded climate reanalysis available at a 4 km resolution for each catchment we computed the areal weighted average of annual air temperature and precipitation for 1970 2000 and determined the annual trend in precipitation δp in mm yr and temperature δt in c yr fig 4 the direction of the trend increasing or decreasing follows the theil sen slope positive or negative calculated with the original test function from the pymannkendal python package shourov and mahmud 2019 without assigning a significance level the resulting dataset covers approximately 10 of the pan arctic drainage basin and represents various 1 surface conditions including vegetation type tundra shrublands taiga broadleaf forests or coniferous forests snow depth ranging from 2 5 cm to 210 cm with a median value of 16 cm and topography plains or mountains 2 subsurface conditions including permafrost extent continuous discontinuous sporadic

storage ranging from 10 to 715 kg c m 2 with a median value of 87 kg c m 2 and 3 climatic conditions including δt ranging from 0 001 to 0 07 c yr with a median value of 0 04 c yr and δp ranging from 5 to 19 mm yr with a median value of 0 4 mm yr 3 methods 3 1 conceptual model for recession flow analysis the conceptual model for the recession flow analysis is based on brutsaert 2005 who developed the following solution for one dimensional horizontal flow in an unconfined aquifer based on the linearization of boussinesq equation 1 1 h t k n d x h h x where h is hydraulic head k is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and nd is its drainable porosity the cross section shown in fig 5 illustrates the conceptual model proposed by brutsaert 2005 and it is assumed representative of an entire catchment the active layer corresponds to the aquifer and both terms are used interchangeably here the aquifer is assumed to be homogeneous and initially fully saturated it has an average thickness equal to d and it is underlain by permafrost which is assumed impermeable the aquifer provides baseflow to a river whose water depth is dc and it extends laterally to a distance b away from the river the aquifer responds to a precipitation event by generating an outflow q into the adjoining river fig 5 assuming that flow is horizontal in the aquifer and that the reference elevation head z 0 corresponds to the base of the aquifer the water table elevation wt measured from the base of the aquifer is equal to the hydraulic head the hydraulic head at any given location x and at time t corresponds to the saturated thickness of the aquifer and its average value is equal to h0 in this model the linear reservoir assumption is used such that the hydraulic head variations are assumed to be small compared to the saturated thickness of the aquifer and h never deviates substantially from h0 while linear reservoirs might be rare the linear approximation used by brutsaert 2005 has proven to be robust and useful to solve the boussinesq equation furthermore we assume that the depth of water in the river is small compared to the water table elevations in the aquifer and that dc can be neglected under these assumptions recession starts after precipitation stops and the long term outflow q m3 s per unit length of river m to the river can be computed with equation 2 2 q t q 0 exp α t 3 w i t h q 0 2 k c d 2 b 4 a n d α π 2 k c d 4 n d b 2 where variables are defined in table 1 equation 2 is the one dimensional long term solution of the linearized boussinesq equation combined with darcy s law brutsaert 2005 where t is time with t 0 at the start of recession q0 is the initial outflow at the start of recession and α is the recession constant brutsaert 2008 the outflow q is directly related to the volumetric discharge of the river q m3 s both q0 and α are related to the active layer average thickness d by equations 3 and 4 respectively the geomorphological characteristic b of the catchment represents the extent of the drainage system and is inversely correlated to both q0 and α we assume that annual groundwater recharge remains constant from year to year and that the geomorphological b and hydraulic properties hydraulic conductivity and drainable porosity of the catchment remain unchanged finally we assume that the increase in the thickness of the active layer results exclusively from permafrost thawing under these assumptions it is possible to infer yearly variations of the active layer thickness dd dt from yearly variations of the recession constant dα dt and or initial recession outflow dq0 dt as shown by equations 5 and 6 5 dd d t 4 n d b 2 π 2 k c d α d t 6 dd d t b 4 k c d d q 0 d t in a permafrost region where climate is warming permafrost will thaw and the thickness of the active layer d will increase with time according to the conceptual model and equations 5 and 6 presented here it is expected that recession constant α and initial outflow q0 will increase as d increases the recession constant and the initial outflow can be obtained by a recession curve analysis of streamflow records the objective of the recession curve analysis is to use long term daily streamflow observations to determine the temporal evolution of α and q0 as proxies of the river hydrological signature to provide information on the active layer thickness dynamics which corresponds to the dynamic variation in aquifer thickness 3 2 recession curve analysis we applied a methodology similar to that outlined in lyon et al 2009 sjöberg et al 2013 and evans et al 2020 for each catchment records of daily river discharge q m3 s for the 1970 2000 period were divided into subsets of 5 year overlapping periods upon which the recession analysis was performed for each subset only the summer periods july august and september were investigated in order to i isolate the periods of recession flow resulting essentially from baseflow and ii minimize the possible influence of snowmelt periods of rising streamflow and a 3 day period following each hydrograph peak were removed from the subset records since they are likely to be influenced by rainfall over a 5 year moving window the median of all values of initial recession outflow which is defined as the discharge value 3 days after recession begins was calculated the annual value of q0 for the first year of the 5 year moving window was then assumed equal to the computed median this computation was repeated for every year flow recession d q d t was defined as the difference in discharge between two successive days d q d t q t q t d t d t the average discharge q av over a 2 day period was defined as q av q t q t d t 2 values of d q d t versus q av in log log space were fitted with the following linear least square regression equation using ordinary least squares function 7 ln dq dt ln α b ln q av if b is assumed equal to 1 equation 7 is equivalent to equation 2 which is the assumption of a linear reservoir equation 7 shows that the logarithm of the recession constant α is the intercept of the plot of d q d t vs q av in log log space similar to the initial outflow the recession constant α for a given year was determined by calculating the intercept of equation 7 over a 5 year moving window the methodology is illustrated in fig 6 for the stream gauge cameron river below reid lake north west territories canada over the five year window 1980 1985 3 3 trend test the mann kendall mk non parametric test was used to analyze time series of the annual recession constant α and initial recession outflow q0 to identify consistently increasing or decreasing trends monotonic trends for the 1970 2000 period the original test function from pymannkendal python package shourov and mahmud 2019 was used with significance at the 99 95 and 90 levels the outputs of interest are i the p value of the significance mk test p 0 05 p 0 1 and p 0 1 and ii the theil sen slope positive negative or null depending on the p value and the sign of the theil sen slope seven possible trend assignments may result from the mk test 3 4 factor analysis to explore the relationships between the 11 factors mentioned in section 2 2 and the observed trends of recession constant α and initial recession outflow q0 two factor analyses were performed for each catchment univariate and multivariate the analyses were conducted separately for α and q0 the univariate analysis performed with anova test separately assesses the direct impact of each controlling factor on the trend of α or q0 in addition to the univariate analysis the multivariate analysis tests the non linearity of the relationship between the trend of α or q0 and the controlling factors with a classification tree a classification tree is a supervised learning technique that predicts categorical responses with learning decision rules derived from observations the observations are the trends for α for 192 catchments and the trends for q0 for 167 catchments for which p 0 1 the categorical responses are increasing and decreasing trend for α and for q0 and features that organize the classification are the 11 factors mentioned in section 2 2 the latter analysis was performed with the rpart function in r therneau et al 2013 based on all 11 factors to avoid overfitting of the classification trees a total of 10 cross validations were run with a minimum of 7 observations in any terminal leaf and with a maximum depth of 3 nodes 4 results 4 1 trends contrary to previous studies lyon and destouni 2010 lyon et al 2009 sjöberg et al 2013 a majority of catchments exhibit decreasing trends for 1970 2000 for both recession constant α and initial recession outflow q0 at all significance levels of the mann kendall test p value figs 7 and 8 for the 336 catchments studied the ratio of catchments with decreasing increasing trends for α increases with the significance level of the mann kendall test 1 219 117 ratio 1 87 catchments for p 0 1 2 139 56 ratio 2 48 catchments for p 0 1 and 3 123 45 ratio 2 73 catchments for p 0 05 where the first number is the number of catchments with a decreasing trend and the second is the number of catchments with an increasing trend the spatial distribution of these catchments with increasing or decreasing trends at the various p levels is shown in fig 7 the ratio of catchments with decreasing increasing trends for q0 also generally increases with the significance level of the mann kendall test 1 170 142 ratio 1 19 catchments for p 0 1 2 96 74 ratio 1 29 catchments for p 0 1 and 3 77 60 ratio 1 29 catchments for p 0 05 the initial recession outflow for the remaining 24 catchments presents no statistically significant trend for 1970 2000 theil sen slope 0 the spatial distribution of catchments with increasing or decreasing trends at the various p levels is shown in fig 8 a further analysis focuses on 111 catchments with significant trends at level 90 for both α and q0 each of the 111 catchments co evolution of α and q0 is labeled as if both α and q0 decrease if both α and q0 increase if α decreases while q0 increases and if α increases while q0 decreases their spatial distribution is shown in fig 9 two thirds of the 111 catchments have significant trends in the same direction or for both α and q0 which is consistent with the conceptual model equations 5 and 6 however out of these co evolved catchments the majority 72 have decreasing trends for both α and q0 while increasing trends were initially expected the maps of α or and q0 co evolutions shown in figs 7 8 and 9 do not reveal any clear pattern in the spatial distribution of catchments with increasing or decreasing trends some catchments with decreasing trends are located next to catchments with increasing trends the geographic location appears poorly correlated with the evolution of α and q0 this preliminary observation motivated the analysis described in the next section of the impact of additional factors on the evolution of recession parameters other than the geographic location 4 2 univariate analysis for each of the 11 factors veg soc topo nd logk ext δp δt msd ssd and dsp a univariate analysis is used to assess the strength and direction of their correlation first with the α trend and then with the q0 trend the correlation strength for each factor is calculated with delta values δ which are defined as the difference between the mean value of the factor for catchments with an increasing trend for α then q0 and the mean value for catchments with a decreasing trend for α then q0 the δ calculated for each factor for both α and q0 are shown in table 2 they reveal 1 a significant co variance p 0 1 of the α trend with factors ext ssd dsp and topo and 2 a significant co variance p 0 1 of the q0 trend with factors ext soc δt and veg 4 3 multivariate analysis the objective of the multivariate analysis is to explore potential non linearity in the relationship between the factors and the trends in recession parameters considering inter correlation between them the multivariate analysis consisted here in a classification tree analysis for the same 11 factors veg soc topo nd logk ext δp δt msd ssd and dsp for trends in α and q0 the outcome of the multivariate analysis is shown in fig 10 for α and in fig 11 for q0 in such structures leaves represent the categories and branches represent conjunctions on factors that lead to the category from figs 10 and 11 we identify the factors with the largest influence on both α and q0 evolution and the direction of their influence either favoring increasing trend or favoring decreasing trend the degree of influence of the splitting factor decreases from the top to the bottom leaves for the α trend the first decisive factor shown at the top of fig 10 is the extent of the underlying permafrost ext with a decision indicator for a permafrost extent of 91 which corresponds to the lower limit for continuous permafrost for catchments with a permafrost extent 91 the classification tree in fig 10 shows that the second order factor that clusters the direction of the trend in α is the mean annual snow depth msd catchments with msd below 36 cm are more likely to have decreasing α while those with msd above 36 cm are more likely to have increasing α for catchments with msd below 36 cm the third order determining factor is the air temperature increase δt if δt is above 0 024 c yr the recession constant will more likely decrease with time for catchments with msd above 36 cm the third order determining factor is the saturated hydraulic conductivity in that case if k is 6 10 6 m s then α is more likely to increase otherwise α is more likely to decrease fig 10 similar to the α trend the first decisive factor for the q0 trend shown at the top of fig 11 is the extent of the underlying permafrost ext with a decision indicator for an extent of 53 corresponding to the lower limit for discontinuous permafrost for catchments with a permafrost extent 53 the second order factor that clusters the direction of q0 trend is the mean spring snow depth ssd catchments with ssd below 1 6 cm are more likely to have increasing q0 while those with ssd above 1 6 cm are more likely to have decreasing q0 for catchments with ssd above 1 6 cm the third order determining factor is the carbon content of the soil soc for soc beyond 266 kg c m 2 the associated initial recession outflow will more likely increase with time otherwise q0 will more likely decrease for catchments with a permafrost extent 53 either continuous or discontinuous permafrost the second order determining factor is the drainable porosity nd for nd 0 34 q0 is more likely to decrease otherwise q0 is more likely to increase fig 11 ratios below terminal leaves in figs 10 and 11 represent i on the left fractions of the dataset that do belong to the most widely occurring category ii on the right fractions of the dataset that do not belong to the category i e the error of the classification from these ratios we are able to assess the performance of the classification technique 29 error in predictions for α evolution and 44 error in predictions for q0 evolution calculation details are provided in the caption of figs 10 and 11 5 discussion according to the conceptual model equations 5 and 6 and previous studies lyon et al 2009 lyon and destouni 2010 sjöberg et al 2013 the recession constant α and the initial recession outflow q0 should increase with the thickening of the active layer caused by climate warming however the majority of catchments investigated do not show this expected behavior but have an opposite trend instead with a decreasing recession constant for 65 fig 7 and a decreasing initial recession outflow for 51 fig 8 the discussion focuses on the following assumptions behind the conceptual model i flow in the aquifer can be represented by the 1d boussinesq equation ii the catchment behaves as a linear reservoir iii the annual recharge is constant from year to year and iv the geomorphological and hydraulic properties of the catchment remain homogeneous and unchanged each assumption is discussed in light of the results presented above for the 11 controlling factors that were selected to identify possible causes that may validate or not the assumptions 5 1 flow in the aquifer is represented by the 1d boussinesq equation the solution to the 1d boussinesq equation assumes for the entire catchment that groundwater flow in the active layer is horizontal the river is the location of all groundwater discharge and the bottom of the active layer coincides with the top of the permafrost which is assumed to be an impermeable boundary therefore the solution does not account for deeper groundwater flow that would by pass the river one potential consequence of permafrost thawing is the opening of intra permafrost channels that connect supra permafrost aquifers such as the active layer to sub permafrost aquifers in that case groundwater flow may no longer be limited to the active layer and groundwater from the active layer may flow deeper in sub permafrost aquifers through intra permafrost connections as illustrated in fig 12 a koch et al 2014 quinton and baltzer 2013 vertical groundwater flow components are generated such that not all groundwater exits in the river which is contrary to the assumption of the boussinesq equation also the thickness d of the aquifer is no longer equal to the thickness of the active layer because it would also include other contributing areas that become connected to the river because of permafrost thawing connon et al 2014 topography may also induce vertical groundwater flow for example in mountainous environments the topographic gradient is high and topography driven flow at a regional scale can occur tóth 1999 results shown in table 2 indicate that for high topo mountains the recession constant α decreases and conversely it increases for low topo plains one potential explanation for the decrease of the recession constant in mountainous environments is that there may be substantial regional groundwater flow and consequently groundwater may travel deeper in sub permafrost aquifers and by pass the river fig 12 a which is not consistent with assumption i consequently α may decrease despite active layer thickening conversely if the gradient is low plains groundwater flow will be primarily horizontal and limited to the active layer fig 12 b which is consistent with assumption i as a result α increases with the thickening of the active layer thickening as suggested by results in table 2 results obtained for the soil organic carbon soc can also be examined in light of the assumption inherent to boussinesq solution as shown in table 2 there is a positive correlation between soc and q0 with δ equal to 56 6 kg c m 2 and fig 11 shows the 4th leaf of the classification tree for q0 with decisive soc value equal to 266 kg c m 2 these results indicate that a high organic carbon content in soils is correlated to increasing values for q0 which is in agreement with assumption i the thermal properties of organic matter impede thawing in summer dry soil and favors freezing in winter frozen soil a high soil organic carbon content may indeed contribute to maintaining the extent of the permafrost in such soils there is a lower probability that intra permafrost channels are created which restricts groundwater flow to the supra permafrost aquifers or the active layer in that case assumption i is valid and q0 and d remain directly related with q0 increasing with the active layer thickening results shown here for the role of topography and soil organic carbon corroborate those from previous studies o connor et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 5 2 linearization of the boussinesq equation the value of coefficient b in equation 7 is an indication of the linearity of the reservoir drainage troch et al 2013 with a value of 1 corresponding to the linearity assumption brutsaert 2005 the assumption of linearity can be relaxed and coefficient b could be adjusted during the recession curve analysis this adjustment might influence the value of constant α and coefficient b might then deviate from 1 which would indicate that groundwater flow in the unconfined aquifer is non linear in changing arctic environments non linearity can originate from various mechanisms such as an increase in the diversity of groundwater flowpaths extensive permafrost losses and large snow cover depths these mechanisms are discussed below 5 2 1 increase in the diversity of groundwater flowpaths catchments for which the trends for α and q0 are represent 20 of all catchments fig 9 for this type of opposite co evolution of α and q0 the reactivity of the aquifer represented by α can be assumed to decrease despite an increase in active layer thickness because groundwater flowpaths are longer and more tortuous permafrost thawing can induce new intra and sub permafrost flowpaths and connections can be created in that case non linearity may arise from more diverse and increased flowpaths that relate to increased availability and connectivity of aquifers thus the non linearity of the reservoir could explain that the recession constant α of catchment type does not follow the evolution of d because the linearity assumption ii is not valid these hypotheses are discussed by brutsaert and nieber 1977 and ploum et al 2019 and could be supported by further investigations quantifying flowpaths diversity for example with isotopic tracing methods to assess the influence of flowpaths diversity on the linearity of the reservoir isotopic tracing methods could be coupled with the calculation of coefficient b by letting coefficient b vary in equation 7 and calculating the slope of d q d t vs q av in log log space 5 2 2 extensive permafrost loss while catchments underlain by permafrost of large extent show increasing trends for α and q0 catchments underlain by spatially less extensive permafrost tend to show decreasing trends for α and q0 these conclusions which corroborate the observations of evans et al 2020 are based on results shown in 1 table 2 that indicate a strong positive correlation between ext and the α trend with a value of δ equal to 10 5 and between ext and q0 with δ equal to 23 2 2 fig 10 where permafrost extent ext is the 1st leaf of the classification tree analysis for α with decisive value at ext 91 and 3 fig 11 where permafrost extent ext is the 1st leaf of the classification tree analysis for q0 with decisive value at ext 53 if the extent of permafrost is large enough above 91 for α and above 53 for q0 the reservoir is more likely to remain linear and consequently the active layer thickening implies an increase in the recession parameters as expected from the conceptual model with extensive permafrost loss the relation between the recession parameters α and q0 and the active layer thickness d becomes more complex and the evolution of the recession parameters cannot be explained by the active layer thickening only extensive permafrost loss leads to non linear behavior of the overlying reservoir as pointed out by hinzman et al 2020 using an approach similar to that of hinzman et al 2020 we could for each of the 336 catchments relate the estimated coefficient b equation 7 to permafrost extents to quantify the influence of permafrost extent on reservoir linearity 5 2 3 thick snow pack the 2nd leaf of the classification tree analysis for q0 fig 11 shows that a thick spring snow cover with decisive value at 1 6 cm favours decreasing q0 this result can be explained by loss of linearity of the reservoir associated with a thick spring snow cover if the snowmelt event associated with the snow depth becomes too extreme the linearity between river discharge and groundwater storage might be lost bense et al 2009 in that situation assumption ii is not verified and equation 3 that relates q0 and d gets more complex with q0 decreasing despite an increase in active layer thickness relating b values with snow depth values for each catchment could help to quantify the influence of snow depth on reservoir linearity 5 3 constant annual recharge from year to year the water budget for the catchment can be expressed as brutsaert and hiyama 2012 8 p e r t h n d d h 0 dt c n d dd dt where p is precipitation rainfall snowfall e is evaporation r is runoff and th is the permafrost thawing rate precipitation evaporation and runoff have a direct impact on aquifer recharge which in turn controls the saturated thickness h0 or equivalently d annual variations in p e and r can therefore lead to annual variations in aquifer recharge and thickness d according to equation 8 annual variations in aquifer thickness d would only result from thawing permafrost if those components of the water budget are balanced p e r 0 in equation 8 which corresponds to a constant recharge from year to year to directly link permafrost thawing and changes in aquifer thickness the volume of groundwater recharge is therefore assumed constant from year to year evans et al 2020 illustrate in their fig 1 that assuming constant recharge leads to the conservation of volume under the recession curves they investigated for the period 1913 to 2003 however visual inspection of the recession hydrographs for each catchment studied here indicates that most do not exhibit volume conservation between the beginning and the end of the period analyzed to illustrate that volume is not conserved the shape of a typical recession event for each observed hydrograph is shown in fig 13 in relation to each type of co evolution and on the left and on the right besides for the dataset used precipitation either increases or decreases during the 1970 2000 period rather than remaining constant fig 4 catchments with decreasing precipitations which are colored in green in fig 4 closely coincide with catchment type identified as blue diamonds in fig 9 this relationship therefore suggests that decreasing trends in recession parameters might be related to decrease in precipitation p in equation 8 which would offset an increasing trend caused by permafrost thawing th in equation 8 moreover table 2 shows that high vegetation veg leads to decreasing q0 negative correlation between veg and q0 and fig 10 shows that high temperature increase δt favors decreasing α with the 4th leaf of the classification tree with decisive value δt at 0 024 c yr both high vegetation and high δt enhance evapotranspiration which reduces aquifer recharge decreasing trends in recession parameters might therefore also be related to evaporation increase e in equation 8 which would offset an increasing trend caused by permafrost thawing th in equation 8 in the above situations recharge does not remain constant with time and assumption iii is not valid when recharge varies changes in recession parameters α and q0 can be caused by recharge originating from p e and r processes by permafrost thawing th or by a combination of all processes p e r and th variable recharge complicates the interpretation of the recession curve analysis for example according to table 2 strong positive correlation between dsp and α with δ 0 5 mth and fig 10 second leaf of the classification tree with decisive msd value at 36 cm high dsp and or high msd favors increasing α in this situation it is difficult to determine whether α increases due to potentially increasing snowmelt recharge permafrost thawing or a combination of both processes snow in a thick snowpack insulates the soil from cold atmospheric temperatures which leads to warmer subsurface temperatures and thawing permafrost park et al 2013 as a result both recharge variation and permafrost thawing influence d and then α in the same direction to identify the specific cause for an increase in α for a given catchment it would be necessary to obtain information on the evolution of snowmelt recharge for the catchment ideally recharge changes should be included to analyze the evolution of recession parameters α and q0 5 4 geomorphological and hydraulic properties remain homogeneous and unchanged the multivariate analysis reveals that the saturated hydraulic conductivity and drainable porosity are key factors driving the evolution of the recession parameters the saturated hydraulic conductivity negatively influences the evolution of recession constant α at the third impact degree as shown in fig 10 where logk is the 5th leaf of the classification tree for the recession constant with decisive value at k 6 10 6 m s the drainable porosity positively influences the evolution of the initial recession outflow q0 at the second impact degree as shown in fig 11 where nd is the 3rd leaf of the classification tree with decisive value at nd 0 34 these observations are not consistent with assumption iv expanding the study area increases the ranges of k and nd values which influence the hydrologic signature of the associated river previous studies considered smaller size catchments with likely more homogeneous soil properties assuming geomorphological stability of the drainage network can also be questioned in a warming arctic environment the permafrost extent can decrease from continuous to discontinuous sporadic or even isolated permafrost and the groundwater flowpaths can get longer and more tortuous see section 5 2 the impact of changing permafrost extent and groundwater flowpaths on the geomorphological characteristics of the catchment and drainage network extent remains unclear 6 conclusion the strength of this study lies in the analysis of 336 arctic rivers daily discharge is one of the few data available in the arctic with such large temporal and spatial extents for such a poorly instrumented region where data collection is constrained by difficult access and extreme environmental conditions discharge data is a valuable source of information if we were able to make streamflow observations speak clearly enough to reflect catchment scale permafrost dynamics the hydrogeological knowledge of arctic regions would progress considerably this is the challenge that recession analysis attempts to address this study is not the first that tries to improve the robustness and the adaptability of recession analysis method to cold regions but it is the first one that analyses i such a large number of catchments spread all over the arctic in such diverse environments ii a 30 year time period common to each catchment and iii the correlation between recession parameters and an extended range of potential controlling environmental factors from this study we are able to identify that i low topography high organic content and high permafrost extent support a direct relationship between the trend in recession parameters and active layer thickness evolution as suggested by the conceptual model ii precipitation evapotranspiration snowmelt variations hydraulic conductivity and porosity affect this relationship and may invalidate the conceptual model iii some factors have an ambiguous impact for example snow depth increases active layer thickening because of its insulating capacity but it can also induce non linearity and iv high topography and low permafrost extent increase the complexity of the relationship between recession parameters and active layer thickness the study also goes further by investigating the mechanisms behind the increased complexity of the relationship between recession parameters and the active layer thickness while groundwater flow limited to supra permafrost favours linearity mechanisms that generate additional groundwater flow paths might induce non linearity these mechanisms derivate from permafrost thawing and can be permafrost extent loss hydrologic connectivity increase flow path diversity increase and contributing drainage area multiplication the robustness of our results is ensured by the large number of catchments studied and by previous studies corroborating our findings bense et al 2009 park et al 2013 quinton and baltzer 2013 connon et al 2014 koch et al 2014 o connor et al 2019 ploum et al 2019 evans et al 2020 hinzman et al 2020 the present study goes further in the analysis by including the initial outflow which brings more insights on the above mentioned mechanisms thus we recommend including these additional parameters in future flow recession analyses as the active layer thickening is likely to intensify with continued warming results of this work may consolidate the understanding of ground surface interactions in cold regions and be used as a base to build a predictive model of active layer thickening based on environmental and hydrological observations it would be useful to build a model able to predict active layer thickness evolution based on recession parameters evolution only the model would include the above mentioned mechanisms and factors and its calibration could rely on active
