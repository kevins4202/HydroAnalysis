9350,china s loess plateau is the optimal and largest region of growing apple trees in the world subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitters sice is an energy efficient and water saving approach for fruit trees in arid and semi arid regions climate change which is shifting annual precipitation regimes is challenging the existing irrigation scheduling however little is known about how annual precipitation change affect the irrigation scheduling with sice therefore simulations with hydrus 2d and validation experiments in apple orchard were used to study the effects of the event and annual scale precipitation and ceramic hydraulic conductivity of emitter chc on soil water dynamics results indicated that annul precipitation slightly affected the irrigation volume however precipitation events had a significant effect on emitter discharge the outflow was 22 7 and 49 7 lower in soil than in air with chc of 0 017 and 0 077 m d 1 there was a significant positive correlation among chc irrigation volume and deep percolation precipitation and chc both have a significant effect on the soil water content in apple orchards the average swcs of wet year were 17 8 24 7 higher than normal and dry year the average swc was 0 154 and 0 191 cm3 cm 3 with emitter hydraulic conductivities of 0 017 and 0 077 m d 1 respectively in 2010 sice could provide a stable soil water environment for apple trees in different precipitation years apple trees could be continuously irrigated by sice until july and irrigation could be stopped when the average swc exceeds 0 20 cm3 cm 3 after july in loess plateau this work may assist orchard managers in adapting their orchards by sice to meet apple growth under future climate change conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords hydrus climate change irrigation apple data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction china s loess plateau clp is the optimal and largest region of apple plantations in the world due to its high variation of diurnal temperature abundant sunshine and thick unsaturated soils yang et al 2020 by the year of 2017 the area of apple orchards has reached 1 3 million ha and annual apple production has exceeded 23 million tons accounting for about 25 of global totals in both area and output gao et al 2021 however the annual precipitation of the regions of cultivating apple trees generally ranges from 450 to 650 mm and mainly occurs in late summer and early autumn therefore these regions often suffer drought from april to early july which greatly affects the blossoming and bearing fruit climate change which is shifting annual precipitation regimes is challenging the existing irrigation scheduling therefore it is pressing to determine the optimal irrigation schedule which should be adapted to climate change to support the sustainability of apple orchards in drylands water saving irrigation technology offers effective ways to improve the utilization of water resources provenzano et al 2014 and thus propose the potential solutions to these problems in recent years many new water saving irrigation technologies have been demonstrated and applied in clp such as subsurface drip irrigation surge root irrigation and subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitters sice cai et al 2021 wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2009 sice is a type of subsurface irrigation that involves gradually supplying water from a source directly to the root area using a capillary medium abioye et al 2020 emission of moisture is driven by the capillary suction of relatively dry soil and thirsty roots in just right quantities spontaneously and continuously with no electronic or mechanical controls cai et al 2018 kacimov and obnosov 2017 however the application of sice on the plateau is currently very limited cai et al 2021 partly because sice systems are more complex than surface irrigation systems and hence more difficult to manage and maintain camp 1998 moreover there is insufficient understanding of sice technology and a better understanding of relevant fundamental theories and technical parameters is required one of the problems is that few studies have addressed the optimal parameters such as emitter discharge and irrigation duration for field application and they cannot be well defined currently gil et al 2008 patel and rajput 2007 wang et al 2021 to identify the optimal technical parameters of any irrigation system it is essential to understand the water dynamics during irrigation especially under climate change the size and distribution of the wetting front are key variables for a subsurface irrigation system design lamm and trooien 2003 many methods have been developed in efforts to elucidate the movement and distribution of soil water during subsurface irrigation numerical simulation is one of the most accurate and reliable means cai et al 2019 naik et al 2008 wang et al 2019 and hydrus 2d is the most widely used tool for predicting water movement in two dimensional variably saturated porous media simunek et al 2018 in addition water movement under subsurface irrigation conditions has been accurately simulated in various studies kacimov et al 2018 wang et al 2019 it could therefore potentially assist the selection of appropriate sice technical parameters and optimization of irrigation in apple orchards however few studies have assessed the validity of hydrus 2d 3d simulations for apple orchards arbat et al 2008 hardie 2017 hardie et al 2018 nazari et al 2021 and there are a limited number of previously published assessments of its utility for simulating water dynamics associated with sice in apple orchards thus the objectives of this study are 1 to validate the hydrus 2d for this purpose 2 to study the effects of the event and annual scale precipitation wet normal and dry and ceramic hydraulic conductivity of emitter chc on soil water dynamics and 3 to identify key criteria for optimal sice scheduling on clp 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment the experimental site was an apple orchard in a modern agricultural demonstration park 110 02 30 e 37 27 07 n 957 m above sea level in zizhou county yulin in the northern region of loess plateau china the soil in the orchard is silt loam 78 54 sand 20 82 silt and 0 64 clay with 1 38 g cm 3 bulk density the study area has a monsoon climate with 428 mm annual average precipitation 60 70 which falls in the summer july september in the summer months the weather is extremely hot while in winter it is mild and slightly windy with a frost free period of approximately 145 days the mean annual pan evaporation is 1087 7 mm daily precipitations and data on the other climate variables were acquired from a weather station established at the test site to compute reference crop evapotranspiration et0 according to the fao penman monteith model the daily et0 values obtained and precipitation in 2017 are shown in fig 1 in 2017 an irrigation experiment was conducted the apple trees were irrigated by a sice system cai et al 2021 with one lateral placed on one side of each row of trees 90 cm from the row laterals had ceramic emitters ce with 200 cm spacing the sice system continuously supplied irrigation water to the apple trees from the bud burst stage through to fruit maturity with a working pressure head of 20 50 cm three kinds of ceramic emitters designated dl dm and dh with 0 017 0 034 and 0 077 m d 1 hydraulic conductivity chc respectively were used in the experiments table 1 soil water content swc was measured at 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm depths using a trime pico iph time domain reflectometry tdr downhole sensor imko germany after site specific calibration three 120 cm long access tubes were installed 10 20 and 70 cm far from a randomly selected tree and swc and temperature values were obtained from 18 points in the soil around them fig 2 in total 18 swcs and temperature values across the soil profile were obtained for each measurement the canopy hemispherical photographs of apple trees were taken using winscanopy canopy analysis system winscanopy 2014a regent quebec canada measurements were done every 10 d leaf area index lai was calculated by winscanopy 2014a regent instruments ste foy quebec moreover the relationship between lai and time in the plots were determined by non linear regression with the equation presented by richards 1959 and the daily leaf area index can be obtained by interpolation in the fitting equation 1 l a i 1 82 1 32331 90 e 0 10 d o y 1 4 87 where doy is the day after apple bud burst 2 2 the hydrus 2d model and scenario analysis 2 2 1 model description water seepage from the ceramic emitters into the soil in the plots during the study period was simulated with the hydrus 2 03 software simunek et al 2018 assuming that the soil was homogeneous and isotropic only one ceramic emitter was used as a cylindrical source of water under each treatment treating the water movement during the infiltration process as an axisymmetrical process 2 θ t 1 r r rk h h r z k h h z k h z s h where θ is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 t is time d r and z are the radial and vertical positive upward spatial coordinates respectively cm k h is the hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 and s h is a sink term representing root water uptake a soil profile of depth z 100 cm was used in the simulations because the active layer for apple tree root systems in the study site was about 100 cm the horizontal radius was more than 150 cm huo et al 2021 the simulations were conducted by considering a soil profile with width r 100 cm and a ceramic emitter placed at 40 cm depth on the plane of symmetry the geometry and boundary conditions defining the physical problem in the simulations are shown in fig 2 2 2 2 model parameterization 2 2 2 1 soil hydraulic properties the soil water content and hydraulic conductivity k h are described by the analytical functions of van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 as follows 3 θ h θ r θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 4 k h k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 5 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where s e is the effective saturation k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated soil water contents cm3 cm 3 respectively α is an empirical parameter cm l approximately equal to the inverse of the air entry value n and m are the van genuchten mualem shape parameters the initial inputs of θ r α and n were estimated from the pedotransfer functions based on soil texture and bulk density using the rosetta package schaap et al 2001 embedded in hydrus 2d the saturated soil water content θ s of the soil was measured by the oven drying method the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was measured by the falling head method in the laboratory the soil hydraulic properties parameters were set as test values and are shown in table 1 2 2 2 2 root water uptake the spatial root distribution was defined in hydrus 2d according to vrugt et al 2001 however as the flow domain was based on the position of the ceramic emitter as the axis of symmetry in this study we assume that there was no difference in the distribution of roots in the horizontal direction 6 β z 1 z z m e p z z m z z z 0 where z m is the maximum depth of the root zone cm z is the location of the maximum root water uptake from the soil surface in the vertical direction p z is an empirical coefficient according to guo et al 2021 the proportion of fine apple roots in the 0 100 cm soil layer is approximately 80 and most root activity is within the 20 60 cm soil layer on clp based on these findings and empirical data we obtained in similar studies we defined the following key apple root water uptake parameters for the modeling z m 100 cm z 40 cm p z 0 5 the reduction of root water uptake due to water stress α 1 h was described using the linear relationship developed by feddes et al 1978 7 α 1 h 0 h h 1 o r h h 4 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 h h 1 1 h 3 h h 2 h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 2 h h 1 where h 1 h 2 h 3 and h 4 are the threshold parameters the following parameters taken from zheng et al 2018 were used for this modeling h 1 10 h 2 25 h 3 500 to 800 h 4 8000 cm 2 2 2 3 initial and boundary conditions the irrigation of the apple trees started on 18 may a total of 18 swc values across the soil profile were measured before irrigation therefore the average value of 18 swcs 0 14 cm3 cm 3 was set as the initial condition the water content values were converted into soil pressure head using eq 3 with parameter values listed in table 1 yielding a value of 1 291 m in each case the ceramic emitter is initially saturated so its initial water contents are set at the saturated water content the ceramic emitter s internal boundary nodes are assigned constant pressure head values 0 2 m which are identical to the pressure head values implemented in the field experiment free drainage and atmospheric boundary conditions are set for the bottom and surface boundary conditions respectively no flux conditions are assumed at the boundaries for water transport on the left and right sides of the flow domain 2 2 2 4 estimation of potential evaporation and transpiration hydrus 2d requires potential evaporation and transpiration values as input parameters but cannot directly calculate these parameters from meteorological data thus daily values of potential evaporation and transpiration for apple trees were estimated in this study using the fao 56 single crop coefficient approach allen 1998 first crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated using the following equation 8 e t c k c a c e t 0 where k c is the crop coefficient and a c is the ground cover reduction coefficient because of the bare soil surface and compact tree size ac was assumed to be 0 75 lo bianco and francaviglia 2012 k c was adjusted to be 0 5 in april 0 75 in may 1 0 in june and july 0 9 in august 0 75 in september and 0 6 in october based on soil management and calculated climatic conditions during those months wang et al 2020 secondly for hydrus 2d model input crop evapotranspiration etc was converted to potential evaporation rate ep and potential transpiration rate tp kool et al 2014 ritchie 1972 9 e p e t c e r l a i 10 t p e t c e p here r is the light extinction coefficient poblete echeverria et al 2015 reported the r values of 0 793 and 0 553 for ultra red gala and cripp s pink apples respectively therefore the r value of 0 7 was chosen for this study the daily potential transpiration and soil evaporation values obtained in this manner fig 1b were used as time variable boundary conditions in the model along with the precipitation recorded at the site 2 2 3 scenario analysis nine scenarios combinations of three types of meteorological conditions and three chc were established to predict the effects of meteorological and irrigation factors on soil water distribution water use efficiency and other important irrigation parameters table 2 to cover close to the full range of meteorological conditions at the study site we analyzed meteorological data covering 60 years recorded at the suide national weather station 20 km from the experimental site we defined years with cumulative probabilities of precipitation of 25 50 and 75 as wet normal and dry years respectively fig 3 we then used meteorological data recorded in three years with precipitation in these ranges 2010 dry 355 mm 2006 normal 435 mm and 2018 wet 513 mm in the simulations in combinations with three chc values 0 0168 m d dl 0 0336 m d dm and 0 077 m d dh apple trees started budding on 01 04 and were harvested on 15 09 at the trial site in the simulation we assumed lai of the dry normal and wet years changed over time in each year and the trends were the same as 2017 but between years we assumed that lai soil physical properties fertility are the same the calculated tp and ep values are shown in fig 4 2 2 4 evaluation of model performance due to the experimental deployment the soil moisture data collection began on 18 05 2017 at the study site therefore in this numerical simulation the simulation periods lasted 120 validation days from 18 5 15 9 root mean square error rmse and the efficiency index nse were calculated to compare the experimental and predicted swc values using the following equations 11 r m s e 1 n i 1 n o i s i 2 12 n s e 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o i and s i are measured and simulated values for an output variable respectively n is the number of observations and o is the mean of the observed data 3 results 3 1 model validation swcs simulated at 0 100 cm soil depths and corresponding measurements in the apple orchard during the validation year 2017 are presented in fig 5 the simulated and measured swc values were consistent especially in the 60 days following the apple budding period effects of precipitation on soil water content were also accurately simulated indicating that temporal variations in soil water recharge and consumption were adequately captured the nse and rmse values of differences between the simulated swc values in the 2017 dl 2017 dm and 2017 dh scenarios and corresponding measurements are shown for validation in table 3 the rmse values were about 0 02 cm3 cm 3 and although low chc was more accurately modeled than high chc the minimum nse was 0 899 clearly indicating that the simulated swc values agreed well with the measurements thus we conclude that the hydrus 2d can adequately simulate soil water contents of the apple orchard at our study site under sice 3 2 comparison of emitter discharge in the nine simulation scenarios as shown in fig 6 chc significantly affected its discharge in the soil the discharge gradually declined with some fluctuation from the initial rate to a stable level as irrigation proceeded and increased with increases in the chc for example in the normal year 2006 the stable discharge rates were 0 099 and 0 017 l h 1 at chc of 0 292 and 0 077 m d 1 respectively relationships between the stable discharge emitter discharge in the air and chc are shown in fig 7 the emitter discharge was significantly lower in the soil than in the air so soil inhibited outflow from the emitter for example for the emitter with a chc of 0 034 m d 1 the discharge rate was 0 257 l h 1 in the air but only about 0 166 l h 1 in the soil in addition we detected a quadratic relation between stable discharge and chc the soil s inhibitory effect on emitter outflow increased and steady outflow into the soil declined with increases in chc for example the outflow was 22 7 and 49 7 lower in soil than in air with chc of 0 017 and 0 077 m d 1 respectively thus the stable flow was only half the discharge rate in air due to the soil s inhibitory effect with the highest chc therefore when designing a sice system the steady discharge in the soil should be considered rather than the discharge in air as illustrated in fig 7 the data also showed that precipitation could cause a reduction in emitter discharge fig 6 for example in 2010 the dry year there was a single 59 6 mm precipitation event during a 143 day period which reduced discharge of the low medium and high chc by 7 59 5 54 and 6 45 respectively when the rainfall stopped after about four days in each case the flow returned to the stable discharge rate in the dry and normal years precipitation only slightly affected emitter discharge when it was less than 20 mm but 20 mm of precipitation significantly affected the emitter discharge in the wet year in addition the sensitivity of the emitter discharge greater to precipitation was positively related to its chc for example 18 5 mm of precipitation on day 41 in 2006 had very little effect on the outflow of the dl emitter but a stronger effect on the outflow of the dh emitter the main reason for variations in emitter discharge may be changes in swc as for instance high precipitation sharply increased the swc and reduced the discharge rates fig 6 more generally the higher the swc the lower the emitter discharge 3 3 comparison of swcs in the nine scenarios as shown in fig 8 the swc values declined with fluctuations to 0 10 0 20 cm3 cm 3 before the rainy season which started in late july or early august in both dry and normal years precipitation effectively replenishes the soil water in rainy seasons so the swc values increased in them and in wet years they remained high in the range 0 15 0 25 cm3 cm 3 chc also significantly affected the average swc for example the average swc averaged over time and space was 0 154 and 0 191 cm3 cm 3 with emitter hydraulic conductivities of 0 017 and 0 077 m d 1 respectively in 2010 although 2010 and 2006 were dry and normal years respectively the difference in their average swcs was relatively small this was mainly because most of the precipitation 142 mm occurred after day 145 in 2006 accounting for 39 4 of the entire growing season which led to an increase in swc in the later stages however the precipitation in the early stages was closer to that of 2010 150 7 and 113 9 mm from 1 4 30 7 in 2006 and 2010 respectively so swc values did not significantly differ between these two years precipitation and chc also strongly affected the duration of the minimum swc levels fig 8 in the 2010 dl and 2010 dh scenarios the minimum swc periods were days 85 165 and days 110 165 respectively however in the 2018 dh scenario it was very short and the minimum value was higher than 0 08 cm3 cm 3 the soil moisture distributions in the soil profile when the average swc was minimal during the growing seasons are presented in fig 9 precipitation and chc significantly affected soil moisture distribution and both were positively related to the size of the soil wetting zone the distribution of swc values in the areas affected by outflow of the emitter also significantly differed in several ways first the swc at the soil surface generally remained low with a 40 cm sice emitter and was essentially the residual swc second the swc declined with increases in distance from the emitter generally swcs were lowest at 100 cm depth and 100 cm from the emitter because points that far from an emitter with low hydraulic conductivity receive little irrigation water and only receive significant replenishing water during and after extreme precipitation events however the size and shape of the wetting zone formed by the ceramic emitter may also be influenced by precipitation and chc results of analysis of variance anova of swc at the 18 observation points under the treatments show that precipitation significantly affected it at all observation points table 4 chc had no significant effect on swcs at observation points 7 13 and 14 this is mainly because they were far from the emitter and above the level of the emitter so irrigation water would only reach them if the emitter had higher hydraulic conductivity however the interaction between precipitation and emitter hydraulic conductivity had no significant effect on swc at most of the observation points especially in those close to the emitter this may be because swc is more stable at points close to the emitter due to its adaptive regulation however the interaction between precipitation and chc significantly affected swc at observation points 9 10 11 and 12 which are lower than the emitter and at intermediate distances from it to further illustrate the effect of interaction between precipitation and hydraulic conductivity on swc changes in its standard deviation sd swc with time during the 168 day growth season are presented in fig 10 precipitation and evaporation affected surface soil moisture so sd swc was much higher in the soil surface layer than in other areas and positively related to distance from the emitter hydraulic conductivity was positively correlated with the area of small sd swc sd swc was large in 2010 mainly due to a large amount of precipitation in the late stages of the growing season which strongly increased the swc and hence sdswc across the profiles throughout the growing season as shown in table 5 and fig 10 the sice system allowed the swcs in a zone close to the emitter to remain stable and the size of the zone was positively related to the hydraulic conductivity for example the area with a small sd swcs was a cone of 80 cm height and 80 cm radius under the 2018 dl treatment and a cone of 85 cm height and 105 cm radius under the 2018 dm treatment with higher hydraulic conductivity 3 4 the relationship between swc and emitter discharge we detected a complementary relationship between emitter discharge and swc fig 6 and the change in swc was the main reason for the emitter discharge swc values across the profile rapidly increased when heavy rain occurred and thus the emitter discharge decreased however the emitter discharge did not significantly change during the period that swc values were low from 1 4 31 7 due to low precipitation the swc values in the wetted body were low but swc around the emitter was not significantly reduced and remained close to the saturation water content therefore the emitter discharge remained stable however across the entire soil profile swc increased during heavy rainfall especially around the emitter and could reach the saturation level allowing a positive pressure zone to form thus it had a stronger inhibitory effect on the emitter outflow nevertheless this inhibited the flow by less than 10 and the detectable effect lasted at most 5 days so as the emitter discharge was less than 0 3 l h 1 it may have had a minor effect on irrigation volumes 3 5 evaporation deep drainage and irrigation volume amounts of water entering the simulated area and consumption during the growing season are tabulated in table 5 precipitation slightly affected the irrigation volume and there was a significant positive correlation among chc irrigation volume and deep percolation precipitation and chc slightly affected evaporation but evaporation losses accounted for around 40 of the total water in the soil profile effects of precipitation and hydraulic conductivity on the deep percolation were relatively large deep percolation was positively related to chc especially under the treatment with the highest chc in which about 30 of the irrigation water reached the deepest soil in the profile therefore mulching measurements should be applied to reduce evaporation in addition a sice system could be stopped to reduce deep percolation when the rainy season starts on day 140 120 and 90 in dry normal and wet years respectively on clp and precipitation can meet apple trees growth needs determining the optimal time to stop irrigation in a given year may not be straightforward but data shown in fig 6 indicate that it could be stopped with little risk of much soil drying when the average swc exceeds 0 20 cm3 cm 3 after july 4 discussion 4 1 subsurface irrigation regimes emitter discharges of subsurface drip irrigation systems sdi are decreased by the development of positive pressure at the emitter outlet declines of 10 50 in sdi have been recorded by shani et al 1996 but just 2 10 for noncompensating emitters and less than 1 for compensating emitters in experiments by gil et al 2011 in addition nogueira et al 2021 only detected reductions in discharge from compensating emitters in a clay loam soil but reductions from noncompensating emitters in both a sandy loam and the clay loam soil these and other studies show that reductions in sdi emitter discharges are related to soil hydraulic properties emitter discharge rates and cavity radius both this study and various others cai et al 2017 kacimov et al 2018 lazarovitch et al 2006 also show that the steady discharge of sice emitters is slower in the air than in soil fig 7 if sdi regimes were steady state the emitter discharge would remain constant because of the positive pressure in the soil gil et al 2008 however negative pressure irrigation regimes or sice systems are quasi steady because water is emitted from these devices spontaneously and continuously to the soil cai et al 2021 kacimov and obnosov 2017 wang et al 2017 in our study swc rose sharply when there was strong precipitation resulting in significant reductions 5 8 in emitter discharge however the emitter discharge did not change significantly when the swc was low fig 6 therefore we believe that sice regimes would be steady state in dry periods similar to sdi regimes but emission would spontaneously and automatically decline when heavy rain occurred without human intervention through on off irrigation switches or controls 4 2 relationship between plant growth and soil water environment the use of si and sdi can effectively reduce irrigation volumes which could substantially reduce unnecessary evaporation losses table 5 bordovsky 2020 nalliah et al 2009 in recent years many scholars have also found that the use of si and sdi can improve crop yields and water use efficiency wue hunsaker et al 2000 jovanovic et al 2010 cai et al 2021 found that sice significantly improved apple yield wue and iwue by 7 6 14 8 and 6 5 respectively compared to sdi sice and npi supply water continuously according to water demand to maintain stable soil moisture in the root zone thereby avoiding changes in soil moisture impairing crop growth zhang et al 2021 moreover maintaining a constantly high swc can increase yields and phenolic contents of sweet basil nam et al 2020 constantly high soil water potential is important for the growth of maize particularly during flowering and pollination stages nesmith and ritchie 1992 song et al 2018a many irrigation systems have been developed to control swc accurately at a constant value hoffman et al 1996 such as soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation systems sms ais ortiz et al 2018 npi kacimov and obnosov 2017 and sice cai et al 2021 in sms ais soil moisture sensors are used to measure swc in real time and a control center applies the acquired data to regulate irrigation by switching solenoid valves but its cost is a major problem jimenez et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 various kinds of emitters often disks and or tubes made of ceramic or polyvinyl formal resin are used in npi and sice systems the difference between them is in the working pressure head and sice systems may be easier to install qi et al 2021 while npi may be more suitable for the cultivation of cash crops however sms ais and sice have potential utility in the field and the use of sice to maintain constant swc and thus obtain high crop yields will be a key focus of our future research 4 3 adaptability of rain fed and irrigation technology under climate change in clp in recent years numerous rain fed techniques have been applied in clp including rainwater collection and infiltration rwci song et al 2018b intercropping huo et al 2021 agroforestry zheng et al 2021 drip irrigation has been widely applied for water for fruit trees and various other crops but identifying ways to improve iwue may be crucial due to the high evaporation losses surge root irrigation is a big discharge subsurface irrigation method but its irrigation scheduling still requires more thorough study sice is easy to use and could maintain constant swc in the root zone thus increasing irrigation water use efficiency however emitter clogging in sice systems is a difficult problem that needs attention yao et al 2021 as can be seen from table 5 strong evapotranspiration causes high evaporative losses therefore various approaches are needed to reduce evaporation and increase infiltration of rainwater such as film mulching chen et al 2021 green manure intercropping miyazawa et al 2010 and improving the soil by biochar application wu et al 2019 moreover appropriate combinations of irrigation and soil improvement techniques may be essential for securing food production on clp in the future 5 conclusions the presented results indicate that hydrus 2d can be used to accurately simulate the soil water contents and distributions in apple orchards under sice on clp they also show that precipitation and the hydraulic conductivity of ceramic emitters significantly affect these variables moreover the feedback effects of swc on the system can modulate emitter discharge within a range of around 10 of the average rate sice can provide a zone with stable soil moisture for apple trees and the size of the zone is positively related to the emitter s hydraulic conductivity when designing a sice system the steady discharge in the soil should be used rather than the emitter discharge in the air apple trees could be continuously irrigated by sice until july and the irrigation could stop when the soil water content is higher than 0 20 cm3 cm 3 after july on clp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9350,china s loess plateau is the optimal and largest region of growing apple trees in the world subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitters sice is an energy efficient and water saving approach for fruit trees in arid and semi arid regions climate change which is shifting annual precipitation regimes is challenging the existing irrigation scheduling however little is known about how annual precipitation change affect the irrigation scheduling with sice therefore simulations with hydrus 2d and validation experiments in apple orchard were used to study the effects of the event and annual scale precipitation and ceramic hydraulic conductivity of emitter chc on soil water dynamics results indicated that annul precipitation slightly affected the irrigation volume however precipitation events had a significant effect on emitter discharge the outflow was 22 7 and 49 7 lower in soil than in air with chc of 0 017 and 0 077 m d 1 there was a significant positive correlation among chc irrigation volume and deep percolation precipitation and chc both have a significant effect on the soil water content in apple orchards the average swcs of wet year were 17 8 24 7 higher than normal

apple trees in different precipitation years apple trees could be continuously irrigated by sice until july and irrigation could be stopped when the average swc exceeds 0 20 cm3 cm 3 after july in

irrigation apple data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction china s loess plateau clp is the optimal and largest region of apple plantations in the world due to its high variation of diurnal temperature abundant sunshine and thick unsaturated soils yang et al 2020 by the year of 2017 the area of apple orchards has reached 1 3 million ha and annual apple production has exceeded 23 million tons accounting for about 25 of global totals in both area and output gao et al 2021 however the annual precipitation of the regions of cultivating apple trees generally ranges from 450 to 650 mm and mainly occurs in late summer and early autumn therefore these regions often suffer drought from april to early july which greatly affects the blossoming and bearing fruit climate change which is shifting annual precipitation regimes is challenging the existing irrigation scheduling therefore it is pressing to determine the optimal irrigation schedule which should be adapted to climate change to support the sustainability of apple orchards in drylands water saving irrigation technology offers effective ways to improve the utilization of water resources provenzano et al 2014 and thus propose the potential solutions to these problems in recent years many new water saving irrigation technologies have been demonstrated and applied in clp such as subsurface drip irrigation surge root irrigation and subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitters sice cai et al 2021 wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2009 sice is a type of subsurface irrigation that involves gradually supplying water from a source directly to the root area using a capillary medium abioye et al 2020 emission of moisture is driven by the capillary suction of relatively dry soil and thirsty roots in just right quantities spontaneously and continuously with no electronic or mechanical controls cai et al 2018 kacimov and obnosov 2017 however the application of sice on the plateau is currently very limited cai et al 2021 partly because sice systems are more complex than surface irrigation systems and hence more difficult to manage and maintain camp 1998 moreover there is insufficient understanding of sice technology and a better understanding of relevant fundamental theories and technical parameters is required one of the problems is that few studies have addressed the optimal parameters such as emitter discharge and irrigation duration for field application and they cannot be well defined currently gil et al 2008 patel and rajput 2007 wang et al 2021 to identify the optimal technical parameters of any irrigation system it is essential to understand the water dynamics during irrigation especially under climate change the size and distribution of the wetting front are key variables for a subsurface irrigation system design lamm and trooien 2003 many methods have been developed in efforts to elucidate the movement and distribution of soil water during subsurface irrigation numerical simulation is one of the most accurate and reliable means cai et al 2019 naik et al 2008 wang et al 2019 and hydrus 2d is the most widely used tool for predicting water movement in two dimensional variably saturated porous media simunek et al 2018 in addition water movement under subsurface irrigation conditions has been accurately simulated in various studies kacimov et al 2018 wang et al 2019 it could therefore potentially assist the selection of appropriate sice technical parameters and optimization of irrigation in apple orchards however few studies have assessed the validity of hydrus 2d 3d simulations for apple orchards arbat et al 2008 hardie 2017 hardie et al 2018 nazari et al 2021 and there are a limited number of previously published assessments of its utility for simulating water dynamics associated with sice in apple orchards thus the objectives of this study are 1 to validate the hydrus 2d for this purpose 2 to study the effects of the event and annual scale precipitation wet normal and dry and ceramic hydraulic conductivity of emitter chc on soil water dynamics and 3 to identify key criteria for optimal sice scheduling on clp 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment the experimental site was an apple orchard in a modern agricultural demonstration park 110 02 30 e 37 27 07 n 957 m above sea level in zizhou county yulin in the northern region of loess plateau china the soil in the orchard is silt loam 78 54 sand 20 82 silt and 0 64 clay with 1 38 g cm 3 bulk density the study area has a monsoon climate with 428 mm annual average precipitation 60 70 which falls in the summer july september in the summer months the weather is extremely hot while in winter it is mild and slightly windy with a frost free period of approximately 145 days the mean annual pan evaporation is 1087 7 mm daily precipitations and data on the other climate variables were acquired from a weather station established at the test site to compute reference crop evapotranspiration et0 according to the fao penman monteith model the daily et0 values obtained and precipitation in 2017 are shown in fig 1 in 2017 an irrigation experiment was conducted the apple trees were irrigated by a sice system cai et al 2021 with one lateral placed on one side of each row of trees 90 cm from the row laterals had ceramic emitters ce with 200 cm spacing the sice system continuously supplied irrigation water to the apple trees from the bud burst stage through to fruit maturity with a working pressure head of 20 50 cm three kinds of ceramic emitters designated dl dm and dh with 0 017 0 034 and 0 077 m d 1 hydraulic conductivity chc respectively were used in the experiments table 1 soil water content swc was measured at 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm depths using a trime pico iph time domain reflectometry tdr downhole sensor imko germany after site specific calibration three 120 cm long access tubes were installed 10 20 and 70 cm far from a randomly selected tree and swc and temperature values were obtained from 18 points in the soil around them fig 2 in total 18 swcs and temperature values across the soil profile were obtained for each measurement the canopy hemispherical photographs of apple trees were taken using winscanopy canopy analysis system winscanopy 2014a regent quebec canada measurements were done every 10 d leaf area index lai was calculated by winscanopy 2014a regent instruments ste foy quebec moreover the relationship between lai and time in the plots were determined by non linear regression with the equation presented by richards 1959 and the daily leaf area index can be obtained by interpolation in the fitting equation 1 l a i 1 82 1 32331 90 e 0 10 d o y 1 4 87 where doy is the day after apple bud burst 2 2 the hydrus 2d model and scenario analysis 2 2 1 model description water seepage from the ceramic emitters into the soil in the plots during the study period was simulated with the hydrus 2 03 software simunek et al 2018 assuming that the soil was homogeneous and isotropic only one ceramic emitter was used as a cylindrical source of water under each treatment treating the water movement during the infiltration process as an axisymmetrical process 2 θ t 1 r r rk h h r z k h h z k h z s h where θ is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 t is time d r and z are the radial and vertical positive upward spatial coordinates respectively cm k h is the hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 and s h is a sink term representing root water uptake a soil profile of depth z 100 cm was used in the simulations because the active layer for apple tree root systems in the study site was about 100 cm the horizontal radius was more than 150 cm huo et al 2021 the simulations were conducted by considering a soil profile with width r 100 cm and a ceramic emitter placed at 40 cm depth on the plane of symmetry the geometry and boundary conditions defining the physical problem in the simulations are shown in fig 2 2 2 2 model parameterization 2 2 2 1 soil hydraulic properties the soil water content and hydraulic conductivity k h are described by the analytical functions of van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 as follows 3 θ h θ r θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 4 k h k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 5 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where s e is the effective saturation k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated soil water contents cm3 cm 3 respectively α is an empirical parameter cm l approximately equal to the inverse of the air entry value n and m are the van genuchten mualem shape parameters the initial inputs of θ r α and n were estimated from the pedotransfer functions based on soil texture and bulk density using the rosetta package schaap et al 2001 embedded in hydrus 2d the saturated soil water content θ s of the soil was measured by the oven drying method the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was measured by the falling head method in the laboratory the soil hydraulic properties parameters were set as test values and are shown in table 1 2 2 2 2 root water uptake the spatial root distribution was defined in hydrus 2d according to vrugt et al 2001 however as the flow domain was based on the position of the ceramic emitter as the axis of symmetry in this study we assume that there was no difference in the distribution of roots in the horizontal direction 6 β z 1 z z m e p z z m z z z 0 where z m is the maximum depth of the root zone cm z is the location of the maximum root water uptake from the soil surface in the vertical direction p z is an empirical coefficient according to guo et al 2021 the proportion of fine apple roots in the 0 100 cm soil layer is approximately 80 and most root activity is within the 20 60 cm soil layer on clp based on these findings and empirical data we obtained in similar studies we defined the following key apple root water uptake parameters for the modeling z m 100 cm z 40 cm p z 0 5 the reduction of root water uptake due to water stress α 1 h was described using the linear relationship developed by feddes et al 1978 7 α 1 h 0 h h 1 o r h h 4 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 h h 1 1 h 3 h h 2 h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 2 h h 1 where h 1 h 2 h 3 and h 4 are the threshold parameters the following parameters taken from zheng et al 2018 were used for this modeling h 1 10 h 2 25 h 3 500 to 800 h 4 8000 cm 2 2 2 3 initial and boundary conditions the irrigation of the apple trees started on 18 may a total of 18 swc values across the soil profile were measured before irrigation therefore the average value of 18 swcs 0 14 cm3 cm 3 was set as the initial condition the water content values were converted into soil pressure head using eq 3 with parameter values listed in table 1 yielding a value of 1 291 m in each case the ceramic emitter is initially saturated so its initial water contents are set at the saturated water content the ceramic emitter s internal boundary nodes are assigned constant pressure head values 0 2 m which are identical to the pressure head values implemented in the field experiment free drainage and atmospheric boundary conditions are set for the bottom and surface boundary conditions respectively no flux conditions are assumed at the boundaries for water transport on the left and right sides of the flow domain 2 2 2 4 estimation of potential evaporation and transpiration hydrus 2d requires potential evaporation and transpiration values as input parameters but cannot directly calculate these parameters from meteorological data thus daily values of potential evaporation and transpiration for apple trees were estimated in this study using the fao 56 single crop coefficient approach allen 1998 first crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated using the following equation 8 e t c k c a c e t 0 where k c is the crop coefficient and a c is the ground cover reduction coefficient because of the bare soil surface and compact tree size ac was assumed to be 0 75 lo bianco and francaviglia 2012 k c was adjusted to be 0 5 in april 0 75 in may 1 0 in june and july 0 9 in august 0 75 in september and 0 6 in october based on soil management and calculated climatic conditions during those months wang et al 2020 secondly for hydrus 2d model input crop evapotranspiration etc was converted to potential evaporation rate ep and potential transpiration rate tp kool et al 2014 ritchie 1972 9 e p e t c e r l a i 10 t p e t c e p here r is the light extinction coefficient poblete echeverria et al 2015 reported the r values of 0 793 and 0 553 for ultra red gala and cripp s pink apples respectively therefore the r value of 0 7 was chosen for this study the daily potential transpiration and soil evaporation values obtained in this manner fig 1b were used as time variable boundary conditions in the model along with the precipitation recorded at the site 2 2 3 scenario analysis nine scenarios combinations of three types of meteorological conditions and three chc were established to predict the effects of meteorological and irrigation factors on soil water distribution water use efficiency and other important irrigation parameters table 2 to cover close to the full range of meteorological conditions at the study site we analyzed meteorological data covering 60 years recorded at the suide national weather station 20 km from the experimental site we defined years with cumulative probabilities of precipitation of 25 50 and 75 as wet normal and dry years respectively fig 3 we then used meteorological data recorded in three years with precipitation in these ranges 2010 dry 355 mm 2006 normal 435 mm and 2018 wet 513 mm in the simulations in combinations with three chc values 0 0168 m d dl 0 0336 m d dm and 0 077 m d dh apple trees started budding on 01 04 and were harvested on 15 09 at the trial site in the simulation we assumed lai of the dry normal and wet years changed over time in each year and the trends were the same as 2017 but between years we assumed that lai soil physical properties fertility are the same the calculated tp and ep values are shown in fig 4 2 2 4 evaluation of model performance due to the experimental deployment the soil moisture data collection began on 18 05 2017 at the study site therefore in this numerical simulation the simulation periods lasted 120 validation days from 18 5 15 9 root mean square error rmse and the efficiency index nse were calculated to compare the experimental and predicted swc values using the following equations 11 r m s e 1 n i 1 n o i s i 2 12 n s e 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o i and s i are measured and simulated values for an output variable respectively n is the number of observations and o is the mean of the observed data 3 results 3 1 model validation swcs simulated at 0 100 cm soil depths and corresponding measurements in the apple orchard during the validation year 2017 are presented in fig 5 the simulated and measured swc values were consistent especially in the 60 days following the apple budding period effects of precipitation on soil water content were also accurately simulated indicating that temporal variations in soil water recharge and consumption were adequately captured the nse and rmse values of differences between the simulated swc values in the 2017 dl 2017 dm and 2017 dh scenarios and corresponding measurements are shown for validation in table 3 the rmse values were about 0 02 cm3 cm 3 and although low chc was more accurately modeled than high chc the minimum nse was 0 899 clearly indicating that the simulated swc values agreed well with the measurements thus we conclude that the hydrus 2d can adequately simulate soil water contents of the apple orchard at our study site under sice 3 2 comparison of emitter discharge in the nine simulation scenarios as shown in fig 6 chc significantly affected its discharge in the soil the discharge gradually declined with some fluctuation from the initial rate to a stable level as irrigation proceeded and increased with increases in the chc for example in the normal year 2006 the stable discharge rates were 0 099 and 0 017 l h 1 at chc of 0 292 and 0 077 m d 1 respectively relationships between the stable discharge emitter discharge in the air and chc are shown in fig 7 the emitter discharge was significantly lower in the soil than in the air so soil inhibited outflow from the emitter for example for the emitter with a chc of 0 034 m d 1 the discharge rate was 0 257 l h 1 in the air but only about 0 166 l h 1 in the soil in addition we detected a quadratic relation between stable discharge and chc the soil s inhibitory effect on emitter outflow increased and steady outflow into the soil declined with increases in chc for example the outflow was 22 7 and 49 7 lower in soil than in air with chc of 0 017 and 0 077 m d 1 respectively thus the stable flow was only half the discharge rate in air due to the soil s inhibitory effect with the highest chc therefore when designing a sice system the steady discharge in the soil should be considered rather than the discharge in air as illustrated in fig 7 the data also showed that precipitation could cause a reduction in emitter discharge fig 6 for example in 2010 the dry year there was a single 59 6 mm precipitation event during a 143 day period which reduced discharge of the low medium and high chc by 7 59 5 54 and 6 45 respectively when the rainfall stopped after about four days in each case the flow returned to the stable discharge rate in the dry and normal years precipitation only slightly affected emitter discharge when it was less than 20 mm but 20 mm of precipitation significantly affected the emitter discharge in the wet year in addition the sensitivity of the emitter discharge greater to precipitation was positively related to its chc for example 18 5 mm of precipitation on day 41 in 2006 had very little effect on the outflow of the dl emitter but a stronger effect on the outflow of the dh emitter the main reason for variations in emitter discharge may be changes in swc as for instance high precipitation sharply increased the swc and reduced the discharge rates fig 6 more generally the higher the swc the lower the emitter discharge 3 3 comparison of swcs in the nine scenarios as shown in fig 8 the swc values declined with fluctuations to 0 10 0 20 cm3 cm 3 before the rainy season which started in late july or early august in both dry and normal years precipitation effectively replenishes the soil water in rainy seasons so the swc values increased in them and in wet years they remained high in the range 0 15 0 25 cm3 cm 3 chc also significantly affected the average swc for example the average swc averaged over time and space was 0 154 and 0 191 cm3 cm 3 with emitter hydraulic conductivities of 0 017 and 0 077 m d 1 respectively in 2010 although 2010 and 2006 were dry and normal years respectively the difference in their average swcs was relatively small this was mainly because most of the precipitation 142 mm occurred after day 145 in 2006 accounting for 39 4 of the entire growing season which led to an increase in swc in the later stages however the precipitation in the early stages was closer to that of 2010 150 7 and 113 9 mm from 1 4 30 7 in 2006 and 2010 respectively so swc values did not significantly differ between these two years precipitation and chc also strongly affected the duration of the minimum swc levels fig 8 in the 2010 dl and 2010 dh scenarios the minimum swc periods were days 85 165 and days 110 165 respectively however in the 2018 dh scenario it was very short and the minimum value was higher than 0 08 cm3 cm 3 the soil moisture distributions in the soil profile when the average swc was minimal during the growing seasons are presented in fig 9 precipitation and chc significantly affected soil moisture distribution and both were positively related to the size of the soil wetting zone the distribution of swc values in the areas affected by outflow of the emitter also significantly differed in several ways first the swc at the soil surface generally remained low with a 40 cm sice emitter and was essentially the residual swc second the swc declined with increases in distance from the emitter generally swcs were lowest at 100 cm depth and 100 cm from the emitter because points that far from an emitter with low hydraulic conductivity receive little irrigation water and only receive significant replenishing water during and after extreme precipitation events however the size and shape of the wetting zone formed by the ceramic emitter may also be influenced by precipitation and chc results of analysis of variance anova of swc at the 18 observation points under the treatments show that precipitation significantly affected it at all observation points table 4 chc had no significant effect on swcs at observation points 7 13 and 14 this is mainly because they were far from the emitter and above the level of the emitter so irrigation water would only reach them if the emitter had higher hydraulic conductivity however the interaction between precipitation and emitter hydraulic conductivity had no significant effect on swc at most of the observation points especially in those close to the emitter this may be because swc is more stable at points close to the emitter due to its adaptive regulation however the interaction between precipitation and chc significantly affected swc at observation points 9 10 11 and 12 which are lower than the emitter and at intermediate distances from it to further illustrate the effect of interaction between precipitation and hydraulic conductivity on swc changes in its standard deviation sd swc with time during the 168 day growth season are presented in fig 10 precipitation and evaporation affected surface soil moisture so sd swc was much higher in the soil surface layer than in other areas and positively related to distance from the emitter hydraulic conductivity was positively correlated with the area of small sd swc sd swc was large in 2010 mainly due to a large amount of precipitation in the late stages of the growing season which strongly increased the swc and hence sdswc across the profiles throughout the growing season as shown in table 5 and fig 10 the sice system allowed the swcs in a zone close to the emitter to remain stable and the size of the zone was positively related to the hydraulic conductivity for example the area with a small sd swcs was a cone of 80 cm height and 80 cm radius under the 2018 dl treatment and a cone of 85 cm height and 105 cm radius under the 2018 dm treatment with higher hydraulic conductivity 3 4 the relationship between swc and emitter discharge we detected a complementary relationship between emitter discharge and swc fig 6 and the change in swc was the main reason for the emitter discharge swc values across the profile rapidly increased when heavy rain occurred and thus the emitter discharge decreased however the emitter discharge did not significantly change during the period that swc values were low from 1 4 31 7 due to low precipitation the swc values in the wetted body were low but swc around the emitter was not significantly reduced and remained close to the saturation water content therefore the emitter discharge remained stable however across the entire soil profile swc increased during heavy rainfall especially around the emitter and could reach the saturation level allowing a positive pressure zone to form thus it had a stronger inhibitory effect on the emitter outflow nevertheless this inhibited the flow by less than 10 and the detectable effect lasted at most 5 days so as the emitter discharge was less than 0 3 l h 1 it may have had a minor effect on irrigation volumes 3 5 evaporation deep drainage and irrigation volume amounts of water entering the simulated area and consumption during the growing season are tabulated in table 5 precipitation slightly affected the irrigation volume and there was a significant positive correlation among chc irrigation volume and deep percolation precipitation and chc slightly affected evaporation but evaporation losses accounted for around 40 of the total water in the soil profile effects of precipitation and hydraulic conductivity on the deep percolation were relatively large deep percolation was positively related to chc especially under the treatment with the highest chc in which about 30 of the irrigation water reached the deepest soil in the profile therefore mulching measurements should be applied to reduce evaporation in addition a sice system could be stopped to reduce deep percolation when the rainy season starts on day 140 120 and 90 in dry normal and wet years respectively on clp and precipitation can meet apple trees growth needs determining the optimal time to stop irrigation in a given year may not be straightforward but data shown in fig 6 indicate that it could be stopped with little risk of much soil drying when the average swc exceeds 0 20 cm3 cm 3 after july 4 discussion 4 1 subsurface irrigation regimes emitter discharges of subsurface drip irrigation systems sdi are decreased by the development of positive pressure at the emitter outlet declines of 10 50 in sdi have been recorded by shani et al 1996 but just 2 10 for noncompensating emitters and less than 1 for compensating emitters in experiments by gil et al 2011 in addition nogueira et al 2021 only detected reductions in discharge from compensating emitters in a clay loam soil but reductions from noncompensating emitters in both a sandy loam and the clay loam soil these and other studies show that reductions in sdi emitter discharges are related to soil hydraulic properties emitter discharge rates and cavity radius both this study and various others cai et al 2017 kacimov et al 2018 lazarovitch et al 2006 also show that the steady discharge of sice emitters is slower in the air than in soil fig 7 if sdi regimes were steady state the emitter discharge would remain constant because of the positive pressure in the soil gil et al 2008 however negative pressure irrigation regimes or sice systems are quasi steady because water is emitted from these devices spontaneously and continuously to the soil cai et al 2021 kacimov and obnosov 2017 wang et al 2017 in our study swc rose sharply when there was strong precipitation resulting in significant reductions 5 8 in emitter discharge however the emitter discharge did not change significantly when the swc was low fig 6 therefore we believe that sice regimes would be steady state in dry periods similar to sdi regimes but emission would spontaneously and automatically decline when heavy rain occurred without human intervention through on off irrigation switches or controls 4 2 relationship between plant growth and soil water environment the use of si and sdi can effectively reduce irrigation volumes which could substantially reduce unnecessary evaporation losses table 5 bordovsky 2020 nalliah et al 2009 in recent years many scholars have also found that the use of si and sdi can improve crop yields and water use efficiency wue hunsaker et al 2000 jovanovic et al 2010 cai et al 2021 found that sice significantly improved apple yield wue and iwue by 7 6 14 8 and 6 5 respectively compared to sdi sice and npi supply water continuously according to water demand to maintain stable soil moisture in the root zone thereby avoiding changes in soil moisture impairing crop growth zhang et al 2021 moreover maintaining a constantly high swc can increase yields and phenolic contents of sweet basil nam et al 2020 constantly high soil water potential is important for the growth of maize particularly during flowering and pollination stages nesmith and ritchie 1992 song et al 2018a many irrigation systems have been developed to control swc accurately at a constant value hoffman et al 1996 such as soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation systems sms ais ortiz et al 2018 npi kacimov and obnosov 2017 and sice cai et al 2021 in sms ais soil moisture sensors are used to measure swc in real time and a control center applies the acquired data to regulate irrigation by switching solenoid valves but its cost is a major problem jimenez et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 various kinds of emitters often disks and or tubes made of ceramic or polyvinyl formal resin are used in npi and sice systems the difference between them is in the working pressure head and sice systems may be easier to install qi et al 2021 while npi may be more suitable for the cultivation of cash crops however sms ais and sice have potential utility in the field and the use of sice to maintain constant swc and thus obtain high crop yields will be a key focus of our future research 4 3 adaptability of rain fed and irrigation technology under climate change in clp in recent years numerous rain fed techniques have been applied in clp including rainwater collection and infiltration rwci song et al 2018b intercropping huo et al 2021 agroforestry zheng et al 2021 drip irrigation has been widely applied for water for fruit trees and various other crops but identifying ways to improve iwue may be crucial due to the high evaporation losses surge root irrigation is a big discharge subsurface irrigation method but its irrigation scheduling still requires more thorough study sice is easy to use and could maintain constant swc in the root zone thus increasing irrigation water use efficiency however emitter clogging in sice systems is a difficult problem that needs attention yao et al 2021 as can be seen from table 5 strong evapotranspiration causes high evaporative losses therefore various approaches are needed to reduce evaporation and increase infiltration of rainwater such as film mulching chen et al 2021 green manure intercropping miyazawa et al 2010 and improving the soil by biochar application wu et al 2019 moreover appropriate combinations of irrigation and soil improvement techniques may be essential for securing food production on clp in the future 5 conclusions the presented results indicate that hydrus 2d can be used to accurately simulate the soil water contents and distributions in apple orchards under sice on clp they also show that precipitation and the hydraulic conductivity of ceramic emitters significantly affect these variables moreover the feedback effects of swc on the system can modulate emitter discharge within a range of around 10 of the average rate sice can provide a zone with stable soil moisture for apple trees and the size of the zone is positively related to the emitter s hydraulic conductivity when designing a sice system the steady discharge in the soil should be used rather than the emitter discharge in the air apple trees could be continuously irrigated by sice until july and the irrigation could stop when the soil water content is higher than 0 20 cm3 cm 3 after july on clp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9351,the plastic mulched ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting prfrh planting practice is widely used in rain fed arid and semi arid areas however it remains unknown whether prfrh can replace or reduce irrigation to achieve a high and stable wheat yield in dry semi humid areas in this study two cultivation practices prfrh and conventional flat planting ck were used in combination with three irrigation regimes 0 75 and 150 mm to evaluate the efficacy of prfrh in different precipitation year types dry normal and wet years results showed that prfrh increased soil temperature and pre jointing soil water storage at 0 80 cm depth whereas irrigation increased post anthesis soil water storage at 0 80 cm depth furthermore prfrh prolonged the duration of the jointing anthesis stages and thereby increasing the kernel number both prfrh and irrigation increased dry matter accumulation and the leaf area index prfrh accelerated the grain filling rate but shortened the effective grain filling duration while irrigation extended the effective grain filling duration prfrh did not significantly influence kernel weight whereas irrigation increased kernel weight overall prfrh reduced the effective wheat planted area and thereby reducing spike number although it increased the kernel number resulting in yields that were 13 7 lower than those under ck the yield under prfrh was significantly higher than that under ck only in the dry year but lower in the normal and wet years irrigation increased the yield however the yield did not significantly differ between the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes the water productivity and net profit under 75 mm irrigation were relatively high in conclusion in dry semi humid areas prfrh combined with a 75 mm irrigation volume could mitigate drought stress to improve yield water productivity and net profit in dry years only keywords dry semi humid areas winter wheat plastic mulched ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting planting

approximately 1 35 billion km3 of water only 3 of freshwater resources can be used for drinking and agricultural irrigation ungureanu et al 2020 winpenny et al 2010 currently the global agricultural water consumption exceeds 2700 km3 accounting for approximately 70 of global freshwater with the increasing world population the demand for food has soared which in turn has led to an increase in the demand for agricultural water resources he et al 2021 by 2050 more than two thirds of the global population will have faced a water crisis because of excessive water consumption through agricultural production une 2015 moreover because of climate change extreme weather can have a substantial negative impact on the quality and availability of water resources which may further exacerbate global water scarcity by 20 fao 2016 with population growth and water shortage the primary problem that must be addressed to feed the increasing population is the development of methods for increasing food production based on existing water resources dry semi humid areas in north china cover more than 15 3 million hm2 and account for approximately 14 1 of china s grain yield and these areas are defined as zones with an annual precipitation of 500 600 mm and a dryness ratio of 1 3 1 6 annual evaporation vs annual precipitation li et al 2017 dry semi humid areas frequently experience drought stresses during crop growing seasons which tend to lower the crop yield and productivity the main cropping system currently used in these areas is winter wheat summer maize double cropping most precipitation occurs as rain during the summer maize growing period rainy season in july september because of the influence of the asian summer monsoon precipitation during the growing period of winter wheat is only about 100 200 mm while the water requirement of winter wheat is approximately 450 mm liu et al 2002 local farmers irrigate their winter wheat fields two to four times during the wheat growth period to increase yield with the total irrigation ranging from 165 to 440 mm li et al 2016 2019 however the irrigation water utilization rate and crop water production efficiency of conventional irrigation flood irrigation are 45 and 0 8 kg m 3 respectively resulting in a significant wastage of limited water resources xu et al 2003 in addition extensive irrigation of wheat has also caused a pronounced decline in groundwater levels resulting in a groundwater funnel situation feng et al 2013 therefore new ways must be established to improve water productivity and conserve water for efficient agriculture and long term agricultural development in dry semi arid areas with limited water resources various agronomic techniques have been utilized to improve dryland crop production in arid and semi arid areas ferrand and cecunjanin 2014 zhang et al 2018 for example the plastic mulched ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting prfrh planting practice is widely used worldwide gan et al 2013 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 mo et al 2017 it is considered a simple cost effective and innovative solution that can be used to increase food production in china it has improved crop yields and water use efficiency by 45 5 and 58 0 respectively and has contributed 3 0 107 metric tons of crop production sun et al 2020 this technique involves alternating ridges and furrows wherein plastic mulched ridges collect the runoff generated by precipitation and transfer it to un mulched planting furrows thus light precipitation exhibits a superposition effect consequently promoting precipitation infiltration and improving water use efficiency li et al 2017 prfrh ensures precipitation retention in soil reduces wasteful evaporation improves soil hydrothermal conditions and increases crop water use and yield which is one of the main strategies for saving water in arid and semi arid dryland areas gan et al 2013 crop yield depends on the synchronization of crop growth and precipitation mo et al 2017 ren et al 2009 droughts in spring and summer caused by the monsoon climate and the intensification of conflicts in water use have seriously decreased the yield of winter wheat in dry semi humid areas zhao et al 2020 hence irrigation is necessary to ensure sufficient wheat production however considering the effectiveness of prfrh in dryland agriculture studies have yet to clarify whether it can be applied to irrigated farmland systems to improve the water use efficiency of crops and thus reduce the amount of irrigation water used for crop production based on field experiments under varying annual precipitation i e dry normal and wet years this study investigated the effects of prfrh combined with irrigation on the growth of winter wheat and its effectiveness in minimizing water usage in dry and semi humid areas in china furthermore we sought to determine the potential role of prfrh in soil hydrothermal properties winter wheat growth and development grain yield and water resource use efficiency under irrigation conditions in dry semi humid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted during three wheat growing seasons 2015 2018 at the experimental station of northwest a f university 34 20 n 108 04 e in guanzhong plain in china fig 1 the guanzhong plain a typical dry semi humid region has relatively flat terrains and flourishing agriculture geng et al 2013 there are significant concerns about water resources in the guanzhong plain where more than 60 of total annual water resources are used for irrigation tang et al 2015 the intensive winter wheat summer maize double cropping system dominates agricultural production the soil is a eum orthic anthrosol chinses soil taxonomy the organic matter

conventional flat planting ck fig 1 for each practice three irrigation regimes i e 0 75 and 150 mm were used the experiment was laid out in a split plot design with planting practices in the main plot and irrigation regimes in the subplot each treatment was replicated thrice in plots that were 5 m long and 4 4 m wide fig 1 in this study the winter wheat summer maize cropping system was adopted during the summer maize growth season drought has less effect on maize therefore irrigation was not applied from this the study focused only on variables related to the winter wheat season 2 3 field management rotary tillage was applied before wheat sowing and 225 kg n ha 1 75 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 150 kg k2o ha 1 were applied as basal fertilizers for all treatments then the prfrh system was established fig 1 which consisted of alternating ridges 40 cm wide and 15 cm high and furrows 60 cm wide with a plastic film 0 008 mm thick mulched on the ridge wheat was planted in the furrows with a row spacing of 20 cm and a sowing rate of 225 kg ha 1 wheat seeds were sown on october 12 2015 october 4 2016 and october 18 2017 and the crops were harvested on june 5 2016 june 1 2017 and june 7 2018 according to the local irrigation system winter wheat was irrigated at the wintering average daily temperature below 3 4 c continuously and jointing first node of the stem visible at the base of the shoot stages the irrigation volume was split and applied equally during the two stages the edge of each plot was lined with a 2 m wide isolation belt to prevent water infiltration weeding and pest control were performed regularly during the growth period 2 4 sampling and laboratory analysis 2 4 1 wheat phenology phenological stages were recorded regularly using the zadoks phenological scale zadoks et al 1974 2 4 2 soil temperature and moisture automatic temperature probes were used to record the soil temperature daily at 5 cm soil depth soil moisture was measured using the oven drying method at different growth stages of winter wheat i e emergence z10 regreening z30 jointing z31 anthesis z60 milky ripe z75 and maturity z92 soil samples were obtained at 10 and 20 cm of 0 10 and 10 200 cm layers respectively soil water storage sws mm was calculated as follows 1 sws i n h i ρ i b i 10 ρ w where h cm is the soil layer depth ρ g cm 3 is the soil bulk density b is the soil water

accumulation were determined every 20 days from regreening to harvest the lai was calculated based on the ratio of the leaf length and leaf width midrib length maximum leaf width 0 75 m2 to the projected area m2 of the plant canopy for calculating dry matter accumulation the aboveground total biomass of two rows was oven dried at 105 c for 30 min and later at 75 c until the weights became constant at the anthesis stage 150 spikes with the same growing trend were selected and labeled in each plot ten labeled spikes were selected from each plot with a 3 day interval between anthesis and maturity a logistic growth curve was fitted to the grain dry weight data fig 2 liu et al 2020b as follows 2 w a 1 b e kt where w mg is the grain weight a mg is the final grain weight t days is the

precipitation m is the average annual precipitation and σ is the standard error for precipitation di is used to distinguish among the wet di 0 35 normal 0 35 di 0 35 and dry di 0 35 years the annual precipitation in 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 were 503 3 574 4 and 687 6 mm respectively fig 3 the average annual precipitation was 592 3 mm over a 40 year period provided by the climate data center of the china meteorological administration based on the di 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 were considered dry di 0 59 0 35 normal di 0 12 0 35 di 0 35 and wet di 0 64 0 35 years respectively 2 6 statistical analysis mixed effect models in r package lme4 bates et al 2015 were used to analyze how planting practices and irrigation regimes influenced sws and how precipitation year types planting practices and irrigation regimes influenced yield components grain yield and wp this experiment was conducted with a blocked split plot design and 1 block planting and 1 block year planting were chosen as random effects a pairwise tukey comparison was performed using the r software packages multcomp hothorn et al 2008 and emmeans lenth 2021 statistical significance was evaluated at p 0 05 and p 0 01 since anova can compare statistically significant differences between treatments but cannot assess effect size η2 recommended by bakeman 2005 was used as the calculated effect value to examine the effect sizes of treatments the effect values η2 of 0 3 0 3 0 5 and 0 5 were described as small medium and large respectively all statistical analyses were performed with r 4 1 0 using rstudio 2022 02 1 461 figures were generated using ggplot2 and originpro 2016 3 results 3 1 soil water storage the sws at the soil depth range of 0 200 cm in different treatments is shown in fig 4 both planting practices and irrigation regimes significantly affected sws at a soil depth of 0 80 cm p 0 05 at the soil depth of 0 40 cm the sws under prfrh was significantly higher than that under ck before the jointing stage p 0 05 the average sws under prfrh was 8 3 higher than that under ck during the emergence jointing stage additionally at the soil depth of 0 40 cm after the anthesis stage the sws under irrigation conditions was significantly higher than that under non irrigation conditions p 0 05 the average sws under the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regmimes were 10 5 and 15 7 higher than those under non irrigation conditions during the anthesis maturating stage respectively conversely no obvious differences were observed between the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes at the soil depth of 40 80 cm prfrh and irrigation also increased the pre jointing and post anthesis sws respectively prfrh had 8 7 higher pre jointing sws than ck the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes increased the post anthesis sws by 11 3 and 8 3 respectively compared with those under non irrigation conditions thus prfrh increased pre jointing sws but irrigation increased post anthesis sws the interannual variation in sws was large and the sws in the wet year was obviously higher than that in the normal and dry years especially at 80 200 cm soil depth the sws values in the normal and dry years were 21 4 and 26 9 lower than those in the wet year respectively at the emergence stage at a soil depth of 80 200 cm with increasing wheat growth the soil water consumption of deep soil increased especially in the dry and normal years furthermore irrigation reduced the deep soil water consumption of wheat and occurred later in the wheat growth period the average sws values at 80 200 cm soil depth under the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes were 5 2 and 9 0 higher than those under non irrigation conditions respectively while no obvious differences were observed between the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes however the effect of planting practices on deep soil sws was not significant p 0 05 3 2 soil temperature surface soil temperature analyses revealed that prfrh increased soil temperature fig 5 the soil temperature under prfrh was obviously higher than that under ck the average surface soil temperature under prfrh was 1 c higher than that under ck during the wheat growth period however the effect of irrigation regimes on soil temperature was not obvious 3 3 phenological stages planting practices and irrigation regimes altered the phenological stages of winter wheat table 1 the emergence and jointing stages under prfrh occurred 3 4 and 2 3 days earlier than those under ck respectively however the anthesis and maturity stages under prfrh occurred 1 2 days later than that under ck respectively therefore the duration of the jointing anthesis stage under prfrh was prolonged by 3 4 days compared with that under ck however jointing occurred 1 2 days earlier and anthesis and maturity stages were reached 1 2 and 3 4 days later under the 75 mm irrigation regime compared with those under non irrigation conditions and under the 150 mm irrigation regime compared with those under 75 mm irrigation thus compared to those with ck the durations of jointing anthesis and anthesis maturity were increased by 3 4 and 1 2 days under the 75 mm irrigation regime and by 5 6 and 2 3 days under 150 mm irrigation respectively 3 4 lai dry matter accumulation and grain filling characteristics the lai under prfrh was higher than that under ck similarly the lai under irrigation treatments was higher than that under non irrigation treatments while the lai under the 75 mm irrigation regime did not obviously differ from that under 150 mm irrigation fig s1 the dry matter accumulation rate under prfrh was greater than that under ck and increased with the irrigation volume the lai and amount of dry matter in the normal and wet years were greater than those in the dry year fig s2 the logistic regression model accurately captured the trends in the winter wheat grain filling process r2 0 99 the grain filling characteristics showed that prfrh had a higher grain filling rate than ck fig 6 the g max and g mean of prfrh increased by 4 3 and 5 0 compared with those of ck respectively however the effective grain filling duration under prfrh was shorter than that under ck with t 0 99 of 43 0 and 45 5 days under prfrh and ck respectively table s1 nevertheless the t 0 99 increased as the irrigation volume increased with t 0 99 of 40 8 44 5 and 47 5 days for the 0 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes respectively furthermore t 0 99 varied with precipitation year types in the dry year prfrh 45 3 days had a longer t 0 99 than ck 44 8 days conversely it had a shorter t 0 99 than ck in normal prfrh 46 9 days ck 52 7 days and wet prfrh 36 7 days ck 39 1 days years 3 5 grain yield and yield components planting practices and irrigation regimes significantly affected the yield p 0 05 table 2 the yield under prfrh was 13 7 lower than that under ck conversely the yield under the 75 mm irrigation regime was 11 0 higher than that under the non irrigation condition but no significant differences in yield were observed between 0 and 75 with 150 mm irrigation regimes p 0 05 fig 7 although the effect of precipitation year types on yield was not statistically significant p 0 05 the interaction between precipitation year types and planting practices significantly influenced the yield with a moderate effect value η2 0 331 table 2 the yield under prfrh was obviously higher than that under ck in the dry year while the yield under ck was higher than that under prfrh in the normal and wet years fig 7 planting practices significantly affected the spike number per unit area and kernel number per spike but did not significantly influence the kernel weight p 0 05 table 2 the spike number under prfrh was 12 1 lower while kernel number was 11 9 higher than those under ck fig 7 irrigation significantly increased the yield components p 0 05 table 2 however no significantly difference in spike number between the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes p 0 05 the spike number kernel number and kernel weight were 18 0 9 1 and 5 3 higher under 75 mm irrigation than those under ck and 10 3 15 2 and 7 5 higher under the 150 mm irrigation regime than those under ck respectively fig 7 the precipitation year types significantly affected the spike number and kernel number but did not significantly influence the kernel weight p 0 05 table 2 the spike number and kernel number were 34 9 and 30 8 higher in the normal year than in the dry year and 20 5 and 8 0 higher in the wet year than in the dry year respectively notably the interaction between precipitation year types and planting practices significantly influenced the kernel number p 0 01 table 2 the kernel number under prfrh in the dry year was higher than that under ck fig 7 3 6 water productivity and economic benefit planting practices significantly affected the wpc and planting practices and precipitation year types had a significant interaction effect on the wpc with a moderate effect value η2 0 376 p 0 05 table 2 however the precipitation year types and irrigation regimes did not significantly influence the wpc p 0 05 the wpc under prfrh was 14 0 higher than that under ck the wpc values under prfrh were 48 1 and 13 8 higher than those under ck in the dry and normal years respectively but were 12 1 lower than those under ck in the wet year fig 8 notably the wpi under the 75 mm irrigation regime was significantly higher than that under 150 mm irrigation regime p 0 05 table 2 prfrh increased plastic film labor and mechanical costs but reduced irrigation costs compared with those of ck in terms of net profit prfrh yielded 408 yuan ha 1 more than that of ck in the dry year whereas prfrh yielded 2058 and 7610 yuan ha 1 less than ck in the normal and rainy years respectively furthermore the net profit under the 75 mm irrigation regime was highest in the wet year while the net profit under the 150 mm irrigation regime was highest in the dry year table 3 overall prfrh was more economical than ck only in the dry year ck was more economical than prfrh in the normal and wet years and the 75 mm irrigation regime was relatively more economical than the 150 mm irrigation regime 4 discussion ridge furrow mulching systems and irrigation can increase the soil moisture of 0 80 cm soil depth liu et al 2020b mueller et al 2012 similarly in this study prfrh and irrigation mainly affected the sws at 0 80 cm soil depth however prfrh significantly increased the pre jointing sws by 8 which may be related to the high evaporation rate in the study area annual mean pan evaporation of 993 2 mm liu et al 2020c mulching reduces soil evaporation therefore prfrh can increase the soil water content gan et al 2013 before the jointing stage wheat plants are small have a small surface coverage and have a low transpiration rate liu et al 2002 showed that soil evaporation accounts for 68 9 of the total evapotranspiration before jointing stage but after the jointing stage the aboveground biomass of wheat increases the coverage is high and water consumption is dominated by transpiration which accounts for more than 70 of the total water consumption in addition precipitation is low during the wheat growth season consequently prfrh likely favored the significant increase in pre jointing sws moreover evapotranspiration for summer maize is 237 324 mm zheng et al 2021 while the precipitation values are 299 9 286 3 and 503 8 mm in the three summer maize seasons respectively these findings indicated that precipitation in maize season was more than the evapotranspiration therefore storing excess rainwater from the maize season for use in the wheat season could alleviate water scarcity in wheat to some extent this observation was also supported by our findings that the wheat season precipitation was lower in 2017 18 183 8 mm while the maize season precipitation was 503 8 mm fig 3 resulting in an obviously higher sws in 2017 18 than in 2015 16 and 2016 17 fig 4 these results further confirmed that 2017 18 could be reasonably classified as a wet year this study also showed that irrigation increased the post anthesis sws in northern china the main function of irrigation in the wintering stage is to maintain soil temperature this maybe led to the insignificant effect of irrigation on pre anthesis sws however irrigation at the jointing stage can improve sws mitigate wheat senescence and increase wheat yield liu et al 2021 these results are consistent with our findings i e irrigation significantly increased post anthesis sws however the results showed no obvious differences in the sws between the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes under low irrigation conditions irrigation water accumulates mainly within the shallow soil layer mueller et al 2012 an increase in the sws in the shallow soil layer promotes soil evaporation liu et al 2020c which unlikely caused any differences in the sws obtained with the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes furthermore wheat roots can exceed 2 m hoad et al 2001 in dry and normal years wheat absorbs deep soil moisture 80 200 cm after flowering resulting in a decrease in deep soil moisture however irrigation increase the soil moisture of 0 80 cm soil depth and optimize the root shoot ratio thereby reducing the consumption of deep soil moisture the warm and humid soil environment of prfrh stimulates seed germination and taproot and lateral root development thereby enhancing water and nutrient uptake by crops and accelerating crop growth bu et al 2013 gu et al 2019 soil warming advances phenology extending the tillering and spike differentiation durations which increase the ﬁnal spike number and grain number du et al 2022 in the present study prfrh was sufficient to increase the pre jointing soil moisture and thermal conditions consequently jointing occurred 3 4 days earlier and flowering occurred 1 2 days later thus the vegetative growth stage emergence to anthesis was prolonged resulting in a longer spike differentiation process this extended duration of spike differentiation causes an increase in the kernel number of wheat ji et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 therefore the kernel number under prfrh was significantly higher than that under ck in this study additionally a longer vegetative growth increases the lai and dry matter accumulation which enhance light interception by wheat garcía et al 2015 the longer spike differentiation period increases sink strength which in turn increases the grain filling photosynthetic rate fischer 2008 similarly our findings showed that prfrh increased the grain filling rate however wu et al 2022 performed soil warming experiments and found that soil warming promotes pre anthesis wheat growth but reduces the post anthesis duration photosynthetic capacities root growth indices and root to shoot ratio ultimately it inhibits the post anthesis dry matter accumulation and grain filling of wheat in this study the average surface soil temperature under prfrh was higher by 1 c than that under ck during the whole wheat growth period therefore the increase in soil temperature caused by prfrh accelerated wheat plant senescence and shortened the effective grain filling duration filling processes differ based on precipitation year types the grain filling rate and effective grain filling duration under prfrh were higher than those under ck and these variables increased with the irrigation volume compared with those under ck in the dry year however prfrh shortened the effective grain filling duration in the normal and wet years and the grain filling rate decreased with an increase in irrigation in the wet year in the dry year soil water content was the primary factor limiting crop growth and the improvement in soil moisture by prfrh promoted wheat growth however excessive soil moisture could inhibit wheat root respiration which can reduce the grain filling rate and effective grain filling duration in wheat araki et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 therefore prfrh may not be beneficial to grain filling in wet years in dryland agriculture the prfrh system can mitigate the impact of drought stress on crop production by utilizing low intensity precipitation daryanto et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 in the present study although precipitation year types did not affect the yield the interaction between precipitation year types and planting practice did wheat yield under prfrh significantly increased compared with that under ck in the dry year while wheat yield under prfrh was lower than that under ck in the normal and wet years this difference could be attributed to the ability of prfrh to favor the increase in wheat yield by increasing the kernel number in dry years while reducing the spike number because of the plastic mulched ridge in normal and wet years in normal and wet years the increased yield under prfrh via the increased kernel number cannot compensate for the yield loss caused by the reduced planted area this aspect may have contributed to the lower wheat yield under prfrh in the normal and wet years than that under ck sun et al 2020 also showed that prfrh can increase yield and profit in regions with an annual precipitation of 400 mm and a thermal time that ranges from 3000 cd to 4000 cd however li et al 2016 and liu et al 2020c showed that prfrh is an effective water saving technology that can improve wheat yield in dry semi humid areas which is inconsistent with our results this inconsistency might have occurred mainly because in the two year long experiment performed by li et al 2016 the annual precipitation were dry years 402 450 and 539 mm with a low growth periods of winter wheat 182 9 and 221 7 mm thus the wheat yield under prfrh was higher than that under ck in the two year long experiment of liu et al 2020c the precipitation values in the winter wheat season were 123 9 and 130 7 mm respectively but the annual precipitation was not considered therefore prfrh only improved wheat yield in dry years with less precipitation in dry semi humid areas moreover 75 mm irrigation regime improved the post anthesis soil moisture environment and mitigated wheat plant senescence consequently it effectively increased the kernel weight and grain yield of wheat under prfrh however excessive irrigation reduces the wp through an increase in soil evaporation and even reduces yield liu et al 2013 olesen et al 2000 accordingly wheat yield differences between the 75 mm and 150 mm irrigation regimes were not significant with limited water resources obtaining high yields and efficiency remains a key issue liu et al 2010 showed that prfrh can increase the wp our study revealed that wpc under prfrh was significantly higher than that under ck in the dry and normal years but the wpc under ck was higher than that under prfrh in the wet year moreover the wpc and wpi were much greater at the 75 mm irrigation regime than those at the 150 mm irrigation regime because excessive irrigation merely increases the evaporation caused by non physiological activities on the soil surface when the soil water content is above a specific threshold excessive irrigation reduces not only the yield but also the wpc and wpi liu et al 2010 qiu et al 2008 furthermore the net profit under prfrh was higher only in the dry year but the net profit under ck was higher in both normal and wet years in addition the net profit under the 75 mm irrigation regime was higher than that under the 0 and 150 mm irrigation regimes in the context of global climate change aridification prfrh combined with 75 mm irrigation volume may be a feasible option for ensuring food security and improving wp in dry semi humid areas in the future although prfrh is considered practical only in the dry year 5 conclusion prfrh significantly improved soil hydrothermal conditions and prolonged the duration of wheat spike differentiation thereby increasing the kernel number irrigation improved wheat post anthesis soil water scarcity mitigated wheat plant senescence and increased grain yield however the difference in yields obtained using the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes was not significant in general prfrh combined with 75 mm irrigation volume favored the high yield wp and net profit in the dry year therefore although prfrh cannot replace conventional flat planting in normal and wet years it can be used as an adaptive agronomic strategy to replace conventional cultivation practices in dry semi humid areas during dry years declaration

9351,the plastic mulched ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting prfrh planting practice is widely used in rain fed arid and semi arid areas however it remains unknown whether prfrh can replace or reduce irrigation to achieve a high and stable wheat yield in dry semi humid areas in this study two cultivation practices prfrh and conventional flat planting ck were used in combination with three irrigation regimes 0 75 and 150 mm to evaluate the efficacy of prfrh in different precipitation year types dry normal and wet years results showed that prfrh increased soil temperature and pre jointing soil water storage at 0 80 cm depth whereas irrigation increased post anthesis soil water storage at 0 80 cm depth furthermore prfrh prolonged the duration of the jointing anthesis stages and thereby increasing the kernel number both prfrh and irrigation increased dry matter accumulation and the leaf area index prfrh accelerated the grain filling rate but shortened the effective grain filling duration while irrigation extended the effective grain filling duration prfrh did not significantly influence kernel weight whereas irrigation increased kernel weight overall prfrh reduced the effective wheat planted area and thereby reducing spike number although it increased the kernel number resulting in yields that were 13 7 lower than those under ck the yield under prfrh was significantly higher than that under ck only in the dry year but lower in the normal and wet years irrigation increased the yield however the yield did not significantly differ between the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes the water productivity and net profit under 75 mm irrigation were relatively high in conclusion in dry semi humid areas prfrh combined with a 75 mm irrigation volume could mitigate drought stress to improve yield water productivity and net profit in dry years only keywords dry semi humid areas winter wheat plastic mulched ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting planting

approximately 1 35 billion km3 of water only 3 of freshwater resources can be used for drinking and agricultural irrigation ungureanu et al 2020 winpenny et al 2010 currently the global agricultural water consumption exceeds 2700 km3 accounting for approximately 70 of global freshwater with the increasing world population the demand for food has soared which in turn has led to an increase in the demand for agricultural water resources he et al 2021 by 2050 more than two thirds of the global population will have faced a water crisis because of excessive water consumption through agricultural production une 2015 moreover because of climate change extreme weather can have a substantial negative impact on the quality and availability of water resources which may further exacerbate global water scarcity by 20 fao 2016 with population growth and water shortage the primary problem that must be addressed to feed the increasing population is the development of methods for increasing food production based on existing water resources dry semi humid areas in north china cover more than 15 3 million hm2 and account for approximately 14 1 of china s grain yield and these areas are defined as zones with an annual precipitation of 500 600 mm and a dryness ratio of 1 3 1 6 annual evaporation vs annual precipitation li et al 2017 dry semi humid areas frequently experience drought stresses during crop growing seasons which tend to lower the crop yield and productivity the main cropping system currently used in these areas is winter wheat summer maize double cropping most precipitation occurs as rain during the summer maize growing period rainy season in july september because of the influence of the asian summer monsoon precipitation during the growing period of winter wheat is only about 100 200 mm while the water requirement of winter wheat is approximately 450 mm liu et al 2002 local farmers irrigate their winter wheat fields two to four times during the wheat growth period to increase yield with the total irrigation ranging from 165 to 440 mm li et al 2016 2019 however the irrigation water utilization rate and crop water production efficiency of conventional irrigation flood irrigation are 45 and 0 8 kg m 3 respectively resulting in a significant wastage of limited water resources xu et al 2003 in addition extensive irrigation of wheat has also caused a pronounced decline in groundwater levels resulting in a groundwater funnel situation feng et al 2013 therefore new ways must be established to improve water productivity and conserve water for efficient agriculture and long term agricultural development in dry semi arid areas with limited water resources various agronomic techniques have been utilized to improve dryland crop production in arid and semi arid areas ferrand and cecunjanin 2014 zhang et al 2018 for example the plastic mulched ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting prfrh planting practice is widely used worldwide gan et al 2013 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 mo et al 2017 it is considered a simple cost effective and innovative solution that can be used to increase food production in china it has improved crop yields and water use efficiency by 45 5 and 58 0 respectively and has contributed 3 0 107 metric tons of crop production sun et al 2020 this technique involves alternating ridges and furrows wherein plastic mulched ridges collect the runoff generated by precipitation and transfer it to un mulched planting furrows thus light precipitation exhibits a superposition effect consequently promoting precipitation infiltration and improving water use efficiency li et al 2017 prfrh ensures precipitation retention in soil reduces wasteful evaporation improves soil hydrothermal conditions and increases crop water use and yield which is one of the main strategies for saving water in arid and semi arid dryland areas gan et al 2013 crop yield depends on the synchronization of crop growth and precipitation mo et al 2017 ren et al 2009 droughts in spring and summer caused by the monsoon climate and the intensification of conflicts in water use have seriously decreased the yield of winter wheat in dry semi humid areas zhao et al 2020 hence irrigation is necessary to ensure sufficient wheat production however considering the effectiveness of prfrh in dryland agriculture studies have yet to clarify whether it can be applied to irrigated farmland systems to improve the water use efficiency of crops and thus reduce the amount of irrigation water used for crop production based on field experiments under varying annual precipitation i e dry normal and wet years this study investigated the effects of prfrh combined with irrigation on the growth of winter wheat and its effectiveness in minimizing water usage in dry and semi humid areas in china furthermore we sought to determine the potential role of prfrh in soil hydrothermal properties winter wheat growth and development grain yield and water resource use efficiency under irrigation conditions in dry semi humid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted during three wheat growing seasons 2015 2018 at the experimental station of northwest a f university 34 20 n 108 04 e in guanzhong plain in china fig 1 the guanzhong plain a typical dry semi humid region has relatively flat terrains and flourishing agriculture geng et al 2013 there are significant concerns about water resources in the guanzhong plain where more than 60 of total annual water resources are used for irrigation tang et al 2015 the intensive winter wheat summer maize double cropping system dominates agricultural production the soil is a eum orthic anthrosol chinses soil taxonomy the organic matter

conventional flat planting ck fig 1 for each practice three irrigation regimes i e 0 75 and 150 mm were used the experiment was laid out in a split plot design with planting practices in the main plot and irrigation regimes in the subplot each treatment was replicated thrice in plots that were 5 m long and 4 4 m wide fig 1 in this study the winter wheat summer maize cropping system was adopted during the summer maize growth season drought has less effect on maize therefore irrigation was not applied from this the study focused only on variables related to the winter wheat season 2 3 field management rotary tillage was applied before wheat sowing and 225 kg n ha 1 75 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 150 kg k2o ha 1 were applied as basal fertilizers for all treatments then the prfrh system was established fig 1 which consisted of alternating ridges 40 cm wide and 15 cm high and furrows 60 cm wide with a plastic film 0 008 mm thick mulched on the ridge wheat was planted in the furrows with a row spacing of 20 cm and a sowing rate of 225 kg ha 1 wheat seeds were sown on october 12 2015 october 4 2016 and october 18 2017 and the crops were harvested on june 5 2016 june 1 2017 and june 7 2018 according to the local irrigation system winter wheat was irrigated at the wintering average daily temperature below 3 4 c continuously and jointing first node of the stem visible at the base of the shoot stages the irrigation volume was split and applied equally during the two stages the edge of each plot was lined with a 2 m wide isolation belt to prevent water infiltration weeding and pest control were performed regularly during the growth period 2 4 sampling and laboratory analysis 2 4 1 wheat phenology phenological stages were recorded regularly using the zadoks phenological scale zadoks et al 1974 2 4 2 soil temperature and moisture automatic temperature probes were used to record the soil temperature daily at 5 cm soil depth soil moisture was measured using the oven drying method at different growth stages of winter wheat i e emergence z10 regreening z30 jointing z31 anthesis z60 milky ripe z75 and maturity z92 soil samples were obtained at 10 and 20 cm of 0 10 and 10 200 cm layers respectively soil water storage sws mm was calculated as follows 1 sws i n h i ρ i b i 10 ρ w where h cm is the soil layer depth ρ g cm 3 is the soil bulk density b is the soil water

projected area m2 of the plant canopy for calculating dry matter accumulation the aboveground total biomass of two rows was oven dried at 105 c for 30 min and later at 75 c until the weights became constant at the anthesis stage 150 spikes with the same growing trend were selected and labeled in each plot ten labeled spikes were selected from each plot with a 3 day interval between anthesis and maturity a logistic growth curve was fitted to the grain dry weight data fig 2 liu et al 2020b as follows 2 w a 1 b e kt where w mg is the grain weight a mg is the final grain weight t days is the

precipitation m is the average annual precipitation and σ is the standard error for precipitation di is used to distinguish among the wet di 0 35 normal 0 35 di 0 35 and dry di 0 35 years the annual precipitation in 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 were 503 3 574 4 and 687 6 mm respectively fig 3 the average annual precipitation was 592 3 mm over a 40 year period provided by the climate data center of the china meteorological administration based on the di 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 were considered dry di 0 59 0 35 normal di 0 12 0 35 di 0 35 and wet di 0 64 0 35 years respectively 2 6 statistical analysis mixed effect models in r package lme4 bates et al 2015 were used to analyze how planting practices and irrigation regimes influenced sws and how precipitation year types planting practices and irrigation regimes influenced yield components grain yield and wp this experiment was conducted with a blocked split plot design and 1 block planting and 1 block year planting were chosen as random effects a pairwise tukey comparison was performed using the r software packages multcomp hothorn et al 2008 and emmeans lenth 2021 statistical significance was evaluated at p 0 05 and p 0 01 since anova can compare statistically significant differences between treatments but cannot assess effect size η2 recommended by bakeman 2005 was used as the calculated effect value to examine the effect sizes of treatments the effect values η2 of 0 3 0 3 0 5 and 0 5 were described as small medium and large respectively all statistical analyses were performed with r 4 1 0 using rstudio 2022 02 1 461 figures were generated using ggplot2 and originpro 2016 3 results 3 1 soil water storage the sws at the soil depth range of 0 200 cm in different treatments is shown in fig 4 both planting practices and irrigation regimes significantly affected sws at a soil depth of 0 80 cm p 0 05 at the soil depth of 0 40 cm the sws under prfrh was significantly higher than that under ck before the jointing stage p 0 05 the average sws under prfrh was 8 3 higher than that under ck during the emergence jointing stage additionally at the soil depth of 0 40 cm after the anthesis stage the sws under irrigation conditions was significantly higher than that under non irrigation conditions p 0 05 the average sws under the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regmimes were 10 5 and 15 7 higher than those under non irrigation conditions during the anthesis maturating stage respectively conversely no obvious differences were observed between the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes at the soil depth of 40 80 cm prfrh and irrigation also increased the pre jointing and post anthesis sws respectively prfrh had 8 7 higher pre jointing sws than ck the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes increased the post anthesis sws by 11 3 and 8 3 respectively compared with those under non irrigation conditions thus prfrh increased pre jointing sws but irrigation increased post anthesis sws the interannual variation in sws was large and the sws in the wet year was obviously higher than that in the normal and dry years especially at 80 200 cm soil depth the sws values in the normal and dry years were 21 4 and 26 9 lower than those in the wet year respectively at the emergence stage at a soil depth of 80 200 cm with increasing wheat growth the soil water consumption of deep soil increased especially in the dry and normal years furthermore irrigation reduced the deep soil water consumption of wheat and occurred later in the wheat growth period the average sws values at 80 200 cm soil depth under the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes were 5 2 and 9 0 higher than those under non irrigation conditions respectively while no obvious differences were observed between the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes however the effect of planting practices on deep soil sws was not significant p 0 05 3 2 soil temperature surface soil temperature analyses revealed that prfrh increased soil temperature fig 5 the soil temperature under prfrh was obviously higher than that under ck the average surface soil temperature under prfrh was 1 c higher than that under ck during the wheat growth period however the effect of irrigation regimes on soil temperature was not obvious 3 3 phenological stages planting practices and irrigation regimes altered the phenological stages of winter wheat table 1 the emergence and jointing stages under prfrh occurred 3 4 and 2 3 days earlier than those under ck respectively however the anthesis and maturity stages under prfrh occurred 1 2 days later than that under ck respectively therefore the duration of the jointing anthesis stage under prfrh was prolonged by 3 4 days compared with that under ck however jointing occurred 1 2 days earlier and anthesis and maturity stages were reached 1 2 and 3 4 days later under the 75 mm irrigation regime compared with those under non irrigation conditions and under the 150 mm irrigation regime compared with those under 75 mm irrigation thus compared to those with ck the durations of jointing anthesis and anthesis maturity were increased by 3 4 and 1 2 days under the 75 mm irrigation regime and by 5 6 and 2 3 days under 150 mm irrigation respectively 3 4 lai dry matter accumulation and grain filling characteristics the lai under prfrh was higher than that under ck similarly the lai under irrigation treatments was higher than that under non irrigation treatments while the lai under the 75 mm irrigation regime did not obviously differ from that under 150 mm irrigation fig s1 the dry matter accumulation rate under prfrh was greater than that under ck and increased with the irrigation volume the lai and amount of dry matter in the normal and wet years were greater than those in the dry year fig s2 the logistic regression model accurately captured the trends in the winter wheat grain filling process r2 0 99 the grain filling characteristics showed that prfrh had a higher grain filling rate than ck fig 6 the g max and g mean of prfrh increased by 4 3 and 5 0 compared with those of ck respectively however the effective grain filling duration under prfrh was shorter than that under ck with t 0 99 of 43 0 and 45 5 days under prfrh and ck respectively table s1 nevertheless the t 0 99 increased as the irrigation volume increased with t 0 99 of 40 8 44 5 and 47 5 days for the 0 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes respectively furthermore t 0 99 varied with precipitation year types in the dry year prfrh 45 3 days had a longer t 0 99 than ck 44 8 days conversely it had a shorter t 0 99 than ck in normal prfrh 46 9 days ck 52 7 days and wet prfrh 36 7 days ck 39 1 days years 3 5 grain yield and yield components planting practices and irrigation regimes significantly affected the yield p 0 05 table 2 the yield under prfrh was 13 7 lower than that under ck conversely the yield under the 75 mm irrigation regime was 11 0 higher than that under the non irrigation condition but no significant differences in yield were observed between 0 and 75 with 150 mm irrigation regimes p 0 05 fig 7 although the effect of precipitation year types on yield was not statistically significant p 0 05 the interaction between precipitation year types and planting practices significantly influenced the yield with a moderate effect value η2 0 331 table 2 the yield under prfrh was obviously higher than that under ck in the dry year while the yield under ck was higher than that under prfrh in the normal and wet years fig 7 planting practices significantly affected the spike number per unit area and kernel number per spike but did not significantly influence the kernel weight p 0 05 table 2 the spike number under prfrh was 12 1 lower while kernel number was 11 9 higher than those under ck fig 7 irrigation significantly increased the yield components p 0 05 table 2 however no significantly difference in spike number between the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes p 0 05 the spike number kernel number and kernel weight were 18 0 9 1 and 5 3 higher under 75 mm irrigation than those under ck and 10 3 15 2 and 7 5 higher under the 150 mm irrigation regime than those under ck respectively fig 7 the precipitation year types significantly affected the spike number and kernel number but did not significantly influence the kernel weight p 0 05 table 2 the spike number and kernel number were 34 9 and 30 8 higher in the normal year than in the dry year and 20 5 and 8 0 higher in the wet year than in the dry year respectively notably the interaction between precipitation year types and planting practices significantly influenced the kernel number p 0 01 table 2 the kernel number under prfrh in the dry year was higher than that under ck fig 7 3 6 water productivity and economic benefit planting practices significantly affected the wpc and planting practices and precipitation year types had a significant interaction effect on the wpc with a moderate effect value η2 0 376 p 0 05 table 2 however the precipitation year types and irrigation regimes did not significantly influence the wpc p 0 05 the wpc under prfrh was 14 0 higher than that under ck the wpc values under prfrh were 48 1 and 13 8 higher than those under ck in the dry and normal years respectively but were 12 1 lower than those under ck in the wet year fig 8 notably the wpi under the 75 mm irrigation regime was significantly higher than that under 150 mm irrigation regime p 0 05 table 2 prfrh increased plastic film labor and mechanical costs but reduced irrigation costs compared with those of ck in terms of net profit prfrh yielded 408 yuan ha 1 more than that of ck in the dry year whereas prfrh yielded 2058 and 7610 yuan ha 1 less than ck in the normal and rainy years respectively furthermore the net profit under the 75 mm irrigation regime was highest in the wet year while the net profit under the 150 mm irrigation regime was highest in the dry year table 3 overall prfrh was more economical than ck only in the dry year ck was more economical than prfrh in the normal and wet years and the 75 mm irrigation regime was relatively more economical than the 150 mm irrigation regime 4 discussion ridge furrow mulching systems and irrigation can increase the soil moisture of 0 80 cm soil depth liu et al 2020b mueller et al 2012 similarly in this study prfrh and irrigation mainly affected the sws at 0 80 cm soil depth however prfrh significantly increased the pre jointing sws by 8 which may be related to the high evaporation rate in the study area annual mean pan evaporation of 993 2 mm liu et al 2020c mulching reduces soil evaporation therefore prfrh can increase the soil water content gan et al 2013 before the jointing stage wheat plants are small have a small surface coverage and have a low transpiration rate liu et al 2002 showed that soil evaporation accounts for 68 9 of the total evapotranspiration before jointing stage but after the jointing stage the aboveground biomass of wheat increases the coverage is high and water consumption is dominated by transpiration which accounts for more than 70 of the total water consumption in addition precipitation is low during the wheat growth season consequently prfrh likely favored the significant increase in pre jointing sws moreover evapotranspiration for summer maize is 237 324 mm zheng et al 2021 while the precipitation values are 299 9 286 3 and 503 8 mm in the three summer maize seasons respectively these findings indicated that precipitation in maize season was more than the evapotranspiration therefore storing excess rainwater from the maize season for use in the wheat season could alleviate water scarcity in wheat to some extent this observation was also supported by our findings that the wheat season precipitation was lower in 2017 18 183 8 mm while the maize season precipitation was 503 8 mm fig 3 resulting in an obviously higher sws in 2017 18 than in 2015 16 and 2016 17 fig 4 these results further confirmed that 2017 18 could be reasonably classified as a wet year this study also showed that irrigation increased the post anthesis sws in northern china the main function of irrigation in the wintering stage is to maintain soil temperature this maybe led to the insignificant effect of irrigation on pre anthesis sws however irrigation at the jointing stage can improve sws mitigate wheat senescence and increase wheat yield liu et al 2021 these results are consistent with our findings i e irrigation significantly increased post anthesis sws however the results showed no obvious differences in the sws between the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes under low irrigation conditions irrigation water accumulates mainly within the shallow soil layer mueller et al 2012 an increase in the sws in the shallow soil layer promotes soil evaporation liu et al 2020c which unlikely caused any differences in the sws obtained with the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes furthermore wheat roots can exceed 2 m hoad et al 2001 in dry and normal years wheat absorbs deep soil moisture 80 200 cm after flowering resulting in a decrease in deep soil moisture however irrigation increase the soil moisture of 0 80 cm soil depth and optimize the root shoot ratio thereby reducing the consumption of deep soil moisture the warm and humid soil environment of prfrh stimulates seed germination and taproot and lateral root development thereby enhancing water and nutrient uptake by crops and accelerating crop growth bu et al 2013 gu et al 2019 soil warming advances phenology extending the tillering and spike differentiation durations which increase the ﬁnal spike number and grain number du et al 2022 in the present study prfrh was sufficient to increase the pre jointing soil moisture and thermal conditions consequently jointing occurred 3 4 days earlier and flowering occurred 1 2 days later thus the vegetative growth stage emergence to anthesis was prolonged resulting in a longer spike differentiation process this extended duration of spike differentiation causes an increase in the kernel number of wheat ji et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 therefore the kernel number under prfrh was significantly higher than that under ck in this study additionally a longer vegetative growth increases the lai and dry matter accumulation which enhance light interception by wheat garcía et al 2015 the longer spike differentiation period increases sink strength which in turn increases the grain filling photosynthetic rate fischer 2008 similarly our findings showed that prfrh increased the grain filling rate however wu et al 2022 performed soil warming experiments and found that soil warming promotes pre anthesis wheat growth but reduces the post anthesis duration photosynthetic capacities root growth indices and root to shoot ratio ultimately it inhibits the post anthesis dry matter accumulation and grain filling of wheat in this study the average surface soil temperature under prfrh was higher by 1 c than that under ck during the whole wheat growth period therefore the increase in soil temperature caused by prfrh accelerated wheat plant senescence and shortened the effective grain filling duration filling processes differ based on precipitation year types the grain filling rate and effective grain filling duration under prfrh were higher than those under ck and these variables increased with the irrigation volume compared with those under ck in the dry year however prfrh shortened the effective grain filling duration in the normal and wet years and the grain filling rate decreased with an increase in irrigation in the wet year in the dry year soil water content was the primary factor limiting crop growth and the improvement in soil moisture by prfrh promoted wheat growth however excessive soil moisture could inhibit wheat root respiration which can reduce the grain filling rate and effective grain filling duration in wheat araki et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 therefore prfrh may not be beneficial to grain filling in wet years in dryland agriculture the prfrh system can mitigate the impact of drought stress on crop production by utilizing low intensity precipitation daryanto et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 in the present study although precipitation year types did not affect the yield the interaction between precipitation year types and planting practice did wheat yield under prfrh significantly increased compared with that under ck in the dry year while wheat yield under prfrh was lower than that under ck in the normal and wet years this difference could be attributed to the ability of prfrh to favor the increase in wheat yield by increasing the kernel number in dry years while reducing the spike number because of the plastic mulched ridge in normal and wet years in normal and wet years the increased yield under prfrh via the increased kernel number cannot compensate for the yield loss caused by the reduced planted area this aspect may have contributed to the lower wheat yield under prfrh in the normal and wet years than that under ck sun et al 2020 also showed that prfrh can increase yield and profit in regions with an annual precipitation of 400 mm and a thermal time that ranges from 3000 cd to 4000 cd however li et al 2016 and liu et al 2020c showed that prfrh is an effective water saving technology that can improve wheat yield in dry semi humid areas which is inconsistent with our results this inconsistency might have occurred mainly because in the two year long experiment performed by li et al 2016 the annual precipitation were dry years 402 450 and 539 mm with a low growth periods of winter wheat 182 9 and 221 7 mm thus the wheat yield under prfrh was higher than that under ck in the two year long experiment of liu et al 2020c the precipitation values in the winter wheat season were 123 9 and 130 7 mm respectively but the annual precipitation was not considered therefore prfrh only improved wheat yield in dry years with less precipitation in dry semi humid areas moreover 75 mm irrigation regime improved the post anthesis soil moisture environment and mitigated wheat plant senescence consequently it effectively increased the kernel weight and grain yield of wheat under prfrh however excessive irrigation reduces the wp through an increase in soil evaporation and even reduces yield liu et al 2013 olesen et al 2000 accordingly wheat yield differences between the 75 mm and 150 mm irrigation regimes were not significant with limited water resources obtaining high yields and efficiency remains a key issue liu et al 2010 showed that prfrh can increase the wp our study revealed that wpc under prfrh was significantly higher than that under ck in the dry and normal years but the wpc under ck was higher than that under prfrh in the wet year moreover the wpc and wpi were much greater at the 75 mm irrigation regime than those at the 150 mm irrigation regime because excessive irrigation merely increases the evaporation caused by non physiological activities on the soil surface when the soil water content is above a specific threshold excessive irrigation reduces not only the yield but also the wpc and wpi liu et al 2010 qiu et al 2008 furthermore the net profit under prfrh was higher only in the dry year but the net profit under ck was higher in both normal and wet years in addition the net profit under the 75 mm irrigation regime was higher than that under the 0 and 150 mm irrigation regimes in the context of global climate change aridification prfrh combined with 75 mm irrigation volume may be a feasible option for ensuring food security and improving wp in dry semi humid areas in the future although prfrh is considered practical only in the dry year 5 conclusion prfrh significantly improved soil hydrothermal conditions and prolonged the duration of wheat spike differentiation thereby increasing the kernel number irrigation improved wheat post anthesis soil water scarcity mitigated wheat plant senescence and increased grain yield however the difference in yields obtained using the 75 and 150 mm irrigation regimes was not significant in general prfrh combined with 75 mm irrigation volume favored the high yield wp and net profit in the dry year therefore although prfrh cannot replace conventional flat planting in normal and wet years it can be used as an adaptive agronomic strategy to replace conventional cultivation practices in dry semi humid areas during dry years declaration

9352,increasing demand for food has amplified the use of fertilizer intensive agriculture practices in the upper mississippi basin have been linked to the formation of a hypoxic zone in the gulf of mexico previous studies have recommended the use of winter cover crop in the maize soybean rotation as an eco efficient solution in reducing the nitrate nitrogen no3 n loss via a sub surface drainage system therefore the objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of cereal rye as a winter cover crop in the maize soybean system on reducing nutrient loss via tile drainage using the dssat model the experiments include four treatments with a combination of two different nitrogen n application timing with cover crop cc and without cover crop ncc fall applied n without cover crop fn spring applied n without cover crop sn fall applied n with cover crop fcc and spring applied n with cover crop scc the calibrated dssat model was utilized to assess the impact of the cover crop by comparing no3 n losses and cash crop yields between cc and ncc treatments for different n fertilization timings the model calibrated for cereal rye biomass in the fcc treatment estimated the observed cereal rye growth for scc treatment considerably well r2 0 91 the model successfully predicted the impact of cereal rye on nitrate loss and tile drainage with 43 6 and 45 4 48 6 and 47 8 observed nitrate loss reduction and 21 3 and 21 0 30 2 and 19 4 observed tile drainage volume reduction in fall and spring n application treatments respectively the results from this research suggest that dssat can predict the cereal rye growth and assess the soil water nutrient dynamics in both cc and ncc systems however the model was not able to replicate the impact of cereal rye on the cash crop yields due to the higher n mineralization simulated in the cc compared to the ncc treatments this could be due to the use of glyphosate to terminate the cereal rye and the presence of tillage radish along with the cereal rye the glyphosate application hastens the decomposition process however it also reduces the overall residue the chemical termination and intercropping feature are not available in the dssat model currently the cereal rye hosted pathogens and pests might also be responsible for lowering maize yield in the observations graphical abstract ga1 keywords cereal rye maize soybean

agricultural land to achieve high crop yields in the region cao et al 2018 intensive farming practices in the mississippi river basin mrb have been attributed to environmental issues like hypoxia formation biodiversity degradation and habitat loss at the gulf of mexico rabalais et al 2001 rabalais and turner 2019 the nitrate leaching from agricultural lands in the midwest regions is not only responsible for creating the hypoxia zone of the gulf of mexico but also degrading the water quality within the region excessive nitrate a byproduct of n fertilizer leaches below the vadose zone and is carried away through the artificial natural surface subsurface flow to creeks and streams to the mississippi river turner et al 2006 alexander et al 2008 found that more than half of the nitrate load in mrb is generated by the corn belt region alone due to shallow water table depth and poorly drained soil a subsurface tile drainage system is popular in the upper mrb region to sustain agricultural productivity according to the 2017 census of agriculture from the united states department of agriculture usda 39 5 of the total cropland 97 137 km2 in the state of illinois is tile drained usda 2019 the tile drained farmlands in illinois are the state s largest contributor of nitrate load to the mrb david et al 2010 several studies have identified various solutions like altering n application timing winter cover crop crop rotation conservation tillage etc to reduce nitrate loss through the subsurface drainage in the mrb region dinnes et al 2002 jeong and bhattarai 2018 luo et al 2010 singh et al 2020 strock et al 2004 growing winter cover crops in the maize soybean rotation were found to be one of the economically viable methods in reducing nitrate loss to drainage channels dabney et al 2010 dinnes et al 2002 strock et al 2004 several previous studies have repoted that the use of cereal rye as a winter cover crop not only reduces the overall drainage volume but also helps in reducing nitrate loss through tile drainage system baker and griffis 2009 feyereisen et al 2006 lacey and armstrong 2015 malone et al 2014 ruffatti et al 2019 feyereisen et al 2006 concluded that the cereal rye used as a winter cover crop was able to reduce nitrate loss by more than 11 in southwestern minnesota they also estimated the potential of more than a 30 reduction of nitrate loss by increasing the span of cereal rye growth by a month a long term impact of cereal rye on soil n budget by qi et al 2011 reported the reduction of annual tile drainage by 11 and nitrate loss by 22 in iowa computer simulation models are helpful in investigating the impact of several alternate management practices in the short term or the impact of agricultural management practices in the long term due to the budgetary and human capital limitations the advancement of the process based crop simulation model has also helped researchers and scientists to interpret the nexus of climate variables crop management and soil n water dynamics the persistent improvements in the crop modeling field have contributed to developing several adaptation mitigation strategies and economic policies in the agriculture domain maiorano et al 2017 several crop models have been used to understand the phenology of cereal rye as a winter cover crop and foresee its impact on the maize soybean system and soil water nitrogen dynamics to reduce nitrate loss via subsurface drainage channels basche et al 2016a feyereisen et al 2006 malone et al 2017 2014 yeo et al 2014 to our knowledge there are no studies that have used decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat jones et al 2003 without its integration with any other models to simulate cereal rye growth as a winter cover crop and analyze its impact on soil nitrogen water dynamics in the maize soybean rotation therefore the present study is focused on examining the impact of cereal rye as a winter cover crop on soil n water dynamics using dssat dssat is an interface that integrates results from different crop models with more than 42 crops allowing multi year sequential simulations however it does not have a separate model to simulate the growth of cereal rye similar characteristics of cereal rye and winter wheat led several researchers to utilize the ceres crop environment resource synthesis wheat model of dssat as a proxy model to simulate the cereal rye growth for example kladivko et al 2014 malone et al 2017 qi et al 2011 and singer et al 2011 used ceres wheat model as a crop component of root zone water quality model rzwqm apart from similarities cereal rye is more tolerant to the harsh winter temperature 25 to 35 c than winter wheat 0 10 c due to this the majority of the previous studies which used dssat with its integration with rzwqm altered the weather parameters especially minimum temperature to imitate the growth of cereal rye kladivko et al 2014 malone et al 2017 qi et al 2011 singer et al 2011 likewise leuthold et al 2021 also utilized the ceres wheat model of dssat to predict the cereal rye biomass in kentucky it should be noted that the winters are not severe enough to impact the cereal wheat growth in kentucky therefore adjusting a few genotype coefficients of the winter wheat cultivar of dssat worked well for leuthold et al 2021 to simulate cereal rye biomass however we modified a few ecotype and species type coefficients along with genotype coefficients of a winter wheat cultivar available in the ceres wheat model to replicate the cereal rye growth in this study dssat has been one of the most recognized models in rationally accessing the linkage of crop growth and development with environmental changes and management practices globally however several researchers have criticized its subsurface drainage and soil nitrogen modules for its weak performance boote and jones 2013 liu et al 2011b 2011a negm et al 2014 therefore in this research a bug in the source codes of the soil nitrogen module of dssat was identified and resolved to appropriately compute the nitrate nitrogen loss via tile drainage these modifications are incorporated in the latest version of dssat v4 7 5 please refer to section 2 2 for more details on the bug resolved therefore the capability of the dssat v4 7 5 to reproduce soil water nitrogen dynamics in a maize soybean rotation system with cereal rye as a winter cover crop was tested in this study based on these identified knowledge gaps the objectives of our research are i to calibrate and validate the dssat model for cereal rye biomass in the maize soybean rotation using its ceres wheat model ii to calibrate and validate the model for the tile drainage and nitrate loss via tile drains and iii to analyze the impact of cereal rye as a winter cover crop on soil water nitrogen budget and cash crop growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment detail the field experiments were conducted at illinois state university nitrogen management research field station lexington il usa 40 64 n 88 72 w ruffatti et al 2019 the research site is relatively flat 0 2 slopes and contains drummer and el paso silty clay loam soils the experimental site is equipped with a tile drainage system 13 7 m apart at 0 9 m depth due to the inadequate drainage capability of the soil for this research the maize soybean rotation was implemented for four years from sep 2014 to oct 2018 table 1 the seed mixture of cereal rye and tillage radish as the winter cover crops in the ratio of 92 8 by weight was surface broadcasted during the late fall season using a self propelled sprayer modified with an air seeding box hagie sts12 hagie manufacturing company clarion iowa us the cereal rye was chemically terminated using glyphosate herbicide at 2 34 liters ha termination dates are reported in table 1 maize and soybeans were planted using a john deere 1770 n t 24 row planter no till with a target seed rate of 8 65 seeds m2 8 35 plants m2 emerged and 44 5 seeds m2 34 8 plants m2 emerged respectively table s1 there were 12 experimental plots 0 65 ha each with three replications with four treatments two fertilizer application routines i e fall and spring split nitrogen n application and two winter cover crop scenarios i e cover crop cc and no cover crop ncc hence the treatments in this study include fcc fall split n application with cc fn fall split n application without cc scc spring split n application with cc sn spring split n application without cc table s1 please refer to ruffatti et al 2019 for more details 2 2 model description and inputs dssat is an interface that combines several cropping system models capable of understanding crop growth and development along with soil water nitrogen and carbon models to assess the soil water nitrogen dynamics hoogenboom et al 2010 jones et al 2003 dssat can integrate the simulation outcomes of a long sequence of crop rotations with a variety of crop land management decisions and environmental options as a function of the soil crop climate dynamics jones et al 2010 the present study uses dssat v4 7 5 which can simulate the growth yield and biomass of more than 42 crops however there is still no specific crop model for simulating cereal rye growth therefore the ceres wheat model of dssat was used as a proxy model for cereal rye growth simulation the ceres maize and cropgro soybean models of dssat were used to simulate the growth of cereal maize and soybean respectively in the present study soil hydrology and organic matter were computed using the ritchie water balance approach and century model respectively the infiltrated water which is the subtraction of runoff estimated by modified usda soil conservation service curve scs curve number method from precipitation was used to estimate the downward water flux the downward flux of water and the drainage coefficient along with soil lower limit wilting point drained upper limit field capacity of soil and saturated soil water content were utilized to determine the water drained from each soil layer to estimate the tile drainage the earlier version of dssat before v4 7 5 did not simulate the soil nitrogen balance properly it was missing the nitrate loss via tile drains nltd component from the soil n balance and dssat output therefore the bug was identified and fixed as a part of this study it was a minor issue in the dssat source codes the earlier version of the model calculated nltd for the soil layer with the tile drain however it did not subtract the nltd component from the n flux of that layer disrupting the soil n balance a simple equation to add the nltd component in soil n balance was introduced to fix the problem in n flux calculation resolving this issue did not require adding any new methodology to the source codes rather a small bug in the source code of dssat was fixed to produce the nltd component in the dssat outputs and accurately predict the soil n balance the changes were reported to the dssat development team who incorporated them in the next release the latest version of dssat v4 7 5 used in this study already incorporated these changes in the source codes daily precipitation solar radiation wind speed with minimum and maximum temperatures were recorded by a weather station available at the experimental site the layered soil information of bulk density lower upper drained limits saturated soil water content and soil organic carbon content was collected from the recent ssurgo soil survey geographic database for modeling purposes the experiment based crop management information for instance planting harvesting date plant density fertilizer application timing and rate and tillage were added into dssat table s1 the tile drainage was recorded using a data logger installed in the water level control structures while tile nitrate concentrations were measured in a laboratory the crop biomass was estimated at a laboratory while the crop yields were measured at the field 2 3 model calibration validation and evaluation the model was set up and ran for seven years 2012 18 the first two years 2012 14 were used as the warm up period to establish the initial soil conditions and the results from 2014 to 18 were utilized to calibrate and validate the model the process of calibrating dssat was segregated into several steps in the following order soil water nitrogen balance cereal rye growth and cash crop growth calibration for calibrating the soil water balance the daily observed tile drainage values were compared with the simulated tile drainage for the soil nitrogen balance daily observed nitrate loss through tile drainage was compared with simulated values the soil parameters field capacity wilting point saturated water content bulk density and organic carbon collected from ssurgo database were used to estimate the soil properties at the required soil horizon using linear interpolation later these soil properties were adjusted to calibrate the model for the soil water nitrogen dynamics soil root growth factor srgf was calculated as using an equation srgf exp 0 02 center of layers for center of layers 20 otherwise srgf 1 wilkens et al 2004 tables 2 and 3 soil water balance and partitioning of precipitation into the evapotranspiration tile drainage deep percolation runoff and soil water retained released were verified with other similar studies in illinois jeong et al 2019 singh et al 2020 the cover crop can alter the soil properties for example it can increase field capacity saturated soil water content organic carbon content and decrease bulk density basche and delonge 2017 rorick and kladivko 2017 therefore an approach to calibrate the treatment with the cover crop fcc and without cover crop fn individually was adapted to optimize the set of soil parameters for each treatment separately the soil bulk density organic carbon content field capacity and saturated water content were optimized primarily to calibrate fn treatment after calibrating fcc treatment another important soil parameter in dssat for controlling tile drainage was sldr related to per day drainage rate slrd for fcc and fn was calibrated to 0 04 and 0 01 respectively the soil properties calibrated for fcc and fn treatments were utilized to validate the model on scc and sn treatments respectively for soil water and nitrogen budget after the soil water nitrogen budget calibration the crop biomass and yield calibration were conducted to simulate the whole agroecological system the calibration process was initiated with the cereal rye biomass calibration followed by maize soybean biomass and yield calibration since the dssat does not provide a separate model to predict the cereal rye growth the ceres wheat model was used as a surrogate model due to the similarities in the phenological properties of winter wheat and cereal rye however these two crops have different tolerance capacities for low temperatures the high tolerance capacity of cereal rye for the midwest s harsh climate makes it a suitable winter cover crop in the region cereal rye can sustain in temperatures as low as 35 c whereas the lowest viable temperature for winter wheat is 10 c therefore the temperature related parameters in dssat were adjusted to prevent the cereal rye plant from hardening hence dropping the biomass suddenly due to lower temperatures in the winter table 4 a similar approach was used by basche et al 2016a to replicate the observed cereal rye biomass using the wheat module of the apsim model other parameters in the ecotype coefficient file were related to photosynthetically active radiation usage and leaf area most of the genotype coefficients are related to grain and yield therefore the default values of winter wheat cultivar newton in dssat were utilized except for the phint coefficient described in table 4 all the parameters used to calibrate the cereal rye biomass are presented in table 4 the cereal rye biomass was calibrated in the maize soybean sequence of fcc and validated in the scc treatment after the cereal rye growth calibration the genotype coefficients of maize and soybean were adjusted to calibrate their biomass and yield tables 5 and 6 since the in situ maize cultivars for the years 2015 and 2017 and soybean cultivars for the years 2016 and 2018 were different both the cultivars genotype coefficients for both crops were calibrated separately for fall n application treatments fcc fn and validated for spring n application treatments scc sn the model performance for tile drainage and nitrate loss via tile drainage were estimated using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean squared error rmse and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr rmse standard deviation of the observations recommended by moriasi et al 2007 the coefficient of determination cd r2 was also used to compare the observed and simulated cereal rye biomass the lower rmse with rsr less than or equal to 0 70 nse greater than equal to 0 50 r2 greater than or equal to 0 50 are considered satisfactory in agroecological modeling moriasi et al 2007 the model performance for crop biomass and yield for cereal rye and other cash crops were measured using percentage difference and data visualization between simulated and observed data due to limited experimental data availability 2 4 cereal rye impact assessment the calibrated and validated model was utilized to assess cereal rye s impact on soil water and nitrogen dynamics to investigate the impact of cover crop in reducing nitrate loss and tile drainage simulated nitrate loss via tile drains and tile drainage in cover crop treatments fcc and scc were compared to those from without cover crop treatments fn and sn the overall reduction in tile drainage and nitrate loss due to cereal rye as a winter cover crop was compared with obeserved values a comparative analysis of model based outcomes against observed change in cash crop growth and induced mineralization due to the cereal rye inclusion was also conducted the impact of n fertilization timing along with the introduction of cereal rye effect on different aspects of agroecosystem were also examined 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance 3 1 1 cereal rye growth the ceres wheat model of dssat with winter wheat cultivar performed well calibration r2 0 94 validation r2 0 91 in replicating cereal rye growth in maize soybean rotation after calibration fig 1 a shows the cereal rye biomass calibration on fcc treatment from 2014 to 2018 the average simulated and observed biomass at termination observation date were found to be 854 and 995 kg ha respectively fig 1 b shows the cereal rye biomass validation on scc treatment from 2014 to 2018 the calibrated model predicted the average cover crop biomass to be 877 kg ha for scc treatment while the observed biomass was 1033 kg ha the model overpredicted the cereal rye biomass by 8 2 for 2014 15 for fcc treatment and underpredicted by 10 9 for 2015 16 for scc treatment compared to the average observed biomass the year 2017 18 had the coldest winter during the study period which impacted the cereal rye growth drastically reducing the observed biomass by 50 and 43 compared to the average observed values for fcc and scc treatments the model performance was poor in 2017 18 with underestimation of cereal rye biomass by 44 3 simulated value 276 kg ha observed value 496 kg ha for fcc treatment and by 51 5 simulated value 286 kg ha observed value 590 kg ha for scc treatment due to the warm winter in 2016 17 the cereal rye biomass increased to 2208 kg ha for fcc and 2186 kg ha for scc treatments in contrast the model underpredicted the cereal rye biomass by 20 5 for fcc and 19 2 for scc treatments the model was not successful in replicating the observed biomass in the extreme climatic conditions harsh and warm winter years with similar efficiency as in other years however it should be noted that the daily biomass in all the years shadowed the gdd curve considerably well r2 0 82 the average fcc and scc simulated n uptake for cereal rye were 21 4 14 9 37 6 and 2 6 kg n ha for 2014 15 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 respectively in contrast the average fcc and scc observed n uptake for cereal rye were 53 5 31 4 80 9 and 16 6 kg n ha for the same period the simulated cereal rye biomass to n uptake ratio ranged from 46 8 to 74 6 kg biomass kg n uptake for all the years except in the year 2017 18 with 98 6 and 120 0 kg biomass kg n uptake in the fcc and the scc treatment respectively singer et al 2011 also simulated similar cereal rye biomass to n uptake ratio which ranged from 34 4 to 88 8 kg biomass kg n uptake in maize soybean rotation using ceres wheat model in rzwqm on average the cereal rye n uptake was underpredicted by the ceres wheat model of dssat for both fcc as well as scc treatment ranging from 53 to 84 this underprediction may be attributed to the fact that wheat accumulates less nitrogen than cereal rye paponov et al 1999 similarly another plausible reason can be the changes made to the parue and la1s ecotype parameter values of winter wheat cultivar used to calibrate the model for cereal rye biomass in the dssat model 3 1 2 cash crop growth the dssat model overpredicted the average maize yield of all the years by 2 2 for fcc treatment and underpredicted by 13 4 for fn treatment compared to observed results table 7 the trend was similar for scc and sn treatments as the model overpredicted the average annual maize yield for all the years by 0 9 for scc treatment and underpredicted by 16 3 for sn treatment average soybean yields in all the years were overestimated by 6 4 and 5 6 under fcc and scc treatments respectively the average soybean yields were underestimated by 0 9 in fn treatment by the dssat model while the model was able to match the observed soybean yield in sn treatment the model simulated nitrogen uptake by maize ranged from 265 to 323 kg ha with an average value of 285 290 306 and 301 kg ha for fcc fn scc and sn respectively for 246 5 kg ha n of average n fertilizer application during maize year the research conducted by dattamudi et al 2020 on agricultural nitrogen budget in the little vermillion river watershed in illinois reported 223 kg ha of average nitrogen uptake with 192 kg ha of n fertilization these findings suggest that the simulated n uptake values in this research are realistic in soybean the total nitrogen uptake ranged from 282 to 308 kg ha in all the treatments the average nitrogen uptake by soybean was found to be 295 and 296 kg ha in the treatments with cover crop and the treatments without cover crop respectively with 86 and 85 of average atmospheric nitrogen fixation salvagiotti et al 2008 reported the nitrogen fixation percentage of total nitrogen uptake could be as high as 98 without any n fertilization in soybean crops 3 1 3 tile drainage and nitrate loss through tile drainage simulated daily cumulative tile drainage flow and nitrate loss through tile drainage were compared against observed values to examine the model performance for soil water and n dynamic for calibration and validation treatments fig 2 shows the comparison between simulated and observed daily cumulative tile drainage and nitrate loss for the fcc and fn treatments used for calibration it is evident from the figure that the model was able to replicate not only the pattern but also the cumulative values of tile drainage and nitrate loss via tile drains for tile drainage rsr and nse were 0 20 and 0 96 for fcc and 0 29 and 0 92 for fn for nitrate loss through tile drainage rsr and nse values were 0 30 and 0 91 for fcc and 0 28 and 0 92 for fn respectively these results indicate that the calibrated model successfully reproduced the flow through tile drainage and nitrate loss in the flow the model was also able to capture the differences in the flow and nitrate loss due to cereal rye fcc vs fn fig 3 shows the comparison between simulated and observed daily cumulative tile drainage and nitrate loss for the scc and sn treatments used for validation the nse values for tile drainage and nitrate loss validation results on scc were 0 75 and 0 74 respectively the rsr values for tile drainage and nitrate loss validation results on scc were 0 50 and 0 51 respectively for sn treatment the rsr and nse values for tile drainage were 0 50 and 0 75 and same for nitrate loss were 0 52 and 0 72 respectively hence the rsr and nse values for tile drainage and nitrate loss through tile drains during both calibration and validation can be considered good as per moriasi et al 2007 the decrease in the model performance during validation could be related to the differences in the field topography or the soils amongst the plots used for different treatments fcc vs scc and fn vs sn the observed tile drainage in scc and sn treatments were observed to be 27 and 10 higher as compared to fcc and fn respectively however the model failed to reproduce such differences in the tile drainage with the changes in fertilization timing the ssurgo soil database provides the average values for field topography soil hydrology and layered soil profile for a large map unit and it might provide a single value for all the plots however the soil information could vary at the plot scale soil properties of the plots used for fcc fn might be different than scc sn which could explain the model s inability to reproduce similar efficiency in the validation scc sn like in calibration fcc fn the difference in observed tile drainage between fall n and spring n application treatments was also reflected in the nitrate loss through tile drain since the nitrate loss via tile drains is linked with the tile drainage 3 2 cereal rye impact assessment 3 2 1 cereal rye impact on nitrate loss and tile drainage the modeled nitrate loss and tile drainage results confirmed that cereal rye inclusion as a winter cover crop reduced nutrient loss through the sub surface drainage system the total nitrate losses in the cc and the ncc treatments with fall n application were simulated to be 68 2 kg ha for fcc and 120 8 kg ha for fn reducing the total nitrate n loss by 43 6 48 6 observed table 8 similarly the simulated nitrate loss reduced from 116 3 kg ha to 63 5 kg ha reduced by 45 4 in simulation and 47 8 in observation in spring dominated n application due to cover crop inclusion scc vs sn even with the change in n fertilization timing there was no major difference in nitrate loss reduction due to cover crop neither in simulated values nor observed based on the model results 75 0 and 77 7 kg ha of nitrogen uptake by cereal rye in the fcc and the scc treatment respectively from 2014 to 18 reduced the nitrate n loss via tile drains by 52 6 and 52 8 kg ha however the 195 0 and 169 6 kg ha of n uptake by cereal rye in the fcc and the scc treatment respectively were observed to reduce 65 2 and 70 3 kg ha of no3 n loss via tile drains in four years the simulated tile drainage volume also reduced due to cereal rye inclusion from 1409 to 1109 mm in the treatment with fall n application and 1403 1108 mm in the treatment with spring n application with an average 21 reduction in tile drainage volume table 8 the model underestimated the reduction in tile drainage reduction due to cover crop inclusion by approximately 10 for the fall n application treatments fcc vs fn however there was no substantial difference in simulated and observed tile drainage reduction for the treatments with spring n application 3 2 2 impact of cereal rye on soil water balance the soil water balance components precipitation p deep percolation dp tile drainage td evapotranspiration et runoff r and changes in soil water storage s were considered while following tile drainage calibration procedure to check on the simulated plant scale hydrology by the model the simulated values for different hydrological components are presented in table 9 for each crop year from 2014 to 2018 the et as the percentage of p varied from 48 6 to 82 3 in all the years and treatments an increase in et was observed in the soybean years 2015 16 and 2017 18 in the cc treatments as compared to ncc treatments fcc vs fn and scc vs sn however the simulated results showed a decrease in et due to cover crop in the maize years 2014 15 and 2016 17 the et increased by 12 4 during the cover crop period in cc treatments on an average compared to ncc treatments table s2 a considerable impact on the td 21 reduction was observed due to cereal rye inclusion in the winters this effect could be attributed to a diversion of tile drainage water to increase et due to the cereal rye and to the dp table s2 it was noted that there was dp flow in cc treatments whereas there was no dp flow found in ncc treatments this could be due to the soil drainage rate parameter sldr which was adjusted from 0 04 cc treatments to 0 01 in ncc treatments during calibration this might have restricted the drainage water from deep percolation 3 2 3 cereal rye impact on cash crops the overall simulated impact of cereal rye on maize and soybean yields was found to be contrary to experimental findings the observed maize yield decreased by 11 7 on average due to cereal rye inclusion for fall n application fcc vs fn and by 12 6 for spring n application scc vs sn on the contrary the modeled maize yield increased by 4 2 for the fall fcc vs fn n application and 5 3 for the spring scc vs sn n application an analogous discrepancy was identified for the soybean yield when the observed and modeled yields were compared on the field the soybean yield decreased by 2 2 and 5 0 for fcc vs fn and scc vs sn respectively however the simulated yield increased by 4 8 for the fall fcc vs fn n application and by 0 3 for the spring scc vs sn n application these discrepancies in the cash crop yields could be due to higher n mineralization simulated by the model there was no significant variation observed in the impact of cereal rye on maize due to changes in the fertilization timing overall the model failed to replicate the impact of cover crop on maize and soybean yield as observed in the field experiments several studies reported no significant impact or positive impact of cereal rye on the cash crop grown in the long run decade or more basche et al 2016a 2016b kuo and jellum 2000 qi et al 2011 however for a short period up to five years the cereal rye could negatively impact the cash crop growth leuthold et al 2021 roth et al 2018 ruffatti et al 2019 a substantial impact of cereal rye was noted in the nitrogen uptake in soybean due to increased simulated mineralization amid cereal rye inclusion the nitrogen uptake in maize was found to have mixed results decrease in fall dominated n application and increase in spring dominated n application the modeled results showed a increase by 11 1 on average in mineralized n due to the cover crop inclusion an increase in mineralization due to cover cropping was noted to be higher ranging between 11 and 54 in maize years in contrast it ranged from 5 4 in soybean years in the simulated condition the n immobilization increased by 7 9 on average due to the cover cropping moreover the net mineralization mineralization minus immobilization also increased by 14 3 due to planting cereal rye in the maize soybean rotation in simulated condition these model results are in contrast to the observations found under field conditions where a reduction in net mineralization was observed with the presence of cereal rye due to increased n immobilization occurs with a high c n ratio of cereal rye residue basche et al 2016b nevins et al 2020 roth et al 2018 ruffatti et al 2019 the increased n immobilization in the field condition is related to high cereal rye root c n instead of its shoot c n martinez feria et al 2016 also found a similar reasoning for high n immobilization possibility related to cereal rye due to higher c n ratio and higher biomass of its roots compared to that of the shoot this could have impacted the maize n uptake negatively and hence decreased the maize yield in the observed condition the model s weakness in replicating n immobilization could be due to the chemical termination of cereal rye used and the presence of tillage radish in the field in the field experiments the tillage radish was also incorporated along with the cereal rye the radish was winter terminated in december however the cereal rye kept growing until mid april since dssat does not support intercropping feature presently the experiments were modeled using the cereal rye alone since the radish residue is high in n content low c n mixing it with cereal rye high c n reduces c n ratio to the optimum level promoting the mineralization in the field condition ruffatti et al 2019 moreover the chemical application glyphosate used for chemical termination of cereal rye also affects the natural decomposition process and hence could affect the n mineralization immobilization process which was not captured well by the model snapp and borden 2005 observed that glyphosate application 8 days before cover crop termination enhanced the residual decomposition however it also reduced the amount of residue by half approximately compared to untreated cover crop termination the decreased net mineralization observed in the field experiment could also be linked with the reduction in the cereal rye radish residue available for decomposition caused by glyphosate application since the current version of dssat does not support the chemical termination the cereal rye was harvested leaving all its biomass on the field to begin the natural decomposition process therefore the model simulated the increased net mineralization due to untreated termination of cereal rye consequently it led to the failure in replicating the cash crop growth observed in the field particularly for the maize the other possible reasons could be allelopathy increase in maize growth damaging pests or increased pathogens population hosted by cereal rye causing maize seedling disease for causing a detrimental impact on maize yield bakker et al 2016 4 conclusion the modified ceres wheat model in the dssat model did fairly well in replicating the cereal rye growth after carefully fixing temperature related parameters to make the crop thrive on the shorter days and freezing temperatures the soil water and nitrogen results confirmed the reliability of the dssat model in predicting the cereal rye as a winter cover crop inclusion impact on nitrate loss and tile drainage volume due to the absence of the chemical termination feature in the dssat the model could not capture the n mineralization immobilization process that affected its prediction of maize n uptake and maize yield thus the development of the chemical termination routine in the model could enhance the understanding of the cover crop induced impact studies in the field condition the cereal rye and tillage radish seeds were broadcasted into the standing maize soybean crop before harvesting with an overlap of 20 25 days on average however dssat cannot simulate the growth of multiple crops simultaneously which might have affected the results overall the findings revealed that no3 n loss from the field could decrease by 43 6 and 45 4 for fall applied and spring applied n fertilizer treatments respectively moreover cereal rye can potentially reduce the tile drainage volume by approximately 21 even though the model performed poorly in simulating the impact of cereal rye cover crop on the subsequent cash crop yield the insightful findings on soil water n dynamics encourage the use of the model for agricultural policymaking at a large scale and the long term impact assessment

9352,increasing demand for food has amplified the use of fertilizer intensive agriculture practices in the upper mississippi basin have been linked to the formation of a hypoxic zone in the gulf of mexico previous studies have recommended the use of winter cover crop in the maize soybean rotation as an eco efficient solution in reducing the nitrate nitrogen no3 n loss via a sub surface drainage system therefore the objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of cereal rye as a winter cover crop in the maize soybean system on reducing nutrient loss via tile drainage using the dssat model the experiments include four treatments with a combination of two different nitrogen n application timing with cover crop cc and without cover crop ncc fall applied n without cover crop fn spring applied n without cover crop sn fall applied n with cover crop fcc and spring applied n with cover crop scc the calibrated dssat model was utilized to assess the impact of the cover crop by comparing no3 n losses and cash crop yields between cc and ncc treatments for different n fertilization timings the model calibrated for cereal rye biomass in the fcc treatment estimated the observed cereal rye growth for scc treatment considerably well r2 0 91 the model successfully predicted the impact of cereal rye on nitrate loss and tile drainage with 43 6 and 45 4 48 6 and 47 8 observed nitrate loss reduction and 21 3 and 21 0 30 2 and 19 4 observed tile drainage volume reduction in fall and spring n application treatments respectively the results from this research suggest that dssat can predict the cereal rye growth and assess the soil water nutrient dynamics in both cc and ncc systems however the model was not able to replicate the impact of cereal rye on the cash crop yields due to the higher n mineralization simulated in the cc compared to the ncc treatments this could be due to the use of glyphosate to terminate the cereal rye and the presence of tillage radish along with the cereal rye the glyphosate application hastens the decomposition process however it also reduces the overall residue the chemical termination and intercropping feature are not available in the dssat model currently the cereal rye hosted pathogens and pests might also be responsible for lowering maize yield in the observations graphical abstract ga1 keywords cereal rye maize soybean soil nitrate nitrogen soil drainage water nitrate nitrogen loss data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the demand for maize and soybean is expected to increase to ensure the food security of the increasing population godfray et al 2010 to meet the food demand the corn belt in the midwest region of the united states us with over 52 million ha of agricultural land plays a crucial role by contributing up to one third of global maize and soybean production fao 2018 usda nass 2020 a substantial amount of nitrogen n based fertilizer is applied every year on agricultural land to achieve high crop yields in the region cao et al 2018 intensive farming practices in the mississippi river basin mrb have been attributed to environmental issues like hypoxia formation biodiversity degradation and habitat loss at the gulf of mexico rabalais et al 2001 rabalais and turner 2019 the nitrate leaching from agricultural lands in the midwest regions is not only responsible for creating the hypoxia zone of the gulf of mexico but also degrading the water quality within the region excessive nitrate a byproduct of n fertilizer leaches below the vadose zone and is carried away through the artificial natural surface subsurface flow to creeks and streams to the mississippi river turner et al 2006 alexander et al 2008 found that more than half of the nitrate load in mrb is generated by the corn belt region alone due to shallow water table depth and poorly drained soil a subsurface tile drainage system is popular in the upper mrb region to sustain agricultural productivity according to the 2017 census of agriculture from the united states department of agriculture usda 39 5 of the total cropland 97 137 km2 in the state of illinois is tile drained usda 2019 the tile drained farmlands in illinois are the state s largest contributor of nitrate load to the mrb david et al 2010 several studies have identified various solutions like altering n application timing winter cover crop crop rotation conservation tillage etc to reduce nitrate loss through the subsurface drainage in the mrb region dinnes et al 2002 jeong and bhattarai 2018 luo et al 2010 singh et al 2020 strock et al 2004 growing winter cover crops in the maize soybean rotation were found to be one of the economically viable methods in reducing nitrate loss to drainage channels dabney et al 2010 dinnes et al 2002 strock et al 2004 several previous studies have repoted that the use of cereal rye as a winter cover crop not only reduces the overall drainage volume but also helps in reducing nitrate loss through tile drainage system baker and griffis 2009 feyereisen et al 2006 lacey and armstrong 2015 malone et al 2014 ruffatti et al 2019 feyereisen et al 2006 concluded that the cereal rye used as a winter cover crop was able to reduce nitrate loss by more than 11 in southwestern minnesota they also estimated the potential of more than a 30 reduction of nitrate loss by increasing the span of cereal rye growth by a month a long term impact of cereal rye on soil n budget by qi et al 2011 reported the reduction of annual tile drainage by 11 and nitrate loss by 22 in iowa computer simulation models are helpful in investigating the impact of several alternate management practices in the short term or the impact of agricultural management practices in the long term due to the budgetary and human capital limitations the advancement of the process based crop simulation model has also helped researchers and scientists to interpret the nexus of climate variables crop management and soil n water dynamics the persistent improvements in the crop modeling field have contributed to developing several adaptation mitigation strategies and economic policies in the agriculture domain maiorano et al 2017 several crop models have been used to understand the phenology of cereal rye as a winter cover crop and foresee its impact on the maize soybean system and soil water nitrogen dynamics to reduce nitrate loss via subsurface drainage channels basche et al 2016a feyereisen et al 2006 malone et al 2017 2014 yeo et al 2014 to our knowledge there are no studies that have used decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat jones et al 2003 without its integration with any other models to simulate cereal rye growth as a winter cover crop and analyze its impact on soil nitrogen water dynamics in the maize soybean rotation therefore the present study is focused on examining the impact of cereal rye as a winter cover crop on soil n water dynamics using dssat dssat is an interface that integrates results from different crop models with more than 42 crops allowing multi year sequential simulations however it does not have a separate model to simulate the growth of cereal rye similar characteristics of cereal rye and winter wheat led several researchers to utilize the ceres crop environment resource synthesis wheat model of dssat as a proxy model to simulate the cereal rye growth for example kladivko et al 2014 malone et al 2017 qi et al 2011 and singer et al 2011 used ceres wheat model as a crop component of root zone water quality model rzwqm apart from similarities cereal rye is more tolerant to the harsh winter temperature 25 to 35 c than winter wheat 0 10 c due to this the majority of the previous studies which used dssat with its integration with rzwqm altered the weather parameters especially minimum temperature to imitate the growth of cereal rye kladivko et al 2014 malone et al 2017 qi et al 2011 singer et al 2011 likewise leuthold et al 2021 also utilized the ceres wheat model of dssat to predict the cereal rye biomass in kentucky it should be noted that the winters are not severe enough to impact the cereal wheat growth in kentucky therefore adjusting a few genotype coefficients of the winter wheat cultivar of dssat worked well for leuthold et al 2021 to simulate cereal rye biomass however we modified a few ecotype and species type coefficients along with genotype coefficients of a winter wheat cultivar available in the ceres wheat model to replicate the cereal rye growth in this study dssat has been one of the most recognized models in rationally accessing the linkage of crop growth and development with environmental changes and management practices globally however several researchers have criticized its subsurface drainage and soil nitrogen modules for its weak performance boote and jones 2013 liu et al 2011b 2011a negm et al 2014 therefore in this research a bug in the source codes of the soil nitrogen module of dssat was identified and resolved to appropriately compute the nitrate nitrogen loss via tile drainage these modifications are incorporated in the latest version of dssat v4 7 5 please refer to section 2 2 for more details on the bug resolved therefore the capability of the dssat v4 7 5 to reproduce soil water nitrogen dynamics in a maize soybean rotation system with cereal rye as a winter cover crop was tested in this study based on these identified knowledge gaps the objectives of our research are i to calibrate and validate the dssat model for cereal rye biomass in the maize soybean rotation using its ceres wheat model ii to calibrate and validate the model for the tile drainage and nitrate loss via tile drains and iii to analyze the impact of cereal rye as a winter cover crop on soil water nitrogen budget and cash crop growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment detail the field experiments were conducted at illinois state university nitrogen management research field station lexington il usa 40 64 n 88 72 w ruffatti et al 2019 the research site is relatively flat 0 2 slopes and contains drummer and el paso silty clay loam soils the experimental site is equipped with a tile drainage system 13 7 m apart at 0 9 m depth due to the inadequate drainage capability of the soil for this research the maize soybean rotation was implemented for four years from sep 2014 to oct 2018 table 1 the seed mixture of cereal rye and tillage radish as the winter cover crops in the ratio of 92 8 by weight was surface broadcasted during the late fall season using a self propelled sprayer modified with an air seeding box hagie sts12 hagie manufacturing company clarion iowa us the cereal rye was chemically terminated using glyphosate herbicide at 2 34 liters ha termination dates are reported in table 1 maize and soybeans were planted using a john deere 1770 n t 24 row planter no till with a target seed rate of 8 65 seeds m2 8 35 plants m2 emerged and 44 5 seeds m2 34 8 plants m2 emerged respectively table s1 there were 12 experimental plots 0 65 ha each with three replications with four treatments two fertilizer application routines i e fall and spring split nitrogen n application and two winter cover crop scenarios i e cover crop cc and no cover crop ncc hence the treatments in this study include fcc fall split n application with cc fn fall split n application without cc scc spring split n application with cc sn spring split n application without cc table s1 please refer to ruffatti et al 2019 for more details 2 2 model description and inputs dssat is an interface that combines several cropping system models capable of understanding crop growth and development along with soil water nitrogen and carbon models to assess the soil water nitrogen dynamics hoogenboom et al 2010 jones et al 2003 dssat can integrate the simulation outcomes of a long sequence of crop rotations with a variety of crop land management decisions and environmental options as a function of the soil crop climate dynamics jones et al 2010 the present study uses dssat v4 7 5 which can simulate the growth yield and biomass of more than 42 crops however there is still no specific crop model for simulating cereal rye growth therefore the ceres wheat model of dssat was used as a proxy model for cereal rye growth simulation the ceres maize and cropgro soybean models of dssat were used to simulate the growth of cereal maize and soybean respectively in the present study soil hydrology and organic matter were computed using the ritchie water balance approach and century model respectively the infiltrated water which is the subtraction of runoff estimated by modified usda soil conservation service curve scs curve number method from precipitation was used to estimate the downward water flux the downward flux of water and the drainage coefficient along with soil lower limit wilting point drained upper limit field capacity of soil and saturated soil water content were utilized to determine the water drained from each soil layer to estimate the tile drainage the earlier version of dssat before v4 7 5 did not simulate the soil nitrogen balance properly it was missing the nitrate loss via tile drains nltd component from the soil n balance and dssat output therefore the bug was identified and fixed as a part of this study it was a minor issue in the dssat source codes the earlier version of the model calculated nltd for the soil layer with the tile drain however it did not subtract the nltd component from the n flux of that layer disrupting the soil n balance a simple equation to add the nltd component in soil n balance was introduced to fix the problem in n flux calculation resolving this issue did not require adding any new methodology to the source codes rather a small bug in the source code of dssat was fixed to produce the nltd component in the dssat outputs and accurately predict the soil n balance the changes were reported to the dssat development team who incorporated them in the next release the latest version of dssat v4 7 5 used in this study already incorporated these changes in the source codes daily precipitation solar radiation wind speed with minimum and maximum temperatures were recorded by a weather station available at the experimental site the layered soil information of bulk density lower upper drained limits saturated soil water content and soil organic carbon content was collected from the recent ssurgo soil survey geographic database for modeling purposes the experiment based crop management information for instance planting harvesting date plant density fertilizer application timing and rate and tillage were added into dssat table s1 the tile drainage was recorded using a data logger installed in the water level control structures while tile nitrate concentrations were measured in a laboratory the crop biomass was estimated at a laboratory while the crop yields were measured at the field 2 3 model calibration validation and evaluation the model was set up and ran for seven years 2012 18 the first two years 2012 14 were used as the warm up period to establish the initial soil conditions and the results from 2014 to 18 were utilized to calibrate and validate the model the process of calibrating dssat was segregated into several steps in the following order soil water nitrogen balance cereal rye growth and cash crop growth calibration for calibrating the soil water balance the daily observed tile drainage values were compared with the simulated tile drainage for the soil nitrogen balance daily observed nitrate loss through tile drainage was compared with simulated values the soil parameters field capacity wilting point saturated water content bulk density and organic carbon collected from ssurgo database were used to estimate the soil properties at the required soil horizon using linear interpolation later these soil properties were adjusted to calibrate the model for the soil water nitrogen dynamics soil root growth factor srgf was calculated as using an equation srgf exp 0 02 center of layers for center of layers 20 otherwise srgf 1 wilkens et al 2004 tables 2 and 3 soil water balance and partitioning of precipitation into the evapotranspiration tile drainage deep percolation runoff and soil water retained released were verified with other similar studies in illinois jeong et al 2019 singh et al 2020 the cover crop can alter the soil properties for example it can increase field capacity saturated soil water content organic carbon content and decrease bulk density basche and delonge 2017 rorick and kladivko 2017 therefore an approach to calibrate the treatment with the cover crop fcc and without cover crop fn individually was adapted to optimize the set of soil parameters for each treatment separately the soil bulk density organic carbon content field capacity and saturated water content were optimized primarily to calibrate fn treatment after calibrating fcc treatment another important soil parameter in dssat for controlling tile drainage was sldr related to per day drainage rate slrd for fcc and fn was calibrated to 0 04 and 0 01 respectively the soil properties calibrated for fcc and fn treatments were utilized to validate the model on scc and sn treatments respectively for soil water and nitrogen budget after the soil water nitrogen budget calibration the crop biomass and yield calibration were conducted to simulate the whole agroecological system the calibration process was initiated with the cereal rye biomass calibration followed by maize soybean biomass and yield calibration since the dssat does not provide a separate model to predict the cereal rye growth the ceres wheat model was used as a surrogate model due to the similarities in the phenological properties of winter wheat and cereal rye however these two crops have different tolerance capacities for low temperatures the high tolerance capacity of cereal rye for the midwest s harsh climate makes it a suitable winter cover crop in the region cereal rye can sustain in temperatures as low as 35 c whereas the lowest viable temperature for winter wheat is 10 c therefore the temperature related parameters in dssat were adjusted to prevent the cereal rye plant from hardening hence dropping the biomass suddenly due to lower temperatures in the winter table 4 a similar approach was used by basche et al 2016a to replicate the observed cereal rye biomass using the wheat module of the apsim model other parameters in the ecotype coefficient file were related to photosynthetically active radiation usage and leaf area most of the genotype coefficients are related to grain and yield therefore the default values of winter wheat cultivar newton in dssat were utilized except for the phint coefficient described in table 4 all the parameters used to calibrate the cereal rye biomass are presented in table 4 the cereal rye biomass was calibrated in the maize soybean sequence of fcc and validated in the scc treatment after the cereal rye growth calibration the genotype coefficients of maize and soybean were adjusted to calibrate their biomass and yield tables 5 and 6 since the in situ maize cultivars for the years 2015 and 2017 and soybean cultivars for the years 2016 and 2018 were different both the cultivars genotype coefficients for both crops were calibrated separately for fall n application treatments fcc fn and validated for spring n application treatments scc sn the model performance for tile drainage and nitrate loss via tile drainage were estimated using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean squared error rmse and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr rmse standard deviation of the observations recommended by moriasi et al 2007 the coefficient of determination cd r2 was also used to compare the observed and simulated cereal rye biomass the lower rmse with rsr less than or equal to 0 70 nse greater than equal to 0 50 r2 greater than or equal to 0 50 are considered satisfactory in agroecological modeling moriasi et al 2007 the model performance for crop biomass and yield for cereal rye and other cash crops were measured using percentage difference and data visualization between simulated and observed data due to limited experimental data availability 2 4 cereal rye impact assessment the calibrated and validated model was utilized to assess cereal rye s impact on soil water and nitrogen dynamics to investigate the impact of cover crop in reducing nitrate loss and tile drainage simulated nitrate loss via tile drains and tile drainage in cover crop treatments fcc and scc were compared to those from without cover crop treatments fn and sn the overall reduction in tile drainage and nitrate loss due to cereal rye as a winter cover crop was compared with obeserved values a comparative analysis of model based outcomes against observed change in cash crop growth and induced mineralization due to the cereal rye inclusion was also conducted the impact of n fertilization timing along with the introduction of cereal rye effect on different aspects of agroecosystem were also examined 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance 3 1 1 cereal rye growth the ceres wheat model of dssat with winter wheat cultivar performed well calibration r2 0 94 validation r2 0 91 in replicating cereal rye growth in maize soybean rotation after calibration fig 1 a shows the cereal rye biomass calibration on fcc treatment from 2014 to 2018 the average simulated and observed biomass at termination observation date were found to be 854 and 995 kg ha respectively fig 1 b shows the cereal rye biomass validation on scc treatment from 2014 to 2018 the calibrated model predicted the average cover crop biomass to be 877 kg ha for scc treatment while the observed biomass was 1033 kg ha the model overpredicted the cereal rye biomass by 8 2 for 2014 15 for fcc treatment and underpredicted by 10 9 for 2015 16 for scc treatment compared to the average observed biomass the year 2017 18 had the coldest winter during the study period which impacted the cereal rye growth drastically reducing the observed biomass by 50 and 43 compared to the average observed values for fcc and scc treatments the model performance was poor in 2017 18 with underestimation of cereal rye biomass by 44 3 simulated value 276 kg ha observed value 496 kg ha for fcc treatment and by 51 5 simulated value 286 kg ha observed value 590 kg ha for scc treatment due to the warm winter in 2016 17 the cereal rye biomass increased to 2208 kg ha for fcc and 2186 kg ha for scc treatments in contrast the model underpredicted the cereal rye biomass by 20 5 for fcc and 19 2 for scc treatments the model was not successful in replicating the observed biomass in the extreme climatic conditions harsh and warm winter years with similar efficiency as in other years however it should be noted that the daily biomass in all the years shadowed the gdd curve considerably well r2 0 82 the average fcc and scc simulated n uptake for cereal rye were 21 4 14 9 37 6 and 2 6 kg n ha for 2014 15 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 respectively in contrast the average fcc and scc observed n uptake for cereal rye were 53 5 31 4 80 9 and 16 6 kg n ha for the same period the simulated cereal rye biomass to n uptake ratio ranged from 46 8 to 74 6 kg biomass kg n uptake for all the years except in the year 2017 18 with 98 6 and 120 0 kg biomass kg n uptake in the fcc and the scc treatment respectively singer et al 2011 also simulated similar cereal rye biomass to n uptake ratio which ranged from 34 4 to 88 8 kg biomass kg n uptake in maize soybean rotation using ceres wheat model in rzwqm on average the cereal rye n uptake was underpredicted by the ceres wheat model of dssat for both fcc as well as scc treatment ranging from 53 to 84 this underprediction may be attributed to the fact that wheat accumulates less nitrogen than cereal rye paponov et al 1999 similarly another plausible reason can be the changes made to the parue and la1s ecotype parameter values of winter wheat cultivar used to calibrate the model for cereal rye biomass in the dssat model 3 1 2 cash crop growth the dssat model overpredicted the average maize yield of all the years by 2 2 for fcc treatment and underpredicted by 13 4 for fn treatment compared to observed results table 7 the trend was similar for scc and sn treatments as the model overpredicted the average annual maize yield for all the years by 0 9 for scc treatment and underpredicted by 16 3 for sn treatment average soybean yields in all the years were overestimated by 6 4 and 5 6 under fcc and scc treatments respectively the average soybean yields were underestimated by 0 9 in fn treatment by the dssat model while the model was able to match the observed soybean yield in sn treatment the model simulated nitrogen uptake by maize ranged from 265 to 323 kg ha with an average value of 285 290 306 and 301 kg ha for fcc fn scc and sn respectively for 246 5 kg ha n of average n fertilizer application during maize year the research conducted by dattamudi et al 2020 on agricultural nitrogen budget in the little vermillion river watershed in illinois reported 223 kg ha of average nitrogen uptake with 192 kg ha of n fertilization these findings suggest that the simulated n uptake values in this research are realistic in soybean the total nitrogen uptake ranged from 282 to 308 kg ha in all the treatments the average nitrogen uptake by soybean was found to be 295 and 296 kg ha in the treatments with cover crop and the treatments without cover crop respectively with 86 and 85 of average atmospheric nitrogen fixation salvagiotti et al 2008 reported the nitrogen fixation percentage of total nitrogen uptake could be as high as 98 without any n fertilization in soybean crops 3 1 3 tile drainage and nitrate loss through tile drainage simulated daily cumulative tile drainage flow and nitrate loss through tile drainage were compared against observed values to examine the model performance for soil water and n dynamic for calibration and validation treatments fig 2 shows the comparison between simulated and observed daily cumulative tile drainage and nitrate loss for the fcc and fn treatments used for calibration it is evident from the figure that the model was able to replicate not only the pattern but also the cumulative values of tile drainage and nitrate loss via tile drains for tile drainage rsr and nse were 0 20 and 0 96 for fcc and 0 29 and 0 92 for fn for nitrate loss through tile drainage rsr and nse values were 0 30 and 0 91 for fcc and 0 28 and 0 92 for fn respectively these results indicate that the calibrated model successfully reproduced the flow through tile drainage and nitrate loss in the flow the model was also able to capture the differences in the flow and nitrate loss due to cereal rye fcc vs fn fig 3 shows the comparison between simulated and observed daily cumulative tile drainage and nitrate loss for the scc and sn treatments used for validation the nse values for tile drainage and nitrate loss validation results on scc were 0 75 and 0 74 respectively the rsr values for tile drainage and nitrate loss validation results on scc were 0 50 and 0 51 respectively for sn treatment the rsr and nse values for tile drainage were 0 50 and 0 75 and same for nitrate loss were 0 52 and 0 72 respectively hence the rsr and nse values for tile drainage and nitrate loss through tile drains during both calibration and validation can be considered good as per moriasi et al 2007 the decrease in the model performance during validation could be related to the differences in the field topography or the soils amongst the plots used for different treatments fcc vs scc and fn vs sn the observed tile drainage in scc and sn treatments were observed to be 27 and 10 higher as compared to fcc and fn respectively however the model failed to reproduce such differences in the tile drainage with the changes in fertilization timing the ssurgo soil database provides the average values for field topography soil hydrology and layered soil profile for a large map unit and it might provide a single value for all the plots however the soil information could vary at the plot scale soil properties of the plots used for fcc fn might be different than scc sn which could explain the model s inability to reproduce similar efficiency in the validation scc sn like in calibration fcc fn the difference in observed tile drainage between fall n and spring n application treatments was also reflected in the nitrate loss through tile drain since the nitrate loss via tile drains is linked with the tile drainage 3 2 cereal rye impact assessment 3 2 1 cereal rye impact on nitrate loss and tile drainage the modeled nitrate loss and tile drainage results confirmed that cereal rye inclusion as a winter cover crop reduced nutrient loss through the sub surface drainage system the total nitrate losses in the cc and the ncc treatments with fall n application were simulated to be 68 2 kg ha for fcc and 120 8 kg ha for fn reducing the total nitrate n loss by 43 6 48 6 observed table 8 similarly the simulated nitrate loss reduced from 116 3 kg ha to 63 5 kg ha reduced by 45 4 in simulation and 47 8 in observation in spring dominated n application due to cover crop inclusion scc vs sn even with the change in n fertilization timing there was no major difference in nitrate loss reduction due to cover crop neither in simulated values nor observed based on the model results 75 0 and 77 7 kg ha of nitrogen uptake by cereal rye in the fcc and the scc treatment respectively from 2014 to 18 reduced the nitrate n loss via tile drains by 52 6 and 52 8 kg ha however the 195 0 and 169 6 kg ha of n uptake by cereal rye in the fcc and the scc treatment respectively were observed to reduce 65 2 and 70 3 kg ha of no3 n loss via tile drains in four years the simulated tile drainage volume also reduced due to cereal rye inclusion from 1409 to 1109 mm in the treatment with fall n application and 1403 1108 mm in the treatment with spring n application with an average 21 reduction in tile drainage volume table 8 the model underestimated the reduction in tile drainage reduction due to cover crop inclusion by approximately 10 for the fall n application treatments fcc vs fn however there was no substantial difference in simulated and observed tile drainage reduction for the treatments with spring n application 3 2 2 impact of cereal rye on soil water balance the soil water balance components precipitation p deep percolation dp tile drainage td evapotranspiration et runoff r and changes in soil water storage s were considered while following tile drainage calibration procedure to check on the simulated plant scale hydrology by the model the simulated values for different hydrological components are presented in table 9 for each crop year from 2014 to 2018 the et as the percentage of p varied from 48 6 to 82 3 in all the years and treatments an increase in et was observed in the soybean years 2015 16 and 2017 18 in the cc treatments as compared to ncc treatments fcc vs fn and scc vs sn however the simulated results showed a decrease in et due to cover crop in the maize years 2014 15 and 2016 17 the et increased by 12 4 during the cover crop period in cc treatments on an average compared to ncc treatments table s2 a considerable impact on the td 21 reduction was observed due to cereal rye inclusion in the winters this effect could be attributed to a diversion of tile drainage water to increase et due to the cereal rye and to the dp table s2 it was noted that there was dp flow in cc treatments whereas there was no dp flow found in ncc treatments this could be due to the soil drainage rate parameter sldr which was adjusted from 0 04 cc treatments to 0 01 in ncc treatments during calibration this might have restricted the drainage water from deep percolation 3 2 3 cereal rye impact on cash crops the overall simulated impact of cereal rye on maize and soybean yields was found to be contrary to experimental findings the observed maize yield decreased by 11 7 on average due to cereal rye inclusion for fall n application fcc vs fn and by 12 6 for spring n application scc vs sn on the contrary the modeled maize yield increased by 4 2 for the fall fcc vs fn n application and 5 3 for the spring scc vs sn n application an analogous discrepancy was identified for the soybean yield when the observed and modeled yields were compared on the field the soybean yield decreased by 2 2 and 5 0 for fcc vs fn and scc vs sn respectively however the simulated yield increased by 4 8 for the fall fcc vs fn n application and by 0 3 for the spring scc vs sn n application these discrepancies in the cash crop yields could be due to higher n mineralization simulated by the model there was no significant variation observed in the impact of cereal rye on maize due to changes in the fertilization timing overall the model failed to replicate the impact of cover crop on maize and soybean yield as observed in the field experiments several studies reported no significant impact or positive impact of cereal rye on the cash crop grown in the long run decade or more basche et al 2016a 2016b kuo and jellum 2000 qi et al 2011 however for a short period up to five years the cereal rye could negatively impact the cash crop growth leuthold et al 2021 roth et al 2018 ruffatti et al 2019 a substantial impact of cereal rye was noted in the nitrogen uptake in soybean due to increased simulated mineralization amid cereal rye inclusion the nitrogen uptake in maize was found to have mixed results decrease in fall dominated n application and increase in spring dominated n application the modeled results showed a increase by 11 1 on average in mineralized n due to the cover crop inclusion an increase in mineralization due to cover cropping was noted to be higher ranging between 11 and 54 in maize years in contrast it ranged from 5 4 in soybean years in the simulated condition the n immobilization increased by 7 9 on average due to the cover cropping moreover the net mineralization mineralization minus immobilization also increased by 14 3 due to planting cereal rye in the maize soybean rotation in simulated condition these model results are in contrast to the observations found under field conditions where a reduction in net mineralization was observed with the presence of cereal rye due to increased n immobilization occurs with a high c n ratio of cereal rye residue basche et al 2016b nevins et al 2020 roth et al 2018 ruffatti et al 2019 the increased n immobilization in the field condition is related to high cereal rye root c n instead of its shoot c n martinez feria et al 2016 also found a similar reasoning for high n immobilization possibility related to cereal rye due to higher c n ratio and higher biomass of its roots compared to that of the shoot this could have impacted the maize n uptake negatively and hence decreased the maize yield in the observed condition the model s weakness in replicating n immobilization could be due to the chemical termination of cereal rye used and the presence of tillage radish in the field in the field experiments the tillage radish was also incorporated along with the cereal rye the radish was winter terminated in december however the cereal rye kept growing until mid april since dssat does not support intercropping feature presently the experiments were modeled using the cereal rye alone since the radish residue is high in n content low c n mixing it with cereal rye high c n reduces c n ratio to the optimum level promoting the mineralization in the field condition ruffatti et al 2019 moreover the chemical application glyphosate used for chemical termination of cereal rye also affects the natural decomposition process and hence could affect the n mineralization immobilization process which was not captured well by the model snapp and borden 2005 observed that glyphosate application 8 days before cover crop termination enhanced the residual decomposition however it also reduced the amount of residue by half approximately compared to untreated cover crop termination the decreased net mineralization observed in the field experiment could also be linked with the reduction in the cereal rye radish residue available for decomposition caused by glyphosate application since the current version of dssat does not support the chemical termination the cereal rye was harvested leaving all its biomass on the field to begin the natural decomposition process therefore the model simulated the increased net mineralization due to untreated termination of cereal rye consequently it led to the failure in replicating the cash crop growth observed in the field particularly for the maize the other possible reasons could be allelopathy increase in maize growth damaging pests or increased pathogens population hosted by cereal rye causing maize seedling disease for causing a detrimental impact on maize yield bakker et al 2016 4 conclusion the modified ceres wheat model in the dssat model did fairly well in replicating the cereal rye growth after carefully fixing temperature related parameters to make the crop thrive on the shorter days and freezing temperatures the soil water and nitrogen results confirmed the reliability of the dssat model in predicting the cereal rye as a winter cover crop inclusion impact on nitrate loss and tile drainage volume due to the absence of the chemical termination feature in the dssat the model could not capture the n mineralization immobilization process that affected its prediction of maize n uptake and maize yield thus the development of the chemical termination routine in the model could enhance the understanding of the cover crop induced impact studies in the field condition the cereal rye and tillage radish seeds were broadcasted into the standing maize soybean crop before harvesting with an overlap of 20 25 days on average however dssat cannot simulate the growth of multiple crops simultaneously which might have affected the results overall the findings revealed that no3 n loss from the field could decrease by 43 6 and 45 4 for fall applied and spring applied n fertilizer treatments respectively moreover cereal rye can potentially reduce the tile drainage volume by approximately 21 even though the model performed poorly in simulating the impact of cereal rye cover crop on the subsequent cash crop yield the insightful findings on soil water n dynamics encourage the use of the model for agricultural policymaking at a large scale and the long term impact assessment

9353,due to increasing concerns regarding plastic pollution throughout the world biodegradable mulch is considered a promising alternative to polyethylene film and its suitability has been verified in some crops however it is unclear whether the long term continuous use of biodegradable mulch as a substitute for polyethylene film is sustainable in rainfed agricultural areas and whether its effect is consistent under different climatic conditions therefore we conducted 7 year 2013 2019 and 4 year 2015 2018 field experiments in two regions with different precipitation levels semiarid and semi humid regions on the loess plateau in china we compared the effects of polyethylene film mulching pm biodegradable film mulching bm and traditional flat planting without film mulching tf on the soil temperature soil moisture grain yield crop water productivity wpc and economic benefit eb the results showed that compared with tf the grain yields under bm and pm increased by 2 1 93 3 and 7 6 34 6 respectively wpc increased by 2 1 93 3 and 7 6 34 6 and eb increased by 16 6 131 5 and 7 8 27 0 the differences in these indexes under the two mulching methods mainly occurred in the dry years with less precipitation in the semiarid region whereas there were no significant differences in the grain yield wpc and eb under bm and pm in the semi humid region therefore the decision regarding whether bm can replace pm to improve maize productivity is significantly affected by the annual precipitation in rainfed areas furthermore the univariate quadratic equation model was used to simulate that bm can obtain a higher crop yield and eb than pm when the precipitation is more than 600 mm and less than 800 mm so as to achieve a win win situation with continuous yield and income increases and environmental friendliness in the loess plateau of china however the yield increase effect of plastic film mulching is also related to crop types mulch types and farming practices except for climate in addition reducing the production cost will still be important for encouraging farmers to use biodegradable film instead of polyethylene film graphical abstract ga1 keywords biodegradable film economic benefit maize productivity precipitation water productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dryland accounts for about 41 of the earth s surface area and about 17 of the global population lives in agricultural areas with extreme water shortages thus dryland agriculture is essential for ensuring food security but scarce precipitation and insufficient water supplies are the main factors that limit agricultural and economic development in rainfed areas fao 2020 in recent years global climate change has increased the frequency and severity of droughts in many regions thereby aggravating the negative impact of drought on food production and human life and further exacerbating agricultural water shortages tietjen et al 2017 therefore developing water harvesting and water saving agriculture is considered an effective method for coping with climate change and achieving the goal of sustainable development in rainfed areas mulching the soil surface with plastic film is an effective method for improving the microclimate and enhancing crop growth and its use has triggered a white revolution by increasing the yield and allowing crops to be cultivated on land with limited water resources and harsh environmental conditions kader et al 2017 plastic film mulching helps to meet the food needs of the growing global population but it also inhibits the growth of weeds and reduces the input of herbicides in the field kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 and thus it has been used widely in rainfed farming due to these advantages by 2030 it is expected that global agriculture will consume 9 5 million tons of plastic to meet the growing food demands of the world s population le moine and ferry 2019 in china alone the consumption of plastic film covering increased nearly fourfold from 1991 to 2011 liu et al 2014 however the disadvantages of plastic film mulching are now obvious due to the increased area covered and its unreasonable use can fail to achieve the optimal effect of film covering thereby wasting resources as well as accelerating plant root senescence and reducing crop yields hu et al 2020 plastic film removal is time consuming and labor intensive and some farmers lack sufficient awareness of environmental hazards so plastic residues are often discarded in farmland to pollute agricultural soil with polyethylene residues briassoulis et al 2013 gao et al 2019 koskei et al 2021 thereby leading to detrimental effects on the environment and human health rodrigues et al 2019 due to the increased global awareness of plastic pollution biodegradable mulch is now considered a promising alternative to polyethylene film brodhagen et al 2017 mari et al 2019 touchaleaume et al 2016 biodegradable mulch can be incorporated into the soil at the end of the season and degraded by soil organisms thereby eliminating the labor and environmental costs associated with the removal and disposal of plastic film currently the most common biodegradable films are additive biodegradable plastic films and fully biodegradable films the former is produced with conventional plastic materials combined with biodegradable materials or additives such as starch and cellulose rosseto et al 2019 the latter is generally consist of substances that can be completely broken down and metabolized by microorganisms and its final metabolites are co2 and h2o without any pollution to the ecological environment sintim et al 2019 these substances briefly include polylactic acid pla polycaprolactone polybutylene succinate polybutylene succinate adipate and polybutylene adipate terephthalate pbat bandopadhyay et al 2018 among them pla and pbat have been selected as new materials for biodegradable film production brodhagen et al 2015 souza et al 2020 due to their ability to achieve a good balance between the quality of the mulch film and its production cost zhao et al 2021 recent studies conducted in various countries throughout the world have shown that biodegradable film has similar effects to polyethylene film on enhancing water retention and the temperature and it can improve the crop yield and economic benefit eb for farmers cowan et al 2014 ramakrishna et al 2006 zhang et al 2020 while have no adverse impact on soil health chen et al 2021 sintim et al 2021 however most of these previous studies involved short term experiments and they did not determine the effect of biodegradable film on the crop productivity and water productivity under long term continuous mulching in addition our previous studies showed that the effects of plastic film mulching on crop productivity may differ due to differences in the precipitation amount and distribution among experimental years huang et al 2021 on the other hand polyethylene film have a very low water vapor transmission rate wvtr 50 g m 2 24 h 1 while biodegradable films have high water permeability wvtr 800 g m 2 24 h 1 based on ester bonds making it difficult to maintain soil moisture in dry areas therefore it is necessary to further investigate the effects of various environmental conditions such as the temperature and precipitation on the water saving benefit of biodegradable film to determine whether it can be used as long term continuous substitute for polyethylene film in a sustainable manner the loess plateau is the largest rainfed agricultural region of china where it has an area of 64 million hectares and a population of 100 million chen et al 2015 in the present study we conducted 7 year and 4 year field experiments in two areas with different precipitation levels semiarid and semi humid areas on the loess plateau we hypothesized that the substitutability of biodegradable films to polyethylene films may be obviously affected by climatic conditions therefore the aims of this study were 1 to compare the differences in the maize grain yield crop water productivity and eb under mulching with polyethylene film and biodegradable film under long term continuous mulching conditions and 2 to determine the suitable environmental conditions temperature and precipitation for replacing polyethylene plastic film with biodegradable film this study provides a theoretical basis for further assessments of whether biodegradable film can be used as an effective substitute for polyethylene film to improve crop productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in two areas of the loess plateau with different precipitation levels fig 1 site 1 was located in a semiarid area in pengyang ningxia province which is in the middle of the loess plateau 35 51 n 106 48 e 1658 m above sea level this area has a typical temperate semiarid continental monsoon climate with average annual precipitation of 430 mm an average annual temperature of 8 1 c and average annual evaporation of 1753 2 mm the soil type is loessal soil sandy clay loam with an average bulk density of 1 36 g cm 3 at the beginning of the experiment 2012 the key nutrient contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer were as follows organic matter 13 78 g kg 1 total nitrogen 1 07 g kg 1 available phosphorus 15 37 mg kg 1 and available potassium 131 40 mg kg 1 site 2 was located in yangling shaanxi semi humid area at the southern boundary of the loess plateau the climate in this area is mild and semi humid with average annual precipitation of 630 mm an average annual temperature of 13 0 c and average annual evaporation of 933 mm the soil type is lou soil eum orthic anthrosol with an average bulk density of 1 40 g cm 3 at the beginning of the experiment 2014 the key nutrient contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer were as follows organic matter 13 81 g kg 1 total nitrogen 1 31 g kg 1 available phosphorus 21 35 mg kg 1 and available potassium 142 97 mg kg 1 site 1 was located in a typical semiarid area and the multi year average annual precipitation 430 mm was much lower than that at site 2 630 mm situated in a semi humid area fig 2a b the precipitation was mainly concentrated in the growth period at site 1 but not at site 2 the interannual precipitation at the two sites varied greatly during the experiment the annual precipitation range at site 1 was 368 3 733 6 mm from 2013 to 2019 the years comprising 2013 2018 and 2019 were relatively humid with annual precipitation exceeding 600 mm in 2016 and 2017 the annual precipitation was less than 400 mm and they were relatively dry years the precipitation in 2014 and 2015 was close to the average annual precipitation and they were normal years the average annual precipitation at site 2 from 2015 to 2018 was 635 9 mm which was close to the average precipitation over 40 years where the lowest annual precipitation occurred in 2016 569 6 mm and the highest in 2018 727 2 mm the temperature also differed between the two experimental sites the annual average temperatures were 8 7 c from 2013 to 2019 at site 1 and 14 2 c from 2015 to 2018 at site 2 fig 2c d in the first month after sowing may the monthly average and minimum temperatures were 14 6 c and 7 9 c at site 1 respectively and 13 7 c and 19 5 c at site 2 during the maize harvest period the average monthly and minimum temperatures at site 1 in september were 15 0 c and 10 4 c respectively and 25 9 c and 21 3 c in august at site 2 2 2 experimental design the experiment had a complete randomized block design and the following three treatments were tested in the field from october each year 1 pm plastic film mulching with transparent polyethylene film wvtr 50 g m 2 24 h 1 where the film width was 120 cm and the thickness was 0 008 mm gansu tianbao plastic plant gansu china after the harvest the plastic film was damaged to varying degrees but it did not degrade 2 bm biodegradable film mulching where the film width was 120 cm and the thickness was 0 008 mm shandong qingtian plastic industry co ltd china the biodegradable film was transparent plastic film wvtr 800 g m 2 24 h 1 mainly comprising pbat 90 pla 5 and other auxiliary agents 5 and the film degraded completely after the harvest 3 tf traditional flat planting without mulching as a control each treatment was repeated three times with a total of nine plots a boundary of 200 cm width was left between different test plots and each plot 14 m long and 4 2 m wide was surrounded by a ridge 60 cm wide to prevent surface runoff and underground lateral infiltration spring maize was sown manually around april 20 each year using an olecranon seeder fertilizer applicator in holes with a depth of approximately 4 5 cm the sowing density in each treatment was 67 000 plants ha 1 60 25 cm the basal fertilizer 140 kg ha 1 n and 150 kg ha 1 p for each treatment was applied at a depth of 4 5 cm with an artificial olecranon seeder when sowing topdressing 140 kg ha 1 n was applied between maize plants 69 75 days after sowing das and no irrigation was provided throughout the whole growth period during the experimental period no diseases and pests occurred in all treatments and artificial weeding was conducted as required after the harvest in the last season all of the old mulching film was removed before applying fresh film mulch again in the autumn 2 3 sample collection and determination method 2 3 1 degradability of fully biodegradable film the degradation process for biodegradable film can be divided into five stages wang et al 2004 the first stage is the induction period when the film begins to exhibit micro cracks 1 cm before 25 of the film has cracks of 2 0 2 5 cm in the second stage followed by clearly visible large cracks of 20 50 cm in the third stage and the film breaks into small fragments in the fourth stage when there are no large areas of complete film on the soil surface the fragments of film disappear from the soil surface in the fifth stage during the maize growing season the degradation of the biodegradable film while exposed in the field was evaluated every 10 das wang et al 2019a in order to retain the autumn rainwater in the soil film mulching was applied after harvesting the crop in the final season and after the autumn rain approximately late october at the two sites thus the biodegradable film began to show signs of degradation at seeding in the following year but the degradation process differed between the two experimental sites table 1 the degradation process was relatively slower for the biodegradable film at site 1 compared with site 2 at site 1 we observed long cracks measuring 2 0 2 5 cm in the biodegradable film at 60 80 das and degradation stage four was reached at 120 140 das before decomposing into small fragments at 160 das after harvesting the maize there were almost no large fragments of film on the soil surface at site 2 degradation stage three was reached at 40 60 das and the fourth stage at 80 100 das after harvesting the maize the biodegradable film was broken into small pieces and some remained on the soil surface the number of fragments was slightly higher at site 2 than site 1 especially in 2016 and 2017 where the number and area of the fragments were higher in addition the data obtained over many years showed that the degradation rate of the biodegradable film varied little at the same site the polyethylene film only contained some cracks caused mainly by mechanical tension and human activities during processing in the later growth stage but no degradation occurred 2 3 2 soil temperature the soil temperature was measured at a depth of 10 cm using an intelligent multi point automatic temperature recorder hebei handan yimeng electronics co ltd where the probe was embedded in the middle of two sowing points i e the position between two maize plants during sowing during the whole growth period the temperature was automatically recorded every 1 h each day from 0 00 23 00 and the average daily soil temperature at a depth of 10 cm was calculated based on all 24 readings 2 3 3 soil moisture a soil sample was collected every 20 cm at a depth of 200 cm to gravimetrically determine the soil water content a soil drill with an inner diameter of 5 cm was used for sampling and the wet weight of the soil sample was measured within 2 h after drying to a constant weight in an oven at 105 c the samples were weighed to determine the mass moisture content of the soil layer the mass water content in each soil layer was then multiplied by soil bulk density multiplied by the soil depth to convert it into the soil water storage sws the sws for the 200 cm soil profile was the sum of those for all the soil layers 2 3 4 aboveground biomass grain yield and crop water productivity wpc at the harvest three rows of undamaged maize were randomly selected from each plot and 10 maize plants were randomly harvested from each row to measure the aboveground biomass and maize grain yield wpc kg ha 1 mm 1 and precipitation water productivity wpp kg ha 1 mm 1 were calculated according to the following formulae fernandez et al 2020 wpc yield etc wpp yield precipitation where yield kg ha 1 is the maize grain yield and etc is the evapotranspiration during the growing season in the two study areas the groundwater level was about 80 m below the soil surface and the experiment was carried out under rain fed conditions with no heavy rains or waterlogging events during the growing season so the infiltration and recharge of groundwater could be ignored due to the flat terrain in the experimental field each piece of land was surrounded by a ridge and there was no runoff and irrigation was not applied throughout the growing season therefore etc mm was calculated according to the following formula mo et al 2016 etc p δsws where p mm is the total precipitation in each growing season and δsws is the difference in sws in the 0 200 cm layer between sowing and harvesting 2 3 5 profitability analysis in this study the main input values usd ha 1 comprised the costs of labor including land preparation field management sowing harvesting and recycling film residue seed plastic film and fertilizer the main outputs comprised the economic outputs in terms of grain and straw the net income from each treatment was the difference between the outputs and inputs 2 3 6 stability of outputs in order to assess the stability of the grain yield wpc and eb under the treatments in different years we calculated the coefficient of variation cv for each of these three parameters for each treatment according to the following formula cv s m 100 where s and m are the standard deviation and mean value for the three parameters during the year 2 4 data analysis analysis of variance was conducted to determine whether the differences between treatments were significant at p 0 05 tukey s honest significant difference test was used to conduct multiple comparisons after significant differences were detected spss 18 0 spss inc chicago il usa was used for statistical analysis and to calculate pearson s correlation coefficients 3 results 3 1 soil hydrothermal environment compared with the tf plots film mulching increased the sws in the 0 2 m soil layer at the time of sowing fig 3a and 3b where the pm and bm treatments increased the average sws by 75 9 mm and 37 7 mm respectively from 2013 to 2019 at site 1 and by 68 0 mm and 32 8 mm from 2015 to 2018 at site 2 at site 1 the difference in the sws before sowing between pm and bm was mainly evident in the relatively dry years such as 2016 and 2017 but the difference between the two gradually became more obvious over time at site 2 in general the sws values in the early growth stage first 80 days at site 1 and first 50 days at site 2 were significantly higher under pm and bm than tf due to the closure of the maize canopy the effect of the increased sws became very small insignificant and even negative in the middle and late growth stages in fact the average sws values under pm and bm decreased by 61 9 mm and 16 9 mm respectively on about 120 das compared with tf and by 26 8 mm and 37 3 mm on about 80 das at site 2 in 2015 2016 in particular in the dry year of 2016 the sws values under pm in the late growth stage from 90 das to the harvest period were 54 9 128 0 mm and 53 0 134 9 mm higher compared with bm and tf respectively at site 1 the average daily soil temperatures were significantly higher in the pm and bm plots than the tf plots fig 4a and 4b in addition the warming effect of mulching on the soil varied among the different growth stages compared with tf pm and bm increased the average soil temperatures in the seedling emergence stage 0 20 das for site 1 and 0 8 das for site 2 by 6 0 c and 3 3 c respectively and by 3 6 c and 1 9 c in the vegetative growth stage 20 110 das for site 1 and 8 80 das for site 2 however the difference decreased due to the growth of the maize and shading of the soil in fact the soil temperatures under bm were only 0 02 c and 0 5 c higher than those in the tf plots during the reproductive stage at site 1 110 160 das and site 2 80 120 das respectively and 1 4 c and 2 0 c higher under pm throughout the whole growing season the average soil temperature increases at site 1 under pm and bm were 2 9 c and 1 0 c respectively and 3 4 c and 2 0 c at site 2 3 2 grain yield aboveground biomass and harvest index film mulching significantly affected the grain yield aboveground biomass and harvest index fig 5 compared with tf the grain yield aboveground biomass and harvest index under pm and bm at site 1 increased by 42 4 and 24 5 36 4 and 22 0 and 7 0 and 5 0 respectively during the cropping years of 2013 2019 the data did not conform to the normal distribution in 2017 where the yield under tf was almost zero due to severe drought and thus it could not be compared and these values were 12 9 and 13 7 14 0 and 12 9 0 8 and 0 9 over the cropping years of 2015 2018 at site 2 in addition the grain yield aboveground biomass and harvest index varied greatly among years in the film mulched plots especially in the bm plots however at site 2 in the semi humid area the grain yield and other indicators exhibited little interannual variation under each treatment and the differences between pm and bm were also smaller than those at site 1 3 3 crop water productivity wpc and precipitation water productivity wpp the effects of film mulching on wpc and wpp are shown in table 2 compared with tf the wpc and wpp were still high under film mulching although film mulching increased the evapotranspiration compared with tf the wpc values under pm and bm at site 1 increased by 4 4 75 8 and 5 7 25 7 respectively over the cropping years of 2013 2019 except in 2017 because of the same reason stated above and by 0 5 11 9 and 5 5 14 8 from 2015 2018 at site 2 the wpp values under pm and bm increased by 42 4 and 24 5 at site 1 respectively and by 12 9 and 13 7 at site 2 in addition the differences in wpc and wpp between pm and bm were mainly detected at site 1 especially in the years with less precipitation from 2014 to 2017 whereas the effects were similar at site 2 3 4 economic benefit eb in this study the total input for the same treatment in all growing seasons at the two sites remained unchanged table 3 in all treatments the costs of seed and fertilizer were 113 0 and 286 0 usd ha 1 respectively compared with tf film covering increased the input costs for the covering materials labor and machine operation in particular the input cost for the biodegradable film material was 325 8 usd ha 1 which was 73 8 higher than that for the polyethylene plastic film but the input cost required for labor to remove debris was reduced so the labor cost for bm was 34 1 lower than that for pm overall the total input costs for pm and bm were 45 7 and 52 1 higher respectively compared with tf despite the increased investment the eb values were significantly higher for the film mulched treatments where the average net incomes under pm and bm were 75 1 773 3 usd ha 1 and 8 1 187 2 usd ha 1 higher respectively in one growing season compared with tf at experimental site 1 and 0 2 5 0 usd ha 1 and 1 9 41 1 usd ha 1 higher at site 2 there were no significant differences in the eb values under pm and bm in the years with more precipitation at site 1 such as 2013 2018 and 2019 in the years with less precipitation such as 2014 2017 eb was significantly higher under pm than bm with an average increase of 91 4 3 5 variability in grain yield crop water productivity wpc and economic benefit eb compared with tf pm significantly decreased the cv values for the grain yield wpc and eb at experimental site 1 p 0 05 but increased the cv values for the grain yield and eb at experimental site 2 p 0 05 fig 6 the cv values for the grain yield and wpc were lower under bm at the two experimental sites than those under tf and the cv for eb was similar to that for tf but the cv values for the grain yield wpc and eb were higher than those under pm at site 1 p 0 05 and similar to those under pm at site 2 3 6 relationships between grain yield wpc eb and climatic conditions our analysis of the effects of temperature and precipitation on maize productivity table 4 showed that the grain yield wpc and eb for film mulched farmland were mainly significantly affected by precipitation further analysis of the relationships between precipitation and the other three variables fig 7 showed that as the precipitation increased the relative grain yield wpc and eb under each treatment increased initially and then decreased the relative grain yield wpc and eb under pm and bm were always higher than those under tf i e 32 9 and 27 1 26 2 and 20 4 and 14 4 and 5 4 higher respectively however the differences between them gradually decreased as the precipitation increased finally the fitted curves for the relative grain yield wpc and eb under pm intersected with those under bm when the precipitation amounts were 604 602 and 602 mm and 821 864 and 802 mm respectively according to the fitted curve equation which is not shown in fig 7 thus when the precipitation was greater than 602 mm and less than 802 mm the maize productivity and eb were higher under bm than pm 4 discussion 4 1 soil hydrothermal environment in this study the biodegradable film degradation process differed at the two experimental sites due to differences in the precipitation and temperature thereby indicating that its degradation characteristics were affected by the climatic conditions moreno and moreno 2008 after mulching during the autumn the biodegradable film began to show signs of degradation when the maize was sown in the following year in the early stage the degradation process was generally slow when the biodegradation process was not activated haider et al 2019 as the maize growth process continued the degradation processes at site 1 and site 2 advanced rapidly after about 60 and 40 das respectively the degradation process in the semi humid area site 2 was slightly faster than that in the semiarid area site 1 possibly due to the higher temperature and greater precipitation in the semi humid area leading to warmer and wetter soil and higher biological activity thereby accelerating the degradation process serrano ruiz et al 2021 and similar findings were reported by zhang et al 2020 the biodegradable film degradation process significantly affected the soil hydrothermal conditions in the early maize growth stage the biodegradable membrane degraded slowly and both pm and bm significantly increased the sws and soil temperature by improving the soil hydrothermal environment for maize germination and early growth mulching effectively alleviates the effects of insufficient rainfall and low temperatures on maize production zhou et al 2009 especially in years and regions with greater hydrothermal restrictions yin et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 however the effects of pm and bm on increasing the soil moisture are weaker in the middle and late stages of the growing season where they mainly depend on the changes in soil evaporation and water consumption for crop growth zhang et al 2019b when the maize canopy completely covers the soil evaporation decreases and the increase in crop transpiration gradually offsets enhancements of the soil moisture due to film mulching wang et al 2016 the difference in the soil temperature under different mulching measures also gradually decreases our analysis of the differences in the effects of bm and pm on the soil moisture and soil temperature showed that the thermal effect of pm lasted until the end of maize growing season and the difference in the soil temperature between bm and tf gradually decreased as the biodegradable film degraded where it was similar to that of bare soil at the end of the cycle however a slightly lower soil temperature during the crop growing stage did not affect the growth and yield weymann et al 2015 and thus temperature was not a limiting factor that affected the improvements in maize productivity under mulching in the present study table 4 additionally the impact of biodegradable film on sws was affected by the amount of precipitation each year where the effect was similar to that of traditional plastic film in wetter years however the effect of bm on soil water conservation decreased with the degradation of the biodegradable film gu et al 2017 and thus the soil moisture stored under bm with high water permeability was not sufficient to offset the effect of drought in the years with limited precipitation overall the effect of biodegradable film on soil water storage was influenced by precipitation year patterns thereby leading to increases in the interannual variability in the grain yield wpc and eb under bm in semiarid areas with low average annual precipitation 4 2 grain yield crop water productivity wpc eb and their relationships with climatic conditions it has been widely reported that bm has a similar effect to pm in improving the crop yield wpc and eb gu et al 2017 wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 similarly the maize productivity and net income obtained under bm were similar to those under pm in the semi humid area with high annual precipitation and the interannual variability in the grain yield and eb were slightly lower compared with those under pm fig 6 however bm significantly increased interannual variability of grain yield wpc and eb compared with pm in semi arid regions with low annual precipitation as the grain yield above ground biomass wpc and eb under bm were far lower than pm in years with limited precipitation at site 1 this suggested that biodegradable film is not always suitable for replacing polyethylene plastic film to improve the maize productivity in rainfed areas because its effectiveness is significantly affected by the annual precipitation table 4 a meta analysis of the crop yield and wpc under biodegradable film by gu et al 2020 reached a similar conclusion where it was shown that the effect of biodegradable film is influenced by environmental conditions such as the altitude temperature and precipitation further analysis of the relationship between precipitation and maize productivity grain yield wpc and eb in plastic mulched farmland fig 7 showed that when the precipitation was less than 600 mm the maize productivity was significantly lower under bm than pm in particular in terms of eb due to the increased material input for mulching the net income under bm in the low precipitation area was almost the same as that under tf and far lower than that under pm however the difference between bm and pm gradually decreased as the precipitation increased when the annual precipitation was more than 600 mm the maize productivity was higher under bm than pm and the difference between them increased initially and then decreased the advantage gradually disappeared after the precipitation reached 800 mm thus the decision regarding whether to replace polyethylene plastic film with biodegradable film is significantly affected by the annual precipitation in rainfed areas with average annual precipitation of 600 800 mm bm can be used instead of pm for mulching farmland to increase the maize productivity and eb as well as reducing the pollution caused by residual film these findings are consistent with most previous studies for example yin et al 2019 and zhang et al 2020 conducted experiments in rain fed areas of northwest china and africa and showed that bm could replace ordinary pm to improve the maize yield and economic income for farmers the average annual precipitation amounts at their experimental sites were about 632 mm and 856 mm respectively and the rainfall had a highly uneven distribution in the semiarid region of africa with average precipitation of only 120 mm in the growing season biodegradable film obtained similar effects to polyethylene film in terms of evaporation limitation yield increases and water saving in addition a study conducted in washington usa average annual precipitation of 736 mm found that biodegradable film had the same effects as polyethylene film on inhibiting weeds and generally increasing the soil temperature to ultimately improve the growth of floricane red raspberry and increase the fruit yield zhang et al 2019a however in xinjiang where the annual precipitation was only 50 250 mm wang et al 2019a b showed that biodegradable film could replace polyethylene plastic film to improve the cotton yield because supplementary irrigation was provided during the growth period to ensure that the average annual water supply the summed precipitation and irrigation reached about 600 mm therefore if supplementary drip irrigation is applied in areas where the average annual rainfall is low when the average annual water supply is at least about 600 mm the choice of biodegradable film instead of polyethylene plastic film can increase the crop yield as well as reducing soil pollution however plastic film mulching effects depend on the environment specific crops and planting methods in locations where direct solar radiation is predominant such as southern europe the impact of mulch is much greater than where diffuse radiation is prevalent such as central europe martín closas et al 2017 when the temperature is not warm enough mulching may promote the development of crops conversely the effect of mulch may be detrimental when applied to the same crops grown at warmer temperatures huang et al 2021 on the other hand the duration of mulching effects varies for different crops in addition the diversity of cultural practices such as soil preparation mulching methods plant density crop season irrigation system etc also contribute to the mulching performance with the corresponding crop effects martín closas et al 2017 which will affect the substitution of biodegradable film for polyethylene film 5 conclusions in the present study we showed that biodegradable film and polyethylene plastic film usually had similar moisture preservation and warming effects in the early maize growth stage the effect of bm on retaining soil moisture gradually decreased as the biodegradable film degraded but the temperature was always higher under transparent polyethylene film than white biodegradable film in years with lower precipitation the water conservation and water saving effects were reduced and not sufficient to offset the impact of drought with increased variation in maize productivity in semiarid areas but decreased variation in semi humid areas therefore bm is not always suitable for replacing pm to improve the crop yield and eb in rainfed areas where the decision regarding replacement is significantly affected by the annual precipitation in rainfed areas with average annual precipitation of 600 800 mm bm could obtain higher maize productivity and eb than pm and help to develop an environmentally friendly farmland ecosystem the results obtained in this study provide an important theoretical reference to facilitate decisions about the long term continuous use of biodegradable film to substitute polyethylene plastic film based on the appropriate climate conditions thereby helping to promote the rational application of biodegradable film however the results of this study were only for autumn mulching with one crop per annum different mulching effects are to take place depending on these interactions between crops environment and cultural practices such as planting irrigation methods additionally the high production cost is still the main limitation that affects the application of bm instead of pm

9353,due to increasing concerns regarding plastic pollution throughout the world biodegradable mulch is considered a promising alternative to polyethylene film and its suitability has been verified in some crops however it is unclear whether the long term continuous use of biodegradable mulch as a substitute for polyethylene film is sustainable in rainfed agricultural areas and whether its effect is consistent under different climatic conditions therefore we conducted 7 year 2013 2019 and 4 year 2015 2018 field experiments in two regions with different precipitation levels semiarid and semi humid regions on the loess plateau in china we compared the effects of polyethylene film mulching pm biodegradable film mulching bm and traditional flat planting without film mulching tf on the soil temperature soil moisture grain yield crop water productivity wpc and economic benefit eb the results showed that compared with tf the grain yields under bm and pm increased by 2 1 93 3 and 7 6 34 6 respectively wpc increased by 2 1 93 3 and 7 6 34 6 and eb increased by 16 6 131 5 and 7 8 27 0 the differences in these indexes under the two mulching methods mainly occurred in the dry years with less precipitation in the semiarid region whereas there were no significant differences in the grain yield wpc and eb under bm and pm in the semi humid region therefore the decision regarding whether bm can replace pm to improve maize productivity is significantly affected by the annual precipitation in rainfed areas furthermore the univariate quadratic equation model was used to simulate that bm can obtain a higher crop yield and eb than pm when the precipitation is more than 600 mm and less than 800 mm so as to achieve a win win situation with continuous yield and income increases and environmental friendliness in the loess plateau of china however the yield increase effect of plastic film mulching is also related to crop types mulch types and farming practices except for climate in addition reducing the production cost will still be important for encouraging farmers to use biodegradable film instead of polyethylene film graphical abstract ga1 keywords biodegradable film economic benefit maize productivity precipitation water productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dryland accounts for about 41 of the earth s surface area and about 17 of the global population lives in agricultural areas with extreme water shortages thus dryland agriculture is essential for ensuring food security but scarce precipitation and insufficient water supplies are the main factors that limit agricultural and economic development in rainfed areas fao 2020 in recent years global climate change has increased the frequency and severity of droughts in many regions thereby aggravating the negative impact of drought on food production and human life and further exacerbating agricultural water shortages tietjen et al 2017 therefore developing water harvesting and water saving agriculture is considered an effective method for coping with climate change and achieving the goal of sustainable development in rainfed areas mulching the soil surface with plastic film is an effective method for improving the microclimate and enhancing crop growth and its use has triggered a white revolution by increasing the yield and allowing crops to be cultivated on land with limited water resources and harsh environmental conditions kader et al 2017 plastic film mulching helps to meet the food needs of the growing global population but it also inhibits the growth of weeds and reduces the input of herbicides in the field kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 and thus it has been used widely in rainfed farming due to these advantages by 2030 it is expected that global agriculture will consume 9 5 million tons of plastic to meet the growing food demands of the world s population le moine and ferry 2019 in china alone the consumption of plastic film covering increased nearly fourfold from 1991 to 2011 liu et al 2014 however the disadvantages of plastic film mulching are now obvious due to the increased area covered and its unreasonable use can fail to achieve the optimal effect of film covering thereby wasting resources as well as accelerating plant root senescence and reducing crop yields hu et al 2020 plastic film removal is time consuming and labor intensive and some farmers lack sufficient awareness of environmental hazards so plastic residues are often discarded in farmland to pollute agricultural soil with polyethylene residues briassoulis et al 2013 gao et al 2019 koskei et al 2021 thereby leading to detrimental effects on the environment and human health rodrigues et al 2019 due to the increased global awareness of plastic pollution biodegradable mulch is now considered a promising alternative to polyethylene film brodhagen et al 2017 mari et al 2019 touchaleaume et al 2016 biodegradable mulch can be incorporated into the soil at the end of the season and degraded by soil organisms thereby eliminating the labor and environmental costs associated with the removal and disposal of plastic film currently the most common biodegradable films are additive biodegradable plastic films and fully biodegradable films the former is produced with conventional plastic materials combined with biodegradable materials or additives such as starch and cellulose rosseto et al 2019 the latter is generally consist of substances that can be completely broken down and metabolized by microorganisms and its final metabolites are co2 and h2o without any pollution to the ecological environment sintim et al 2019 these substances briefly include polylactic acid pla polycaprolactone polybutylene succinate polybutylene succinate adipate and polybutylene adipate terephthalate pbat bandopadhyay et al 2018 among them pla and pbat have been selected as new materials for biodegradable film production brodhagen et al 2015 souza et al 2020 due to their ability to achieve a good balance between the quality of the mulch film and its production cost zhao et al 2021 recent studies conducted in various countries throughout the world have shown that biodegradable film has similar effects to polyethylene film on enhancing water retention and the temperature and it can improve the crop yield and economic benefit eb for farmers cowan et al 2014 ramakrishna et al 2006 zhang et al 2020 while have no adverse impact on soil health chen et al 2021 sintim et al 2021 however most of these previous studies involved short term experiments and they did not determine the effect of biodegradable film on the crop productivity and water productivity under long term continuous mulching in addition our previous studies showed that the effects of plastic film mulching on crop productivity may differ due to differences in the precipitation amount and distribution among experimental years huang et al 2021 on the other hand polyethylene film have a very low water vapor transmission rate wvtr 50 g m 2 24 h 1 while biodegradable films have high water permeability wvtr 800 g m 2 24 h 1 based on ester bonds making it difficult to maintain soil moisture in dry areas therefore it is necessary to further investigate the effects of various environmental conditions such as the temperature and precipitation on the water saving benefit of biodegradable film to determine whether it can be used as long term continuous substitute for polyethylene film in a sustainable manner the loess plateau is the largest rainfed agricultural region of china where it has an area of 64 million hectares and a population of 100 million chen et al 2015 in the present study we conducted 7 year and 4 year field experiments in two areas with different precipitation levels semiarid and semi humid areas on the loess plateau we hypothesized that the substitutability of biodegradable films to polyethylene films may be obviously affected by climatic conditions therefore the aims of this study were 1 to compare the differences in the maize grain yield crop water productivity and eb under mulching with polyethylene film and biodegradable film under long term continuous mulching conditions and 2 to determine the suitable environmental conditions temperature and precipitation for replacing polyethylene plastic film with biodegradable film this study provides a theoretical basis for further assessments of whether biodegradable film can be used as an effective substitute for polyethylene film to improve crop productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in two areas of the loess plateau with different precipitation levels fig 1 site 1 was located in a semiarid area in pengyang ningxia province which is in the middle of the loess plateau 35 51 n 106 48 e 1658 m above sea level this area has a typical temperate semiarid continental monsoon climate with average annual precipitation of 430 mm an average annual temperature of 8 1 c and average annual evaporation of 1753 2 mm the soil type is loessal soil sandy clay loam with an average bulk density of 1 36 g cm 3 at the beginning of the experiment 2012 the key nutrient contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer were as follows organic matter 13 78 g kg 1 total nitrogen 1 07 g kg 1 available phosphorus 15 37 mg kg 1 and available potassium 131 40 mg kg 1 site 2 was located in yangling shaanxi semi humid area at the southern boundary of the loess plateau the climate in this area is mild and semi humid with average annual precipitation of 630 mm an average annual temperature of 13 0 c and average annual evaporation of 933 mm the soil type is lou soil eum orthic anthrosol with an average bulk density of 1 40 g cm 3 at the beginning of the experiment 2014 the key nutrient contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer were as follows organic matter 13 81 g kg 1 total nitrogen 1 31 g kg 1 available phosphorus 21 35 mg kg 1 and available potassium 142 97 mg kg 1 site 1 was located in a typical semiarid area and the multi year average annual precipitation 430 mm was much lower than that at site 2 630 mm situated in a semi humid area fig 2a b the precipitation was mainly concentrated in the growth period at site 1 but not at site 2 the interannual precipitation at the two sites varied greatly during the experiment the annual precipitation range at site 1 was 368 3 733 6 mm from 2013 to 2019 the years comprising 2013 2018 and 2019 were relatively humid with annual precipitation exceeding 600 mm in 2016 and 2017 the annual precipitation was less than 400 mm and they were relatively dry years the precipitation in 2014 and 2015 was close to the average annual precipitation and they were normal years the average annual precipitation at site 2 from 2015 to 2018 was 635 9 mm which was close to the average precipitation over 40 years where the lowest annual precipitation occurred in 2016 569 6 mm and the highest in 2018 727 2 mm the temperature also differed between the two experimental sites the annual average temperatures were 8 7 c from 2013 to 2019 at site 1 and 14 2 c from 2015 to 2018 at site 2 fig 2c d in the first month after sowing may the monthly average and minimum temperatures were 14 6 c and 7 9 c at site 1 respectively and 13 7 c and 19 5 c at site 2 during the maize harvest period the average monthly and minimum temperatures at site 1 in september were 15 0 c and 10 4 c respectively and 25 9 c and 21 3 c in august at site 2 2 2 experimental design the experiment had a complete randomized block design and the following three treatments were tested in the field from october each year 1 pm plastic film mulching with transparent polyethylene film wvtr 50 g m 2 24 h 1 where the film width was 120 cm and the thickness was 0 008 mm gansu tianbao plastic plant gansu china after the harvest the plastic film was damaged to varying degrees but it did not degrade 2 bm biodegradable film mulching where the film width was 120 cm and the thickness was 0 008 mm shandong qingtian plastic industry co ltd china the biodegradable film was transparent plastic film wvtr 800 g m 2 24 h 1 mainly comprising pbat 90 pla 5 and other auxiliary agents 5 and the film degraded completely after the harvest 3 tf traditional flat planting without mulching as a control each treatment was repeated three times with a total of nine plots a boundary of 200 cm width was left between different test plots and each plot 14 m long and 4 2 m wide was surrounded by a ridge 60 cm wide to prevent surface runoff and underground lateral infiltration spring maize was sown manually around april 20 each year using an olecranon seeder fertilizer applicator in holes with a depth of approximately 4 5 cm the sowing density in each treatment was 67 000 plants ha 1 60 25 cm the basal fertilizer 140 kg ha 1 n and 150 kg ha 1 p for each treatment was applied at a depth of 4 5 cm with an artificial olecranon seeder when sowing topdressing 140 kg ha 1 n was applied between maize plants 69 75 days after sowing das and no irrigation was provided throughout the whole growth period during the experimental period no diseases and pests occurred in all treatments and artificial weeding was conducted as required after the harvest in the last season all of the old mulching film was removed before applying fresh film mulch again in the autumn 2 3 sample collection and determination method 2 3 1 degradability of fully biodegradable film the degradation process for biodegradable film can be divided into five stages wang et al 2004 the first stage is the induction period when the film begins to exhibit micro cracks 1 cm before 25 of the film has cracks of 2 0 2 5 cm in the second stage followed by clearly visible large cracks of 20 50 cm in the third stage and the film breaks into small fragments in the fourth stage when there are no large areas of complete film on the soil surface the fragments of film disappear from the soil surface in the fifth stage during the maize growing season the degradation of the biodegradable film while exposed in the field was evaluated every 10 das wang et al 2019a in order to retain the autumn rainwater in the soil film mulching was applied after harvesting the crop in the final season and after the autumn rain approximately late october at the two sites thus the biodegradable film began to show signs of degradation at seeding in the following year but the degradation process differed between the two experimental sites table 1 the degradation process was relatively slower for the biodegradable film at site 1 compared with site 2 at site 1 we observed long cracks measuring 2 0 2 5 cm in the biodegradable film at 60 80 das and degradation stage four was reached at 120 140 das before decomposing into small fragments at 160 das after harvesting the maize there were almost no large fragments of film on the soil surface at site 2 degradation stage three was reached at 40 60 das and the fourth stage at 80 100 das after harvesting the maize the biodegradable film was broken into small pieces and some remained on the soil surface the number of fragments was slightly higher at site 2 than site 1 especially in 2016 and 2017 where the number and area of the fragments were higher in addition the data obtained over many years showed that the degradation rate of the biodegradable film varied little at the same site the polyethylene film only contained some cracks caused mainly by mechanical tension and human activities during processing in the later growth stage but no degradation occurred 2 3 2 soil temperature the soil temperature was measured at a depth of 10 cm using an intelligent multi point automatic temperature recorder hebei handan yimeng electronics co ltd where the probe was embedded in the middle of two sowing points i e the position between two maize plants during sowing during the whole growth period the temperature was automatically recorded every 1 h each day from 0 00 23 00 and the average daily soil temperature at a depth of 10 cm was calculated based on all 24 readings 2 3 3 soil moisture a soil sample was collected every 20 cm at a depth of 200 cm to gravimetrically determine the soil water content a soil drill with an inner diameter of 5 cm was used for sampling and the wet weight of the soil sample was measured within 2 h after drying to a constant weight in an oven at 105 c the samples were weighed to determine the mass moisture content of the soil layer the mass water content in each soil layer was then multiplied by soil bulk density multiplied by the soil depth to convert it into the soil water storage sws the sws for the 200 cm soil profile was the sum of those for all the soil layers 2 3 4 aboveground biomass grain yield and crop water productivity wpc at the harvest three rows of undamaged maize were randomly selected from each plot and 10 maize plants were randomly harvested from each row to measure the aboveground biomass and maize grain yield wpc kg ha 1 mm 1 and precipitation water productivity wpp kg ha 1 mm 1 were calculated according to the following formulae fernandez et al 2020 wpc yield etc wpp yield precipitation where yield kg ha 1 is the maize grain yield and etc is the evapotranspiration during the growing season in the two study areas the groundwater level was about 80 m below the soil surface and the experiment was carried out under rain fed conditions with no heavy rains or waterlogging events during the growing season so the infiltration and recharge of groundwater could be ignored due to the flat terrain in the experimental field each piece of land was surrounded by a ridge and there was no runoff and irrigation was not applied throughout the growing season therefore etc mm was calculated according to the following formula mo et al 2016 etc p δsws where p mm is the total precipitation in each growing season and δsws is the difference in sws in the 0 200 cm layer between sowing and harvesting 2 3 5 profitability analysis in this study the main input values usd ha 1 comprised the costs of labor including land preparation field management sowing harvesting and recycling film residue seed plastic film and fertilizer the main outputs comprised the economic outputs in terms of grain and straw the net income from each treatment was the difference between the outputs and inputs 2 3 6 stability of outputs in order to assess the stability of the grain yield wpc and eb under the treatments in different years we calculated the coefficient of variation cv for each of these three parameters for each treatment according to the following formula cv s m 100 where s and m are the standard deviation and mean value for the three parameters during the year 2 4 data analysis analysis of variance was conducted to determine whether the differences between treatments were significant at p 0 05 tukey s honest significant difference test was used to conduct multiple comparisons after significant differences were detected spss 18 0 spss inc chicago il usa was used for statistical analysis and to calculate pearson s correlation coefficients 3 results 3 1 soil hydrothermal environment compared with the tf plots film mulching increased the sws in the 0 2 m soil layer at the time of sowing fig 3a and 3b where the pm and bm treatments increased the average sws by 75 9 mm and 37 7 mm respectively from 2013 to 2019 at site 1 and by 68 0 mm and 32 8 mm from 2015 to 2018 at site 2 at site 1 the difference in the sws before sowing between pm and bm was mainly evident in the relatively dry years such as 2016 and 2017 but the difference between the two gradually became more obvious over time at site 2 in general the sws values in the early growth stage first 80 days at site 1 and first 50 days at site 2 were significantly higher under pm and bm than tf due to the closure of the maize canopy the effect of the increased sws became very small insignificant and even negative in the middle and late growth stages in fact the average sws values under pm and bm decreased by 61 9 mm and 16 9 mm respectively on about 120 das compared with tf and by 26 8 mm and 37 3 mm on about 80 das at site 2 in 2015 2016 in particular in the dry year of 2016 the sws values under pm in the late growth stage from 90 das to the harvest period were 54 9 128 0 mm and 53 0 134 9 mm higher compared with bm and tf respectively at site 1 the average daily soil temperatures were significantly higher in the pm and bm plots than the tf plots fig 4a and 4b in addition the warming effect of mulching on the soil varied among the different growth stages compared with tf pm and bm increased the average soil temperatures in the seedling emergence stage 0 20 das for site 1 and 0 8 das for site 2 by 6 0 c and 3 3 c respectively and by 3 6 c and 1 9 c in the vegetative growth stage 20 110 das for site 1 and 8 80 das for site 2 however the difference decreased due to the growth of the maize and shading of the soil in fact the soil temperatures under bm were only 0 02 c and 0 5 c higher than those in the tf plots during the reproductive stage at site 1 110 160 das and site 2 80 120 das respectively and 1 4 c and 2 0 c higher under pm throughout the whole growing season the average soil temperature increases at site 1 under pm and bm were 2 9 c and 1 0 c respectively and 3 4 c and 2 0 c at site 2 3 2 grain yield aboveground biomass and harvest index film mulching significantly affected the grain yield aboveground biomass and harvest index fig 5 compared with tf the grain yield aboveground biomass and harvest index under pm and bm at site 1 increased by 42 4 and 24 5 36 4 and 22 0 and 7 0 and 5 0 respectively during the cropping years of 2013 2019 the data did not conform to the normal distribution in 2017 where the yield under tf was almost zero due to severe drought and thus it could not be compared and these values were 12 9 and 13 7 14 0 and 12 9 0 8 and 0 9 over the cropping years of 2015 2018 at site 2 in addition the grain yield aboveground biomass and harvest index varied greatly among years in the film mulched plots especially in the bm plots however at site 2 in the semi humid area the grain yield and other indicators exhibited little interannual variation under each treatment and the differences between pm and bm were also smaller than those at site 1 3 3 crop water productivity wpc and precipitation water productivity wpp the effects of film mulching on wpc and wpp are shown in table 2 compared with tf the wpc and wpp were still high under film mulching although film mulching increased the evapotranspiration compared with tf the wpc values under pm and bm at site 1 increased by 4 4 75 8 and 5 7 25 7 respectively over the cropping years of 2013 2019 except in 2017 because of the same reason stated above and by 0 5 11 9 and 5 5 14 8 from 2015 2018 at site 2 the wpp values under pm and bm increased by 42 4 and 24 5 at site 1 respectively and by 12 9 and 13 7 at site 2 in addition the differences in wpc and wpp between pm and bm were mainly detected at site 1 especially in the years with less precipitation from 2014 to 2017 whereas the effects were similar at site 2 3 4 economic benefit eb in this study the total input for the same treatment in all growing seasons at the two sites remained unchanged table 3 in all treatments the costs of seed and fertilizer were 113 0 and 286 0 usd ha 1 respectively compared with tf film covering increased the input costs for the covering materials labor and machine operation in particular the input cost for the biodegradable film material was 325 8 usd ha 1 which was 73 8 higher than that for the polyethylene plastic film but the input cost required for labor to remove debris was reduced so the labor cost for bm was 34 1 lower than that for pm overall the total input costs for pm and bm were 45 7 and 52 1 higher respectively compared with tf despite the increased investment the eb values were significantly higher for the film mulched treatments where the average net incomes under pm and bm were 75 1 773 3 usd ha 1 and 8 1 187 2 usd ha 1 higher respectively in one growing season compared with tf at experimental site 1 and 0 2 5 0 usd ha 1 and 1 9 41 1 usd ha 1 higher at site 2 there were no significant differences in the eb values under pm and bm in the years with more precipitation at site 1 such as 2013 2018 and 2019 in the years with less precipitation such as 2014 2017 eb was significantly higher under pm than bm with an average increase of 91 4 3 5 variability in grain yield crop water productivity wpc and economic benefit eb compared with tf pm significantly decreased the cv values for the grain yield wpc and eb at experimental site 1 p 0 05 but increased the cv values for the grain yield and eb at experimental site 2 p 0 05 fig 6 the cv values for the grain yield and wpc were lower under bm at the two experimental sites than those under tf and the cv for eb was similar to that for tf but the cv values for the grain yield wpc and eb were higher than those under pm at site 1 p 0 05 and similar to those under pm at site 2 3 6 relationships between grain yield wpc eb and climatic conditions our analysis of the effects of temperature and precipitation on maize productivity table 4 showed that the grain yield wpc and eb for film mulched farmland were mainly significantly affected by precipitation further analysis of the relationships between precipitation and the other three variables fig 7 showed that as the precipitation increased the relative grain yield wpc and eb under each treatment increased initially and then decreased the relative grain yield wpc and eb under pm and bm were always higher than those under tf i e 32 9 and 27 1 26 2 and 20 4 and 14 4 and 5 4 higher respectively however the differences between them gradually decreased as the precipitation increased finally the fitted curves for the relative grain yield wpc and eb under pm intersected with those under bm when the precipitation amounts were 604 602 and 602 mm and 821 864 and 802 mm respectively according to the fitted curve equation which is not shown in fig 7 thus when the precipitation was greater than 602 mm and less than 802 mm the maize productivity and eb were higher under bm than pm 4 discussion 4 1 soil hydrothermal environment in this study the biodegradable film degradation process differed at the two experimental sites due to differences in the precipitation and temperature thereby indicating that its degradation characteristics were affected by the climatic conditions moreno and moreno 2008 after mulching during the autumn the biodegradable film began to show signs of degradation when the maize was sown in the following year in the early stage the degradation process was generally slow when the biodegradation process was not activated haider et al 2019 as the maize growth process continued the degradation processes at site 1 and site 2 advanced rapidly after about 60 and 40 das respectively the degradation process in the semi humid area site 2 was slightly faster than that in the semiarid area site 1 possibly due to the higher temperature and greater precipitation in the semi humid area leading to warmer and wetter soil and higher biological activity thereby accelerating the degradation process serrano ruiz et al 2021 and similar findings were reported by zhang et al 2020 the biodegradable film degradation process significantly affected the soil hydrothermal conditions in the early maize growth stage the biodegradable membrane degraded slowly and both pm and bm significantly increased the sws and soil temperature by improving the soil hydrothermal environment for maize germination and early growth mulching effectively alleviates the effects of insufficient rainfall and low temperatures on maize production zhou et al 2009 especially in years and regions with greater hydrothermal restrictions yin et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 however the effects of pm and bm on increasing the soil moisture are weaker in the middle and late stages of the growing season where they mainly depend on the changes in soil evaporation and water consumption for crop growth zhang et al 2019b when the maize canopy completely covers the soil evaporation decreases and the increase in crop transpiration gradually offsets enhancements of the soil moisture due to film mulching wang et al 2016 the difference in the soil temperature under different mulching measures also gradually decreases our analysis of the differences in the effects of bm and pm on the soil moisture and soil temperature showed that the thermal effect of pm lasted until the end of maize growing season and the difference in the soil temperature between bm and tf gradually decreased as the biodegradable film degraded where it was similar to that of bare soil at the end of the cycle however a slightly lower soil temperature during the crop growing stage did not affect the growth and yield weymann et al 2015 and thus temperature was not a limiting factor that affected the improvements in maize productivity under mulching in the present study table 4 additionally the impact of biodegradable film on sws was affected by the amount of precipitation each year where the effect was similar to that of traditional plastic film in wetter years however the effect of bm on soil water conservation decreased with the degradation of the biodegradable film gu et al 2017 and thus the soil moisture stored under bm with high water permeability was not sufficient to offset the effect of drought in the years with limited precipitation overall the effect of biodegradable film on soil water storage was influenced by precipitation year patterns thereby leading to increases in the interannual variability in the grain yield wpc and eb under bm in semiarid areas with low average annual precipitation 4 2 grain yield crop water productivity wpc eb and their relationships with climatic conditions it has been widely reported that bm has a similar effect to pm in improving the crop yield wpc and eb gu et al 2017 wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 similarly the maize productivity and net income obtained under bm were similar to those under pm in the semi humid area with high annual precipitation and the interannual variability in the grain yield and eb were slightly lower compared with those under pm fig 6 however bm significantly increased interannual variability of grain yield wpc and eb compared with pm in semi arid regions with low annual precipitation as the grain yield above ground biomass wpc and eb under bm were far lower than pm in years with limited precipitation at site 1 this suggested that biodegradable film is not always suitable for replacing polyethylene plastic film to improve the maize productivity in rainfed areas because its effectiveness is significantly affected by the annual precipitation table 4 a meta analysis of the crop yield and wpc under biodegradable film by gu et al 2020 reached a similar conclusion where it was shown that the effect of biodegradable film is influenced by environmental conditions such as the altitude temperature and precipitation further analysis of the relationship between precipitation and maize productivity grain yield wpc and eb in plastic mulched farmland fig 7 showed that when the precipitation was less than 600 mm the maize productivity was significantly lower under bm than pm in particular in terms of eb due to the increased material input for mulching the net income under bm in the low precipitation area was almost the same as that under tf and far lower than that under pm however the difference between bm and pm gradually decreased as the precipitation increased when the annual precipitation was more than 600 mm the maize productivity was higher under bm than pm and the difference between them increased initially and then decreased the advantage gradually disappeared after the precipitation reached 800 mm thus the decision regarding whether to replace polyethylene plastic film with biodegradable film is significantly affected by the annual precipitation in rainfed areas with average annual precipitation of 600 800 mm bm can be used instead of pm for mulching farmland to increase the maize productivity and eb as well as reducing the pollution caused by residual film these findings are consistent with most previous studies for example yin et al 2019 and zhang et al 2020 conducted experiments in rain fed areas of northwest china and africa and showed that bm could replace ordinary pm to improve the maize yield and economic income for farmers the average annual precipitation amounts at their experimental sites were about 632 mm and 856 mm respectively and the rainfall had a highly uneven distribution in the semiarid region of africa with average precipitation of only 120 mm in the growing season biodegradable film obtained similar effects to polyethylene film in terms of evaporation limitation yield increases and water saving in addition a study conducted in washington usa average annual precipitation of 736 mm found that biodegradable film had the same effects as polyethylene film on inhibiting weeds and generally increasing the soil temperature to ultimately improve the growth of floricane red raspberry and increase the fruit yield zhang et al 2019a however in xinjiang where the annual precipitation was only 50 250 mm wang et al 2019a b showed that biodegradable film could replace polyethylene plastic film to improve the cotton yield because supplementary irrigation was provided during the growth period to ensure that the average annual water supply the summed precipitation and irrigation reached about 600 mm therefore if supplementary drip irrigation is applied in areas where the average annual rainfall is low when the average annual water supply is at least about 600 mm the choice of biodegradable film instead of polyethylene plastic film can increase the crop yield as well as reducing soil pollution however plastic film mulching effects depend on the environment specific crops and planting methods in locations where direct solar radiation is predominant such as southern europe the impact of mulch is much greater than where diffuse radiation is prevalent such as central europe martín closas et al 2017 when the temperature is not warm enough mulching may promote the development of crops conversely the effect of mulch may be detrimental when applied to the same crops grown at warmer temperatures huang et al 2021 on the other hand the duration of mulching effects varies for different crops in addition the diversity of cultural practices such as soil preparation mulching methods plant density crop season irrigation system etc also contribute to the mulching performance with the corresponding crop effects martín closas et al 2017 which will affect the substitution of biodegradable film for polyethylene film 5 conclusions in the present study we showed that biodegradable film and polyethylene plastic film usually had similar moisture preservation and warming effects in the early maize growth stage the effect of bm on retaining soil moisture gradually decreased as the biodegradable film degraded but the temperature was always higher under transparent polyethylene film than white biodegradable film in years with lower precipitation the water conservation and water saving effects were reduced and not sufficient to offset the impact of drought with increased variation in maize productivity in semiarid areas but decreased variation in semi humid areas therefore bm is not always suitable for replacing pm to improve the crop yield and eb in rainfed areas where the decision regarding replacement is significantly affected by the annual precipitation in rainfed areas with average annual precipitation of 600 800 mm bm could obtain higher maize productivity and eb than pm and help to develop an environmentally friendly farmland ecosystem the results obtained in this study provide an important theoretical reference to facilitate decisions about the long term continuous use of biodegradable film to substitute polyethylene plastic film based on the appropriate climate conditions thereby helping to promote the rational application of biodegradable film however the results of this study were only for autumn mulching with one crop per annum different mulching effects are to take place depending on these interactions between crops environment and cultural practices such as planting irrigation methods additionally the high production cost is still the main limitation that affects the application of bm instead of pm

9354,ecosystem based approaches including soil inoculation have been considered to improve the soil water behavior for the purpose of ensuring better irrigation management on farms this study was therefore conducted to assess the responses of the moisture characteristic curve mcc and saturated hydraulic conductivity shc to soil inoculation with cyanobacteria to this end the most suitable existing cyanobacteria i e nostoc sp and oscillatoria sp from the original soil were inoculated on clay loam and sand textures at a small cylinder scale after 35 days the mcc and shc of the treatments six control and inoculation treatments in three repetitions were measured using the sandbox and pressure plate and constant head method respectively the results showed that in the control treatment the volumetric water content of the clay loam and sand textures was 38 69 28 58 and 8 24 respectively meanwhile the inoculation of cyanobacteria led to a significant p 0 05 increase in the mcc of the loam and sand soils their values were 36 65 and 16 31 respectively in the control the shc of the clay loam and sand textures was 0 42 0 54 and 1 21 cm min 1 respectively meanwhile this was 0 37 0 50 and 0 67 cm min 1 for the inoculated treatments respectively on the other hand the inoculated cyanobacteria reduced the shc of the sand soils by 44 we also found that the inoculated cyanobacteria perceptibly improved the soil surface physical and chemical properties which could play a key role in determining the soil hydraulic and hydrologic behavior overall we found that soil inoculation with cyanobacteria could be an effective approach in improving the soil water behavior especially in coarse texture soils thus it could serve as a suitable irrigation and drainage management method in agricultural lands keywords bioengineering irrigation management soil inoculation soil water behavior water retention data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the united nations un has recently drawn up the sustainable development goals sdgs in three domains economic social and environmental all to address worldwide challenges such as water crisis and food security by 2030 randers et al 2018 despite this global focus achieving a sustainable economy and society will not be possible unless there is success in the environmental domain visser et al 2019 among the environment domain layers soil water movement transfer management in agricultural lands can help to achieve water use efficiency and sustainable food production as identified in the un sdgs keesstra et al 2018 the processes of soil water movement depend on the hydraulic and hydrological characteristics of the soil especially the soil moisture characteristic curve mcc and saturated hydraulic conductivity shc lo et al 2017 soil surface characteristics especially soil texture can affect both mcc and shc wang et al 2017 in the case of unfavorable soil textures for agriculture disruption of water and solute transport from the soil surface to the subsoil can make it impossible to optimally manage irrigation in agricultural lands rezaei et al 2017 fine grained soils as clay texture soils pose various challenges in agricultural lands such as poor air ventilation ponding water plant suffocation high irrigation runoff low infiltration rate low porosity and pollutants accumulation de andrade bonetti et al 2017 there are also challenges in regard to coarse grained soils as in the sand texture ones e g nutrients leaching low water holding capacity poverty of organic matter and high frequency of irrigation de andrade bonetti et al 2017 accordingly the shc mcc low high values in the fine and coarse textured soils are the main limitations affecting the irrigation programs it seems therefore that the improvement of such soils can be taken a step forward to achieve sustainable agriculture along with the efficient use of water rahmati et al 2018 therefore there is a global interest in implementing some effective measures to manage the shc and mcc behavior in the fine and coarse textured soils to this end various ways have been used to improve and modify the texture and other characteristics of the soil surface that control shc and mcc such as amelioration of soil properties sadeghi et al 2018 for this a wide range of natural and artificial amendments have been proposed viz sawdust and wood ash biochars municipal wastes gypsum and lime sadeghi et al 2018 composts manures agricultural and food industries residues urra et al 2019 and biodegradable polymers moreira et al 2018 however despite the good results reported following such amendments some problems have limited their widespread use these are related to economy environment applicability accessibility and instability rumpel et al 2015 alam 2018 therefore it seems necessary to develop methods not subject to these restrictions as well they have been classified as eco friendly and technically proficient strategies sadeghi et al 2020a the soil inoculation especially with cyanobacteria is one of the approaches considered today kheirfam et al 2017a and b mugnai et al 2018 chamizo et al 2018 kheirfam et al 2020 kheirfam and roohi 2020 cyanobacteria are photo autotrophic micro organisms known as the key and pioneer living organisms in the soil crusts especially in drylands garcia pichel and wojciechowski 2009 cyanobacteria can also provide the nutrient sources for other living heterotrophic micro and macro organisms on the top soil lan et al 2015 by nitrogen fixation and carbon sequestration in soil kheirfam et al 2017a kheirfam 2020 as well as secretion of nutritious exopolysaccharides epss roncero ramos et al 2019 furthermore the substances produced by cyanobacteria especially epss have a sticky nature building soil aggregates through binding soil fine particles to each other colica et al 2014 in addition to epss the cyanobacterial filamentary structure can create soil micro networks by connecting soil aggregates together kheirfam and asadzadeh 2020 indeed the creation of stable and larger size soils leads to amending the soil surface porosity sadeghi et al 2020a aggregation crouzet et al 2019 and water retention capacity adessi et al 2018 thereby providing some soil environmental conditions suitable for improving the soil shc and mcc in the soil crusts with inherent cyanobacterial poverty even in the presence of other micro organisms the role of cyanobacteria in improving the soil properties may be imperceptible kheirfam and roohi 2020 or this may happen in a long term period belnap et al 2014 therefore soil inoculation with a high density of cyanobacteria inoculum especially the native species could be a fast strategy to improve the top soil characteristics kheirfam et al 2020 sadeghi et al 2020b this may affect the soil shc and mcc behavior the available literature shows that different soil textures in agricultural lands can significantly affect the behavior of the soil shc and mcc subsequently creating complexities in the optimal irrigation management as well as crop production rahmati et al 2018 the slow discharge of drainable water low shc in fine grained clay and loam and low water holding capacity and high shc in coarse grained sand soils are known as the main challenges in irrigating farms through the high efficiency management rahmati et al 2018 on the other hand the artificial increase of soil cyanobacteria population density using inoculation based techniques has been successfully implemented to improve the soil functionality kheirfam et al 2017a chamizo et al 2018 muñoz rojas et al 2018 kheirfam 2020 to reduce soil erosion and runoff yield kheirfam et al 2017b and 2020 sadeghi et al 2017 and 2020a and b to control wind induced sand flowing kheirfam and asadzadeh 2020 to promote the formation of biological soil crusts in bare sandy substrates mugnai et al 2018 and to restore the degraded lands kheirfam and roohi 2020 accordingly we hypothesized that the soil inoculation with the native cyanobacteria biomass in the top soil of various textures i e clay loam and sand could be regarded as an effective time saving strategy to improve the soil shc and mcc as the main variables affecting the agricultural water management hence the cyanobacterial inoculation technique can be introduced as an innovative idea for the irrigation and drainage management in agricultural lands this has previously received less attention to address this knowledge gap it is necessary to assess how the soil hydraulic properties vary with cyanobacterial inoculation in various textures therefore the main objective of this study are to investigate the effect of the cyanobacterial inoculation on the soil shc and mcc behavior in three different soil textures under laboratory conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil collection site and sampling the studied soil was collected from the research farm of urmia university west azerbaijan province nw iran at 44 58 to 44 59 5 e longitudes and 37 38 5 to 37 40 n latitudes the mean annual precipitation is about 327 mm with a mean annual potential evapotranspiration of 1504 mm and the mean annual temperature of 9 8 c representing cold temperate and semi arid zones the study site soil texture the original soil at site was classified as a clay loam one with the sand silt and clay content of 30 36 and 34 respectively the organic matter and nitrogen of the study soil were 5 51 and 1 39 g kg 1 respectively the origin soil bulk density electrical conductivity and ph were also 1 35 g cm 3 0 45 ds m 1 and 8 4 respectively to prepare the inoculum we collected 10 soil samples from the upper 5 cm layer of the research site using corings of polyvinyl chloride to isolate the native cyanobacteria kheirfam et al 2017a the collected samples were air dried immediately mixed thoroughly and sieved to 4 mm to use them for the isolation stage as described in the next section we tried to keep all affecting factors similar in both inoculated and control treatments in order to assess just the role of inoculation of cyanobacteria on soil hydraulic properties accordingly we collected other bulk samples from the study site 0 10 cm depth then they were homogenized and air dried to prepare the soil with different textures i e clay loam and sand that were later inoculated with cyanobacteria 2 2 preparation of the cyanobacterial inoculum we used the methodologies proposed by whitton and potts 2012 and kheirfam and roohi 2020 to isolate identify purify and proliferate the native cyanobacteria from the collected soil samples accordingly the bold basal bg11 and chu10 media were used to isolate cyanobacteria andersen 2005 kheirfam et al 2020 we then used the morphological enzymatic and biochemical methods to identify the isolated cyanobacteria at the genus level garrity et al 2001 whitton and potts 2012 lababpour and kaviani 2016 although the molecular identification method is certainly of high accuracy especially for species level identification the method applied in this study is also acceptable when identifying cyanobacteria at the genus level strunecký et al 2013 komárek et al 2014 accordingly we focused on the genus level of cyanobacteria for soil inoculation kheirfam and roohi 2020 among all identified cyanobacteria from the study soil nostoc sp with a dominance share of 70 and oscillatoria sp with a dominance share of 25 were selected as the inoculation options due to their greater predominance in the soil as well studies reporting their high capability in improving the soil properties kheirfam et al 2017a 2017b and 2020 kheirfam and roohi 2020 sadeghi et al 2017 and 2021 the share of other cyanobacteria i e lyngbya sp and phormidium sp and aphanothece sp in the studied soil was about 5 we then used chu10 as a selective medium to purify nostoc sp with a share of 73 and oscillatoria sp with a share of 27 from other cyanobacteria the purified cyanobacteria were transferred to large glass bottles containing chu10 media and then placed in an automatic culture box under 14 10 h light dark cycles at 26 1 5 c for 80 days whitton and potts 2012 to proliferate the desired density of the cyanobacteria inoculum 1 5 g l 1 of dry weight kheirfam et al 2020 kheirfam and roohi 2020 during the proliferation process we regularly monitored the changes occurring in the density cfu of cyanobacteria using the optical density od in the spectrophotometry as well as applying the neubauer chamber cells counting based on high resolution optical microscopes methods janssen et al 2002 at the end of the proliferation period to ensure the desired density of cyanobacteria 20 ml of the inoculum was centrifuged 8000 rpm for 15 min at 4 c freeze dried and then weighted ansari and fatma 2016 this confirmed that the density reached 1 5 g l 1 of dry weight 2 3 experiment setup and soil inoculation according to the usda soil particle size classifications the homogenized and air dried bulk soils samples were passed through a series of x 0 002 0 002 x 0 05 and 0 005 x 2 mm sieves to separate three groups of the fine moderate and course size soils respectively then the clay silt and sand percentages of each of the above mentioned sifted soils were determined using a hydrometer method gee and or 2002 afterward we tried to prepare three types of clay loam and sand soil textures by combining a certain percentage of fine moderate and coarse size soils to validate the experiments related to the soil textures the particle size analysis of the three types of soil textures were re determined using a hydrometer method then they were matched to the usda soil texture triangle gee and or 2002 detailed information of the prepared textures is provided in table 1 as previously mentioned this experiment was performed under controlled conditions to reduce the effects of other environmental factors controlled environments enable us to vary single factors in order to isolate their effects in the controlled environments the variance experiment errors of data is low and therefore three replications are sufficient for each treatment scheiner and gurevitch 1993 following this we designed three replicates of the six treatments 18 experimental cylinders i inoculated and ii un inoculated control clay texture soil iii inoculated and iv un inoculated control loam texture soil and v inoculated and vi un inoculated control sand texture soil the plexiglass cylinders 5 cm height x 4 cm inner diameter bromly et al 2007 were filled with the prepared clay loam and sand soils using the dry packing method to achieve a homogeneous and similar bulk density table 1 as well as avoiding preferential flow paths oliviera et al 1996 plummer 2004 lewis and sjöstrom 2010 rezaei et al 2021 we deposited thin layers in the increments of 0 2 0 3 cm of the dry soil particles into the cylinders while compacting with a wooden pestle and vibrating them oliviera et al 1996 plummer 2004 the soil surface was lightly scarified after compacting each lift to avoid layering plummer 2004 then a layer of cotton cloth was fastened on the bottom of the cylinders chen et al 2018 the experiment soils were saturated and then left to remove the drainable water of the cylinders sadeghi et al 2017 in this study the bulk density values of the prepared soil samples table 1 were in the expected ranges of columns packed with different soil textures lewis and sjöstrom 2010 for soil inoculation 1 l of the proliferated cyanobacteria containing 1 5 g l 1 of the cyanobacterial dry weight was centrifuged 8000 rpm for 15 min at 4 c washed and then dissolved in 1 l sterile water to prepare an inoculum without any chu10 medium ansari and fatma 2016 next 3 ml 1 5 g m 2 of dry weight of the prepared cyanobacteria suspension was inoculated on the intended experimental cylinders using a hand sprayer kheirfam and roohi 2020 along with the inoculated cylinders soil we defined soil cylinders corresponding to each soil texture as the control treatments without any cyanobacteria inoculation thus 3 ml of the sterile water was sprayed on each control cylinder to eliminate the effect of water added in the inoculation treatments the inoculated cylinders were then placed with changing location on a daily basis in the environmental sciences laboratory at urmia lake research institute urmia university iran under 14 10 h light dark cycles at a temperature of 26 1 5 c and with relative humidity of 60 10 for 35 days kheirfam and asadzadeh 2020 in this study all measurements of the mcc using both the sandbox apparatus and pressure plate apparatus and shc were conducted on the same cylinders and in a constant temperature room 2 4 measurement of the soil moisture characteristic curve mcc the soil water content was determined at the tension heads of 0 0 3 0 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 and 10 kpa in the sandbox apparatus eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment giesbeek the netherlands using the hanging water column method stakman et al 1969 to increase the accuracy of the measurements the sand soil treatments were separately placed in the sandbox during the measurements the lid of the sandbox was closed to prevent evaporation from the surface of the cylinders the mcc measurements were continued at higher tension heads i e 30 60 100 and 200 kpa using the standard pressure plate apparatus soilmoisture equipment santa barbara ca usa wherein pressure was applied above the soil cylinders cresswell et al 2008 we did not continue the measurements at pressures greater than 200 kpa to prevent the cyanobacterial cells from bursting as previously observed before starting measurements in both devices all cylinders were first fully saturated by distilled water in addition the measurements at each tension head were continued until the difference between the last two water contents was insignificant rezaei et al 2021 the soil water content of the experimental cylinders containing treatments was determined by weighing 0 001 g them before and after drying at 105 c for 24 h rasa et al 2018 finally by the soil density the volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 was calculated as 2 5 measurement of the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity shc we used the constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 to measure the shc values of the treatments which are widely used for the laboratory measurement of the shc due to its low cost simplicity and detailed definition of the flow conditions jačka et al 2014 the shc was determined using the darcy s law by maintaining constant head boundaries in the inlet and outlet cylinders and measuring the flow rate at a steady state jačka et al 2014 2 6 measurement of the soil surface structure and quality we measured the treatments involving the soil particle connection as a key indicator representing the success rate of the inoculated cyanobacteria in improving the soil surface properties as they could play an important role in determining the mcc and shc behavior sadeghi et al 2020a we therefore used the method proposed by kheirfam and roohi 2020 to sample the treatments to describe this briefly at the end of the experimental period a 1 cm layer 0 1 0 2 g was taken from the surface of the cylinders and then placed in plastics and stored at 4 c paul 2014 afterward the soil particle connection was depicted by scanning electron microscopy sem imaging from an area of 1 cm2 kheirfam and asadzadeh 2020 as soil nutrients e g nitrogen and carbon are known as some important soil quality indicators muñoz rojas et al 2016 kheirfam et al 2017a we measured the total organic nitrogen n and the total organic carbon c using the methods developed by walkley and black 1934 and kjeldahl 1883 respectively 2 7 statistical analyses we used the shapiro wilk and levene s tests to confirm the collected data normality and the homogeneity of variance respectively the data followed the gaussian distribution and homogeneity of variances in this study we had four dependent variables the mcc shc n and c and three factors treatments textures and tension heads the experimental design in tests was a 2 3 factorial experiment with two levels of treatment and three levels of soil texture hence by the general linear model glm procedure was used to analyze the data the compare means of different treatments textures as well as tension heads and their interactions were carried out using the tukey s hsd test at the 95 confidence level the statistical analysis system version 9 4 sas institute cary nc usa was used for the analyses 3 results 3 1 soil moisture characteristic curve mcc the results showed that the mcc in the clay loam and sand soils had a different behavior fig 1 however the soil water content in all treatments was simultaneously decreased with increasing the tension head fig 1 in the control no inoculation treatment the soil water content in the clay loam and sand soils was 69 13 37 92 58 35 27 70 and 24 41 8 41 from the tension heads of 0 200 kpa respectively fig 1 on the other hand in the cyanobacteria inoculated treatments they varied from 68 65 to 37 21 65 30 36 28 and 31 23 15 69 respectively fig 1 our results also showed that the mcc had the same behavior in the clay texture for both control and cyanobacterial inoculation treatments fig 1a the rate of the soil moisture loss in different tension heads 0 200 kpa was the same for these treatments the results of the glm analysis indicated that the soil mcc in different treatments textures and tension heads were significantly different p 0 01 table 2 in addition the interaction between treatments and textures as well as textures and tension heads was significant p 0 01 table 2 we observed that there was a significant difference p 0 05 between inoculated 39 89 1 29 and control 34 99 1 12 treatments the volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 100 in the inoculation treatment was 14 higher than the control the results also showed that the volumetric soil water content in different textures were significantly different from each other p 0 05 so that its values in clay 48 99 1 05 texture were 16 and 134 higher than loam 39 89 1 02 and sand 39 89 0 62 textures respectively in addition the volumetric soil water content of the loam texture was 102 higher than that of the sand texture fig 3 our results showed that the inoculation of cyanobacteria was not effective in improving the clay soil water content fig 2 unlike clay soil the inoculation of cyanobacteria had significant effects p 0 05 fig 2 on the volumetric soil water content in the loam and sand soils fig 2 cyanobacteria increased the volumetric soil water content of the loam 12 31 an average 21 relative changes and sand 25 86 an average 40 relative changes soils in comparison to their controls uninoculated soils our results also indicated that the role of cyanobacteria in holding soil water in the loam and sand soils became more noticeable as compared to the control treatment the results showed that the highest volumetric soil water content 69 13 2 81 was measured in the clay texture of the control treatment at the tension head of 0 kpa meanwhile the lowest volumetric soil water content was measured in the sand texture of the control treatment at the tension head of 200 8 41 0 95 kpa table 3 3 2 soil saturated hydraulic conductivity shc the results of the glm analysis showed that the soil shc had significant differences in the different treatments and textures p 0 01 table 4 the measurement results therefore showed that in the control treatment the shc values for the clay loam and sand textures were 0 42 0 09 0 54 0 03 and 1 21 0 12 cm min 1 respectively fig 3 we observed that in the soils inoculated with cyanobacteria the shc values for the clay loam and sand textures were 0 37 0 06 0 50 0 03 and 0 67 0 01 cm min 1 respectively fig 3 our results also showed that the shc value in clay and loam textures was not significantly different for the control and cyanobacteria inoculation treatments fig 3 however in the sand texture cyanobacteria had a significant effect on reducing the shc 44 as compared to the control fig 3 3 3 soil physical changes the sem imaging from the soil surface of the experiment cylinders showed that the soil particles binding was different in the treatments without control and with inoculation of cyanobacteria fig 4 in the control treatment of the clay soil we observed the limited porous space and regular aggregates composed of colloidal and very fine soil particles fig 4a meanwhile the inoculation of cyanobacteria led to the binding of fine clay particles to each other making the limited space of clay soil even more limited fig 4b the sem images of the loam soil surface also showed non uniformity in terms of particle size and poor binding of the soil particles in the control treatment fig 4c however in the loam soils inoculated with cyanobacteria intertwined bonds were formed between soil particles leading to the aggregation of fine soil particles with each other fig 4d according to the sem images we also observed large particles with notable porous spaces and without any binding in the control treatment of the sand texture fig 4e meanwhile the sem images obtained from the inoculated sand soils showed that cyanobacteria could bind large and non stick particles together as a result larger aggregates were formed by binding some soil particles fig 4f however the sem images showed a reduction in the porous space between the sand soil particles due to the inoculation of cyanobacteria fig 4f 3 4 soil chemical changes according to the glm analysis table 5 the study soil carbon and nitrogen content were significantly different in the treatments and textures p 0 01 however the interaction between treatments and textures was not significant p 0 05 table 5 the results also showed that in the control treatment the organic nitrogen values were 1 52 clay 1 30 loam and 0 98 sand g kg 1 fig 5a and the organic carbon values were 5 83 clay 5 12 loam and 4 08 sand g kg 1 fig 5b however we found that in the cyanobacteria inoculation treatments the organic nitrogen values were 1 77 1 55 and 1 44 g kg 1 for the clay loam and sand textures respectively fig 5a in these treatments the organic carbon values were also 6 66 6 11 and 5 36 g kg 1 for the clay loam and sand textures respectively fig 5b the results also revealed that cyanobacteria significantly p 0 05 increased the nitrogen 16 47 and carbon 14 31 content in the clay loam and sand soils the highest and lowest rates of carbon and nitrogen increase were found in the sand and clay soils respectively 4 discussion poor drainage potential in the clay finer particle size soils and the short term water retention in the sand coarse grained particle size ones could be regarded as the serious challenges the irrigation management face in agricultural lands thiam et al 2019 however the mcc and shc as important soil environmental variables play an essential role in the optimal management of irrigation lehmann et al 2018 the moisture content in the porous space between soil particles provides the conditions for establishing vegetation as well as increasing the solubility and availability of the nutrients zarebanadkouki et al 2016 since we found that the mcc and shc behaved differently in all three clay loam and sand soils table 2 and fig 3 it was inevitable to manage the mentioned components in different soil textures our results showed that the amount of the soil water remaining in the clay texture was high under different tension heads 0 200 kpa fig 1a which could be taken as one of the limitations affecting irrigation and drainage management paudel et al 2017 smith et al 2001 have also reported similar moisture curves for the clay soil with the bulk density being the same as that in our study see their fig 1a implementing some strategies to increase the shc values in clay soils to accelerate the water discharge can be considered as a solution to cope with these limitations lo et al 2017 as we evaluated the success of soil inoculation with cyanobacteria however the inoculation of cyanobacteria in the soil with the clay texture had no significant effect on the mcc and shc figs 4 and 5 meanwhile the inoculated cyanobacteria significantly increased the capacity of water retention in the loam and sand soils as compared to the control treatment without any inoculation of cyanobacteria that sun et al 2021 found a similar result in the developed biocrusts in this regard guan and liu 2021 also reported that the biocrust development influences the mcc and thereby altering the available water in the soil crust the increase of the soil water content in the inoculated loam and sand soils could be attributed to the ability of cyanobacteria to absorb and retain water sadeghi et al 2020a the inoculated cyanobacteria can absorb the soil environment moisture by their cells up to 12 times of their cell volume powell et al 2015 in our case after the inoculation of the high dens biomass of cyanobacteria on the loam and sand soils they absorbed a significant amount of soil water thus the moisture retention on the surface of these soils was increased significantly in this regard sadeghi and et al 2017 2020a and kheirfam et al 2020 found that the inoculation of cyanobacteria on the degraded coarse grained soils led to the maximum uptake of rainwater in the early rainfall times which enhanced the ability of the soil surface to increase the water retention capacity the secreted epss by cyanobacteria especially nostoc sp and oscillatoria sp as used in this study helped them to adhere around soil particles creating a viscous and absorbent coating around soils muñoz rojas et al 2018 this sticky coating of the cyanobacteria cells could act as a micro super jelly absorbent improving the mcc in the medium and coarse grained particle sizes rossi and de philippis 2015 sadeghi et al 2017 in addition to cyanobacterial cells their epss secretions are also known as one of the prominent features of cyanobacteria that have a high ability to absorb and retain water sadeghi et al 2020a in this regard sadeghi et al 2017 also found that the expansion of cyanobacterial filaments around the soil particles surface layer created micro channels with the water absorbing ability which helped to increase the mcc in the soils with fairly low silt clay contents as occurred in our loam and sand soils too particle compaction and the limited porous space in the clay soils could inhibit the growth of cyanobacteria as a result the cyanobacterial cells epss and filaments are confined to the upper soil surface 1 mm and can not penetrate the sublayers 1 mm therefore the role of cyanobacteria in changing the mcc behavior was not significant in the clay texture in line with our results chamizo et al 2019 also found the lowest concentrations of epss and chlorophyll as the representative of the cyanobacteria biomass in fine grained heavy textured soils as compared to the medium and coarse grained ones on the other hand rozenstein et al 2014 and mugnai et al 2020 found that the cyanobacteria growth can be also limited on coarse grained particle size soils due to the instability of these soils therefore it is possible that either very fine or very coarse soils are not suitable substrates for cyanobacterial growth in the coarse grained particle size soils fairly low nutrient e g carbon and nitrogen contents due to the leaching process could lead to the low mcc and high shc wang et al 2020 along with the use of various amendments the effect of soil inoculation by cyanobacteria on increasing the nutrient content especially carbon and nitrogen in the sand soils has been confirmed kheirfam and roohi 2020 as observed in this study fig 5 nostoc sp and oscillatoria sp cyanobacteria used in this study are known as nitrogen fixing and carbon storing organisms kheirfam et al 2017a peng and bruns 2019 they could convert the atmospheric nitrogen to ammonium or nitrate by their nitrogenase enzymes and the atmospheric carbon dioxide to oxygen and the carbon hydrogen oxygen form of the organic compounds by their photosynthetic capability rossi et al 2015 additionally the epss secretion of the cyanobacteria content represented 9 18 on average 13 1 of the organic carbon chamizo et al 2018 which could significantly increase the soil carbon content in addition to the direct role of inoculated cyanobacteria in nitrogen fixation the rapid increase in soil carbon content could enhance the flux of the ambient nitrogen to the soil to balance the carbon to nitrogen ratio kheirfam et al 2017a although nitrogen fixation and especially carbon sequestration is a time consuming process in ecosystems cyanobacteria dominated biological soil crusts can accelerate these processes kheirfam and roohi 2020 a significant and rapid increase of soil carbon and nitrogen content shortly after the inoculation of cyanobacteria has been reported by acea et al 2003 60 days nisha et al 2007 45 days chamizo et al 2018 90 days kheirfam et al 2017a 38 days and kheirfam 2020 60 days the high nutrient content in the soil surface could lead to improving the soil aggregation ucgul et al 2015 increasing the soil surface water retention capacity sadeghi et al 2020a and reducing the soil shc brevik et al 2006 in addition to the high ability of cyanobacteria to increase the capacity of the soil environment to absorb and retain water they could gradually discharge the water absorbed by their cells due to high external tension heads wang et al 2009 sadeghi et al 2020a therefore they reduce the soil shc especially in the sand soils the shc in the coarse grained soils was high due to their high porosity and poor content of colloidal particles leading to the rapid loss of water from the soil environment meanwhile the inoculation of cyanobacteria into the sand soil surface led to the occupation of the porous space of the soil environment and the mcc increase thus decreasing the shc however the slight development of cyanobacteria and the insufficient space for them to swell could limit the absorption of water by cyanobacterial cells in the clay soil in this regard wang et al 2009 found that the shc had a negative correlation with the cyanobacterial polysaccharide secretions which promoted water retention in the surface layer of the sand soils the increase of water content in the natural cyanobacteria dominated biological soil crusts chamizo et al 2012 and restored degraded soils by the inoculation of cyanobacteria sadeghi et al 2017 and 2020b kheirfam and roohi 2020 has been confirmed however we observed a slight difference in the shc between clay and loam soils this could be due to the small scale experiment the low difference between the bulk density of the clay and loam soils and the simulation of soil textures our findings therefore approved that cyanobacteria could improve the mcc and shc of medium and coarse grained soils however it was not affordable for the fine grained soil due to its negligible impact so the inoculation of cyanobacteria had a positive effect on improving some important physical and chemical properties of all three soil clay loam and sand textures despite the desirable results obtained by this study we should emphasize that the durability functionality and effectiveness of the inoculated cyanobacteria have not yet been investigated under natural conditions thus requiring further research suitable species inoculation time and optimal inoculant biomass should be explored by comprehensive laboratory field studies in this regard moisture limitation desiccation and ultraviolet radiation are known as the major challenges for field scale inoculation cyanobacteria samolov et al 2020 kheirfam et al 2020 resolved these challenges by planning the inoculation time in the wet and temperate seasons i e spring additionally chen et al 2013 suggested the use of uv irradiance resistant cyanobacteria such as nostoc sp as also applied in one of our inoculation options furthermore although laboratory results showed the good impacts of the cyanobacteria inoculation in managing the mcc and shc behavior implementation of the inoculation techniques on a field scale will face several challenges including inoculation tools and its cost effectiveness therefore the use of agricultural aircraft has been introduced as another option for the widspread inoculation of cyanobacteria in large scale projects sears and prithiviraj 2012 on the other hand sadeghi et al 2020a found that the soil inoculation with cyanobacteria usd 350 ha 1 is an economically efficient technique in comparison to the other common amendments including biochar usd 8000 ha 1 polyacrylamides usd 1000 ha 1 and straw mulch usd 750 ha 1 the durability and stability of the artificially formed recovered biological soil crust by cyanobacteria inoculation could be regarded as one of the major challenges chamizo et al 2018 kheirfam and asadzadeh 2020 found that not only the inoculated cyanobacteria had short term effects on improving the soil components but also their impacts persisted for a long time due to the strong structures created by their filaments 5 conclusion a fine grained particle size with poor drainage potential e g clay texture high low mcc shc and a coarse grained particle size with short term water retention e g sand texture low high mcc shc could be regarded as a major challenge for agricultural water management however this can be adjusted if the soil texture is amended our experiment showed that the artificial increase of soil cyanobacteria with the help of the inoculation technique could address the water retention behavior of different soil textures we also found that the soil inoculation method increased the coarse grained particle size soils especially the sand texture and the potential to retain water which could be regarded as a way to reduce the frequency of irrigation in farms our findings also showed that cyanobacteria could increase decrease the mcc shc of the medium and coarse grained soils loam and sand textures therefore this could help to increase the amount and duration of the available moisture in these soils however this may not always contribute to the drainage management of the loam soils despite the promising results obtained for the cyanobacteria inoculation in the coarse grained soils the soil water behavior i e mcc shc of the clay texture soil was not changed thus other strategies and or amendments are required cyanobacteria improved the potential of the coarse grained soils to increase the amount high mcc and duration low shc of water retention in different ways such as secretion of epss development of cyanobacterial filaments in the soil surface layer and the increase of soil nutrients e g carbon and nitrogen enhancing water absorption and retention in the soil although the undesirable texture of agricultural soils could be successfully ameliorated by inoculating cyanobacteria to help the better management of agricultural water further research is needed to find ways to ensure its up scaling defining similar experiments on structurally undisturbed and intact soil samples as well as in field conditions is another of our suggestions for future research funding this

9354,ecosystem based approaches including soil inoculation have been considered to improve the soil water behavior for the purpose of ensuring better irrigation management on farms this study was therefore conducted to assess the responses of the moisture characteristic curve mcc and saturated hydraulic conductivity shc to soil inoculation with cyanobacteria to this end the most suitable existing cyanobacteria i e nostoc sp and oscillatoria sp from the original soil were inoculated on clay loam and sand textures at a small cylinder scale after 35 days the mcc and shc of the treatments six control and inoculation treatments in three repetitions were measured using the sandbox and pressure plate and constant head method respectively the results showed that in the control treatment the volumetric water content of the clay loam and sand textures was 38 69 28 58 and 8 24 respectively meanwhile the inoculation of cyanobacteria led to a significant p 0 05 increase in the mcc of the loam and sand soils their values were 36 65 and 16 31 respectively in the control the shc of the clay loam and sand textures was 0 42 0 54 and 1 21 cm min 1 respectively meanwhile this was 0 37 0 50 and 0 67 cm min 1 for the inoculated treatments respectively on the other hand the inoculated cyanobacteria reduced the shc of the sand soils by 44 we also found that the inoculated cyanobacteria perceptibly improved the soil surface physical and chemical properties which could play a key role in determining the soil hydraulic and hydrologic behavior overall we found that soil inoculation with cyanobacteria could be an effective approach in improving the soil water behavior especially in coarse texture soils thus it could serve as a suitable irrigation and drainage management method in agricultural lands keywords bioengineering irrigation management soil inoculation soil water behavior water retention data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the united nations un has recently drawn up the sustainable development goals sdgs in three domains economic social and environmental all to address worldwide challenges such as water crisis and food security by 2030 randers et al 2018 despite this global focus achieving a sustainable economy and society will not be possible unless there is success in the environmental domain visser et al 2019 among the environment domain layers soil water movement transfer management in agricultural lands can help to achieve water use efficiency and sustainable food production as identified in the un sdgs keesstra et al 2018 the processes of soil water movement depend on the hydraulic and hydrological characteristics of the soil especially the soil moisture characteristic curve mcc and saturated hydraulic conductivity shc lo et al 2017 soil surface characteristics especially soil texture can affect both mcc and shc wang et al 2017 in the case of unfavorable soil textures for agriculture disruption of water and solute transport from the soil surface to the subsoil can make it impossible to optimally manage irrigation in agricultural lands rezaei et al 2017 fine grained soils as clay texture soils pose various challenges in agricultural lands such as poor air ventilation ponding water plant suffocation high irrigation runoff low infiltration rate low porosity and pollutants accumulation de andrade bonetti et al 2017 there are also challenges in regard to coarse grained soils as in the sand texture ones e g nutrients leaching low water holding capacity poverty of organic matter and high frequency of irrigation de andrade bonetti et al 2017 accordingly the shc mcc low high values in the fine and coarse textured soils are the main limitations affecting the irrigation programs it seems therefore that the improvement of such soils can be taken a step forward to achieve sustainable agriculture along with the efficient use of water rahmati et al 2018 therefore there is a global interest in implementing some effective measures to manage the shc and mcc behavior in the fine and coarse textured soils to this end various ways have been used to improve and modify the texture and other characteristics of the soil surface that control shc and mcc such as amelioration of soil properties sadeghi et al 2018 for this a wide range of natural and artificial amendments have been proposed viz sawdust and wood ash biochars municipal wastes gypsum and lime sadeghi et al 2018 composts manures agricultural and food industries residues urra et al 2019 and biodegradable polymers moreira et al 2018 however despite the good results reported following such amendments some problems have limited their widespread use these are related to economy environment applicability accessibility and instability rumpel et al 2015 alam 2018 therefore it seems necessary to develop methods not subject to these restrictions as well they have been classified as eco friendly and technically proficient strategies sadeghi et al 2020a the soil inoculation especially with cyanobacteria is one of the approaches considered today kheirfam et al 2017a and b mugnai et al 2018 chamizo et al 2018 kheirfam et al 2020 kheirfam and roohi 2020 cyanobacteria are photo autotrophic micro organisms known as the key and pioneer living organisms in the soil crusts especially in drylands garcia pichel and wojciechowski 2009 cyanobacteria can also provide the nutrient sources for other living heterotrophic micro and macro organisms on the top soil lan et al 2015 by nitrogen fixation and carbon sequestration in soil kheirfam et al 2017a kheirfam 2020 as well as secretion of nutritious exopolysaccharides epss roncero ramos et al 2019 furthermore the substances produced by cyanobacteria especially epss have a sticky nature building soil aggregates through binding soil fine particles to each other colica et al 2014 in addition to epss the cyanobacterial filamentary structure can create soil micro networks by connecting soil aggregates together kheirfam and asadzadeh 2020 indeed the creation of stable and larger size soils leads to amending the soil surface porosity sadeghi et al 2020a aggregation crouzet et al 2019 and water retention capacity adessi et al 2018 thereby providing some soil environmental conditions suitable for improving the soil shc and mcc in the soil crusts with inherent cyanobacterial poverty even in the presence of other micro organisms the role of cyanobacteria in improving the soil properties may be imperceptible kheirfam and roohi 2020 or this may happen in a long term period belnap et al 2014 therefore soil inoculation with a high density of cyanobacteria inoculum especially the native species could be a fast strategy to improve the top soil characteristics kheirfam et al 2020 sadeghi et al 2020b this may affect the soil shc and mcc behavior the available literature shows that different soil textures in agricultural lands can significantly affect the behavior of the soil shc and mcc subsequently creating complexities in the optimal irrigation management as well as crop production rahmati et al 2018 the slow discharge of drainable water low shc in fine grained clay and loam and low water holding capacity and high shc in coarse grained sand soils are known as the main challenges in irrigating farms through the high efficiency management rahmati et al 2018 on the other hand the artificial increase of soil cyanobacteria population density using inoculation based techniques has been successfully implemented to improve the soil functionality kheirfam et al 2017a chamizo et al 2018 muñoz rojas et al 2018 kheirfam 2020 to reduce soil erosion and runoff yield kheirfam et al 2017b and 2020 sadeghi et al 2017 and 2020a and b to control wind induced sand flowing kheirfam and asadzadeh 2020 to promote the formation of biological soil crusts in bare sandy substrates mugnai et al 2018 and to restore the degraded lands kheirfam and roohi 2020 accordingly we hypothesized that the soil inoculation with the native cyanobacteria biomass in the top soil of various textures i e clay loam and sand could be regarded as an effective time saving strategy to improve the soil shc and mcc as the main variables affecting the agricultural water management hence the cyanobacterial inoculation technique can be introduced as an innovative idea for the irrigation and drainage management in agricultural lands this has previously received less attention to address this knowledge gap it is necessary to assess how the soil hydraulic properties vary with cyanobacterial inoculation in various textures therefore the main objective of this study are to investigate the effect of the cyanobacterial inoculation on the soil shc and mcc behavior in three different soil textures under laboratory conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil collection site and sampling the studied soil was collected from the research farm of urmia university west azerbaijan province nw iran at 44 58 to 44 59 5 e longitudes and 37 38 5 to 37 40 n latitudes the mean annual precipitation is about 327 mm with a mean annual potential evapotranspiration of 1504 mm and the mean annual temperature of 9 8 c representing cold temperate and semi arid zones the study site soil texture the original soil at site was classified as a clay loam one with the sand silt and clay content of 30 36 and 34 respectively the organic matter and nitrogen of the study soil were 5 51 and 1 39 g kg 1 respectively the origin soil bulk density electrical conductivity and ph were also 1 35 g cm 3 0 45 ds m 1 and 8 4 respectively to prepare the inoculum we collected 10 soil samples from the upper 5 cm layer of the research site using corings of polyvinyl chloride to isolate the native cyanobacteria kheirfam et al 2017a the collected samples were air dried immediately mixed thoroughly and sieved to 4 mm to use them for the isolation stage as described in the next section we tried to keep all affecting factors similar in both inoculated and control treatments in order to assess just the role of inoculation of cyanobacteria on soil hydraulic properties accordingly we collected other bulk samples from the study site 0 10 cm depth then they were homogenized and air dried to prepare the soil with different textures i e clay loam and sand that were later inoculated with cyanobacteria 2 2 preparation of the cyanobacterial inoculum we used the methodologies proposed by whitton and potts 2012 and kheirfam and roohi 2020 to isolate identify purify and proliferate the native cyanobacteria from the collected soil samples accordingly the bold basal bg11 and chu10 media were used to isolate cyanobacteria andersen 2005 kheirfam et al 2020 we then used the morphological enzymatic and biochemical methods to identify the isolated cyanobacteria at the genus level garrity et al 2001 whitton and potts 2012 lababpour and kaviani 2016 although the molecular identification method is certainly of high accuracy especially for species level identification the method applied in this study is also acceptable when identifying cyanobacteria at the genus level strunecký et al 2013 komárek et al 2014 accordingly we focused on the genus level of cyanobacteria for soil inoculation kheirfam and roohi 2020 among all identified cyanobacteria from the study soil nostoc sp with a dominance share of 70 and oscillatoria sp with a dominance share of 25 were selected as the inoculation options due to their greater predominance in the soil as well studies reporting their high capability in improving the soil properties kheirfam et al 2017a 2017b and 2020 kheirfam and roohi 2020 sadeghi et al 2017 and 2021 the share of other cyanobacteria i e lyngbya sp and phormidium sp and aphanothece sp in the studied soil was about 5 we then used chu10 as a selective medium to purify nostoc sp with a share of 73 and oscillatoria sp with a share of 27 from other cyanobacteria the purified cyanobacteria were transferred to large glass bottles containing chu10 media and then placed in an automatic culture box under 14 10 h light dark cycles at 26 1 5 c for 80 days whitton and potts 2012 to proliferate the desired density of the cyanobacteria inoculum 1 5 g l 1 of dry weight kheirfam et al 2020 kheirfam and roohi 2020 during the proliferation process we regularly monitored the changes occurring in the density cfu of cyanobacteria using the optical density od in the spectrophotometry as well as applying the neubauer chamber cells counting based on high resolution optical microscopes methods janssen et al 2002 at the end of the proliferation period to ensure the desired density of cyanobacteria 20 ml of the inoculum was centrifuged 8000 rpm for 15 min at 4 c freeze dried and then weighted ansari and fatma 2016 this confirmed that the density reached 1 5 g l 1 of dry weight 2 3 experiment setup and soil inoculation according to the usda soil particle size classifications the homogenized and air dried bulk soils samples were passed through a series of x 0 002 0 002 x 0 05 and 0 005 x 2 mm sieves to separate three groups of the fine moderate and course size soils respectively then the clay silt and sand percentages of each of the above mentioned sifted soils were determined using a hydrometer method gee and or 2002 afterward we tried to prepare three types of clay loam and sand soil textures by combining a certain percentage of fine moderate and coarse size soils to validate the experiments related to the soil textures the particle size analysis of the three types of soil textures were re determined using a hydrometer method then they were matched to the usda soil texture triangle gee and or 2002 detailed information of the prepared textures is provided in table 1 as previously mentioned this experiment was performed under controlled conditions to reduce the effects of other environmental factors controlled environments enable us to vary single factors in order to isolate their effects in the controlled environments the variance experiment errors of data is low and therefore three replications are sufficient for each treatment scheiner and gurevitch 1993 following this we designed three replicates of the six treatments 18 experimental cylinders i inoculated and ii un inoculated control clay texture soil iii inoculated and iv un inoculated control loam texture soil and v inoculated and vi un inoculated control sand texture soil the plexiglass cylinders 5 cm height x 4 cm inner diameter bromly et al 2007 were filled with the prepared clay loam and sand soils using the dry packing method to achieve a homogeneous and similar bulk density table 1 as well as avoiding preferential flow paths oliviera et al 1996 plummer 2004 lewis and sjöstrom 2010 rezaei et al 2021 we deposited thin layers in the increments of 0 2 0 3 cm of the dry soil particles into the cylinders while compacting with a wooden pestle and vibrating them oliviera et al 1996 plummer 2004 the soil surface was lightly scarified after compacting each lift to avoid layering plummer 2004 then a layer of cotton cloth was fastened on the bottom of the cylinders chen et al 2018 the experiment soils were saturated and then left to remove the drainable water of the cylinders sadeghi et al 2017 in this study the bulk density values of the prepared soil samples table 1 were in the expected ranges of columns packed with different soil textures lewis and sjöstrom 2010 for soil inoculation 1 l of the proliferated cyanobacteria containing 1 5 g l 1 of the cyanobacterial dry weight was centrifuged 8000 rpm for 15 min at 4 c washed and then dissolved in 1 l sterile water to prepare an inoculum without any chu10 medium ansari and fatma 2016 next 3 ml 1 5 g m 2 of dry weight of the prepared cyanobacteria suspension was inoculated on the intended experimental cylinders using a hand sprayer kheirfam and roohi 2020 along with the inoculated cylinders soil we defined soil cylinders corresponding to each soil texture as the control treatments without any cyanobacteria inoculation thus 3 ml of the sterile water was sprayed on each control cylinder to eliminate the effect of water added in the inoculation treatments the inoculated cylinders were then placed with changing location on a daily basis in the environmental sciences laboratory at urmia lake research institute urmia university iran under 14 10 h light dark cycles at a temperature of 26 1 5 c and with relative humidity of 60 10 for 35 days kheirfam and asadzadeh 2020 in this study all measurements of the mcc using both the sandbox apparatus and pressure plate apparatus and shc were conducted on the same cylinders and in a constant temperature room 2 4 measurement of the soil moisture characteristic curve mcc the soil water content was determined at the tension heads of 0 0 3 0 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 and 10 kpa in the sandbox apparatus eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment giesbeek the netherlands using the hanging water column method stakman et al 1969 to increase the accuracy of the measurements the sand soil treatments were separately placed in the sandbox during the measurements the lid of the sandbox was closed to prevent evaporation from the surface of the cylinders the mcc measurements were continued at higher tension heads i e 30 60 100 and 200 kpa using the standard pressure plate apparatus soilmoisture equipment santa barbara ca usa wherein pressure was applied above the soil cylinders cresswell et al 2008 we did not continue the measurements at pressures greater than 200 kpa to prevent the cyanobacterial cells from bursting as previously observed before starting measurements in both devices all cylinders were first fully saturated by distilled water in addition the measurements at each tension head were continued until the difference between the last two water contents was insignificant rezaei et al 2021 the soil water content of the experimental cylinders containing treatments was determined by weighing 0 001 g them before and after drying at 105 c for 24 h rasa et al 2018 finally by the soil density the volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 was calculated as 2 5 measurement of the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity shc we used the constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 to measure the shc values of the treatments which are widely used for the laboratory measurement of the shc due to its low cost simplicity and detailed definition of the flow conditions jačka et al 2014 the shc was determined using the darcy s law by maintaining constant head boundaries in the inlet and outlet cylinders and measuring the flow rate at a steady state jačka et al 2014 2 6 measurement of the soil surface structure and quality we measured the treatments involving the soil particle connection as a key indicator representing the success rate of the inoculated cyanobacteria in improving the soil surface properties as they could play an important role in determining the mcc and shc behavior sadeghi et al 2020a we therefore used the method proposed by kheirfam and roohi 2020 to sample the treatments to describe this briefly at the end of the experimental period a 1 cm layer 0 1 0 2 g was taken from the surface of the cylinders and then placed in plastics and stored at 4 c paul 2014 afterward the soil particle connection was depicted by scanning electron microscopy sem imaging from an area of 1 cm2 kheirfam and asadzadeh 2020 as soil nutrients e g nitrogen and carbon are known as some important soil quality indicators muñoz rojas et al 2016 kheirfam et al 2017a we measured the total organic nitrogen n and the total organic carbon c using the methods developed by walkley and black 1934 and kjeldahl 1883 respectively 2 7 statistical analyses we used the shapiro wilk and levene s tests to confirm the collected data normality and the homogeneity of variance respectively the data followed the gaussian distribution and homogeneity of variances in this study we had four dependent variables the mcc shc n and c and three factors treatments textures and tension heads the experimental design in tests was a 2 3 factorial experiment with two levels of treatment and three levels of soil texture hence by the general linear model glm procedure was used to analyze the data the compare means of different treatments textures as well as tension heads and their interactions were carried out using the tukey s hsd test at the 95 confidence level the statistical analysis system version 9 4 sas institute cary nc usa was used for the analyses 3 results 3 1 soil moisture characteristic curve mcc the results showed that the mcc in the clay loam and sand soils had a different behavior fig 1 however the soil water content in all treatments was simultaneously decreased with increasing the tension head fig 1 in the control no inoculation treatment the soil water content in the clay loam and sand soils was 69 13 37 92 58 35 27 70 and 24 41 8 41 from the tension heads of 0 200 kpa respectively fig 1 on the other hand in the cyanobacteria inoculated treatments they varied from 68 65 to 37 21 65 30 36 28 and 31 23 15 69 respectively fig 1 our results also showed that the mcc had the same behavior in the clay texture for both control and cyanobacterial inoculation treatments fig 1a the rate of the soil moisture loss in different tension heads 0 200 kpa was the same for these treatments the results of the glm analysis indicated that the soil mcc in different treatments textures and tension heads were significantly different p 0 01 table 2 in addition the interaction between treatments and textures as well as textures and tension heads was significant p 0 01 table 2 we observed that there was a significant difference p 0 05 between inoculated 39 89 1 29 and control 34 99 1 12 treatments the volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 100 in the inoculation treatment was 14 higher than the control the results also showed that the volumetric soil water content in different textures were significantly different from each other p 0 05 so that its values in clay 48 99 1 05 texture were 16 and 134 higher than loam 39 89 1 02 and sand 39 89 0 62 textures respectively in addition the volumetric soil water content of the loam texture was 102 higher than that of the sand texture fig 3 our results showed that the inoculation of cyanobacteria was not effective in improving the clay soil water content fig 2 unlike clay soil the inoculation of cyanobacteria had significant effects p 0 05 fig 2 on the volumetric soil water content in the loam and sand soils fig 2 cyanobacteria increased the volumetric soil water content of the loam 12 31 an average 21 relative changes and sand 25 86 an average 40 relative changes soils in comparison to their controls uninoculated soils our results also indicated that the role of cyanobacteria in holding soil water in the loam and sand soils became more noticeable as compared to the control treatment the results showed that the highest volumetric soil water content 69 13 2 81 was measured in the clay texture of the control treatment at the tension head of 0 kpa meanwhile the lowest volumetric soil water content was measured in the sand texture of the control treatment at the tension head of 200 8 41 0 95 kpa table 3 3 2 soil saturated hydraulic conductivity shc the results of the glm analysis showed that the soil shc had significant differences in the different treatments and textures p 0 01 table 4 the measurement results therefore showed that in the control treatment the shc values for the clay loam and sand textures were 0 42 0 09 0 54 0 03 and 1 21 0 12 cm min 1 respectively fig 3 we observed that in the soils inoculated with cyanobacteria the shc values for the clay loam and sand textures were 0 37 0 06 0 50 0 03 and 0 67 0 01 cm min 1 respectively fig 3 our results also showed that the shc value in clay and loam textures was not significantly different for the control and cyanobacteria inoculation treatments fig 3 however in the sand texture cyanobacteria had a significant effect on reducing the shc 44 as compared to the control fig 3 3 3 soil physical changes the sem imaging from the soil surface of the experiment cylinders showed that the soil particles binding was different in the treatments without control and with inoculation of cyanobacteria fig 4 in the control treatment of the clay soil we observed the limited porous space and regular aggregates composed of colloidal and very fine soil particles fig 4a meanwhile the inoculation of cyanobacteria led to the binding of fine clay particles to each other making the limited space of clay soil even more limited fig 4b the sem images of the loam soil surface also showed non uniformity in terms of particle size and poor binding of the soil particles in the control treatment fig 4c however in the loam soils inoculated with cyanobacteria intertwined bonds were formed between soil particles leading to the aggregation of fine soil particles with each other fig 4d according to the sem images we also observed large particles with notable porous spaces and without any binding in the control treatment of the sand texture fig 4e meanwhile the sem images obtained from the inoculated sand soils showed that cyanobacteria could bind large and non stick particles together as a result larger aggregates were formed by binding some soil particles fig 4f however the sem images showed a reduction in the porous space between the sand soil particles due to the inoculation of cyanobacteria fig 4f 3 4 soil chemical changes according to the glm analysis table 5 the study soil carbon and nitrogen content were significantly different in the treatments and textures p 0 01 however the interaction between treatments and textures was not significant p 0 05 table 5 the results also showed that in the control treatment the organic nitrogen values were 1 52 clay 1 30 loam and 0 98 sand g kg 1 fig 5a and the organic carbon values were 5 83 clay 5 12 loam and 4 08 sand g kg 1 fig 5b however we found that in the cyanobacteria inoculation treatments the organic nitrogen values were 1 77 1 55 and 1 44 g kg 1 for the clay loam and sand textures respectively fig 5a in these treatments the organic carbon values were also 6 66 6 11 and 5 36 g kg 1 for the clay loam and sand textures respectively fig 5b the results also revealed that cyanobacteria significantly p 0 05 increased the nitrogen 16 47 and carbon 14 31 content in the clay loam and sand soils the highest and lowest rates of carbon and nitrogen increase were found in the sand and clay soils respectively 4 discussion poor drainage potential in the clay finer particle size soils and the short term water retention in the sand coarse grained particle size ones could be regarded as the serious challenges the irrigation management face in agricultural lands thiam et al 2019 however the mcc and shc as important soil environmental variables play an essential role in the optimal management of irrigation lehmann et al 2018 the moisture content in the porous space between soil particles provides the conditions for establishing vegetation as well as increasing the solubility and availability of the nutrients zarebanadkouki et al 2016 since we found that the mcc and shc behaved differently in all three clay loam and sand soils table 2 and fig 3 it was inevitable to manage the mentioned components in different soil textures our results showed that the amount of the soil water remaining in the clay texture was high under different tension heads 0 200 kpa fig 1a which could be taken as one of the limitations affecting irrigation and drainage management paudel et al 2017 smith et al 2001 have also reported similar moisture curves for the clay soil with the bulk density being the same as that in our study see their fig 1a implementing some strategies to increase the shc values in clay soils to accelerate the water discharge can be considered as a solution to cope with these limitations lo et al 2017 as we evaluated the success of soil inoculation with cyanobacteria however the inoculation of cyanobacteria in the soil with the clay texture had no significant effect on the mcc and shc figs 4 and 5 meanwhile the inoculated cyanobacteria significantly increased the capacity of water retention in the loam and sand soils as compared to the control treatment without any inoculation of cyanobacteria that sun et al 2021 found a similar result in the developed biocrusts in this regard guan and liu 2021 also reported that the biocrust development influences the mcc and thereby altering the available water in the soil crust the increase of the soil water content in the inoculated loam and sand soils could be attributed to the ability of cyanobacteria to absorb and retain water sadeghi et al 2020a the inoculated cyanobacteria can absorb the soil environment moisture by their cells up to 12 times of their cell volume powell et al 2015 in our case after the inoculation of the high dens biomass of cyanobacteria on the loam and sand soils they absorbed a significant amount of soil water thus the moisture retention on the surface of these soils was increased significantly in this regard sadeghi and et al 2017 2020a and kheirfam et al 2020 found that the inoculation of cyanobacteria on the degraded coarse grained soils led to the maximum uptake of rainwater in the early rainfall times which enhanced the ability of the soil surface to increase the water retention capacity the secreted epss by cyanobacteria especially nostoc sp and oscillatoria sp as used in this study helped them to adhere around soil particles creating a viscous and absorbent coating around soils muñoz rojas et al 2018 this sticky coating of the cyanobacteria cells could act as a micro super jelly absorbent improving the mcc in the medium and coarse grained particle sizes rossi and de philippis 2015 sadeghi et al 2017 in addition to cyanobacterial cells their epss secretions are also known as one of the prominent features of cyanobacteria that have a high ability to absorb and retain water sadeghi et al 2020a in this regard sadeghi et al 2017 also found that the expansion of cyanobacterial filaments around the soil particles surface layer created micro channels with the water absorbing ability which helped to increase the mcc in the soils with fairly low silt clay contents as occurred in our loam and sand soils too particle compaction and the limited porous space in the clay soils could inhibit the growth of cyanobacteria as a result the cyanobacterial cells epss and filaments are confined to the upper soil surface 1 mm and can not penetrate the sublayers 1 mm therefore the role of cyanobacteria in changing the mcc behavior was not significant in the clay texture in line with our results chamizo et al 2019 also found the lowest concentrations of epss and chlorophyll as the representative of the cyanobacteria biomass in fine grained heavy textured soils as compared to the medium and coarse grained ones on the other hand rozenstein et al 2014 and mugnai et al 2020 found that the cyanobacteria growth can be also limited on coarse grained particle size soils due to the instability of these soils therefore it is possible that either very fine or very coarse soils are not suitable substrates for cyanobacterial growth in the coarse grained particle size soils fairly low nutrient e g carbon and nitrogen contents due to the leaching process could lead to the low mcc and high shc wang et al 2020 along with the use of various amendments the effect of soil inoculation by cyanobacteria on increasing the nutrient content especially carbon and nitrogen in the sand soils has been confirmed kheirfam and roohi 2020 as observed in this study fig 5 nostoc sp and oscillatoria sp cyanobacteria used in this study are known as nitrogen fixing and carbon storing organisms kheirfam et al 2017a peng and bruns 2019 they could convert the atmospheric nitrogen to ammonium or nitrate by their nitrogenase enzymes and the atmospheric carbon dioxide to oxygen and the carbon hydrogen oxygen form of the organic compounds by their photosynthetic capability rossi et al 2015 additionally the epss secretion of the cyanobacteria content represented 9 18 on average 13 1 of the organic carbon chamizo et al 2018 which could significantly increase the soil carbon content in addition to the direct role of inoculated cyanobacteria in nitrogen fixation the rapid increase in soil carbon content could enhance the flux of the ambient nitrogen to the soil to balance the carbon to nitrogen ratio kheirfam et al 2017a although nitrogen fixation and especially carbon sequestration is a time consuming process in ecosystems cyanobacteria dominated biological soil crusts can accelerate these processes kheirfam and roohi 2020 a significant and rapid increase of soil carbon and nitrogen content shortly after the inoculation of cyanobacteria has been reported by acea et al 2003 60 days nisha et al 2007 45 days chamizo et al 2018 90 days kheirfam et al 2017a 38 days and kheirfam 2020 60 days the high nutrient content in the soil surface could lead to improving the soil aggregation ucgul et al 2015 increasing the soil surface water retention capacity sadeghi et al 2020a and reducing the soil shc brevik et al 2006 in addition to the high ability of cyanobacteria to increase the capacity of the soil environment to absorb and retain water they could gradually discharge the water absorbed by their cells due to high external tension heads wang et al 2009 sadeghi et al 2020a therefore they reduce the soil shc especially in the sand soils the shc in the coarse grained soils was high due to their high porosity and poor content of colloidal particles leading to the rapid loss of water from the soil environment meanwhile the inoculation of cyanobacteria into the sand soil surface led to the occupation of the porous space of the soil environment and the mcc increase thus decreasing the shc however the slight development of cyanobacteria and the insufficient space for them to swell could limit the absorption of water by cyanobacterial cells in the clay soil in this regard wang et al 2009 found that the shc had a negative correlation with the cyanobacterial polysaccharide secretions which promoted water retention in the surface layer of the sand soils the increase of water content in the natural cyanobacteria dominated biological soil crusts chamizo et al 2012 and restored degraded soils by the inoculation of cyanobacteria sadeghi et al 2017 and 2020b kheirfam and roohi 2020 has been confirmed however we observed a slight difference in the shc between clay and loam soils this could be due to the small scale experiment the low difference between the bulk density of the clay and loam soils and the simulation of soil textures our findings therefore approved that cyanobacteria could improve the mcc and shc of medium and coarse grained soils however it was not affordable for the fine grained soil due to its negligible impact so the inoculation of cyanobacteria had a positive effect on improving some important physical and chemical properties of all three soil clay loam and sand textures despite the desirable results obtained by this study we should emphasize that the durability functionality and effectiveness of the inoculated cyanobacteria have not yet been investigated under natural conditions thus requiring further research suitable species inoculation time and optimal inoculant biomass should be explored by comprehensive laboratory field studies in this regard moisture limitation desiccation and ultraviolet radiation are known as the major challenges for field scale inoculation cyanobacteria samolov et al 2020 kheirfam et al 2020 resolved these challenges by planning the inoculation time in the wet and temperate seasons i e spring additionally chen et al 2013 suggested the use of uv irradiance resistant cyanobacteria such as nostoc sp as also applied in one of our inoculation options furthermore although laboratory results showed the good impacts of the cyanobacteria inoculation in managing the mcc and shc behavior implementation of the inoculation techniques on a field scale will face several challenges including inoculation tools and its cost effectiveness therefore the use of agricultural aircraft has been introduced as another option for the widspread inoculation of cyanobacteria in large scale projects sears and prithiviraj 2012 on the other hand sadeghi et al 2020a found that the soil inoculation with cyanobacteria usd 350 ha 1 is an economically efficient technique in comparison to the other common amendments including biochar usd 8000 ha 1 polyacrylamides usd 1000 ha 1 and straw mulch usd 750 ha 1 the durability and stability of the artificially formed recovered biological soil crust by cyanobacteria inoculation could be regarded as one of the major challenges chamizo et al 2018 kheirfam and asadzadeh 2020 found that not only the inoculated cyanobacteria had short term effects on improving the soil components but also their impacts persisted for a long time due to the strong structures created by their filaments 5 conclusion a fine grained particle size with poor drainage potential e g clay texture high low mcc shc and a coarse grained particle size with short term water retention e g sand texture low high mcc shc could be regarded as a major challenge for agricultural water management however this can be adjusted if the soil texture is amended our experiment showed that the artificial increase of soil cyanobacteria with the help of the inoculation technique could address the water retention behavior of different soil textures we also found that the soil inoculation method increased the coarse grained particle size soils especially the sand texture and the potential to retain water which could be regarded as a way to reduce the frequency of irrigation in farms our findings also showed that cyanobacteria could increase decrease the mcc shc of the medium and coarse grained soils loam and sand textures therefore this could help to increase the amount and duration of the available moisture in these soils however this may not always contribute to the drainage management of the loam soils despite the promising results obtained for the cyanobacteria inoculation in the coarse grained soils the soil water behavior i e mcc shc of the clay texture soil was not changed thus other strategies and or amendments are required cyanobacteria improved the potential of the coarse grained soils to increase the amount high mcc and duration low shc of water retention in different ways such as secretion of epss development of cyanobacterial filaments in the soil surface layer and the increase of soil nutrients e g carbon and nitrogen enhancing water absorption and retention in the soil although the undesirable texture of agricultural soils could be successfully ameliorated by inoculating cyanobacteria to help the better management of agricultural water further research is needed to find ways to ensure its up scaling defining similar experiments on structurally undisturbed and intact soil samples as well as in field conditions is another of our suggestions for future research funding this
