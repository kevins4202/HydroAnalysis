14730,due to the increasing applications silver nanoparticles agnps are inevitably released into the environments and are subjected to various transformations chloride ion cl is a common and abundant anion with a wide range of concentration in aquatic environments and exhibits a strong affinity for silver the results indicate that agnps experienced multistep chlorination which was dependent on the concentration of cl in a non linear manner the dissolution of agnps was accelerated at cl ag ratio of 1 and the intensive etching effect of cl contributed to the significant morphology changes of agnps the dissolved ag quickly precipitated with cl to form an amorphous and passivating agcl s layer on the surface of agnps thus the dissolution rate of agnps decreased at higher cl ag ratios 100 and 1000 as the cl ag ratio further increased to 10 000 the overall transformation rate increased remarkably due to the complexation of cl with agcl s to form soluble agclx x 1 species which was verified by the reaction of agcl nanoparticles with cl besides several environmental factors electrolytes surfactants and natural organic matter affected agnps dissolution and the following chlorination these results will expand the understanding of the environmental fate and potential risks of agnps in natural chloride rich waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords silver nanoparticles agnps silver chloride agcl dissolution chlorination morphology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent decades silver nanoparticles agnps are extensively used in various industries due to the outstanding antimicrobial and catalytic properties hansen et al 2020 mo et al 2022 sharma et al 2021 zhou et al 2018a the widespread applications of agnps lead to their inevitable release into the natural environments and their potential risks have received much attention hou et al 2017 tan et al 2023 zhao et al 2021c agnps are widely present in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and natural aquatic environments especially surface water and freshwater sanchis et al 2020 xiao et al 2019 zhao et al 2021b the predicted environmental concentration of agnps is at μg l 1 and even mg l 1 in waters wang et al 2022 and the observed concentration was reported to be 0 1 20 mg l 1 in malaysian rivers and sewage treatment plants syafiuddin et al 2018 due to the low redox potential and high surface area agnps are subjected to various transformations and interact with environmental components actively which eventually affect their bioavailability and potential toxicities le ouay and stellacci 2015 mbanga et al 2022 tan et al 2023 wang and liu 2022 zhao et al 2021c chlorination is one of the most important transformations of agnps and typically refers to the interactions with chloride ion one of the most prevalent anions in natural aquatic environments wimmer et al 2020 yin et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a zhao et al 2021c in a chloride rich environment e g marine sediment and wastewater effluent chlorination of agnps is expected and agcl s is observed as the predominant transformation product hong et al 2021 thalmann et al 2015 wang et al 2014 different from the direct sulfidation route of agnps chlorination of agnps takes place in two consecutive steps oxidative dissolution of agnps leads to the release of free ag ions followed by precipitation with cl zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021c during this process due to the superior etching capacity the presence of cl might change the morphology of agnps which would affect its stability and reactivity guo et al 2021a zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 although cl has been often employed as a specific agent to regulate the growth process and final morphology during the synthesis of silver nanomaterials this has not been well recognized in the transformation of agnps in natural aquatic environment fargašová et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 because of the quick reaction between ag and cl as well as the low solubility of agcl k sp 1 77 10 10 a passivating agcl s surface layer may form on the surface of agnps after exposure in physiological and gastrointestinal fluids which depresses the further release of ag ions and the overall dissolution axson et al 2015 gorka et al 2019 wu et al 2018 however recent studies observed increased dissolution rate of agnps as the salinity of seawater or wastewater increased which was due to the formation of soluble agclx x 1 x 2 3 4 species cervantes avilés et al 2019 toncelli et al 2017 wimmer et al 2020 similar to the dissolved ag ions these dissolvable silver chloride complexes are also considered to be biologically active and account for the hazardous effect of agnps at high concentrations of cl chambers et al 2014 gorka et al 2019 xiao et al 2021 these results imply that chlorination of agnps might experience multistep processes including dissolution into ag ions precipitation with cl to form agcl s further transformation of agcl s into dissolved agclx x 1 noteworthily the ambient concentration of cl in the natural aquatic environments spans a large range from several hundreds of μg l 1 to thousands of mg l 1 which makes the cl ag ratio as one of the most determinant factors in the transformation of agnps astorg et al 2022 dugan et al 2020 as previously manifested by levard et al the colloidal stability of agnps and the concentration of the released ions during agnps dissolution exhibited a strong dependence on the cl ag ratios levard et al 2013 however a comprehensive consideration of the multistep chlorination processes and the regulatory role of cl in the morphology changes of agnps have not been adequately addressed as a function of cl ag molar ratios in aquatic environments various environmental factors might exert influence on the chloride induced transformations of agnps in aquatic environments cervantes avilés et al 2019 wang and liu 2022 zhang et al 2018a previous studies have found that accompanied by cl light irradiation could greatly affect the generation of reactive oxygen species by citrate coated agnps and the water chemistry conditions e g ionic strength and suspended sediment would simultaneously mediate the colloidal stability and dissolution of agnps chambers et al 2014 li et al 2018b zhao et al 2021a the interactive effects of various environmental factors such as electrolytes surfactants and natural organic matter nom on the transformations of agnps in the presence of cl also warrant further understanding chloride ions are present in freshwater naturally with a gradient concentration ranging from 0 27 to 1400 mg l 1 equivalently 0 01 39 4 mm astorg et al 2022 dugan et al 2020 mackie et al 2022 and is also enriched in sewage effluent and wastewater in wwtps 30 300 mg l 1 equivalently 0 85 8 5 mm cervantes avilés et al 2019 cooper et al 2022 lubello et al 2004 therefore in this study various cl concentrations 0 01 100 mm typically representative of the freshwater and wwtps where agnps are usually detected were selected to clarify the multiple transformation processes of agnps and intrinsic mechanisms at various cl ag ratios the transformation kinetics were monitored and the transformed solid products were characterized in detail moreover the effects of environmental factors including electrolytes surfactants and nom on the chloride induced transformations of agnps were investigated the results could enhance the understanding of agnps transformation processes and mechanisms in aquatic environments and facilitate to assess the environmental fate and risks of agnps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents sodium chloride nacl 99 99 was purchased from aladdin chemistry co ltd and other chemicals and reagents were listed in the supporting information si ultrapure water milli q millipore usa with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm 1 was used for the whole study agnps coated by polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp were synthesized as detailed in our previous studies and si yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 during the synthesis 0 3 g of pvp was added to stabilize the agnps 1 mm 2 2 agnps chlorination experiments the chlorination experiments of agnps were performed on a rotating incubator at room temperature and the freshly prepared nacl solution was used as the chloride source the predetermined volumes of agnps and nacl were added to each test tube with screw cap and then ultrapure water was added to make up the reaction solution to 10 ml the ph of the reaction solutions measured by a ph meter mettler toledo switzerland maintained constant at around 7 1 0 1 and 6 8 0 2 in the absence and presence of cl during the 120 h experiment at each preselected reaction time point one tube was sacrificed to obtain uv vis absorption spectra from 200 to 800 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer u3900h hitachi japan the concentration of total transformed ag dissolved ag species and agcl was quantified following the reported method with minor modifications guo et al 2021b yin et al 2017 in brief each sample was divided into two portions of equal volume one of them was subjected to ultracentrifugation amicon ultra 15 3 kda millipore usa at 6000 g for 30 min at 4 c to separate the dissolved ag species from silver containing nanoparticles the filtrate was acidified using 0 3 ml of 65 hno3 and the concentration of dissolved ag species was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms elan drc e perkinelmer usa in the other portion triton x 114 0 1 w v was added to serve as a coating agent which prevents the dissolution of agnps followed by the addition of na2s2o3 20 mm to dissolve agcl s during the extraction process the dissolution of agnps was negligible chao et al 2011 guo et al 2021b the suspension was shaken at 200 rpm for 15 min at 40 c followed by centrifugation to accelerate the phase separation and all the forms of ag dissolved ag species and ag dissolved from agcl by na2s2o3 complexed with s2o3 2 which refers to the total transformed ag concentration the concentration of agcl was calculated by the difference between the two portions and the recovery rate was 97 3 5 7 all the agnps chlorination experiments 1 and 10 μm were conducted at least three times to confirm reproducibility various cl concentrations 0 01 0 1 1 10 100 mm were selected to obtain different cl ag ratios dissolved oxygen do was reported to strongly impact the transformation and fate of agnps in aquatic environments liu and hurt 2010 wang and liu 2022 however its impacts on the chlorination of agnps are yet unknown therefore chlorination of agnps with cl ag ratios at 1 100 and 10000 was conducted to further figure out the role of do for this purpose the reaction solutions were purged with high purity nitrogen for 1 h before reaction consequently the do decreased significantly from 9 9 to 0 2 mg l 1 which are representative of the typical freshwater in the range of 5 to 12 95 mg l 1 and hypoxia conditions do 1 mg l 1 respectively xue et al 2023 zhang et al 2022a zhang et al 2022b all other procedures were conducted as the same as described above 2 3 dissolution kinetics of silver chloride nanoparticles agcl nps to understand the role of produced agcl by chlorination on the surface of agnps agcl nps was prepared according to a previous method with minor modifications and is described in the si hong et al 2021 khan et al 2021 the dissolution kinetics of agcl nps were measured in the presence of cl at different concentrations 0 1 10 and 100 mm samples were withdrawn at the preselected time points and the dissolved ag species were separated from agcl nps by ultracentrifugation amicon ultra 15 3 kda at 6000 g for 30 min at 4 c the filtrate was acidified using concentrated nitric acid and the concentrations of dissolved ag species were measured by icp ms as described above 2 4 effects of environmental factors to investigate the effects of environmental factors on the transformation of agnps different electrolytes surfactants and nom were added into the agnps cl complex solution under environmentally relevant conditions given most freshwater lakes have low cl concentrations typically 20 mg l 1 500 μm dugan et al 2020 hintz et al 2022 the concentrations of agnps and cl were selected at 10 and 100 μm respectively effects of electrolytes electrolytes are ubiquitous in the natural waters and could greatly influence the stability of agnps mbanga et al 2022 zhang et al 2016 the most prevalent electrolyte components of natural freshwaters namely nano3 kno3 mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 at 3 mm were added in the reaction solution respectively to explore their effects effects of surfactants surfactants were reported to be frequently detected in the natural waters with the concentration ranging from 0 001 to 10 mg l 1 and might affect both the water chemistry and properties of agnps zhang et al 2018b zhu et al 2020 cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds were chosen to investigate the effects of surfactants on the transformation of agnps given that br ions in ctab may react with ag ions cetyltrimethylammonium nitrate ctan was prepared by reacting ctab with agno3 following the method described in our previous study zhang et al 2018b the concentrations of two different surfactants ctan and sds applied here were 3 μm effects of nom nom is widely present in aquatic environments at concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 50 mg l 1 and may interact with agnps to form complexes azodi et al 2016 wang et al 2022 humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa are typically model nom and therefore were selected to explore their effects 5 mg l 1 on the transformation of agnps in the presence of cl 2 5 characterization of the prepared and transformed products the pristine and transformed samples were lyophilized for further characterization the crystal structures were obtained through x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance bruker germany with by cu kα radiation with 5 min 1 from 5 to 90 the morphological characteristics were observed by transmission electronic microscopy tem and high resolution tem hrtem with the operating voltage at 200 kv talos f200x fei usa the samples were prepared on a carbon coated copper grid and the elemental mapping was obtained by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx the transformed products were further analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher usa with a monochromatized al kα x radiation source 1486 6 ev and the binding energy values were calibrated by c 1s 284 8 ev the changes in zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter of agnps were measured using a zetasizer analyzer nano zs90 malvern uk statistical analyses were performed using r version 4 0 2 and mann whitney wilcoxon test was performed to evaluate the significant differences 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorination of agnps at various cl ag ratios in the presence of cl at various concentrations in this study the agnps were well dispersed in the solutions without significant aggregation fig s1 which was consistent with the reported critical coagulation concentration in nacl 111 5 mm huynh and chen 2011 uv vis absorption spectra were collected over time to qualitatively investigate the effects of cl ag ratios on the transformation of agnps as shown in fig s2a in the absence of cl the absorbance peak at 410 nm decreased slightly due to the slow oxidative dissolution of agnps in water when cl was added at cl ag 1 the surface plasmon resonance spr peak red shifted and became broader obviously fig s2b which might be attributed to the irregular changes in morphology and particle size cathcart and kitaev 2011 guo et al 2021a karade et al 2021 similar phenomenon was also observed in fig s2c when cl ag was at 10 however the absorption peak at higher cl concentrations cl ag 100 and 1000 was similar to the pristine agnps until 120 h fig s2d and e indicating the morphology of agnps did not change distinctly at cl ag 10 000 the blue shifted absorption peak narrowed significantly and the intensity gradually decreased over time fig s2f suggesting both the particle size and concentration of agnps decreased it was reported that the chloride concentration played a more important role than the ionic strength in the dissolution of agnps chambers et al 2014 thus it is suggested that the above observations were attributed to the large difference in the cl concentrations similarly as shown in fig 1 the characteristic absorption peaks of agnps 1 μm decreased obviously in the presence of 0 01 mm cl while slightly in the presence of 0 1 mm cl notably as the concentration of cl increased to 1 and 10 mm the peaks at around 265 nm verified the formation of agcl nps guo et al 2021b which gradually disappeared as time prolonged when the concentration of cl increased to 100 mm the significant decrease and blue shift of the characteristic peak occurred simultaneously as predicted by the thermodynamics based on medusa and minteq simulations fig s3a and b the equilibrium distributions and predominant ag species changed distinctly as the cl ag ratio increased in the presence of cl ions agnps would transform to various products such as ag agcl and agclx x 1 species and therefore the total concentrations of the dissolved ag species and agcl were determined to quantitatively investigate the effects of cl ag ratio on the transformation kinetics of agnps as shown in fig 2 a and s4a a total of 9 1 4 2 9 5 10 2 and 30 7 of the original agnps were transformed after 120 h reaction when the ratio of cl ag was at 1 10 100 1000 and 10000 respectively which were all significantly higher than that of agnps in the absence of cl 0 9 the experimental data were further fitted by the first order rate law d a g d t k a g where ag represents the total concentration of transformed ag dissolved ag species and agcl at the reaction time t h and k h 1 represents the transformation rate constant of agnps as shown in fig 2b and table s1 agnps underwent dissolution at a rate of 0 0019 0 0003 h 1 in the absence of cl the transformation rate of agnps 0 0114 0 0023 h 1 was significantly accelerated when the cl ag ratio was 1 probably due to the intensively oxidative etching kent and vikesland 2012 yang et al 2007 as the cl ag ratio increased to 10 both the k value 0 0032 0 0003 h 1 and transformation percentage decreased distinctly however as the cl ag molar ratio increased to 100 and 1000 transformation percentage 9 5 10 2 and the rate constant 0 0074 0 0005 and 0 0077 0 0009 h 1 respectively all increased relative to the group of 10 1 cl ag more notably both of k 0 0252 0 0028 h 1 and transformation percentage increased substantially at cl ag 10 000 suggesting the significantly facilitated transformation of agnps chlorination of agnps was also conducted at 1 μm in the presence of cl at different concentrations 0 01 100 mm as shown in fig 2c and s4b agnps underwent transformation at rates of 0 0011 0 0001 0 0027 0 0001 0 0018 0 0002 0 0017 0 0001 0 0020 0 0001 0 0051 0 0003 h 1 in the presence of cl at concentrations of 0 0 01 0 1 1 10 and 100 mm respectively combining the results together we found that the transformation of agnps was dependent on the cl concentration but not monotonically implying that multiple transformation processes took place at various cl concentrations 3 2 chlorination mechanism of agnps 3 2 1 changes in the morphology of agnps as shown in fig 3 a agnps maintained the spherical shape in the absence of cl when the cl ag ratio was 1 polygonal nanoparticles with uneven sizes and rough surface were observed fig 3b these irregular transformation products were surrounded by some small particles which was probably caused by the etching effect of cl kent and vikesland 2012 wiley et al 2004 yang et al 2007 the dissolved ag reacted with cl to produce agcl s and the lattice fringe spacing in hrtem image matched well with chlorargyrite jcpds no 01 085 1355 fig 3g similar morphology changes were also observed at the cl ag ratio of 10 fig 3c due to the apparent morphology changes by intensive cl etching the particle size distribution became polydisperse fig s5 however the spherical agnps barely changed at cl ag 100 fig 3d which was in line with the marginal change in the uv vis absorption spectra fig s2d a thick layer 1 5 5 nm was obvious near the edge of the agnps which might be attributed to the formation of amorphous agcl s when cl ag was 1000 the size of the nps decreased slightly and the amorphous layer became thinner suggesting that the formed agcl s started to dissolve at this ratio fig 3e the hydrodynamic diameter also tended to decrease as the time prolonged and the difference became significant p 0 05 after 120 h fig s5 noteworthily at cl ag 10 000 although the nps still kept spherical morphology the particle size decreased significantly and the external agcl layer disappeared fig 3f indicating that the formed agcl s completely dissolved which then facilitated the dissolution of agnps by high concentration of chloride ions the tem edx mapping verifiably showed that silver and chloride elements overlapped on the surface of nps fig 4 a which was in line with the formation of amorphous agcl s on the surface fig 3d as the concentration of cl increased the cl element only covered a portion of the surface of agnps fig 4b and c confirming that the agcl s layer started to dissolve and became less dense the further transformation of agcl s to agclx x 1 led to the obvious decrease in the size of nps moreover xps was conducted to further examine the oxidation state of elements and the surface compositions of the chlorinated products as shown in fig s6a the high resolution xps spectra in the ag 3d region of the original agnps exhibited two peaks at binding energies of 367 3 and 373 3 ev corresponding to ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 peaks of metallic ag respectively turco et al 2018 zhou et al 2018a during chlorination the peaks at 368 3 and 374 3 ev fig s6a verified the formation of monovalent ag and the peaks at 198 2 and 199 9 ev fig s6b were ascribed to cl 2p3 2 and cl 2p1 2 respectively confirming the precipitation of agcl s on the surface of agnps thota et al 2022 turco et al 2018 the higher binding energy 530 7 ev of o 1s than that of silver oxide 528 6 ev indicated the negligible formation of silver oxide zhang et al 2016 besides the binding energies of c 1s n 1s and o 1s were similar to those of the original agnps fig s6c suggesting the pvp coating was still on the surface of agnps in the presence of cl at less than 1 mm chloride ions could diffuse through pvp coating and chlorination occurred on the surface of agnps 3 2 2 multistep chlorination mechanism the possible transformation processes involved in the chlorination of agnps are listed below 1 2 a g 0 1 2 o 2 2 h 2 a g h 2 o 2 a g c l a g c l 3 a g c l x 1 c l a g c l x x 1 x 2 3 4 given that oxidative dissolution of agnps is strongly mediated by do the role of do was further investigated in the presence of cl as shown in fig s7 and 5a when do decreased to 0 2 mg l 1 agnps underwent transformation at a slower rate of 0 0026 0 0005 and 0 0015 0 0004 h 1 at cl ag 1 and 100 respectively the removal of do from the solutions resulted in an obvious decrease in the transformation percentage indicating that oxygen had an important effect on the dissolution of agnps and the etching by cl however higher concentration of cl cl ag 10 000 led to the comparable transformed percentage and rate 0 0198 0 0017 h 1 after the removal of do fig s7c implying that the impact of cl overwhelmed that of do at higher cl concentration the above results suggested that the formation of agcl s layer on the surface of agnps played a critical role in further transformation of agnps to unveil the effect of cl on the following transformation agcl nps were prepared and the dissolution of agcl nps 1 μm was investigated the representative uv vis absorption peak at 262 nm and xrd pattern signified the pure agcl nps which had a regular size distribution around 20 nm fig s8 guo et al 2021b khan et al 2021 as shown in fig 5 b at the cl agcl molar ratios of 1000 and 10 000 there was marginal impact of cl on the dissolution of agcl nps however as the concentration of cl increased to a ratio of cl agcl 100 000 the dissolution of agcl nps was significantly promoted 0 0660 0 0148 h 1 due to formation of ag cl complexes agclx x 1 reaction 3 rong et al 2018 this observation verified the significantly accelerated transformation rate of agnps at cl ag 10 000 0 0252 0 0028 h 1 which was evidenced by the distinctly increased concentration of dissolved ag species fig s4a cervantes avilés et al 2019 mbanga et al 2022 it is worth to note that do had a negligible effect on the dissolution of agcl nps at high concentration of cl verifying the high concentration of cl overwhelmed the role of do in the dissolution of agcl s layer and core agnps the transformed products were further analyzed by xrd and the changes in the relative intensity ratios between facets are shown in fig 5c owing to the selective adsorption of pvp to ag 100 facets the synthesized agnps were enriched with ag 111 facets gan et al 2015 le ouay and stellacci 2015 cl ions were reported to adsorb preferentially onto the ag 111 facets which could readily react with oxygen molecule and dissolve li et al 2014 therefore due to the selective oxidative etching by cl the relative intensity ratios of 111 200 and 111 220 diffraction peaks of agnps decreased significantly p 0 01 at cl ag 1 compared with the original agnps which was consistent with the occurrence of irregular morphologies with sharp corners and edges in fig 3b zhou et al 2016 meanwhile the zeta potentials of agnps were measured over transformation time and the results are shown in fig 5d the zeta potential of agnps increased from 37 4 1 3 to 25 3 2 3 mv in the absence of cl when the cl ag ratio was 1 and 10 the zeta potential also tended to increase from 36 2 1 2 to 20 9 0 9 mv and from 29 9 1 5 mv to 25 9 2 9 mv respectively largely due to the adsorption of the dissolved ag onto the surface of nps li et al 2014 zhao et al 2021a additionally the smaller size of cl ion than the polymer chain of pvp makes cl easier to diffuse through the pvp coating and reach the surface of agnps zhou et al 2016 zhou et al 2018b the zeta potential of agnps changed slightly at the cl ag ratio of 100 suggesting the consumption of cl and gradual production of agcl s levard et al 2013 rong et al 2018 notably the relative intensity ratios of 111 200 and 111 220 diffraction peaks of agnps showed no significance difference from the control group p 0 05 confirming that the precipitation of agcl s layer covered the surface of agnps and retarded the dissolution of inner agnps li et al 2014 li et al 2018b zhang et al 2022c owing to the gradual dissolution of outer agcl s layer to agclx x 1 the relative intensity ratios of 111 200 and 111 220 diffraction peaks of agnps tended to decrease as the cl ag ratio increased to 1000 a significant decrease p 0 01 in both intensity ratios was observed when the cl ag ratio was 10 000 verifying the subsequent dissolution of inner agnps accompanied by the disappearance of outer agcl s layer fig 3f levard et al 2013 li et al 2018b the above results fortified a strongly concentration dependent effect of cl on the chlorination of agnps and the multiple transformation processes could be concluded as following i when cl ag was 1 agnps transformation was promoted due to the intensive etching by cl ii as the concentration of cl increased precipitation of agcl s formed on the surface of agnps which acted as a barrier to protect the core agnps from further dissolution thus leading to the decreased dissolution rate of agnps iii at higher cl ag molar ratio 10000 the agcl s protection layer tended to dissolve rapidly due to the formation of soluble agclx x 1 species which subsequently promoted the dissolution of the inner agnps 3 3 impacts of environmental factors 3 3 1 effect of electrolytes as shown in fig 6a and s9a the facilitated transformation of agnps in the presence of electrolyte was observed and the promotion effect of divalent cations mg2 and ca2 was stronger than that of monovalent cations na and k this was consistent with the enhanced dissolution of agnps with an increase in ionic strength reported previously huang et al 2020 wang et al 2019 noteworthily the concentrations of the dissolved ag species in divalent cations after 120 h 0 40 0 05 and 0 34 0 03 μm in mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 respectively were significantly higher p 0 05 than that in water 0 18 0 01 μm or in monovalent cations 0 21 0 04 and 0 21 0 03 μm in nano3 and kno3 respectively while the concentration of agcl s was not statistically significant the speciation diagrams created in minteq fig s3c may help to understand the compositions of ag species in different electrolyte types ag ions account for 21 8 21 8 23 7 and 23 6 in the presence of 3 mm nano3 kno3 mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 respectively which were higher than that in water 19 8 while agcl s exhibited an opposite trend the addition of electrolytes increased the total concentrations of ions in the mixture solutions thus depressed the combination of ag with cl and ultimately increased the solubility of agcl s via salt in effect as a result the experimental and theoretical results consistently indicated that electrolytes especially with higher valences could substantially promote agnps dissolution by suppressing the formation of agcl s 3 3 2 effect of surfactants as shown in fig 6b and s9b ctan promoted the transformation rate of agnps while sds did not affect the transformation distinctly the characteristic peak of agnps in the uv vis absorption spectra decreased rapidly and broadened obviously in the presence of ctan while a marginal decline was observed in sds fig s10a b the corroded nanoparticles surrounded the initial agnps in the presence of ctan fig s10c and the diffraction peaks 111 200 intensity ratio of agnps decreased from 3 5 to 2 8 fig s11a as reported in our previous study the cationic surfactant ctan preferred to bind with the ag 111 facet and promoted corrosion of the initial nanostructure thus accelerated the dissolution of agnps zhang et al 2018b in contrast sds did not distinctly change the colloidal stability neither the diffraction peaks 111 200 intensity ratio 3 3 of agnps consequently sds exhibited negligible effect on the dissolution of agnps as shown in fig s11b after 120 h transformation in the presence of cl the generated amount of agcl s accounted for 5 3 5 5 and 8 3 in water sds and ctan respectively verifying the chlorination of agnps was also promoted by ctan 3 3 3 effect of nom fig s12a and b compared the changes of the absorption peaks of agnps in the presence of ha or fa with the control group fig s2c based on the first order rate law the transformation rate of agnps were 0 0023 0 0003 and 0 0025 0 0004 h 1 in the presence of ha and fa fig 6c and s9c respectively which were slower than that without nom 0 0032 0 0003 h 1 p 0 05 indicating that both ha and fa inhibited the chlorination of agnps the binding affinity between nom and agnps was further investigated by the fluorescence quenching experiments as presented in fig s12c and d after the addition of agnps the fluorescence intensities of ha excitation emission 335 420 nm and fa excitation emission 265 410 nm decreased by 31 3 and 21 6 respectively suggesting strong interaction was formed between nom and agnps which could lead to the formation of nom corona on the surface of agnps li et al 2018a tan et al 2023 in the absence of cl the dissolution percentage of agnps was 2 4 and 3 5 with the addition of ha and fa after 120 h reaction respectively which was distinctly lower than that of control 9 1 indicating that formation of nom corona inhibited the dissolution of agnps as reported previously ha and fa adsorbed on the surface of agnps and blocked the active sites for oxidation of agnps azodi et al 2016 li et al 2018a thus inhibiting the dissolution of agnps the decreased concentration of the released ag would lead to the subsequent inhibited chlorination these results highlighted the importance of environmental factors on the chloride induced transformations of agnps 4 conclusions the present study demonstrated that the ubiquitous inorganic ligand cl played a critical role in the chemical transformation and morphology changes of agnps which were strongly dependent on the cl ag molar ratios the co present environmental constituents could affect the dissolution of agnps followed by the interaction with cl the multistep transformation processes would lead to the formation of different transformed products such as ag nps with a stabilizing agcl s shell or soluble agclx x 1 which result in the distinct potential risks and toxic mechanisms of agnps the results of this study provide more comprehensive information on evaluating the transformations of agnps in natural chloride rich waters such as freshwater ecosystems the concentration of cl at sub mm level and seawater with a cl ag ratio higher than 105 besides the interactive effect of chloride with other environmental components was essential to understand the ultimate fate of agnps under realistic environmental

14730,due to the increasing applications silver nanoparticles agnps are inevitably released into the environments and are subjected to various transformations chloride ion cl is a common and abundant anion with a wide range of concentration in aquatic environments and exhibits a strong affinity for silver the results indicate that agnps experienced multistep chlorination which was dependent on the concentration of cl in a non linear manner the dissolution of agnps was accelerated at cl ag ratio of 1 and the intensive etching effect of cl contributed to the significant morphology changes of agnps the dissolved ag quickly precipitated with cl to form an amorphous and passivating agcl s layer on the surface of agnps thus the dissolution rate of agnps decreased at higher cl ag ratios 100 and 1000 as the cl ag ratio further increased to 10 000 the overall transformation rate increased remarkably due to the complexation of cl with agcl s to form soluble agclx x 1 species which was verified by the reaction of agcl nanoparticles with cl besides several environmental factors electrolytes surfactants and natural organic matter affected agnps dissolution and the following chlorination these results will expand the understanding of the environmental fate and potential risks of agnps in natural chloride rich waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords silver nanoparticles agnps silver chloride agcl dissolution chlorination morphology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent decades silver nanoparticles agnps are extensively used in various industries due to the outstanding antimicrobial and catalytic properties hansen et al 2020 mo et al 2022 sharma et al 2021 zhou et al 2018a the widespread applications of agnps lead to their inevitable release into the natural environments and their potential risks have received much attention hou et al 2017 tan et al 2023 zhao et al 2021c agnps are widely present in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and natural aquatic environments especially surface water and freshwater sanchis et al 2020 xiao et al 2019 zhao et al 2021b the predicted environmental concentration of agnps is at μg l 1 and even mg l 1 in waters wang et al 2022 and the observed concentration was reported to be 0 1 20 mg l 1 in malaysian rivers and sewage treatment plants syafiuddin et al 2018 due to the low redox potential and high surface area agnps are subjected to various transformations and interact with environmental components actively which eventually affect their bioavailability and potential toxicities le ouay and stellacci 2015 mbanga et al 2022 tan et al 2023 wang and liu 2022 zhao et al 2021c chlorination is one of the most important transformations of agnps and typically refers to the interactions with chloride ion one of the most prevalent anions in natural aquatic environments wimmer et al 2020 yin et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a zhao et al 2021c in a chloride rich environment e g marine sediment and wastewater effluent chlorination of agnps is expected and agcl s is observed as the predominant transformation product hong et al 2021 thalmann et al 2015 wang et al 2014 different from the direct sulfidation route of agnps chlorination of agnps takes place in two consecutive steps oxidative dissolution of agnps leads to the release of free ag ions followed by precipitation with cl zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021c during this process due to the superior etching capacity the presence of cl might change the morphology of agnps which would affect its stability and reactivity guo et al 2021a zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 although cl has been often employed as a specific agent to regulate the growth process and final morphology during the synthesis of silver nanomaterials this has not been well recognized in the transformation of agnps in natural aquatic environment fargašová et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 because of the quick reaction between ag and cl as well as the low solubility of agcl k sp 1 77 10 10 a passivating agcl s surface layer may form on the surface of agnps after exposure in physiological and gastrointestinal fluids which depresses the further release of ag ions and the overall dissolution axson et al 2015 gorka et al 2019 wu et al 2018 however recent studies observed increased dissolution rate of agnps as the salinity of seawater or wastewater increased which was due to the formation of soluble agclx x 1 x 2 3 4 species cervantes avilés et al 2019 toncelli et al 2017 wimmer et al 2020 similar to the dissolved ag ions these dissolvable silver chloride complexes are also considered to be biologically active and account for the hazardous effect of agnps at high concentrations of cl chambers et al 2014 gorka et al 2019 xiao et al 2021 these results imply that chlorination of agnps might experience multistep processes including dissolution into ag ions precipitation with cl to form agcl s further transformation of agcl s into dissolved agclx x 1 noteworthily the ambient concentration of cl in the natural aquatic environments spans a large range from several hundreds of μg l 1 to thousands of mg l 1 which makes the cl ag ratio as one of the most determinant factors in the transformation of agnps astorg et al 2022 dugan et al 2020 as previously manifested by levard et al the colloidal stability of agnps and the concentration of the released ions during agnps dissolution exhibited a strong dependence on the cl ag ratios levard et al 2013 however a comprehensive consideration of the multistep chlorination processes and the regulatory role of cl in the morphology changes of agnps have not been adequately addressed as a function of cl ag molar ratios in aquatic environments various environmental factors might exert influence on the chloride induced transformations of agnps in aquatic environments cervantes avilés et al 2019 wang and liu 2022 zhang et al 2018a previous studies have found that accompanied by cl light irradiation could greatly affect the generation of reactive oxygen species by citrate coated agnps and the water chemistry conditions e g ionic strength and suspended sediment would simultaneously mediate the colloidal stability and dissolution of agnps chambers et al 2014 li et al 2018b zhao et al 2021a the interactive effects of various environmental factors such as electrolytes surfactants and natural organic matter nom on the transformations of agnps in the presence of cl also warrant further understanding chloride ions are present in freshwater naturally with a gradient concentration ranging from 0 27 to 1400 mg l 1 equivalently 0 01 39 4 mm astorg et al 2022 dugan et al 2020 mackie et al 2022 and is also enriched in sewage effluent and wastewater in wwtps 30 300 mg l 1 equivalently 0 85 8 5 mm cervantes avilés et al 2019 cooper et al 2022 lubello et al 2004 therefore in this study various cl concentrations 0 01 100 mm typically representative of the freshwater and wwtps where agnps are usually detected were selected to clarify the multiple transformation processes of agnps and intrinsic mechanisms at various cl ag ratios the transformation kinetics were monitored and the transformed solid products were characterized in detail moreover the effects of environmental factors including electrolytes surfactants and nom on the chloride induced transformations of agnps were investigated the results could enhance the understanding of agnps transformation processes and mechanisms in aquatic environments and facilitate to assess the environmental fate and risks of agnps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents sodium chloride nacl 99 99 was purchased from aladdin chemistry co ltd and other chemicals and reagents were listed in the supporting information si ultrapure water milli q millipore usa with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm 1 was used for the whole study agnps coated by polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp were synthesized as detailed in our previous studies and si yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 during the synthesis 0 3 g of pvp was added to stabilize the agnps 1 mm 2 2 agnps chlorination experiments the chlorination experiments of agnps were performed on a rotating incubator at room temperature and the freshly prepared nacl solution was used as the chloride source the predetermined volumes of agnps and nacl were added to each test tube with screw cap and then ultrapure water was added to make up the reaction solution to 10 ml the ph of the reaction solutions measured by a ph meter mettler toledo switzerland maintained constant at around 7 1 0 1 and 6 8 0 2 in the absence and presence of cl during the 120 h experiment at each preselected reaction time point one tube was sacrificed to obtain uv vis absorption spectra from 200 to 800 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer u3900h hitachi japan the concentration of total transformed ag dissolved ag species and agcl was quantified following the reported method with minor modifications guo et al 2021b yin et al 2017 in brief each sample was divided into two portions of equal volume one of them was subjected to ultracentrifugation amicon ultra 15 3 kda millipore usa at 6000 g for 30 min at 4 c to separate the dissolved ag species from silver containing nanoparticles the filtrate was acidified using 0 3 ml of 65 hno3 and the concentration of dissolved ag species was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms elan drc e perkinelmer usa in the other portion triton x 114 0 1 w v was added to serve as a coating agent which prevents the dissolution of agnps followed by the addition of na2s2o3 20 mm to dissolve agcl s during the extraction process the dissolution of agnps was negligible chao et al 2011 guo et al 2021b the suspension was shaken at 200 rpm for 15 min at 40 c followed by centrifugation to accelerate the phase separation and all the forms of ag dissolved ag species and ag dissolved from agcl by na2s2o3 complexed with s2o3 2 which refers to the total transformed ag concentration the concentration of agcl was calculated by the difference between the two portions and the recovery rate was 97 3 5 7 all the agnps chlorination experiments 1 and 10 μm were conducted at least three times to confirm reproducibility various cl concentrations 0 01 0 1 1 10 100 mm were selected to obtain different cl ag ratios dissolved oxygen do was reported to strongly impact the transformation and fate of agnps in aquatic environments liu and hurt 2010 wang and liu 2022 however its impacts on the chlorination of agnps are yet unknown therefore chlorination of agnps with cl ag ratios at 1 100 and 10000 was conducted to further figure out the role of do for this purpose the reaction solutions were purged with high purity nitrogen for 1 h before reaction consequently the do decreased significantly from 9 9 to 0 2 mg l 1 which are representative of the typical freshwater in the range of 5 to 12 95 mg l 1 and hypoxia conditions do 1 mg l 1 respectively xue et al 2023 zhang et al 2022a zhang et al 2022b all other procedures were conducted as the same as described above 2 3 dissolution kinetics of silver chloride nanoparticles agcl nps to understand the role of produced agcl by chlorination on the surface of agnps agcl nps was prepared according to a previous method with minor modifications and is described in the si hong et al 2021 khan et al 2021 the dissolution kinetics of agcl nps were measured in the presence of cl at different concentrations 0 1 10 and 100 mm samples were withdrawn at the preselected time points and the dissolved ag species were separated from agcl nps by ultracentrifugation amicon ultra 15 3 kda at 6000 g for 30 min at 4 c the filtrate was acidified using concentrated nitric acid and the concentrations of dissolved ag species were measured by icp ms as described above 2 4 effects of environmental factors to investigate the effects of environmental factors on the transformation of agnps different electrolytes surfactants and nom were added into the agnps cl complex solution under environmentally relevant conditions given most freshwater lakes have low cl concentrations typically 20 mg l 1 500 μm dugan et al 2020 hintz et al 2022 the concentrations of agnps and cl were selected at 10 and 100 μm respectively effects of electrolytes electrolytes are ubiquitous in the natural waters and could greatly influence the stability of agnps mbanga et al 2022 zhang et al 2016 the most prevalent electrolyte components of natural freshwaters namely nano3 kno3 mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 at 3 mm were added in the reaction solution respectively to explore their effects effects of surfactants surfactants were reported to be frequently detected in the natural waters with the concentration ranging from 0 001 to 10 mg l 1 and might affect both the water chemistry and properties of agnps zhang et al 2018b zhu et al 2020 cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds were chosen to investigate the effects of surfactants on the transformation of agnps given that br ions in ctab may react with ag ions cetyltrimethylammonium nitrate ctan was prepared by reacting ctab with agno3 following the method described in our previous study zhang et al 2018b the concentrations of two different surfactants ctan and sds applied here were 3 μm effects of nom nom is widely present in aquatic environments at concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 50 mg l 1 and may interact with agnps to form complexes azodi et al 2016 wang et al 2022 humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa are typically model nom and therefore were selected to explore their effects 5 mg l 1 on the transformation of agnps in the presence of cl 2 5 characterization of the prepared and transformed products the pristine and transformed samples were lyophilized for further characterization the crystal structures were obtained through x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance bruker germany with by cu kα radiation with 5 min 1 from 5 to 90 the morphological characteristics were observed by transmission electronic microscopy tem and high resolution tem hrtem with the operating voltage at 200 kv talos f200x fei usa the samples were prepared on a carbon coated copper grid and the elemental mapping was obtained by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx the transformed products were further analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher usa with a monochromatized al kα x radiation source 1486 6 ev and the binding energy values were calibrated by c 1s 284 8 ev the changes in zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter of agnps were measured using a zetasizer analyzer nano zs90 malvern uk statistical analyses were performed using r version 4 0 2 and mann whitney wilcoxon test was performed to evaluate the significant differences 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorination of agnps at various cl ag ratios in the presence of cl at various concentrations in this study the agnps were well dispersed in the solutions without significant aggregation fig s1 which was consistent with the reported critical coagulation concentration in nacl 111 5 mm huynh and chen 2011 uv vis absorption spectra were collected over time to qualitatively investigate the effects of cl ag ratios on the transformation of agnps as shown in fig s2a in the absence of cl the absorbance peak at 410 nm decreased slightly due to the slow oxidative dissolution of agnps in water when cl was added at cl ag 1 the surface plasmon resonance spr peak red shifted and became broader obviously fig s2b which might be attributed to the irregular changes in morphology and particle size cathcart and kitaev 2011 guo et al 2021a karade et al 2021 similar phenomenon was also observed in fig s2c when cl ag was at 10 however the absorption peak at higher cl concentrations cl ag 100 and 1000 was similar to the pristine agnps until 120 h fig s2d and e indicating the morphology of agnps did not change distinctly at cl ag 10 000 the blue shifted absorption peak narrowed significantly and the intensity gradually decreased over time fig s2f suggesting both the particle size and concentration of agnps decreased it was reported that the chloride concentration played a more important role than the ionic strength in the dissolution of agnps chambers et al 2014 thus it is suggested that the above observations were attributed to the large difference in the cl concentrations similarly as shown in fig 1 the characteristic absorption peaks of agnps 1 μm decreased obviously in the presence of 0 01 mm cl while slightly in the presence of 0 1 mm cl notably as the concentration of cl increased to 1 and 10 mm the peaks at around 265 nm verified the formation of agcl nps guo et al 2021b which gradually disappeared as time prolonged when the concentration of cl increased to 100 mm the significant decrease and blue shift of the characteristic peak occurred simultaneously as predicted by the thermodynamics based on medusa and minteq simulations fig s3a and b the equilibrium distributions and predominant ag species changed distinctly as the cl ag ratio increased in the presence of cl ions agnps would transform to various products such as ag agcl and agclx x 1 species and therefore the total concentrations of the dissolved ag species and agcl were determined to quantitatively investigate the effects of cl ag ratio on the transformation kinetics of agnps as shown in fig 2 a and s4a a total of 9 1 4 2 9 5 10 2 and 30 7 of the original agnps were transformed after 120 h reaction when the ratio of cl ag was at 1 10 100 1000 and 10000 respectively which were all significantly higher than that of agnps in the absence of cl 0 9 the experimental data were further fitted by the first order rate law d a g d t k a g where ag represents the total concentration of transformed ag dissolved ag species and agcl at the reaction time t h and k h 1 represents the transformation rate constant of agnps as shown in fig 2b and table s1 agnps underwent dissolution at a rate of 0 0019 0 0003 h 1 in the absence of cl the transformation rate of agnps 0 0114 0 0023 h 1 was significantly accelerated when the cl ag ratio was 1 probably due to the intensively oxidative etching kent and vikesland 2012 yang et al 2007 as the cl ag ratio increased to 10 both the k value 0 0032 0 0003 h 1 and transformation percentage decreased distinctly however as the cl ag molar ratio increased to 100 and 1000 transformation percentage 9 5 10 2 and the rate constant 0 0074 0 0005 and 0 0077 0 0009 h 1 respectively all increased relative to the group of 10 1 cl ag more notably both of k 0 0252 0 0028 h 1 and transformation percentage increased substantially at cl ag 10 000 suggesting the significantly facilitated transformation of agnps chlorination of agnps was also conducted at 1 μm in the presence of cl at different concentrations 0 01 100 mm as shown in fig 2c and s4b agnps underwent transformation at rates of 0 0011 0 0001 0 0027 0 0001 0 0018 0 0002 0 0017 0 0001 0 0020 0 0001 0 0051 0 0003 h 1 in the presence of cl at concentrations of 0 0 01 0 1 1 10 and 100 mm respectively combining the results together we found that the transformation of agnps was dependent on the cl concentration but not monotonically implying that multiple transformation processes took place at various cl concentrations 3 2 chlorination mechanism of agnps 3 2 1 changes in the morphology of agnps as shown in fig 3 a agnps maintained the spherical shape in the absence of cl when the cl ag ratio was 1 polygonal nanoparticles with uneven sizes and rough surface were observed fig 3b these irregular transformation products were surrounded by some small particles which was probably caused by the etching effect of cl kent and vikesland 2012 wiley et al 2004 yang et al 2007 the dissolved ag reacted with cl to produce agcl s and the lattice fringe spacing in hrtem image matched well with chlorargyrite jcpds no 01 085 1355 fig 3g similar morphology changes were also observed at the cl ag ratio of 10 fig 3c due to the apparent morphology changes by intensive cl etching the particle size distribution became polydisperse fig s5 however the spherical agnps barely changed at cl ag 100 fig 3d which was in line with the marginal change in the uv vis absorption spectra fig s2d a thick layer 1 5 5 nm was obvious near the edge of the agnps which might be attributed to the formation of amorphous agcl s when cl ag was 1000 the size of the nps decreased slightly and the amorphous layer became thinner suggesting that the formed agcl s started to dissolve at this ratio fig 3e the hydrodynamic diameter also tended to decrease as the time prolonged and the difference became significant p 0 05 after 120 h fig s5 noteworthily at cl ag 10 000 although the nps still kept spherical morphology the particle size decreased significantly and the external agcl layer disappeared fig 3f indicating that the formed agcl s completely dissolved which then facilitated the dissolution of agnps by high concentration of chloride ions the tem edx mapping verifiably showed that silver and chloride elements overlapped on the surface of nps fig 4 a which was in line with the formation of amorphous agcl s on the surface fig 3d as the concentration of cl increased the cl element only covered a portion of the surface of agnps fig 4b and c confirming that the agcl s layer started to dissolve and became less dense the further transformation of agcl s to agclx x 1 led to the obvious decrease in the size of nps moreover xps was conducted to further examine the oxidation state of elements and the surface compositions of the chlorinated products as shown in fig s6a the high resolution xps spectra in the ag 3d region of the original agnps exhibited two peaks at binding energies of 367 3 and 373 3 ev corresponding to ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 peaks of metallic ag respectively turco et al 2018 zhou et al 2018a during chlorination the peaks at 368 3 and 374 3 ev fig s6a verified the formation of monovalent ag and the peaks at 198 2 and 199 9 ev fig s6b were ascribed to cl 2p3 2 and cl 2p1 2 respectively confirming the precipitation of agcl s on the surface of agnps thota et al 2022 turco et al 2018 the higher binding energy 530 7 ev of o 1s than that of silver oxide 528 6 ev indicated the negligible formation of silver oxide zhang et al 2016 besides the binding energies of c 1s n 1s and o 1s were similar to those of the original agnps fig s6c suggesting the pvp coating was still on the surface of agnps in the presence of cl at less than 1 mm chloride ions could diffuse through pvp coating and chlorination occurred on the surface of agnps 3 2 2 multistep chlorination mechanism the possible transformation processes involved in the chlorination of agnps are listed below 1 2 a g 0 1 2 o 2 2 h 2 a g h 2 o 2 a g c l a g c l 3 a g c l x 1 c l a g c l x x 1 x 2 3 4 given that oxidative dissolution of agnps is strongly mediated by do the role of do was further investigated in the presence of cl as shown in fig s7 and 5a when do decreased to 0 2 mg l 1 agnps underwent transformation at a slower rate of 0 0026 0 0005 and 0 0015 0 0004 h 1 at cl ag 1 and 100 respectively the removal of do from the solutions resulted in an obvious decrease in the transformation percentage indicating that oxygen had an important effect on the dissolution of agnps and the etching by cl however higher concentration of cl cl ag 10 000 led to the comparable transformed percentage and rate 0 0198 0 0017 h 1 after the removal of do fig s7c implying that the impact of cl overwhelmed that of do at higher cl concentration the above results suggested that the formation of agcl s layer on the surface of agnps played a critical role in further transformation of agnps to unveil the effect of cl on the following transformation agcl nps were prepared and the dissolution of agcl nps 1 μm was investigated the representative uv vis absorption peak at 262 nm and xrd pattern signified the pure agcl nps which had a regular size distribution around 20 nm fig s8 guo et al 2021b khan et al 2021 as shown in fig 5 b at the cl agcl molar ratios of 1000 and 10 000 there was marginal impact of cl on the dissolution of agcl nps however as the concentration of cl increased to a ratio of cl agcl 100 000 the dissolution of agcl nps was significantly promoted 0 0660 0 0148 h 1 due to formation of ag cl complexes agclx x 1 reaction 3 rong et al 2018 this observation verified the significantly accelerated transformation rate of agnps at cl ag 10 000 0 0252 0 0028 h 1 which was evidenced by the distinctly increased concentration of dissolved ag species fig s4a cervantes avilés et al 2019 mbanga et al 2022 it is worth to note that do had a negligible effect on the dissolution of agcl nps at high concentration of cl verifying the high concentration of cl overwhelmed the role of do in the dissolution of agcl s layer and core agnps the transformed products were further analyzed by xrd and the changes in the relative intensity ratios between facets are shown in fig 5c owing to the selective adsorption of pvp to ag 100 facets the synthesized agnps were enriched with ag 111 facets gan et al 2015 le ouay and stellacci 2015 cl ions were reported to adsorb preferentially onto the ag 111 facets which could readily react with oxygen molecule and dissolve li et al 2014 therefore due to the selective oxidative etching by cl the relative intensity ratios of 111 200 and 111 220 diffraction peaks of agnps decreased significantly p 0 01 at cl ag 1 compared with the original agnps which was consistent with the occurrence of irregular morphologies with sharp corners and edges in fig 3b zhou et al 2016 meanwhile the zeta potentials of agnps were measured over transformation time and the results are shown in fig 5d the zeta potential of agnps increased from 37 4 1 3 to 25 3 2 3 mv in the absence of cl when the cl ag ratio was 1 and 10 the zeta potential also tended to increase from 36 2 1 2 to 20 9 0 9 mv and from 29 9 1 5 mv to 25 9 2 9 mv respectively largely due to the adsorption of the dissolved ag onto the surface of nps li et al 2014 zhao et al 2021a additionally the smaller size of cl ion than the polymer chain of pvp makes cl easier to diffuse through the pvp coating and reach the surface of agnps zhou et al 2016 zhou et al 2018b the zeta potential of agnps changed slightly at the cl ag ratio of 100 suggesting the consumption of cl and gradual production of agcl s levard et al 2013 rong et al 2018 notably the relative intensity ratios of 111 200 and 111 220 diffraction peaks of agnps showed no significance difference from the control group p 0 05 confirming that the precipitation of agcl s layer covered the surface of agnps and retarded the dissolution of inner agnps li et al 2014 li et al 2018b zhang et al 2022c owing to the gradual dissolution of outer agcl s layer to agclx x 1 the relative intensity ratios of 111 200 and 111 220 diffraction peaks of agnps tended to decrease as the cl ag ratio increased to 1000 a significant decrease p 0 01 in both intensity ratios was observed when the cl ag ratio was 10 000 verifying the subsequent dissolution of inner agnps accompanied by the disappearance of outer agcl s layer fig 3f levard et al 2013 li et al 2018b the above results fortified a strongly concentration dependent effect of cl on the chlorination of agnps and the multiple transformation processes could be concluded as following i when cl ag was 1 agnps transformation was promoted due to the intensive etching by cl ii as the concentration of cl increased precipitation of agcl s formed on the surface of agnps which acted as a barrier to protect the core agnps from further dissolution thus leading to the decreased dissolution rate of agnps iii at higher cl ag molar ratio 10000 the agcl s protection layer tended to dissolve rapidly due to the formation of soluble agclx x 1 species which subsequently promoted the dissolution of the inner agnps 3 3 impacts of environmental factors 3 3 1 effect of electrolytes as shown in fig 6a and s9a the facilitated transformation of agnps in the presence of electrolyte was observed and the promotion effect of divalent cations mg2 and ca2 was stronger than that of monovalent cations na and k this was consistent with the enhanced dissolution of agnps with an increase in ionic strength reported previously huang et al 2020 wang et al 2019 noteworthily the concentrations of the dissolved ag species in divalent cations after 120 h 0 40 0 05 and 0 34 0 03 μm in mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 respectively were significantly higher p 0 05 than that in water 0 18 0 01 μm or in monovalent cations 0 21 0 04 and 0 21 0 03 μm in nano3 and kno3 respectively while the concentration of agcl s was not statistically significant the speciation diagrams created in minteq fig s3c may help to understand the compositions of ag species in different electrolyte types ag ions account for 21 8 21 8 23 7 and 23 6 in the presence of 3 mm nano3 kno3 mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 respectively which were higher than that in water 19 8 while agcl s exhibited an opposite trend the addition of electrolytes increased the total concentrations of ions in the mixture solutions thus depressed the combination of ag with cl and ultimately increased the solubility of agcl s via salt in effect as a result the experimental and theoretical results consistently indicated that electrolytes especially with higher valences could substantially promote agnps dissolution by suppressing the formation of agcl s 3 3 2 effect of surfactants as shown in fig 6b and s9b ctan promoted the transformation rate of agnps while sds did not affect the transformation distinctly the characteristic peak of agnps in the uv vis absorption spectra decreased rapidly and broadened obviously in the presence of ctan while a marginal decline was observed in sds fig s10a b the corroded nanoparticles surrounded the initial agnps in the presence of ctan fig s10c and the diffraction peaks 111 200 intensity ratio of agnps decreased from 3 5 to 2 8 fig s11a as reported in our previous study the cationic surfactant ctan preferred to bind with the ag 111 facet and promoted corrosion of the initial nanostructure thus accelerated the dissolution of agnps zhang et al 2018b in contrast sds did not distinctly change the colloidal stability neither the diffraction peaks 111 200 intensity ratio 3 3 of agnps consequently sds exhibited negligible effect on the dissolution of agnps as shown in fig s11b after 120 h transformation in the presence of cl the generated amount of agcl s accounted for 5 3 5 5 and 8 3 in water sds and ctan respectively verifying the chlorination of agnps was also promoted by ctan 3 3 3 effect of nom fig s12a and b compared the changes of the absorption peaks of agnps in the presence of ha or fa with the control group fig s2c based on the first order rate law the transformation rate of agnps were 0 0023 0 0003 and 0 0025 0 0004 h 1 in the presence of ha and fa fig 6c and s9c respectively which were slower than that without nom 0 0032 0 0003 h 1 p 0 05 indicating that both ha and fa inhibited the chlorination of agnps the binding affinity between nom and agnps was further investigated by the fluorescence quenching experiments as presented in fig s12c and d after the addition of agnps the fluorescence intensities of ha excitation emission 335 420 nm and fa excitation emission 265 410 nm decreased by 31 3 and 21 6 respectively suggesting strong interaction was formed between nom and agnps which could lead to the formation of nom corona on the surface of agnps li et al 2018a tan et al 2023 in the absence of cl the dissolution percentage of agnps was 2 4 and 3 5 with the addition of ha and fa after 120 h reaction respectively which was distinctly lower than that of control 9 1 indicating that formation of nom corona inhibited the dissolution of agnps as reported previously ha and fa adsorbed on the surface of agnps and blocked the active sites for oxidation of agnps azodi et al 2016 li et al 2018a thus inhibiting the dissolution of agnps the decreased concentration of the released ag would lead to the subsequent inhibited chlorination these results highlighted the importance of environmental factors on the chloride induced transformations of agnps 4 conclusions the present study demonstrated that the ubiquitous inorganic ligand cl played a critical role in the chemical transformation and morphology changes of agnps which were strongly dependent on the cl ag molar ratios the co present environmental constituents could affect the dissolution of agnps followed by the interaction with cl the multistep transformation processes would lead to the formation of different transformed products such as ag nps with a stabilizing agcl s shell or soluble agclx x 1 which result in the distinct potential risks and toxic mechanisms of agnps the results of this study provide more comprehensive information on evaluating the transformations of agnps in natural chloride rich waters such as freshwater ecosystems the concentration of cl at sub mm level and seawater with a cl ag ratio higher than 105 besides the interactive effect of chloride with other environmental components was essential to understand the ultimate fate of agnps under realistic environmental conditions and should be taken into the fate prediction and risk assessment of agnps in aquatic environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14731,aquatic ecosystems are among the main destination for microplastics mps in the environment mps that enter aquatic ecosystems can contribute to pollution together with other co existing pollutants however whether such pollution results in higher or lower toxicity to fish than that caused by co existing pollutants alone remains controversial this study aimed at closing this research gap based on 1380 biological endpoints under the background of environmental mp concentrations collected from 55 laboratory studies overall mps in co existing pollutant solutions significantly increased the toxicity to fish specifically mps elevated negative effects on the immune system metabolism and oxidative damage subgroup analysis indicated that changes in toxicity were related to fish life stage and mp size but not to co existing pollutant or mp type meta regression analysis indicated that changes in toxicity were not related to the logarithm of the octanol water partition coefficient logkow or exposure time finally the differences between laboratory research and the actual aquatic environment were discussed from four aspects mps co existing pollutants environmental factors and experimental objects our study provides a basis for further understanding the potential impact of mps on aquatic organisms from a combined pollution perspective moreover our results can provide a reference for the conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics combined pollution toxicity changes fish meta analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction between 1950 and 2015 the world produced approximately 6 3 billion metric tons of plastic waste of which 79 were discarded or buried in the environment geyer et al 2017 large quantities of plastics eventually enter aquatic ecosystems with an estimated 19 23 mt worldwide in 2016 alone borrelle et al 2020 plastic debris in the environment gradually breaks down into microplastics mps 5 mm in diameter through physical chemical and biological weathering browne et al 2011 thompson et al 2004 mps also include textile fibres and microbeads that are initially 5 mm fendall and sewell 2009 mps are widely distributed in aquatic ecosystems even in polar regions and deep sea trenches abel et al 2022 ding et al 2022 zhang et al 2022b mp levels can amount to tens of thousands of particles per cubic meter in natural water bodies bergmann et al 2015 besseling et al 2019 resulting in their intentional or unintentional ingestion by aquatic organisms through feeding and breathing li et al 2021 yu et al 2022 several studies have shown the widespread distribution of mps in aquatic organisms such as crustaceans li et al 2022a bivalves naidu et al 2022a zooplankton botterell et al 2022 and fish wardlaw et al 2022 chen et al 2022c reported that more than 90 of the fish digestive tract contained mps in the nandu river the largest river in hainan province china wardlaw et al 2022 investigated common carp cyprinus carpio in the thames river ontario canada and found up to 128 mps in one fish mps have a large specific surface area and high hydrophobicity atugoda et al 2021 bhagat et al 2021 pollutants including persistent organic pollutants pops pesticides heavy metals and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps can be adsorbed by mps with adsorption coefficients reaching 105 106 nguyen et al 2022 mato et al 2001 mo et al 2021 sun et al 2022a therefore mps can influence pollutant bioavailability thus affecting toxicity herzke et al 2016 he et al 2021 liu et al 2022 wang et al 2020 liu et al 2022 found that polystyrene ps mps enhanced tetracycline oxidative damage to grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella he et al 2021 found that the damaging effect of triphenyl phosphate on the reproductive performance of zebrafish danio rerio increased in the presence of ps mps however elizalde velázquez et al 2022 found that mps reduced the mortality and malformation rate of metformin and guanylurea to zebrafish danio rerio embryos li et al 2022a found that ps mps can reduce the accumulation of benzopyrene in zebrafish and oxidative damage to the liver therefore the toxicity of the combined pollution of mps and pollutants to aquatic organisms remains controversial fish are a major component of aquatic ecosystems and have important influence on its structure and function menezes et al 2010 yu et al 2021 moreover fish is an important component of the human diet and a crucial source of protein and micronutrients naylor et al 2021 thilsted et al 2016 in 2017 fish provided approximately 20 of the per capita animal protein intake for about 3 3 billion people and 10 for 5 6 billion people globally fao 2021 additionally pollutants may be transferred from fish to humans through the food chain ma et al 2021 dissolved pollutants are more easily bioavailable and migrate more readily than particulate pollutants lefevre et al 2014 therefore in this study fish and dissolved pollutants were considered as the major organisms and form of interest respectively responding to the controversial question what are the effects of mps on the toxicity of co existing pollutants to fish a meta analysis was conducted to quantitatively summarize existing experimental evidence from global literature and effect size estimators were used to determine changes in toxicity direction and magnitude and effects on biological function and systems berlino et al 2021 salerno et al 2021 in addition the factors fish life stage co existing pollutant type and mp type and size that may affect toxicity were explored through subgroup analysis and the correlation between toxicity changes and exposure time logarithm of octanol water partition coefficient logkow were explored by meta regression analysis lastly gaps in the current study were discussed our study provides a basis for further understanding the potential impact of mps on aquatic organisms from the perspective of combined pollution moreover given that pollution is an important factor in the decline of fishery resources fao 2022 our study can provide a reference for conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 environmentally relevant concentrations of mps to establish environmentally relevant concentrations of mps used in laboratory studies thresholds for these concentrations have to be determined however field investigations are expressed in terms of the number of particles in a specific volume particles l whereas the majority of laboratory toxicity studies report mp concentrations in units of mass per volume mg l therefore field investigation threshold concentrations should be converted into mass concentrations the concentrations of mps detected globally in aquatic environment to date have mostly been below 100 particles l bergmann et al 2015 besseling et al 2019 only in a few places did the concentration exceed 100 particles l while being in the same order of magnitude gurjar et al 2022 naidu et al 2022b additionally the estimated average mass of a large number of mps collected from the environment is 5 μg particle besseling et al 2019 claessens et al 2011 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 therefore 0 5 mg l was selected as the environmental mp concentration threshold the equation below was used to convert data from a limited number of laboratory studies expressed in particles l into mass concentrations leusch and ziajahromi 2021 because mps in particles l in these studies were spherical only the equation for spherical mps is provided y mg l π 6 density g c m 3 diameter μ m 3 x beads l 10 9 unit conversion factor 2 2 literature search and data collection a systematic literature search was conducted following the prisma guidelines preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses fig 1 based on the search methods of previous meta analysis articles and extensive reading of relevant research papers benitez lopez et al 2017 berlino et al 2021 salerno et al 2021 sun et al 2022b wu and seebacher 2020 strings for a comprehensive search using web of science all databases and scopus were determined these are provided in supplementary text s1 the publication year limit was post 2004 because mp was introduced in 2004 thompson et al 2004 the final search date was october 10 2022 there were 5650 and 2198 search results in web of science and scopus respectively the included studies met the following criteria 1 peer reviewed research paper 2 laboratory experiment in which the experimental objects were fish that were randomly grouped 3 no other pollutants present on mps and co existing pollutants were dissolved 4 experiments combining mps and co existing pollutants combined group as well as experiments with co existing pollutants solely single group experimental conditions were consistent 5 quantitative response indicators with mean standard deviation sd standard error se and number of replicates n one hundred forty four research papers were initially screened based on their titles and abstracts and the references of each article were carefully read and checked to identify possible additional data sources if new studies were found from the references the above steps were repeated until no relevant studies were found benitez lopez et al 2017 eventually 55 studies were included the main reasons for exclusion are provided in supplementary text s2 notably some datapoints from the 55 included studies were excluded as well because of incomplete response indicator data details of included and excluded studies are provided in tables s1 and s2 respectively the following information was extracted from each article article information title first author publication year response indicator data of combined and single groups mean value n and sd or se fish information species growth stage mp information type size aging or not and concentration co existing pollutant information name concentration and exposure time if article data were graphically represented the getdata graph digitizer 2 25 software was used to extract the data han et al 2022 when a study tested response indicators at 3 time points only data from the initial and the final time points were included to reduce an excessive proportion for these indicators foley et al 2018 when theoretical and measured values of mps or co existing pollutant concentrations were present in the study these theoretical values were uniformly incorporated because majority of studies reported only theoretical concentration values to ensure data quality only response indicator data with 3 independent replicates were included han et al 2022 2 3 effect size calculation hedges g was used to estimate differences in the toxicity between the combined and single groups which is one of the most commonly used methods in the fields of ecology and environmental sciences hedges 1981 berlino et al 2021 salerno et al 2021 the calculation equations are as follows 1 hedges g y c y s standard deviation pooled j 2 hedges g y s y c standard deviation pooled j 3 hedges g y c y s standard deviation pooled j 4 hedges g y c y s standard deviation pooled j y c and y s are the average values of the response indicators of the combined and single groups respectively j represents bias correction and the equations for j and standard deviation are as follows j 1 3 4 n c n s 2 1 standard deviation pooled n c 1 s d c 2 n s 1 s d s 2 n c n s 2 n c and n s represent the sample size of the combined and single groups respectively s d c and s d s represent the standard deviation of the combined and single groups respectively if a study reported an se it was converted to sd using sd se n the variance for each effect size v g was calculated and the effect sizes weighted using the inverse of the variance the calculation equation is as follows v g n c n t n c n s g 2 2 n c n s hedges g value and the variance for each biological endpoint were calculated k 1380 in our total dataset in this study a positive value of hedges g indicated that the presence of mps in the solution of co existing pollutants reduced their toxicity to fish and a negative value indicated that toxicity is increased the direction was determined based on specific studies and the response indicator divided into three categories based on data type i a value increase indicates a positive effect e g survival rate body weight ii a value increase indicates a negative effect e g mortality and malformation rate and iii both an increase and decrease have a negative impact compared with the normal value e g thymine level heart rate eqs 1 and 2 were used for i and ii respectively for iii the blank group value no mps or co existing pollutants in the water was included as a reference which was present in all included studies when the value of the combined and single groups was on one side of the blank group e g the value of the combined group was 30 that of the single group 20 and that of the blank group 15 and if the absolute value of the difference between the combined and blank groups was lower than that between the single and blank groups eq 3 was used otherwise eq 4 was used when the values of the combined and single groups were on both sides of the blank group e g the value of the combined group was 30 that of the single group 15 and that of the blank group 20 the value in the combined or single group was first made symmetrical to the value of the blank group the previous value becomes 30 for the combined group 25 for the single group and 20 for the blank group the subsequent use of the equation was consistent with the value on the same side according to hedges g value the degree of influence can be divided into four categories g 0 2 small effect 0 2 g 0 5 medium effect 0 5 g 0 8 large effect and g 0 8 very large effect berlino et al 2021 salerno et al 2021 2 4 data gap filling and categorization according to the specific toxicity data of this study and referring to related studies foley et al 2018 han et al 2022 jacob et al 2020 salerno et al 2021 sun et al 2022b wu and seebacher 2020 toxicity indicators were classified into seven categories including growth and development behavioural sensory and neuromuscular functions immune system metabolism reproduction alimentary and excretory systems and oxidative damage when an indicator had more than one biological implication such as lactate dehydrogenase which not only indicates changes in cellular energy production pathways but also damage to cells and tissues santos et al 2022a it was categorized according to the emphasis by the authors of the specific study jacob et al 2020 table s3 provides a detailed indicator classification subgroup meta regression analysis was conducted to explore influencing factors that affect toxicity changes with the following categorical continuous moderators that may have an impact as confirmed by previous studies bhagat et al 2021 covernton et al 2021 fu et al 2021 huang et al 2021 qiao et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 1 life stage of fish early life stage juvenile and adult larvae and embryos were classified as early life stages because some studies investigated both stages simultaneously for a few studies that did not mention the life stage but mentioned the body to fish growth time relevant literature was referred to determine the life stage as precisely as possible 2 mp type 3 mp size 1 μm and 1 μm this study was focused on comparing the toxicity between nanoplastics and mps nanoplastics are defined as plastic particles 1 μm gigault et al 2018 koelmans et al 2019 or 0 1 μm ng et al 2018 strungaru et al 2019 considering the data amount of nanoplastics 1 μm was chosen as the threshold to make our study more representative 4 co existing pollutant type organic and inorganic pollutants heavy metals the reason for this classification is that the adsorption mechanism of organic and inorganic pollutants on mps differs cao et al 2021 fu et al 2021 hydrophobicity is important in affecting the adsorption of organic pollutants on mps and it can be reflected by logkow li et al 2018 mei et al 2020 organic pollutants with high logkow are more easily absorbed by mps fu et al 2021 the relationship between hydrophobicity and effect value was discussed through meta regression analysis in addition hydrophobicity is important in affecting the enrichment of organic pollutants in organisms wen et al 2012 according to the chinese guidelines for the classification of aquatic environmental hazards gb t 36700 5 2018 if the logkow of organic pollutants is 4 it is considered to have biological enrichment potential therefore the relationship between hydrophobicity and effect values was further discussed using meta regression analysis in two parts with 4 as the dividing line logkow values were first obtained from the united states national library of medicine https chem nlm nih gov chemidplus chemidlite jsp and those not available were supplemented by those available at https www chemsrc com 5 exposure time exposure time and logkow value were continuous moderators and the remaining moderators fish life stage co existing pollutant type and mp type and size were categorical moderators further details are provided in table s1 2 5 statistical analysis as multiple response indicators were extracted from a single study the data may not be independent see section 3 1 for a detailed explanation of the non independence between indicators nakagawa et al 2017 therefore a three level meta analytical model was created to address this problem first different studies were distinguished by author then the data in the same study were composed of groups with different exposure conditions mp concentration type co existing pollutant concentration exposure time and the response indicators of the same group of fish were nested into one group wu and seebacher 2020 salerno et al 2021 a multivariate meta analysis model in r was constructed using the metafor package rma mv to estimate the overall effect size and 95 confidence interval ci for the datasets effect sizes were considered significant if the 95 ci did not overlap with zero salerno et al 2021 for categorical and continuous moderators the effect was considered significant when the p value of the test for moderators was 0 05 publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot egger s regression and the trim and fill method hossain and olden 2022 wu and seebacher 2020 in general without publication bias the drawing would resemble a symmetrical inverted funnel hossain and olden 2022 the funnel plot showed relative asymmetry and was confirmed by egger s test p 0 05 but the significance and direction of the effect values did not change after using the trim and fill method fig s1 thus our results were robust meta analysis data are presented as mean effect size se 3 results and discussion 3 1 presence of mps aggravates toxicity a total of 1380 biological endpoints were obtained from 55 studies the overall effect determined via the multivariate model indicated that mps in co existing pollutant solutions significantly increased the toxicity to fish to a medium extent g 0 30 0 11 p 0 0056 fig 2 the impact of the presence of mps in a solution of co existing pollutants on the toxicity of fish with seven trait categories was focused on the results indicated that there were significant negative effects on the immune system g 0 72 0 14 p 0 0001 metabolism g 0 61 0 14 p 0 0001 and oxidative damage g 0 29 0 13 p 0 02 but no significant effects on growth and development p 0 05 behavioural sensory and neuromuscular functions p 0 05 alimentary and excretory systems p 0 05 and reproduction p 0 05 fish immune systems are very sensitive to exogenous disturbances and changes in innate immunity can be used as early indicators of responses to these disturbances jacob et al 2020 tort 2011 wen et al 2018 additionally many resources are allocated to deal with exogenous disturbances as these can lead to metabolic recombination and disorder santos et al 2022b wen et al 2018 metabolic disorder affects the energy availability of the immune system such as the production of antibodies and protein synthesis which leads to suppression of the immune response tort 2011 due to the high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the plasma membrane of immune cells and high production of reactive oxygen species immune cells are particularly sensitive to oxidative stress and cellular oxidative damage impairs the integrity and function of immune cell membranes cellular protein and nucleic acid knight 2000 yang et al 2020 found that exacerbation of oxidative damage after exposure of ps mps 6 2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate f 53b compared with f 53b enhanced the inflammatory response of zebrafish larvae oxidative damage of cells also interferes with the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates leading to metabolic disorder banaee et al 2019 sheng et al 2021 banaee et al 2019 found that cell membrane damage of common carp cyprinus carpio exposed to mps cadmium changed triglycerides and cholesterol circulating levels simultaneously metabolic changes also affect oxidative damage zhang et al 2022c zhang et al 2022c found that exposure of crucian carp carassius auratus to aging mps roxithromycin changed the metabolism of galactose and affected oxidative damage to fish although the current data showed that the existence of mps in a solution of co existing pollutants had no significant negative impact on the four classifications of fish on a systemic level there was a relationship between different trait classifications of fish metabolic disorders eventually lead to abnormal behavior brun et al 2019 for example when the activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase is inhibited the energy acquisition of fish declines limiting the ability to find food and escape predators oliveira et al 2013 oxidative damage can inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity leading to neurotoxicity banaee et al 2019 moreover under exogenous disturbances the redistribution of energy may be far away from development and reproduction which may have potential later health consequences brun et al 2019 santos et al 2022b therefore the toxicology of combined pollution on fish still needs further attention 3 2 factors influencing toxicity changes 3 2 1 fish there were significant differences between the groups with regard to the life stages of fish p 0 0071 fig 3 mps in co existing pollutant solutions significantly increased the toxicity to adult fish to a large extent g 0 61 0 17 p 0 0004 but had no significant effect on early life stage and juvenile p 0 05 compared with early life stages and juvenile fish adult fish are less sensitive to pollutants due to a perfect homeostasis mechanism and mature immune system beiras et al 2018 liu et al 2012 mohammed 2013 thus it is difficult to reach the tolerance limit and the toxicity changes over a wider range moreover adult fish are more likely to ingest mps which can alter the bioavailability of co existing pollutants and thus toxicity covernton et al 2021 huang et al 2020 considering combined pollution the effects of mps on fish should be a concern at every life stage 3 2 2 co existing pollutants mechanisms of organic pollutant adsorption on mps includes hydrophobicity hydrogen bonds π π bonds van der waals forces and electrostatic interactions bhagat et al 2021 mei et al 2020 while mechanisms of heavy metals adsorption on mps are complexation of cations with the mp surface and repulsion or attraction of charged molecules brennecke et al 2016 cao et al 2021 our results showed no significant differences between organic and inorganic pollutants p 0 05 fig 3 moreover our results showed that there was no correlation between effect values and logkow under the three classifications p 0 05 the distribution of logkow and the corresponding effect values is shown in fig s2 interactive effects of mps and pollutants on fish toxicity are complex and depend not only on the adsorption of pollutants on mps but also on the ingestion of mps and the rate of resolution in the gastrointestinal tract fan et al 2021 ito et al 2022 li et al 2021 ito et al 2022 found that the ability to desorb polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs from polyethylene pe mps differed in the digestive tract of two fish species red seabream and mummichog with different structures 3 2 3 microplastics the type size shape colour and aging of mps can affect the adsorption of co existing pollutants and their uptake by fish mei et al 2020 mo et al 2021 the experimental data collected were almost identical for mps with regard to shape sphere or particle colour white grey and surface property original thus only mp type and size were studies different types of mps have different densities which affect their distribution in water layers and consequently different contact opportunities with fish ma et al 2020 in addition different types of mps differ in their ability to absorb pollutants due to differences in functional groups and polarity fu et al 2021 however there was no significant difference between groups with changes in fish toxicity p 0 05 fig 3 most of the included studies used ps k 980 while very few studies used other types whose effects may therefore be under represented our results revealed significant differences between mp sizes 1 μm and 1 μm p 0 0293 fig 3 the presence of mps 1 μm had a significant effect g 0 60 0 18 p 0 0008 while that of 1 μm mps had no significant effect p 0 05 this is because the smaller the mps the easier they can be ingested by fish and enter their tissues he et al 2021 singh et al 2021 additionally smaller particles have a larger specific surface area than larger particles and can adsorb more co existing pollutants thereby exhibiting greater toxicity qiao et al 2019 mo et al 2021 qiao et al 2019 found that 0 1 μm mps significantly increased copper adsorption and bioaccumulation in zebrafish compared to 20 μm mps which aggravated intestine and liver toxicity 3 2 4 exposure time another aim of this study was to determine whether the impact of mps in co existing pollutants solutions on fish were correlated with exposure time our results showed no correlation p 0 05 fish have a stronger stress response at the beginning of changes in the external environment but organisms can actively adapt to their environment and may undergo a series of physiological changes to gradually adapt over time cheng et al 2012 sun et al 2022b zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 reported that exposing red tilapia oreochromis niloticus to mps roxithromycin for two weeks showed roxithromycin peaking at 3 6 days in different organs which then gradually decreased and the effect was more obvious at high concentrations this may be due to the low intake and high excretion during late stages of exposure undoubtedly there is a possibility that increases in exposure time may let the fish defence system collapse altering the original trend of changes in response indicators li et al 2022b sun et al 2021 3 3 limitations our study is a meta analysis of laboratory data with the aim of further understanding the impact of mps on organisms by the combined pollution of mps and co existing pollutants however the current work has certain limitations 1 differences in mps between the laboratory and actual environment mps used in the laboratory are relatively uniform the type is mainly ps the shape is mainly spherical and granular the colour is mainly white grey the surface property is mainly original and there is a limited number of studies on millimetre scales whereas mps in the actual environment are complex and diverse these factors affect the adsorption and desorption behaviour of co existing pollutants or the ingestion of fish or intestinal retention time jabeen et al 2017 mei et al 2020 mo et al 2021 sun et al 2022b yang et al 2022 moreover mps form biofilms in the actual environment which affects the adsorption of co existing pollutants zhang et al 2022a 2 differences in co existing pollutants between the laboratory and actual environment usually only one co existing pollutant is used in the laboratory but various pollutants are found in the environment at the same time and competitive adsorption exists in the actual environment additionally the concentration in the laboratory is higher than that in the actual environment 3 difference in environmental factors between the laboratory and actual environments temperature salinity ph ionic strength and natural organic substances fluctuate in the actual environment which affects the adsorption and desorption behavior of mps which is not the case under stable conditions during laboratory experiments fu et al 2021 in addition the body condition and indicators of fish are greatly affected by temperature fonte et al 2016 kratina et al 2019 4 difference in experimental objects between the laboratory and actual environments the fish used in the laboratory are mainly zebrafish although some studies use other species of fish they remain limited compared with the species in the actual environment different fish species may result in different experimental results due to differences in environmental adaptability habitat feeding habits and intestinal structure jabeen et al 2017 huang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 in summary further studies should address such discrepancies between research conducted under laboratory and natural environmental conditions 4 conclusions a meta analysis was performed to demonstrate that the presence of mps in co existing pollutant solutions significantly increases toxicity to fish under the background of environmental mp concentration mps increase negative effects on the immune system metabolism and oxidative damage but not on growth and development behavioral sensory and neuromuscular functions alimentary and excretory systems and reproduction subgroup analysis indicated that changes in toxicity were related to the fish life stage and mp size but not to co existing pollutant or mp type meta regression analysis indicated that changes in toxicity were not related to logkow or exposure time finally differences between laboratory research and actual aquatic environment were discussed from four aspects mps co existing pollutants environmental factors and experimental objects these differences may compromise assessment accuracy and warrant further research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

14731,aquatic ecosystems are among the main destination for microplastics mps in the environment mps that enter aquatic ecosystems can contribute to pollution together with other co existing pollutants however whether such pollution results in higher or lower toxicity to fish than that caused by co existing pollutants alone remains controversial this study aimed at closing this research gap based on 1380 biological endpoints under the background of environmental mp concentrations collected from 55 laboratory studies overall mps in co existing pollutant solutions significantly increased the toxicity to fish specifically mps elevated negative effects on the immune system metabolism and oxidative damage subgroup analysis indicated that changes in toxicity were related to fish life stage and mp size but not to co existing pollutant or mp type meta regression analysis indicated that changes in toxicity were not related to the logarithm of the octanol water partition coefficient logkow or exposure time finally the differences between laboratory research and the actual aquatic environment were discussed from four aspects mps co existing pollutants environmental factors and experimental objects our study provides a basis for further understanding the potential impact of mps on aquatic organisms from a combined pollution perspective moreover our results can provide a reference for the conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics combined pollution toxicity changes fish meta analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction between 1950 and 2015 the world produced approximately 6 3 billion metric tons of plastic waste of which 79 were discarded or buried in the environment geyer et al 2017 large quantities of plastics eventually enter aquatic ecosystems with an estimated 19 23 mt worldwide in 2016 alone borrelle et al 2020 plastic debris in the environment gradually breaks down into microplastics mps 5 mm in diameter through physical chemical and biological weathering browne et al 2011 thompson et al 2004 mps also include textile fibres and microbeads that are initially 5 mm fendall and sewell 2009 mps are widely distributed in aquatic ecosystems even in polar regions and deep sea trenches abel et al 2022 ding et al 2022 zhang et al 2022b mp levels can amount to tens of thousands of particles per cubic meter in natural water bodies bergmann et al 2015 besseling et al 2019 resulting in their intentional or unintentional ingestion by aquatic organisms through feeding and breathing li et al 2021 yu et al 2022 several studies have shown the widespread distribution of mps in aquatic organisms such as crustaceans li et al 2022a bivalves naidu et al 2022a zooplankton botterell et al 2022 and fish wardlaw et al 2022 chen et al 2022c reported that more than 90 of the fish digestive tract contained mps in the nandu river the largest river in hainan province china wardlaw et al 2022 investigated common carp cyprinus carpio in the thames river ontario canada and found up to 128 mps in one fish mps have a large specific surface area and high hydrophobicity atugoda et al 2021 bhagat et al 2021 pollutants including persistent organic pollutants pops pesticides heavy metals and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps can be adsorbed by mps with adsorption coefficients reaching 105 106 nguyen et al 2022 mato et al 2001 mo et al 2021 sun et al 2022a therefore mps can influence pollutant bioavailability thus affecting toxicity herzke et al 2016 he et al 2021 liu et al 2022 wang et al 2020 liu et al 2022 found that polystyrene ps mps enhanced tetracycline oxidative damage to grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella he et al 2021 found that the damaging effect of triphenyl phosphate on the reproductive performance of zebrafish danio rerio increased in the presence of ps mps however elizalde velázquez et al 2022 found that mps reduced the mortality and malformation rate of metformin and guanylurea to zebrafish danio rerio embryos li et al 2022a found that ps mps can reduce the accumulation of benzopyrene in zebrafish and oxidative damage to the liver therefore the toxicity of the combined pollution of mps and pollutants to aquatic organisms remains controversial fish are a major component of aquatic ecosystems and have important influence on its structure and function menezes et al 2010 yu et al 2021 moreover fish is an important component of the human diet and a crucial source of protein and micronutrients naylor et al 2021 thilsted et al 2016 in 2017 fish provided approximately 20 of the per capita animal protein intake for about 3 3 billion people and 10 for 5 6 billion people globally fao 2021 additionally pollutants may be transferred from fish to humans through the food chain ma et al 2021 dissolved pollutants are more easily bioavailable and migrate more readily than particulate pollutants lefevre et al 2014 therefore in this study fish and dissolved pollutants were considered as the major organisms and form of interest respectively responding to the controversial question what are the effects of mps on the toxicity of co existing pollutants to fish a meta analysis was conducted to quantitatively summarize existing experimental evidence from global literature and effect size estimators were used to determine changes in toxicity direction and magnitude and effects on biological function and systems berlino et al 2021 salerno et al 2021 in addition the factors fish life stage co existing pollutant type and mp type and size that may affect toxicity were explored through subgroup analysis and the correlation between toxicity changes and exposure time logarithm of octanol water partition coefficient logkow were explored by meta regression analysis lastly gaps in the current study were discussed our study provides a basis for further understanding the potential impact of mps on aquatic organisms from the perspective of combined pollution moreover given that pollution is an important factor in the decline of fishery resources fao 2022 our study can provide a reference for conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 environmentally relevant concentrations of mps to establish environmentally relevant concentrations of mps used in laboratory studies thresholds for these concentrations have to be determined however field investigations are expressed in terms of the number of particles in a specific volume particles l whereas the majority of laboratory toxicity studies report mp concentrations in units of mass per volume mg l therefore field investigation threshold concentrations should be converted into mass concentrations the concentrations of mps detected globally in aquatic environment to date have mostly been below 100 particles l bergmann et al 2015 besseling et al 2019 only in a few places did the concentration exceed 100 particles l while being in the same order of magnitude gurjar et al 2022 naidu et al 2022b additionally the estimated average mass of a large number of mps collected from the environment is 5 μg particle besseling et al 2019 claessens et al 2011 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 therefore 0 5 mg l was selected as the environmental mp concentration threshold the equation below was used to convert data from a limited number of laboratory studies expressed in particles l into mass concentrations leusch and ziajahromi 2021 because mps in particles l in these studies were spherical only the equation for spherical mps is provided y mg l π 6 density g c m 3 diameter μ m 3 x beads l 10 9 unit conversion factor 2 2 literature search and data collection a systematic literature search was conducted following the prisma guidelines preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses fig 1 based on the search methods of previous meta analysis articles and extensive reading of relevant research papers benitez lopez et al 2017 berlino et al 2021 salerno et al 2021 sun et al 2022b wu and seebacher 2020 strings for a comprehensive search using web of science all databases and scopus were determined these are provided in supplementary text s1 the publication year limit was post 2004 because mp was introduced in 2004 thompson et al 2004 the final search date was october 10 2022 there were 5650 and 2198 search results in web of science and scopus respectively the included studies met the following criteria 1 peer reviewed research paper 2 laboratory experiment in which the experimental objects were fish that were randomly grouped 3 no other pollutants present on mps and co existing pollutants were dissolved 4 experiments combining mps and co existing pollutants combined group as well as experiments with co existing pollutants solely single group experimental conditions were consistent 5 quantitative response indicators with mean standard deviation sd standard error se and number of replicates n one hundred forty four research papers were initially screened based on their titles and abstracts and the references of each article were carefully read and checked to identify possible additional data sources if new studies were found from the references the above steps were repeated until no relevant studies were found benitez lopez et al 2017 eventually 55 studies were included the main reasons for exclusion are provided in supplementary text s2 notably some datapoints from the 55 included studies were excluded as well because of incomplete response indicator data details of included and excluded studies are provided in tables s1 and s2 respectively the following information was extracted from each article article information title first author publication year response indicator data of combined and single groups mean value n and sd or se fish information species growth stage mp information type size aging or not and concentration co existing pollutant information name concentration and exposure time if article data were graphically represented the getdata graph digitizer 2 25 software was used to extract the data han et al 2022 when a study tested response indicators at 3 time points only data from the initial and the final time points were included to reduce an excessive proportion for these indicators foley et al 2018 when theoretical and measured values of mps or co existing pollutant concentrations were present in the study these theoretical values were uniformly incorporated because majority of studies reported only theoretical concentration values to ensure data quality only response indicator data with 3 independent replicates were included han et al 2022 2 3 effect size calculation hedges g was used to estimate differences in the toxicity between the combined and single groups which is one of the most commonly used methods in the fields of ecology and environmental sciences hedges 1981 berlino et al 2021 salerno et al 2021 the calculation equations are as follows 1 hedges g y c y s standard deviation pooled j 2 hedges g y s y c standard deviation pooled j 3 hedges g y c y s standard deviation pooled j 4 hedges g y c y s standard deviation pooled j y c and y s are the average values of the response indicators of the combined and single groups respectively j represents bias correction and the equations for j and standard deviation are as follows j 1 3 4 n c n s 2 1 standard deviation pooled n c 1 s d c 2 n s 1 s d s 2 n c n s 2 n c and n s represent the sample size of the combined and single groups respectively s d c and s d s represent the standard deviation of the combined and single groups respectively if a study reported an se it was converted to sd using sd se n the variance for each effect size v g was calculated and the effect sizes weighted using the inverse of the variance the calculation equation is as follows v g n c n t n c n s g 2 2 n c n s hedges g value and the variance for each biological endpoint were calculated k 1380 in our total dataset in this study a positive value of hedges g indicated that the presence of mps in the solution of co existing pollutants reduced their toxicity to fish and a negative value indicated that toxicity is increased the direction was determined based on specific studies and the response indicator divided into three categories based on data type i a value increase indicates a positive effect e g survival rate body weight ii a value increase indicates a negative effect e g mortality and malformation rate and iii both an increase and decrease have a negative impact compared with the normal value e g thymine level heart rate eqs 1 and 2 were used for i and ii respectively for iii the blank group value no mps or co existing pollutants in the water was included as a reference which was present in all included studies when the value of the combined and single groups was on one side of the blank group e g the value of the combined group was 30 that of the single group 20 and that of the blank group 15 and if the absolute value of the difference between the combined and blank groups was lower than that between the single and blank groups eq 3 was used otherwise eq 4 was used when the values of the combined and single groups were on both sides of the blank group e g the value of the combined group was 30 that of the single group 15 and that of the blank group 20 the value in the combined or single group was first made symmetrical to the value of the blank group the previous value becomes 30 for the combined group 25 for the single group and 20 for the blank group the subsequent use of the equation was consistent with the value on the same side according to hedges g value the degree of influence can be divided into four categories g 0 2 small effect 0 2 g 0 5 medium effect 0 5 g 0 8 large effect and g 0 8 very large effect berlino et al 2021 salerno et al 2021 2 4 data gap filling and categorization according to the specific toxicity data of this study and referring to related studies foley et al 2018 han et al 2022 jacob et al 2020 salerno et al 2021 sun et al 2022b wu and seebacher 2020 toxicity indicators were classified into seven categories including growth and development behavioural sensory and neuromuscular functions immune system metabolism reproduction alimentary and excretory systems and oxidative damage when an indicator had more than one biological implication such as lactate dehydrogenase which not only indicates changes in cellular energy production pathways but also damage to cells and tissues santos et al 2022a it was categorized according to the emphasis by the authors of the specific study jacob et al 2020 table s3 provides a detailed indicator classification subgroup meta regression analysis was conducted to explore influencing factors that affect toxicity changes with the following categorical continuous moderators that may have an impact as confirmed by previous studies bhagat et al 2021 covernton et al 2021 fu et al 2021 huang et al 2021 qiao et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 1 life stage of fish early life stage juvenile and adult larvae and embryos were classified as early life stages because some studies investigated both stages simultaneously for a few studies that did not mention the life stage but mentioned the body to fish growth time relevant literature was referred to determine the life stage as precisely as possible 2 mp type 3 mp size 1 μm and 1 μm this study was focused on comparing the toxicity between nanoplastics and mps nanoplastics are defined as plastic particles 1 μm gigault et al 2018 koelmans et al 2019 or 0 1 μm ng et al 2018 strungaru et al 2019 considering the data amount of nanoplastics 1 μm was chosen as the threshold to make our study more representative 4 co existing pollutant type organic and inorganic pollutants heavy metals the reason for this classification is that the adsorption mechanism of organic and inorganic pollutants on mps differs cao et al 2021 fu et al 2021 hydrophobicity is important in affecting the adsorption of organic pollutants on mps and it can be reflected by logkow li et al 2018 mei et al 2020 organic pollutants with high logkow are more easily absorbed by mps fu et al 2021 the relationship between hydrophobicity and effect value was discussed through meta regression analysis in addition hydrophobicity is important in affecting the enrichment of organic pollutants in organisms wen et al 2012 according to the chinese guidelines for the classification of aquatic environmental hazards gb t 36700 5 2018 if the logkow of organic pollutants is 4 it is considered to have biological enrichment potential therefore the relationship between hydrophobicity and effect values was further discussed using meta regression analysis in two parts with 4 as the dividing line logkow values were first obtained from the united states national library of medicine https chem nlm nih gov chemidplus chemidlite jsp and those not available were supplemented by those available at https www chemsrc com 5 exposure time exposure time and logkow value were continuous moderators and the remaining moderators fish life stage co existing pollutant type and mp type and size were categorical moderators further details are provided in table s1 2 5 statistical analysis as multiple response indicators were extracted from a single study the data may not be independent see section 3 1 for a detailed explanation of the non independence between indicators nakagawa et al 2017 therefore a three level meta analytical model was created to address this problem first different studies were distinguished by author then the data in the same study were composed of groups with different exposure conditions mp concentration type co existing pollutant concentration exposure time and the response indicators of the same group of fish were nested into one group wu and seebacher 2020 salerno et al 2021 a multivariate meta analysis model in r was constructed using the metafor package rma mv to estimate the overall effect size and 95 confidence interval ci for the datasets effect sizes were considered significant if the 95 ci did not overlap with zero salerno et al 2021 for categorical and continuous moderators the effect was considered significant when the p value of the test for moderators was 0 05 publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot egger s regression and the trim and fill method hossain and olden 2022 wu and seebacher 2020 in general without publication bias the drawing would resemble a symmetrical inverted funnel hossain and olden 2022 the funnel plot showed relative asymmetry and was confirmed by egger s test p 0 05 but the significance and direction of the effect values did not change after using the trim and fill method fig s1 thus our results were robust meta analysis data are presented as mean effect size se 3 results and discussion 3 1 presence of mps aggravates toxicity a total of 1380 biological endpoints were obtained from 55 studies the overall effect determined via the multivariate model indicated that mps in co existing pollutant solutions significantly increased the toxicity to fish to a medium extent g 0 30 0 11 p 0 0056 fig 2 the impact of the presence of mps in a solution of co existing pollutants on the toxicity of fish with seven trait categories was focused on the results indicated that there were significant negative effects on the immune system g 0 72 0 14 p 0 0001 metabolism g 0 61 0 14 p 0 0001 and oxidative damage g 0 29 0 13 p 0 02 but no significant effects on growth and development p 0 05 behavioural sensory and neuromuscular functions p 0 05 alimentary and excretory systems p 0 05 and reproduction p 0 05 fish immune systems are very sensitive to exogenous disturbances and changes in innate immunity can be used as early indicators of responses to these disturbances jacob et al 2020 tort 2011 wen et al 2018 additionally many resources are allocated to deal with exogenous disturbances as these can lead to metabolic recombination and disorder santos et al 2022b wen et al 2018 metabolic disorder affects the energy availability of the immune system such as the production of antibodies and protein synthesis which leads to suppression of the immune response tort 2011 due to the high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the plasma membrane of immune cells and high production of reactive oxygen species immune cells are particularly sensitive to oxidative stress and cellular oxidative damage impairs the integrity and function of immune cell membranes cellular protein and nucleic acid knight 2000 yang et al 2020 found that exacerbation of oxidative damage after exposure of ps mps 6 2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate f 53b compared with f 53b enhanced the inflammatory response of zebrafish larvae oxidative damage of cells also interferes with the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates leading to metabolic disorder banaee et al 2019 sheng et al 2021 banaee et al 2019 found that cell membrane damage of common carp cyprinus carpio exposed to mps cadmium changed triglycerides and cholesterol circulating levels simultaneously metabolic changes also affect oxidative damage zhang et al 2022c zhang et al 2022c found that exposure of crucian carp carassius auratus to aging mps roxithromycin changed the metabolism of galactose and affected oxidative damage to fish although the current data showed that the existence of mps in a solution of co existing pollutants had no significant negative impact on the four classifications of fish on a systemic level there was a relationship between different trait classifications of fish metabolic disorders eventually lead to abnormal behavior brun et al 2019 for example when the activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase is inhibited the energy acquisition of fish declines limiting the ability to find food and escape predators oliveira et al 2013 oxidative damage can inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity leading to neurotoxicity banaee et al 2019 moreover under exogenous disturbances the redistribution of energy may be far away from development and reproduction which may have potential later health consequences brun et al 2019 santos et al 2022b therefore the toxicology of combined pollution on fish still needs further attention 3 2 factors influencing toxicity changes 3 2 1 fish there were significant differences between the groups with regard to the life stages of fish p 0 0071 fig 3 mps in co existing pollutant solutions significantly increased the toxicity to adult fish to a large extent g 0 61 0 17 p 0 0004 but had no significant effect on early life stage and juvenile p 0 05 compared with early life stages and juvenile fish adult fish are less sensitive to pollutants due to a perfect homeostasis mechanism and mature immune system beiras et al 2018 liu et al 2012 mohammed 2013 thus it is difficult to reach the tolerance limit and the toxicity changes over a wider range moreover adult fish are more likely to ingest mps which can alter the bioavailability of co existing pollutants and thus toxicity covernton et al 2021 huang et al 2020 considering combined pollution the effects of mps on fish should be a concern at every life stage 3 2 2 co existing pollutants mechanisms of organic pollutant adsorption on mps includes hydrophobicity hydrogen bonds π π bonds van der waals forces and electrostatic interactions bhagat et al 2021 mei et al 2020 while mechanisms of heavy metals adsorption on mps are complexation of cations with the mp surface and repulsion or attraction of charged molecules brennecke et al 2016 cao et al 2021 our results showed no significant differences between organic and inorganic pollutants p 0 05 fig 3 moreover our results showed that there was no correlation between effect values and logkow under the three classifications p 0 05 the distribution of logkow and the corresponding effect values is shown in fig s2 interactive effects of mps and pollutants on fish toxicity are complex and depend not only on the adsorption of pollutants on mps but also on the ingestion of mps and the rate of resolution in the gastrointestinal tract fan et al 2021 ito et al 2022 li et al 2021 ito et al 2022 found that the ability to desorb polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs from polyethylene pe mps differed in the digestive tract of two fish species red seabream and mummichog with different structures 3 2 3 microplastics the type size shape colour and aging of mps can affect the adsorption of co existing pollutants and their uptake by fish mei et al 2020 mo et al 2021 the experimental data collected were almost identical for mps with regard to shape sphere or particle colour white grey and surface property original thus only mp type and size were studies different types of mps have different densities which affect their distribution in water layers and consequently different contact opportunities with fish ma et al 2020 in addition different types of mps differ in their ability to absorb pollutants due to differences in functional groups and polarity fu et al 2021 however there was no significant difference between groups with changes in fish toxicity p 0 05 fig 3 most of the included studies used ps k 980 while very few studies used other types whose effects may therefore be under represented our results revealed significant differences between mp sizes 1 μm and 1 μm p 0 0293 fig 3 the presence of mps 1 μm had a significant effect g 0 60 0 18 p 0 0008 while that of 1 μm mps had no significant effect p 0 05 this is because the smaller the mps the easier they can be ingested by fish and enter their tissues he et al 2021 singh et al 2021 additionally smaller particles have a larger specific surface area than larger particles and can adsorb more co existing pollutants thereby exhibiting greater toxicity qiao et al 2019 mo et al 2021 qiao et al 2019 found that 0 1 μm mps significantly increased copper adsorption and bioaccumulation in zebrafish compared to 20 μm mps which aggravated intestine and liver toxicity 3 2 4 exposure time another aim of this study was to determine whether the impact of mps in co existing pollutants solutions on fish were correlated with exposure time our results showed no correlation p 0 05 fish have a stronger stress response at the beginning of changes in the external environment but organisms can actively adapt to their environment and may undergo a series of physiological changes to gradually adapt over time cheng et al 2012 sun et al 2022b zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 reported that exposing red tilapia oreochromis niloticus to mps roxithromycin for two weeks showed roxithromycin peaking at 3 6 days in different organs which then gradually decreased and the effect was more obvious at high concentrations this may be due to the low intake and high excretion during late stages of exposure undoubtedly there is a possibility that increases in exposure time may let the fish defence system collapse altering the original trend of changes in response indicators li et al 2022b sun et al 2021 3 3 limitations our study is a meta analysis of laboratory data with the aim of further understanding the impact of mps on organisms by the combined pollution of mps and co existing pollutants however the current work has certain limitations 1 differences in mps between the laboratory and actual environment mps used in the laboratory are relatively uniform the type is mainly ps the shape is mainly spherical and granular the colour is mainly white grey the surface property is mainly original and there is a limited number of studies on millimetre scales whereas mps in the actual environment are complex and diverse these factors affect the adsorption and desorption behaviour of co existing pollutants or the ingestion of fish or intestinal retention time jabeen et al 2017 mei et al 2020 mo et al 2021 sun et al 2022b yang et al 2022 moreover mps form biofilms in the actual environment which affects the adsorption of co existing pollutants zhang et al 2022a 2 differences in co existing pollutants between the laboratory and actual environment usually only one co existing pollutant is used in the laboratory but various pollutants are found in the environment at the same time and competitive adsorption exists in the actual environment additionally the concentration in the laboratory is higher than that in the actual environment 3 difference in environmental factors between the laboratory and actual environments temperature salinity ph ionic strength and natural organic substances fluctuate in the actual environment which affects the adsorption and desorption behavior of mps which is not the case under stable conditions during laboratory experiments fu et al 2021 in addition the body condition and indicators of fish are greatly affected by temperature fonte et al 2016 kratina et al 2019 4 difference in experimental objects between the laboratory and actual environments the fish used in the laboratory are mainly zebrafish although some studies use other species of fish they remain limited compared with the species in the actual environment different fish species may result in different experimental results due to differences in environmental adaptability habitat feeding habits and intestinal structure jabeen et al 2017 huang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 in summary further studies should address such discrepancies between research conducted under laboratory and natural environmental conditions 4 conclusions a meta analysis was performed to demonstrate that the presence of mps in co existing pollutant solutions significantly increases toxicity to fish under the background of environmental mp concentration mps increase negative effects on the immune system metabolism and oxidative damage but not on growth and development behavioral sensory and neuromuscular functions alimentary and excretory systems and reproduction subgroup analysis indicated that changes in toxicity were related to the fish life stage and mp size but not to co existing pollutant or mp type meta regression analysis indicated that changes in toxicity were not related to logkow or exposure time finally differences between laboratory research and actual aquatic environment were discussed from four aspects mps co existing pollutants environmental factors and experimental objects these differences may compromise assessment accuracy and warrant further research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

and compositions of microbial communities encoding functional gene phod were also obtained using high throughput sequencing the results showed that po concentrations remarkably increased from winter toward spring when having higher water depths due to the terrigenous input and biomass deposition noteworthy elevation in the po4 3 concentration was observed in the interstitial water during the spring particularly at around 5 cm sediment depth with value reaching as high as 0 43 mg l the degradation and mineralization of momoesters and diesters with higher concentrations in the sediments of spring aggravated the po4 3 load in the interstitial water higher apa reaching 91 6 μg g h in spring was responsible for the mineralization of po remarkably upwards increasing of absolute abundance of phod encoding gene in spring reaching up to 2 6 times of that in winter facilitated the generation of apa in spring cobetia and calothrix followed by aquabacterium and mitsuaria were the most abundant phod encoding genera with relative abundance 4 weakly positive correlation between dominant bacterial genera and apa and p fractions suggested that low abundance genera was also involved in the apa generation and po hydrolysis these results indicate that spring with high water temperature and depth facilitate the mineralization of po in the sediment and increase of labile po4 3 load in the water

discharged into the lakes and deposited into the sediment via river and runoff input due to the anthropogenic activities around the lakes sediment is both the major p pool and source in lake systems

the turnover and release of orthophosphate po4 3 from particulate p in the sediment except for external sources of p ahlgren et al 2006 albright et al 2022 water temperature was considered as the key environmental variable on p cycle at the water sediment interface of lakes jiang et al 2008 the release of soluble reactive p srp in the sediment varied seasonally in four shallow eutrophic lakes due

environments on apa and p regeneration is still limited p cycle in the aquatic environments is highly driven by the activity of diverse microorganism groups campos et al 2022 microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems can convert po into labile p fractions via excretion of extracellular enzymes and thus may influence the p release from sediments godwin and cotner 2015 kinsman costello et al 2017 the functional genes regulating the expression of specific enzymes have been widely used in the studies about p cycle at present three apase encoding gene families including phod phoa and phox have been identified in freshwater ecosystems zimmerman et al 2013 campos et al 2021 higher abundance of phod than phoa and phox in aquatic ecosystems indicated that it could be used as a key functional marker for diversity and distribution of apase harboring microbial communities zhang et al 2020 the occurrence of phod encoding genes which linked to apase in bacterial communities were reported to closely relate to p transformation in freshwater ecosystems sebastian and ammerman 2009 wan et al 2020 yin et al 2023 the research of chen et al 2017 found that apa was positively regulated by phod gene abundance in addition qin et al 2020 verified that water depth variation could influence the p reduction processes and regulate p dynamics effectively in lakes the change of environmental factors including water depth and temperature can accordingly regulate the balance between the mineralization degree and phod gene which potentially controls the eutrophic level of aquatic environments in the recent studies the literatures about reactive p regeneration and replenishment in the water sediment systems generally focused on p cycling which were controlled by inorganic parameters however the research about the influence of abundance of phod encoding microorganisms and processes of enzymatic reactions about p cycle driven by transseasonal temperature variation in lake systems are still limited and should be paid more attention the regulation effect of microorganisms on po decomposition for fueling reactive p in the lake systems at varied season is still rare given the importance of po the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the variation of different p fractions and apa in sediments via shift of seasons of a representative eutrophic lake 2 quantity the abundance and microbial diversity of phod encoding gene in the sediment under changed hydrological condition using high throughput sequencing and 3 clarify the influence degree of phod encoding bacteria communities on p regeneration and lease of the lake sediments controlled by seasonal water temperature and depth changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and processing two groups of sediment core

the lake obtained in different sampling sites and seasons were plotted in fig s1 water temperatures remarkably increased from less than 10 c in winter to about 27 c in spring and more than 30 c in summer in all sites respectively the water depths of overlying water in winter 2021 were less than 0 5 cm and remarkably raised to about 3 0 cm in spring 2022 the water depth dramatically decreased to less than 0 5 m again due to the extreme high temperature and deficiency runoff input for long time in the summer of 2022 in the watershed lower do concentrations were detected in spring than that in winter and summer increasing concentrations of tp and po4 3 in the overlying water were simultaneously detected from winter to summer higher chla concentrations with the maximum value reaching up to 41 4 μg l were measured in spring than that in winter and summer similarly incremental toc concentrations in the overlying water were also found from winter to summer 3 2 change of p fractions in sediments the p fractions on the solid sediment profiles in varied seasons with different water temperatures and depths were portrayed in fig 2 the concentrations of tp in the sediments ranged from 320 4 to 937 8 mg kg the values didn t show remarkably consistent variation on the whole columns collected in winter and summer except the deep layer of core c2 in winter having distinct increase slight decrease was found on sediment profiles in spring for the tp concentrations the similar change trends were detected for pi concentrations in the sediment cores from different sites and seasons which varied between 172 0 and 896 9 mg kg lower po concentrations were measured from 108 3 to 230 1 mg kg with the highest values found in spring the sediments collected in winter with the lowest temperature and water depth had the lowest po concentrations and relative stable values on the whole sediment profiles slight downward decline of po was detected in sediment column in summer noted that po concentrations remarkably decreased downwards to less than half on the all sediment profiles in spring with the highest water depths fig 2 also displayed the varied distribution of ionic po4 3 concentrations in interstitial water of sediments with 10 cm depth under the water sediment interface obtained using hr peeper technique for different sampling sites and seasons the highest values of 0 43 mg l were detected in spring with the high water levels compared to other two seasons the values downwards increased from the sediment surface to deeper layer at approximate 5 cm depth following distinctly decline to the bottom layer with low value of approximate 0 07 mg l the po4 3 concentrations kept the relatively stable and low values at 0 01 0 08 mg l on the whole profiles in winter and summer with radically different water temperatures and similarly low water depths the solution 31p nmr spectra for specific sediment layers obtained from varied seasons are displayed and classified in fig s2 po components and concentrations were also listed in table s1 total po concentrations in the extracts varied from 13 60 to 20 43 mg kg in all sediment layers at different sampling times the identification of specific po compounds refers to cade menun 2005 and backnäs et al 2012 the spectra area varying from 5 7 to 7 ppm were separated and quantified remarkable peaks at 6 2 5 ppm were classified to monoesters with ratio accounting for 0 04 0 30 of total po diesters with chemical shift values at approximate 11 ppm were surveyed and assigned as dna po with ratio occupying 0 02 0 18 of total po which are normally lower than monoesters chemical shift at about 4 5 ppm was only found at the upper layer of the sediment core obtained in winter and attributed to pyrophosphate generally higher po components including monoesters and diesters were detected in sediments obtained in spring relative to that in winter and summer 3 3 variation of apa and enzyme kinetic parameters the apa concentrations and enzyme kinetic parameters including vmax and km were plotted in fig 3 relatively low apa values were found in solid sediments in spring varying from 25 9 to 47 0 μg g h the values didn t show the remarkable change on the whole profiles in all research sites as well as the sedimentary depths remarkable increase of apa on the whole columns in all sites ranging from 40 3 to 91 6 μg g h were detected in spring with higher water temperatures and levels the highest apa values were found at approximate 5 cm depth following the decrease until the bottom of the sediment cores the apa values generally higher than that in winter but lower than that in spring were also surveyed in summer with values varying between 32 2 and 63 9 μg g h when having the highest water temperatures higher vmax values of apa were found in winter and spring with the lowest and the highest water depth respectively which reaching up to approximately 287 0 μg g h in spring decline of vmax less than 121 7 μg g h were found in the sediment in summer with the highest water temperature and the low water depth generally higher vmax were found at deeper sediment layers in all sampling sites in addition the highest km values were found in winter having the lowest water temperature with the highest value than 60 μg l in site c3 noteworthy decline of km values were detected in site c3 however the lowest km values less than 10 7 μg l were found in the sediment obtained in summer finally the similar change trends of vmax km values were found in sites c1 and c2 in all sampling seasons remarkably downwards decline were detected in winter and spring conversely the vmax km values generally increased from the top sediment layers toward the bottom layers in the summer 3 4 absolute abundance of functional genes in sediment cores fig 3 also displayed the variation of absolute abundance of p harboring functional gene phod in solid sediment columns in different research areas during the varied seasons distinct abundances of phod gene were detected at the different depths and sites of sediment cores and varied from 1 68 to 2 85 106 copies g dw at the whole sediment profiles in winter remarkable increase of phod gene absolute abundances were observed at 1 45 3 77 106 copies g dw in the spring sediment noted that downwards decline of absolute abundances of phod gene were found toward the bottom layers in winter in three sediment cores obtained in spring finally in summer with the highest water temperature the absolute abundance of phod gene downwards decreased with mean values from 0 08 to 1 07 106 copies g dw from the top to the bottom layers at the three sampling sites remarkable decrease were found at sites c2 and c3 3 5 diversity and changes of phod gene community the phod encoding functional gene communities for p cycle in specific sediment depths u m and b layers from different seasons were analyzed by using functional gene sequencing fig 4 based on out clustering and classification in winter total 515 931 580 702 high quality sequences for phod gene were obtained from the sample matrix and clustered into 1878 2082 otus based on 97 species similarity total 156 947 357 906 and 707 038 1100 564 high quality sequences were gotten for phod harboring gene in spring and summer 151 372 343 648 and 523 644 700 917 otus were also obtained in spring and summer based on species similarity of 97 respectively the clustering analysis of diversity of species composition based on outs showed that the predominant bacterial communities in the sediment cores at genus level had varied relative abundance 4 of total otus at different seasons fig 4a gene communities were slightly different along the depth gradient of the sediments and the change of seasons bacteria cobetia had the highest abundance 25 22 0 77 as genus phod at the whole sediment profile in all sampling seasons followed by calothrix 18 91 1 40 aquabacterium 5 39 0 95 and mitsuaria 4 63 0 51 bacteria cobetia dominated the highest abundance 25 43 4 40 as phod harboring gene at the sediment columns followed by calothrix 18 77 0 31 aquabacterium 5 84 0 65 and mitsuaria 4 15 0 53 for dominant gene cobetia the upper layer of sediment had the lower abundance than deeper sediment layer generally noteworthy shift of predominant bacterial communities was found in the sediment cores in varied seasons with different water depth and temperature the relatively rare gene with relative abundance less than 4 of total otus didn t display the remarkable difference in the sediment cores fig 4b at varied water depths and temperatures venn analysis indicated that a total of 1229 otus existed in both sediments for phod genes for all seasons fig 5 a total of 1634 otus existed in both sediment layers u m and b for phod encoding gene generally higher out sizes were found at upper layer in all sampling seasons and lower out sizes were obtained for sediments in spring having deeper water depth relative to other sampling times the ecological network based on the otu matrix was constructed to explore the potential intraspecific mechanism and co occurrence characteristics of bacterial community based on strong significant correlations p 0 05 at genus level fig 5b cladogram fig s3 clearly displayed the difference of dominant taxa in the sediments from varied seasons the network for phod gene had 67 nodes and 377 edges with density 0 085 and average clustering coefficient 0 243 based on the modularity class the network of phod gene in the sediments could be clarified to 5 modules with modularity resolution of 0 382 the lefse algorithm detected 10 8 and 10 differentially dominant taxonomic clades as active biomarkers in winter spring and summer sediments respectively fig 5c noted that majority of these representative differentially abundant bacterial taxa presented with high lda scores lda 2 such as burkholdriales and betaproteobacteria generally possessed lower relative abundance than dominant genera mentioned above including cobetia and calothrix with relative abundance higher than 4 the diversity indices based on outs numbers including chao1 ace and shannon reduced from winter to spring following increase to summer fig 6 a generally the lowest diversity indices were observed in spring simpson indice displayed contrary tendency with winter having the highest values the significant differentiation among sample groups was also identified using pca pcoa nmds and pls da fig 6b analysis based on otu compositions for different sediment depth the highest diversity indices including chao1 ace and shannon were detected in upper layer compared to deeper sediments fig 6b the lowest diversity indices were detected in summer having the highest water temperature fig 6a the β diversity indices including pca pcoa nmds and pls da analysis for phod gene based on otus in sediment from different seasons displayed the obvious clusters and dispersion among the sampling times 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of p fractions in the sediment similar variation trends were found for tp and pi concentrations in sediment columns in different sampling time significantly positive correlation r 0 74 p 0 01 were detected between tp and pi concentration fig 7 a suggesting pi was the important tp compositions in the sediments higher po concentrations at upper 10 cm depth in spring and summer indicated the po accumulation at the water sediment interface in addition the decrease downwards from the interface to the bottom layer suggested the mineralization of po under aerobic anaerobic scenarios in higher water temperature similar downwards decrease along the depth gradient was also detected in erken lake ahlgren et al 2005 significantly positive correlation coefficient r 0 86 p 0 01 were also detected between tp and po concentration suggesting po could simultaneously influence the occurrence of tp in the sediments even possessing relatively lower concentrations than pi positive correlation coefficient r 0 65 p 0 05 between po and srp in the interstitial water suggested that po in the solid sediments was the important potential source of srp which is labile and can be digested by microorganisms higher concentrations of individual po compounds including monoesters and diesters were found in the sediments of spring indicating the import and accumulation of these biogenic po species in the sediments at the scenario with high water depth and temperatures higher po concentrations in the suspended particulate matter were also surveyed in lake chaohu china in spring indicating the contribution of runoff input yang et al 2020 reduced runoff input via river due to the extreme high temperature in the summer 2022 was speculated to be responsible for the decrease of monoesters and diesters concentrations in the sediments the largest identified biogenic p compound group in all sites and times was monoesters which were also measured in other lakes worldwide ahlgren et al 2006 bai et al 2009 shinohara et al 2012 liu et al 2016 sedimentary monoesters and diesters may be produced by algae macrophytes and microbes and they might also be introduced from the input of terrestrial sources liu et al 2009 dramatic decline of dna po was detected in the sediments in the summer when the water depth decreased this suggested the degradation of this po fraction in high temperature and do without the overlaying of exogenous input of po through the riverine discharge higher monoesters and diesters concentrations were also detected in a eutrophic brackish water lake in chile in summer sediments than that in winter sediments campos et al 2022 diesters were more labile than monoesters and were speculated to preferentially utilized by microbes resulting to the decrease of diester concentrations in sediments pant and reddy 2001 makarov et al 2005 darch et al 2014 additionally higher diesters monoesters ratios 0 74 0 17 in spring indicated that monoesters underwent more substantial transformation during the sedimentation in the episode with higher water depth than in both winter and summer with ratios of 0 51 0 05 and 0 56 0 20 respectively shinohara et al 2012 4 2 linkages between apa and phod gene abundance most microorganisms related in po degradation are heterotrophs and utilize organic c to generate extracellular enzymes and promote the p availability bi et al 2020 chen et al 2022 higher cyanophyta biomass manifested as chla in overlying water and po4 3 concentrations in interstitial water were detected in spring having higher apa values suggesting the increase of apa enhanced the release of srp from sediments and fueled the primary productivity in the lake water wang et al 2012 the p contained in the microorganisms such as cyanophyta existing as po can serve as metabolic substrate for p mineralization to regulate apa hu et al 2018 apa was considered an inducible enzyme which could be regulated by the ambient pi level hoppe 2003 that is apa was improved under the po4 3 deficient condition and suppressed when po4 3 concentrations were high chróst and overbeck 1987 however pandey and yadav 2017 found that apa in the sediments didn t fluctuate with the changes of pi availability indicating the complicated correlations among apa and pi in the natural environments remarkably positive correlation were simultaneously detected between apa and po and srp concentrations r 0 97 and 0 79 p 0 01 and 0 05 respectively fig 7a and fig s4a b this manifested that apa could promote the hydrolysis of po and raise the pi concentrations in the water when po concentration was higher in the hotter seasons significantly positive correlations between monoesters diesters and srp were also found in the sediments fig 7a verified that srp was supplemented via the mineralization of monoesters and diesters in the sediments through the apa hydrolysis biogenic monoesters and diesters can be hydrolyzed into more labile pi forms by microbial enzymatic activity such as bacterial phosphomonoesterases pases under the alkaline circumstance torres et al 2014 ma et al 2019 vmax represented the catalytic velocity of the apase that is the stronger catalytic ability of enzyme displayed the higher vmax the km represents the affinity of an enzyme complex and a substrate lower km values mean higher affinity xie et al 2010 high vmax were found in spring showed the higher catalytic ability in the sediments under the conditions of higher water temperature and depth vmax were also found in spring in taihu lake with po4 3 concentrations of 0 011 0 020 mg gao et al 2006 higher apa values observed in seasons with higher temperatures suggested that the apa increased with temperature which was consistent with some previous studies persson et al 2011 differently donghu lake in china had elevated vmax values in winter with higher po4 3 concentrations reaching up to 0 3 mg l zhou et al 2002 this was consistent with the relatively higher apa and vmax than summer observed in spring sediments in this research suggesting that water depth exerted stronger influence on catalytic ability of apa in the sediments than temperature lower km values in summer than that in winter and spring could be attributed to the stronger affinity on the condition of low po4 3 concentrations however this didn t bring about the stronger enzyme hydrolysis of po in the high temperatures the vmax km values were considered to be able to characterize the catalytic efficiency of apase in the sediment systems huang and shindo 2000 xie et al 2010 raised vmax km values downwards were measured in the sediment profiles with the increase of water temperatures and po4 3 concentrations in the interstitial water fig 3 remarkable difference were found in the obtained sediment cores in varied sampling times which performed as downwards reducing vmax km values in sites c1 and c3 and raising values in site c2 with the highest solid po values and po4 3 concentrations in the interstitial water this result partly conflicted with the discovery of xie et al 2010 which concluded that vmax km deceased with the increase of po4 3 concentrations in sludge vmax km was proved to be debatable to act as a good indicator of catalytic efficiency of apa in the lake sediments even weakly positive correlation coefficient was found between vmax km and apa values as well as srp concentrations bacteria contain large amounts of diesters which may increase the dna p concentrations during sedimentation and alter the composition of p groups in the sediment reitze et al 2012 higher toc concentrations were observed in the overlying water in spring together with the significantly positive correlations between toc and p fractions tp pi and po fig s4c testifying the accumulation of p containing organism residues in spring relative to winter and summer with low water levels higher apa along with vmax values in spring indicated the strengthening mineralization of diesters which induced the accumulation of monoesters in the sediments on the condition of higher water temperature and depth this was further evidenced by the decrease of dna po concentrations in summer meaning the rapid mineralization and depletion of dna po as well the accumulation of po4 3 in the interstitial water similar degradation of dna po and accumulation of monoesters were also found in sediment in lake nordborg dnmark with seasons from spring to summer reitzel et al 2012 significantly positive correlations were found among apa and monoesters as well as diesters fig 7a further affirming the strong enzymatic hydrolysis degree of diesters to monoesters in higher temperatures 4 3 phod gene regulates the apa in the sediments the phod functional gene was the most common apa gene and has been widely employed to act as a genetic marker to explore po mineralization capacity in natural environments wan et al 2020 apa was closely related to the community composition and abundance of phod encoding bacteria wang et al 2022 in this study absolute abundances of phod gene markedly downwards increased with the promotion of apa values until approximate 5 cm sediment depths when temperature raised fig 3 however significantly positive correlation was not detected between absolute abundance of phod functional gene and apa fig 7a in the sediments remarkably increasing po4 3 concentrations in the interstitial water and phod gene as well as apa values were simultaneously measured at approximate 5 cm depths in all sites this meant the acceleration of apase generation from microorganisms and mineralization of po in the solid sediments especially under the episodes of higher water temperatures and depths this synergistic effect was not reinforced in summer with relatively low phod absolute abundances and apa along with low po4 3 concentrations which potentially suggesting that high water depth rather than water temperature facilitated the apa intensify induced by phod encoding gene this was also testified by the higher apa values obtained in the sediments in spring and summer having raised temperatures noted that upwards decreasing apa values were found in the sediment columns along with the reducing po4 3 concentrations even though the absolute abundances of phod gene continuously increased until the water sediment interface layer especially in spring and summer different variations of apa in the sediments were found in lake donghu zhou et al 2001 lake taihu and lake kinneret hadas and pinkas 1997 zhang et al 2007 which generally downwards increased and decreased with the change of sediment depths respectively we speculated that some specific bacteria which encoded phod gene existing in the deeper sediment layers promoted the generation of apase on the aerobic condition especially in spring higher bacterial biomass in the sediment was detected in higher temperature qian et al 2011 positive correlation between apa producing bacteria and apa was found in the sediment of lake of constance jansson et al 1988 indicating the potential enrichment of phod encoding bacteria in deeper sediment layers when apa values were high in donghu lake and this work zhou et al 2001 however identifying the predominant phod harboring gene was important for the clarifying the mineralization path of po in the sediments and supplementary mechanism of labile srp for overlying water 4 4 dominant phod gene actuates the p activity in the sediments noteworthy changes in the composition and interaction of bacteria community may affect the functions of bacteria communities in the environments cobetia was the most abundant phod encoding genera with relative abundances higher than 15 before and after experiencing the temperature shift calothrix following by aquabacterium and mitsuaria in the sediment profiles from the selected sampling sites also had relatively high abundances higher relative abundances of cobetia were detected at deeper sediment layers which showed the higher absolute abundances of phod gene fig 3 indicating that cobetia was the dominant contributor of phod encoding community involved in po cycle in the sediments noted that the cobetia didn t display remarkably higher abundances in spring when higher water temperatures and depths occurred it was speculated that some rare phod harboring bacterial communities worked together and balanced the phod gene amounts in the sediments in varied episodes with different water depths and temperatures the zi within module connectivity and pi among module connectivity plot fig 7b showed that most nodes were peripherals 52 2 following connectors 47 8 and no node was in module hubs and network hubs the group of otus nodes in connectors quadrant were highly connected within a module or multiple modules which were defined as keystone species in the research regions guimera and amaral 2005 deng et al 2012 cobetia and calothrix were in connectors and considered as key genera however relatively more nodes fallen into connectors in the network than other aquatic environments indicated that rare phod encoding genera except cobetia and calothrix also played important role between modules and contributed to the apa generation chen et al 2022 these rare phod encoding genera were speculated to be responsible for the high phod harboring gene abundance in the spring the ecological network showed that there were only 24 9 and 9 0 lines for phod gene showed positive and negative correlation between the connected nodes respectively indicating the modules were separated pang and ji 2019 the genera cylindrospermum skermanella methylobacterium xanthomonas and labilithrix had the maximum connected degree of 25 22 22 21 and 21 respectively cobetia and calothrix had only 3 and 2 connected degrees it s worth noting that the aforementioned bacteria of phod gene with the high node degree in network were the keystone species with larger relative abundances than any others the most connected species for phod gene was sulfuritalea linked to different modules with high average degree low betweenness centrality and high closeness centrality and relative abundances and were identified as key genera we further speculated that the occurrence of some rare genes with low abundance is detrimental for p cycle in the sediments in varied seasons generally higher edges and nodes indicated that phod gene than other genera species dominated the bacterial community in the lake sediments lefse can be used to distinguish the predominant species in various bacterial communities and to elucidate the biologically differential bacteria among various microbiota zhang et al 2018 the lefse indicated that some rare populations played key roles in determining the bacterial community structure which encoding phod gene in the sediments additionally these biomarkers were differentiated among the seasons indicating the shift of species of the microbiota with the regulation of water temperatures and levels in varied seasons generally higher lda scores along with higher relative abundance of dominant genera including xanthomonas suggested that these microbial communities predominantly contributed to the stronger abundance and activities of pod encoding bacteria communities in spring this speculation was further testified by metastats heatmap analysis which showed that genus acidovorax had the highest relative abundance of 4 96 and lda of 4 2 in spring sediments fig 5d p 0 05 the analysis of β diversity indices suggested the occurrence of bacteria communities with varied abundance in different seasons further regulating the absolute abundance and enzyme hydrolysis function of phod gene in different episodes in addition lower α diversity indices including chao1 ace and shannon and higher simpson indice detected in spring compared to winter and summer indicated the low community richness which encoded functional phod gene in the sediments fig 6a however higher absolute abundances existing in season spring fig 4a confirmed that some specific genera in total bacterial community including dominant species and biomarkers with relatively low abundance contributed to the remarkably abundant phod gene in the sediments in the scenario of deeper water depth 4 5 environmental influencers of phod encoding bacterial community the pearson s correlation analysis between bacterium species generating phod functional gene and environment factors was illustrated in fig s5 similar to some previous studies proteobacteria and cyanobacteria were the predominant phod encoding bacteria in the lake sediment at phylum level lagos et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2022 table s2 however cobetia and calothrix as the dominant phod harboring functional gene which affiliated to these phyla generally didn t display the significant correlation with the environment factors including various po fractions and apase dynamic parameters genera aquabacterium and mitsuaria which affiliated to proteobacteria had the significantly positive correlation with spr in the overlying water and vmax in the sediments additionally significantly positive correlation were also detected between herbaspirillum with extreme low abundance in the sediments and po as well as apa values similarly rare genera acidovorax and xanthomonas with relative abundance less than 4 5 also showed the significantly positive correlation with spr and vmax positive correlations were also found between some specific taxa such as comamonas and po fractions including monoesters these findings suggested that environment factors didn t induce the linear regulation of predominant bacteria communities in the sediments however the important environment factors including po fractions and apase dynamic parameters can drive the fluctuation of some genera having low relative abundance and then trigger the mineralization of po compounds and srp release from the solid sediment toward the water redundancy analysis rda was plotted in fig 7c to evaluate the influence of environment variables on phod harboring bacterial communities on varied conditions zhao et al 2020 different p factions extracted with edta naoh and po compounds were omitted after redundancy removal the result showed that vmax was the most critical environmental driver p 0 05 with rda1 value of 1 48 among the total variation in the phod encoding bacterial genera the apa remarkably positively correlated with po and spr in sediment and interstitial water fig 7a positive correlation was also observed between srp and vmax values that is apa could drive the release and accumulation of srp through po mineralization in the sediment systems in the lake campos et al 2022 in addition positive correlations were observed between environment factors including po and apa and bacterial genera such as cobetia methylomonas scytonema cupriavidus and acidovorax further suggesting abundant and rare phod harboring genera simultaneously determined phod gene abundance in the sediments this was speculated to be responsible for the weak correlation between α diversity indices and environment factors fig 7d finally stronger coupling relationship between environment factors and bacteria species encoding phod gene were found in spring indicating higher water depth facilitated and accelerated the mineralization of po in the lake sediment and potentially fueled the eutrophication of lake conclusions in the present study we investigated the po mineralization processess influenced by phod encoding microorganisms in the lake sediments after experiencing the transition of water temperatures and depths the transseasonal p fractions and phod encoding gene bacterial communities in lake water sediment ecosystem were explored using varied sequential extracting procedures and high throughput sequencing technique po concentrations remarkably increased in spring and summer due to the terrigenous input and biomass deposition the degradation and mineralization of monoesters and diesters with higher concentrations and ratios accounting for total po in the sediments in spring having higher water depth was the non negligible source of labile po4 3 in the interstitial water in the sediments additionally stronger apa in spring was responsible for the mineralization of po in spring remarkably increasing of absolute abundance of phod encoding gene in spring from the bottom to top sediment layers facilitated the generation of apase from microorganisms noted that apa decreased from approximate 5 cm depth from the interface suggesting the specific phod harboring gene bacterial community restrained the apa even the phod gene absolute abundance continuously increased upwards cobetia and calothrix followed by aquabacterium and mitsuaria were the most abundant phod encoding genera having relative abundance higher than 4 in the sediment experiencing the temperature shift weakly positive correlation between dominant bacterial genera and apa and p fractions suggesting that rare genera was also involved in the apa generation and po hydrolysis in the sediment generally higher water depth rather than temperature in spring promotes the adjustment of apa and mineralization of po in the sediment and further increases of labile po4 3 load in the lake water declaration of

14732,excessive phosphorus p enrichment is the critical cause of eutrophication in the lake water organic p po mineralization processes induced by alkaline phosphatase apase regulated by phod encoding microorganisms in the lake ecosystems was still ambiguous due to the transseasonal shift of water temperatures and depths different p pools in the water and sediments of shijiuhu lake at varied seasons were measured using chemical extraction methods and solution 31p nmr the alkaline phosphatase activity apa in the sediments were assessed together with enzyme kinetic parameters the abundances and compositions of microbial communities encoding functional gene phod were also obtained using high throughput sequencing the results showed that po concentrations remarkably increased from winter toward spring when having higher water depths due to the terrigenous input and biomass deposition noteworthy elevation in the po4 3 concentration was observed in the interstitial water during the spring particularly at around 5 cm sediment depth with value reaching as high as 0 43 mg l the degradation and mineralization of momoesters and diesters with higher concentrations in the sediments of spring aggravated the po4 3 load in the interstitial water higher apa reaching 91 6 μg g h in spring was responsible for the mineralization of po remarkably upwards increasing of absolute abundance of phod encoding gene in spring reaching up to 2 6 times of that in winter facilitated the generation of apa in spring cobetia and calothrix followed by aquabacterium and mitsuaria were the most abundant phod encoding genera with relative abundance 4 weakly positive correlation between dominant bacterial genera and apa and p fractions suggested that low abundance genera was also involved in the apa generation and po hydrolysis these results indicate that spring with high water temperature and depth facilitate the mineralization of po in the sediment and increase of labile po4 3 load in the water

sequencing phod gene bacterial community season shift data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as limited factor of eutrophication phosphorus p is critical macronutrient for aquatic organisms and plays substantial role in the proliferation of primary productivity in aquatic ecosystems including lakes schelske 2009 hellweger et al 2022 fink et al 2018 extensive p was discharged into the lakes and deposited into the sediment via river and runoff input due to the anthropogenic activities around the lakes sediment is both the major p pool and source in lake systems and remarkably affects water quality due to the endogenous release of p even though the external p is restored bhattacharya et al 2022 primary production in the aquatic environments is dependent on the turnover and release of orthophosphate po4 3 from particulate p in the sediment except for external sources of p ahlgren et al 2006 albright et al 2022 water temperature was considered as the key environmental variable on p cycle at the water sediment interface of lakes jiang et al 2008 the release of soluble reactive p srp in the sediment varied seasonally in four shallow eutrophic lakes due to the change of water temperature jensen and andersen 1992 understanding how p desorption and release from solid sediment into water with the change of seasons is critical for eutrophication management of lakes and attract the attention worldwide phosphorus p can be presented as diverse organic po and inorganic pi forms or complexed with fulvic and humic compounds into the sedimentary organic matter om of lakes campos et al 2022 po was often considered to have a similar magnitude as pi and important in many aquatic ecosystems turner et al 2006 ni et al 2022a the po including phospholipids nucleic acids sugar phosphates and inositol phosphates is also a vital source of p in the lake sediments zhu et al 2013 the investigation executed by ding et al 2010 proposed that po concentrations occupying 12 42 0 of total p tp in the sediments in 43 lakes in china solution 31p nuclear magnetic resonance 31p nmr spectroscopy technique which has been widely applied for sediments and soils identified po compounds as several functional groups including orthophosphate monoesters orthophosphate diesters and phosphonate cade menun et al 2006 shinohara et al 2012 reitzel et al 2012 yang et al 2020 ni et al 2022b p containing esters in the sediments can be selectively mineralized and thus decline during sedimentation of organic particles ahlgren et al 2005 biogenic p including all po compound groups can liberate po4 3 to the interstitial water and overlying water from solid sediments through mineralization under varied redox conditions shinohara et al 2012 thereinto orthophosphate monoesters include sugar phosphates and degradation products from phospholipids normally accounted for the higher concentrations than other po compounds and deserve the more attention to the biogeochemical cycles in labile p regeneration in the lacustrine ecosystems hupfer and rübe et al 2004 ahlgren et al 2006 liu et al 2009 phosphomonoesterases can hydrolyze po and play key role in the po cycling and consequent phosphate release in the aquatic environments duhamel et al 2011 alkaline phosphatase apase produced by a majority of microorganisms including phytoplankton and bacteria are enzyme that can hydrolyze various po compounds such as orthophosphate monoesters into po4 3 under phosphate depletion conditions wang et al 2012 mackey et al 2007 nevertheless duhamel et al 2011 proposed that many po compounds can be used as p source even under p sufficient microbial growth via apase hydrolysis hernández et al 1993 concluded that it was hard to establish reliable relationship between p compounds and alkaline phosphatase activity apa in eutrophic lakes apa in sediments can be influenced by many factors including water quality po4 3 concentration and temperature in lake sediments zhou et al 2002 the survey of jamet et al 1997 didn t display distinct correlation between the soluble p and apa via seasonal changes the investigation of zhang et al 2020 showed that apa values in suspended particles in taihu lake increased more than three fold from june to september higher apa was also detected in the sediments in a eutrophic lake in chile campos et al 2022 generally apa is a good indicator of the degree of labile p regeneration in aquatic sediments however the understanding about the regulatory mechanism and processes of microorganism in aquatic environments on apa and p regeneration is still limited p cycle in the aquatic environments is highly driven by the activity of diverse microorganism groups campos et al 2022 microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems can convert po into labile p fractions via excretion of extracellular enzymes and thus may influence the p release from sediments godwin and cotner 2015 kinsman costello et al 2017 the functional genes regulating the expression of specific enzymes have been widely used in the studies about p cycle at present three apase encoding gene families including phod phoa and phox have been identified in freshwater ecosystems zimmerman et al 2013 campos et al 2021 higher abundance of phod than phoa and phox in aquatic ecosystems indicated that it could be used as a key functional marker for diversity and distribution of apase harboring microbial communities zhang et al 2020 the occurrence of phod encoding genes which linked to apase in bacterial communities were reported to closely relate to p transformation in freshwater ecosystems sebastian and ammerman 2009 wan et al 2020 yin et al 2023 the research of chen et al 2017 found that apa was positively regulated by phod gene abundance in addition qin et al 2020 verified that water depth variation could influence the p reduction processes and regulate p dynamics effectively in lakes the change of environmental factors including water depth and temperature can accordingly regulate the balance between the mineralization degree and phod gene which potentially controls the eutrophic level of aquatic environments in the recent studies the literatures about reactive p regeneration and replenishment in the water sediment systems generally focused on p cycling which were controlled by inorganic parameters however the research about the influence of abundance of phod encoding microorganisms and processes of enzymatic reactions about p cycle driven by transseasonal temperature variation in lake systems are still limited and should be paid more attention the regulation effect of microorganisms on po decomposition for fueling reactive p in the lake systems at varied season is still rare given the importance of po the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the variation of different p fractions and apa in sediments via shift of seasons of a representative eutrophic lake 2 quantity the abundance and microbial diversity of phod encoding gene in the sediment under changed hydrological condition using high throughput sequencing and 3 clarify the influence degree of phod encoding bacteria communities on p regeneration and lease of the lake sediments controlled by seasonal water temperature and depth changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and processing two groups of sediment core matrix covered with overlying water were taken using a columnar sampler from three research area of shijiuhu lake sites c1 3 fig 1 a freshwater shallow lake situated in eastern china in different seasons with varied water temperatures and depths january in winter 2021 june in spring and september in summer 2022 respectively sites c1 c2 and c3 were located in the north east and south areas of the lake respectively numerous culture ponds were distributed in the south of the lake this lake has been experiencing the potential eutrophication and accumulation of nutrients including p via river and runoff discharges due to the increasing human activities around the lake especially in the northern area yuan et al 2021 noted that the water depth of this lake was influenced by rainfall and runoff inlet and dramatically fluctuated in different seasons between about 0 and 6 m yuan et al 2021 at each sampling time three sediment cores were sliced in layers at 1 cm interval and a total of 10 sub samples were obtained for each sediment column about 1 g fresh wet sediment samples were used for apa measurement the surplus sediment sub samples were lyophilized with vacuum freeze drier at low temperature 50 c and ground following being sieved through a 100 mesh sieve the obtained sediment pellets were preserved in 80 c for subsequent analysis another set of sediment cores without disturbance were immediately transported into the lab and used for high resolution hr peeper deployment to obtain po4 3 concentrations in the interstitial water of sediment columns xu et al 2012

water were obtained in field and in the lab supporting information text s1 respectively 2 2 deploying of hr peeper the hr peeper device matrix were inserted vertically into undisturbed sediment columns covering with overlying water obtained in different seasons the hr peeper device is composed of an acrylic shell with a series of vertical array of dialysis chambers dissolved chemicals including po4 3 can diffuse into chambers through the dialysis membrane and finally reach equilibrium with that in the pore water of sediment xu et al 2012 these devices were retrieved from the

by centrifuging at 5 000 g phosphate po4 3 concentration in the extractant was measured with molybdenum blue colorimetry 2 4 31p nmr analysis po compounds in lyophilized sediments after mixing the same layer of samples upper 1 3 cm middle 4 6 cm and bottom 7 10 cm layers abbreviated to u m and b layers were extracted with mixture of 0 25 m naoh and 0 05 m edta for 16 h with solid solution ratio

oscillated using ultrasonator for 1 min to liberate the phosphatase in the microorganism cells the mixture then reacted with 1 ml 50 mg ml p nitrophenyl phosphate pnpp sigma chemicals usa at 25 c for 1 h for the production of p nitrophenol pnp the reaction was terminated using 1 ml of 1 m naoh after centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was obtained and absorbance was measured using colorimetric method for the obtaining of apa value in the sediment samples the apase dynamic parameters including maximum enzyme velocity vmax and michaelis constant km were synchronously measured according to zhou et al 2002 in brief 1 g fresh sediments were homogenized with tris hcl buffer with ph of 8 4 pnpp solution with concentrations at 0 05 to 3 mm were injected into the homogenates respectively following incubating for 1 h at 25 c similarly the apa value for each sample was measured using colorimetric method finally the values of vmax and km were obtained using a

the lake obtained in different sampling sites and seasons were plotted in fig s1 water temperatures remarkably increased from less than 10 c in winter to about 27 c in spring and more than 30 c in summer in all sites respectively the water depths of overlying water in winter 2021 were less than 0 5 cm and remarkably raised to about 3 0 cm in spring 2022 the water depth dramatically decreased to less than 0 5 m again due to the extreme high temperature and deficiency runoff input for long time in the summer of 2022 in the watershed lower do concentrations were detected in spring than that in winter and summer increasing concentrations of tp and po4 3 in the overlying water were simultaneously detected from winter to summer higher chla concentrations with the maximum value reaching up to 41 4 μg l were measured in spring than that in winter and summer similarly incremental toc concentrations in the overlying water were also found from winter to summer 3 2 change of p fractions in sediments the p fractions on the solid sediment profiles in varied seasons with different water temperatures and depths were portrayed in fig 2 the concentrations of tp in the sediments ranged from 320 4 to 937 8 mg kg the values didn t show remarkably consistent variation on the whole columns collected in winter and summer except the deep layer of core c2 in winter having distinct increase slight decrease was found on sediment profiles in spring for the tp concentrations the similar change trends were detected for pi concentrations in the sediment cores from different sites and seasons which varied between 172 0 and 896 9 mg kg lower po concentrations were measured from 108 3 to 230 1 mg kg with the highest values found in spring the sediments collected in winter with the lowest temperature and water depth had the lowest po concentrations and relative stable values on the whole sediment profiles slight downward decline of po was detected in sediment column in summer noted that po concentrations remarkably decreased downwards to less than half on the all sediment profiles in spring with the highest water depths fig 2 also displayed the varied distribution of ionic po4 3 concentrations in interstitial water of sediments with 10 cm depth under the water sediment interface obtained using hr peeper technique for different sampling sites and seasons the highest values of 0 43 mg l were detected in spring with the high water levels compared to other two seasons the values downwards increased from the sediment surface to deeper layer at approximate 5 cm depth following distinctly decline to the bottom layer with low value of approximate 0 07 mg l the po4 3 concentrations kept the relatively stable and low values at 0 01 0 08 mg l on the whole profiles in winter and summer with radically different water temperatures and similarly low water depths the solution 31p nmr spectra for specific sediment layers obtained from varied seasons are displayed and classified in fig s2 po components and concentrations were also listed in table s1 total po concentrations in the extracts varied from 13 60 to 20 43 mg kg in all sediment layers at different sampling times the identification of specific po compounds refers to cade menun 2005 and backnäs et al 2012 the spectra area varying from 5 7 to 7 ppm were separated and quantified remarkable peaks at 6 2 5 ppm were classified to monoesters with ratio accounting for 0 04 0 30 of total po diesters with chemical shift values at approximate 11 ppm were surveyed and assigned as dna po with ratio occupying 0 02 0 18 of total po which are normally lower than monoesters chemical shift at about 4 5 ppm was only found at the upper layer of the sediment core obtained in winter and attributed to pyrophosphate generally higher po components including monoesters and diesters were detected in sediments obtained in spring relative to that in winter and summer 3 3 variation of apa and enzyme kinetic parameters the apa concentrations and enzyme kinetic parameters including vmax and km were plotted in fig 3 relatively low apa values were found in solid sediments in spring varying from 25 9 to 47 0 μg g h the values didn t show the remarkable change on the whole profiles in all research sites as well as the sedimentary depths remarkable increase of apa on the whole columns in all sites ranging from 40 3 to 91 6 μg g h were detected in spring with higher water temperatures and levels the highest apa values were found at approximate 5 cm depth following the decrease until the bottom of the sediment cores the apa values generally higher than that in winter but lower than that in spring were also surveyed in summer with values varying between 32 2 and 63 9 μg g h when having the highest water temperatures higher vmax values of apa were found in winter and spring with the lowest and the highest water depth respectively which reaching up to approximately 287 0 μg g h in spring decline of vmax less than 121 7 μg g h were found in the sediment in summer with the highest water temperature and the low water depth generally higher vmax were found at deeper sediment layers in all sampling sites in addition the highest km values were found in winter having the lowest water temperature with the highest value than 60 μg l in site c3 noteworthy decline of km values were detected in site c3 however the lowest km values less than 10 7 μg l were found in the sediment obtained in summer finally the similar change trends of vmax km values were found in sites c1 and c2 in all sampling seasons remarkably downwards decline were detected in winter and spring conversely the vmax km values generally increased from the top sediment layers toward the bottom layers in the summer 3 4 absolute abundance of functional genes in sediment cores fig 3 also displayed the variation of absolute abundance of p harboring functional gene phod in solid sediment columns in different research areas during the varied seasons distinct abundances of phod gene were detected at the different depths and sites of sediment cores and varied from 1 68 to 2 85 106 copies g dw at the whole sediment profiles in winter remarkable increase of phod gene absolute abundances were observed at 1 45 3 77 106 copies g dw in the spring sediment noted that downwards decline of absolute abundances of phod gene were found toward the bottom layers in winter in three sediment cores obtained in spring finally in summer with the highest water temperature the absolute abundance of phod gene downwards decreased with mean values from 0 08 to 1 07 106 copies g dw from the top to the bottom layers at the three sampling sites remarkable decrease were found at sites c2 and c3 3 5 diversity and changes of phod gene community the phod encoding functional gene communities for p cycle in specific sediment depths u m and b layers from different seasons were analyzed by using functional gene sequencing fig 4 based on out clustering and classification in winter total 515 931 580 702 high quality sequences for phod gene were obtained from the sample matrix and clustered into 1878 2082 otus based on 97 species similarity total 156 947 357 906 and 707 038 1100 564 high quality sequences were gotten for phod harboring gene in spring and summer 151 372 343 648 and 523 644 700 917 otus were also obtained in spring and summer based on species similarity of 97 respectively the clustering analysis of diversity of species composition based on outs showed that the predominant bacterial communities in the sediment cores at genus level had varied relative abundance 4 of total otus at different seasons fig 4a gene communities were slightly different along the depth gradient of the sediments and the change of seasons bacteria cobetia had the highest abundance 25 22 0 77 as genus phod at the whole sediment profile in all sampling seasons followed by calothrix 18 91 1 40 aquabacterium 5 39 0 95 and mitsuaria 4 63 0 51 bacteria cobetia dominated the highest abundance 25 43 4 40 as phod harboring gene at the sediment columns followed by calothrix 18 77 0 31 aquabacterium 5 84 0 65 and mitsuaria 4 15 0 53 for dominant gene cobetia the upper layer of sediment had the lower abundance than deeper sediment layer generally noteworthy shift of predominant bacterial communities was found in the sediment cores in varied seasons with different water depth and temperature the relatively rare gene with relative abundance less than 4 of total otus didn t display the remarkable difference in the sediment cores fig 4b at varied water depths and temperatures venn analysis indicated that a total of 1229 otus existed in both sediments for phod genes for all seasons fig 5 a total of 1634 otus existed in both sediment layers u m and b for phod encoding gene generally higher out sizes were found at upper layer in all sampling seasons and lower out sizes were obtained for sediments in spring having deeper water depth relative to other sampling times the ecological network based on the otu matrix was constructed to explore the potential intraspecific mechanism and co occurrence characteristics of bacterial community based on strong significant correlations p 0 05 at genus level fig 5b cladogram fig s3 clearly displayed the difference of dominant taxa in the sediments from varied seasons the network for phod gene had 67 nodes and 377 edges with density 0 085 and average clustering coefficient 0 243 based on the modularity class the network of phod gene in the sediments could be clarified to 5 modules with modularity resolution of 0 382 the lefse algorithm detected 10 8 and 10 differentially dominant taxonomic clades as active biomarkers in winter spring and summer sediments respectively fig 5c noted that majority of these representative differentially abundant bacterial taxa presented with high lda scores lda 2 such as burkholdriales and betaproteobacteria generally possessed lower relative abundance than dominant genera mentioned above including cobetia and calothrix with relative abundance higher than 4 the diversity indices based on outs numbers including chao1 ace and shannon reduced from winter to spring following increase to summer fig 6 a generally the lowest diversity indices were observed in spring simpson indice displayed contrary tendency with winter having the highest values the significant differentiation among sample groups was also identified using pca pcoa nmds and pls da fig 6b analysis based on otu compositions for different sediment depth the highest diversity indices including chao1 ace and shannon were detected in upper layer compared to deeper sediments fig 6b the lowest diversity indices were detected in summer having the highest water temperature fig 6a the β diversity indices including pca pcoa nmds and pls da analysis for phod gene based on otus in sediment from different seasons displayed the obvious clusters and dispersion among the sampling times 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of p fractions in the sediment similar variation trends were found for tp and pi concentrations in sediment columns in different sampling time significantly positive correlation r 0 74 p 0 01 were detected between tp and pi concentration fig 7 a suggesting pi was the important tp compositions in the sediments higher po concentrations at upper 10 cm depth in spring and summer indicated the po accumulation at the water sediment interface in addition the decrease downwards from the interface to the bottom layer suggested the mineralization of po under aerobic anaerobic scenarios in higher water temperature similar downwards decrease along the depth gradient was also detected in erken lake ahlgren et al 2005 significantly positive correlation coefficient r 0 86 p 0 01 were also detected between tp and po concentration suggesting po could simultaneously influence the occurrence of tp in the sediments even possessing relatively lower concentrations than pi positive correlation coefficient r 0 65 p 0 05 between po and srp in the interstitial water suggested that po in the solid sediments was the important potential source of srp which is labile and can be digested by microorganisms higher concentrations of individual po compounds including monoesters and diesters were found in the sediments of spring indicating the import and accumulation of these biogenic po species in the sediments at the scenario with high water depth and temperatures higher po concentrations in the suspended particulate matter were also surveyed in lake chaohu china in spring indicating the contribution of runoff input yang et al 2020 reduced runoff input via river due to the extreme high temperature in the summer 2022 was speculated to be responsible for the decrease of monoesters and diesters concentrations in the sediments the largest identified biogenic p compound group in all sites and times was monoesters which were also measured in other lakes worldwide ahlgren et al 2006 bai et al 2009 shinohara et al 2012 liu et al 2016 sedimentary monoesters and diesters may be produced by algae macrophytes and microbes and they might also be introduced from the input of terrestrial sources liu et al 2009 dramatic decline of dna po was detected in the sediments in the summer when the water depth decreased this suggested the degradation of this po fraction in high temperature and do without the overlaying of exogenous input of po through the riverine discharge higher monoesters and diesters concentrations were also detected in a eutrophic brackish water lake in chile in summer sediments than that in winter sediments campos et al 2022 diesters were more labile than monoesters and were speculated to preferentially utilized by microbes resulting to the decrease of diester concentrations in sediments pant and reddy 2001 makarov et al 2005 darch et al 2014 additionally higher diesters monoesters ratios 0 74 0 17 in spring indicated that monoesters underwent more substantial transformation during the sedimentation in the episode with higher water depth than in both winter and summer with ratios of 0 51 0 05 and 0 56 0 20 respectively shinohara et al 2012 4 2 linkages between apa and phod gene abundance most microorganisms related in po degradation are heterotrophs and utilize organic c to generate extracellular enzymes and promote the p availability bi et al 2020 chen et al 2022 higher cyanophyta biomass manifested as chla in overlying water and po4 3 concentrations in interstitial water were detected in spring having higher apa values suggesting the increase of apa enhanced the release of srp from sediments and fueled the primary productivity in the lake water wang et al 2012 the p contained in the microorganisms such as cyanophyta existing as po can serve as metabolic substrate for p mineralization to regulate apa hu et al 2018 apa was considered an inducible enzyme which could be regulated by the ambient pi level hoppe 2003 that is apa was improved under the po4 3 deficient condition and suppressed when po4 3 concentrations were high chróst and overbeck 1987 however pandey and yadav 2017 found that apa in the sediments didn t fluctuate with the changes of pi availability indicating the complicated correlations among apa and pi in the natural environments remarkably positive correlation were simultaneously detected between apa and po and srp concentrations r 0 97 and 0 79 p 0 01 and 0 05 respectively fig 7a and fig s4a b this manifested that apa could promote the hydrolysis of po and raise the pi concentrations in the water when po concentration was higher in the hotter seasons significantly positive correlations between monoesters diesters and srp were also found in the sediments fig 7a verified that srp was supplemented via the mineralization of monoesters and diesters in the sediments through the apa hydrolysis biogenic monoesters and diesters can be hydrolyzed into more labile pi forms by microbial enzymatic activity such as bacterial phosphomonoesterases pases under the alkaline circumstance torres et al 2014 ma et al 2019 vmax represented the catalytic velocity of the apase that is the stronger catalytic ability of enzyme displayed the higher vmax the km represents the affinity of an enzyme complex and a substrate lower km values mean higher affinity xie et al 2010 high vmax were found in spring showed the higher catalytic ability in the sediments under the conditions of higher water temperature and depth vmax were also found in spring in taihu lake with po4 3 concentrations of 0 011 0 020 mg gao et al 2006 higher apa values observed in seasons with higher temperatures suggested that the apa increased with temperature which was consistent with some previous studies persson et al 2011 differently donghu lake in china had elevated vmax values in winter with higher po4 3 concentrations reaching up to 0 3 mg l zhou et al 2002 this was consistent with the relatively higher apa and vmax than summer observed in spring sediments in this research suggesting that water depth exerted stronger influence on catalytic ability of apa in the sediments than temperature lower km values in summer than that in winter and spring could be attributed to the stronger affinity on the condition of low po4 3 concentrations however this didn t bring about the stronger enzyme hydrolysis of po in the high temperatures the vmax km values were considered to be able to characterize the catalytic efficiency of apase in the sediment systems huang and shindo 2000 xie et al 2010 raised vmax km values downwards were measured in the sediment profiles with the increase of water temperatures and po4 3 concentrations in the interstitial water fig 3 remarkable difference were found in the obtained sediment cores in varied sampling times which performed as downwards reducing vmax km values in sites c1 and c3 and raising values in site c2 with the highest solid po values and po4 3 concentrations in the interstitial water this result partly conflicted with the discovery of xie et al 2010 which concluded that vmax km deceased with the increase of po4 3 concentrations in sludge vmax km was proved to be debatable to act as a good indicator of catalytic efficiency of apa in the lake sediments even weakly positive correlation coefficient was found between vmax km and apa values as well as srp concentrations bacteria contain large amounts of diesters which may increase the dna p concentrations during sedimentation and alter the composition of p groups in the sediment reitze et al 2012 higher toc concentrations were observed in the overlying water in spring together with the significantly positive correlations between toc and p fractions tp pi and po fig s4c testifying the accumulation of p containing organism residues in spring relative to winter and summer with low water levels higher apa along with vmax values in spring indicated the strengthening mineralization of diesters which induced the accumulation of monoesters in the sediments on the condition of higher water temperature and depth this was further evidenced by the decrease of dna po concentrations in summer meaning the rapid mineralization and depletion of dna po as well the accumulation of po4 3 in the interstitial water similar degradation of dna po and accumulation of monoesters were also found in sediment in lake nordborg dnmark with seasons from spring to summer reitzel et al 2012 significantly positive correlations were found among apa and monoesters as well as diesters fig 7a further affirming the strong enzymatic hydrolysis degree of diesters to monoesters in higher temperatures 4 3 phod gene regulates the apa in the sediments the phod functional gene was the most common apa gene and has been widely employed to act as a genetic marker to explore po mineralization capacity in natural environments wan et al 2020 apa was closely related to the community composition and abundance of phod encoding bacteria wang et al 2022 in this study absolute abundances of phod gene markedly downwards increased with the promotion of apa values until approximate 5 cm sediment depths when temperature raised fig 3 however significantly positive correlation was not detected between absolute abundance of phod functional gene and apa fig 7a in the sediments remarkably increasing po4 3 concentrations in the interstitial water and phod gene as well as apa values were simultaneously measured at approximate 5 cm depths in all sites this meant the acceleration of apase generation from microorganisms and mineralization of po in the solid sediments especially under the episodes of higher water temperatures and depths this synergistic effect was not reinforced in summer with relatively low phod absolute abundances and apa along with low po4 3 concentrations which potentially suggesting that high water depth rather than water temperature facilitated the apa intensify induced by phod encoding gene this was also testified by the higher apa values obtained in the sediments in spring and summer having raised temperatures noted that upwards decreasing apa values were found in the sediment columns along with the reducing po4 3 concentrations even though the absolute abundances of phod gene continuously increased until the water sediment interface layer especially in spring and summer different variations of apa in the sediments were found in lake donghu zhou et al 2001 lake taihu and lake kinneret hadas and pinkas 1997 zhang et al 2007 which generally downwards increased and decreased with the change of sediment depths respectively we speculated that some specific bacteria which encoded phod gene existing in the deeper sediment layers promoted the generation of apase on the aerobic condition especially in spring higher bacterial biomass in the sediment was detected in higher temperature qian et al 2011 positive correlation between apa producing bacteria and apa was found in the sediment of lake of constance jansson et al 1988 indicating the potential enrichment of phod encoding bacteria in deeper sediment layers when apa values were high in donghu lake and this work zhou et al 2001 however identifying the predominant phod harboring gene was important for the clarifying the mineralization path of po in the sediments and supplementary mechanism of labile srp for overlying water 4 4 dominant phod gene actuates the p activity in the sediments noteworthy changes in the composition and interaction of bacteria community may affect the functions of bacteria communities in the environments cobetia was the most abundant phod encoding genera with relative abundances higher than 15 before and after experiencing the temperature shift calothrix following by aquabacterium and mitsuaria in the sediment profiles from the selected sampling sites also had relatively high abundances higher relative abundances of cobetia were detected at deeper sediment layers which showed the higher absolute abundances of phod gene fig 3 indicating that cobetia was the dominant contributor of phod encoding community involved in po cycle in the sediments noted that the cobetia didn t display remarkably higher abundances in spring when higher water temperatures and depths occurred it was speculated that some rare phod harboring bacterial communities worked together and balanced the phod gene amounts in the sediments in varied episodes with different water depths and temperatures the zi within module connectivity and pi among module connectivity plot fig 7b showed that most nodes were peripherals 52 2 following connectors 47 8 and no node was in module hubs and network hubs the group of otus nodes in connectors quadrant were highly connected within a module or multiple modules which were defined as keystone species in the research regions guimera and amaral 2005 deng et al 2012 cobetia and calothrix were in connectors and considered as key genera however relatively more nodes fallen into connectors in the network than other aquatic environments indicated that rare phod encoding genera except cobetia and calothrix also played important role between modules and contributed to the apa generation chen et al 2022 these rare phod encoding genera were speculated to be responsible for the high phod harboring gene abundance in the spring the ecological network showed that there were only 24 9 and 9 0 lines for phod gene showed positive and negative correlation between the connected nodes respectively indicating the modules were separated pang and ji 2019 the genera cylindrospermum skermanella methylobacterium xanthomonas and labilithrix had the maximum connected degree of 25 22 22 21 and 21 respectively cobetia and calothrix had only 3 and 2 connected degrees it s worth noting that the aforementioned bacteria of phod gene with the high node degree in network were the keystone species with larger relative abundances than any others the most connected species for phod gene was sulfuritalea linked to different modules with high average degree low betweenness centrality and high closeness centrality and relative abundances and were identified as key genera we further speculated that the occurrence of some rare genes with low abundance is detrimental for p cycle in the sediments in varied seasons generally higher edges and nodes indicated that phod gene than other genera species dominated the bacterial community in the lake sediments lefse can be used to distinguish the predominant species in various bacterial communities and to elucidate the biologically differential bacteria among various microbiota zhang et al 2018 the lefse indicated that some rare populations played key roles in determining the bacterial community structure which encoding phod gene in the sediments additionally these biomarkers were differentiated among the seasons indicating the shift of species of the microbiota with the regulation of water temperatures and levels in varied seasons generally higher lda scores along with higher relative abundance of dominant genera including xanthomonas suggested that these microbial communities predominantly contributed to the stronger abundance and activities of pod encoding bacteria communities in spring this speculation was further testified by metastats heatmap analysis which showed that genus acidovorax had the highest relative abundance of 4 96 and lda of 4 2 in spring sediments fig 5d p 0 05 the analysis of β diversity indices suggested the occurrence of bacteria communities with varied abundance in different seasons further regulating the absolute abundance and enzyme hydrolysis function of phod gene in different episodes in addition lower α diversity indices including chao1 ace and shannon and higher simpson indice detected in spring compared to winter and summer indicated the low community richness which encoded functional phod gene in the sediments fig 6a however higher absolute abundances existing in season spring fig 4a confirmed that some specific genera in total bacterial community including dominant species and biomarkers with relatively low abundance contributed to the remarkably abundant phod gene in the sediments in the scenario of deeper water depth 4 5 environmental influencers of phod encoding bacterial community the pearson s correlation analysis between bacterium species generating phod functional gene and environment factors was illustrated in fig s5 similar to some previous studies proteobacteria and cyanobacteria were the predominant phod encoding bacteria in the lake sediment at phylum level lagos et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2022 table s2 however cobetia and calothrix as the dominant phod harboring functional gene which affiliated to these phyla generally didn t display the significant correlation with the environment factors including various po fractions and apase dynamic parameters genera aquabacterium and mitsuaria which affiliated to proteobacteria had the significantly positive correlation with spr in the overlying water and vmax in the sediments additionally significantly positive correlation were also detected between herbaspirillum with extreme low abundance in the sediments and po as well as apa values similarly rare genera acidovorax and xanthomonas with relative abundance less than 4 5 also showed the significantly positive correlation with spr and vmax positive correlations were also found between some specific taxa such as comamonas and po fractions including monoesters these findings suggested that environment factors didn t induce the linear regulation of predominant bacteria communities in the sediments however the important environment factors including po fractions and apase dynamic parameters can drive the fluctuation of some genera having low relative abundance and then trigger the mineralization of po compounds and srp release from the solid sediment toward the water redundancy analysis rda was plotted in fig 7c to evaluate the influence of environment variables on phod harboring bacterial communities on varied conditions zhao et al 2020 different p factions extracted with edta naoh and po compounds were omitted after redundancy removal the result showed that vmax was the most critical environmental driver p 0 05 with rda1 value of 1 48 among the total variation in the phod encoding bacterial genera the apa remarkably positively correlated with po and spr in sediment and interstitial water fig 7a positive correlation was also observed between srp and vmax values that is apa could drive the release and accumulation of srp through po mineralization in the sediment systems in the lake campos et al 2022 in addition positive correlations were observed between environment factors including po and apa and bacterial genera such as cobetia methylomonas scytonema cupriavidus and acidovorax further suggesting abundant and rare phod harboring genera simultaneously determined phod gene abundance in the sediments this was speculated to be responsible for the weak correlation between α diversity indices and environment factors fig 7d finally stronger coupling relationship between environment factors and bacteria species encoding phod gene were found in spring indicating higher water depth facilitated and accelerated the mineralization of po in the lake sediment and potentially fueled the eutrophication of lake conclusions in the present study we investigated the po mineralization processess influenced by phod encoding microorganisms in the lake sediments after experiencing the transition of water temperatures and depths the transseasonal p fractions and phod encoding gene bacterial communities in lake water sediment ecosystem were explored using varied sequential extracting procedures and high throughput sequencing technique po concentrations remarkably increased in spring and summer due to the terrigenous input and biomass deposition the degradation and mineralization of monoesters and diesters with higher concentrations and ratios accounting for total po in the sediments in spring having higher water depth was the non negligible source of labile po4 3 in the interstitial water in the sediments additionally stronger apa in spring was responsible for the mineralization of po in spring remarkably increasing of absolute abundance of phod encoding gene in spring from the bottom to top sediment layers facilitated the generation of apase from microorganisms noted that apa decreased from approximate 5 cm depth from the interface suggesting the specific phod harboring gene bacterial community restrained the apa even the phod gene absolute abundance continuously increased upwards cobetia and calothrix followed by aquabacterium and mitsuaria were the most abundant phod encoding genera having relative abundance higher than 4 in the sediment experiencing the temperature shift weakly positive correlation between dominant bacterial genera and apa and p fractions suggesting that rare genera was also involved in the apa generation and po hydrolysis in the sediment generally higher water depth rather than temperature in spring promotes the adjustment of apa and mineralization of po in the sediment and further increases of labile po4 3 load in the lake water declaration of

14733,a consequential life cycle assessment lca was utilized to compare the environmental impacts of food waste and sewage sludge management strategies the strategies included a novel two phase anaerobic digestion ad system and alternatives including landfill waste to energy composting anaerobic membrane bioreactor and conventional ad wet continuous stirred tank reactor cstr the co management of food waste with sewage sludge was also considered for the two phase ad system and for a conventional ad reactor a multidimensional lca approach was taken considering the five midpoint impact categories of global warming smog human health particulate acidification and eutrophication estimated using the u s epa tool for the reduction and assessment of chemical and other environmental impacts co management of food waste and sewage sludge using the novel two phase ad system was shown to maximize energy recovery and had a net global warming benefit while reducing other environmental impacts compared with the alternative management strategies it had similar relative environmental advantages across all categories as conventional ad with the advantage of a smaller physical footprint however both approaches featured net environmental burdens when the background electric grid intensity fell below 0 25 kg co2 eq kwh 1 as could be expected in a decarbonized electric future upgrading the biogas produced from ad to renewable natural gas can displace the use of fossil natural gas for other non electricity energy requirements that are difficult to decarbonize and may extend the time period of significant environmental benefits of utilizing ad for organic waste management treatment of the nutrient rich supernatant generated by the novel two phase ad system could be an obstacle for utilities with stringent nutrient discharge limits future research and full scale implementation are needed to demonstrate the benefits of the two phase ad system predicted through this analysis graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lca anaerobic codigestion food waste data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction of the 63 million tons of food waste

largest source of the country s anthropogenic methane emissions accounting for 17 of all anthropogenic emissions usepa 2021a various technologies have been deployed in the u s to recover energy and

resulting in a net global warming benefit and the lowest ghg impact among these food waste management strategies hodge et al 2016 lee et al 2020 slorach et al 2020 thyberg and tonjes 2017 despite ad s superior environmental performance in comparison to alternative food waste management strategies only 8 3 of food waste in the u s was managed with ad in 2018 orcr 2018 reasons for the low uptake of wet ad technology for food waste management include concerns about ad stability due to the low buffering capacity of food waste which limits the organic loading rate of the system or requires ph control typically between 6 5 and 7 2 braguglia et al 2018 grady et al 2011a this requires wet ad systems to operate at long retention times 20 40 days to maintain stability which in turn necessitates the use of large digester tanks and heating equipment resulting in high capital costs for ad fonoll et al 2016 kong et al 2016 pramanik et al 2019 xu et al 2018 while dry ad systems usually operate at higher organic loading rates than wet systems the biogas produced per ton of waste treated is lower than in wet ad systems due to the more limited distribution and contact between the substrate and the microbial populations angelonidi and smith 2015 eref 2015 due to these operational challenges dry ad systems have not been as widely implemented as wet systems in the u s eref 2015 co digestion of food waste with primary and secondary sewage sludge from water resource recovery facilities wrrfs has significant potential to improve the energy and nutrient recovery from both waste streams the carbon to nitrogen c n mass ratio of sewage sludge is usually much lower 5 15 than the c n mass ratio considered optimal for ad 20 30 to avoid ammonia inhibition cook et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 the addition of food waste to sewage sludge within anaerobic digesters at wrrfs can increase methane production and yield and improve digester stability by increasing the c n mass ratio moreover the high buffering capacity of sewage sludge is beneficial for co digestion with food waste and limits the ph fluctuations common in food waste mono digestion bolzonella et al 2006 macintosh et al 2019 mata alvarez et al 2014 shen et al 2015 several food waste management studies have assessed the environmental benefits of co digesting food waste and sewage sludge becker et al 2017 edwards et al 2018 iqbal et al 2022 lee et al 2020 these studies have shown that co digestion of food waste with sewage sludge had a lower global warming potential than separate organic waste management because the synergistic effects of co digestion improve methane generation and offset a greater amount of fossil energy novel high rate ad technologies such as anaerobic dynamic membrane bioreactors andmbrs have been developed to address issues associated with conventional ad systems wet continuous stirred tank reactor cstr fed with a total solids content in the substrate below 10 an andmbr harnesses the function of a dynamic membrane a cake layer developed on a mesh support to enhance biomass retention and decouple the solids retention time srt from the hydraulic retention time hrt abbassi guendouz et al 2012 hu et al 2018 this allows andmbrs to operate at a low hrt reducing tank volumes and associated costs in comparison to conventional ad while achieving long srts necessary to support the growth of anaerobic microorganisms and promote complete substrate degradation ersahin et al 2017 a bench scale two phase ad system consisting of two andmbrs was recently developed to advance the use of ad for resource recovery from food waste and other organic waste streams fonoll et al 2023 zhu et al 2022 fig s1 in the supporting information si the first phase andmbr rumen bioreactor was

enhances vfa degradation and methanogenesis by recirculating the permeate through a novel tree shaped dynamic membrane structure that did not require active antifouling measures during a yearlong

et al 2023 while pilot and industrial level demonstrations are needed to validate results and test full scale operability a holistic understanding of the environmental consequences of using this two phase andmbr system for food waste and sewage sludge management in comparison to conventional ad and other waste management strategies must also be determined the goal of this study was to use environmental life cycle assessment to evaluate alternative food waste management systems and understand if improvements can be achieved by adopting different management strategies and implementing new technology including the use of a novel two phase andmbr system the scope of this evaluation included a comparison of conventional single stream management strategies that do not separate food waste from municipal waste e g landfill and wte and management strategies that consist of separate collection and processing of food waste e g composting conventional ad and the two phase andmbr management of sewage sludge was included in a system expansion to assess the performance of co managing food waste with sludge using conventional ad and the two phase andmbr sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify the key performance parameters contributing to the environmental burdens and benefits of each system comparison of dry ad systems to wet ad systems is left to future work 2

municipal wastewater reclamation is uncommon in the u s usepa 2012 accordingly side streams including permeate produced from the two phase andmbr and supernatant generated during sludge dewatering

management systems landfill ad and wte ad food waste did not require separation from the municipal solid waste stream landfill activities included in the system boundary were the energy inputs needed to operate the landfill the capture and utilization of lfg for power and heat generation the treatment of landfill leachate and the emissions from escaped lfg the landfill methane yield of food waste was assumed to be 0 4 m3 ch4 kg 1 dry food waste and methane landfill emissions were considered over a 100 year time horizon to encompass all of the potential emissions from decaying waste levis and barlaz 2014 it was assumed that 1 kg of food waste would produce 2 10 4 m3 of landfill leachate kurniawan and lo 2009 which is captured as wastewater and sent to a wrrf for the wte system the material inputs required for air pollution controls and estimates of stack emissions were adapted from the model derived by harrison et al 2000 the energy released from waste incineration was recovered to generate electricity exported to the grid and thermal energy for use offsite bottom ash from incineration was estimated to be 0 018 kg ash kg 1 food waste hegde and trabold 2019 disposal of bottom ash was modeled as being transported to an ash landfill where it was assumed to be inert source separated system models compost ad andmbr ad and ad ad assumed food waste had been pre sorted to remove contaminants the compost model was adapted from the default compost process model derived by levis and barlaz 2013 which considered the use of windrow turners during active composting and curing windrow composting is the most common method of composting in the u s composting council 2023 compost humus was produced by mixing water and sawdust with food waste and energy inputs were needed to operate the composting facility output flows from the compost facility included air emissions from curing off gasses ch4 n2o nh3 and vocs the finished humus was transported for land application to offset the use of mineral fertilizers the two phase andmbr food waste model required food waste to be mixed with water to create a slurry with a 3 0 total solids concentration the first phase andmbr had an hrt of 0 5 days to achieve an organic loading rate of 40 kg vs m 3 d 1 permeate from the first phase andmbr was fed to the second phase r andmbr the r andmbr had an hrt of 5 days to achieve an organic loading rate of 4 kg vs m 3 d 1 to account for the operational uncertainty of the loading rate for the novel two phase system the solids feed rate was varied between 1 to 5 as part of the uncertainty analysis naoh was added to the first phase andmbr at a rate of 0 04 kg dry naoh kg 1 food waste to maintain a ph above 6 2 which also helped maintain the ph in the second phase r andmbr around 7 2 the two phase system s methane yield was assumed to be 0 50 m3 ch4 kg 1 vsfed fonoll et al 2023 methane emissions included assumed emissions for fugitive biogas from the digesters and chp unit as well as dissolved methane from the r andmbr permeate and sludge supernatant according to the calculations described in section 4 of the si conventional mono digestion of food waste was modeled using a single phase mesophilic continuous stirred tank reactor cstr food waste was mixed with water to create a slurry with a 7 5 total solids concentration to achieve an organic loading rate of 1 9 kg vs m 3 d 1 the ad model included the use of naoh at a rate of 0 04 kg dry naoh kg 1 food waste to counteract ph fluctuations due to the accumulation of vfas the methane yield was approximated as 0 40 m3 ch4 kg 1 vsfed hegde and trabold 2019 nagao et al 2012 zhang et al 2007 conventional mono digestion of sewage sludge was modeled as a single stage mesophilic cstr fed with a 4 0 total solids concentration and methane yield of 0 25 m3 ch4 kg 1 vsfed tchobanoglous et al 1991 to account for the operational benefits of co digestion the two phase and conventional ad systems were also modeled considering the co management of food waste with sewage sludge co andmbr and co ad as further detailed in section 4 of the si co digestion was assumed to eliminate the need for water and naoh as sewage sludge acts as a sufficient dilutant and ph buffer both co andmbr and co ad were also assumed to be fed a substrate with a higher percentage of solids than their corresponding mono digestion systems the baseline systems were modeled as being fed an influent with a 7 total solids concentration 55 food waste 45 sewage sludge by dry mass assuming 100 of food waste was diverted from landfill to co digestion conventional co digestion of food waste with sewage sludge has been shown to achieve a methane yield of about 0 40 m3 ch4 kg 1 vsfed bolzonella et al 2006 holliger et al 2017 similar to that achieved for conventional mono digestion of food waste therefore the co digestion methane yields were assumed to be 0 40 m3 ch4 kg 1 vsfed and 0 50 m3 ch4 kg 1 vsfed for co ad and co andmbr respectively for co andmbr sludge from the first phase andmbr produced from digesting food waste and sewage sludge would not meet current epa class b biosolids requirements because of the reactor s low srt walker et al 1994 so biosolids were modeled as being sent only to landfill 67 and incineration 33 2 4 uncertainty and sensitivity analysis a monte carlo analysis 10 000 simulations was performed to account for the uncertainties within each system model table 2 the majority of uncertainty parameters were associated with the ad process models a triangular distribution was assumed for uncertainty parameters with a most likely midpoint value while a uniform distribution was used in the absence of a midpoint estimate a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate each system s global warming performance depending on the i percentage of food waste diverted from municipal waste and ii electric grid generation source source separated food waste management systems were evaluated assuming a food waste diversion percentage of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 with remaining food waste being sent to landfill landfill and wte were not evaluated for varying degrees of food waste diversion as neither system would require food waste to be separated from the municipal waste stream the ghg intensity of grid electricity consumed by a system process or credited as an offset for excess electricity generation was varied based on generation source electricity generation sources evaluated included coal natural gas the 2018 u s national grid mix used for the baseline models and solar photovoltaic the fuel cycle ghg emissions for electricity corresponding to each source were 1 05 0 50 0 48 and 0 kg co2 eq kwh 1 respectively wang et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 life cycle environmental impacts of waste management system models fig 1 shows the environmental impacts of each waste management system for comparison the impacts are normalized to the net impacts of landfill ad currently the most common food waste management system the contribution of individual unit processes within each waste management system is shown in fig 2 impacts for source separated and co managed systems assumed 100 of food waste was diverted from landfill to the respective system table s18 all alternative management systems had a lower net gwp impact than landfill ad for other emissions wte ad and source separated systems had higher net impacts than landfill ad while the co managed systems generally had impacts lower than or comparable to landfill ad a comparison of this study s results to other studies that evaluated management methods for both food waste and sewage sludge is presented in table s21 3 1 1 co managed systems the co digestion systems that manage food waste and sewage sludge together co ad and co andmbr maximized resource recovery in the form of energy as methane and had the greatest decrease in gwp impacts in comparison to landfill ad co andmbr and co ad had the greatest net energy returns fig 3 which offset the use of fossil fuels for electricity and thermal energy generation and was the primary benefit for minimizing net environmental burdens for all emissions the sum of offset emissions from net electricity and thermal energy generation was about 1 5 times greater than the sum of gwp burdens for co andmbr and co ad a system is considered to have a net environmental benefit when the sum of offsets is greater than the sum of burdens co ad had net environmental benefits for gwp and acidification and co andmbr had net environmental benefits for gwp smog respiratory and acidification fugitive methane emissions had the greatest contribution to the gwp burden for both co digestion models escaped biogas accounted for 90 of fugitive methane whereas dissolved methane in wastewater accounted for 10 of emissions biogas capture efficiency which has been reported to range from between 93 to virtually 100 liebetrau et al 2017 was the largest source of gwp uncertainty fig s6 escaped biogas directly increased gwp burdens and indirectly decreased gwp benefits from the loss of potential energy generation from biogas combustion decreasing biogas capture efficiency from 96 to 93 increased net gwp impacts by over 75 in practice ensuring a high capture efficiency of biogas from ad systems is critical to maximizing resource recovery and mitigating gwp impacts additional parameters related to energy generation including the percent of usable heat output and digester methane yield were also strong contributors to gwp uncertainty eliminating the potential to export excess heat generated from chp reduced the gwp offset for co andmbr and co ad by 31 and 27 respectively removing the thermal energy offset increased net emissions across all system models particularly those that included chp or wte to manage food waste but did not significantly alter the normalized net impacts of each waste management system across all environmental impacts considered when accounting for model uncertainty co andmbr had an 81 or higher likelihood of achieving a smaller gwp than all single stream and source separated systems when compared to co ad co andmbr had a 50 likelihood of achieving a lower gwp but had a greater than 92 likelihood of achieving a lower smog respiratory and acidification impact fig 4 3 1 2 source separated systems both mono digestion systems andmbr ad and ad ad had higher environmental burdens than the co digestion systems because of the emissions related to the production of naoh used to control ph in the food waste digester the co digestion systems avoided this added burden because sewage sludge acted as a sufficient dilutant and ph buffer eliminating the need for naoh likewise the synergistic benefits of co digestion increased overall methane yield from the combined organic waste streams leading to greater methane production and a larger energy offset the increase in methane production resulted in a 28 and 18 increase in net electricity generation for co andmbr and co ad over andmbr ad and ad ad respectively co management of food waste with sewage sludge was superior to separate mono digestion of each waste because co digestion avoided the burdens associated with naoh and improved energy recovery by more efficiently converting substrate to methane compost ad had the second highest gwp impact among all waste management systems fertilizer offsets associated with land applying compost humus and biosolids only offset 6 of the system s total gwp burden and was even less for other impacts evaluated mirroring other studies that found minimal emission reductions from offsetting the use of mineral fertilizers hodge et al 2016 thyberg and tonjes 2017 because of the low contributions of fertilizer offsets the potential efficiency differences between mineral and organic fertilizer were not considered in this calculation as it would make a negligible impact on the result the results indicate that energy generation using wte or ad is preferable to nutrient recovery as compost for food waste management likewise land application of biosolids offset less than 5 of each system s total burdens across all environmental impacts land application of biosolids was still preferable to disposing to landfills or incineration because those processes produce added environmental burdens off gas emissions from the composter contributed the greatest burdens for gwp smog acidification eutrophication and respiratory emissions for compost ad similar to the findings of other studies that evaluated composting becker et al 2017 3 1 3 single stream systems wte ad had a net gwp benefit attributed to energy production offsets and had a lower gwp impact than the source separated systems and was comparable to the co managed systems however wte ad had high burdens compared to other systems for all other environmental impacts besides gwp air pollutants associated with direct air emissions from incineration and the production emissions for the materials needed for pollution controls i e lime and ammonia accounted for the majority of the system s burdens across all impacts landfill ad had the greatest net gwp impact among all systems fugitive methane emissions accounted for 92 of the gwp burdens and net energy production from biogas and lfg combustion displaced less than half of the system s gwp burdens lfg capture efficiency is highly dependent on the age of the landfill cell and cell cover type hodge et al 2016 levis and barlaz 2014 the lfg capture efficiency may range from only 35 for an active cell during initial waste burial to 90 for a cell with a geomembrane final cover spokas et al 2006 as food waste is readily degradable methane emissions are difficult to capture because food waste is degraded before an effective cover can be applied to the landfill cell an analysis by levis and barlaz 2014 concluded that the lifetime utilization of lfg from food waste for energy generation may vary between 22 2 65 4 depending on the waste decay rate and landfill regulatory requirements compared to the baseline landfill ad model with an average lfg utilization of 51 6 a poorly managed landfill with a lifetime lfg utilization rate of only 22 2 had twofold greater net gwp impact whereas a state of the art landfill with a lifetime lfg utilization rate of 65 4 had a gwp impact that was only half as large fig s6 the landfill ad model still had the highest net gwp impact among all waste management systems when considering a 65 4 lfg utilization rate landfill ad ranked among the lowest net impacts for all other environmental emissions minimal energy and material inputs were required to operate the landfill and pollutants from lfg and leachate other than methane discharged to air or water were relatively minor 3 1 4 impact of food waste diversion rates the sensitivity analysis accounted for food waste diversion rates for source separated management systems fig 5 diverting any amount of food waste from landfill yielded gwp reductions indicating landfill gas collection systems for capture of biogas from decaying organic wastes are not an ideal management strategy in comparison to alternatives however the alternate single stream system wte ad had a lower net gwp impact than compost ad andmbr ad and ad ad even when 100 of food waste was diverted similarly both co digestion systems did not achieve the same net gwp benefit as wte ad until over 90 of food waste was diverted considering the maximum food waste sorting efficiency is reported to be only 80 edwards et al 2018 it is unlikely that over 90 of food waste would be separated from the municipal waste stream consequently it may not be advantageous from a gwp perspective for municipalities already managing municipal waste with wte to separate food waste findings that mirror other studies that have evaluated wte hodge et al 2016 thyberg and tonjes 2017 however access to wte is limited over half of the 77 wte facilities that exist in the u s are concentrated in the northeast and only one new wte plant has been built since 1995 large capital costs for modern wte plants competition with cheaper electricity sources and low landfill tipping rates have largely prohibited the deployment of wte eere 2019 conversely over 2200 sites in the u s produce biogas via ad including over 1200 wrrfs eere 2019 co digestion has been shown to have the most economical life cycle cost for food waste management in comparison to wte compost and landfill lee et al 2020 ad also presents an opportunity to produce high value biofuels other than electricity and thermal energy given the limited availability of wte most municipalities considering diverting food waste from landfill would likely find co digestion the most attractive management strategy to reduce gwp impact furthermore while gwp benefits are only marginally better for wte systems their non gwp emissions are generally much worse than co digestion systems as seen in fig 1 3 1 5 grid intensity and energy recovery the grid generation source was varied to determine the effects of ghg grid intensity on each system s gwp impact fig 6 converting waste to electricity either through wte or biogas combustion with chp became less favorable as grid intensity decreased both co digestion systems were highly sensitive to grid intensity because they generated the greatest amount of exported electricity from biogas production when the grid source was coal the gwp fossil energy offset for co andmbr and co ad increased by over 80 further improving the net gwp benefit of co digestion when the grid source was solar photovoltaic the gwp fossil energy offset decreased by 70 both co digestion systems had net gwp burdens when grid ghg intensity fell below 0 25 kg co2 eq kwh 1 nonetheless both co digestion systems were still the preferred strategies to handle food waste as they had lower net gwp impacts than landfill ad and compost ad when grid intensity was assumed to be zero i e no ghg credit for electricity generation the benefits of recovering energy from waste primarily in the form of electricity with chp or wte were shown to decline when renewable sources displace fossil fuels for grid electricity which concurs with the results of other studies becker et al 2017 hodge et al 2016 slorach et al 2020 thyberg and tonjes 2017 when accounting for the anticipated decline in grid intensity in the coming decades from coal capacity retirements and additions from renewables useia 2021a an alternative strategy to recover energy from waste should be considered while existing wte facilities are only configured for electricity and heat eere 2019 ad facilities have the flexibility to produce other biofuels such as upgrading biogas to renewable natural gas rng rng is produced by removing co2 and other trace contaminants from biogas and is indistinguishable from fossil natural gas rng can be transported via conventional gas pipelines and used for energy sources other than electricity including high temperature heating and heavy duty transport iea 2020 utilizing rng to displace the use of fossil natural gas for non electricity energy uses is an option to maintain the environmental benefits of energy generated from co digestion when the ghg intensity of the electric grid decreases ardolino et al 2018 slorach et al 2020 this can be particularly useful as the methane potential of landfill material animal manure wastewater and industrial institutional and commercial organic waste in the u s is estimated to be about 450 million gj per year nrel 2013 which can displace about 4 of current industrial gas use or 9 of residential gas use useia 2021b ad systems exporting electricity generated from chp in regions with low ghg grid intensity should consider upgrading biogas to rng to produce a fuel that can offset more ghg intensive energy uses 3 2 benefits and consequences of the novel two phase andmbr system the novel two phase andmbr system had several environmental advantages compared to conventional ad the two phase andmbr was able to achieve a 25 higher methane yield per unit substrate so the system ultimately produced more methane and offset a larger amount of fossil energy than conventional ad the two phase andmbr also had greater solids reduction and thus produced less sludge for disposal in comparison to conventional ad which was beneficial for reducing smog and respiratory emissions associated with incinerating or hauling biosolids smog and respiratory emissions associated with biosolids management for conventional ad were also mitigated if biosolids were land applied locally ad breaks down organic compounds and converts carbon to methane and carbon dioxide a small amount of the nutrients n and p released during that process are utilized for biomass growth while the majority are not removed from the liquid waste stream and must be managed with additional treatment steps for the two phase andmbr over 75 of the n and p available in the influent substrates was discharged with the permeate using model calculations the wastewater nutrient load produced from andmbr permeate and sludge dewatering side streams were estimated to be 750 kg n day 1 and 65 kg p day 1 for andmbr ad and 950 kg n day 1 and 110 kg p day 1 for co andmbr by comparison the wastewater nutrient load for landfill ad was only 15 kg n day 1 and 35 kg p day 1 as the majority of n and p from food waste was retained in the landfill with only a small amount being discharged with the leachate likewise because conventional ad produced more biosolids than the two phase andmbr more nutrients were retained in the biosolids where they offset mineral fertilizer use if land applied with a smaller amount remaining in the wastewater side stream while the eutrophication burden from side stream wastewater generated by the two phase andmbr is ultimately partially offset by the system s energy production this wastewater may create local operational challenges for utilities with stringent n and p requirements when diluted feed is used to achieve low organic loading rates in the two phase andmbr large volumes of side stream wastewater containing nutrients at low concentrations are generated when concentrated feed is used to achieve high organic loading rates low volumes of side stream wastewater with higher nutrient concentrations are generated either scenario has the potential to increase localized eutrophication impacts for utilities when the mainstream nutrient removal system is pushed beyond its design capacity by the additional nutrient load the more stringent nutrient removal wrrf model estimated reductions in the eutrophication burden of wastewater treatment by over 60 in comparison to the baseline wrrf model the use of methanol and fecl3 in the stringent nutrient removal model led to modest increases in smog respiratory and acidification impacts fig s7 even so several low impact nutrient removal technologies exist i e anammox that do not require a supplemental electron donor carbon source or could utilize a portion of the vfas produced by the first phase andmbr hu et al 2012 rodriguez garcia et al 2014 vázquez padín et al 2014 these technologies could be utilized either in the mainstream treatment train or to treat the two phase andmbr effluent separately as a side stream mitigating the eutrophication impact without increasing other emissions directly recovering nutrients from the two phase andmbr permeate could also lead to reductions in impacts associated with wastewater treatment reclaimed water for use in irrigation typically only requires filtration and secondary disinfection usepa 2012 and nutrients in the finished reclaimed water could offset the use of fertilizer future implementation of the two phase andmbr system should consider opportunities to combine it with low impact nutrient removal processes or beneficially reclaim the permeate to recover n and p and reduce impacts associated with wastewater treatment 4 conclusions co management of food waste and sewage sludge by co digestion maximizes resource recovery in the form of biogas production and reduces the environmental impacts of conventional food waste management by offsetting the use of fossil based energy the novel two phase andmbr system included in our analysis has favorable environmental impacts similar to conventional ad for co management of food waste and sewage sludge along with the operational advantage of a much lower hrt this development may allow reconsideration of ad as a strategy to achieve emission reductions from food waste management in municipalities where it has not been practical in the past however increased nutrient loading from the wastewater generated by the two phase andmbr may lead to increases in eutrophication and create local operational challenges for utilities future implementation of the two phase andmbr system should consider coupling it with low impact nutrient removal technologies or reclaiming the wastewater for irrigation to beneficially reuse rather than treat and discharge waste nutrients additional findings include the synergistic benefits of co digestion eliminated the need for naoh for ph control and improved overall system methane yield by 11 22 which significantly reduced the impacts of co andmbr and co ad in comparison to separate mono digestion of food waste and sewage sludge all alternative waste management systems had a 100 likelihood of having a lower gwp impact relative to landfill ad even with an optimal lfg collection and best case utilization rates indicating it is always beneficial to divert food waste from landfills it is more beneficial to divert food waste towards management systems that generate energy because the production of compost humus used to offset mineral fertilizers cannot overcome the environmental burdens of the compost ad system s energy requirements and off gas emissions the global warming benefits of generating energy primarily in the form of electricity from wte or chp are reduced as the ghg intensity of the grid decreases unlike current wte facilities ad facilities have the flexibility to produce other biofuels future

14733,a consequential life cycle assessment lca was utilized to compare the environmental impacts of food waste and sewage sludge management strategies the strategies included a novel two phase anaerobic digestion ad system and alternatives including landfill waste to energy composting anaerobic membrane bioreactor and conventional ad wet continuous stirred tank reactor cstr the co management of food waste with sewage sludge was also considered for the two phase ad system and for a conventional ad reactor a multidimensional lca approach was taken considering the five midpoint impact categories of global warming smog human health particulate acidification and eutrophication estimated using the u s epa tool for the reduction and assessment of chemical and other environmental impacts co management of food waste and sewage sludge using the novel two phase ad system was shown to maximize energy recovery and had a net global warming benefit while reducing other environmental impacts compared with the alternative management strategies it had similar relative environmental advantages across all categories as conventional ad with the advantage of a smaller physical footprint however both approaches featured net environmental burdens when the background electric grid intensity fell below 0 25 kg co2 eq kwh 1 as could be expected in a decarbonized electric future upgrading the biogas produced from ad to renewable natural gas can displace the use of fossil natural gas for other non electricity energy requirements that are difficult to decarbonize and may extend the time period of significant environmental benefits of utilizing ad for organic waste management treatment of the nutrient rich supernatant generated by the novel two phase ad system could be an obstacle for utilities with stringent nutrient discharge limits future research and full scale implementation are needed to demonstrate the benefits of the two phase ad system predicted through this analysis

nutrients from food waste composting creates value from food waste by producing compost humus a soil amendment that can offset the use of mineral fertilizers but the process is net energy consuming thyberg and tonjes 2017 conversely ad generates a fossil energy offset by transforming food waste to electricity and thermal energy through combustion of biogas using combined heat and power chp resulting in a net global warming benefit and the lowest ghg impact among these food waste management strategies hodge et al 2016 lee et al 2020 slorach et al 2020 thyberg and tonjes 2017 despite ad s superior environmental performance in comparison to alternative food waste management strategies only 8 3 of food waste in the u s was managed with ad in 2018 orcr 2018 reasons for the low uptake of wet ad technology for food waste management include concerns about ad stability due to the low buffering capacity of food waste which limits the organic loading rate of the system or requires ph control typically between 6 5 and 7 2 braguglia et al 2018 grady et al 2011a this requires wet ad systems to operate at long retention times 20 40 days to maintain stability which in turn necessitates the use of large digester tanks and heating equipment resulting in high capital costs for ad fonoll et al 2016 kong et al 2016 pramanik et al 2019 xu et al 2018 while dry ad systems usually operate at higher organic loading rates than wet systems the biogas produced per ton of waste treated is lower than in wet ad systems due to the more limited distribution and contact between the substrate and the microbial populations angelonidi and smith 2015 eref 2015 due to these operational challenges dry ad systems have not been as widely implemented as wet systems in the u s eref 2015 co digestion of food waste with primary and secondary sewage sludge from water resource recovery facilities wrrfs has significant potential to improve the energy and nutrient recovery from both waste streams the carbon to nitrogen c n mass ratio of sewage sludge is usually much lower 5 15 than the c n mass ratio considered optimal for ad 20 30 to avoid ammonia inhibition cook et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 the addition of food waste to sewage sludge within anaerobic digesters at wrrfs can increase methane production and yield and improve digester stability by increasing the c n mass ratio moreover the high buffering capacity of sewage sludge is beneficial for co digestion with food waste and limits the ph fluctuations common in food waste mono digestion bolzonella et al 2006 macintosh et al 2019 mata alvarez et al 2014 shen et al 2015 several food waste management studies have assessed the environmental benefits of co digesting food waste and sewage sludge becker et al 2017 edwards et al 2018 iqbal et al 2022 lee et al 2020 these studies have shown that co digestion of food waste with sewage sludge had a lower global warming potential than separate organic waste management because the synergistic effects of co digestion improve methane generation and offset a greater amount of fossil energy novel high rate ad technologies such as anaerobic dynamic membrane bioreactors andmbrs have been developed to address issues associated with conventional ad systems wet continuous stirred tank reactor cstr fed with a total solids content in the substrate below 10 an andmbr harnesses the function of a dynamic membrane a cake layer developed on a mesh support to enhance biomass retention and decouple the solids retention time srt from the hydraulic retention time hrt abbassi guendouz et al 2012 hu et al 2018 this allows andmbrs to operate at a low hrt reducing tank volumes and associated costs in comparison to conventional ad while achieving long srts necessary to support the growth of anaerobic microorganisms and promote complete substrate degradation ersahin et al 2017 a bench scale two phase ad system consisting of two andmbrs was recently developed to advance the use of ad for resource recovery from food waste and other organic waste streams fonoll et al 2023 zhu et al 2022 fig s1 in the supporting information si the first phase andmbr rumen bioreactor was designed to mimic the first stomach of ruminant animals by replicating similar chemical and hydraulic conditions and inoculating with cow rumen content to enhance hydrolysis and acidogenesis for

enhances vfa degradation and methanogenesis by recirculating the permeate through a novel tree shaped dynamic membrane structure that did not require active antifouling measures during a yearlong operation this two phase andmbr system was operated with food waste as the substrate in a bench scale study and achieved a high overall methane yield of 0 5 m3 kg 1 vsfed with an hrt of 6 days fonoll et al 2023 while pilot and industrial level demonstrations are needed to validate results and test full scale operability a holistic understanding of the environmental consequences of using this two phase andmbr system for food waste and sewage sludge management in comparison to conventional ad and other waste management strategies must also be determined the goal of this study was to use environmental life cycle assessment to evaluate alternative food waste management systems and understand if improvements can be achieved by adopting different management strategies and implementing new technology including the use of a novel two phase andmbr system the scope of this evaluation included a comparison of conventional single stream management strategies that do not separate food waste from municipal waste e g landfill and wte and management strategies that consist of separate collection and processing of food waste e g composting conventional ad and the two phase andmbr management of sewage sludge was included in a system expansion to assess the performance of co managing food waste with sludge using conventional ad and the two phase andmbr sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify the key performance parameters contributing to the environmental burdens and benefits of each system comparison of dry ad systems to wet ad systems is left to future work 2 methodology 2 1 functional unit and system boundary the functional unit in this study is the end of life management of food waste and sewage sludge generated by a municipality of 50 000 people in the

impacts were also not considered as construction phase environmental impacts have been shown to be negligible in comparison to operational phase impacts for waste management systems lee et al 2020 rahman et al 2016 useful products generated within each system were considered to replace similar products on the market for example electricity generated from combustion processes including chp and

warming potential gwp measured in kg co2 equivalent eq photochemical smog formation potential measured in kg o3 eq human health respiratory particulate measured in pm 2 5 eq atmospheric acidification potential measured in kg so2 eq and water eutrophication potential measured in kg n eq life cycle impacts were selected based on their relevance as indicators for both global gwp and regional smog respiratory particulate acidification and eutrophication environmental impacts becker et al 2017 edwards et al 2018 lee et al 2020 all impacts were calculated using the u s epa tool for the reduction

of short lived biogenic material ipcc 2006 emissions data for grid electricity fuel use and other energy and material inputs and products generated within the system boundary were taken from greet 1 2019 developed by argonne national laboratory wang et al 2019 and u s lci nrel 2012 table s7 a spreadsheet model was created for each waste management system to calculate mass and energy flows and to quantify the life cycle inventory and environmental impacts 2 3 system descriptions and inventories details relating to the treatment processes of each waste management system used to quantify the life cycle inventory of each system are provided in section 4 of the si inventory data for each system is provided in section 6 of the si all system models considered biogas and lfg to be utilized on site with a chp unit to generate electricity and thermal energy an average biogas capture efficiency of 96 for ad systems was selected liebetrau et al 2017 average factors for lfg utilization rates were used for decaying food waste 51 6 of lfg captured for energy recovery 16 5 flared or oxidized to neutral biogenic co2 and the remaining 31 9 escaped to the atmosphere levis and barlaz 2014 digester sludge was dewatered to form biosolids which were assumed to be disposed of according to aggregate biosolids practices in the u s 51 land applied 33 to landfill 16 to incineration usepa n d municipal wastewater reclamation is uncommon in the u s usepa 2012 accordingly side streams including permeate produced from the two phase andmbr and supernatant generated during sludge dewatering were treated as wastewater and sent to a wrrf that was assumed to achieve a final nutrient effluent quality of 8 mg l 1 total n and 1 mg l 1 total p before discharge to a receiving waterway details provided in section 4 4 of the si to account for scenarios with more stringent wastewater discharge requirements an alternate stringent nutrient removal wrrf model assumed to achieve a final effluent quality of 3 mg l 1 total n and 0 1 mg l 1 total p was developed results for modeling wastewater treatment with stringent nutrient removal are provided in fig s7 s8 for the single stream food waste management systems landfill ad and wte ad food waste did not require separation from the municipal solid waste stream landfill activities included in the system boundary were the energy inputs needed to operate the landfill the capture and utilization of lfg for power and heat generation the treatment of landfill leachate and the emissions from escaped lfg the landfill methane yield of food waste was assumed to be 0 4 m3 ch4 kg 1 dry food waste and methane landfill emissions were considered over a 100 year time horizon to encompass all of the potential emissions from decaying waste levis and barlaz 2014 it was assumed that 1 kg of food waste would produce 2 10 4 m3 of landfill leachate kurniawan and lo 2009 which is captured as wastewater and sent to a wrrf for the wte system the material inputs required for air pollution controls and estimates of stack emissions were adapted from the model derived by harrison et al 2000 the energy released from waste incineration was recovered to generate electricity exported to the grid and thermal energy for use offsite bottom ash from incineration was estimated to be 0 018 kg ash kg 1 food waste hegde and trabold 2019 disposal of bottom ash was modeled as being transported to an ash landfill where it was assumed to be inert source separated system models compost ad andmbr ad and ad ad assumed food waste had been pre sorted to remove contaminants the compost model was adapted from the default compost process model derived by levis and barlaz 2013 which considered the use of windrow turners during active composting and curing windrow composting is the most common method of composting in the u s composting council 2023 compost humus was produced by mixing water and sawdust with food waste and energy inputs were needed to operate the composting facility output flows from the compost facility included air emissions from curing off gasses ch4 n2o nh3 and vocs the finished humus was transported for land application to offset the use of mineral fertilizers the two phase andmbr food waste model required food waste to be mixed with water to create a slurry with a 3 0 total solids concentration the first phase andmbr had an hrt of 0 5 days to achieve an organic loading rate of 40 kg vs m 3 d 1 permeate from the first phase andmbr was fed to the second phase r andmbr the r andmbr had an hrt of 5 days to achieve an organic loading rate of 4 kg vs m 3 d 1 to account for the operational uncertainty of the loading rate for the novel two phase system the solids feed rate was varied between 1 to 5 as part of the uncertainty analysis naoh was added to the first phase andmbr at a rate of 0 04 kg dry naoh kg 1 food waste to maintain a ph above 6 2 which also helped maintain the ph in the second phase r andmbr around 7 2 the two phase system s methane yield was assumed to be 0 50 m3 ch4 kg 1 vsfed fonoll et al 2023 methane emissions included assumed emissions for fugitive biogas from the digesters and chp unit as well as dissolved methane from the r andmbr permeate and sludge supernatant according to the calculations described in section 4 of the si conventional mono digestion of food waste was modeled using a single phase mesophilic continuous stirred tank reactor cstr food waste was mixed with water to create a slurry with a 7 5 total solids concentration to achieve an organic loading rate of 1 9 kg vs m 3 d 1 the ad model included the use of naoh at a rate of 0 04 kg dry naoh kg 1 food waste to counteract ph fluctuations due to the accumulation of vfas the methane yield was approximated as 0 40 m3 ch4 kg 1 vsfed hegde and trabold 2019 nagao et al 2012 zhang et al 2007 conventional mono digestion of sewage sludge was modeled as a single stage mesophilic cstr fed with a 4 0 total solids concentration and methane yield of 0 25 m3 ch4 kg 1 vsfed tchobanoglous et al 1991 to account for the operational benefits of co digestion the two phase and conventional ad systems were also modeled considering the co management of food waste with sewage sludge co andmbr and co ad as further detailed in section 4 of the si co digestion was assumed to eliminate the need for water and naoh as sewage sludge acts as a sufficient dilutant and ph buffer both co andmbr and co ad were also assumed to be fed a substrate with a higher percentage of solids than their corresponding mono digestion systems the baseline systems were modeled as being fed an influent with a 7 total solids concentration 55 food waste 45 sewage sludge by dry mass assuming 100 of food waste was diverted from landfill to co digestion conventional co digestion of food waste with sewage sludge has been shown to achieve a methane yield of about 0 40 m3 ch4 kg 1 vsfed bolzonella et al 2006 holliger et al 2017 similar to that achieved for conventional mono digestion of food waste therefore the co digestion methane yields were assumed to be 0 40 m3 ch4 kg 1 vsfed and 0 50 m3 ch4 kg 1 vsfed for co ad and co andmbr respectively for co andmbr sludge from the first phase andmbr produced from digesting food waste and sewage sludge would not meet current epa class b biosolids requirements because of the reactor s low srt walker et al 1994 so biosolids were modeled as being sent only to landfill 67 and incineration 33 2 4 uncertainty and sensitivity analysis a monte carlo analysis 10 000 simulations was performed to account for the uncertainties within each system model table 2 the majority of uncertainty parameters were associated with the ad process models a triangular distribution was assumed for uncertainty parameters with a most likely midpoint value while a uniform distribution was used in the absence of a midpoint estimate a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate each system s global warming performance depending on the i percentage of food waste diverted from municipal waste and ii electric grid generation source source separated food waste management systems were evaluated assuming a food waste diversion percentage of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 with remaining food waste being sent to landfill landfill and wte were not evaluated for varying degrees of food waste diversion as neither system would require food waste to be separated from the municipal waste stream the ghg intensity of grid electricity consumed by a system process or credited as an offset for excess electricity generation was varied based on generation source electricity generation sources evaluated included coal natural gas the 2018 u s national grid mix used for the baseline models and solar photovoltaic the fuel cycle ghg emissions for electricity corresponding to each source were 1 05 0 50 0 48 and 0 kg co2 eq kwh 1 respectively wang et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 life cycle environmental impacts of waste management system models fig 1 shows the environmental impacts of each waste management system for comparison the impacts are normalized to the net impacts of landfill ad currently the most common food waste management system the contribution of individual unit processes within each waste management system is shown in fig 2 impacts for source separated and co managed systems assumed 100 of food waste was diverted from landfill to the respective system table s18 all alternative management systems had a lower net gwp impact than landfill ad for other emissions wte ad and source separated systems had higher net impacts than landfill ad while the co managed systems generally had impacts lower than or comparable to landfill ad a comparison of this study s results to other studies that evaluated management methods for both food waste and sewage sludge is presented in table s21 3 1 1 co managed systems the co digestion systems that manage food waste and sewage sludge together co ad and co andmbr maximized resource recovery in the form of energy as methane and had the greatest decrease in gwp impacts in comparison to landfill ad co andmbr and co ad had the greatest net energy returns fig 3 which offset the use of fossil fuels for electricity and thermal energy generation and was the primary benefit for minimizing net environmental burdens for all emissions the sum of offset emissions from net electricity and thermal energy generation was about 1 5 times greater than the sum of gwp burdens for co andmbr and co ad a system is considered to have a net environmental benefit when the sum of offsets is greater than the sum of burdens co ad had net environmental benefits for gwp and acidification and co andmbr had net environmental benefits for gwp smog respiratory and acidification fugitive methane emissions had the greatest contribution to the gwp burden for both co digestion models escaped biogas accounted for 90 of fugitive methane whereas dissolved methane in wastewater accounted for 10 of emissions biogas capture efficiency which has been reported to range from between 93 to virtually 100 liebetrau et al 2017 was the largest source of gwp uncertainty fig s6 escaped biogas directly increased gwp burdens and indirectly decreased gwp benefits from the loss of potential energy generation from biogas combustion decreasing biogas capture efficiency from 96 to 93 increased net gwp impacts by over 75 in practice ensuring a high capture efficiency of biogas from ad systems is critical to maximizing resource recovery and mitigating gwp impacts additional parameters related to energy generation including the percent of usable heat output and digester methane yield were also strong contributors to gwp uncertainty eliminating the potential to export excess heat generated from chp reduced the gwp offset for co andmbr and co ad by 31 and 27 respectively removing the thermal energy offset increased net emissions across all system models particularly those that included chp or wte to manage food waste but did not significantly alter the normalized net impacts of each waste management system across all environmental impacts considered when accounting for model uncertainty co andmbr had an 81 or higher likelihood of achieving a smaller gwp than all single stream and source separated systems when compared to co ad co andmbr had a 50 likelihood of achieving a lower gwp but had a greater than 92 likelihood of achieving a lower smog respiratory and acidification impact fig 4 3 1 2 source separated systems both mono digestion systems andmbr ad and ad ad had higher environmental burdens than the co digestion systems because of the emissions related to the production of naoh used to control ph in the food waste digester the co digestion systems avoided this added burden because sewage sludge acted as a sufficient dilutant and ph buffer eliminating the need for naoh likewise the synergistic benefits of co digestion increased overall methane yield from the combined organic waste streams leading to greater methane production and a larger energy offset the increase in methane production resulted in a 28 and 18 increase in net electricity generation for co andmbr and co ad over andmbr ad and ad ad respectively co management of food waste with sewage sludge was superior to separate mono digestion of each waste because co digestion avoided the burdens associated with naoh and improved energy recovery by more efficiently converting substrate to methane compost ad had the second highest gwp impact among all waste management systems fertilizer offsets associated with land applying compost humus and biosolids only offset 6 of the system s total gwp burden and was even less for other impacts evaluated mirroring other studies that found minimal emission reductions from offsetting the use of mineral fertilizers hodge et al 2016 thyberg and tonjes 2017 because of the low contributions of fertilizer offsets the potential efficiency differences between mineral and organic fertilizer were not considered in this calculation as it would make a negligible impact on the result the results indicate that energy generation using wte or ad is preferable to nutrient recovery as compost for food waste management likewise land application of biosolids offset less than 5 of each system s total burdens across all environmental impacts land application of biosolids was still preferable to disposing to landfills or incineration because those processes produce added environmental burdens off gas emissions from the composter contributed the greatest burdens for gwp smog acidification eutrophication and respiratory emissions for compost ad similar to the findings of other studies that evaluated composting becker et al 2017 3 1 3 single stream systems wte ad had a net gwp benefit attributed to energy production offsets and had a lower gwp impact than the source separated systems and was comparable to the co managed systems however wte ad had high burdens compared to other systems for all other environmental impacts besides gwp air pollutants associated with direct air emissions from incineration and the production emissions for the materials needed for pollution controls i e lime and ammonia accounted for the majority of the system s burdens across all impacts landfill ad had the greatest net gwp impact among all systems fugitive methane emissions accounted for 92 of the gwp burdens and net energy production from biogas and lfg combustion displaced less than half of the system s gwp burdens lfg capture efficiency is highly dependent on the age of the landfill cell and cell cover type hodge et al 2016 levis and barlaz 2014 the lfg capture efficiency may range from only 35 for an active cell during initial waste burial to 90 for a cell with a geomembrane final cover spokas et al 2006 as food waste is readily degradable methane emissions are difficult to capture because food waste is degraded before an effective cover can be applied to the landfill cell an analysis by levis and barlaz 2014 concluded that the lifetime utilization of lfg from food waste for energy generation may vary between 22 2 65 4 depending on the waste decay rate and landfill regulatory requirements compared to the baseline landfill ad model with an average lfg utilization of 51 6 a poorly managed landfill with a lifetime lfg utilization rate of only 22 2 had twofold greater net gwp impact whereas a state of the art landfill with a lifetime lfg utilization rate of 65 4 had a gwp impact that was only half as large fig s6 the landfill ad model still had the highest net gwp impact among all waste management systems when considering a 65 4 lfg utilization rate landfill ad ranked among the lowest net impacts for all other environmental emissions minimal energy and material inputs were required to operate the landfill and pollutants from lfg and leachate other than methane discharged to air or water were relatively minor 3 1 4 impact of food waste diversion rates the sensitivity analysis accounted for food waste diversion rates for source separated management systems fig 5 diverting any amount of food waste from landfill yielded gwp reductions indicating landfill gas collection systems for capture of biogas from decaying organic wastes are not an ideal management strategy in comparison to alternatives however the alternate single stream system wte ad had a lower net gwp impact than compost ad andmbr ad and ad ad even when 100 of food waste was diverted similarly both co digestion systems did not achieve the same net gwp benefit as wte ad until over 90 of food waste was diverted considering the maximum food waste sorting efficiency is reported to be only 80 edwards et al 2018 it is unlikely that over 90 of food waste would be separated from the municipal waste stream consequently it may not be advantageous from a gwp perspective for municipalities already managing municipal waste with wte to separate food waste findings that mirror other studies that have evaluated wte hodge et al 2016 thyberg and tonjes 2017 however access to wte is limited over half of the 77 wte facilities that exist in the u s are concentrated in the northeast and only one new wte plant has been built since 1995 large capital costs for modern wte plants competition with cheaper electricity sources and low landfill tipping rates have largely prohibited the deployment of wte eere 2019 conversely over 2200 sites in the u s produce biogas via ad including over 1200 wrrfs eere 2019 co digestion has been shown to have the most economical life cycle cost for food waste management in comparison to wte compost and landfill lee et al 2020 ad also presents an opportunity to produce high value biofuels other than electricity and thermal energy given the limited availability of wte most municipalities considering diverting food waste from landfill would likely find co digestion the most attractive management strategy to reduce gwp impact furthermore while gwp benefits are only marginally better for wte systems their non gwp emissions are generally much worse than co digestion systems as seen in fig 1 3 1 5 grid intensity and energy recovery the grid generation source was varied to determine the effects of ghg grid intensity on each system s gwp impact fig 6 converting waste to electricity either through wte or biogas combustion with chp became less favorable as grid intensity decreased both co digestion systems were highly sensitive to grid intensity because they generated the greatest amount of exported electricity from biogas production when the grid source was coal the gwp fossil energy offset for co andmbr and co ad increased by over 80 further improving the net gwp benefit of co digestion when the grid source was solar photovoltaic the gwp fossil energy offset decreased by 70 both co digestion systems had net gwp burdens when grid ghg intensity fell below 0 25 kg co2 eq kwh 1 nonetheless both co digestion systems were still the preferred strategies to handle food waste as they had lower net gwp impacts than landfill ad and compost ad when grid intensity was assumed to be zero i e no ghg credit for electricity generation the benefits of recovering energy from waste primarily in the form of electricity with chp or wte were shown to decline when renewable sources displace fossil fuels for grid electricity which concurs with the results of other studies becker et al 2017 hodge et al 2016 slorach et al 2020 thyberg and tonjes 2017 when accounting for the anticipated decline in grid intensity in the coming decades from coal capacity retirements and additions from renewables useia 2021a an alternative strategy to recover energy from waste should be considered while existing wte facilities are only configured for electricity and heat eere 2019 ad facilities have the flexibility to produce other biofuels such as upgrading biogas to renewable natural gas rng rng is produced by removing co2 and other trace contaminants from biogas and is indistinguishable from fossil natural gas rng can be transported via conventional gas pipelines and used for energy sources other than electricity including high temperature heating and heavy duty transport iea 2020 utilizing rng to displace the use of fossil natural gas for non electricity energy uses is an option to maintain the environmental benefits of energy generated from co digestion when the ghg intensity of the electric grid decreases ardolino et al 2018 slorach et al 2020 this can be particularly useful as the methane potential of landfill material animal manure wastewater and industrial institutional and commercial organic waste in the u s is estimated to be about 450 million gj per year nrel 2013 which can displace about 4 of current industrial gas use or 9 of residential gas use useia 2021b ad systems exporting electricity generated from chp in regions with low ghg grid intensity should consider upgrading biogas to rng to produce a fuel that can offset more ghg intensive energy uses 3 2 benefits and consequences of the novel two phase andmbr system the novel two phase andmbr system had several environmental advantages compared to conventional ad the two phase andmbr was able to achieve a 25 higher methane yield per unit substrate so the system ultimately produced more methane and offset a larger amount of fossil energy than conventional ad the two phase andmbr also had greater solids reduction and thus produced less sludge for disposal in comparison to conventional ad which was beneficial for reducing smog and respiratory emissions associated with incinerating or hauling biosolids smog and respiratory emissions associated with biosolids management for conventional ad were also mitigated if biosolids were land applied locally ad breaks down organic compounds and converts carbon to methane and carbon dioxide a small amount of the nutrients n and p released during that process are utilized for biomass growth while the majority are not removed from the liquid waste stream and must be managed with additional treatment steps for the two phase andmbr over 75 of the n and p available in the influent substrates was discharged with the permeate using model calculations the wastewater nutrient load produced from andmbr permeate and sludge dewatering side streams were estimated to be 750 kg n day 1 and 65 kg p day 1 for andmbr ad and 950 kg n day 1 and 110 kg p day 1 for co andmbr by comparison the wastewater nutrient load for landfill ad was only 15 kg n day 1 and 35 kg p day 1 as the majority of n and p from food waste was retained in the landfill with only a small amount being discharged with the leachate likewise because conventional ad produced more biosolids than the two phase andmbr more nutrients were retained in the biosolids where they offset mineral fertilizer use if land applied with a smaller amount remaining in the wastewater side stream while the eutrophication burden from side stream wastewater generated by the two phase andmbr is ultimately partially offset by the system s energy production this wastewater may create local operational challenges for utilities with stringent n and p requirements when diluted feed is used to achieve low organic loading rates in the two phase andmbr large volumes of side stream wastewater containing nutrients at low concentrations are generated when concentrated feed is used to achieve high organic loading rates low volumes of side stream wastewater with higher nutrient concentrations are generated either scenario has the potential to increase localized eutrophication impacts for utilities when the mainstream nutrient removal system is pushed beyond its design capacity by the additional nutrient load the more stringent nutrient removal wrrf model estimated reductions in the eutrophication burden of wastewater treatment by over 60 in comparison to the baseline wrrf model the use of methanol and fecl3 in the stringent nutrient removal model led to modest increases in smog respiratory and acidification impacts fig s7 even so several low impact nutrient removal technologies exist i e anammox that do not require a supplemental electron donor carbon source or could utilize a portion of the vfas produced by the first phase andmbr hu et al 2012 rodriguez garcia et al 2014 vázquez padín et al 2014 these technologies could be utilized either in the mainstream treatment train or to treat the two phase andmbr effluent separately as a side stream mitigating the eutrophication impact without increasing other emissions directly recovering nutrients from the two phase andmbr permeate could also lead to reductions in impacts associated with wastewater treatment reclaimed water for use in irrigation typically only requires filtration and secondary disinfection usepa 2012 and nutrients in the finished reclaimed water could offset the use of fertilizer future implementation of the two phase andmbr system should consider opportunities to combine it with low impact nutrient removal processes or beneficially reclaim the permeate to recover n and p and reduce impacts associated with wastewater treatment 4 conclusions co management of food waste and sewage sludge by co digestion maximizes resource recovery in the form of biogas production and reduces the environmental impacts of conventional food waste management by offsetting the use of fossil based energy the novel two phase andmbr system included in our analysis has favorable environmental impacts similar to conventional ad for co management of food waste and sewage sludge along with the operational advantage of a much lower hrt this development may allow reconsideration of ad as a strategy to achieve emission reductions from food waste management in municipalities where it has not been practical in the past however increased nutrient loading from the wastewater generated by the two phase andmbr may lead to increases in eutrophication and create local operational challenges for utilities future implementation of the two phase andmbr system should consider coupling it with low impact nutrient removal technologies or reclaiming the wastewater for irrigation to beneficially reuse rather than treat and discharge waste nutrients additional findings include the synergistic benefits of co digestion eliminated the need for naoh for ph control and improved overall system methane yield by 11 22 which significantly reduced the impacts of co andmbr and co ad in comparison to separate mono digestion of food waste and sewage sludge all alternative waste management systems had a 100 likelihood of having a lower gwp impact relative to landfill ad even with an optimal lfg collection and best case utilization rates indicating it is always beneficial to divert food waste from landfills it is more beneficial to divert food waste towards management systems that generate energy because the production of compost humus used to offset mineral fertilizers cannot overcome the environmental burdens of the compost ad system s energy requirements and off gas emissions the global warming benefits of generating energy primarily in the form of electricity from wte or chp are reduced as the ghg intensity of the grid decreases unlike current wte facilities ad facilities have the flexibility to produce other biofuels future

14734,sewage sludge ss management remains a challenge across the world we quantified the potential climate change impacts of eight conventional technology configurations tcs for ss treatment and disposal by considering four different energy exchanges and using a life cycle assessment lca model that employed uncertainty distributions for 104 model parameters all tcs showed large climate change loads and savings net values ranging from 123 to 1148 kg co2 eq t ts when the energy exchange was with a fossil based energy system whereas loads and savings were approximately three times lower when the energy exchange was with a renewable energy system uncertainty associated with the climate change results was more than 100 with fossil energy exchange and low ts content of ss but was lower for renewable energy landfilling had the greatest climate change impact while thermal drying with incineration had the highest probability of providing better climate change performance than other tcs the global sensitivity analysis identified nine critical technological parameters many of them can be easily measured for relevant ss and technology levels to improve specific estimates of climate change impact when all scenarios were optimized to the 20 best cases thermal drying with incineration outperformed the other tcs this paper contributes to better quantifying the climate change impacts of different technologies used for sludge treatment given changing energy systems and identifies crucial parameters for further technological development graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge climate change life cycle assessment uncertainty and sensitivity analysis treatment and disposal technology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sewage sludge ss management is a challenge due to the large quantities of ss produced daily by municipal wastewater treatment plants worldwide ding et al 2021 various ss treatment and disposal technologies have been developed in different contexts taking into account factors such as scale economic efficiency and social norms however it is important to assess the environmental performance of different treatment and disposal technologies and identify the determinants of environmentally optimal solutions conventional technologies for treating and disposing of ss include biological treatments such as anaerobic digestion and composting and thermal treatments such as incineration and landfill disposal kacprzak et al 2017 nevertheless the specific utilization of these technologies varies depending on the regions and countries as example in europe approximately 14 million tons of sludge on a dry basis were produced in 2020 havukainen et al 2022 among the eu 27 countries 28 of the sludge was landfilled primarily in eastern europe where poland and romania landfilled over 50 of their sludge conversely more than 20 countries in central and western europe employed anaerobic digestion composting and incineration notably 35 of the sludge in france was composted while 69 was incinerated in germany kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 chojnacka et al 2023 in china annually producing approximately 11 million tons of sludge on dry basis mohurd china 2021 approximately 15 applied to the land direct land application or post composting 20 incinerated and 65 landfilled dai 2020 ss treatment and disposal involves a sequence of technologies and operations such as anaerobic digestion followed by composting and land application or drying followed by incineration and landfilling of the ashes choices relating to these sequences hereinafter called technological configurations tcs depend on several issues such as the contamination level of the sludge economy technology availability land availability and environmental impacts with increasing international focus on limiting climate change impacts united nations 2015 all sectors of society must contribute including sewage sludge treatment and disposal facilities it was estimated that in 2019 chinese sludge treatment emitted 10 8 million tons of co2 eq into the atmosphere wei et al 2020 technological diversity and variations in tcs present challenges in selecting the best way to manage ss in this context the potential climate change impacts of different tcs is an important indicator for comparison life cycle assessment lca is a standardized method iso 14040 2006 used to systematically compare the potential environmental impacts of technologies and systems several studies have used lcas to assess the climate change impacts of sludge management technologies ding et al 2021 for instance reviewed 37 studies published in 2010 2020 on sludge management lca with a focus on nutrient and energy recovery but this study did not provide the findings regarding climate change more recent papers however have applied lcas in this context mayer et al 2021 found that in germany after anaerobic digestion digestate applied to the land performed better than incinerating digested sludge other high temperature treatment options were also less attractive than the direct use of digestate on land mainardis et al 2021 showed an italian case that thermal drying prior to land application increased climate change impact whereas the same treatment prior to incineration was the better alternative from a climate change perspective havukainen et al 2022 found that in finland for dewatered sludge incineration was better than composting however this study highlighted the significant uncertainty associated with the results morsink georgali et al 2022 found that anaerobic digestion was significantly better than composting emerging treatment technologies have also been addressed for example lozano et al 2022 and luo et al 2021 dealt with high temperature processes the large variations in what has been found to be optimal technologies illustrate that lca results strongly depend on the goal and scope of the study as well as the assumptions and system boundaries christensen et al 2020 recommendations in the current literature based on studies in which not all tcs for sewage sludge management and disposal were examined under the same conditions e g the energy system in which tcs operate thereby preventing direct comparisons between results and especially identifying the factors that determine environmentally optimal tc moreover we have not been able to identify any thorough assessments of climate change impacts of the most commonly used sludge technologies that pay systematic attention to the uncertainty associated with parameters used in modelling as well as the future changes in climate changes depending on the energy systems applied the first aspect namely model parameter uncertainty is often neglected probably due to lack of data on the statistical distributions of key parameters however according to recent data reviews chang et al 2022a 2022b 2023a chang et al 2023b inventory data vary so much that lca modelling using single value parameters can be potentially misleading and the results offer inaccurate conclusions in preparing to choose a sludge technology accurate data on technology performance are rarely available and lca modelling often uses general data from literature but does not consider the uncertainty associated with them the second aspect i e energy used or recovered in sludge treatment has been shown in several studies to affect climate change impacts zhao et al 2022 but no studies consider the fact that the energy systems with which sludge management technologies interact will change dramatically in the future as renewable energy sources are introduced many countries have political ambitions of being fossil free by 2050 and investments made in sludge technologies today are likely to last beyond 2050 and thus will see a dramatic change in energy systems this implies that the climate change loads and savings which pertain to the impacts resulting from and avoided by the management of energy exchanges in sewage sludge will differ in the future the term energy exchanges will be used to discuss these implications the objective of this paper is to provide a consistent and transparent assessment of the potential climate change impacts of conventional tcs for managing municipal sewage sludge using the lca methodology the consistency of the assessment entails evaluating a range of tcs based on the same conditions and assumptions for lca modelling and paying proper attention to model parameter uncertainty and different energy exchanges the study aims to quantify the ambiguity around climate change impacts caused by both model input values and modelling choices we used statistically significant data published in the literature on sludge composition dewatering anaerobic digestion composting incineration landfilling and the land application of sewage sludge the expected outcomes include the quantitative climate change impacts of different sludge treatment technologies in view of changing energy systems additionally we identify the critical sensitive technological parameters for which accurate information is crucial and potential optimization is promising for further technological development the latter approach may inspire and assist in the further development of relevant technologies and can be used to target key data for case specific studies 2 materials and methods this section provides data for a systematic comparison of conventional management options for sewage sludge starting with a common composition of the sludge material it is carried out as an lca and an analysis of result robustness in particular the study used input distribution values in the model derived from thorough literature reviews chang et al 2022a 2022b 2023a 2023b in order to assess the sensitivity and uncertainty of the model results 2 1 sewage sludge composition treated municipal sewage sludge is thickened and has an average composition derived from the review by chang et al 2022a referring to 162 studies the characteristics are 3 3 ts 68 vs of ts 32 ash of ts 53 c of vs 7 n of vs 7 p of ash 2 k of ash and 22 mj kg dry vs as the lower heating value lhv a detailed composition is presented in supporting information si in tracking substances through the sludge treatment system we assume that n is linked to vs while p and k are linked to ash according to their existing forms chang et al 2022a huang et al 2017 kulikowska and gusiatin 2015 according to chang et al 2022a the 53 c in the vs is typically 45 biogenic c and 8 fossil c the latter of which is considered non degradable but fully combustible 2 2 technological configurations tc we consider eight different tcs tcs 1 8 all of which are conventional well established and used in full scale applications the technologies included dewatering drying composting anaerobic digestion incineration landfilling land use after composting only ash landfilling after incineration only and wastewater treatment after dewatering and drying the tcs are listed in table 1 showing the included technologies and main deliveries the main flows are shown in fig 1 2 3 technology description the conventional sludge treatment technologies considered are described in si in terms of inventory data which in terms of data distribution are mainly based on large amounts of parameter statistics compiled in our previous studies brief descriptions of the core technologies and key data relevant to mass flows and climate change impact quantification are provided below 2 3 1 anaerobic digestion ad sewage sludge digestion is a process that occurs under anaerobic conditions at elevated temperatures and involving prolonged mixing according to chang et al 2023a approximately 48 12 of biogenic carbon undergoes conversion into biogas during digestion resulting in the production of 248 76 m3 methane ch4 per t vs with 64 5 ch4 content the losses of biogas from the digester are estimated to be an average of 7 5 following a lognormal distribution of ld 1 8 0 7 as reported by scheutz and fredenslund 2019 around 38 7 of the biogas is converted to electricity while 41 3 16 5 is utilized for heat based on the lhv of biogas this results in the production of 9763 324 kwh of electricity and 3779 1868 mj of heat per ton vs the overall energy consumption for this process is estimated to be 111 61 mj per t wet weight input according to chang et al 2023a with electricity accounting for 59 heat for 29 and diesel for 12 as per yoshida et al 2015 additionally the loss of vs is approximately 2 7 kg per kg of biogenic carbon loss following a lognormal distribution of ld 0 84 0 56 which corresponds to a degradation of 46 11 of vs finally the resulting digestate which constitutes 29 9 0 3 kg t ts undergoes dewatering 2 3 2 dewatering dw mechanical dewatering typically performed using centrifuges or filter presses is commonly augmented by the addition of coagulating or flocculating polymer chang et al 2023b the consumption of flocculating polymer for both raw and digested sludge follows a normal distribution with average values of 7 0 4 2 kg t ts input and 10 6 4 6 kg t ts input respectively likewise electricity consumption also adheres to a normal distribution with average values of 1 7 0 2 kwh t wet weight input for raw sludge and 7 3 1 2 kwh t wet weight input for digested sludge the extracted water is subsequently treated in a wastewater treatment plant using the activated sludge method as described in supporting information si section s1 7 2 3 3 thermal drying tdr thermal drying tdr is modelled as a belt dryer utilizing heat to raise the drying temperature above 100 c heat recovery achieved through a heat exchanger captures approximately 65 80 of vapor energy during the drying process approximately 7 6 5 3 of the vs content is lost assuming that the transfer coefficient of c to the exhaust air is equivalent to that of vs the c is released as co2 into the air energy consumption is estimated to be 2 2 1 0 mj per kg wet weight with heat accounting for 82 and electricity for 18 as reported by chang et al 2023b 2 3 4 incineration inc incineration is modelled as a fluidized bed reactor with air pollution controls and for electricity and heat recovery the resulting bottom and fly ash from the process are disposed into landfills the lhv is estimated to be 2 9 1 2 mj kg wet weight for dewatered raw sludge and 11 5 2 7 mj kg wet weight for dried raw sludge the electricity and heat uses are 0 42 0 37 kwh kg ts and 7 8 5 8 mj kg ts for dewatered sludge and 0 36 0 37 kwh kg ts and 0 9 1 2 mj kg ts for dried sludge based on data compiled by chang et al 2022b furthermore the same data indicates that the electricity recovery is approximately 10 8 4 5 and heat recovery is 49 8 12 1 of the lhv 2 3 5 composting cp composting is modelled as turned windrows with air input and the resulting compost is utilized on land as described in si in this modelling approach no off gas control system is taken into account and the use and fate of bulking agents are omitted to maintain consistency within the system during composting vs undergo degradation with a degradation rate of 55 2 22 7 for dewatered raw sludge and 43 4 23 5 for dewatered digested sludge as compiled by chang et al 2023a methane is emitted from the windrows at a rate of 0 0081 0 0077 kg kg ts diesel is consumed for turning the windrows with a rate of 0 0069 0 0078 kg kg ts additionally electricity usage amounts to 0 11 0 07 kwh kg ts for air input and mechanical equipment the reported data originate from one full scale plant as reported by chang et al 2023a 2 3 6 landfill lf landfilling is modelled as a typical modern landfill that incorporates landfill gas and leachate controls sewage sludge is assumed to be landfilled and mixed with municipal solid waste the study considers operations and emissions for 100 years after landfilling manfredi and christensen 2009 the landfill modelling incorporates gas generation which is based on volatile solids vs in the sewage sludge and utilizes a first order degradation constant k 0 3194 year 1 following the approach outlined by zhu and zhao s 2011 any biogenic carbon that remains unemitted within 100 year period is sequestered and considered a climate change saving gas is collected for 55 years with varying efficiency levels for the first three years it s the collection efficiency is 45 followed by 70 efficiency for the subsequent 12 years the remaining 40 years of gas collection exhibit an efficiency of 85 as a result approximately 39 of the generated gas is emitted james and morton 2017 wang et al 2020 and no methane oxidation occurs in the top cover zhao et al 2022 of the collected gas 87 is utilized for electricity production with an efficiency of 37 of the gas lhv additionally 9 of the collected gas is flared and 4 is vented zhao et al 2022 the study also accounts for fuel consumption related to landfill operation of 0 3 kg t wet weight zhao et al 2022 and leachate treatment which uses 24 kwh t leachate for 100 years details in si 2 4 life cycle assessment lca lca is used to quantify the climate change impacts of the eight tcs the principles used are in accordance with the iso14040 standard iso 2006 and ilcd guidelines ilcd 2010 recommendations the functional unit is the treatment and disposal of one ton 1000 kg of the ts content of thickened municipal sewage sludge set at 3 3 ts water content 96 7 and corresponding to a sludge wet weight of 30 300 kg chang et al 2022a in some of the sensitivity analyses we change the ts content and thus accordingly change the wet mass of the actual ts the time scope for the study is 2025 2050 while the time horizon for emission accounting as well as for climate change characterization factors for 100 years and 20 years in addition to the technologies described in the tcs the system boundary also includes transporting thickened sludge see si for each technology energy and material consumption as well as energy and nutrient recovery is included we apply system expansion following key lca principles by subtracting the alternative products that are avoided when energy and nutrients are recovered within the system impacts related to facility construction are excluded tc process modelling and climate change impact quantification were carried out with easetech model v3 4 4 clavreul et al 2014 while the ecoinvent database substitution consequential long term version 3 8 was used for background data on material and energy consumption and substitution the study uses consequential lca principles and the specific datasets used are found in si global warming potentials are quantified for greenhouse gases for the 20 year and 100 year time horizons provided in the sixth assessment report of intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2021 table 2 lists the characterization factors considered in this study christensen et al 2009 2 5 interpretation of the lca results 2 5 1 uncertainty analysis and parameter sensitivity analysis lca model input values result uncertainty in relation to the model input values was quantified with uncertainty propagation the model s input values were represented with probability distributions and these parameters were utilized in a monte carlo simulation facilitated by easetech which included 10 000 samples from the parameter distributions thus yielding 10 000 lcia result scores clavreul et al 2012 the samples were taken dependently i e the sampled values were the same for each run of parameters shared between tcs distributions obtained from the monte carlo simulation reflect the uncertainty of the lca results the distributions were further analyzed for expected value and interquartile ranges as well as for a pair wise comparison of the assessed tcs through discernibility analysis heijungs and kleijn 2001 in order to calculate pair wise probability measures of one tc performing better than another global sensitivity analysis was used to analyze the fundamental connections between result sensitivity and the uncertainty of individual model parameters and to calculate the contribution of each parameter to the lca results uncertainty bisinella et al 2016 details in section s2 of si from the monte carlo simulations best practice cases with the top 20 cumulative probability excluding 5 extreme data in terms of climate change were identified to represent potential targets for improving each tc s technologies 2 5 2 parameter distributions the model is based on 104 technological parameters each represented by a distribution see table s3 in si for details distributions associated with the parameters show significant variations and skewness thereby illustrating the limitations of representing such parameters with a single value nine parameters identified in table 3 were very sensitive in general based on the later robustness assessment and their distributions are presented in fig 2 2 5 3 scenario sensitivity analysis scenario variation describes how the results of a scenario vary subject to changes in boundary conditions or imports exports over the boundary we considered different energy exchanges as well as the ts and vs content of the sludge we also evaluated both 20 year and 100 year climate change characterization factors energy exchange scenarios all tcs use energy but some also recover it we account for the use and recovery of energy separately although some plants may use the produced energy internally however since we assign the same climate change impact to the use and recovery of energy the net result is not affected we consider four different energy electricity kwh and heat mj exchanges ranging from 100 fossil 0 984 kg co2 eq kwh 0 111 kg co2 eq mj over two transient exchanges of 55 fossil 0 56 kg co2 eq kwh 0 111 kg co2 eq mj and 10 fossil 0 13 co2 eq kwh 0 042 kg co2 eq mj to fully renewable 0 06 kg co2 eq kwh 0 042 kg co2 eq mj details are provided in table s1 in si since energy systems undergo dramatic changes in the quest to reduce climate change impacts in these years it is impossible to precisely define which exchanges between the sludge management system and the energy system are relevant but there is little doubt that energy systems are moving towards a higher degree of renewable sources as we use a consequential approach energy exchanges may differ from the average energy profile in society because marginal changes are considered this suggests that the assessment of sludge management climate change impacts and thus ranking of the tc alternatives must be made under these uncertainties ts and vs content scenarios both ts and vs content are expected to be critical for sludge treatment and alternative values are employed in scenario sensitivity analysis as shown in table 4 by changing only one parameter at a time these values bracket the ts and vs contents of thickened municipal sewage sludge in general see chang et al 2022a 3 results and discussion section 3 1 shows the process contribution of each tc for conventional sewage sludge treatment and disposal and section 3 2 shows the distribution and uncertainty of climate change impacts under different scenarios section 3 3 shows the global sensitivity of the key parameters and the best practice analysis of the configurations tc modelling is based on consistent mass balances for total mass wet weight vs ash c biogenic c fossil n p and k material and element flows keep track of ts water and carbon as illustrated in figs s3 and s4 in si their distributions to the outputs and emissions are crucial to the tcs climate change impacts 3 1 net climate change impacts of eight tcs under four different energy exchanges fig 3 illustrates the net climate change impacts of the eight tcs for sludge treatment and disposal considering four different energy exchanges based on the mean values of the model parameters average net climate change was in the wide range of 123 1607 kg co2 eq t ts for the 55 fossil energy exchange scenario in all scenarios tdr inc led to the lowest climate change impact when only considering the average net values the range does not change much as the energy exchange becomes less fossil based but loads and savings within each tc are three to four times higher with a 100 fossil energy exchange than with a fully renewable energy exchange loads from incineration and anaerobic digestion include contributions from energy consumption while energy recovery is shown separately the detailed process contribution of each technology with subdivisions is available in figure s5 in si the climate change impacts of the tcs with landfilling and composting tc1 and tc4 change less in line with energy exchange changes since both technologies have significant climate change issues unrelated to energy exchange landfilling has significant climate change loads from ch4 emission and climate change savings from sequestered carbon composting causes climate change due to fugitive ch4 emissions the results show that the tcs with high energy consumption and simultaneously high energy recovery such as incineration and thermal drying can achieve lower net climate change impacts when compared to technologies that exhibit high direct emissions of greenhouse gases furthermore the advantages of cleaner energy exchange amplify this disparity as different technologies exhibit varying sensitivities to energy exchange 3 2 distribution and uncertainty of climate change impacts under different scenarios fig 4 and fig 5 provide the net climate change impacts of the eight tcs on sludge treatment with the four different energy exchanges in addition three different ts 1 6 3 3 and 5 0 of wet weight and vs 42 68 and 82 of ts contents in relation to the raw sewage sludge are included with ts and vs parameters represented by distributions reflecting their uncertainty illustrated in a boxplot the climate change impact uncertainty is substantial when sludge treatment technologies exchange with a 100 fossil energy system but it decreases as the energy exchange becomes less fossil based net value and uncertainty are largest for the wet sludge 1 6 ts and smallest for the driest sludge 5 0 ts tc ranking based on the mean value is not affected by the initial ts content of raw sludge this indicates that the choice of sludge treatment technology in terms of climate change impacts is not sensitive to the initial solid content of the raw sludge while actual values do depend on the sludge s solid content as shown in fig 5 the net values of the climate change impacts decrease when vs increases except for those linked to tc1 and tc4 for tc1 with landfill the net value and uncertainty relating to 100 year impacts increase when vs increases because of higher landfill gas generation and methane emissions composting is influenced very little by vs content given that biogenic co2 emissions are considered neutral in terms of climate change in contrast the impacts of tcs with incineration and ad decrease when vs increases due to better energy recovery without fossil co2 emissions the 20 year impacts in relation to climate change with changes in ts and vs contents are shown in figs s6 and s7 in si the results indicate that from a short term perspective tcs with landfill composting and ad cause two to four fold increases in climate change impacts and uncertainty while those with incineration are not notably affected since the higher characterisation factor of methane considering only 20 years amplifies the impacts from methane emissions or losses from landfilling and biological technologies since the uncertainty distributions of the climate change results for many of the tcs overlap fig 4 and fig 5 mean values are of limited value when comparing the alternatives thus the outcome of a discernibility analysis is shown in table 5 for raw sludge with 3 3 ts and assuming energy exchange with a 55 fossil based energy system for each row table 5 shows the likelihood that this tc in terms of climate change impact is better than a tc presented in one of the columns bold font numbers indicate better and normal font indicates worse focusing on likelihoods over 70 only a few tcs stand out as being significantly different with respect to climate change landfilling tr1 is likely to be worse than the alternatives while thermal drying and incineration tr3 is always likely to be better than the alternatives tcs combining ad with incineration drying and incineration or composting and land use tc6 tc8 all tend to be less attractive than the other tcs tc2 tc5 from a climate change point of view the discernibility analysis demonstrates insensitivity to both the solid content of the raw sludge and the exchange with the energy system see section s3 5 in si for additional results on discernibility compared to lca studies that utilize specific datasets the probability results obtained in this study offer a more comprehensive understanding and comparison of tcs for sludge treatment this is achieved through the utilization of statistical distributions derived from consistent data for each parameter by employing such an approach a broader and more general perspective can be gained facilitating a meaningful assessment and comparison of tcs for sludge treatment 3 3 parameter global sensitivity analysis and optimization the climate change results for the eight tcs demonstrate significant uncertainty associated with technology parameters thus the climate change results for each tc can be reduced by optimizing such technology parameters table 6 shows the results of the global sensitivity analysis identifying the model parameters making the largest contribution to the overall uncertainty of the climate change results at 3 3 ts in the 55 fossil energy exchange scenario global sensitivity analysis results for the remaining scenarios are provided in table s39 and s40 in si parameter sensitivity depends on the technologies involved and the specific configurations the results help identify the nine most important parameters characterized by both high sensitivity and uncertainty furthermore we identified the result scores in the distribution with the lowest 20 of impact named best practice cases which allowed for identifying the parameter that could be optimized shown in figure s8 in si with the largest reduction in climate change impact shown in fig 6 the environmental impact of different sludge treatment technologies is mainly determined by specific parameters for tc1 landfilling the most sensitive parameters are the transfer coefficient of c to wastewater and the degradation constant of biogenic c in the landfill as they control the amount of ch4 generated and c stored in the landfill to achieve the best practice cases the transfer coefficient of c to wastewater must increase to 11 6 from 8 7 figure s8e in si and biogenic c must be sequestered with the degradation constant narrowed from 0 001 to 0 3 to 0 01 0 12 figure s8h in si the first parameter can be measured easily for a particular sludge and dewatering technology and the use of polymers may play a role in achieving this however the degradation constant k is difficult to estimate and can only be measured in a laboratory setting that attempts to simulate a real landfill environment for tc2 incineration and tc3 thermal drying with incineration the primary factor is the heat used to pre dry sludge and reducing heat consumption by 70 can lead to best practice impacts with optimized consumption reducing impacts from 171 902 to 577 145 kg co2 eq t ts in tc3 for tc6 tc8 with ad the main uncertainty contributions come from not only anaerobic digestion but also energy consumption in thermal drying for tc4 composting controlling ch4 emissions can reduce impacts to 268 46 kg co2 eq t ts tc5 anaerobic digestion is the most uncertain with biogas generation fugitive losses and electricity consumption contributing to 95 of uncertainty improving the transfer coefficient of biogenic c and controlling fugitive losses can achieve best practice impacts if the transfer coefficient of biogenic c to biogas and vs degradation ratio can be improved slightly to 59 9 of biogenic c fig s8a in si and methane fugitive losses can be controlled to 5 figure s8c in si climate change impacts could see a saving of 268 117 kg co2 eq t ts in the best practice case fig 6e in contrast optimizing energy consumption in ad is less important fig s8d in si these optimized results do not alter the ranking of the best performing technologies as determined by the discernibility analysis the tc with tdr inc still leads in terms of the lowest climate change impacts followed by ad lf however parameter optimization indicates the direction of further technological innovations and developments particularly optimized parameters in the best practice cases were obtained in the range of their respective distributions implying that they are achievable and have already been realized in specific studies nevertheless achieving minimum overall climate change impacts necessitates optimizing all the parameters within the tc it is crucial to acknowledge that climate change impact is just one among numerous environmental impact categories and technological choices must be carefully balanced with social and economic considerations 4 conclusions we quantified the potential climate change impacts of eight conventional technology configurations for managing municipal sewage sludge by considering four different energy exchanges and reflecting that energy systems will change dramatically in future years climate change impacts were quantified with an lca model employing uncertainty distributions for the 104 model parameters utilized in the technology process modelling to determine the technical flows and emissions from the technology configurations for sludge treatment and disposal all tcs revealed large climate change loads and savings when the energy exchange was with a fossil based energy system whereas loads and savings were approximately three times lower when utilizing a renewable energy system exceptions were technology configurations involving landfilling and composting where methane emissions contributed significantly to climate change net climate change on average was in the large range of 123 1607 kg co2 eq t ts with thermal drying and incineration tdr inc having the lowest climate change impacts uncertainty associated with the climate change results was highly significant more than 100 with fossil energy exchange and with low ts content of the sludge while it was lower when employing renewable energy the ranking of the tcs based on the mean value is not affected by the initial solid content of the raw sludge thereby indicating that the choice of sludge treatment technology is not sensitive to the initial solid content of the raw sludge although the actual climate change impact does depend on this factor large variations in parameter data led to great uncertainty in relation to climate change impacts and maybe also to other environmental aspects this clearly shows that quantifying climate change impacts should not depend on single values but be quantified as much as possible case specifically with careful consideration of the data distribution since the observed uncertainties were large a discernibility analysis was conducted only a few technological configurations stood out as being significantly different with respect to climate change thermal drying and incineration had the highest probability of providing better climate change performance than the alternatives technological configurations combining anaerobic digestion with incineration drying and incineration or composting and land use were all less attractive from a climate change point of view than the other technological configurations considered the considerable uncertainties observed herein call for better technical data to support the establishment of more narrowly defined statistical distributions for the key parameters controlling the climate change impacts of conventional sewage sludge management the most critical parameters in this regard and the uncertainty associated with it are few in number but our global sensitivity analysis identified nine as especially important as discussed in detail many of these parameters can be easily measured for the relevant sewage sludge and technology to improve specific estimations of climate change when all scenarios were optimized to the 20 best cases it was found that thermal drying with incineration outranked the other scenarios the results of this paper stress the importance of using statistical distributions for key parameters as well as considering energy exchanges because our energy systems undergo dramatic changes in the coming years declaration

performance of different treatment and disposal technologies and identify the determinants of environmentally optimal solutions conventional technologies for treating and disposing of ss include biological treatments such as anaerobic digestion and composting and thermal treatments such as incineration and landfill disposal kacprzak et al 2017 nevertheless the specific utilization of these technologies varies depending on the regions and countries as example in europe approximately 14 million tons of sludge on a dry basis were produced in 2020 havukainen et al 2022 among the eu 27 countries 28 of the sludge was landfilled primarily in eastern europe where poland and romania landfilled over 50 of their sludge conversely more than 20 countries in central and western europe employed anaerobic digestion composting and incineration notably 35 of the sludge in france was composted while 69 was incinerated in germany kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 chojnacka et al 2023 in china annually producing approximately 11 million tons of sludge on dry basis mohurd china 2021 approximately 15 applied to the land direct land application or post composting 20 incinerated and 65 landfilled dai 2020 ss treatment and disposal involves a sequence of technologies and operations such as anaerobic digestion followed by composting and land application or drying followed by incineration and landfilling of the ashes choices relating to these sequences hereinafter called technological configurations tcs depend on several issues such as the contamination level of the sludge economy technology availability land availability and environmental impacts with increasing international focus on limiting climate change impacts united nations 2015 all sectors of society must contribute including sewage sludge treatment and disposal facilities it was estimated that in 2019 chinese sludge treatment emitted 10 8 million tons of co2 eq into the atmosphere wei et al 2020 technological diversity and variations in tcs present challenges in selecting the best way to manage ss in this context the potential climate change impacts of different tcs is an important indicator for comparison life cycle assessment lca is a standardized method iso 14040 2006 used to systematically compare the potential environmental impacts of technologies and systems several studies have used lcas to assess the climate change impacts of sludge management technologies ding et al 2021 for instance reviewed 37 studies published in 2010 2020 on sludge management lca with a focus on nutrient and energy recovery but this study did not provide the findings regarding climate change more recent papers however have applied lcas in this context mayer et al 2021 found that in germany after anaerobic digestion digestate applied to the land performed better than incinerating digested sludge other high temperature treatment options were also less attractive than the direct use of digestate on land mainardis et al 2021 showed an italian case that thermal drying prior to land application increased climate change impact whereas the same treatment prior to incineration was the better alternative from a climate change perspective havukainen et al 2022 found that in finland for dewatered sludge incineration was better than composting however this study highlighted the significant uncertainty associated with the results morsink georgali et al 2022 found that anaerobic digestion was significantly better than composting emerging treatment technologies have also been addressed for example lozano et al 2022 and luo et al 2021 dealt with high temperature processes the large variations in what has been found to be optimal technologies illustrate that lca results strongly depend on the goal and scope of the study as well as the assumptions and system boundaries christensen et al 2020 recommendations in the current literature based on studies in which not all tcs for sewage sludge management and disposal were examined under the same conditions e g the energy system in which tcs operate thereby preventing direct comparisons between results and especially identifying the factors that determine environmentally optimal tc moreover we have not been able to identify any thorough assessments of climate change impacts of the most commonly used sludge technologies that pay systematic attention to the uncertainty associated with parameters used in modelling as well as the future changes in climate changes depending on the energy systems applied the first aspect namely model parameter uncertainty is often neglected probably due to lack of data on the statistical distributions of key parameters however according to recent data reviews chang et al 2022a 2022b 2023a chang et al 2023b inventory data vary so much that lca modelling using single value parameters can be potentially misleading and the results offer inaccurate conclusions in preparing to choose a sludge technology accurate data on technology performance are rarely available and lca modelling often uses general data from literature but does not consider the uncertainty associated with them the second aspect i e energy used or recovered in sludge treatment has been shown in several studies to affect climate change impacts zhao et al 2022 but no studies consider the fact that the energy systems with which sludge management technologies interact will change dramatically in the future as renewable energy sources are introduced many countries have political ambitions of being fossil free by 2050 and investments made in sludge technologies today are likely to last beyond 2050 and thus will see a dramatic change in energy systems this implies that the climate change loads and savings which pertain to the impacts resulting from and avoided by the management of energy exchanges in sewage sludge will differ in the future the term energy exchanges will be used to discuss these implications the objective of this paper is to provide a consistent and transparent assessment of the potential climate change impacts of conventional tcs for managing municipal sewage sludge using the lca methodology the consistency of the assessment entails evaluating a range of tcs based on the same conditions and assumptions for lca modelling and paying proper attention to model parameter uncertainty and different energy exchanges the study aims to quantify the ambiguity around climate change impacts caused by both model input values and modelling choices we used statistically significant data published in the literature on sludge composition dewatering anaerobic digestion composting incineration landfilling and the land application of sewage sludge the expected outcomes include the quantitative climate change impacts of different sludge treatment technologies in view of changing energy systems additionally we identify the critical sensitive technological parameters for which accurate information is crucial and potential optimization is promising for further technological development the latter approach may inspire and assist in the further development of relevant technologies and can be used to target key data for case specific studies 2 materials and methods this section provides data for a systematic comparison of conventional management options for sewage sludge starting with a common composition of the sludge material it is carried out as an lca and an analysis of result robustness in particular the study used input distribution values in the model derived from thorough literature reviews chang et al 2022a 2022b 2023a 2023b in order to assess the sensitivity and uncertainty of the model results 2 1 sewage sludge composition treated municipal sewage sludge is thickened and has an average composition derived from the review by chang et al 2022a referring to 162 studies the characteristics are 3 3 ts 68 vs of ts 32 ash of ts 53 c of vs 7 n of vs 7 p of ash 2 k of ash and 22 mj kg dry vs as the lower heating value lhv a detailed composition is presented in supporting information si in tracking substances through the sludge treatment system we assume that n is linked to vs while p and k are linked to ash according to their existing forms chang et al 2022a huang et al 2017 kulikowska and gusiatin 2015 according to chang et al 2022a the 53 c in the vs is typically 45 biogenic c and 8 fossil c the latter of which is considered non degradable but fully combustible 2 2 technological configurations tc we consider eight different tcs tcs 1 8 all of which are conventional well established and used in full scale applications the technologies included dewatering drying composting anaerobic digestion incineration landfilling land use after composting only ash landfilling after incineration only and wastewater treatment after dewatering and drying the tcs are listed in table 1 showing the included technologies and main deliveries the main flows are shown in fig 1 2 3 technology description the conventional sludge treatment technologies considered are described in si in terms of inventory data which in terms of data distribution are mainly based on large amounts of parameter statistics compiled in our previous studies brief descriptions of the core technologies and key data relevant to mass flows and climate change impact quantification are provided below 2 3 1 anaerobic digestion ad sewage sludge digestion is a process that occurs under anaerobic conditions at elevated temperatures and involving prolonged mixing according to chang et al 2023a approximately 48 12 of biogenic carbon undergoes conversion into biogas during digestion resulting in the production of 248 76 m3 methane ch4 per t vs with 64 5 ch4 content the losses of biogas from the digester are estimated to be an average of 7 5 following a lognormal distribution of ld 1 8 0 7 as reported by scheutz and fredenslund 2019 around 38 7 of the biogas is converted to electricity while 41 3 16 5 is utilized for heat based on the lhv of biogas this results in the production of 9763 324 kwh of electricity and 3779 1868 mj of heat per ton vs the overall energy consumption for this process is estimated to be 111 61 mj per t wet weight input according to chang et al 2023a with electricity accounting for 59 heat for 29 and diesel for 12 as per yoshida et al 2015 additionally the loss of vs is approximately 2 7 kg per kg of biogenic carbon loss following a lognormal distribution of ld 0 84 0 56 which corresponds to a degradation of 46 11 of vs finally the resulting digestate which constitutes 29 9 0 3 kg t ts undergoes dewatering 2 3 2 dewatering dw mechanical dewatering typically performed using centrifuges or filter presses is commonly augmented by the addition of coagulating or flocculating polymer chang et al 2023b the consumption of flocculating polymer for both raw and digested sludge follows a normal distribution with average values of 7 0 4 2 kg t ts input and 10 6 4 6 kg t ts input respectively likewise electricity consumption also adheres to a normal distribution with average values of 1 7 0 2 kwh t wet weight input for raw sludge and 7 3 1 2 kwh t wet weight input for digested sludge the extracted water is subsequently treated in a wastewater treatment plant using the activated sludge method as described in supporting information si section s1 7 2 3 3 thermal drying tdr thermal drying tdr is modelled as a belt dryer utilizing heat to raise the drying temperature above 100 c heat recovery achieved through a heat exchanger captures approximately 65 80 of vapor energy during the drying process approximately 7 6 5 3 of the vs content is lost assuming that the transfer coefficient of c to the exhaust air is equivalent to that of vs the c is released as co2 into the air energy consumption is estimated to be 2 2 1 0 mj per kg wet weight with heat accounting for 82 and electricity for 18 as reported by chang et al 2023b 2 3 4 incineration inc incineration is modelled as a fluidized bed reactor with air pollution controls and for electricity and heat recovery the resulting bottom and fly ash from the process are disposed into landfills the lhv is estimated to be 2 9 1 2 mj kg wet weight for dewatered raw sludge and 11 5 2 7 mj kg wet weight for dried raw sludge the electricity and heat uses are 0 42 0 37 kwh kg ts and 7 8 5 8 mj kg ts for dewatered sludge and 0 36 0 37 kwh kg ts and 0 9 1 2 mj kg ts for dried sludge based on data compiled by chang et al 2022b furthermore the same data indicates that the electricity recovery is approximately 10 8 4 5 and heat recovery is 49 8 12 1 of the lhv 2 3 5 composting cp composting is modelled as turned windrows with air input and the resulting compost is utilized on land as described in si in this modelling approach no off gas control system is taken into account and the use and fate of bulking agents are omitted to maintain consistency within the system during composting vs undergo degradation with a degradation rate of 55 2 22 7 for dewatered raw sludge and 43 4 23 5 for dewatered digested sludge as compiled by chang et al 2023a methane is emitted from the windrows at a rate of 0 0081 0 0077 kg kg ts diesel is consumed for turning the windrows with a rate of 0 0069 0 0078 kg kg ts additionally electricity usage amounts to 0 11 0 07 kwh kg ts for air input and mechanical equipment the reported data originate from one full scale plant as reported by chang et al 2023a 2 3 6 landfill lf landfilling is modelled as a typical modern landfill that incorporates landfill gas and leachate controls sewage sludge is assumed to be landfilled and mixed with municipal solid waste the study considers operations and emissions for 100 years after landfilling manfredi and christensen 2009 the landfill modelling incorporates gas generation which is based on volatile solids vs in the sewage sludge and utilizes a first order degradation constant k 0 3194 year 1 following the approach outlined by zhu and zhao s 2011 any biogenic carbon that remains unemitted within 100 year period is sequestered and considered a climate change saving gas is collected for 55 years with varying efficiency levels for the first three years it s the collection efficiency is 45 followed by 70 efficiency for the subsequent 12 years the remaining 40 years of gas collection exhibit an efficiency of 85 as a result approximately 39 of the generated gas is emitted james and morton 2017 wang et al 2020 and no methane oxidation occurs in the top cover zhao et al 2022 of the collected gas 87 is utilized for electricity production with an efficiency of 37 of the gas lhv additionally 9 of the collected gas is flared and 4 is vented zhao et al 2022 the study also accounts for fuel consumption related to landfill operation of 0 3 kg t wet weight zhao et al 2022 and leachate treatment which uses 24 kwh t leachate for 100 years details in si 2 4 life cycle assessment lca lca is used to quantify the climate change impacts of the eight tcs the principles used are in accordance with the iso14040 standard iso 2006 and ilcd guidelines ilcd 2010 recommendations the functional unit is the treatment and disposal of one ton 1000 kg of the ts content of thickened municipal sewage sludge set at 3 3 ts water content 96 7 and corresponding to a sludge wet weight of 30 300 kg chang et al 2022a in some of the sensitivity analyses we change the ts content and thus accordingly change the wet mass of the actual ts the time scope for the study is 2025 2050 while the time horizon for emission accounting as well as for climate change characterization factors for 100 years and 20 years in addition to the technologies described in the tcs the system boundary also includes transporting thickened sludge see si for each technology energy and material consumption as well as energy and nutrient recovery is included we apply system expansion following key lca principles by subtracting the alternative products that are avoided when energy and nutrients are recovered within the system impacts related to facility construction are excluded tc process modelling and climate change impact quantification were carried out with easetech model v3 4 4 clavreul et al 2014 while the ecoinvent database substitution consequential long term version 3 8 was used for background data on material and energy consumption and substitution the study uses consequential lca principles and the specific datasets used are found in si global warming potentials are quantified for greenhouse gases for the 20 year and 100 year time horizons provided in the sixth assessment report of intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2021 table 2 lists the characterization factors considered in this study christensen et al 2009 2 5 interpretation of the lca results 2 5 1 uncertainty analysis and parameter sensitivity analysis lca model input values result uncertainty in relation to the model input values was quantified with uncertainty propagation the model s input values were represented with probability distributions and these parameters were utilized in a monte carlo simulation facilitated by easetech which included 10 000 samples from the parameter distributions thus yielding 10 000 lcia result scores clavreul et al 2012 the samples were taken dependently i e the sampled values were the same for each run of parameters shared between tcs distributions obtained from the monte carlo simulation reflect the uncertainty of the lca results the distributions were further analyzed for expected value and interquartile ranges as well as for a pair wise comparison of the assessed tcs through discernibility analysis heijungs and kleijn 2001 in order to calculate pair wise probability measures of one tc performing better than another global sensitivity analysis was used to analyze the fundamental connections between result sensitivity and the uncertainty of individual model parameters and to calculate the contribution of each parameter to the lca results uncertainty bisinella et al 2016 details in section s2 of si from the monte carlo simulations best practice cases with the top 20 cumulative probability excluding 5 extreme data in terms of climate change were identified to represent potential targets for improving each tc s technologies 2 5 2 parameter distributions the model is based on 104 technological parameters each represented by a distribution see table s3 in si for details distributions associated with the parameters show significant variations and skewness thereby illustrating the limitations of representing such parameters with a single value nine parameters identified in table 3 were very sensitive in general based on the later robustness assessment and their distributions are presented in fig 2 2 5 3 scenario sensitivity analysis scenario variation describes how the results of a scenario vary subject to changes in boundary conditions or imports exports over the boundary we considered different energy exchanges as well as the ts and vs content of the sludge we also evaluated both 20 year and 100 year climate change characterization factors energy exchange scenarios all tcs use energy but some also recover it we account for the use and recovery of energy separately although some plants may use the produced energy internally however since we assign the same climate change impact to the use and recovery of energy the net result is not affected we consider four different energy electricity kwh and heat mj exchanges ranging from 100 fossil 0 984 kg co2 eq kwh 0 111 kg co2 eq mj over two transient exchanges of 55 fossil 0 56 kg co2 eq kwh 0 111 kg co2 eq mj and 10 fossil 0 13 co2 eq kwh 0 042 kg co2 eq mj to fully renewable 0 06 kg co2 eq kwh 0 042 kg co2 eq mj details are provided in table s1 in si since energy systems undergo dramatic changes in the quest to reduce climate change impacts in these years it is impossible to precisely define which exchanges between the sludge management system and the energy system are relevant but there is little doubt that energy systems are moving towards a higher degree of renewable sources as we use a consequential approach energy exchanges may differ from the average energy profile in society because marginal changes are considered this suggests that the assessment of sludge management climate change impacts and thus ranking of the tc alternatives must be made under these uncertainties ts and vs content scenarios both ts and vs content are expected to be critical for sludge treatment and alternative values are employed in scenario sensitivity analysis as shown in table 4 by changing only one parameter at a time these values bracket the ts and vs contents of thickened municipal sewage sludge in general see chang et al 2022a 3 results and discussion section 3 1 shows the process contribution of each tc for conventional sewage sludge treatment and disposal and section 3 2 shows the distribution and uncertainty of climate change impacts under different scenarios section 3 3 shows the global sensitivity of the key parameters and the best practice analysis of the configurations tc modelling is based on consistent mass balances for total mass wet weight vs ash c biogenic c fossil n p and k material and element flows keep track of ts water and carbon as illustrated in figs s3 and s4 in si their distributions to the outputs and emissions are crucial to the tcs climate change impacts 3 1 net climate change impacts of eight tcs under four different energy exchanges fig 3 illustrates the net climate change impacts of the eight tcs for sludge treatment and disposal considering four different energy exchanges based on the mean values of the model parameters average net climate change was in the wide range of 123 1607 kg co2 eq t ts for the 55 fossil energy exchange scenario in all scenarios tdr inc led to the lowest climate change impact when only considering the average net values the range does not change much as the energy exchange becomes less fossil based but loads and savings within each tc are three to four times higher with a 100 fossil energy exchange than with a fully renewable energy exchange loads from incineration and anaerobic digestion include contributions from energy consumption while energy recovery is shown separately the detailed process contribution of each technology with subdivisions is available in figure s5 in si the climate change impacts of the tcs with landfilling and composting tc1 and tc4 change less in line with energy exchange changes since both technologies have significant climate change issues unrelated to energy exchange landfilling has significant climate change loads from ch4 emission and climate change savings from sequestered carbon composting causes climate change due to fugitive ch4 emissions the results show that the tcs with high energy consumption and simultaneously high energy recovery such as incineration and thermal drying can achieve lower net climate change impacts when compared to technologies that exhibit high direct emissions of greenhouse gases furthermore the advantages of cleaner energy exchange amplify this disparity as different technologies exhibit varying sensitivities to energy exchange 3 2 distribution and uncertainty of climate change impacts under different scenarios fig 4 and fig 5 provide the net climate change impacts of the eight tcs on sludge treatment with the four different energy exchanges in addition three different ts 1 6 3 3 and 5 0 of wet weight and vs 42 68 and 82 of ts contents in relation to the raw sewage sludge are included with ts and vs parameters represented by distributions reflecting their uncertainty illustrated in a boxplot the climate change impact uncertainty is substantial when sludge treatment technologies exchange with a 100 fossil energy system but it decreases as the energy exchange becomes less fossil based net value and uncertainty are largest for the wet sludge 1 6 ts and smallest for the driest sludge 5 0 ts tc ranking based on the mean value is not affected by the initial ts content of raw sludge this indicates that the choice of sludge treatment technology in terms of climate change impacts is not sensitive to the initial solid content of the raw sludge while actual values do depend on the sludge s solid content as shown in fig 5 the net values of the climate change impacts decrease when vs increases except for those linked to tc1 and tc4 for tc1 with landfill the net value and uncertainty relating to 100 year impacts increase when vs increases because of higher landfill gas generation and methane emissions composting is influenced very little by vs content given that biogenic co2 emissions are considered neutral in terms of climate change in contrast the impacts of tcs with incineration and ad decrease when vs increases due to better energy recovery without fossil co2 emissions the 20 year impacts in relation to climate change with changes in ts and vs contents are shown in figs s6 and s7 in si the results indicate that from a short term perspective tcs with landfill composting and ad cause two to four fold increases in climate change impacts and uncertainty while those with incineration are not notably affected since the higher characterisation factor of methane considering only 20 years amplifies the impacts from methane emissions or losses from landfilling and biological technologies since the uncertainty distributions of the climate change results for many of the tcs overlap fig 4 and fig 5 mean values are of limited value when comparing the alternatives thus the outcome of a discernibility analysis is shown in table 5 for raw sludge with 3 3 ts and assuming energy exchange with a 55 fossil based energy system for each row table 5 shows the likelihood that this tc in terms of climate change impact is better than a tc presented in one of the columns bold font numbers indicate better and normal font indicates worse focusing on likelihoods over 70 only a few tcs stand out as being significantly different with respect to climate change landfilling tr1 is likely to be worse than the alternatives while thermal drying and incineration tr3 is always likely to be better than the alternatives tcs combining ad with incineration drying and incineration or composting and land use tc6 tc8 all tend to be less attractive than the other tcs tc2 tc5 from a climate change point of view the discernibility analysis demonstrates insensitivity to both the solid content of the raw sludge and the exchange with the energy system see section s3 5 in si for additional results on discernibility compared to lca studies that utilize specific datasets the probability results obtained in this study offer a more comprehensive understanding and comparison of tcs for sludge treatment this is achieved through the utilization of statistical distributions derived from consistent data for each parameter by employing such an approach a broader and more general perspective can be gained facilitating a meaningful assessment and comparison of tcs for sludge treatment 3 3 parameter global sensitivity analysis and optimization the climate change results for the eight tcs demonstrate significant uncertainty associated with technology parameters thus the climate change results for each tc can be reduced by optimizing such technology parameters table 6 shows the results of the global sensitivity analysis identifying the model parameters making the largest contribution to the overall uncertainty of the climate change results at 3 3 ts in the 55 fossil energy exchange scenario global sensitivity analysis results for the remaining scenarios are provided in table s39 and s40 in si parameter sensitivity depends on the technologies involved and the specific configurations the results help identify the nine most important parameters characterized by both high sensitivity and uncertainty furthermore we identified the result scores in the distribution with the lowest 20 of impact named best practice cases which allowed for identifying the parameter that could be optimized shown in figure s8 in si with the largest reduction in climate change impact shown in fig 6 the environmental impact of different sludge treatment technologies is mainly determined by specific parameters for tc1 landfilling the most sensitive parameters are the transfer coefficient of c to wastewater and the degradation constant of biogenic c in the landfill as they control the amount of ch4 generated and c stored in the landfill to achieve the best practice cases the transfer coefficient of c to wastewater must increase to 11 6 from 8 7 figure s8e in si and biogenic c must be sequestered with the degradation constant narrowed from 0 001 to 0 3 to 0 01 0 12 figure s8h in si the first parameter can be measured easily for a particular sludge and dewatering technology and the use of polymers may play a role in achieving this however the degradation constant k is difficult to estimate and can only be measured in a laboratory setting that attempts to simulate a real landfill environment for tc2 incineration and tc3 thermal drying with incineration the primary factor is the heat used to pre dry sludge and reducing heat consumption by 70 can lead to best practice impacts with optimized consumption reducing impacts from 171 902 to 577 145 kg co2 eq t ts in tc3 for tc6 tc8 with ad the main uncertainty contributions come from not only anaerobic digestion but also energy consumption in thermal drying for tc4 composting controlling ch4 emissions can reduce impacts to 268 46 kg co2 eq t ts tc5 anaerobic digestion is the most uncertain with biogas generation fugitive losses and electricity consumption contributing to 95 of uncertainty improving the transfer coefficient of biogenic c and controlling fugitive losses can achieve best practice impacts if the transfer coefficient of biogenic c to biogas and vs degradation ratio can be improved slightly to 59 9 of biogenic c fig s8a in si and methane fugitive losses can be controlled to 5 figure s8c in si climate change impacts could see a saving of 268 117 kg co2 eq t ts in the best practice case fig 6e in contrast optimizing energy consumption in ad is less important fig s8d in si these optimized results do not alter the ranking of the best performing technologies as determined by the discernibility analysis the tc with tdr inc still leads in terms of the lowest climate change impacts followed by ad lf however parameter optimization indicates the direction of further technological innovations and developments particularly optimized parameters in the best practice cases were obtained in the range of their respective distributions implying that they are achievable and have already been realized in specific studies nevertheless achieving minimum overall climate change impacts necessitates optimizing all the parameters within the tc it is crucial to acknowledge that climate change impact is just one among numerous environmental impact categories and technological choices must be carefully balanced with social and economic considerations 4 conclusions we quantified the potential climate change impacts of eight conventional technology configurations for managing municipal sewage sludge by considering four different energy exchanges and reflecting that energy systems will change dramatically in future years climate change impacts were quantified with an lca model employing uncertainty distributions for the 104 model parameters utilized in the technology process modelling to determine the technical flows and emissions from the technology configurations for sludge treatment and disposal all tcs revealed large climate change loads and savings when the energy exchange was with a fossil based energy system whereas loads and savings were approximately three times lower when utilizing a renewable energy system exceptions were technology configurations involving landfilling and composting where methane emissions contributed significantly to climate change net climate change on average was in the large range of 123 1607 kg co2 eq t ts with thermal drying and incineration tdr inc having the lowest climate change impacts uncertainty associated with the climate change results was highly significant more than 100 with fossil energy exchange and with low ts content of the sludge while it was lower when employing renewable energy the ranking of the tcs based on the mean value is not affected by the initial solid content of the raw sludge thereby indicating that the choice of sludge treatment technology is not sensitive to the initial solid content of the raw sludge although the actual climate change impact does depend on this factor large variations in parameter data led to great uncertainty in relation to climate change impacts and maybe also to other environmental aspects this clearly shows that quantifying climate change impacts should not depend on single values but be quantified as much as possible case specifically with careful consideration of the data distribution since the observed uncertainties were large a discernibility analysis was conducted only a few technological configurations stood out as being significantly different with respect to climate change thermal drying and incineration had the highest probability of providing better climate change performance than the alternatives technological configurations combining anaerobic digestion with incineration drying and incineration or composting and land use were all less attractive from a climate change point of view than the other technological configurations considered the considerable uncertainties observed herein call for better technical data to support the establishment of more narrowly defined statistical distributions for the key parameters controlling the climate change impacts of conventional sewage sludge management the most critical parameters in this regard and the uncertainty associated with it are few in number but our global sensitivity analysis identified nine as especially important as discussed in detail many of these parameters can be easily measured for the relevant sewage sludge and technology to improve specific estimations of climate change when all scenarios were optimized to the 20 best cases it was found that thermal drying with incineration outranked the other scenarios the results of this paper stress the importance of using statistical distributions for key parameters as well as considering energy exchanges because our energy systems undergo dramatic changes in the coming years declaration
