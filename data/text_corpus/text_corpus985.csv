4925,phosphorus p is an important biogenic element that limits algal growth and influences primary productivity and biogeochemical cycling of other biogenic elements in freshwater and marine ecosystems surface water samples were collected along the salinity gradients from the western and eastern flanks of the maowei sea mws during july 2018 for measurements of different p species including dissolved nitrogen and silicate total dissolved p tdp dominated the total p tp accounting for 64 9 9 7 of tp possibly due to relatively less suspended particulate matter 100 mg l among the dissolved p species dissolved organic p dop was more abundant dop tdp 58 1 20 than dissolved inorganic p dip considering the entire dataset the average dip concentration 1 53 0 83 μm was lower to medium range while dop was relatively higher compared to other estuaries and coastal waters bodies worldwide particulate p was mainly present as particulate inorganic p pip which accounted for 68 5 9 0 of the total particulate p tpp the behavior of different p species along the salinity gradients indicated that their concentrations were dominantly influenced by riverine inputs and biogeochemical processes intensive mariculture activities in the mws may have also contributed to elevated dop compared to other coastal marine systems worldwide apart from similar sources of input and cycling processes the stoichiometric relationship between dip dissolved inorganic n din and dissolved silicate dsi suggested that p is potentially limiting while si may co limit primary productivity the latitudinal distribution of different p species indicated that strong transformations existed between the particulate and dissolved p phases along the salinity gradients the negative relationship between p partitioning coefficient log kd and salinity and with suspended particulate matter log spm suggested that strong particle reactivity and probable competition between dissolved p with other anions for adsorption sites influenced the partitioning of p species in surface water additionally the end member binary model showed that 1 24 1 55 μm of dip may have been removed through biological uptake in summary this study shows that the dynamic changes in the concentrations spatial distribution and transformation process of different p species between dissolved and particulate phases can effectively reveal the sources of p and understand the internal relationship between the biogeochemical cycling of p stoichiometric status and eutrophication keywords phosphorus chemical speciation biogeochemical processes maowei sea 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential bio limiting macronutrient in the biosphere and play crucial roles in regulating ecosystem function and primary productivity in freshwater and coastal marine systems björkman and karl 2003 slomp et al 2004 yang et al 2018a the lower concentration of p in many aquatic environments is partly due to the solubility of apatite being the commonest naturally occurring mineral containing p in the earth s crust in freshwater which is generally 0 4 wt ayers and watson 1991 and thus the dissolved p levels in pristine or less contaminated environments are generally 0 5 μm other biogenic elements such as nitrogen n and silica si are also essential for the ecological sustainability of an aquatic ecosystem therefore the contents and distributions of n and si in dissolved phase and their stoichiometric relationships with p may generally influence nutrient structures and behavior with important ecological implications on primary productivity and phytoplankton species composition duan et al 2016 dan et al 2019 in the last three decades anthropogenic perturbations in coastal areas have increased the concentration of dissolved inorganic p dip up to 2 3 fold in some larger rivers worldwide wang et al 2018 cozzi et al 2019 comparatively dip concentrations in small medium river systems and bays have become elevated exceeding 10 μm than in the world s large rivers van der zee et al 2007 eliani russak et al 2013 due to industrial and agricultural activities around small river basins that lack stringent regulations of local government and especially in bays that have weak capacity of self purification pan et al 2020 the loading of p beyond pristine levels mostly results in eutrophication and bottom water hypoxia due to an abnormal algal production in estuarine and coastal marine environments lin et al 2018 total p tp has been reported as an insufficient measure to evaluate p speciation and predict its potential bioavailability in coastal waters e g dan et al 2020a 2020b however studies on different forms of p i e inorganic or organic with their different chemical reactivity and speciation have been proposed to understand the biogeochemical behavior and bioavailability of p not only in sediments but also in the water column thus knowledge of the abundance speciation distributions and transformation of p is essential for a better understanding of p behavior and ecosystem quality in coastal marine environments benitez nelson 2000 lin et al 2016 yang et al 2016 in natural waters tp is mainly partitioned into dissolved inorganic p dip dissolved organic p dop particulate inorganic p pip and particulate organic p pop phases van der zee et al 2007 lin et al 2012 karl 2014 lin and guo 2016 the pip and pop together constitutes the total particulate p tpp pool while dop and dip together constitutes the total dissolved p tdp pool aquatic living creatures or detrital organic matter are the major components of pop while pip occurs in mineral phases with complex components duan et al 2016 li et al 2017 which includes the adsorbed p and co precipitated p with calcium and or fe oxyhydr oxides house 2003 vilmin et al 2015 generally dip consists of orthophosphate po4 3 pyrophosphate pyrop and polyphosphate polyp of which po4 3 being the most dominant with high reactivity among others is preferentially utilized by phytoplankton while some phytoplankton cannot directly assimilate pyrop and polyp duan et al 2016 diaz et al 2016 similar to dip recent studies have revealed that phytoplankton or microbial community can also assimilate low molecular weight dop under special aquatic environmental conditions when dip is not enough to provide the nutritional needs of living aquatic organisms yoshimura et al 2014 li et al 2017 therefore information about dop is also of scientific significance since the extant microorganism community may assimilate dip and dop simultaneously especially if dop is more abundant and bioavailable relative to dip in natural waters björkman and karl 2003 several factors can influence concentration and distribution of dip and dop in coastal waters for example the absorbed dip and dop on suspended particulate matter spm which is massively transported by rivers and can be desorbed in estuaries and coastal waters due to increasing salinity paytan and mclaughlin 2007 jordan et al 2008 yang et al 2018a studies show that 87 of the particle bound p in the oceans is delivered through global riverine supply e g jensen et al 2006 because p is highly reactive to water borne particulate matter the tpp often accounts for a larger proportion of tp than tdp especially in turbid spm 100 mg l riverine and nearshore waters nevertheless tpp may be an important contributor of dissolved p through desorption processes even in less turbid aquatic environments due to dynamic changes in some physiochemical conditions and the regeneration or removal of dip might be related to p partitioning coefficient kd between dissolved and particulate phases prastka et al 1998 jordan et al 2008 in summary particulate p phase can serve as a potential source of dip and or dop for phytoplankton and microbial community growth and metabolism thus knowledge on dissolved and particulate p pool is important to evaluate the transformation potential of p and its bioavailability in estuarine and coastal marine environments maowei sea mws is a typical subtropical bay influenced mostly by the discharge of the maolingjiang river and qinjiang river and tidal influx from the beibu gulf through qinzhou bay and constitutes a unique estuary bay multi ecosystem with rich aquatic resources and conducive environment for oyster mariculture wei et al 2017 however frequent harmful algal blooms have been occurring recently in the mws due to the rapidly growing industrialization urbanization and intense mariculture activities in the watershed gu et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 previous studies in the mws have focused on sedimentary p yang et al 2019a 2019b dan et al 2020a reports show that inorganic p mainly in the form of fe bound p is generally the predominant form of sedimentary p in the mws and sedimentary p is dominantly derived from terrestrial sources moreover sediment textural characteristics distributions of organic matter hydrodynamics in addition to external input from agriculture drainage areas and aquaculture activities together play significant roles for the variation tendencies of different fractions of p in sediments yang et al 2019a 2019b dan et al 2020a the potential bioavailable p i e the labile p forms has been reported to account for more than 70 of the sedimentary tp in the mws yang et al 2019b on the other hand a comprehensive study focusing on p speciation in the water column of danshuei river estuary in northern taiwan showed that dip is strongly influenced by desorption from and adsorption onto pip of which pip accounted for 60 of tp in regions where salinity was 5 psu but decreased to 40 50 in the lower estuary where salinity exceeded 30 psu fang and wang 2020 generally the spatiotemporal variability in physicochemical factors including ph salinity water temperature spm in surface water of many coastal marine systems play different roles on p speciation distribution and bioavailability in the water column prastka and malcolm 1994 zhou et al 2016 shinohara et al 2018 however detailed information on the biogeochemistry of p and the transformation behavior between different p species and phases and their relationships with the spatial distribution of physicochemical parameters and related dissolved nutrients in surface water of the mws is lacking thus a systematic study into better understanding the biogeochemical behavior of all species of p in the mws is required given the importance of the mws and its environmental function for mariculture and fishery resources thus this study was conducted on surface water samples collected along the salinity gradients at the western and eastern flanks of the mws which are influenced by the major adjoining river and tributaries the objectives were as follows 1 quantify the abundance of different p species in dissolved and particulate phases in the mws 2 evaluate the dissolved p status in the mws and identify the limiting nutrients for primary production based on nutrients molar ratios 3 evaluate the relationship between different p species and physiochemical parameters such as salinity spm and chl a 4 explore the biogeochemical changes and partitioning of p between dissolved and particulate phases 5 apply a two end member mixing model to elucidate the influence of freshwater discharge on p removal addition 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the mws is a semi enclosed bay in the northern beibu gulf situated at the northwestern part of south china sea wang et al 2017 dan et al 2020a fig 1 a the surface area of the mws is approximately 135 km2 and the water depth is relatively shallow average 2 5 m liu et al 2016 gu et al 2018 the regional climate is controlled by the tropical maritime monsoon with annual air temperature ranging from 0 8 c to 37 4 c with an average of 22 1 c the mean annual rainfall is 2140 mm of which 80 85 falls during the rainy season from may to september meng et al 2016 chen et al 2018 the annual freshwater discharge from the maolingjiang river and qinjiang river the two largest rivers in the mws situated at the western and eastern flanks respectively is 25 9 108 m3 y 1 and 20 3 108 m3 y 1 respectively the main stream length of dalanjiang river is 21 33 km and its catchment area is only 62 3 km2 with a low freshwater discharge about 8 6 104 tons y 1 of suspended sediment is co delivered from these rivers into the mws chen et al 2018 irregular diurnal tides average tidal range 2 5 m exist along the coast with a maximum tidal elevation of 5 5 m tian et al 2014 chen et al 2018 the surface water circulation in the mws is anticyclonic and the water current from qinzhou bay enters and exit from the eastern and western coastal areas respectively xu et al 2020 the baggy geomorphology of mws together with the narrow outlet channel linking it with the qinzhou bay somewhat limits rapid water exchange between these two water bodies and beibu gulf zhang et al 2019 this condition makes the mws behaves like a typical subtropical estuary especially during the summer rainy season with surface salinity being generally 20 psu urban settlements dominate land use in the mws watershed and most of the northern regions are dominated by shrimp ponds the eastern catchment regions are also dominated by shrimp ponds including agricultural activities and mangrove forest while factories and agricultural farms are clustered around the western regions the natural mangrove reserve wetlands occupy an area of 2784 hm2 along the coastline of the mws the human population within 1 15 km of the region where the mws is located as of 2016 was 0 45 million inhabitants which represents 10 of the total qinzhou population in the guangxi province in china the mws is the largest natural oyster seedling and mariculture bay in china and the mangrove nature reserve is the most extensive in qinzhou bay the sea represents a significant economic developing region which has been gradually impacted by anthropogenic activities gu et al 2018 2 2 sampling field survey was carried out in july 2018 fifteen representative sampling stations were selected longitudinally along the salinity gradients starting from the northern and ending at the southern regions where the mws connects with the qinzhou bay fig 1b the sampling stations consisted of nine sites 1 9 at the western flank of the sea and six sites 10 15 at the eastern flank fig 1b the rational for selecting these sites was to capture the influence of the adjoining rivers such as the maolingjiang river and or the dalanjiang river at the western flank of the sea and qinjiang river at the eastern flank on biogeochemical behavior transformation and speciation of p in the mws considering that physicochemical factors such as salinity are greatly affected by tidal fluctuations the sampling was conducted simultaneously during the same tide time at the western and eastern flanks at each site surface water samples 1 m below surface were collected using niskin bottle water sampler volume 5 l and stored in pre acid cleaned 2 l hdpe plastic bottles in order to limit the possible changes in p species in the samples over time the collected samples were immediately stored in cooling container temperature 4 c in the field sampling physical parameters such as surface water salinity s temperature t ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured in situ using a pre calibrated multi parameter water quality probe ap 5000 aquaread co uk while the oxidation reduction potential eh was also measured in situ using a portable redox potentiometer thermofisher 4 star usa in the laboratory 300 ml of the water samples were filtered through pre combusted 0 45 µm nuclepore filters whatman 47 mm for the measurement of dissolved nitrite no2 nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 total dissolved n tdn dissolved silicate dsi tdp and dip the suspended solids retained on the filters were used for the measurement of spm tpp and pip concentrations additionally aliquot of 500 ml water samples was also filtered through pre combusted 0 7 μm gf f filters under low vacuum for chlorophyll a chl a analyses all sampling pretreatment were completed within 5 h the filtrates and filters were immediately preserved at 20 c in the laboratory until further analyses which were subsequently done within one month 2 3 laboratory analyses concentrations of no2 were measured by reacting no2 with aromatic amine while no3 and nh4 determinations were based on copper cadmium cu cd column reduction and indophenol blue color formation methods respectively the sum of no2 no3 and nh4 is hereafter reported as dissolved inorganic n din dsi was measured using a reducing reagent molybdate and oxalic acid the reaction products were quantified using the modified spectrophotometric methods of hansen and koroleff 1999 concentrations of no2 no3 nh4 and dsi were determined in the laboratory using an auto analyzer aa3 hr seal analytical ltd uk tdn was decomposed to no3 with boric acid persulfate oxidation solution k2s2o8 and h3bo3 in naoh solution this was done in an autoclave at 120 c for 0 5 h and then measured using an auto analyzer liu et al 2005 lin et al 2012 concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen don was calculated as the difference between tdn and din i e don tdn din the analytical precision was 5 for nutrients mentioned above yang et al 2018a the determination of tdp was based on an autoclave assisted acid persulfate method with modification according to lin et al 2012 in brief 10 ml of the filtered water sample and 1 ml of acidified k2s2o8 solution 50 g l ph 1 were added to a plug colorimetric tube and the mixed solution was digested at 140 c for 4 h in an autoclave followed by measurements using the spectrophotometric phosphomolybdate blue method lin et al 2016 concentrations of dip were directly determined without digestion and the amount of dop was acquired from the difference between tdp and dip the detection limit was generally between 8 and 10 nm based on replicate blank sample measurements with a precision 2 for both tdp and dip at 0 1 μm level tpp was measured following high temperature combustion and acid hydrolysis of the filters as described by solórzano and sharp 1980 with some improvements by zhang et al 2010 briefly the filters were wetted with 0 5 m mgcl2 solution and heated in a drying oven at 95 c until dryness and then organic p compounds were decomposed by ashing in a furnace at 550 c for 2 h the residue was extracted with 1 m hcl solution at room temperature for 24 h the sample for pip was also extracted using 1 m hcl solution at room temperature for 24 h aspila et al 1976 after neutralization and dilution both extractions of tpp and pip were quantified following the dip method concentrations of pop were obtained by subtracting pip from tpp cai et al 2008 the analytical precision for tpp and pip were 1 concentrations of spm were determined by finding the weight difference between the particulate matter retained on the dried filters and blank filters before filtration the filter samples were dried to constant weights and reweighed and the levels of spm were calculated from net dry weights and filtered water sample volumes according to lin et al 2016 and dan et al 2019 chl a was extracted in 10 ml 90 v v hplc grade acetone in the dark at 4 c for 24 h and measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4500 hitachi co japan after centrifugation parsons et al 1984 instrument calibration was done with chl a standard from spinach sigma aldrich c5753 the analytical precision for chl a was 3 yang et al 2018a 2 4 distribution coefficient the partitioning of p between dissolved and particulate phases can be quantified using the conditional distribution coefficient kd due to the proportional differences in p phases in this study the p data for the western and eastern flanks were pooled together to calculate kd in order to fully comprehend the biogeochemical behavior of p in surface water of the mws turner 1996 prastka et al 1998 lin et al 2012 the kd is given as follows 1 k d c p c d spm where cp and cd are the concentrations of particulate and dissolved p all in μm including inorganic and organic p pools respectively spm is the concentration of suspended particulate matter g ml therefore the dimension of kd is in ml g and the value of kd is expressed as log kd lin et al 2013 2 5 two end member mixing model the two end member mixing model was built on mass balance equations for salinity and the component of two water masses li et al 2017 yang et al 2018a 2 f 1 f 2 1 3 s 1 f 1 s 2 f 2 s where f 1 and f 2 represent the fractions of the freshwater and seawater end members respectively s1 and s2 represent the salinity of the two end members thus the prediction of the specific p concentration p m was based on the two end member model calculated as follows 4 p m p 1 f 1 p 2 f 2 where p 1 and p 2 are the specific p concentration of the two end members respectively the difference between the predicted value and the ambient value is defined as δp and calculated following equation below 5 δ p p m n where n is the value of the ambient phosphorus concentration in the water sample a negative δp value implies dip addition while a positive value indicates dip removal here it is important to emphasize that there are some limitations in the use of the binary mixing model in this study first the salinity of the freshwater endmember s1 does not truly represent the freshwater salinity normally this condition would have been met at the upstream regions beyond tidal reversal secondly the salinity of the saltwater end member s2 during this study see table 1 appears to be largely influenced by continuous freshwater supply and limited salt water influx from the beibu gulf to the mws thus it is possible that the near freshwater conditions i e western flank site 1 and eastern flank site 10 at the norther regions during this study summer wet season may change at other seasons when there is a reduced riverine freshwater outflow and enhanced saltwater influx apparently the lower salinity of the starting sampling sites at each flank of the mws was an average value measured during the flood and ebb tides during this study thus this allows the evaluation of the influence of riverine influx on the bioavailability of dip whereby the deviations maybe somewhat subject to some sort of non conservative processes at the western and eastern flank of the mws during the wet summer season 2 6 statistical analysis and graphing data analysis was done using the statistical program for the social science spss version 22 0 spss inc ibm armonk ny usa here one way analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate whether the difference in the mean level of the studied parameters between the western and eastern flanks was statistically significant at 95 confidence limit data normality was checked using kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk test pearson s correlation analysis with a two tailed test of significance 99 and 95 confidence interval was done to evaluate the relationship of the measured physicochemical parameters and p species plots showing the distributions of the measured parameters were produced using origin 9 0 originlab usa while the map of the study area showing the sampling sites were produced using ocean data view odv version 5 2 1 software sclitzer reiner ocean data view https odv awi de 2020 3 results 3 1 physicochemical parameters the levels and distributions of physicochemical parameters in surface water are presented in table 1 and fig s1a d salinity ranged from 0 63 to 15 07 psu at the western flank and 1 17 17 96 psu at the eastern flank and showed an obvious increasing trend from the northern to the southern regions of the mws at both blanks fig s1a ph at the western and eastern flank ranged from 7 86 8 98 average 8 28 0 43 and 7 46 8 89 average 8 10 0 49 respectively although ph showed a general decreasing trend from site 1 to site 6 and then increased to site 9 at the western flank its distributional trend at the eastern flank generally increased from the northern region to the southern region fig s1b eh ranged from 49 183 mv average 98 47 mv and 29 152 mv average 92 44 mv at the western and eastern flanks respectively suggesting that the surface water in mws was somewhat oxidative during this study fig s1c the levels of spm ranged from 34 7 to 88 3 mg l average 47 2 16 9 mg l at the western flank and 31 0 to 57 5 mg l average 41 1 10 6 mg l at the eastern flank high variability in spm was observed at the northern regions between sites 1 4 at the western flank where salinity was 5 psu but remained somewhat stable at higher salinity sites fig s1d water temperature ranged from 29 6 c 30 6 c average 29 9 0 30 c at the western flank and 30 0 c 30 3 c average 30 1 0 12 c at the eastern flank and the distributional patterns were somewhat similar to that of spm especially at the eastern flank fig s1e the level of chl a ranged from 1 95 7 95 μg l average 4 25 1 99 μg l at the western flank and 1 32 7 35 μg l average 4 59 2 21 μg l at the eastern flank the distributional patterns of chl a at the western and eastern flanks were similar showing a progressive increasing trend fig s1f as salinity increases from the northern to the southern regions of the mws do ranged from 5 52 6 44 mg l average 6 03 0 31 mg l and 5 65 6 34 mg l average 5 88 0 30 mg l at the western and eastern flanks respectively showing that the surface water in mws is well oxygenated the distributional trends decreased from the northern to the southern region of the mws at both flanks fig s1g generally there was no significant difference anova p 0 05 in the mean levels of the physicochemical parameters between the western and eastern flanks of the mws during this study 3 2 distributions of din don and dsi the concentrations and distributions of din and dsi in surface water at the western and eastern flanks of the mws are shown in table s1 fig s1h and in fig s2a b respectively there was a significant variation anova p 0 05 in the mean concentration of don with exception of din and dsi between the western and eastern flanks of the mws din ranged from 22 77 to 81 32 μm average 41 64 16 92 μm and 32 69 80 02 49 2 18 0 μm at the western and eastern flanks respectively din was the major form of tdn at both flanks fig s2c d and its concentration trend gradually decreased with an increasing salinity from the north to south in the mws fig s2a among the different din species no3 was the dominant form which singly accounted for 42 4 and 54 7 of tdn in the western and eastern flanks respectively fig s2c d don accounted for 44 7 of tdn in the western flank which was higher than average contribution 23 3 of don to tdn at the eastern flank fig s2c d although the surface water spm during this study was generally 100 mg l the elevated no3 in the mws may be related to slow nitrification process as nh4 and no2 averagely accounted for 30 of the din at both flanks during this study moreover short term localized nitrification process may have accounted for lower don concentrations compared to no3 at the eastern flank the concentrations of dsi ranged from 7 40 41 01 μm average 23 58 11 32 μm and 7 21 34 20 μm average 25 27 11 70 μm at the western and eastern flanks of the mws respectively and showed a gradually decreasing trend with increasing salinity from the northern to the southern regions of the mws fig s1h while the distribution of dsi appears to be dominantly influenced by land based sources dissolved n species tends to be influenced by both terrestrial input and biogeochemical processes within the mws similar trends have been reported in the dafengjiang river estuary in the northern beibu gulf yang et al 2018a 3 3 distributions of dissolved p and molar ratios concentrations of dip dop and tdp in the mws are presented in table 2 the distributional trends are depicted in fig 2 a b and fig 2e f no significant differences anova p 0 05 was observed in the mean level of dissolved p except for dop between the western and eastern flank of the mws dip ranged from 0 71 4 04 μm average 1 60 0 99 μm and 0 86 2 43 μm average 1 41 0 56 μm while dop ranged from 0 79 4 05 μm average 2 20 0 97 μm and 1 02 3 71 μm average 2 37 0 99 μm at the western and eastern flanks of the mws respectively generally decreasing dip concentrations with increasing salinity from the northern to the southern regions of the mws were observed at both flanks fig 2a b the average concentrations of dop at both flanks were somewhat comparable but the distributions were highly variable showing an increasing tendency as salinity increases from the north to south in the mws fig 2a b the distributions of dissolved p forms i e dip and dop in this study are consistent with the observations in jiulong river estuary lin et al 2013 the concentration of tdp ranged from 3 01 4 83 μm average 3 81 0 70 μm and 3 02 4 57 μm average 3 78 0 60 μm at the western and eastern flanks respectively at the western flank tdp had first decreased from 4 33 µm salinity 0 63 psu at site 1 to 3 01 µm salinity 1 02 psu at site 3 varied from 3 20 4 06 µm at sites 4 7 salinity 1 76 5 39 psu then increased to 4 76 µm salinity 9 00 psu and finally decreased to 3 50 µm at site 9 salinity 15 00 psu fig 2e the average concentrations of tdp at both flanks were comparable probably due to similar dop levels the levels of dip and dop in the tdp pool varied widely across the investigated sites at each flank dip and dop accounted for 14 9 83 6 average 41 9 20 2 and 16 4 85 1 average 58 1 20 2 fig 3 a and 18 8 70 4 average of 38 9 18 5 and 29 6 81 2 average 61 1 18 5 fig 3b of the tdp pool at the western and eastern flanks respectively considering the entire dataset in this study the molar din dip ratios ranged from 12 to 68 average 33 13 dsi din ratios varied from 0 16 0 96 average 0 57 0 27 while dsi dip ratios ranged from 6 26 average 17 6 fig 4 this stoichiometric relationship between din and dsi with dip have important implication for the plankton community which may also serve as an indicator for the evaluation of nutrient limitation in the mws 3 4 spatial variations of particulate inorganic and organic p the concentration and distribution of various particulate p species are presented in table 2 fig 2c d just like the dissolved p phase there was no significant variation anova p 0 05 in the mean concentration of particulate p except for pop between the western and eastern flanks of the mws the concentration of pip ranged from 0 84 3 13 μm average 1 75 0 84 μm and 0 82 1 71 μm average 1 09 0 34 μm while pop ranged from 0 42 1 16 μm average 0 76 0 27 μm and 0 28 0 73 μm average 0 49 0 17 μm at the western and eastern flanks respectively the distributional trend of pip at the western flank is similar to that at the eastern flank which showed a generally decreasing trend as salinity increases from the north to south in the mws fig 2c d slight changes were observed in the distributional trend of pip at the eastern flank at first pip showed a decreasing trend as salinity increases and then slightly increased at the higher salinity sites 14 and 15 fig 2d which also corresponded with sites where elevated spm levels were recorded at the eastern flank fig s1d pop varied minimally with no distinctive trend in its distribution patterns at both flanks fig 2c d tpp concentrations ranged from 1 45 4 13 μm average 2 51 0 98 μm and 1 23 2 37 μm average 1 59 0 41 μm and showed a gradually decreasing trend at the western flank and eastern flank respectively within the particulate p pool pip dominated the particulate p phase accounting for 68 1 9 5 and 69 1 9 1 fig 3c while pop only accounted for 31 9 9 5 and 30 9 9 1 at the western flank and eastern flank fig 3d respectively considering both dissolved and particulate p phases dissolved p was the predominant phase in the total p pool accounting for 61 1 and 70 7 while particulate p only accounted for 38 9 and 29 3 at the western flank and eastern flank fig 5 respectively as the salinity increased the increasing tdp tp ratios in the surface water were comparable to the decreasing in tpp tp ratios at the western flank fig 3e and eastern flank fig 3f suggesting a transformation of p between dissolved and particulate phases in surface water of the mws in addition the partitioning of p between dissolved and particulate phases was quantitatively evaluated using its distribution coefficient kd considering the entire dataset the p log kd values obtained for the mws ranged from 3 83 to 4 34 with an average of 4 09 0 18 fig 6 a the average p log kd in this study is slightly lower compared to values reported for other study areas such the bay of st louis 4 96 lin et al 2012 jiulong river estuary 4 57 lin et al 2013 and pearl river estuary 4 51 li et al 2017 4 discussion 4 1 dissolved inorganic and organic p status and nutrient ratios the levels of dip and dop in mws during this study in comparison with other worldwide estuaries and bays are presented in table 3 it is important to highlight here that escalated anthropogenic activities have resulted in many reported cases of aquatic environmental degradation e g zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2020a 2020b and are responsible for the alteration of the global biogeochemical cycles in recent years the effects of land use change on the remobilization of p including the rate at which inorganic fertilizer is widely used for agricultural practices in many watersheds soil erosion and local sewage discharge have significantly increased the tons of p and the frequency of algal outbreak and eutrophication in estuaries and marginal seas mackenzie et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 many estuaries and coastal water experiences occasional and or frequent algal bloom and eutrophication due to increasing human impacts in chinese coastal regions duan et al 2008 pan and wang 2012 yan et al 2012 concentrations of dip in eutrophic aquatic systems exceed 0 1 mg l 1 i e 3 2 μm and exceeds the proportions of dop in the tdp pool lemley et al 2015 examples of such eutrophic aquatic systems are the scheldt estuary van der zee et al 2007 jiulong river estuary lin et al 2013 and danshuei river estuary fang and wang 2020 table 3 where elevated dip concentrations have been heavily attributed to anthropogenic input alvarez vazquez et al 2016 however there are other eutrophic aquatic systems such as the pearl river estuary lu et al 2009 and the nile river estuary abdel satar et al 2017 where dop dominates the tdp pool although rivers and or ground waters are the main sources of terrestrial dissolved nutrients in estuaries and coastal waters studies have shown that elevated dop or don pools are also largely delivered from natural sources in coastal waters e g dan et al 2019 wang et al 2020a 2020b thus the amount and characteristics of dissolved inorganic or organic p in most estuaries and coastal marine systems may not entirely depend on anthropogenic perturbations but on autochthonous sources as well as the economic functionality of an aquatic system as shown in table 3 the concentrations of dip in the mws were lower to medium range compared to other aquatic systems in different regions while dop was generally higher than other referenced systems it is important to note that p is mostly adsorbed by soil particles and spm and the adsorption capacity may increase as the levels of fe oxyhydr oxides calcium aluminum and or organic matter increases in waters particularly the presence of fe oxyhydr oxides or biogenic apatite effectively limits the dissolution of p and its availability in the water column liu et al 2004 lower concentrations of dip in many chinese coastal waters have been attributed high adsorption on particulate matter e g liu et al 2009 moreover china is the largest mariculture producer in the world with an annual production of 17 million tons mt of seaweed and shellfish mariculture moac 2017 and mws is the largest oyster mariculture bay in southwest china therefore elevated surface water dop would be expected in most of the chinese coastal waters including mariculture bays due to biological productions although eutrophication occasionally occurs in the mws the overall contribution of dip to surface water eutrophication in the mws seems less even as anthropogenic input may have accounted for the elevated dip which exceeded the threshold for eutrophication at the western flank site 2 table 2 fig 2a in summary it is likely that the higher proportions of dop compared to dip in the mws and the difference in the concentrations of dissolved p between the mws and other aquatic systems in the literature may be attributed to different sources of p within the watershed the level of biological productivity and biogeochemical processes influencing p concentrations and dynamics generally phytoplankton growth rate can be limited by one or more essential macronutrients thus the control of primary production by nutrients has occasioned much research on the metabolic characteristics of phytoplankton in many freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems because din dip and dsi can stimulate phytoplankton blooms including harmful algal bloom species habs in coastal areas the typical redfield brzezinski molar ratios of si to n 1 1 and n to p 16 1 are used to represent nutrient stoichiometric requirements for a balanced plankton growth in both freshwater and coastal marine systems redfield 1963 brzezinski 1985 for example the abundance of dsi is an important stimulant for diatoms growth which helps in transferring energy to higher trophic levels due to higher grazing potential of higher organism such as zooplankton on diatoms conley et al 1993 this implies that non diatom plankton that may not require dsi for growth may dominate phytoplankton community if dsi is limiting and this may reduce the trophic importance of diatoms in aquatic systems based on laboratory bioassay dip may potentially limit primary productivity when the ambient molar ratios of din dip and dsi dip exceeds 22 justić et al 1995 in addition experimental study by hu et al 1990 showed that dip might be potentially limiting when din dip exceeds 30 while din limitation would occur when din dip is 8 for phytoplankton production moreover kahlert 1998 reported that dip bio limitation may occur when din dip is 32 while din bio limitation would occur if din dip is 12 for phytoplankton production during this study the mean molar din dip ratio was generally higher than the typical redfield brzezinski ratio and higher than the experimental ratios reported for din and dip limitations in the literature hu et al 1990 justić et al 1995 kahlert 1998 implying that primary productivity in the mws is strongly limited by dip although the dsi dip ratios obtained in this study were elevated the dsi din ratios were less than the typical redfield brzezinski ratios suggesting that dsi may co limit primary productivity in the mws the differences in the nutritional needs of plankton assemblages and biogeochemical processes may have accounted for the spatial variability of nutrient molar ratios as observed in this study fig 4 based on the assumption that dop in the mws is composed of lower molecular weight compounds which could be assimilated by microbial community when dip is not enough to provide the nutritional needs of living aquatic organisms the stoichiometric relationship between din and dip dop was evaluated considering the whole dataset the molar din dip dop ratios in this study ranged from 8 to 23 with an average of 12 4 this showed that dop is not limiting when scaled to the redfield brzezinski ratio implying that dop may be nutritionally important in the mws because extant microorganism community may simultaneously assimilate dop as well as dip however changes in molar ratios of the dissolved nutrients in the mws especially as dsi and dip may potentially co limit primary productivity would affect the proportions and functionality of phytoplankton community egge and aksnes 1992 conley et al 1993 therefore the findings in this study suggested that changes in nutrient ratios and dominance of din may have important implications on the algal outbreak frequently reported in the mws in recent years 4 2 relationship between p and physicochemical parameters the correlations between nutrients and surface water physicochemical parameters such as salinity ph and chl a have important implications on the sources and biogeochemical behavior of nutrients including p in coastal waters pearson correlation analysis with a two tail level of significance was conducted on p species physicochemical parameters and related nutrients contents obtained during this study from the western and eastern flanks of the mws to have an in depth understanding of the influencing factors on different p species in the mws it is important to note that modifications in nutrient concentrations occur in most coastal marine systems that are influenced by multiple stressors for instance significant negative correlation between nutrients and salinity may indicate that saltwater dilution may likely be among the most important factor affecting nutrient concentrations with the assumption that nutrients in the system of interest are dominantly derived from riverine source dan et al 2019 thus the deviation from such relationships may be attributed to other factors that either add or remove nutrients from surface water in this study the result from pearson correlation analysis showed negative relationship between different p species and salinity except for dop table 4 the generally decreasing trend of dip pip pop and tpp from the north to south in the mws fig 2a f and their positive relationship with din and dsi table 4 indicated that the surface water p is mostly delivered from the adjoining rivers to the mws this is consistent with the previous observations in the study area yang et al 2012 on the other hand p is prone to form insoluble particulate compounds through adsorption oxidation reduction complexation and co precipitation with organic matter metal oxides and or ions in aquatic environment he et al 2009 a slight increase in pip contents at the southern region of the eastern flank station 15 may have resulted from sediment resuspension during tidal mixing this may be possible as previous study had reported that sedimentary p in the mws is dominantly composed of inorganic p yang et al 2019b dan et al 2020a although surface water pop can increase via in situ marine primary production jensen et al 1995 yang et al 2018b the gradual increase in surface water pop around the southern region of the eastern flank site 14 in the mws may have also resulted from sediment resuspension in overall the relationship between tpp with spm was positive and significant r 0 52 p 0 05 while significant negative relationship was observed between tpp and chl a r 0 57 p 0 05 these imply that both the spm and primary productivity played different roles in particulate p dynamics in the mws generally dop dominated the tdp pool in the mws during this study as discussed earlier section 4 1 the ph values table 1 in the investigated sites show that alkalinity thrives in surface water of the mws increase in ph causes a shift in phosphate speciation from h2po4 to hpo4 2 and when dissolved p is present in the form of hpo4 2 in alkaline environment it would be easy for ca2 and carbonate to produce insoluble p species by co precipitation wang et al 2012 resulting in lower dip concentrations as observed in this study similar to pop dop also generally increased as chl a increased along the salinity gradients from the northern to the southern regions at the western and eastern flanks of the mws although somewhat variable the correlation between chl a and dop was positive and significant r 0 68 p 0 01 table 4 suggesting that dop is relevant for phytoplankton production in the mws dip showed a significant negative correlation with chl a r 0 52 p 0 05 table 4 which indicated that the reduction in dip in surface water of the mws was also partly related to phytoplankton utilization the average molar don dop ratio during this study was 15 7 which is almost the same as the redfield n p ratio of 16 1 required for phytoplankton balanced growth redfield 1963 dan et al 2019 this suggested that the concentrations of don and dop are optimal from plankton utilization and that the sources i e besides anthropogenic input and distribution of dop are somewhat influenced by the growth and metabolism of primary producers in surface water of the mws concentration of dop exceeding that of dip have been frequently reported in estuarine and coastal surface waters attributed to phytoplankton production enhancing the dop released into the seawater e g van beusekom and de jonge 2012 duan et al 2016 therefore primary productivity by marine plankton plays important role in the concentrations and dynamics of dop in the mws 4 3 transformation and partitioning of p between dissolved and particulate phases various p species can vary significantly in concentrations between dissolved and particulate phases along salinity gradients during mixing processes in aquatic environments and environmental mixing conditions induces p removal migration regeneration and transformation between different species lin et al 2012 particulate p is important in the cycling of p in coastal waters and can be transformed into dissolved p by the direct extracellular release from phytoplankton sloppy feeding by crustacean zooplankton and cytolysis by viral infection and release of ingested prey organic matter by protozoan grazers or desorption although the concentration trend of tpp generally decreased from sites 1 9 at the western flank our results showed a considerable increase in tdp as tpp declined at salinity range of 3 9 psu around the estuary regions at the western flank fig 2e potentially this indicated that there was desorption and release of p from particulate p phase during estuarine mixing at the western flank at the eastern flank it appeared that the reduction in tpp with the corresponding increase in tdp concentrations obviously occurred across the sampling sites where salinity ranged from 1 17 17 96 psu fig 2f generally the sharp decline in tdp in the relatively high salinity of 13 18 psu and 9 15 psu sites at the eastern and western flanks respectively fig 2e f suggesting that there was a rapid p removal behavior during later mixing this may be because fine grained particles can easily adsorb large amount of tdp by flocculation in saline water environment which settle to the sediment resulting in the decrease of tdp concentrations magni et al 2002 therefore these observations showed that the dynamic transformations of p between dissolved and particulate phase at varying salinity is possible in surface water at the western and eastern flanks of the mws at the western flank the decrease in the concentration of dip between the lower salinity 0 65 psu site 2 and higher salinity 9 35 psu site 8 was 3 33 μm and comparable to the corresponding increase in dop 3 26 μm at these sites the near balance between dip and dop at the lower and higher salinity regions showed that there is a potential transformation of p between dip and dop in surface water of the mws at the western flank along the salinity gradients at the eastern flank the decrease in dip 1 57 μm was obviously lower than the corresponding increase in dop 2 69 μm but the sum of the reduction in tpp and dip i e 2 71 μm almost balanced the increase in dop therefore increase in dop is related to fact that dip is readily assimilated by aquatic organisms and excreted in the form of dop or desorbed and released from particulate p lin et al 2013 for the eastern flank it may be that zooplankton fed on phytoplankton that utilizes large amount of dip and then metabolized to insoluble particulate p which releases lower dip to surface water as also reported in other study areas e g benitez nelson 2000 yoshimura et al 2018 previous studies have also shown that dip can be transformed biologically to dop through assimilation by marine phytoplankton and or bacteria ruttenberg 2003 this conclusion can be supported by the significantly negative correlation between dip and dop r 0 75 p 0 01 in the mws table 4 in summary a large scale migration and or transformation among p species occurred between the dissolved and particulate phases facilitated by complex biogeochemical processes during estuarine mixing at the western and eastern flanks of the mws generally a two step mechanism for adsorption of dip by particles is 1 one that proceeds via a fast reaction kinetic step through adsorption or desorption on the particles surface and 2 through the diffusion of phosphate into the interior of particles that occur in a longer time scale froelich 1988 hence if the kinetic reaction time is slower than the flushing time of an aquatic ecosystem the chemical reaction processes between dissolved and particulate p phases will not reach equilibrium morris 1990 fang 2000 therefore the non equilibrium in the dissolved and particulate p phase may be dependent on the relative time scales of adsorption or desorption processes of different p species due to the continuous inflow of freshwater from the adjoining rivers irregular diurnal tidal incursion and changes in spm concentrations induced by sediment resuspension along salinity gradients this may account for the slightly lower and wider range of p log kd values cai et al 2012 as obtained in the mws compared to other study areas caraco et al 1990 showed a decrease in p log kd values as salinity increases due to sulphate competition for adsorption sites such process promotes desorption at higher salinity in this study the p log kd decreased as salinity increases especially at the eastern flank fig 6a in addition to some factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs the decrease in p log kd may be attributed to desorption of p from the particles because of competition from seawater major anions such as cl and so4 that form soluble chloro and sulfato complexes with metals in solution a significant negative relationship was also found between the p log kd versus spm especially at the eastern flank fig 6b indicating that p has a strong particle reactivity in the mws moreover particle concentration effect may have played an important role in regulating the partitioning of inorganic p and tp between dissolved and particulate phases li et al 2017 consistent with the findings in the southwest region of lake michigan lin and guo 2016 in contrast the weak correlation between the p log kd and spm at the western flank showed that indeed several indirect processes affecting p partitioning between the dissolved and particulate phases are related to biological factors especially for dop and pop while dip and pip were mostly influenced by physicochemical factors in summary the differences in p log kd values between the mws and other coastal marine systems e g lin et al 2012 lin and guo 2016 li et al 2017 may be generally dependent on the levels and spatial distributions of salinity spm ph aerobic conditions the texture of particles adsorbed p sources of p flushing time river flow rate dissolved organic matter colloidal p content and alkalinity 4 4 effect of rivers discharge on p dynamics studies on the influence of riverine discharge on p dynamics are important for understanding the biogeochemical behavior of p as mentioned in section 2 1 the annual freshwater discharge from the maolingjiang river and qinjiang river into the mws is 25 9 108 m3 y 1 and 20 3 108 m3 y 1 respectively and these rivers also co deliver 8 6 104 tons y 1 of suspended sediment load into the mws chen et al 2018 however these amount are far less compared to the annual freshwater discharge from other chinese rivers such the pearl river discharge 3 3 1011 m3 y 1 suspended load 85 107 tons y 1 li et al 2017 and dafengjiang river discharge 18 3 109 m3 y 1 suspended load 11 77 104 tons y 1 yang et al 2018a apparently more than 80 of these discharges occur during the wet season months may september in the mws and nearby aquatic systems nevertheless the average tdp 3 84 μm and tpp 2 14 μm in the mws are significantly higher than the amount previously reported in nearby aquatic systems such as the dafengjiang river estuary tdp 1 05 μm tpp 0 19 μm yang et al 2018a and pearl river estuary tdp 1 92 μm tpp 1 50 μm li et al 2017 during the wet season the lower concentrations of surface water p in the pearl river estuary were reported to be significantly influenced by strong stratification which had favored the settlement of spm supplied by freshwater discharge and thus enhancing more dip uptake for primary productivity li et al 2017 on the other hand lower surface water p phases in the dafengjiang river estuary were attributed to lower p export by the rivers and less anthropogenic p input yang et al 2018a moreover the reduction in surface water p in the dafengjiang river estuary surface water also resulted from rapid water exchange between the dafengjiang river estuary and the beibu gulf compared to the nearby aquatic systems with high freshwater discharge rates it is most likely that differences in dissolved p relative to particulate p in the mws may result from differences in biogeochemical and physical processes among all p species in dissolved and particulate phases dip is the most readily bioavailable for primary productivity in surface water and the continuous freshwater supply limited water exchange between the mws and the beibu gulf and primary productivity may have had an important implication on the concentrations and distributions of dip in the mws thus we applied a two end member mixing model to distinguish the influences of the physical or biological factors on dip variability in the mws at the western flank the freshwater and saltwater end members for surface water salinity and dip concentrations were 0 63 psu and 1 88 μm and 15 07 psu and 1 33 μm selected from sites 1 and 9 respectively tables 1 and 2 at the eastern flank the freshwater and saltwater end members for surface water salinity and dip concentrations were 1 17 psu and 2 43 μm and 17 96 psu and 0 91 μm selected from sites 10 and 15 respectively tables 1 and 2 as shown in fig 6c and the deviation from the theoretical mixing line positive deviations were found at most of the stations except for the negative deviation at site 2 for the western flank fig 6d the positive deviation suggested that dip variability at the western and eastern flanks of the mws is also dominantly controlled by biological utilization in addition to absorption desorption processes dip addition was observed near the mouth of the maolingjiang river estuary where industries are clustered zhang et al 2019 which likely contributed to the replenishment of dip from the perennial industrial sewage discharge from our data we found that the reduction in dip was 1 24 μm and 1 55 μm at the western and eastern flanks respectively as estimated by the two end member model thus it is likely that the bioavailability of dip for phytoplankton uptake is somewhat higher at the eastern flank supported by the relatively higher average chl a than at the western flank of the mws therefore multiple biogeochemical processes control the dynamics of p under the influence of riverine input in surface water of the mws 5 conclusion this study focused on the p biogeochemistry in dissolved and particulate phases in surface water at the western and eastern flanks of the maowei sea mws total dissolved p tdp dominated tdp tp 61 2 70 6 the total p tp pool dissolved organic p dop dominated dop tdp 58 1 61 1 the tdp pool in contrast to dissolved p phase the total particulate p tpp pool was dominated by inorganic p pip which accounted for 68 1 69 1 of tpp the dominance of tdp pool indicated that the delivery of p from rivers to coastal sea in dissolved phase is as important as particulate phase especially in less turbid aquatic systems dip level in the mws is lower to medium range compared to other estuarine and coastal systems while dop is somewhat elevated in the mws due to the prevailing intensive mariculture in the mws biological production and or dissolution from fecal debris and detritus increasing anthropogenic sources from the catchment and or watershed may also have accounted for the increase in the levels of dip or dop the readily bioavailable p species which may worsen the frequency of eutrophication depending on how the mws would respond to external p load the stoichiometric relationship between dip din and dsi suggested that dip is potentially bio limiting in the mws while dsi may co limit plankton growth the dynamic changes transformation and distribution of p in dissolved and particulate phases are controlled by physicochemical conditions freshwater discharge and biological activities in the mws a partitioning coefficient kd approach which was used to examine the partitioning of p and its particle reactivity showed that particle concentration effect along the salinity gradients contributed to the partitioning of p between the dissolved and particulate phase although subject to some limitations the two end member mixing model suggested that dip was also influenced by biological factors such as phytoplankton uptake in most of the studied sites overall the study on the dynamic changes in the concentrations spatial distribution and transformation process of different p species between dissolved and particulate phases can effectively reveal the biogeochemical behavior of p as well as understanding the internal relationship between the biogeochemical cycling of p and eutrophication

4925,phosphorus p is an important biogenic element that limits algal growth and influences primary productivity and biogeochemical cycling of other biogenic elements in freshwater and marine ecosystems surface water samples were collected along the salinity gradients from the western and eastern flanks of the maowei sea mws during july 2018 for measurements of different p species including dissolved nitrogen and silicate total dissolved p tdp dominated the total p tp accounting for 64 9 9 7 of tp possibly due to relatively less suspended particulate matter 100 mg l among the dissolved p species dissolved organic p dop was more abundant dop tdp 58 1 20 than dissolved inorganic p dip considering the entire dataset the average dip concentration 1 53 0 83 μm was lower to medium range while dop was relatively higher compared to other estuaries and coastal waters bodies worldwide particulate p was mainly present as particulate inorganic p pip which accounted for 68 5 9 0 of the total particulate p tpp the behavior of different p species along the salinity gradients indicated that their concentrations were dominantly influenced by riverine inputs and biogeochemical processes intensive mariculture activities in the mws may have also contributed to elevated dop compared to other coastal marine systems worldwide apart from similar sources of input and cycling processes the stoichiometric relationship between dip dissolved inorganic n din and dissolved silicate dsi suggested that p is potentially limiting while si may co limit primary productivity the latitudinal distribution of different p species indicated that strong transformations existed between the particulate and dissolved p phases along the salinity gradients the negative relationship between p partitioning coefficient log kd and salinity and with suspended particulate matter log spm suggested that strong particle reactivity and probable competition between dissolved p with other anions for adsorption sites influenced the partitioning of p species in surface water additionally the end member binary model showed that 1 24 1 55 μm of dip may have been removed through biological uptake in summary this study shows that the dynamic changes in the concentrations spatial distribution and transformation process of different p species between dissolved and particulate phases can effectively reveal the sources of p and understand the internal relationship between the biogeochemical cycling of p stoichiometric status and eutrophication keywords phosphorus chemical speciation biogeochemical processes maowei sea 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential bio limiting macronutrient in the biosphere and play crucial roles in regulating ecosystem function and primary productivity in freshwater and coastal marine systems björkman and karl 2003 slomp et al 2004 yang et al 2018a the lower concentration of p in many aquatic environments is partly due to the solubility of apatite being the commonest naturally occurring mineral containing p in the earth s crust in freshwater which is generally 0 4 wt ayers and watson 1991 and thus the dissolved p levels in pristine or less contaminated environments are generally 0 5 μm other biogenic elements such as nitrogen n and silica si are also essential for the ecological sustainability of an aquatic ecosystem therefore the contents and distributions of n and si in dissolved phase and their stoichiometric relationships with p may generally influence nutrient structures and behavior with important ecological implications on primary productivity and phytoplankton species composition duan et al 2016 dan et al 2019 in the last three decades anthropogenic perturbations in coastal areas have increased the concentration of dissolved inorganic p dip up to 2 3 fold in some larger rivers worldwide wang et al 2018 cozzi et al 2019 comparatively dip concentrations in small medium river systems and bays have become elevated exceeding 10 μm than in the world s large rivers van der zee et al 2007 eliani russak et al 2013 due to industrial and agricultural activities around small river basins that lack stringent regulations of local government and especially in bays that have weak capacity of self purification pan et al 2020 the loading of p beyond pristine levels mostly results in eutrophication and bottom water hypoxia due to an abnormal algal production in estuarine and coastal marine environments lin et al 2018 total p tp has been reported as an insufficient measure to evaluate p speciation and predict its potential bioavailability in coastal waters e g dan et al 2020a 2020b however studies on different forms of p i e inorganic or organic with their different chemical reactivity and speciation have been proposed to understand the biogeochemical behavior and bioavailability of p not only in sediments but also in the water column thus knowledge of the abundance speciation distributions and transformation of p is essential for a better understanding of p behavior and ecosystem quality in coastal marine environments benitez nelson 2000 lin et al 2016 yang et al 2016 in natural waters tp is mainly partitioned into dissolved inorganic p dip dissolved organic p dop particulate inorganic p pip and particulate organic p pop phases van der zee et al 2007 lin et al 2012 karl 2014 lin and guo 2016 the pip and pop together constitutes the total particulate p tpp pool while dop and dip together constitutes the total dissolved p tdp pool aquatic living creatures or detrital organic matter are the major components of pop while pip occurs in mineral phases with complex components duan et al 2016 li et al 2017 which includes the adsorbed p and co precipitated p with calcium and or fe oxyhydr oxides house 2003 vilmin et al 2015 generally dip consists of orthophosphate po4 3 pyrophosphate pyrop and polyphosphate polyp of which po4 3 being the most dominant with high reactivity among others is preferentially utilized by phytoplankton while some phytoplankton cannot directly assimilate pyrop and polyp duan et al 2016 diaz et al 2016 similar to dip recent studies have revealed that phytoplankton or microbial community can also assimilate low molecular weight dop under special aquatic environmental conditions when dip is not enough to provide the nutritional needs of living aquatic organisms yoshimura et al 2014 li et al 2017 therefore information about dop is also of scientific significance since the extant microorganism community may assimilate dip and dop simultaneously especially if dop is more abundant and bioavailable relative to dip in natural waters björkman and karl 2003 several factors can influence concentration and distribution of dip and dop in coastal waters for example the absorbed dip and dop on suspended particulate matter spm which is massively transported by rivers and can be desorbed in estuaries and coastal waters due to increasing salinity paytan and mclaughlin 2007 jordan et al 2008 yang et al 2018a studies show that 87 of the particle bound p in the oceans is delivered through global riverine supply e g jensen et al 2006 because p is highly reactive to water borne particulate matter the tpp often accounts for a larger proportion of tp than tdp especially in turbid spm 100 mg l riverine and nearshore waters nevertheless tpp may be an important contributor of dissolved p through desorption processes even in less turbid aquatic environments due to dynamic changes in some physiochemical conditions and the regeneration or removal of dip might be related to p partitioning coefficient kd between dissolved and particulate phases prastka et al 1998 jordan et al 2008 in summary particulate p phase can serve as a potential source of dip and or dop for phytoplankton and microbial community growth and metabolism thus knowledge on dissolved and particulate p pool is important to evaluate the transformation potential of p and its bioavailability in estuarine and coastal marine environments maowei sea mws is a typical subtropical bay influenced mostly by the discharge of the maolingjiang river and qinjiang river and tidal influx from the beibu gulf through qinzhou bay and constitutes a unique estuary bay multi ecosystem with rich aquatic resources and conducive environment for oyster mariculture wei et al 2017 however frequent harmful algal blooms have been occurring recently in the mws due to the rapidly growing industrialization urbanization and intense mariculture activities in the watershed gu et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 previous studies in the mws have focused on sedimentary p yang et al 2019a 2019b dan et al 2020a reports show that inorganic p mainly in the form of fe bound p is generally the predominant form of sedimentary p in the mws and sedimentary p is dominantly derived from terrestrial sources moreover sediment textural characteristics distributions of organic matter hydrodynamics in addition to external input from agriculture drainage areas and aquaculture activities together play significant roles for the variation tendencies of different fractions of p in sediments yang et al 2019a 2019b dan et al 2020a the potential bioavailable p i e the labile p forms has been reported to account for more than 70 of the sedimentary tp in the mws yang et al 2019b on the other hand a comprehensive study focusing on p speciation in the water column of danshuei river estuary in northern taiwan showed that dip is strongly influenced by desorption from and adsorption onto pip of which pip accounted for 60 of tp in regions where salinity was 5 psu but decreased to 40 50 in the lower estuary where salinity exceeded 30 psu fang and wang 2020 generally the spatiotemporal variability in physicochemical factors including ph salinity water temperature spm in surface water of many coastal marine systems play different roles on p speciation distribution and bioavailability in the water column prastka and malcolm 1994 zhou et al 2016 shinohara et al 2018 however detailed information on the biogeochemistry of p and the transformation behavior between different p species and phases and their relationships with the spatial distribution of physicochemical parameters and related dissolved nutrients in surface water of the mws is lacking thus a systematic study into better understanding the biogeochemical behavior of all species of p in the mws is required given the importance of the mws and its environmental function for mariculture and fishery resources thus this study was conducted on surface water samples collected along the salinity gradients at the western and eastern flanks of the mws which are influenced by the major adjoining river and tributaries the objectives were as follows 1 quantify the abundance of different p species in dissolved and particulate phases in the mws 2 evaluate the dissolved p status in the mws and identify the limiting nutrients for primary production based on nutrients molar ratios 3 evaluate the relationship between different p species and physiochemical parameters such as salinity spm and chl a 4 explore the biogeochemical changes and partitioning of p between dissolved and particulate phases 5 apply a two end member mixing model to elucidate the influence of freshwater discharge on p removal addition 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the mws is a semi enclosed bay in the northern beibu gulf situated at the northwestern part of south china sea wang et al 2017 dan et al 2020a fig 1 a the surface area of the mws is approximately 135 km2 and the water depth is relatively shallow average 2 5 m liu et al 2016 gu et al 2018 the regional climate is controlled by the tropical maritime monsoon with annual air temperature ranging from 0 8 c to 37 4 c with an average of 22 1 c the mean annual rainfall is 2140 mm of which 80 85 falls during the rainy season from may to september meng et al 2016 chen et al 2018 the annual freshwater discharge from the maolingjiang river and qinjiang river the two largest rivers in the mws situated at the western and eastern flanks respectively is 25 9 108 m3 y 1 and 20 3 108 m3 y 1 respectively the main stream length of dalanjiang river is 21 33 km and its catchment area is only 62 3 km2 with a low freshwater discharge about 8 6 104 tons y 1 of suspended sediment is co delivered from these rivers into the mws chen et al 2018 irregular diurnal tides average tidal range 2 5 m exist along the coast with a maximum tidal elevation of 5 5 m tian et al 2014 chen et al 2018 the surface water circulation in the mws is anticyclonic and the water current from qinzhou bay enters and exit from the eastern and western coastal areas respectively xu et al 2020 the baggy geomorphology of mws together with the narrow outlet channel linking it with the qinzhou bay somewhat limits rapid water exchange between these two water bodies and beibu gulf zhang et al 2019 this condition makes the mws behaves like a typical subtropical estuary especially during the summer rainy season with surface salinity being generally 20 psu urban settlements dominate land use in the mws watershed and most of the northern regions are dominated by shrimp ponds the eastern catchment regions are also dominated by shrimp ponds including agricultural activities and mangrove forest while factories and agricultural farms are clustered around the western regions the natural mangrove reserve wetlands occupy an area of 2784 hm2 along the coastline of the mws the human population within 1 15 km of the region where the mws is located as of 2016 was 0 45 million inhabitants which represents 10 of the total qinzhou population in the guangxi province in china the mws is the largest natural oyster seedling and mariculture bay in china and the mangrove nature reserve is the most extensive in qinzhou bay the sea represents a significant economic developing region which has been gradually impacted by anthropogenic activities gu et al 2018 2 2 sampling field survey was carried out in july 2018 fifteen representative sampling stations were selected longitudinally along the salinity gradients starting from the northern and ending at the southern regions where the mws connects with the qinzhou bay fig 1b the sampling stations consisted of nine sites 1 9 at the western flank of the sea and six sites 10 15 at the eastern flank fig 1b the rational for selecting these sites was to capture the influence of the adjoining rivers such as the maolingjiang river and or the dalanjiang river at the western flank of the sea and qinjiang river at the eastern flank on biogeochemical behavior transformation and speciation of p in the mws considering that physicochemical factors such as salinity are greatly affected by tidal fluctuations the sampling was conducted simultaneously during the same tide time at the western and eastern flanks at each site surface water samples 1 m below surface were collected using niskin bottle water sampler volume 5 l and stored in pre acid cleaned 2 l hdpe plastic bottles in order to limit the possible changes in p species in the samples over time the collected samples were immediately stored in cooling container temperature 4 c in the field sampling physical parameters such as surface water salinity s temperature t ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured in situ using a pre calibrated multi parameter water quality probe ap 5000 aquaread co uk while the oxidation reduction potential eh was also measured in situ using a portable redox potentiometer thermofisher 4 star usa in the laboratory 300 ml of the water samples were filtered through pre combusted 0 45 µm nuclepore filters whatman 47 mm for the measurement of dissolved nitrite no2 nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 total dissolved n tdn dissolved silicate dsi tdp and dip the suspended solids retained on the filters were used for the measurement of spm tpp and pip concentrations additionally aliquot of 500 ml water samples was also filtered through pre combusted 0 7 μm gf f filters under low vacuum for chlorophyll a chl a analyses all sampling pretreatment were completed within 5 h the filtrates and filters were immediately preserved at 20 c in the laboratory until further analyses which were subsequently done within one month 2 3 laboratory analyses concentrations of no2 were measured by reacting no2 with aromatic amine while no3 and nh4 determinations were based on copper cadmium cu cd column reduction and indophenol blue color formation methods respectively the sum of no2 no3 and nh4 is hereafter reported as dissolved inorganic n din dsi was measured using a reducing reagent molybdate and oxalic acid the reaction products were quantified using the modified spectrophotometric methods of hansen and koroleff 1999 concentrations of no2 no3 nh4 and dsi were determined in the laboratory using an auto analyzer aa3 hr seal analytical ltd uk tdn was decomposed to no3 with boric acid persulfate oxidation solution k2s2o8 and h3bo3 in naoh solution this was done in an autoclave at 120 c for 0 5 h and then measured using an auto analyzer liu et al 2005 lin et al 2012 concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen don was calculated as the difference between tdn and din i e don tdn din the analytical precision was 5 for nutrients mentioned above yang et al 2018a the determination of tdp was based on an autoclave assisted acid persulfate method with modification according to lin et al 2012 in brief 10 ml of the filtered water sample and 1 ml of acidified k2s2o8 solution 50 g l ph 1 were added to a plug colorimetric tube and the mixed solution was digested at 140 c for 4 h in an autoclave followed by measurements using the spectrophotometric phosphomolybdate blue method lin et al 2016 concentrations of dip were directly determined without digestion and the amount of dop was acquired from the difference between tdp and dip the detection limit was generally between 8 and 10 nm based on replicate blank sample measurements with a precision 2 for both tdp and dip at 0 1 μm level tpp was measured following high temperature combustion and acid hydrolysis of the filters as described by solórzano and sharp 1980 with some improvements by zhang et al 2010 briefly the filters were wetted with 0 5 m mgcl2 solution and heated in a drying oven at 95 c until dryness and then organic p compounds were decomposed by ashing in a furnace at 550 c for 2 h the residue was extracted with 1 m hcl solution at room temperature for 24 h the sample for pip was also extracted using 1 m hcl solution at room temperature for 24 h aspila et al 1976 after neutralization and dilution both extractions of tpp and pip were quantified following the dip method concentrations of pop were obtained by subtracting pip from tpp cai et al 2008 the analytical precision for tpp and pip were 1 concentrations of spm were determined by finding the weight difference between the particulate matter retained on the dried filters and blank filters before filtration the filter samples were dried to constant weights and reweighed and the levels of spm were calculated from net dry weights and filtered water sample volumes according to lin et al 2016 and dan et al 2019 chl a was extracted in 10 ml 90 v v hplc grade acetone in the dark at 4 c for 24 h and measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4500 hitachi co japan after centrifugation parsons et al 1984 instrument calibration was done with chl a standard from spinach sigma aldrich c5753 the analytical precision for chl a was 3 yang et al 2018a 2 4 distribution coefficient the partitioning of p between dissolved and particulate phases can be quantified using the conditional distribution coefficient kd due to the proportional differences in p phases in this study the p data for the western and eastern flanks were pooled together to calculate kd in order to fully comprehend the biogeochemical behavior of p in surface water of the mws turner 1996 prastka et al 1998 lin et al 2012 the kd is given as follows 1 k d c p c d spm where cp and cd are the concentrations of particulate and dissolved p all in μm including inorganic and organic p pools respectively spm is the concentration of suspended particulate matter g ml therefore the dimension of kd is in ml g and the value of kd is expressed as log kd lin et al 2013 2 5 two end member mixing model the two end member mixing model was built on mass balance equations for salinity and the component of two water masses li et al 2017 yang et al 2018a 2 f 1 f 2 1 3 s 1 f 1 s 2 f 2 s where f 1 and f 2 represent the fractions of the freshwater and seawater end members respectively s1 and s2 represent the salinity of the two end members thus the prediction of the specific p concentration p m was based on the two end member model calculated as follows 4 p m p 1 f 1 p 2 f 2 where p 1 and p 2 are the specific p concentration of the two end members respectively the difference between the predicted value and the ambient value is defined as δp and calculated following equation below 5 δ p p m n where n is the value of the ambient phosphorus concentration in the water sample a negative δp value implies dip addition while a positive value indicates dip removal here it is important to emphasize that there are some limitations in the use of the binary mixing model in this study first the salinity of the freshwater endmember s1 does not truly represent the freshwater salinity normally this condition would have been met at the upstream regions beyond tidal reversal secondly the salinity of the saltwater end member s2 during this study see table 1 appears to be largely influenced by continuous freshwater supply and limited salt water influx from the beibu gulf to the mws thus it is possible that the near freshwater conditions i e western flank site 1 and eastern flank site 10 at the norther regions during this study summer wet season may change at other seasons when there is a reduced riverine freshwater outflow and enhanced saltwater influx apparently the lower salinity of the starting sampling sites at each flank of the mws was an average value measured during the flood and ebb tides during this study thus this allows the evaluation of the influence of riverine influx on the bioavailability of dip whereby the deviations maybe somewhat subject to some sort of non conservative processes at the western and eastern flank of the mws during the wet summer season 2 6 statistical analysis and graphing data analysis was done using the statistical program for the social science spss version 22 0 spss inc ibm armonk ny usa here one way analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate whether the difference in the mean level of the studied parameters between the western and eastern flanks was statistically significant at 95 confidence limit data normality was checked using kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk test pearson s correlation analysis with a two tailed test of significance 99 and 95 confidence interval was done to evaluate the relationship of the measured physicochemical parameters and p species plots showing the distributions of the measured parameters were produced using origin 9 0 originlab usa while the map of the study area showing the sampling sites were produced using ocean data view odv version 5 2 1 software sclitzer reiner ocean data view https odv awi de 2020 3 results 3 1 physicochemical parameters the levels and distributions of physicochemical parameters in surface water are presented in table 1 and fig s1a d salinity ranged from 0 63 to 15 07 psu at the western flank and 1 17 17 96 psu at the eastern flank and showed an obvious increasing trend from the northern to the southern regions of the mws at both blanks fig s1a ph at the western and eastern flank ranged from 7 86 8 98 average 8 28 0 43 and 7 46 8 89 average 8 10 0 49 respectively although ph showed a general decreasing trend from site 1 to site 6 and then increased to site 9 at the western flank its distributional trend at the eastern flank generally increased from the northern region to the southern region fig s1b eh ranged from 49 183 mv average 98 47 mv and 29 152 mv average 92 44 mv at the western and eastern flanks respectively suggesting that the surface water in mws was somewhat oxidative during this study fig s1c the levels of spm ranged from 34 7 to 88 3 mg l average 47 2 16 9 mg l at the western flank and 31 0 to 57 5 mg l average 41 1 10 6 mg l at the eastern flank high variability in spm was observed at the northern regions between sites 1 4 at the western flank where salinity was 5 psu but remained somewhat stable at higher salinity sites fig s1d water temperature ranged from 29 6 c 30 6 c average 29 9 0 30 c at the western flank and 30 0 c 30 3 c average 30 1 0 12 c at the eastern flank and the distributional patterns were somewhat similar to that of spm especially at the eastern flank fig s1e the level of chl a ranged from 1 95 7 95 μg l average 4 25 1 99 μg l at the western flank and 1 32 7 35 μg l average 4 59 2 21 μg l at the eastern flank the distributional patterns of chl a at the western and eastern flanks were similar showing a progressive increasing trend fig s1f as salinity increases from the northern to the southern regions of the mws do ranged from 5 52 6 44 mg l average 6 03 0 31 mg l and 5 65 6 34 mg l average 5 88 0 30 mg l at the western and eastern flanks respectively showing that the surface water in mws is well oxygenated the distributional trends decreased from the northern to the southern region of the mws at both flanks fig s1g generally there was no significant difference anova p 0 05 in the mean levels of the physicochemical parameters between the western and eastern flanks of the mws during this study 3 2 distributions of din don and dsi the concentrations and distributions of din and dsi in surface water at the western and eastern flanks of the mws are shown in table s1 fig s1h and in fig s2a b respectively there was a significant variation anova p 0 05 in the mean concentration of don with exception of din and dsi between the western and eastern flanks of the mws din ranged from 22 77 to 81 32 μm average 41 64 16 92 μm and 32 69 80 02 49 2 18 0 μm at the western and eastern flanks respectively din was the major form of tdn at both flanks fig s2c d and its concentration trend gradually decreased with an increasing salinity from the north to south in the mws fig s2a among the different din species no3 was the dominant form which singly accounted for 42 4 and 54 7 of tdn in the western and eastern flanks respectively fig s2c d don accounted for 44 7 of tdn in the western flank which was higher than average contribution 23 3 of don to tdn at the eastern flank fig s2c d although the surface water spm during this study was generally 100 mg l the elevated no3 in the mws may be related to slow nitrification process as nh4 and no2 averagely accounted for 30 of the din at both flanks during this study moreover short term localized nitrification process may have accounted for lower don concentrations compared to no3 at the eastern flank the concentrations of dsi ranged from 7 40 41 01 μm average 23 58 11 32 μm and 7 21 34 20 μm average 25 27 11 70 μm at the western and eastern flanks of the mws respectively and showed a gradually decreasing trend with increasing salinity from the northern to the southern regions of the mws fig s1h while the distribution of dsi appears to be dominantly influenced by land based sources dissolved n species tends to be influenced by both terrestrial input and biogeochemical processes within the mws similar trends have been reported in the dafengjiang river estuary in the northern beibu gulf yang et al 2018a 3 3 distributions of dissolved p and molar ratios concentrations of dip dop and tdp in the mws are presented in table 2 the distributional trends are depicted in fig 2 a b and fig 2e f no significant differences anova p 0 05 was observed in the mean level of dissolved p except for dop between the western and eastern flank of the mws dip ranged from 0 71 4 04 μm average 1 60 0 99 μm and 0 86 2 43 μm average 1 41 0 56 μm while dop ranged from 0 79 4 05 μm average 2 20 0 97 μm and 1 02 3 71 μm average 2 37 0 99 μm at the western and eastern flanks of the mws respectively generally decreasing dip concentrations with increasing salinity from the northern to the southern regions of the mws were observed at both flanks fig 2a b the average concentrations of dop at both flanks were somewhat comparable but the distributions were highly variable showing an increasing tendency as salinity increases from the north to south in the mws fig 2a b the distributions of dissolved p forms i e dip and dop in this study are consistent with the observations in jiulong river estuary lin et al 2013 the concentration of tdp ranged from 3 01 4 83 μm average 3 81 0 70 μm and 3 02 4 57 μm average 3 78 0 60 μm at the western and eastern flanks respectively at the western flank tdp had first decreased from 4 33 µm salinity 0 63 psu at site 1 to 3 01 µm salinity 1 02 psu at site 3 varied from 3 20 4 06 µm at sites 4 7 salinity 1 76 5 39 psu then increased to 4 76 µm salinity 9 00 psu and finally decreased to 3 50 µm at site 9 salinity 15 00 psu fig 2e the average concentrations of tdp at both flanks were comparable probably due to similar dop levels the levels of dip and dop in the tdp pool varied widely across the investigated sites at each flank dip and dop accounted for 14 9 83 6 average 41 9 20 2 and 16 4 85 1 average 58 1 20 2 fig 3 a and 18 8 70 4 average of 38 9 18 5 and 29 6 81 2 average 61 1 18 5 fig 3b of the tdp pool at the western and eastern flanks respectively considering the entire dataset in this study the molar din dip ratios ranged from 12 to 68 average 33 13 dsi din ratios varied from 0 16 0 96 average 0 57 0 27 while dsi dip ratios ranged from 6 26 average 17 6 fig 4 this stoichiometric relationship between din and dsi with dip have important implication for the plankton community which may also serve as an indicator for the evaluation of nutrient limitation in the mws 3 4 spatial variations of particulate inorganic and organic p the concentration and distribution of various particulate p species are presented in table 2 fig 2c d just like the dissolved p phase there was no significant variation anova p 0 05 in the mean concentration of particulate p except for pop between the western and eastern flanks of the mws the concentration of pip ranged from 0 84 3 13 μm average 1 75 0 84 μm and 0 82 1 71 μm average 1 09 0 34 μm while pop ranged from 0 42 1 16 μm average 0 76 0 27 μm and 0 28 0 73 μm average 0 49 0 17 μm at the western and eastern flanks respectively the distributional trend of pip at the western flank is similar to that at the eastern flank which showed a generally decreasing trend as salinity increases from the north to south in the mws fig 2c d slight changes were observed in the distributional trend of pip at the eastern flank at first pip showed a decreasing trend as salinity increases and then slightly increased at the higher salinity sites 14 and 15 fig 2d which also corresponded with sites where elevated spm levels were recorded at the eastern flank fig s1d pop varied minimally with no distinctive trend in its distribution patterns at both flanks fig 2c d tpp concentrations ranged from 1 45 4 13 μm average 2 51 0 98 μm and 1 23 2 37 μm average 1 59 0 41 μm and showed a gradually decreasing trend at the western flank and eastern flank respectively within the particulate p pool pip dominated the particulate p phase accounting for 68 1 9 5 and 69 1 9 1 fig 3c while pop only accounted for 31 9 9 5 and 30 9 9 1 at the western flank and eastern flank fig 3d respectively considering both dissolved and particulate p phases dissolved p was the predominant phase in the total p pool accounting for 61 1 and 70 7 while particulate p only accounted for 38 9 and 29 3 at the western flank and eastern flank fig 5 respectively as the salinity increased the increasing tdp tp ratios in the surface water were comparable to the decreasing in tpp tp ratios at the western flank fig 3e and eastern flank fig 3f suggesting a transformation of p between dissolved and particulate phases in surface water of the mws in addition the partitioning of p between dissolved and particulate phases was quantitatively evaluated using its distribution coefficient kd considering the entire dataset the p log kd values obtained for the mws ranged from 3 83 to 4 34 with an average of 4 09 0 18 fig 6 a the average p log kd in this study is slightly lower compared to values reported for other study areas such the bay of st louis 4 96 lin et al 2012 jiulong river estuary 4 57 lin et al 2013 and pearl river estuary 4 51 li et al 2017 4 discussion 4 1 dissolved inorganic and organic p status and nutrient ratios the levels of dip and dop in mws during this study in comparison with other worldwide estuaries and bays are presented in table 3 it is important to highlight here that escalated anthropogenic activities have resulted in many reported cases of aquatic environmental degradation e g zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2020a 2020b and are responsible for the alteration of the global biogeochemical cycles in recent years the effects of land use change on the remobilization of p including the rate at which inorganic fertilizer is widely used for agricultural practices in many watersheds soil erosion and local sewage discharge have significantly increased the tons of p and the frequency of algal outbreak and eutrophication in estuaries and marginal seas mackenzie et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 many estuaries and coastal water experiences occasional and or frequent algal bloom and eutrophication due to increasing human impacts in chinese coastal regions duan et al 2008 pan and wang 2012 yan et al 2012 concentrations of dip in eutrophic aquatic systems exceed 0 1 mg l 1 i e 3 2 μm and exceeds the proportions of dop in the tdp pool lemley et al 2015 examples of such eutrophic aquatic systems are the scheldt estuary van der zee et al 2007 jiulong river estuary lin et al 2013 and danshuei river estuary fang and wang 2020 table 3 where elevated dip concentrations have been heavily attributed to anthropogenic input alvarez vazquez et al 2016 however there are other eutrophic aquatic systems such as the pearl river estuary lu et al 2009 and the nile river estuary abdel satar et al 2017 where dop dominates the tdp pool although rivers and or ground waters are the main sources of terrestrial dissolved nutrients in estuaries and coastal waters studies have shown that elevated dop or don pools are also largely delivered from natural sources in coastal waters e g dan et al 2019 wang et al 2020a 2020b thus the amount and characteristics of dissolved inorganic or organic p in most estuaries and coastal marine systems may not entirely depend on anthropogenic perturbations but on autochthonous sources as well as the economic functionality of an aquatic system as shown in table 3 the concentrations of dip in the mws were lower to medium range compared to other aquatic systems in different regions while dop was generally higher than other referenced systems it is important to note that p is mostly adsorbed by soil particles and spm and the adsorption capacity may increase as the levels of fe oxyhydr oxides calcium aluminum and or organic matter increases in waters particularly the presence of fe oxyhydr oxides or biogenic apatite effectively limits the dissolution of p and its availability in the water column liu et al 2004 lower concentrations of dip in many chinese coastal waters have been attributed high adsorption on particulate matter e g liu et al 2009 moreover china is the largest mariculture producer in the world with an annual production of 17 million tons mt of seaweed and shellfish mariculture moac 2017 and mws is the largest oyster mariculture bay in southwest china therefore elevated surface water dop would be expected in most of the chinese coastal waters including mariculture bays due to biological productions although eutrophication occasionally occurs in the mws the overall contribution of dip to surface water eutrophication in the mws seems less even as anthropogenic input may have accounted for the elevated dip which exceeded the threshold for eutrophication at the western flank site 2 table 2 fig 2a in summary it is likely that the higher proportions of dop compared to dip in the mws and the difference in the concentrations of dissolved p between the mws and other aquatic systems in the literature may be attributed to different sources of p within the watershed the level of biological productivity and biogeochemical processes influencing p concentrations and dynamics generally phytoplankton growth rate can be limited by one or more essential macronutrients thus the control of primary production by nutrients has occasioned much research on the metabolic characteristics of phytoplankton in many freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems because din dip and dsi can stimulate phytoplankton blooms including harmful algal bloom species habs in coastal areas the typical redfield brzezinski molar ratios of si to n 1 1 and n to p 16 1 are used to represent nutrient stoichiometric requirements for a balanced plankton growth in both freshwater and coastal marine systems redfield 1963 brzezinski 1985 for example the abundance of dsi is an important stimulant for diatoms growth which helps in transferring energy to higher trophic levels due to higher grazing potential of higher organism such as zooplankton on diatoms conley et al 1993 this implies that non diatom plankton that may not require dsi for growth may dominate phytoplankton community if dsi is limiting and this may reduce the trophic importance of diatoms in aquatic systems based on laboratory bioassay dip may potentially limit primary productivity when the ambient molar ratios of din dip and dsi dip exceeds 22 justić et al 1995 in addition experimental study by hu et al 1990 showed that dip might be potentially limiting when din dip exceeds 30 while din limitation would occur when din dip is 8 for phytoplankton production moreover kahlert 1998 reported that dip bio limitation may occur when din dip is 32 while din bio limitation would occur if din dip is 12 for phytoplankton production during this study the mean molar din dip ratio was generally higher than the typical redfield brzezinski ratio and higher than the experimental ratios reported for din and dip limitations in the literature hu et al 1990 justić et al 1995 kahlert 1998 implying that primary productivity in the mws is strongly limited by dip although the dsi dip ratios obtained in this study were elevated the dsi din ratios were less than the typical redfield brzezinski ratios suggesting that dsi may co limit primary productivity in the mws the differences in the nutritional needs of plankton assemblages and biogeochemical processes may have accounted for the spatial variability of nutrient molar ratios as observed in this study fig 4 based on the assumption that dop in the mws is composed of lower molecular weight compounds which could be assimilated by microbial community when dip is not enough to provide the nutritional needs of living aquatic organisms the stoichiometric relationship between din and dip dop was evaluated considering the whole dataset the molar din dip dop ratios in this study ranged from 8 to 23 with an average of 12 4 this showed that dop is not limiting when scaled to the redfield brzezinski ratio implying that dop may be nutritionally important in the mws because extant microorganism community may simultaneously assimilate dop as well as dip however changes in molar ratios of the dissolved nutrients in the mws especially as dsi and dip may potentially co limit primary productivity would affect the proportions and functionality of phytoplankton community egge and aksnes 1992 conley et al 1993 therefore the findings in this study suggested that changes in nutrient ratios and dominance of din may have important implications on the algal outbreak frequently reported in the mws in recent years 4 2 relationship between p and physicochemical parameters the correlations between nutrients and surface water physicochemical parameters such as salinity ph and chl a have important implications on the sources and biogeochemical behavior of nutrients including p in coastal waters pearson correlation analysis with a two tail level of significance was conducted on p species physicochemical parameters and related nutrients contents obtained during this study from the western and eastern flanks of the mws to have an in depth understanding of the influencing factors on different p species in the mws it is important to note that modifications in nutrient concentrations occur in most coastal marine systems that are influenced by multiple stressors for instance significant negative correlation between nutrients and salinity may indicate that saltwater dilution may likely be among the most important factor affecting nutrient concentrations with the assumption that nutrients in the system of interest are dominantly derived from riverine source dan et al 2019 thus the deviation from such relationships may be attributed to other factors that either add or remove nutrients from surface water in this study the result from pearson correlation analysis showed negative relationship between different p species and salinity except for dop table 4 the generally decreasing trend of dip pip pop and tpp from the north to south in the mws fig 2a f and their positive relationship with din and dsi table 4 indicated that the surface water p is mostly delivered from the adjoining rivers to the mws this is consistent with the previous observations in the study area yang et al 2012 on the other hand p is prone to form insoluble particulate compounds through adsorption oxidation reduction complexation and co precipitation with organic matter metal oxides and or ions in aquatic environment he et al 2009 a slight increase in pip contents at the southern region of the eastern flank station 15 may have resulted from sediment resuspension during tidal mixing this may be possible as previous study had reported that sedimentary p in the mws is dominantly composed of inorganic p yang et al 2019b dan et al 2020a although surface water pop can increase via in situ marine primary production jensen et al 1995 yang et al 2018b the gradual increase in surface water pop around the southern region of the eastern flank site 14 in the mws may have also resulted from sediment resuspension in overall the relationship between tpp with spm was positive and significant r 0 52 p 0 05 while significant negative relationship was observed between tpp and chl a r 0 57 p 0 05 these imply that both the spm and primary productivity played different roles in particulate p dynamics in the mws generally dop dominated the tdp pool in the mws during this study as discussed earlier section 4 1 the ph values table 1 in the investigated sites show that alkalinity thrives in surface water of the mws increase in ph causes a shift in phosphate speciation from h2po4 to hpo4 2 and when dissolved p is present in the form of hpo4 2 in alkaline environment it would be easy for ca2 and carbonate to produce insoluble p species by co precipitation wang et al 2012 resulting in lower dip concentrations as observed in this study similar to pop dop also generally increased as chl a increased along the salinity gradients from the northern to the southern regions at the western and eastern flanks of the mws although somewhat variable the correlation between chl a and dop was positive and significant r 0 68 p 0 01 table 4 suggesting that dop is relevant for phytoplankton production in the mws dip showed a significant negative correlation with chl a r 0 52 p 0 05 table 4 which indicated that the reduction in dip in surface water of the mws was also partly related to phytoplankton utilization the average molar don dop ratio during this study was 15 7 which is almost the same as the redfield n p ratio of 16 1 required for phytoplankton balanced growth redfield 1963 dan et al 2019 this suggested that the concentrations of don and dop are optimal from plankton utilization and that the sources i e besides anthropogenic input and distribution of dop are somewhat influenced by the growth and metabolism of primary producers in surface water of the mws concentration of dop exceeding that of dip have been frequently reported in estuarine and coastal surface waters attributed to phytoplankton production enhancing the dop released into the seawater e g van beusekom and de jonge 2012 duan et al 2016 therefore primary productivity by marine plankton plays important role in the concentrations and dynamics of dop in the mws 4 3 transformation and partitioning of p between dissolved and particulate phases various p species can vary significantly in concentrations between dissolved and particulate phases along salinity gradients during mixing processes in aquatic environments and environmental mixing conditions induces p removal migration regeneration and transformation between different species lin et al 2012 particulate p is important in the cycling of p in coastal waters and can be transformed into dissolved p by the direct extracellular release from phytoplankton sloppy feeding by crustacean zooplankton and cytolysis by viral infection and release of ingested prey organic matter by protozoan grazers or desorption although the concentration trend of tpp generally decreased from sites 1 9 at the western flank our results showed a considerable increase in tdp as tpp declined at salinity range of 3 9 psu around the estuary regions at the western flank fig 2e potentially this indicated that there was desorption and release of p from particulate p phase during estuarine mixing at the western flank at the eastern flank it appeared that the reduction in tpp with the corresponding increase in tdp concentrations obviously occurred across the sampling sites where salinity ranged from 1 17 17 96 psu fig 2f generally the sharp decline in tdp in the relatively high salinity of 13 18 psu and 9 15 psu sites at the eastern and western flanks respectively fig 2e f suggesting that there was a rapid p removal behavior during later mixing this may be because fine grained particles can easily adsorb large amount of tdp by flocculation in saline water environment which settle to the sediment resulting in the decrease of tdp concentrations magni et al 2002 therefore these observations showed that the dynamic transformations of p between dissolved and particulate phase at varying salinity is possible in surface water at the western and eastern flanks of the mws at the western flank the decrease in the concentration of dip between the lower salinity 0 65 psu site 2 and higher salinity 9 35 psu site 8 was 3 33 μm and comparable to the corresponding increase in dop 3 26 μm at these sites the near balance between dip and dop at the lower and higher salinity regions showed that there is a potential transformation of p between dip and dop in surface water of the mws at the western flank along the salinity gradients at the eastern flank the decrease in dip 1 57 μm was obviously lower than the corresponding increase in dop 2 69 μm but the sum of the reduction in tpp and dip i e 2 71 μm almost balanced the increase in dop therefore increase in dop is related to fact that dip is readily assimilated by aquatic organisms and excreted in the form of dop or desorbed and released from particulate p lin et al 2013 for the eastern flank it may be that zooplankton fed on phytoplankton that utilizes large amount of dip and then metabolized to insoluble particulate p which releases lower dip to surface water as also reported in other study areas e g benitez nelson 2000 yoshimura et al 2018 previous studies have also shown that dip can be transformed biologically to dop through assimilation by marine phytoplankton and or bacteria ruttenberg 2003 this conclusion can be supported by the significantly negative correlation between dip and dop r 0 75 p 0 01 in the mws table 4 in summary a large scale migration and or transformation among p species occurred between the dissolved and particulate phases facilitated by complex biogeochemical processes during estuarine mixing at the western and eastern flanks of the mws generally a two step mechanism for adsorption of dip by particles is 1 one that proceeds via a fast reaction kinetic step through adsorption or desorption on the particles surface and 2 through the diffusion of phosphate into the interior of particles that occur in a longer time scale froelich 1988 hence if the kinetic reaction time is slower than the flushing time of an aquatic ecosystem the chemical reaction processes between dissolved and particulate p phases will not reach equilibrium morris 1990 fang 2000 therefore the non equilibrium in the dissolved and particulate p phase may be dependent on the relative time scales of adsorption or desorption processes of different p species due to the continuous inflow of freshwater from the adjoining rivers irregular diurnal tidal incursion and changes in spm concentrations induced by sediment resuspension along salinity gradients this may account for the slightly lower and wider range of p log kd values cai et al 2012 as obtained in the mws compared to other study areas caraco et al 1990 showed a decrease in p log kd values as salinity increases due to sulphate competition for adsorption sites such process promotes desorption at higher salinity in this study the p log kd decreased as salinity increases especially at the eastern flank fig 6a in addition to some factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs the decrease in p log kd may be attributed to desorption of p from the particles because of competition from seawater major anions such as cl and so4 that form soluble chloro and sulfato complexes with metals in solution a significant negative relationship was also found between the p log kd versus spm especially at the eastern flank fig 6b indicating that p has a strong particle reactivity in the mws moreover particle concentration effect may have played an important role in regulating the partitioning of inorganic p and tp between dissolved and particulate phases li et al 2017 consistent with the findings in the southwest region of lake michigan lin and guo 2016 in contrast the weak correlation between the p log kd and spm at the western flank showed that indeed several indirect processes affecting p partitioning between the dissolved and particulate phases are related to biological factors especially for dop and pop while dip and pip were mostly influenced by physicochemical factors in summary the differences in p log kd values between the mws and other coastal marine systems e g lin et al 2012 lin and guo 2016 li et al 2017 may be generally dependent on the levels and spatial distributions of salinity spm ph aerobic conditions the texture of particles adsorbed p sources of p flushing time river flow rate dissolved organic matter colloidal p content and alkalinity 4 4 effect of rivers discharge on p dynamics studies on the influence of riverine discharge on p dynamics are important for understanding the biogeochemical behavior of p as mentioned in section 2 1 the annual freshwater discharge from the maolingjiang river and qinjiang river into the mws is 25 9 108 m3 y 1 and 20 3 108 m3 y 1 respectively and these rivers also co deliver 8 6 104 tons y 1 of suspended sediment load into the mws chen et al 2018 however these amount are far less compared to the annual freshwater discharge from other chinese rivers such the pearl river discharge 3 3 1011 m3 y 1 suspended load 85 107 tons y 1 li et al 2017 and dafengjiang river discharge 18 3 109 m3 y 1 suspended load 11 77 104 tons y 1 yang et al 2018a apparently more than 80 of these discharges occur during the wet season months may september in the mws and nearby aquatic systems nevertheless the average tdp 3 84 μm and tpp 2 14 μm in the mws are significantly higher than the amount previously reported in nearby aquatic systems such as the dafengjiang river estuary tdp 1 05 μm tpp 0 19 μm yang et al 2018a and pearl river estuary tdp 1 92 μm tpp 1 50 μm li et al 2017 during the wet season the lower concentrations of surface water p in the pearl river estuary were reported to be significantly influenced by strong stratification which had favored the settlement of spm supplied by freshwater discharge and thus enhancing more dip uptake for primary productivity li et al 2017 on the other hand lower surface water p phases in the dafengjiang river estuary were attributed to lower p export by the rivers and less anthropogenic p input yang et al 2018a moreover the reduction in surface water p in the dafengjiang river estuary surface water also resulted from rapid water exchange between the dafengjiang river estuary and the beibu gulf compared to the nearby aquatic systems with high freshwater discharge rates it is most likely that differences in dissolved p relative to particulate p in the mws may result from differences in biogeochemical and physical processes among all p species in dissolved and particulate phases dip is the most readily bioavailable for primary productivity in surface water and the continuous freshwater supply limited water exchange between the mws and the beibu gulf and primary productivity may have had an important implication on the concentrations and distributions of dip in the mws thus we applied a two end member mixing model to distinguish the influences of the physical or biological factors on dip variability in the mws at the western flank the freshwater and saltwater end members for surface water salinity and dip concentrations were 0 63 psu and 1 88 μm and 15 07 psu and 1 33 μm selected from sites 1 and 9 respectively tables 1 and 2 at the eastern flank the freshwater and saltwater end members for surface water salinity and dip concentrations were 1 17 psu and 2 43 μm and 17 96 psu and 0 91 μm selected from sites 10 and 15 respectively tables 1 and 2 as shown in fig 6c and the deviation from the theoretical mixing line positive deviations were found at most of the stations except for the negative deviation at site 2 for the western flank fig 6d the positive deviation suggested that dip variability at the western and eastern flanks of the mws is also dominantly controlled by biological utilization in addition to absorption desorption processes dip addition was observed near the mouth of the maolingjiang river estuary where industries are clustered zhang et al 2019 which likely contributed to the replenishment of dip from the perennial industrial sewage discharge from our data we found that the reduction in dip was 1 24 μm and 1 55 μm at the western and eastern flanks respectively as estimated by the two end member model thus it is likely that the bioavailability of dip for phytoplankton uptake is somewhat higher at the eastern flank supported by the relatively higher average chl a than at the western flank of the mws therefore multiple biogeochemical processes control the dynamics of p under the influence of riverine input in surface water of the mws 5 conclusion this study focused on the p biogeochemistry in dissolved and particulate phases in surface water at the western and eastern flanks of the maowei sea mws total dissolved p tdp dominated tdp tp 61 2 70 6 the total p tp pool dissolved organic p dop dominated dop tdp 58 1 61 1 the tdp pool in contrast to dissolved p phase the total particulate p tpp pool was dominated by inorganic p pip which accounted for 68 1 69 1 of tpp the dominance of tdp pool indicated that the delivery of p from rivers to coastal sea in dissolved phase is as important as particulate phase especially in less turbid aquatic systems dip level in the mws is lower to medium range compared to other estuarine and coastal systems while dop is somewhat elevated in the mws due to the prevailing intensive mariculture in the mws biological production and or dissolution from fecal debris and detritus increasing anthropogenic sources from the catchment and or watershed may also have accounted for the increase in the levels of dip or dop the readily bioavailable p species which may worsen the frequency of eutrophication depending on how the mws would respond to external p load the stoichiometric relationship between dip din and dsi suggested that dip is potentially bio limiting in the mws while dsi may co limit plankton growth the dynamic changes transformation and distribution of p in dissolved and particulate phases are controlled by physicochemical conditions freshwater discharge and biological activities in the mws a partitioning coefficient kd approach which was used to examine the partitioning of p and its particle reactivity showed that particle concentration effect along the salinity gradients contributed to the partitioning of p between the dissolved and particulate phase although subject to some limitations the two end member mixing model suggested that dip was also influenced by biological factors such as phytoplankton uptake in most of the studied sites overall the study on the dynamic changes in the concentrations spatial distribution and transformation process of different p species between dissolved and particulate phases can effectively reveal the biogeochemical behavior of p as well as understanding the internal relationship between the biogeochemical cycling of p and eutrophication

4926,erosion rates in streams vary dramatically over time as differences in streamflow and sediment load enhance or inhibit erosion processes within cave streams and other bedrock channels incising soluble rocks changes in water chemistry are an important factor in determining how erosion rates will vary in both time and space prior studies in surface streams springs and caves suggest that variation in dissolved co 2 is the strongest control on variation in calcite dissolution rates however the controls on co 2 variation remain poorly quantified limited data suggest that ventilation of karst systems can substantially influence dissolved co 2 within karst conduits however the interactions among cave ventilation air water co 2 exchange and dissolution dynamics have not been studied in detail in this study three years of time series measurements of dissolved and gaseous co 2 cave airflow velocity and specific conductance from blowing springs cave arkansas were analyzed and used to estimate continuous calcite dissolution rates and quantify the correlations between those rates and potential physical and chemical drivers we find that chimney effect airflow creates temperature driven switches in airflow direction and that the resulting seasonal changes in airflow regulate both gaseous and dissolved co 2 within the cave as in previous studies partial pressure of co 2 pco 2 is the strongest chemical control of dissolution rate variability however we also show that cave airflow direction rather than streamflow is the strongest physical driver of changes in dissolution rate contrary to the typical situation in surface channel erosion where floods largely determine the timing and extent of geomorphic work at the study site chemical erosion is typically active in the summer during periods of cave downdraft airflow from upper to lower entrances and inactive in the winter during updraft airflow from lower to upper entrances storms provide only minor perturbations to this overall pattern we also find that airflow direction modulates dissolution rate variation during storms with higher storm variability during updraft than during downdraft finally we compare our results with the limited set of other studies that have examined dissolution rate variation within cave streams and draw an initial hypothesis that evolution of cave ventilation patterns strongly impacts how dissolution rate dynamics evolve over the lifetime of karst conduits keywords karst bedrock channel cave ventilation carbon dioxide dissolution 1 introduction the variation in geomorphic rates has an important influence on the relationship between erosional processes and the landforms that they produce wolman and miller 1960 whereas concepts of the magnitude and frequency of geomorphic work have long been explored in the study of processes on earth s surface fewer studies have examined the variability in rates of cave development or the factors that control this variation groves and meiman 2005 cave passages are often developed by subsurface streams incising through bedrock since many cave streams carry substantial sediment loads farrant and smart 2011 mechanical erosion processes such as occur within surface bedrock channels whipple et al 2000 undoubtedly are active within these streams however most caves develop in karst settings within highly soluble rocks where chemical dissolution of the rock is an important driver of channel development and evolution ford and williams 2007 palmer 2007a a number of studies have measured solute export from basins and used these data to examine how rates of chemical denudation vary with streamflow wolman and miller 1960 gunn 1982 schmidt 1985 goudie and viles 1999 these studies conclude that low to moderate flows produce an important percentage of the overall chemical geomorphic work at the basin scale however rates of channel incision by dissolution and basin wide chemical denudation do not in general display the same relationship to streamflow groves and meiman 2005 show that in the logsdon river passage of mammoth cave kentucky conduit wall dissolution rates are a strong function of discharge with 87 of the work being done during high discharges that occur less than 5 of the time in contrast they find that solute export is important across a range of discharges with only 38 of the export occurring during the highest discharge class palmer 2007b finds a similar relationship between discharge and calcite dissolution rate in mcfail s cave new york analysis of water chemistry data from streams across the united states suggests that variability in calcite dissolution rates at most sites is more strongly correlated with variability in dissolved co 2 than with streamflow and that in channel dissolution rates are often much higher than estimates of basin wide denudation rates covington et al 2015 covington and vaughn 2019 show that seasonal variability in co 2 is the primary driver for variation in calcite dissolution rates at a pair of karst underflow overflow springs additionally they hypothesize that during low flows ventilation within the conduit feeding the overflow spring drives a reduction in co 2 and consequently dissolution rates in general previous investigators have argued that cave ventilation which often occurs in the later stages of cave development may reduce the rates of chemical erosion within cave streams as caves becomes more mature palmer 2007b while it is clear that both floods and co 2 dynamics are important drivers of dissolution rate variability within cave streams there are relatively few cave sites where dissolution rate variability has been quantified groves and meiman 2005 palmer 2007b covington and vaughn 2019 this lack of data limits the ability to generalize about the controls on calcite dissolution rate variability here we analyze water chemistry data in a cave stream in the ozark plateaus physiographic region of arkansas to explore potential controls of dissolution rate variability we use recently developed techniques for direct high temporal resolution measurements of dissolved co 2 johnson et al 2010 combined with time series of specific conductance spc to estimate calcite dissolution rates over a three year period these measurements are complemented by simultaneous measurements of cave air co 2 and cave airflow velocity this enables us to explore interactions between cave atmosphere dynamics and cave stream chemistry 2 description of field site blowing springs cave is located in bella vista arkansas within the springfield plateau region of the ozark plateaus fig 1 the cave is developed in the cherty mississippian boone limestone primarily within the st joe limestone member mcfarland 1998 because of a high concentration of chert and clay impurities the boone limestone develops a mantled karst where a thick regolith composed of chert and clay covers the karst surface brahana 2011 within the region surrounding the cave the boone limestone spans the topography from valley floors to ridges the cave therefore is autogenically recharged through a regolith cover because of the regolith cover the region contains few obvious surface karst features such as sinkholes though most of the valleys located in the recharge area are dry except during periods of intense precipitation the land cover in the recharge area is a mixture of deciduous forest and low intensity residential the region has a temperate continental climate with a mean annual air temperature of approximately 15 c adamski et al 1995 and a mean annual precipitation of about 114 cm per year cm yr pugh and westerman 2014 blowing springs cave contains 2 397 meters m of mapped cave passage and consists of a dendritic stream network fig 1 water enters the main cave stream through a number of small infeeding channels and through many percolating fractures within the cave ceiling though the largest source of discharge to the cave stream is the upstream sump many of the cave passages are oriented along an orthogonal set of ne sw and nw se trending fractures the only known entrance of the cave is at the spring and as the name suggests the cave exhibits strong airflow with air blowing out of the spring entrance during times of warm outside temperatures the spring emerges near the elevation of the local base level stream which is little sugar creek 3 methods 3 1 collection of time series data time series data of water quality and cave atmospheric parameters were collected at a site located approximately 150 m inside the cave entrance which is labeled as cave measurement station in fig 1 cave airflow velocity cave air barometric pressure and co 2 concentrations in the cave air and water were logged on a campbell scientifictmcr850 datalogger cave airflow velocity and direction were measured using a campbell scientific windsonic1 2d ultrasonic anemometer resolution 0 01 m s accuracy 2 at 12 m s directional accuracy 3 barometric pressure was measured using a campbell scientifictmcs100 sensor accuracy 0 5 hpa co 2 concentrations in the air and water were measured using vaisala gmm220 co 2 transmitters with a range of 0 to 5 000 ppm ppm accuracy 1 5 of range 2 of reading the co 2 sensors were protected from moisture with a waterproof breathable membrane ptfe as described in johnson et al 2010 one sensor was exposed to the cave air and the other was submerged in the cave stream to enable direct measurement of the partial pressure of co 2 pco 2 of the water this setup provides a more reliable means of recording pco 2 than continuous measurement of ph as the co 2 sensors exhibit much less drift over time than ph electrodes johnson et al 2010 covington and vaughn 2019 for the co 2 sensors a warm up period of 15 min was used before a measurement was taken this warm up period allowed thermal equilibration of the sensor and helped to drive any moisture out of the sensor optics we found that this warm up period was crucial as substantial instrument drift occurred within the first few minutes of power up measured values of pco 2 were not adjusted with water depth as described by johnson et al 2010 because subsequent theoretical analysis and experiments have shown that this adjustment is incorrect blackstock et al 2019 co 2 readings were taken once an hour to conserve power whereas other parameters recorded on the cr850 were read on a one minute interval in this study all co 2 concentrations are reported in ppm which are nominally values of ppm volume ppmv within a gas phase where the concentrations for our dissolved measurements are within a headspace equilibrated to the dissolved phase air and water values are reported in the same units to enable direct comparison and we use ppm as these are the units typically employed in cave atmospheric studies while the instrument reports ppmv it actually directly measures molecular density concentrations in ppmv must be corrected both for pressure and temperature we are specifically interested in pco 2 which can be more directly calculated from molecular density than can ppmv only requiring a temperature correction and the factory calibration pressure blackstock et al 2019 which we assume to be 1 atm we apply the temperature correction and then 1 ppm is equivalent to a pco 2 of 10 6 atm therefore our reported ppm values are directly proportional to pco 2 and can be thought of as a type of pco 2 value albeit with unusual units the specific conductance spc and temperature of the cave stream were measured at the same site as co 2 on a time interval of 5 min using an onset hobotmu24 001 freshwater conductivity logger with an accuracy of 3 or 5 microsiemens per centimeter μ s cm outside of the cave air temperature and relative humidity were measured at a 5 min interval using an onset hobotmu23 001 temperature accuracy 0 21 c and relative humidity accuracy 2 5 logger that was mounted onto a tree to provide a proxy for stable cave temperature we deployed an onset hobotmu20l 04 pressure and temperature logger in the cave air approximately 400 m inside the cave accuracy 0 44 c unless specified otherwise all data presented here are hourly averages to align with the frequency of co 2 measurements the site within the cave was visited roughly every four weeks which was the approximate duration of the battery power supply two 12 volt 20 amp hour lithium ion batteries during each site visit batteries were changed data downloaded and quality control on site measurements were made of specific conductance water temperature and co 2 concentrations in the air and water to make on site measurements of co 2 a portable vaisala gmm220 was used that was connected to a battery and data logger spot measurements of co 2 in the water required a roughly 30 min equilibration period for gas concentrations to exchange across the ptfe membrane whereas a partial record of stage and estimated discharge is available at the spring frequent human disturbances of the stream channel near the weir the site is located in a park reduced the quality of the available dataset rather than using this corrupted record we employ a modification of an estimation of discharge at blowing springs cave developed by knierim et al 2015 using the nearby united states geological survey usgs streamflow gaging station on little sugar creek usgs station no 07188838 little sugar creek near pineville missouri with data available from the usgs national water information system u s geological survey 2020 knierim et al 2015 found that a linear regression provided a reasonable approximation of discharge at blowing springs however they also noted that blowing springs exhibited a minimum baseflow discharge and therefore they introduced a threshold minimum value to remove the sharp threshold and reduce errors on moderate discharge values we introduce a new regression to daily averaged discharges using a sigmoidal function in log space fig 2 1 log q bsc a 1 exp d log q lsc b c where q bsc is the discharge at blowing springs in m 3 s and q lsc is the streamflow in little sugar creek and the best fit values of the fitting parameters are a 1 99 b 1 14 c 2 07 and d 3 24 the root mean squared percentage error rmspe in this model is 33 the sigmoidal shape nicely captures the transition to baseflow and also captures a possible rolloff at high discharges 1 2 m 3 s that is evident in the 15 min data many karst springs do exhibit maximum discharges bonacci 2001 though this upper rolloff also has limited impact on our estimates due to the small number of data points that fall at these highest discharges most of our results are independent of this discharge estimate which is primarily used to indicate the occurrence and frequency of high and low flow periods to examine how dissolution rate varies with flow the precise magnitudes of discharge are not necessary for interpreting our data 3 2 calculation of dissolution rates in order to calculate dissolution rates from available kinetic rate equations we need values for the dissolved ca concentration and the pco 2 while we measure pco 2 directly ca concentrations were estimated from spc time series collected at the site as has also been done in prior studies of dissolution rate dynamics within karst systems groves and meiman 2005 covington and vaughn 2019 and is appropriate where water is predominantly ca hco 3 type to estimate ca we use a linear regression on available spc and ca data n 109 from a prior study at blowing springs cave knierim et al 2017 we find that ca 0 175 spc 2 51 where ca is concentration in mg l the rmspe of this relationship is 10 however uncertainties are larger for lower spc values therefore for error propagation purposes we divide the data into quartiles and use separate uncertainty values for each quartile these uncertainties range from 4 5 to 13 7 these data and further details on error estimation can be found in the data repository described in the data availability section of this paper to calculate dissolution rates from ca and pco 2 time series we use two available calcite kinetic equations which we refer to as the pwp plummer et al 1978 and palmer equations palmer 1991 both equations are derived from the same experimental dataset but the palmer equation is a direct fit to the data whereas the pwp equation incorporates a more mechanistic approach to parameter estimation the palmer equation generates a closer fit to the observed dissolution rates near saturation and also provides parameter values for impure calcite which is more appropriate for limestone covington and vaughn 2019 found that the palmer equation provided much closer estimates of mass loss rates of limestone tablets deployed in the field and therefore it is likely that these rates are more accurate in natural settings the pwp equation sometimes produces negative rates which might suggest calcite precipitation however calcite precipitation normally does not occur until waters are highly supersaturated therefore negative pwp rates are not necessarily indicative of precipitation in time series of dissolution rates we show both the pwp and palmer equations however when studying sensitivity of rates to various potential controls it is helpful to have a broader range of values including a range of negative values that represent different extents of supersaturation therefore we use pwp rates to explore controls on variability even though the magnitude of the rates is likely too high covington and vaughn 2019 rates predicted by both equations typically vary monotonically with one another both dissolution rate equations were calculated using algorithms in the olm python package v0 36 covington et al 2015 which is available on github https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 4030690 uncertainties in dissolution rates were estimated using monte carlo error propagation of uncertainties in ca and pco 2 4 results 4 1 large scale patterns in the time series data the water chemistry and cave atmosphere parameters were recorded over a period of approximately three years oct 2014 jan 2018 co 2 concentrations in air and water range between near atmospheric concentration 500 ppm to above 5 000 ppm fig 3 a for a few short periods pco 2 in the water exceeded the measurement range of the sensor deployed 5 500 ppm concentrations in the water almost always exceeded those in the air both dissolved and gaseous co 2 concentrations within the cave showed seasonal patterns with higher concentrations in summer and lower concentrations during winter gaseous co 2 within the cave dropped near atmospheric values for much of the winter dissolved co 2 often exhibited spikes to higher values associated with high discharge events gaseous co 2 displayed strong diurnal variability during certain periods particularly during the spring and fall these periods of variability are associated with times when outside air temperatures are near those of the cave air temperature which is approximately the mean surface air temperature badino 2010 cave airflow velocity also had a seasonal pattern with outward positive airflow during warm periods and inward negative airflow during cold periods fig 3b there was diurnal variability in airflow velocity particularly during spring and fall periods with some days exhibiting both inward and outward airflow at different times of day again these periods of high variability are times when outside temperatures are near the temperature of the cave atmosphere specific conductance displayed a range from 65 to 265 μ s cm variability in spc was more strongly related to discharge than to season figs 3c d spc was high during periods of low flow and low during periods of high flow particularly flood events all records display gaps that are associated with sensor or power failures however the spc record is the least complete with a large number of gaps resulting from sensor failure damage during storms or download failure which lead to memory filling on the datalogger before the next opportunity to download as can be seen visually in fig 3c d there is a strong correlation between specific conductance and stream discharge q the relationship between these parameters is explicitly displayed in fig 4 along with a 4th order polynomial regression between log q and specific conductance given by 2 spc ax 4 bx 3 cx 2 d where x log q a 48 6 b 296 2 c 639 4 and d 649 2 the coefficients were determined using the polyfit function from the numpy package in python because of the large number of gaps and the strong relationship between discharge and spc the daily estimated spc using eq 2 is shown in fig 3c the root mean squared error rmse in estimated spc is 14 9 μ s cm the valid discharge range for the fit is from approximately 10 l s to 1 000 l s during periods where spc data were lacking we estimate ca from these modeled values to account for additional uncertainty introduced by this step we divide these data into 10 percentile based bins of discharge and calculate the rmse for each of these bins we use gaussian error propagation to convert these uncertainties in spc into uncertainties in ca which are used in the monte carlo error propagation for the dissolution rate calculations 4 2 relationship between cave airflow and external air temperature the seasonal and diurnal patterns in cave airflow velocity suggest a relationship between outside air temperature and cave airflow as would be expected in the case of chimney effect airflow wigley et al 1976 luetscher et al 2008 badino 2010 covington and perne 2015 chimney effect airflow is an airflow mechanism driven by density contrasts between the cave air and outside air and occurs within cave systems with more than one opening to the outside during periods of warm outside temperatures cave air is more dense than outside air and it is therefore pushed from upper entrances to lower entrances during cold outside temperatures cave air is less dense than outside air and rises from lower entrances to upper entrances note that such airflow does not require human sized entrances or large elevation differences millimeter scale fracture apertures and decimeters of elevation difference are sufficient covington 2016 the pressure difference δ p that drives chimney effect airflow can be approximated using cf badino 2010 3 δ p ρ in gh δ t t ext where ρ in is the density of the air inside the cave g is earth s gravitational acceleration h is the height difference between the two entrances δ t is the difference between cave and external temperature and t ext is the external air temperature in kelvin chimney effect airflow is typically turbulent and therefore the darcy weisbach equation for flow of fluid in a pipe provides a reasonable approximation luetscher and jeannin 2004 for airflow velocity v with 4 v 2 d h δ p ρ in fl where d h is the hydraulic diameter of the flow path f is the darcy weisbach friction factor and l is the length of the flow path combining these two equations leads to 5 v 2 d h gh δ t flt ext where one can see that the airflow velocity is predicted to scale with the square root of the temperature difference between outside and cave air to test the plausibility of chimney effect airflow as the primary mechanism behind the observed airflow in blowing springs cave airflow velocity is plotted against the temperature difference between inside and outside air and a square root relationship is fit to the data fig 5 not only is there a strong relationship between temperature difference and cave airflow velocity but the shape of the relationship is closely matched by a square root function v r δ t 1 2 where the best fit value of the resistance factor r 0 18 there are no known human sized upper entrances to blowing springs cave however we can use knowledge of the cave system to estimate appropriate values of unknown parameters in eq 5 using l 1 000 m which is the approximate distance from the entrance to the upstream sump and h 25 m which is the approximate elevation difference between the spring entrance and the valleys feeding the cave that are likely to hold upper entrances using values of g 9 8 m s 2 and f 0 05 which is a typical value for a rough pipe and high reynolds number larock et al 2000 we can estimate that the hydraulic diameter would have to be approximately equal to 1 m in order to produce the observed value of r though diameters of the mapped portion of the cave are highly variable fig 1 with values reaching up to 5 10 m within larger rooms a diameter of 1 m is roughly consistent with observed diameters in much of the cave the untraversable upper portions of the flow paths must also be substantially smaller because they are too small for a human to enter to make the link between airflow direction and the chimney effect mechanism explicit in our further discussion from this point on we will refer to cave airflow direction as either updraft or downdraft fig 6 updraft occurs during periods when the cave air is less dense than outside air e g winter and air flows from lower to upper entrances inward downdraft occurs when the cave air is denser than outside air e g summer and air flows from upper to lower entrances outward because the airflow velocity was measured near a lower entrance updraft corresponds to inward airflow negative velocity and downdraft corresponds to outward airflow positive velocity for the study period the cave exhibited nearly continuous downdraft from june 1 to october 1 and relatively consistent updraft from december 1 to march 1 with occasional winter reversals during warm periods the spring and fall seasons exhibit frequent switching between updraft and downdraft often diurnally 4 3 relationship between airflow velocity and co 2 the seasonal patterns in cave airflow and co 2 in the air and water are well aligned fig 3 additionally there are strong relationships between co 2 and cave airflow on short timescales fig 7 during periods of diurnal airflow reversals co 2 in the cave air also shows daily peaks and troughs when airflow direction switches from downdraft to updraft cave air co 2 drops suddenly to concentrations near atmospheric 500 ppm as outside air is quickly brought to the location of the sensor when airflow switches from updraft to downdraft cave air co 2 rises somewhat more slowly likely as a result of mixing of high and low co 2 air within the cave atmosphere dissolved co 2 within the cave stream does not respond as rapidly to airflow reversals as the cave air however the cave stream co 2 does have a muted response that has a lag of a few days fig 7 dissolved and gaseous co 2 both display statistically significant correlations p value 0 0001 with airflow velocity when averaged over daily or weekly timescales fig 8 here we quantify correlation using spearman s rank correlation coefficient because the relationships are non linear helsel and hirsch 2002 correlations are stronger over the weekly timescales than the daily timescales particularly for dissolved co 2 the gaseous co 2 concentrations display a clear threshold near zero airflow velocity fig 8 which divides time periods with updraft and downdraft during periods of updraft the cave air co 2 is typically near outside atmospheric concentrations whereas during downdraft concentrations substantially increase above atmospheric values the relationship between dissolved co 2 and cave airflow does not display a clear threshold at zero cave airflow but still has a clear pattern of lower concentrations during updraft and higher concentrations during downdraft fig 8 4 4 dissolution rate dynamics in the cave stream the dissolution rates show a strong seasonal signal that is in phase with the seasonal co 2 variation fig 9 that is there are higher rates of dissolution during the summer months when pco 2 is also high and the water is undersaturated with respect to calcite lower rates of dissolution occur during the winter months frequently negative pwp rates when pco 2 is low and the water is typically supersaturated the average of this seasonal signal is near calcite saturation or zero dissolution rate but the stream spends slightly more time in the undersaturated condition when dissolution is active in addition to the seasonal signal there is clear variability on daily to weekly timescales to study the chemical controls on dissolution rate variation dissolution rates averaged over daily timescales are plotted versus the two primary chemical drivers fig 10 dissolved co 2 and a proxy for dissolved load spc to quantify the correlations between the chemical drivers and dissolution rate we calculated spearman s rank correlation coefficients both chemical drivers correlate with dissolution rates p value 0 0001 but co 2 is more strongly correlated ρ 0 80 than spc ρ 0 44 the cloud of points in the dissolution rate co 2 plot fig 10a shows a relatively sharp edge at low dissolution rate this edge is a result of baseflow conditions where spc displays a typical value of about 220 μ s cm in addition to direct chemical drivers dissolution rates vary as a function of external physical controls that produce variations in those chemical drivers the two most important physical controls on chemical variation at the site are cave airflow velocity and stream discharge cave airflow and particularly its direction is an important driver of dissolved co 2 figs 6 and 8 discharge may produce variation in both dissolved load and dissolved co 2 either through dilution during storm event runoff or alteration of water sources and flowpaths fig 11 shows the relationships between dissolution rate and these two physical drivers over a variety of timescales from daily a b to weekly c d to monthly e f generally when airflow velocity is positive downdraft and discharge is high dissolution rate is high at all timescales cave airflow displays a stronger correlation with dissolution rate than discharge though at the daily timescale the correlations are effectively the same the strength of the correlation between airflow velocity and dissolution rate increases with the duration of the averaging correlation with discharge is similar for daily and weekly timescales and somewhat higher over the monthly timescale all correlations have p values 0 0001 error is known to attenuate correlation spearman 1904 such that large errors will result in bias toward lower correlation as a result true correlations are likely modestly higher than the estimates here particularly for the daily timescale where uncertainties are largest however even for the daily timescale the measured natural variations are substantially larger than the estimated uncertainties since cave airflow velocity emerges as the strongest external driver of dissolution rate variability and because airflow direction is likely to be the most important factor in determining co 2 concentrations we divide the record into days when airflow is on average updraft winter regime and downdraft summer regime dissolution rates are higher during periods of downdraft when the cave air has higher co 2 fig 12 interestingly there is also a strong contrast in the variability of dissolution rates during the two airflow regimes with periods of updraft having much larger variability in rates this effect is further considered below as we examine how dissolution rates vary during storms 4 5 dissolution rate variation during storms to explore how dissolution rates vary during storms we first examine relationships between dissolved co 2 and discharge because co 2 is the chemical parameter most strongly correlated with changes in dissolution rate fig 10 since dissolution rates show more variability during upward airflow one hypothesis might be that airflow direction somehow modulates the variability caused by changes in discharge as an initial test of this hypothesis we examine the relationship between daily averaged values of dissolved co 2 and discharge separated into groups of downdraft and updraft conditions fig 13 dissolved co 2 is correlated with discharge during periods of updraft ρ 0 31 p value 0 0001 whereas there is no statistically significant correlation between dissolved co 2 and discharge during periods of downdraft airflow ρ 0 05 p value 0 38 again due to uncertainties in discharge and resulting attenuation of correlation the real correlations are likely modestly larger than these estimates however since the separation in ρ and p values is quite large we do not expect this to influence the general pattern to further examine the possibility that airflow modulates discharge driven dissolution rate variation during storms we plot time series of chemistry and estimated dissolution rates during storm events two typical examples are shown in fig 14 one during downdraft summer conditions and one during updraft winter conditions the winter storm produces more variation in dissolved co 2 which ranges from about 1 000 ppm to 3 500 ppm gaseous co 2 remains low during most of the event because of the dominance of updraft conditions which bring outside air quickly to the sensor location from the cave entrance spc varies from near maximal values about 220 μ s cm to 115 μ s cm driven by both changes in co 2 and dissolved load the dissolution rate changes sharply during the storm from supersaturated conditions 0 25 mm yr before the storm to highly undersaturated conditions 1 2 mm yr near the peak of the event during the winter storm estimated discharge ranged from 30 l s to 330 l s during the summer storm downdraft conditions prevail and consequently co 2 concentrations in the air remain relatively high at about 3 000 ppm except for during two brief periods of airflow reversal that follow the storm dissolved co 2 is already high 4 000 ppm before the start of the event and peaks about 5 000 ppm during the event therefore there is much less variability of dissolved co 2 during the summer storm than during the winter storm spc decreases during the storm from about 255 μ s cm to about 220 μ s cm displaying less variability than during the winter storm dissolution rate also displays less variability with rates about 0 5 mm yr before the storm and 0 8 mm yr at the peak during the summer storm estimated discharge ranged from 8 4 l s to 80 l s in general winter and spring periods of mostly updraft have higher average values of discharge fig 3 as might be expected from lower rates of evapotranspiration during these cooler periods therefore one possibility is that the correlation between airflow direction and dissolution rate variability fig 12 is spurious and is actually driven by differences in discharge dynamics during these seasons because discharge has a strong negative correlation to dissolved load fig 4 storms with greater discharge variation should also have greater variation in dissolved ca and this could drive greater variation in dissolution rate to explore this possibility we identify all storm events and calculate the range of dissolution rate the average airflow velocity and the range of discharge during each storm over the period of record the beginnings of storms were defined as increases in discharge of at least a factor of two within a period of less than two days the end of a storm event was defined to be a return to 130 of the pre storm discharge or one week after the increase in discharge whichever was shorter because most of the chemical variation occurs during the rising limb the dissolution rate ranges are not particularly sensitive to the criteria for the end of a storm event however including these criteria enables treatment of multi peak events as a single storm we find that change in dissolution rate within a storm was much more strongly correlated to mean cave air velocity during the storm ρ 0 85 p value 0 0004 than it was to the magnitude of the change in discharge ρ 0 23 p value 0 45 as is shown in fig 15 for the storm events for which complete chemical records exist this suggests that cave airflow direction is an important control on dissolution rate variation during storms and that storm dissolution rate variability is not primarily driven by dilution 5 discussion 5 1 controls of dissolution rate variability the concept of the magnitude and frequency of erosional forces is central to understanding how temporal variations in the rates of geomorphic processes influence the long term rates of landscape evolution and the morphologies that develop wolman and miller 1960 this concept is most frequently applied in fluvial systems where frequency relates to the recurrence interval of streamflows of different magnitude however magnitude and frequency have also been discussed in the context of weathering processes such as chemical solution goudie and viles 1999 a variety of studies have quantified variation in rates of chemical geomorphic work at the basin scale by examining the rate of solute export as a function of river streamflow wolman and miller 1960 gunn 1982 schmidt 1985 however quantifying magnitude and frequency within the context of weathering presents some challenges and particularly one must be clear as to the specific process that one is attempting to quantify goudie and viles 1999 calculating chemical weathering rates using river solutes provides a quantification of the magnitude and frequency attributes of solute export from a basin however since solutes are stored within the basin for some unknown time these rates are removed from the rates of actual detachment of the ions from mineral surfaces for example covington et al 2015 show that in stream calcite dissolution rates may be orders of magnitude higher than basin wide denudation rates derived from basin solute export one can imagine similarly that the time variability of rates of dissolution on karst landscape surfaces might be quite different than the time variability in basin wide solute export rates relatively few studies have attempted to quantify the time variation of calcite dissolution rates within karst streams or caves or to understand the controls of this variability groves and meiman 2005 palmer 2007b galdenzi 2012 covington et al 2015 covington and vaughn 2019 the central goal of this study was to examine variability in dissolution rates within a specific cave stream and to develop a mechanistic understanding of the controls on that variability as in previous studies groves and meiman 2005 covington et al 2015 covington and vaughn 2019 we find that the strongest chemical driver of variation in dissolution rates is variation in dissolved co 2 which shows much stronger correlation with dissolution rate at our site than does dissolved load fig 10 in turn dissolved co 2 displays a strong seasonal pattern this seasonal pattern is strongly correlated with seasonal changes in the cave air co 2 that are driven by the direction of cave airflow figs 3a b and 8 which is ultimately controlled by the temperature difference between cave air and outside air eq 5 a conceptual sketch of the interactions between these processes is shown in fig 6 review of time series data over shorter timescales days to weeks provides even stronger evidence for a mechanistic connection between cave airflow and dissolved co 2 where switches in airflow direction strongly perturb co 2 concentrations in the cave atmosphere and the dissolved co 2 in the cave stream responds in a lagged and muted fashion decreasing during periods of low cave air co 2 and increasing during periods of high cave air co 2 fig 7 review of the entire dataset shows that perhaps surprisingly dissolution rate is more strongly correlated with cave airflow velocity than with discharge fig 11 the difference in the correlation strength increases moving from daily to monthly timescales suggesting that cave airflow is most important in impacting the seasonal pattern though still has a strong impact on the timescales of storms similar observations have been made on the impact of cave ventilation on the saturation state of drip water and resulting seasonal biases within speleothem records spötl et al 2005 banner et al 2007 wong et al 2011 and ventilation has also previously been argued to impact spatial or temporal changes in cave stream dissolved co 2 or dissolved load troester and white 1984 jeannin et al 2017 gulley et al 2014 also found that seasonal cave ventilation patterns can explain seasonal changes to dissolved load and dissolved co 2 within a water table cave in florida therefore the patterns observed here cohere with previous studies though our data provide much higher time resolution to examine the connections between ventilation and cave stream saturation state in more detail though the time series data suggest that cave airflow direction is an important control of the seasonal oscillation of dissolved co 2 there may be additional drivers specifically co 2 production in the soil through microbial decay and root respiration is known to vary with surface temperature and solar radiation hibbard et al 2005 lloyd and taylor 1994 at a nearby site with a similar hydrogeological setting covington and vaughn 2019 observed a strong seasonal signal range 20 000 ppm in dissolved co 2 at langle spring arkansas which is thought to drain an unventilated portion of the karst aquifer they hypothesized that this signal derived from seasonal changes in subsurface co 2 production it is uncertain how much of the seasonal signal in dissolved co 2 at blowing springs might also be a function of changes in the rate of co 2 production in contrast to the seasonal respiration driven pattern some karst aquifers that exhibit higher pco 2 at depth than in the soil have very little seasonal co 2 variation at depth atkinson 1977a a prior study at blowing springs cave measured soil co 2 concentrations with summer values frequently being above what we observe in the cave stream and winter values frequently being below knierim et al 2017 additionally the study used stable carbon isotopes to quantify the mixture of atmospheric co 2 versus unsaturated zone co 2 produced via respiration decomposition in the cave atmosphere knierim et al 2017 found that the proportion varied seasonally and additionally that there were different mixing lines for each season highlighting seasonally variable unsaturated zone co 2 sources at the least these observations suggest that there is some storage of co 2 in the unsaturated zone that might reduce seasonal variation in the cave the few available on site measurements of dissolved co 2 at the upstream sump in blowing springs cave indicate a range of approximately 1 500 ppm between summer and winter measurements young 2018 in contrast to the range of approximately 5 000 ppm that we observe near the downstream end of the cave however it is also unclear how much ventilation might occur within the portion of the aquifer that is upstream of the sump therefore whereas there is a clear impact of cave ventilation on the annual co 2 cycle there may also be a seasonal signal driven by production the magnitude of that production signal is uncertain the mechanistic link between cave airflow direction and dissolved co 2 in the stream is generated because the primary co 2 source for the cave air can either be upwind or downwind of the main cave stream fig 6 the primary source of co 2 to the cave atmosphere is a co 2 reservoir within the soil and unsaturated zone above the cave during periods of downdraft summer regime ventilation brings gases through this reservoir into the cave maintaining a high pco 2 within the cave air that limits degassing of co 2 from the cave stream fig 6a during periods of updraft winter regime ventilation brings fresh outside air into the cave reducing the pco 2 of the cave air and enhancing degassing of co 2 from the stream fig 6b though the cave has strong ventilation during both summer and winter conditions the restricted nature of the airflow pathways through the unsaturated zone must produce a sufficiently high surface area to volume ratio that air transiting this zone obtains a high pco 2 5 2 dissolution rate variability during storms and the role of airflow whereas storms play a secondary role in driving variability in dissolution rates there are still statistically significant correlations alpha 0 05 between discharge and dissolution rate fig 11b we can observe these variations clearly on the basis of individual storms and see that they are driven by a combination of dilution and increasing dissolved co 2 fig 14 interestingly airflow direction also appears to modulate the dissolution rate variability within storms with greater storm variability during updraft conditions this is supported by at least three observations 1 variation in dissolution rates is much greater during updraft than downdraft fig 12 2 dissolved co 2 is positively correlated with discharge during updraft but not during downdraft fig 13 3 dissolution rate range during individual storms is correlated to the airflow velocity but not to the range of discharge during the storm fig 15 it is perhaps counterintuitive that cave airflow direction should have any importance for dissolution rate variation during storms however the observed pattern can be explained using an existing conceptual model for unsaturated zone co 2 within karst mattey et al 2016 and a basic mathematical framework for transport of co 2 within the karst unsaturated zone covington 2016 mattey et al 2016 argue based on eight years of field measurements at the rock of gibraltar and other observations of deep co 2 within karst systems atkinson 1977a wood 1985 wood and petraitis 1984 that karst unsaturated zones contain a body of ground air which is a reservoir of co 2 produced by the microbial decay of organic matter that has infiltrated to depth cave air is considered to be a mixture of surface air with ground air where the percentages depend largely on the outside temperature and the resulting direction of air circulation through the unsaturated zone other work has suggested that the co 2 in cave air is often associated with root respiration of the deepest rooting plants breecker et al 2012 again suggesting production at depth at blowing springs cave the carbon isotope ratios of co 2 are consistent with soil root respiration knierim et al 2017 with summer values around 21 so it is unclear whether the source of deep unsaturated zone co 2 might be particulate organic matter or root respiration however to explain the observations we hypothesize that there is a substantial volume of co 2 stored at depth in the unsaturated zone during winter periods of cave updraft storms bring water that is charged with co 2 frequently 2 000 4 000 ppm these concentrations are substantially higher than typically observed in soil at the site during fall winter 1 500 ppm in a prior study knierim et al 2017 this observation supports the conception of a reservoir of high pco 2 within the unsaturated zone atkinson 1977a mattey et al 2016 additionally a simple model of co 2 transport within a vertical fracture suggests that vertical flow of water through karst fractures can efficiently redistribute co 2 within the subsurface pushing it to greater depth covington 2016 observations of hysteresis between discharge and dissolved co 2 with higher co 2 during the recession have also been interpreted as indicating that later arriving diffuse recharge water can transport soil and unsaturated zone co 2 into karst conduits vesper and white 2004 therefore it is physically plausible that vertical flow of water through the unsaturated zone during a storm could effectively transport a pulse of co 2 to the water table downward transport of co 2 during winter storms produces variation in the cave stream because the winter airflow regime has disconnected the cave stream from the co 2 source fig 6b reduced the pco 2 of the cave stream and the pulse of high co 2 has a large effect conversely in the summer airflow regime downdraft the cave air is already in contact with the ground air fig 6a because the air is entering the cave via the soil and unsaturated zone therefore degassing is reduced and the cave stream is maintained at high pco 2 consequently summer storms produce much less variation in co 2 within the cave stream and therefore less variation in dissolution rate this conceptual model is also supported by previous work at blowing springs cave where isotopic disequilibrium between dissolved inorganic carbon dic in the cave stream and co 2 in the cave air was greater during winter periods when the cave stream is disconnected from the co 2 source but approached equilibrium during summer when cave air co 2 was higher knierim et al 2017 5 3 dissolution rate variation in the context of similar studies since discharge is not the primary driver of variation in dissolution rates at the study site normal concepts of magnitude and frequency break down as they are based on flood recurrence intervals to estimate rates of geomorphic work in the cave stream we are better off asking which way is it blowing rather than how much is it flowing however this pattern is seemingly not a universal one and it is worth putting into the context of the limited set of other studies of dissolution rate variation in karst conduits first we compare against the nearby study of langle and copperhead springs covington and vaughn 2019 located in the same limestone layer and climate setting as blowing springs cave these two springs compose a karst underflow overflow system where langle spring is completely phreatic and carries most of the flow at low discharge langle and copperhead spring both exhibit strong seasonal co 2 variation that is the strongest control on dissolution rate data suggest that langle drains a relatively small phreatic conduit which has no ability to ventilate langle spring has the highest variation in co 2 concentration of any of the available studies of dissolution rates within karst conduits with summer values that exceed 20 000 ppm and winter values of about 3 000 ppm one potential reason for the higher co 2 concentrations and strong production related signal is that land use in the spring recharge zone is predominantly pasture and grasslands have higher co 2 production rates than forested areas smith and johnson 2004 knierim et al 2015 knierim et al 2017 copperhead spring has peak values in early summer of about 15 000 ppm and then late summer values of about 5 000 6 000 ppm which are similar to peak summer values at blowing spring the sudden decrease in co 2 at copperhead spring in the early summer coincides with a discharge threshold below this threshold the cave system feeding this spring begins to ventilate and co 2 decreases dramatically as a result of the onset of ventilation covington and vaughn 2019 therefore if we want to estimate dissolution rates at langle spring we need to consider variability in soil co 2 production and might ask ourselves is it growing whereas at copperhead spring which is intermittently ventilated it is more important to ask is it blowing in the two other cave streams where dissolution rate or saturation state has been quantified as a function of discharge groves and meiman 2005 or recurrence interval palmer 2007b the cave water was supersaturated during most of the study period with only short periods of active dissolution occurring at high flow groves and meiman 2005 studied the logsdon river in mammoth cave kentucky and palmer 2007b studied mcfail s cave new york both studies found that the majority of the dissolution occurs in the top 5 flow regime therefore these sites fall more into the standard magnitude and frequency framework where active dissolution is driven by high flow events one reason for the tendency toward supersaturation at these two sites may be that they are more highly ventilated than any of the other study sites mammoth cave is the longest cave in the world gunn 2004 has many entrances and is consequently well ventilated this high density of entrances may produce relatively low co 2 concentrations in the cave air during all seasons therefore water flows through the soil and unsaturated zone dissolving calcite under relatively high pco 2 conditions then it enters the cave stream is brought to much lower pco 2 and becomes supersaturated storm events may in part increase dissolution rates by reducing ventilation when portions of the system flood to the ceiling during the largest flood event in the study logsdon river remained under pipefull flow conditions for 114 h groves and meiman 2005 an additional factor that may create variability with discharge is the nature of recharge to the system approximately 40 of the recharge to logsdon river is allogenic from streams flowing off of sandstone caprock it is plausible that flow from non carbonates and changes to the percentage of that flow during floods could increase the sensitivity of dissolution rates to discharge atkinson 1977b scanlon and thrailkill 1987 worthington et al 1992 palmer 2007b also describes mcfail s cave as well aerated and suggests that the cave stream is supersaturated because of ventilation and degassing of co 2 therefore it is plausible that episodic storm driven dissolution is a common pattern within highly ventilated karst conduit systems which typically have low concentrations of dissolved co 2 5 4 the role of ventilation over the history of cave evolution taken within the context of prior studies groves and meiman 2005 palmer 2007b covington and vaughn 2019 the data presented here elucidate how ventilation may drive changes in dissolution rates within karst conduits as they evolve the observed behaviors can be arranged on an axis of increasing ventilation fig 16 except during periods of base level aggradation karst systems will also tend to evolve along this axis over time from no ventilation at the beginning toward highly ventilated as they mature during the first stage of karst conduit evolution the pre breakthrough stage fig 16a the penetration length of undersaturated water is less than the length of the incipient conduit dreybrodt 1996 covington et al 2012 consequently calcite dissolution under closed system conditions within the flowpath leads to the consumption of co 2 which greatly reduces dissolution rates at depth once breakthrough occurs and the penetration length exceeds the flowpath length then water can traverse the conduit without substantially reduced pco 2 despite the closed system conditions covington and vaughn 2019 this is the stage that we observe at langle spring fig 16b the pattern that we refer to as is it growing this stage shows the highest average dissolution rates among the study sites compared here these high rates are maintained because the water is at high pco 2 and has no means of degassing that co 2 at langle spring there is a strong seasonal signal driven by co 2 production however some karst springs have very low annual variation in pco 2 atkinson 1977a so this seasonal pattern is not universal why some karst systems have a strong production related signal and some do not remains an open question the third stage is it blowing represents the onset of intermittent ventilation fig 16c where the karst system is intermittently ventilated for copperhead spring this switch is driven by changes in water level the temporal changes in dissolution rate at this site show a seasonal signal but superimposed on that seasonal signal is a strong switching behavior where periods of ventilation dramatically reduce the dissolution rates the fourth stage moderately ventilated is observed at blowing springs cave fig 16d during this stage the conduit undergoes continuous ventilation however the direction of airflow strongly impacts dissolution rates we ask which way is it blowing the seasonal ventilation patterns that are driven by chimney effect airflow create a seasonal pattern in dissolution rate as the co 2 source switches between being upwind and downwind of the cave stream the seasonal pattern is more muted than in the previous two stages and the average dissolution rates are lower at blowing springs we see secondary variability driven by storms which typically increase dissolution rates however even this storm variation is modulated by airflow direction to create the moderately ventilated pattern of dissolution rate variability the co 2 of air passing through the zone of co 2 sources must be strongly influenced by those sources the exact physical requirements for this influence are unclear however the rate and spatial distributions of co 2 production may be important furthermore the air pathways must have a sufficiently high surface area to volume ratio in order to create effective exchange of co 2 this may be more likely if airflow is divided between many smaller pathways clearly if an air pathway is too open then it will rapidly bring in outside air that reduces the pco 2 the final stage is a highly ventilated cave fig 16e and is illustrated by prior studies at mammoth cave and mcfail s cave here we return to the more standard framework for considering variation in geomorphic work within a stream how much is it flowing within these systems ventilation is sufficiently strong that the stream is normally in supersaturated conditions there may still be a seasonal variation in co 2 groves and meiman 2005 but dissolution primarily occurs during short term high flow events this variation may be driven by dilution particularly in the case of allogenic recharge and may also be driven by temporary shutoff or reduction of ventilation as many conduits transition into full pipe conditions during a flood pulses of co 2 brought through the unsaturated zone by water may also impact cave stream co 2 as observed at blowing springs cave after initial conduit breakthrough 2nd stage fig 16 the overall pattern is one of increasing ventilation and as a result decreasing pco 2 and decreasing dissolution rates palmer 2007b therefore we might expect that chemical erosion rates within cave streams gradually reduce over the history of evolution except perhaps during periods of base level rise where more conduits would become flooded this trend toward reduced chemical erosion rates over time also has implications for the importance of mechanical erosion within cave streams since instantaneous chemical erosion rates are limited to relatively low magnitudes in comparison to mechanical erosion covington et al 2015 this result suggests that mechanical erosion processes should become much more important once caves are well ventilated for the well ventilated end member only intermittent dissolution is observed during floods these same flood events are likely to overcome thresholds for transport of sediment and consequent mechanical erosion using the tortoise and the hare analogy simms 2004 chemical erosion processes are most effective when they occur nearly continuously tortoise if chemical erosion processes become intermittent mechanical erosion is likely to dominate while we have sketched a broad hypothesis about how ventilation controls the rate of calcite dissolution within karst conduits and how that role might evolve as a karst system matures the observed patterns come from a relatively limited set of karst systems that are far from spanning the full range of climatic and geological settings of karst therefore there are likely other potential controls on dissolution rate variability and perhaps other ways in which ventilation interacts with co 2 dynamics the conceptualization in fig 16 is relatively simplistic and it seems likely to grow in complexity as further sites are studied and more dimensions of the problem are understood importantly all of the sites discussed are dominated by autogenic recharge it seems plausible that sites dominated by allogenic recharge will display somewhat different dynamics for example ventilation may not bring water to a supersaturated state because dissolved load is always sufficiently low dilution may be more important however patterns of co 2 production and degassing have also been shown to control spatial patterns of dissolution within allogenically recharged systems covington et al 2013 here we have categorized each study site into a single pattern stage of fig 16 but most karst systems will contain a range of ventilation conditions within them therefore the presented stages may also represent spatial contrasts in dissolution rate dynamics within different portions of a karst system that have different ventilation strengths processes such as co 2 production ventilation and gas exchange are currently absent from numerical models of speleogenesis developing and exploring mathematical models for these processes would aid future understanding of the long term interactions among ventilation co 2 dynamics and calcite dissolution and how they influence the rates and patterns of cave development 6 conclusions we collected time series data from a stream cave in arkansas to study the temporal variation in calcite dissolution rates and the factors that drive them ventilation of the cave atmosphere is driven by external temperature changes through the process of chimney effect airflow the direction of air flow is the primary control on gaseous co 2 within the cave atmosphere with low co 2 during periods with updraft when the cave is effectively ventilated by outside air and high co 2 during periods of downdraft when outside air flows through a zone of high co 2 before entering the main cave passage in turn dissolved co 2 in the cave stream is strongly impacted by the concentration of co 2 in the cave atmosphere generating a seasonal variation in dissolved co 2 that emerges as the primary driver of dissolution rate variability within the cave stream dissolution rate is more strongly correlated with cave airflow direction than it is with discharge indicating that the standard framework of geomorphic work partitioned by flood stage is inappropriate for this site we also find that the variations of dissolution rates during individual storm events are modulated by airflow direction with more variation occurring during updraft winter conditions we compare the results from this study with prior studies of dissolution rate variability within karst systems and propose a preliminary framework to explain the different observed patterns of dissolution rate variation along an axis of increasing cave ventilation we suggest that the onset of ventilation reduces the rates of chemical erosion within karst systems and that as karst systems mature they will generally evolve toward greater ventilation and lower dissolution rates this effect may accentuate the importance of mechanical erosion during the later stages of cave evolution 7 data availability the data

4926,erosion rates in streams vary dramatically over time as differences in streamflow and sediment load enhance or inhibit erosion processes within cave streams and other bedrock channels incising soluble rocks changes in water chemistry are an important factor in determining how erosion rates will vary in both time and space prior studies in surface streams springs and caves suggest that variation in dissolved co 2 is the strongest control on variation in calcite dissolution rates however the controls on co 2 variation remain poorly quantified limited data suggest that ventilation of karst systems can substantially influence dissolved co 2 within karst conduits however the interactions among cave ventilation air water co 2 exchange and dissolution dynamics have not been studied in detail in this study three years of time series measurements of dissolved and gaseous co 2 cave airflow velocity and specific conductance from blowing springs cave arkansas were analyzed and used to estimate continuous calcite dissolution rates and quantify the correlations between those rates and potential physical and chemical drivers we find that chimney effect airflow creates temperature driven switches in airflow direction and that the resulting seasonal changes in airflow regulate both gaseous and dissolved co 2 within the cave as in previous studies partial pressure of co 2 pco 2 is the strongest chemical control of dissolution rate variability however we also show that cave airflow direction rather than streamflow is the strongest physical driver of changes in dissolution rate contrary to the typical situation in surface channel erosion where floods largely determine the timing and extent of geomorphic work at the study site chemical erosion is typically active in the summer during periods of cave downdraft airflow from upper to lower entrances and inactive in the winter during updraft airflow from lower to upper entrances storms provide only minor perturbations to this overall pattern we also find that airflow direction modulates dissolution rate variation during storms with higher storm variability during updraft than during downdraft finally we compare our results with the limited set of other studies that have examined dissolution rate variation within cave streams and draw an initial hypothesis that evolution of cave ventilation patterns strongly impacts how dissolution rate dynamics evolve over the lifetime of karst conduits keywords karst bedrock channel cave ventilation carbon dioxide dissolution 1 introduction the variation in geomorphic rates has an important influence on the relationship between erosional processes and the landforms that they produce wolman and miller 1960 whereas concepts of the magnitude and frequency of geomorphic work have long been explored in the study of processes on earth s surface fewer studies have examined the variability in rates of cave development or the factors that control this variation groves and meiman 2005 cave passages are often developed by subsurface streams incising through bedrock since many cave streams carry substantial sediment loads farrant and smart 2011 mechanical erosion processes such as occur within surface bedrock channels whipple et al 2000 undoubtedly are active within these streams however most caves develop in karst settings within highly soluble rocks where chemical dissolution of the rock is an important driver of channel development and evolution ford and williams 2007 palmer 2007a a number of studies have measured solute export from basins and used these data to examine how rates of chemical denudation vary with streamflow wolman and miller 1960 gunn 1982 schmidt 1985 goudie and viles 1999 these studies conclude that low to moderate flows produce an important percentage of the overall chemical geomorphic work at the basin scale however rates of channel incision by dissolution and basin wide chemical denudation do not in general display the same relationship to streamflow groves and meiman 2005 show that in the logsdon river passage of mammoth cave kentucky conduit wall dissolution rates are a strong function of discharge with 87 of the work being done during high discharges that occur less than 5 of the time in contrast they find that solute export is important across a range of discharges with only 38 of the export occurring during the highest discharge class palmer 2007b finds a similar relationship between discharge and calcite dissolution rate in mcfail s cave new york analysis of water chemistry data from streams across the united states suggests that variability in calcite dissolution rates at most sites is more strongly correlated with variability in dissolved co 2 than with streamflow and that in channel dissolution rates are often much higher than estimates of basin wide denudation rates covington et al 2015 covington and vaughn 2019 show that seasonal variability in co 2 is the primary driver for variation in calcite dissolution rates at a pair of karst underflow overflow springs additionally they hypothesize that during low flows ventilation within the conduit feeding the overflow spring drives a reduction in co 2 and consequently dissolution rates in general previous investigators have argued that cave ventilation which often occurs in the later stages of cave development may reduce the rates of chemical erosion within cave streams as caves becomes more mature palmer 2007b while it is clear that both floods and co 2 dynamics are important drivers of dissolution rate variability within cave streams there are relatively few cave sites where dissolution rate variability has been quantified groves and meiman 2005 palmer 2007b covington and vaughn 2019 this lack of data limits the ability to generalize about the controls on calcite dissolution rate variability here we analyze water chemistry data in a cave stream in the ozark plateaus physiographic region of arkansas to explore potential controls of dissolution rate variability we use recently developed techniques for direct high temporal resolution measurements of dissolved co 2 johnson et al 2010 combined with time series of specific conductance spc to estimate calcite dissolution rates over a three year period these measurements are complemented by simultaneous measurements of cave air co 2 and cave airflow velocity this enables us to explore interactions between cave atmosphere dynamics and cave stream chemistry 2 description of field site blowing springs cave is located in bella vista arkansas within the springfield plateau region of the ozark plateaus fig 1 the cave is developed in the cherty mississippian boone limestone primarily within the st joe limestone member mcfarland 1998 because of a high concentration of chert and clay impurities the boone limestone develops a mantled karst where a thick regolith composed of chert and clay covers the karst surface brahana 2011 within the region surrounding the cave the boone limestone spans the topography from valley floors to ridges the cave therefore is autogenically recharged through a regolith cover because of the regolith cover the region contains few obvious surface karst features such as sinkholes though most of the valleys located in the recharge area are dry except during periods of intense precipitation the land cover in the recharge area is a mixture of deciduous forest and low intensity residential the region has a temperate continental climate with a mean annual air temperature of approximately 15 c adamski et al 1995 and a mean annual precipitation of about 114 cm per year cm yr pugh and westerman 2014 blowing springs cave contains 2 397 meters m of mapped cave passage and consists of a dendritic stream network fig 1 water enters the main cave stream through a number of small infeeding channels and through many percolating fractures within the cave ceiling though the largest source of discharge to the cave stream is the upstream sump many of the cave passages are oriented along an orthogonal set of ne sw and nw se trending fractures the only known entrance of the cave is at the spring and as the name suggests the cave exhibits strong airflow with air blowing out of the spring entrance during times of warm outside temperatures the spring emerges near the elevation of the local base level stream which is little sugar creek 3 methods 3 1 collection of time series data time series data of water quality and cave atmospheric parameters were collected at a site located approximately 150 m inside the cave entrance which is labeled as cave measurement station in fig 1 cave airflow velocity cave air barometric pressure and co 2 concentrations in the cave air and water were logged on a campbell scientifictmcr850 datalogger cave airflow velocity and direction were measured using a campbell scientific windsonic1 2d ultrasonic anemometer resolution 0 01 m s accuracy 2 at 12 m s directional accuracy 3 barometric pressure was measured using a campbell scientifictmcs100 sensor accuracy 0 5 hpa co 2 concentrations in the air and water were measured using vaisala gmm220 co 2 transmitters with a range of 0 to 5 000 ppm ppm accuracy 1 5 of range 2 of reading the co 2 sensors were protected from moisture with a waterproof breathable membrane ptfe as described in johnson et al 2010 one sensor was exposed to the cave air and the other was submerged in the cave stream to enable direct measurement of the partial pressure of co 2 pco 2 of the water this setup provides a more reliable means of recording pco 2 than continuous measurement of ph as the co 2 sensors exhibit much less drift over time than ph electrodes johnson et al 2010 covington and vaughn 2019 for the co 2 sensors a warm up period of 15 min was used before a measurement was taken this warm up period allowed thermal equilibration of the sensor and helped to drive any moisture out of the sensor optics we found that this warm up period was crucial as substantial instrument drift occurred within the first few minutes of power up measured values of pco 2 were not adjusted with water depth as described by johnson et al 2010 because subsequent theoretical analysis and experiments have shown that this adjustment is incorrect blackstock et al 2019 co 2 readings were taken once an hour to conserve power whereas other parameters recorded on the cr850 were read on a one minute interval in this study all co 2 concentrations are reported in ppm which are nominally values of ppm volume ppmv within a gas phase where the concentrations for our dissolved measurements are within a headspace equilibrated to the dissolved phase air and water values are reported in the same units to enable direct comparison and we use ppm as these are the units typically employed in cave atmospheric studies while the instrument reports ppmv it actually directly measures molecular density concentrations in ppmv must be corrected both for pressure and temperature we are specifically interested in pco 2 which can be more directly calculated from molecular density than can ppmv only requiring a temperature correction and the factory calibration pressure blackstock et al 2019 which we assume to be 1 atm we apply the temperature correction and then 1 ppm is equivalent to a pco 2 of 10 6 atm therefore our reported ppm values are directly proportional to pco 2 and can be thought of as a type of pco 2 value albeit with unusual units the specific conductance spc and temperature of the cave stream were measured at the same site as co 2 on a time interval of 5 min using an onset hobotmu24 001 freshwater conductivity logger with an accuracy of 3 or 5 microsiemens per centimeter μ s cm outside of the cave air temperature and relative humidity were measured at a 5 min interval using an onset hobotmu23 001 temperature accuracy 0 21 c and relative humidity accuracy 2 5 logger that was mounted onto a tree to provide a proxy for stable cave temperature we deployed an onset hobotmu20l 04 pressure and temperature logger in the cave air approximately 400 m inside the cave accuracy 0 44 c unless specified otherwise all data presented here are hourly averages to align with the frequency of co 2 measurements the site within the cave was visited roughly every four weeks which was the approximate duration of the battery power supply two 12 volt 20 amp hour lithium ion batteries during each site visit batteries were changed data downloaded and quality control on site measurements were made of specific conductance water temperature and co 2 concentrations in the air and water to make on site measurements of co 2 a portable vaisala gmm220 was used that was connected to a battery and data logger spot measurements of co 2 in the water required a roughly 30 min equilibration period for gas concentrations to exchange across the ptfe membrane whereas a partial record of stage and estimated discharge is available at the spring frequent human disturbances of the stream channel near the weir the site is located in a park reduced the quality of the available dataset rather than using this corrupted record we employ a modification of an estimation of discharge at blowing springs cave developed by knierim et al 2015 using the nearby united states geological survey usgs streamflow gaging station on little sugar creek usgs station no 07188838 little sugar creek near pineville missouri with data available from the usgs national water information system u s geological survey 2020 knierim et al 2015 found that a linear regression provided a reasonable approximation of discharge at blowing springs however they also noted that blowing springs exhibited a minimum baseflow discharge and therefore they introduced a threshold minimum value to remove the sharp threshold and reduce errors on moderate discharge values we introduce a new regression to daily averaged discharges using a sigmoidal function in log space fig 2 1 log q bsc a 1 exp d log q lsc b c where q bsc is the discharge at blowing springs in m 3 s and q lsc is the streamflow in little sugar creek and the best fit values of the fitting parameters are a 1 99 b 1 14 c 2 07 and d 3 24 the root mean squared percentage error rmspe in this model is 33 the sigmoidal shape nicely captures the transition to baseflow and also captures a possible rolloff at high discharges 1 2 m 3 s that is evident in the 15 min data many karst springs do exhibit maximum discharges bonacci 2001 though this upper rolloff also has limited impact on our estimates due to the small number of data points that fall at these highest discharges most of our results are independent of this discharge estimate which is primarily used to indicate the occurrence and frequency of high and low flow periods to examine how dissolution rate varies with flow the precise magnitudes of discharge are not necessary for interpreting our data 3 2 calculation of dissolution rates in order to calculate dissolution rates from available kinetic rate equations we need values for the dissolved ca concentration and the pco 2 while we measure pco 2 directly ca concentrations were estimated from spc time series collected at the site as has also been done in prior studies of dissolution rate dynamics within karst systems groves and meiman 2005 covington and vaughn 2019 and is appropriate where water is predominantly ca hco 3 type to estimate ca we use a linear regression on available spc and ca data n 109 from a prior study at blowing springs cave knierim et al 2017 we find that ca 0 175 spc 2 51 where ca is concentration in mg l the rmspe of this relationship is 10 however uncertainties are larger for lower spc values therefore for error propagation purposes we divide the data into quartiles and use separate uncertainty values for each quartile these uncertainties range from 4 5 to 13 7 these data and further details on error estimation can be found in the data repository described in the data availability section of this paper to calculate dissolution rates from ca and pco 2 time series we use two available calcite kinetic equations which we refer to as the pwp plummer et al 1978 and palmer equations palmer 1991 both equations are derived from the same experimental dataset but the palmer equation is a direct fit to the data whereas the pwp equation incorporates a more mechanistic approach to parameter estimation the palmer equation generates a closer fit to the observed dissolution rates near saturation and also provides parameter values for impure calcite which is more appropriate for limestone covington and vaughn 2019 found that the palmer equation provided much closer estimates of mass loss rates of limestone tablets deployed in the field and therefore it is likely that these rates are more accurate in natural settings the pwp equation sometimes produces negative rates which might suggest calcite precipitation however calcite precipitation normally does not occur until waters are highly supersaturated therefore negative pwp rates are not necessarily indicative of precipitation in time series of dissolution rates we show both the pwp and palmer equations however when studying sensitivity of rates to various potential controls it is helpful to have a broader range of values including a range of negative values that represent different extents of supersaturation therefore we use pwp rates to explore controls on variability even though the magnitude of the rates is likely too high covington and vaughn 2019 rates predicted by both equations typically vary monotonically with one another both dissolution rate equations were calculated using algorithms in the olm python package v0 36 covington et al 2015 which is available on github https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 4030690 uncertainties in dissolution rates were estimated using monte carlo error propagation of uncertainties in ca and pco 2 4 results 4 1 large scale patterns in the time series data the water chemistry and cave atmosphere parameters were recorded over a period of approximately three years oct 2014 jan 2018 co 2 concentrations in air and water range between near atmospheric concentration 500 ppm to above 5 000 ppm fig 3 a for a few short periods pco 2 in the water exceeded the measurement range of the sensor deployed 5 500 ppm concentrations in the water almost always exceeded those in the air both dissolved and gaseous co 2 concentrations within the cave showed seasonal patterns with higher concentrations in summer and lower concentrations during winter gaseous co 2 within the cave dropped near atmospheric values for much of the winter dissolved co 2 often exhibited spikes to higher values associated with high discharge events gaseous co 2 displayed strong diurnal variability during certain periods particularly during the spring and fall these periods of variability are associated with times when outside air temperatures are near those of the cave air temperature which is approximately the mean surface air temperature badino 2010 cave airflow velocity also had a seasonal pattern with outward positive airflow during warm periods and inward negative airflow during cold periods fig 3b there was diurnal variability in airflow velocity particularly during spring and fall periods with some days exhibiting both inward and outward airflow at different times of day again these periods of high variability are times when outside temperatures are near the temperature of the cave atmosphere specific conductance displayed a range from 65 to 265 μ s cm variability in spc was more strongly related to discharge than to season figs 3c d spc was high during periods of low flow and low during periods of high flow particularly flood events all records display gaps that are associated with sensor or power failures however the spc record is the least complete with a large number of gaps resulting from sensor failure damage during storms or download failure which lead to memory filling on the datalogger before the next opportunity to download as can be seen visually in fig 3c d there is a strong correlation between specific conductance and stream discharge q the relationship between these parameters is explicitly displayed in fig 4 along with a 4th order polynomial regression between log q and specific conductance given by 2 spc ax 4 bx 3 cx 2 d where x log q a 48 6 b 296 2 c 639 4 and d 649 2 the coefficients were determined using the polyfit function from the numpy package in python because of the large number of gaps and the strong relationship between discharge and spc the daily estimated spc using eq 2 is shown in fig 3c the root mean squared error rmse in estimated spc is 14 9 μ s cm the valid discharge range for the fit is from approximately 10 l s to 1 000 l s during periods where spc data were lacking we estimate ca from these modeled values to account for additional uncertainty introduced by this step we divide these data into 10 percentile based bins of discharge and calculate the rmse for each of these bins we use gaussian error propagation to convert these uncertainties in spc into uncertainties in ca which are used in the monte carlo error propagation for the dissolution rate calculations 4 2 relationship between cave airflow and external air temperature the seasonal and diurnal patterns in cave airflow velocity suggest a relationship between outside air temperature and cave airflow as would be expected in the case of chimney effect airflow wigley et al 1976 luetscher et al 2008 badino 2010 covington and perne 2015 chimney effect airflow is an airflow mechanism driven by density contrasts between the cave air and outside air and occurs within cave systems with more than one opening to the outside during periods of warm outside temperatures cave air is more dense than outside air and it is therefore pushed from upper entrances to lower entrances during cold outside temperatures cave air is less dense than outside air and rises from lower entrances to upper entrances note that such airflow does not require human sized entrances or large elevation differences millimeter scale fracture apertures and decimeters of elevation difference are sufficient covington 2016 the pressure difference δ p that drives chimney effect airflow can be approximated using cf badino 2010 3 δ p ρ in gh δ t t ext where ρ in is the density of the air inside the cave g is earth s gravitational acceleration h is the height difference between the two entrances δ t is the difference between cave and external temperature and t ext is the external air temperature in kelvin chimney effect airflow is typically turbulent and therefore the darcy weisbach equation for flow of fluid in a pipe provides a reasonable approximation luetscher and jeannin 2004 for airflow velocity v with 4 v 2 d h δ p ρ in fl where d h is the hydraulic diameter of the flow path f is the darcy weisbach friction factor and l is the length of the flow path combining these two equations leads to 5 v 2 d h gh δ t flt ext where one can see that the airflow velocity is predicted to scale with the square root of the temperature difference between outside and cave air to test the plausibility of chimney effect airflow as the primary mechanism behind the observed airflow in blowing springs cave airflow velocity is plotted against the temperature difference between inside and outside air and a square root relationship is fit to the data fig 5 not only is there a strong relationship between temperature difference and cave airflow velocity but the shape of the relationship is closely matched by a square root function v r δ t 1 2 where the best fit value of the resistance factor r 0 18 there are no known human sized upper entrances to blowing springs cave however we can use knowledge of the cave system to estimate appropriate values of unknown parameters in eq 5 using l 1 000 m which is the approximate distance from the entrance to the upstream sump and h 25 m which is the approximate elevation difference between the spring entrance and the valleys feeding the cave that are likely to hold upper entrances using values of g 9 8 m s 2 and f 0 05 which is a typical value for a rough pipe and high reynolds number larock et al 2000 we can estimate that the hydraulic diameter would have to be approximately equal to 1 m in order to produce the observed value of r though diameters of the mapped portion of the cave are highly variable fig 1 with values reaching up to 5 10 m within larger rooms a diameter of 1 m is roughly consistent with observed diameters in much of the cave the untraversable upper portions of the flow paths must also be substantially smaller because they are too small for a human to enter to make the link between airflow direction and the chimney effect mechanism explicit in our further discussion from this point on we will refer to cave airflow direction as either updraft or downdraft fig 6 updraft occurs during periods when the cave air is less dense than outside air e g winter and air flows from lower to upper entrances inward downdraft occurs when the cave air is denser than outside air e g summer and air flows from upper to lower entrances outward because the airflow velocity was measured near a lower entrance updraft corresponds to inward airflow negative velocity and downdraft corresponds to outward airflow positive velocity for the study period the cave exhibited nearly continuous downdraft from june 1 to october 1 and relatively consistent updraft from december 1 to march 1 with occasional winter reversals during warm periods the spring and fall seasons exhibit frequent switching between updraft and downdraft often diurnally 4 3 relationship between airflow velocity and co 2 the seasonal patterns in cave airflow and co 2 in the air and water are well aligned fig 3 additionally there are strong relationships between co 2 and cave airflow on short timescales fig 7 during periods of diurnal airflow reversals co 2 in the cave air also shows daily peaks and troughs when airflow direction switches from downdraft to updraft cave air co 2 drops suddenly to concentrations near atmospheric 500 ppm as outside air is quickly brought to the location of the sensor when airflow switches from updraft to downdraft cave air co 2 rises somewhat more slowly likely as a result of mixing of high and low co 2 air within the cave atmosphere dissolved co 2 within the cave stream does not respond as rapidly to airflow reversals as the cave air however the cave stream co 2 does have a muted response that has a lag of a few days fig 7 dissolved and gaseous co 2 both display statistically significant correlations p value 0 0001 with airflow velocity when averaged over daily or weekly timescales fig 8 here we quantify correlation using spearman s rank correlation coefficient because the relationships are non linear helsel and hirsch 2002 correlations are stronger over the weekly timescales than the daily timescales particularly for dissolved co 2 the gaseous co 2 concentrations display a clear threshold near zero airflow velocity fig 8 which divides time periods with updraft and downdraft during periods of updraft the cave air co 2 is typically near outside atmospheric concentrations whereas during downdraft concentrations substantially increase above atmospheric values the relationship between dissolved co 2 and cave airflow does not display a clear threshold at zero cave airflow but still has a clear pattern of lower concentrations during updraft and higher concentrations during downdraft fig 8 4 4 dissolution rate dynamics in the cave stream the dissolution rates show a strong seasonal signal that is in phase with the seasonal co 2 variation fig 9 that is there are higher rates of dissolution during the summer months when pco 2 is also high and the water is undersaturated with respect to calcite lower rates of dissolution occur during the winter months frequently negative pwp rates when pco 2 is low and the water is typically supersaturated the average of this seasonal signal is near calcite saturation or zero dissolution rate but the stream spends slightly more time in the undersaturated condition when dissolution is active in addition to the seasonal signal there is clear variability on daily to weekly timescales to study the chemical controls on dissolution rate variation dissolution rates averaged over daily timescales are plotted versus the two primary chemical drivers fig 10 dissolved co 2 and a proxy for dissolved load spc to quantify the correlations between the chemical drivers and dissolution rate we calculated spearman s rank correlation coefficients both chemical drivers correlate with dissolution rates p value 0 0001 but co 2 is more strongly correlated ρ 0 80 than spc ρ 0 44 the cloud of points in the dissolution rate co 2 plot fig 10a shows a relatively sharp edge at low dissolution rate this edge is a result of baseflow conditions where spc displays a typical value of about 220 μ s cm in addition to direct chemical drivers dissolution rates vary as a function of external physical controls that produce variations in those chemical drivers the two most important physical controls on chemical variation at the site are cave airflow velocity and stream discharge cave airflow and particularly its direction is an important driver of dissolved co 2 figs 6 and 8 discharge may produce variation in both dissolved load and dissolved co 2 either through dilution during storm event runoff or alteration of water sources and flowpaths fig 11 shows the relationships between dissolution rate and these two physical drivers over a variety of timescales from daily a b to weekly c d to monthly e f generally when airflow velocity is positive downdraft and discharge is high dissolution rate is high at all timescales cave airflow displays a stronger correlation with dissolution rate than discharge though at the daily timescale the correlations are effectively the same the strength of the correlation between airflow velocity and dissolution rate increases with the duration of the averaging correlation with discharge is similar for daily and weekly timescales and somewhat higher over the monthly timescale all correlations have p values 0 0001 error is known to attenuate correlation spearman 1904 such that large errors will result in bias toward lower correlation as a result true correlations are likely modestly higher than the estimates here particularly for the daily timescale where uncertainties are largest however even for the daily timescale the measured natural variations are substantially larger than the estimated uncertainties since cave airflow velocity emerges as the strongest external driver of dissolution rate variability and because airflow direction is likely to be the most important factor in determining co 2 concentrations we divide the record into days when airflow is on average updraft winter regime and downdraft summer regime dissolution rates are higher during periods of downdraft when the cave air has higher co 2 fig 12 interestingly there is also a strong contrast in the variability of dissolution rates during the two airflow regimes with periods of updraft having much larger variability in rates this effect is further considered below as we examine how dissolution rates vary during storms 4 5 dissolution rate variation during storms to explore how dissolution rates vary during storms we first examine relationships between dissolved co 2 and discharge because co 2 is the chemical parameter most strongly correlated with changes in dissolution rate fig 10 since dissolution rates show more variability during upward airflow one hypothesis might be that airflow direction somehow modulates the variability caused by changes in discharge as an initial test of this hypothesis we examine the relationship between daily averaged values of dissolved co 2 and discharge separated into groups of downdraft and updraft conditions fig 13 dissolved co 2 is correlated with discharge during periods of updraft ρ 0 31 p value 0 0001 whereas there is no statistically significant correlation between dissolved co 2 and discharge during periods of downdraft airflow ρ 0 05 p value 0 38 again due to uncertainties in discharge and resulting attenuation of correlation the real correlations are likely modestly larger than these estimates however since the separation in ρ and p values is quite large we do not expect this to influence the general pattern to further examine the possibility that airflow modulates discharge driven dissolution rate variation during storms we plot time series of chemistry and estimated dissolution rates during storm events two typical examples are shown in fig 14 one during downdraft summer conditions and one during updraft winter conditions the winter storm produces more variation in dissolved co 2 which ranges from about 1 000 ppm to 3 500 ppm gaseous co 2 remains low during most of the event because of the dominance of updraft conditions which bring outside air quickly to the sensor location from the cave entrance spc varies from near maximal values about 220 μ s cm to 115 μ s cm driven by both changes in co 2 and dissolved load the dissolution rate changes sharply during the storm from supersaturated conditions 0 25 mm yr before the storm to highly undersaturated conditions 1 2 mm yr near the peak of the event during the winter storm estimated discharge ranged from 30 l s to 330 l s during the summer storm downdraft conditions prevail and consequently co 2 concentrations in the air remain relatively high at about 3 000 ppm except for during two brief periods of airflow reversal that follow the storm dissolved co 2 is already high 4 000 ppm before the start of the event and peaks about 5 000 ppm during the event therefore there is much less variability of dissolved co 2 during the summer storm than during the winter storm spc decreases during the storm from about 255 μ s cm to about 220 μ s cm displaying less variability than during the winter storm dissolution rate also displays less variability with rates about 0 5 mm yr before the storm and 0 8 mm yr at the peak during the summer storm estimated discharge ranged from 8 4 l s to 80 l s in general winter and spring periods of mostly updraft have higher average values of discharge fig 3 as might be expected from lower rates of evapotranspiration during these cooler periods therefore one possibility is that the correlation between airflow direction and dissolution rate variability fig 12 is spurious and is actually driven by differences in discharge dynamics during these seasons because discharge has a strong negative correlation to dissolved load fig 4 storms with greater discharge variation should also have greater variation in dissolved ca and this could drive greater variation in dissolution rate to explore this possibility we identify all storm events and calculate the range of dissolution rate the average airflow velocity and the range of discharge during each storm over the period of record the beginnings of storms were defined as increases in discharge of at least a factor of two within a period of less than two days the end of a storm event was defined to be a return to 130 of the pre storm discharge or one week after the increase in discharge whichever was shorter because most of the chemical variation occurs during the rising limb the dissolution rate ranges are not particularly sensitive to the criteria for the end of a storm event however including these criteria enables treatment of multi peak events as a single storm we find that change in dissolution rate within a storm was much more strongly correlated to mean cave air velocity during the storm ρ 0 85 p value 0 0004 than it was to the magnitude of the change in discharge ρ 0 23 p value 0 45 as is shown in fig 15 for the storm events for which complete chemical records exist this suggests that cave airflow direction is an important control on dissolution rate variation during storms and that storm dissolution rate variability is not primarily driven by dilution 5 discussion 5 1 controls of dissolution rate variability the concept of the magnitude and frequency of erosional forces is central to understanding how temporal variations in the rates of geomorphic processes influence the long term rates of landscape evolution and the morphologies that develop wolman and miller 1960 this concept is most frequently applied in fluvial systems where frequency relates to the recurrence interval of streamflows of different magnitude however magnitude and frequency have also been discussed in the context of weathering processes such as chemical solution goudie and viles 1999 a variety of studies have quantified variation in rates of chemical geomorphic work at the basin scale by examining the rate of solute export as a function of river streamflow wolman and miller 1960 gunn 1982 schmidt 1985 however quantifying magnitude and frequency within the context of weathering presents some challenges and particularly one must be clear as to the specific process that one is attempting to quantify goudie and viles 1999 calculating chemical weathering rates using river solutes provides a quantification of the magnitude and frequency attributes of solute export from a basin however since solutes are stored within the basin for some unknown time these rates are removed from the rates of actual detachment of the ions from mineral surfaces for example covington et al 2015 show that in stream calcite dissolution rates may be orders of magnitude higher than basin wide denudation rates derived from basin solute export one can imagine similarly that the time variability of rates of dissolution on karst landscape surfaces might be quite different than the time variability in basin wide solute export rates relatively few studies have attempted to quantify the time variation of calcite dissolution rates within karst streams or caves or to understand the controls of this variability groves and meiman 2005 palmer 2007b galdenzi 2012 covington et al 2015 covington and vaughn 2019 the central goal of this study was to examine variability in dissolution rates within a specific cave stream and to develop a mechanistic understanding of the controls on that variability as in previous studies groves and meiman 2005 covington et al 2015 covington and vaughn 2019 we find that the strongest chemical driver of variation in dissolution rates is variation in dissolved co 2 which shows much stronger correlation with dissolution rate at our site than does dissolved load fig 10 in turn dissolved co 2 displays a strong seasonal pattern this seasonal pattern is strongly correlated with seasonal changes in the cave air co 2 that are driven by the direction of cave airflow figs 3a b and 8 which is ultimately controlled by the temperature difference between cave air and outside air eq 5 a conceptual sketch of the interactions between these processes is shown in fig 6 review of time series data over shorter timescales days to weeks provides even stronger evidence for a mechanistic connection between cave airflow and dissolved co 2 where switches in airflow direction strongly perturb co 2 concentrations in the cave atmosphere and the dissolved co 2 in the cave stream responds in a lagged and muted fashion decreasing during periods of low cave air co 2 and increasing during periods of high cave air co 2 fig 7 review of the entire dataset shows that perhaps surprisingly dissolution rate is more strongly correlated with cave airflow velocity than with discharge fig 11 the difference in the correlation strength increases moving from daily to monthly timescales suggesting that cave airflow is most important in impacting the seasonal pattern though still has a strong impact on the timescales of storms similar observations have been made on the impact of cave ventilation on the saturation state of drip water and resulting seasonal biases within speleothem records spötl et al 2005 banner et al 2007 wong et al 2011 and ventilation has also previously been argued to impact spatial or temporal changes in cave stream dissolved co 2 or dissolved load troester and white 1984 jeannin et al 2017 gulley et al 2014 also found that seasonal cave ventilation patterns can explain seasonal changes to dissolved load and dissolved co 2 within a water table cave in florida therefore the patterns observed here cohere with previous studies though our data provide much higher time resolution to examine the connections between ventilation and cave stream saturation state in more detail though the time series data suggest that cave airflow direction is an important control of the seasonal oscillation of dissolved co 2 there may be additional drivers specifically co 2 production in the soil through microbial decay and root respiration is known to vary with surface temperature and solar radiation hibbard et al 2005 lloyd and taylor 1994 at a nearby site with a similar hydrogeological setting covington and vaughn 2019 observed a strong seasonal signal range 20 000 ppm in dissolved co 2 at langle spring arkansas which is thought to drain an unventilated portion of the karst aquifer they hypothesized that this signal derived from seasonal changes in subsurface co 2 production it is uncertain how much of the seasonal signal in dissolved co 2 at blowing springs might also be a function of changes in the rate of co 2 production in contrast to the seasonal respiration driven pattern some karst aquifers that exhibit higher pco 2 at depth than in the soil have very little seasonal co 2 variation at depth atkinson 1977a a prior study at blowing springs cave measured soil co 2 concentrations with summer values frequently being above what we observe in the cave stream and winter values frequently being below knierim et al 2017 additionally the study used stable carbon isotopes to quantify the mixture of atmospheric co 2 versus unsaturated zone co 2 produced via respiration decomposition in the cave atmosphere knierim et al 2017 found that the proportion varied seasonally and additionally that there were different mixing lines for each season highlighting seasonally variable unsaturated zone co 2 sources at the least these observations suggest that there is some storage of co 2 in the unsaturated zone that might reduce seasonal variation in the cave the few available on site measurements of dissolved co 2 at the upstream sump in blowing springs cave indicate a range of approximately 1 500 ppm between summer and winter measurements young 2018 in contrast to the range of approximately 5 000 ppm that we observe near the downstream end of the cave however it is also unclear how much ventilation might occur within the portion of the aquifer that is upstream of the sump therefore whereas there is a clear impact of cave ventilation on the annual co 2 cycle there may also be a seasonal signal driven by production the magnitude of that production signal is uncertain the mechanistic link between cave airflow direction and dissolved co 2 in the stream is generated because the primary co 2 source for the cave air can either be upwind or downwind of the main cave stream fig 6 the primary source of co 2 to the cave atmosphere is a co 2 reservoir within the soil and unsaturated zone above the cave during periods of downdraft summer regime ventilation brings gases through this reservoir into the cave maintaining a high pco 2 within the cave air that limits degassing of co 2 from the cave stream fig 6a during periods of updraft winter regime ventilation brings fresh outside air into the cave reducing the pco 2 of the cave air and enhancing degassing of co 2 from the stream fig 6b though the cave has strong ventilation during both summer and winter conditions the restricted nature of the airflow pathways through the unsaturated zone must produce a sufficiently high surface area to volume ratio that air transiting this zone obtains a high pco 2 5 2 dissolution rate variability during storms and the role of airflow whereas storms play a secondary role in driving variability in dissolution rates there are still statistically significant correlations alpha 0 05 between discharge and dissolution rate fig 11b we can observe these variations clearly on the basis of individual storms and see that they are driven by a combination of dilution and increasing dissolved co 2 fig 14 interestingly airflow direction also appears to modulate the dissolution rate variability within storms with greater storm variability during updraft conditions this is supported by at least three observations 1 variation in dissolution rates is much greater during updraft than downdraft fig 12 2 dissolved co 2 is positively correlated with discharge during updraft but not during downdraft fig 13 3 dissolution rate range during individual storms is correlated to the airflow velocity but not to the range of discharge during the storm fig 15 it is perhaps counterintuitive that cave airflow direction should have any importance for dissolution rate variation during storms however the observed pattern can be explained using an existing conceptual model for unsaturated zone co 2 within karst mattey et al 2016 and a basic mathematical framework for transport of co 2 within the karst unsaturated zone covington 2016 mattey et al 2016 argue based on eight years of field measurements at the rock of gibraltar and other observations of deep co 2 within karst systems atkinson 1977a wood 1985 wood and petraitis 1984 that karst unsaturated zones contain a body of ground air which is a reservoir of co 2 produced by the microbial decay of organic matter that has infiltrated to depth cave air is considered to be a mixture of surface air with ground air where the percentages depend largely on the outside temperature and the resulting direction of air circulation through the unsaturated zone other work has suggested that the co 2 in cave air is often associated with root respiration of the deepest rooting plants breecker et al 2012 again suggesting production at depth at blowing springs cave the carbon isotope ratios of co 2 are consistent with soil root respiration knierim et al 2017 with summer values around 21 so it is unclear whether the source of deep unsaturated zone co 2 might be particulate organic matter or root respiration however to explain the observations we hypothesize that there is a substantial volume of co 2 stored at depth in the unsaturated zone during winter periods of cave updraft storms bring water that is charged with co 2 frequently 2 000 4 000 ppm these concentrations are substantially higher than typically observed in soil at the site during fall winter 1 500 ppm in a prior study knierim et al 2017 this observation supports the conception of a reservoir of high pco 2 within the unsaturated zone atkinson 1977a mattey et al 2016 additionally a simple model of co 2 transport within a vertical fracture suggests that vertical flow of water through karst fractures can efficiently redistribute co 2 within the subsurface pushing it to greater depth covington 2016 observations of hysteresis between discharge and dissolved co 2 with higher co 2 during the recession have also been interpreted as indicating that later arriving diffuse recharge water can transport soil and unsaturated zone co 2 into karst conduits vesper and white 2004 therefore it is physically plausible that vertical flow of water through the unsaturated zone during a storm could effectively transport a pulse of co 2 to the water table downward transport of co 2 during winter storms produces variation in the cave stream because the winter airflow regime has disconnected the cave stream from the co 2 source fig 6b reduced the pco 2 of the cave stream and the pulse of high co 2 has a large effect conversely in the summer airflow regime downdraft the cave air is already in contact with the ground air fig 6a because the air is entering the cave via the soil and unsaturated zone therefore degassing is reduced and the cave stream is maintained at high pco 2 consequently summer storms produce much less variation in co 2 within the cave stream and therefore less variation in dissolution rate this conceptual model is also supported by previous work at blowing springs cave where isotopic disequilibrium between dissolved inorganic carbon dic in the cave stream and co 2 in the cave air was greater during winter periods when the cave stream is disconnected from the co 2 source but approached equilibrium during summer when cave air co 2 was higher knierim et al 2017 5 3 dissolution rate variation in the context of similar studies since discharge is not the primary driver of variation in dissolution rates at the study site normal concepts of magnitude and frequency break down as they are based on flood recurrence intervals to estimate rates of geomorphic work in the cave stream we are better off asking which way is it blowing rather than how much is it flowing however this pattern is seemingly not a universal one and it is worth putting into the context of the limited set of other studies of dissolution rate variation in karst conduits first we compare against the nearby study of langle and copperhead springs covington and vaughn 2019 located in the same limestone layer and climate setting as blowing springs cave these two springs compose a karst underflow overflow system where langle spring is completely phreatic and carries most of the flow at low discharge langle and copperhead spring both exhibit strong seasonal co 2 variation that is the strongest control on dissolution rate data suggest that langle drains a relatively small phreatic conduit which has no ability to ventilate langle spring has the highest variation in co 2 concentration of any of the available studies of dissolution rates within karst conduits with summer values that exceed 20 000 ppm and winter values of about 3 000 ppm one potential reason for the higher co 2 concentrations and strong production related signal is that land use in the spring recharge zone is predominantly pasture and grasslands have higher co 2 production rates than forested areas smith and johnson 2004 knierim et al 2015 knierim et al 2017 copperhead spring has peak values in early summer of about 15 000 ppm and then late summer values of about 5 000 6 000 ppm which are similar to peak summer values at blowing spring the sudden decrease in co 2 at copperhead spring in the early summer coincides with a discharge threshold below this threshold the cave system feeding this spring begins to ventilate and co 2 decreases dramatically as a result of the onset of ventilation covington and vaughn 2019 therefore if we want to estimate dissolution rates at langle spring we need to consider variability in soil co 2 production and might ask ourselves is it growing whereas at copperhead spring which is intermittently ventilated it is more important to ask is it blowing in the two other cave streams where dissolution rate or saturation state has been quantified as a function of discharge groves and meiman 2005 or recurrence interval palmer 2007b the cave water was supersaturated during most of the study period with only short periods of active dissolution occurring at high flow groves and meiman 2005 studied the logsdon river in mammoth cave kentucky and palmer 2007b studied mcfail s cave new york both studies found that the majority of the dissolution occurs in the top 5 flow regime therefore these sites fall more into the standard magnitude and frequency framework where active dissolution is driven by high flow events one reason for the tendency toward supersaturation at these two sites may be that they are more highly ventilated than any of the other study sites mammoth cave is the longest cave in the world gunn 2004 has many entrances and is consequently well ventilated this high density of entrances may produce relatively low co 2 concentrations in the cave air during all seasons therefore water flows through the soil and unsaturated zone dissolving calcite under relatively high pco 2 conditions then it enters the cave stream is brought to much lower pco 2 and becomes supersaturated storm events may in part increase dissolution rates by reducing ventilation when portions of the system flood to the ceiling during the largest flood event in the study logsdon river remained under pipefull flow conditions for 114 h groves and meiman 2005 an additional factor that may create variability with discharge is the nature of recharge to the system approximately 40 of the recharge to logsdon river is allogenic from streams flowing off of sandstone caprock it is plausible that flow from non carbonates and changes to the percentage of that flow during floods could increase the sensitivity of dissolution rates to discharge atkinson 1977b scanlon and thrailkill 1987 worthington et al 1992 palmer 2007b also describes mcfail s cave as well aerated and suggests that the cave stream is supersaturated because of ventilation and degassing of co 2 therefore it is plausible that episodic storm driven dissolution is a common pattern within highly ventilated karst conduit systems which typically have low concentrations of dissolved co 2 5 4 the role of ventilation over the history of cave evolution taken within the context of prior studies groves and meiman 2005 palmer 2007b covington and vaughn 2019 the data presented here elucidate how ventilation may drive changes in dissolution rates within karst conduits as they evolve the observed behaviors can be arranged on an axis of increasing ventilation fig 16 except during periods of base level aggradation karst systems will also tend to evolve along this axis over time from no ventilation at the beginning toward highly ventilated as they mature during the first stage of karst conduit evolution the pre breakthrough stage fig 16a the penetration length of undersaturated water is less than the length of the incipient conduit dreybrodt 1996 covington et al 2012 consequently calcite dissolution under closed system conditions within the flowpath leads to the consumption of co 2 which greatly reduces dissolution rates at depth once breakthrough occurs and the penetration length exceeds the flowpath length then water can traverse the conduit without substantially reduced pco 2 despite the closed system conditions covington and vaughn 2019 this is the stage that we observe at langle spring fig 16b the pattern that we refer to as is it growing this stage shows the highest average dissolution rates among the study sites compared here these high rates are maintained because the water is at high pco 2 and has no means of degassing that co 2 at langle spring there is a strong seasonal signal driven by co 2 production however some karst springs have very low annual variation in pco 2 atkinson 1977a so this seasonal pattern is not universal why some karst systems have a strong production related signal and some do not remains an open question the third stage is it blowing represents the onset of intermittent ventilation fig 16c where the karst system is intermittently ventilated for copperhead spring this switch is driven by changes in water level the temporal changes in dissolution rate at this site show a seasonal signal but superimposed on that seasonal signal is a strong switching behavior where periods of ventilation dramatically reduce the dissolution rates the fourth stage moderately ventilated is observed at blowing springs cave fig 16d during this stage the conduit undergoes continuous ventilation however the direction of airflow strongly impacts dissolution rates we ask which way is it blowing the seasonal ventilation patterns that are driven by chimney effect airflow create a seasonal pattern in dissolution rate as the co 2 source switches between being upwind and downwind of the cave stream the seasonal pattern is more muted than in the previous two stages and the average dissolution rates are lower at blowing springs we see secondary variability driven by storms which typically increase dissolution rates however even this storm variation is modulated by airflow direction to create the moderately ventilated pattern of dissolution rate variability the co 2 of air passing through the zone of co 2 sources must be strongly influenced by those sources the exact physical requirements for this influence are unclear however the rate and spatial distributions of co 2 production may be important furthermore the air pathways must have a sufficiently high surface area to volume ratio in order to create effective exchange of co 2 this may be more likely if airflow is divided between many smaller pathways clearly if an air pathway is too open then it will rapidly bring in outside air that reduces the pco 2 the final stage is a highly ventilated cave fig 16e and is illustrated by prior studies at mammoth cave and mcfail s cave here we return to the more standard framework for considering variation in geomorphic work within a stream how much is it flowing within these systems ventilation is sufficiently strong that the stream is normally in supersaturated conditions there may still be a seasonal variation in co 2 groves and meiman 2005 but dissolution primarily occurs during short term high flow events this variation may be driven by dilution particularly in the case of allogenic recharge and may also be driven by temporary shutoff or reduction of ventilation as many conduits transition into full pipe conditions during a flood pulses of co 2 brought through the unsaturated zone by water may also impact cave stream co 2 as observed at blowing springs cave after initial conduit breakthrough 2nd stage fig 16 the overall pattern is one of increasing ventilation and as a result decreasing pco 2 and decreasing dissolution rates palmer 2007b therefore we might expect that chemical erosion rates within cave streams gradually reduce over the history of evolution except perhaps during periods of base level rise where more conduits would become flooded this trend toward reduced chemical erosion rates over time also has implications for the importance of mechanical erosion within cave streams since instantaneous chemical erosion rates are limited to relatively low magnitudes in comparison to mechanical erosion covington et al 2015 this result suggests that mechanical erosion processes should become much more important once caves are well ventilated for the well ventilated end member only intermittent dissolution is observed during floods these same flood events are likely to overcome thresholds for transport of sediment and consequent mechanical erosion using the tortoise and the hare analogy simms 2004 chemical erosion processes are most effective when they occur nearly continuously tortoise if chemical erosion processes become intermittent mechanical erosion is likely to dominate while we have sketched a broad hypothesis about how ventilation controls the rate of calcite dissolution within karst conduits and how that role might evolve as a karst system matures the observed patterns come from a relatively limited set of karst systems that are far from spanning the full range of climatic and geological settings of karst therefore there are likely other potential controls on dissolution rate variability and perhaps other ways in which ventilation interacts with co 2 dynamics the conceptualization in fig 16 is relatively simplistic and it seems likely to grow in complexity as further sites are studied and more dimensions of the problem are understood importantly all of the sites discussed are dominated by autogenic recharge it seems plausible that sites dominated by allogenic recharge will display somewhat different dynamics for example ventilation may not bring water to a supersaturated state because dissolved load is always sufficiently low dilution may be more important however patterns of co 2 production and degassing have also been shown to control spatial patterns of dissolution within allogenically recharged systems covington et al 2013 here we have categorized each study site into a single pattern stage of fig 16 but most karst systems will contain a range of ventilation conditions within them therefore the presented stages may also represent spatial contrasts in dissolution rate dynamics within different portions of a karst system that have different ventilation strengths processes such as co 2 production ventilation and gas exchange are currently absent from numerical models of speleogenesis developing and exploring mathematical models for these processes would aid future understanding of the long term interactions among ventilation co 2 dynamics and calcite dissolution and how they influence the rates and patterns of cave development 6 conclusions we collected time series data from a stream cave in arkansas to study the temporal variation in calcite dissolution rates and the factors that drive them ventilation of the cave atmosphere is driven by external temperature changes through the process of chimney effect airflow the direction of air flow is the primary control on gaseous co 2 within the cave atmosphere with low co 2 during periods with updraft when the cave is effectively ventilated by outside air and high co 2 during periods of downdraft when outside air flows through a zone of high co 2 before entering the main cave passage in turn dissolved co 2 in the cave stream is strongly impacted by the concentration of co 2 in the cave atmosphere generating a seasonal variation in dissolved co 2 that emerges as the primary driver of dissolution rate variability within the cave stream dissolution rate is more strongly correlated with cave airflow direction than it is with discharge indicating that the standard framework of geomorphic work partitioned by flood stage is inappropriate for this site we also find that the variations of dissolution rates during individual storm events are modulated by airflow direction with more variation occurring during updraft winter conditions we compare the results from this study with prior studies of dissolution rate variability within karst systems and propose a preliminary framework to explain the different observed patterns of dissolution rate variation along an axis of increasing cave ventilation we suggest that the onset of ventilation reduces the rates of chemical erosion within karst systems and that as karst systems mature they will generally evolve toward greater ventilation and lower dissolution rates this effect may accentuate the importance of mechanical erosion during the later stages of cave evolution 7 data availability the data

4927,climate change has some important implications for soil resource and sediment loads of rivers which may affect sustainable food production and use of river for water supply the present study assessed the potential impacts of climate change on rainfall erosivity over iran climate change data from three gcms under two rcps 4 5 and 8 5 were statistically downscaled using the lars wg model regional r factor regression equations were applied to derive future rainfall erosivity the results of this study revealed that the average annual r factor for the observed data was 268 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 projections revealed that in the 2040 2060 period under rcp 4 5 except arid regions in the east other regions encompassing 66 1 of iran will experience an increase in the r factor by 2 5 22 5 mainly in the mountain areas in the north and northwest projections for rcp 4 5 in the period of 2060 2080 showed that in the arid zones in the southeast center and east of iran the rainfall erosivity will decrease however in rcp 8 5 an increase in rainfall will cause an increase in rainfall erosivity in most parts of iran the results also indicated that soil erosion and sediment load in the 2040 2060 period may have some serious implications therefore new strategies must be developed to attenuate the adverse effects of climate change on soil erosion and sediment deposition in reservoirs keywords climate change r factor rusle soil erosion random forest 1 introduction soil erosion caused by water is the most influential type of soil erosion which has immense impact on soil quality and productivity and sustainable agricultural production gericke et al 2019 sediment transported due to soil erosion could reduce reservoir lifetime and hydrological ecosystem services of rivers panagos et al 2015 in iran water erosion is one of the most common types of land degradation nearly 35 million hectares of iran is influenced by various forms of water erosion zakerinejad and maerker 2015 iran has invested heavily and built over 600 dams over the past three decades bathymetric surveys of 27 large dams of iran show that almost 132 7 million cubic meters sediment enters the dam reservoirs annually and this is in respect to the fact that iran has faced serious water crises for a long time sadeghi 2017 as a result the annual renewable water availability is now less than 2000 m3 per capita and it has been predicted that iran s total annual renewable water will reach approximately 1300 m3 per capita by 2021 edalat and abdi 2018 therefore dams have served a key purpose in the sustainable water management in iran temperature and precipitation pattern variations caused by global warming are expected to affect soil erosion and dam sedimentation duulatov et al 2019 gericke et al 2019 soil erosion can be affected by climate change both directly and indirectly based on the former the overall variations in the rainfall amount intensity spatial temporal distribution and increases in extreme precipitation are the main driving forces zhang et al 2010 gericke et al 2019 hoomehr et al 2016 while the latter includes reduction in soil moisture and plant growth caused by an increase in temperature direct fertilization effects on plants due to greater co2 concentration biomass production and change in the growing season gericke et al 2019 nearing 2001 shiono et al 2013 zhang et al 2010 the most direct effect of climate change on soil erosion is changes in rainfall erosivity due to changes in rainfall intensity rainfall erosivity is one of the most important indicators of soil erosion in the world which is related to kinetic energy of raindrops capra et al 2017 liu et al 2018 nearing et al 2017 panagos et al 2017b the rainfall erosivity factor r factor

precipitation data at high temporal resolution zhang et al 2010 studying the adverse impacts of climate change on soil erosion and sediment load is highly important worldwide many researches have been carried out to evaluate future changes in the r factor expected changes in rainfall erosivity due to climate change have been conducted in some watersheds in australia brazil china england india japan thailand and the united states almagro et al 2017 also many researches have evaluated future changes in the r factor in continental and country scale for the united states biasutti and seager 2015 nearing 2001 central asia duulatov et al 2019 and brazil almagro et al 2017 study results worldwide reveal that the spatial and temporal projection of future climate change on rainfall erosivity is site specific so far climate change impacts on rainfall erosivity have not been studied in iran therefore the main objective of this study was to project future spatial and temporal changes in rainfall erosivity based on the general circulation models gcms outputs over iran with this aim in mind we follow three steps 1 derive regression equations relating rainfall erosivity to monthly and annual rainfall in the homogeneous precipitation climate zones 2 create an r factor map using random forest rf machine learning algorithm to infer the spatial rainfall erosivity 3 project future spatial and temporal changes in rainfall erosivity using data from gcms under two representative concentration pathways rcps over iran 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area iran with an area of 1 648 000 km2 is located in the southwest of asia which lies between 25 00 n and 39 47 n in latitude and between 44 02 e and 63 20 e in longitude fig 1 iran is the second largest country in the middle east with heterogeneous geographic and climatic properties annual rainfall in different parts of iran varies from less than 100 mm in hyper arid climate in central regions to more than 1200 mm along the caspian coast in the north sadeghi et al 2017 rainfall variability in iran is caused by numerous factors such as the number of cyclones passing over iran and the variation in the synoptic system position modarres and da silva 2007 also alborz and zagros mountains in the north and the west cause unequal spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in iran dinpashoh et al 2004 2 2 computation of present rainfall erosivity rusle r factor is the product of kinetic energy of a rainfall event and its maximum 30 min intensity brown and foster 1987 eq 1 1 r 1 n j 1 n k 1 m j e i 30 k

obtain therefore various studies have aimed to derive regression equations for calculating the r factor from readily available rainfall data duulatov et al 2019 in iran various researchers have calculated the annual rainfall erosivity for pluviographic stations established by the iranian meteorological organization imo and iran water resources management company iwrmc also some studies have derived regional linear and exponential regression equations for the estimation of annual rainfall erosivity based on the annual rainfall or modified fournier index mfi arnoldus 1980 in this study the annual rainfall erosivity reported for 73 pluviographic stations and the regional equations were derived from literature over 40 local researches which had studied the r factor from rainfall intensity for more than 20 years empirical relationships of rainfall erosivity are location specific and the equations cannot be applied to larger areas plangoen and udmale 2017 hence in the present study the homogeneous precipitation climate zones of iran which were presented by dinpashoh et al 2004 were used in dinpashoh s research iran was divided into seven homogeneous precipitation zones after assessing the accuracy and reliability of the r factor relevant equations were used to calculate the r factor of rain gauge stations using monthly and annual rainfall for each zone table 1 in some of the seven zones the annual rainfall erosivity reported by several studies was combined to derive the final regression equation 2 3 climate change scenarios climate data of phase 5 pertaining to the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 from intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc was used to study the climate change impacts on rainfall erosivity in the present study the rainfall outputs from three climate models including hadley global environment model 2 earth system hadgem2 es model for interdisciplinary research on climate miroc5 and max planck institute for meteorology earth system model mpi esm mr under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 were selected to calculate the rainfall erosivity under climate change table 2 a spatial and temporal scale mismatch exists between climate models projections and point scale impact assessment of climate change murphy 1999 the spatial resolution of the gcms is often coarser than what is needed for assessing local impacts of climate change zhang et al 2010 also gcms have large biases that if not corrected can lead to significant errors in impact assessments to pass these hurdles several techniques were presented to downscale monthly precipitation of gcm projections at the scale of specific weather stations lars wg long ashton research station weather generator is a stochastic weather generator which can be used to downscale coarse spatial and temporal outputs from gcms to finer scale and generate weather data at a single site lars wg perturbed the observed daily time series by monthly changes representing the future scenarios of climate change in this study daily precipitation data from 82 weather stations operated by imo with minimum missing data and reliability of recorded data for at least 20 years were adopted and entered into the lars wg as observed data also lars wg was used to downscale the climate model outputs under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and generated 100 years of synthetic daily precipitation then the r factor was calculated using regional regression equations for gcm outputs under the two rcp scenarios for years 2040 2060 and 2060 2080 2 4 rainfall erosivity mapping due to spatial and temporal variability of the r factor in the study area using ordinary interpolating methods such as inverse distance weighting idw or simple kriging do not reveal optimal results therefore we took into account identifying relations between the r factor and other climatic variables which had better spatial resolution panagos et al 2015 2017b in this method a statistical relationship was found between the r factor which should be predicted and a set of spatially climatic covariates which were calculated through the use of machine learning approaches in recent years machine learning has proved to be of great assistance to researchers with the statistical interpolation techniques for environmental data appelhans et al 2015 he et al 2016 ho et al 2014 among the range of machine learning approaches random forest rf has indicated its superior performance in being applied to the spatial interpolation of environmental variables li et al 2011 rf is a nonparametric method which has the ability to tackle complex nonlinear relationships between variables while minimizing errors with overfitting and best performance he et al 2016 ließ et al 2012 pal 2005 peters et al 2007 the rf principle is to merge many binary decision trees produced using multiple bootstrap samples achieved from the learning sample and randomly selecting a proper subset of explanatory variables at each node genuer et al 2010 rf trains each individual tree on bootstrap resamples of the whole data set in comparison with the standard decision tree model which uses the entire data set and whose nodes are divided into different properties of all variables and the final outcome is decided based upon the average or majority voting for this purpose the random forest package in r with 2000 trees was used the statistical framework of rf considers a learning collection based on l x 1 y 1 x n y n made up of n i i d observations of a random vector x y friedman et al 2001 for more detailed mathematical formulation of the rf model refer to liaw and wiener 2002 and breiman 2001 the spatial interpolation of rainfall erosivity values was carried out on a regular grid of 4 5 km 2 5 min based on predictors derived from the set of 18 worldclim covariates the covariates used contained the annual mean temperature average annual precipitation average monthly precipitation average minimum and maximum monthly precipitation precipitation of the driest month precipitation of the wettest month precipitation of warmest quarter and precipitation of coldest quarter as defined in the worldclim database www worldclim org hijmans et al 2005 since elevation longitude and latitude had already been applied to calculate worldclim variables these variables were not entered into the model the variables of three separated periods were used that included current period 1970 2000 that was based on the interpolation of the observed data and two future periods 2040 2060 and 2060 2080 in the process of producing each map the rainfall erosivity dataset dependent variable of stations was randomly partitioned into subsets where 70 59 stations of the data were applied to calibrate the models and 30 24 stations were used for testing the performance of the final models was evaluated by coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse then considering the type of relationship between the amount of rainfall erosivity in the training stations and 18 climatic variables which were extracted from the worldclim maps a quantitative value was predicted for each pixel by rf 3 results and discussion 3 1 mapping of rainfall erosivity for the baseline period in the present study regional regression equations were used to calculate the r factor of rain gauge stations table 1 in zones a and f the average annual r factor of stations reported by previous studies was used to derive regional regression equations for some zones such as b and g extracting suitable equations for the whole zone was not possible therefore equations which relate annual rainfall or mfi to the annual r factor were applied the variability of rainfall properties and number of pluviographic stations were used to derive equations in these zones may be some of the reasons behind this selection zone b in the north of iran has the greatest annual rainfall of 486 mm which also has the maximum standard deviation of 337 mm also zone g has the least annual rainfall of 165 mm which varies from 78 mm to 318 mm among zones little rainfall and insufficient pluviographic stations in zone g may be some of the main reasons why suitable regional equations for the entire zone was not achievable table 3 shows importance of conditioning factors based on the rf model correlation between test data and projections for validation model revealed a good performance of the rf models table 4 as illustrated in table 3 precipitation in the months of january december and october were the three most influencing climate factors on the r factor value for the baseline climate period r2 and nse criteria for the final rf models revealed a good performance for test data table 4 fig 2 presents the annual erosivity map of iran which was derived through the use of rf models the average annual r factor for the observed data varies from 99 3 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 to 2149 4 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with a mean of 268 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and a standard deviation of 172 8 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the r factor map for the observed period shows that the greatest values are located in the north and west of the country and the lowest rainfall erosivity is mainly located in the central parts the spatial patterns of the highest erosivity values fig 2 are coincident with the corresponding patterns of the annual rainfall various national studies conducted by sadeghi et al 2011 zabihi et al 2015 and nikkami et al 2015 also affirm the same pattern in that the maximum r factor belonged to the stations in the north of iran and the lowest values were attributed to the arid lands in the central part of iran the mean r factor reported by nikkami et al 2015 is 308 23 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 which is in line with the obtained results through comparing the r factor map of iran with the global rainfall erosivity database gloreda by panagos et al 2017a an overall discrepancy was found while gloreda claims that the mean annual r factor for iran is 165 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 which varies from zero mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 12 of country to 3625 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 our results along with other local research results nikkami and mahdian 2015 zabihi et al 2015 sadeghi et al 2011 argue otherwise especially for upper and lower limits this discrepancy might be due to various factors such as the selected study scale the inter comparison of different time periods different algorithm for rainfall energy estimation and different interpolation models 3 2 rainfall erosivity under climate change future r factor values for each rain gauge station have been calculated by using regional regression equations and output rainfall of three gcms in 2040 2060 and 2060 2080 periods under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the r factor maps for rcps in 2040 2060 and 2060 2080 periods are demonstrated in fig 3 also in fig 4 percent change between bias corrected projections and baseline r factor is presented the r factor spatial statistics for iran in the historical period and projected for future is reported in table 5 the annual r factor for the 2040 2060 period in rcp 4 5 varies from 82 8 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 for hadgem2 es model to 2228 3 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 for micro c5 model with mean of 298 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 table 5 for the rcp 8 5 in the 2040 2060 period the minimum annual r factor is projected by 77 5 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 for mpi esm mr and the maximum annual r factor is projected by 2246 3 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 for micro c5 model the average r factor for this rcp is 268 4 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in the 2060 2080 period the mean r factor for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 are 255 4 and 276 3 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 respectively in the rcp 4 5 the minimum r factor projected by micro c5 64 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and the maximum r factor belongs to the hadgem2 es model 2107 5 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 while in the rcp 8 5 changes vary from 86 9 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 for the hadgem2 es to 2282 7 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in the micro c5 model the projected r factor changes for the models and scenarios as quantified by the standard deviation show that the results of hadgem2 es and micro c5 models for both rcps are greater than the baseline period table 5 this means that the annual rainfall variability and the r factor are increasing in the future the average climate models projection for the two rcps reveal that the maximum r factor in iran belongs to rcp 4 5 in the 2040 2060 period 297 8 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and the minimum value was projected for 2060 2080 in rcp 4 5 by 249 3 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the current results regarding rainfall erosivity are in accords with the rainfall projection by gcms the overall mean of models for both rcps show that iran will receive more precipitation in the 2040 2060 period rather than 2060 2080 table 5 the maximum increase in iran s annual rainfall has been projected for rcp 4 5 in 2040 2060 by 8 7 and the maximum decrease has been projected for rcp 4 5 in 2060 2080 by 3 14 other studies which project climate change over iran by using cmip5 data maintain that precipitation projection in rcp 4 5 is more than rcp 8 5 for midcentury vaghefi et al 2019 and the maximum decrease in rainfall was projected for the end of the century babaeian et al 2019 3 3 analysis rainfall erosivity under climate change by climate zones the mean r factor and percent change in all homogenous zones for the baseline and gcms in the 2040 2060 period are presented in table 6 based on the baseline data zone a has the least annual r factor by 157 9 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and zone b has the highest r factor by 431 5 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 projection of gcm ensembles show that in the period 2040 2060 in rcp 4 5 in every zone except zone g an increase in the r factor 2 5 24 4 is projected but for rcp 8 5 rainfall erosivity will decrease in most of the arid lands in zones e f and g 0 9 11 and will increase in wet zones including zones a b c and d by 1 5 19 8 the mean r factor and percent change for the 2060 2080 period displayed in table 7 indicates that in rcp 4 5 rainfall erosivity has increased in zones a b c d and e 1 8 18 5 and decreased in zones f and g 1 8 13 while in rcp 8 5 except zones c and d the r factor increases in all zones from 1 2 to 21 6 projected changes for the 2040 2060 period in zone a for both rcps show that all models project increase of rainfall erosivity for these years which varies from 1 5 to 27 7 also for the period of 2060 2070 except mpi esm mr in rcp 8 5 all models project increase in the r factor for zone a the projected change for zone b is almost the same as zone a in this zone except mpi esm mr and micro c5 all models project increase of the r factor in the future which ranges from 4 to 50 therefore based on our study results zones a and b will be faced with higher rainfall erosivity in the future in zone c except the micro c5 model increase in the r factor is projected for both rcps in the 2040 2060 period 4 12 to 30 30 in the 2060 2080 period three model scenarios project decrease of rainfall erosivity in rcp 8 5 the results of the hadgem2 es model show an increase of 23 2 for the r factor and the other two models predict decrease in the r factor by 17 and 27 in zone d for the period of 2040 2060 all models predict increase in the r factor for both rcps except the micro c5 in rcp 8 5 whereas in the 2060 2080 period mpi esm mr for both rcps and micro c5 in rcp 8 5 predict decrease in the r factor therefore probability of decrease in the r factor for the 2060 2080 period in rcp 8 5 is high in zone e for the 2040 2060 period decrease in the r facror only by micro c5 model for rcp 4 5 has been predicted whereas in rcp 8 5 results of micro c5 and hadgem2 es project decrease in the r values projections of models for the 2060 2080 period in rcp 4 5 reveal that except for mpi esm mr model the other two models show decrease in the raingfall erosivity 2 and 6 6 while in rcp 8 5 all models show increase 1 9 15 7 study results show that f and g zones have a similar situation in such a way that except hadgem2 es model the other two models have predicted decrease in the r factor from 18 3 to 6 5 in the 2040 2060 period also in the 2060 2080 for rcp 4 5 decrease in rainfall erosivity has been projected by the two models hadgem2 es and micro c5 in rcp 8 5 increase in the rainfall erosivity is predicted for zones g and f by micro c5 model hadgem2 es results for zone f shows a decrease by 29 and in zone f reveals an increase 17 6 overall the rainfall erosivity will decrease in rcp 8 5 of the 2040 2060 period and rcp 4 5 in the 2060 2080 period also under rcp 8 5 in the 2060 2080 period increase of rainfall erosivity is predicted in zones f and g the spatial patterns in the rainfall erosivity changes in percentage between the mean downscaled gcm projections relative to the baseline period from multimodel and rcps is presented in fig 4 also the location of reservoirs with the capacity of more than 10 million m3 is presented in fig 4 the multimodal averaged relative change in the r factor for the 2040 2060 period indicate that in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 33 9 and 55 8 of iran will experience decrease in rainfall erosivity respectively and less than 1 of the country area in the northeast and southeast will experience decrease greater than 50 in the r factor fig 5 areas with increase in the r factor in the 2040 2060 period accounted for 66 1 and 44 2 of the country which reveal increase in the rainfall erosivity mainly in the mountainous regions in the north and northwest for about 53 and 35 7 of the country area relative changes less than 50 have been projected for the two rcps respectively and the area with more than 50 change are 13 1 and 8 6 for the aforementioned rcps all in all the study results for the 2040 2060 period indicate that the extent of area with increase in the r factor in rcp 4 5 is considerable but in rcp 8 5 decrease in the r factor has been projected for most parts of the central parts of iran due to decrease in the annual rainfall fig 6 projections of gcms for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 indicates that rainfall erosivity in 60 and 45 4 of iran will decrease for the 2060 2080 period which has a spatial pattern similar to the 2040 2060 period fig 5 also for 54 5 and 40 of the country increase in the r factor has been projected for the two rcps this means that soil erosion by water will be a serious problem for almost half of country especially the highlands of the north and the northwest by the end of the century 4 conclusions the present study assessed the potential impacts of climate change on rainfall erosivity over iran using multi gcms and two greenhouse emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 to this aim lars wg as a stochastic weather generator was used to downscale weather data at a single station the regression equations which relate the r factor values to rainfall properties were applied to derive the future rainfall erosivity in homogenous precipitation climate zones the results of this study revealed that the average annual r factor for the observed data was 268 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 projection results for the future showed that the maximum r factor belonged to rcp 4 5 in the 2040 2060 period 299 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and the minimum value was projected for the 2060 2080 in rcp 4 5 by 255 4 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 projections revealed that in the 2040 2060 period under rcp 4 5 except zone g which covered arid regions in the east of iran other regions experienced increase in the r factor by 2 5 to 22 5 in rcp 8 5 due to less rainfall projection the extent of area with decreased rainfall erosivity was extended to arid lands in the central and eastern parts of iran zones e f and g the level and extent of changes depended on the rcps the area with increase in the r factor in rcp 4 5 was more than rcp 8 5 due to increase in the annual rainfall gcms projections for rcp 4 5 in the period of 2040 2080 showed that in the arid zones in the southeast center and east of iran the rainfall erosivity will decrease however in rcp 8 5 increase in rainfall will cause increase in rainfall erosivity in most parts of iran climate projections for the 2060 2080 period revealed that the rainfall erosivity will decrease over iran so that except mountainous regions in the northern and western parts of iran the r factor will decrease by 8 to 28 also in rcp 8 5 decrease was projected for the western part of the country however in wet regions increase in rainfall erosivity was projected for all rcps in the future the overall study results revealed that in the 2040 2060 period iran will experience wet climate and increase in rainfall especially in the north and northwest in which alborz and zagros mountain chains are located these areas with high precipitation are of great importance in supplying water for various purposes therefore in recent decades high investment has been made in dam construction so that 76 of the dams with more than 10 million m3 capacity are constructed in these areas zones a b c d these dams have been constructed for multiple purposes such as water supply for agriculture supplying drinking water industrial use and flood control however it seems that soil erosion and sediment load in the 2040 2060 period will prove to be a great challenge increase in rainfall erosivity may have some serious implications causing increase in soil erosion and sediment deposits in the downstream dams and channels in the future therefore new strategies must be developed to attenuate the adverse effects of soil erosion and sediment deposition in reservoirs the results of this study are expected to assist development planners and decision makers regarding the design and implementation of suitable soil erosion control plans to adapt with the anticipated climate change in the end it is worth pointing out that the present results were faced with some limitations and uncertainty one key assumption in the present study was that regional equations for the observed data will be constant for the future in addition rainfall erosivity is only a function of rainfall amount whereas climate change may affect rainfall erosivity via change in type or intensity of precipitation using different methods for calculation of the r factor in the stations low number of pluviographic stations in some arid lands difference in length of period for calculation of the factor are other uncertainties in this research therefore further study is required to take into account the aforementioned limitations credit authorship contribution statement mahmood azari conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing

4927,climate change has some important implications for soil resource and sediment loads of rivers which may affect sustainable food production and use of river for water supply the present study assessed the potential impacts of climate change on rainfall erosivity over iran climate change data from three gcms under two rcps 4 5 and 8 5 were statistically downscaled using the lars wg model regional r factor regression equations were applied to derive future rainfall erosivity the results of this study revealed that the average annual r factor for the observed data was 268 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 projections revealed that in the 2040 2060 period under rcp 4 5 except arid regions in the east other regions encompassing 66 1 of iran will experience an increase in the r factor by 2 5 22 5 mainly in the mountain areas in the north and northwest projections for rcp 4 5 in the period of 2060 2080 showed that in the arid zones in the southeast center and east of iran the rainfall erosivity will decrease however in rcp 8 5 an increase in rainfall will cause an increase in rainfall erosivity in most parts of iran the results also indicated that soil erosion and sediment load in the 2040 2060 period may have some serious implications therefore new strategies must be developed to attenuate the adverse effects of climate change on soil erosion and sediment deposition in reservoirs keywords climate change r factor rusle soil erosion random forest 1 introduction soil erosion caused by water is the most influential type of soil erosion which has immense impact on soil quality and productivity and sustainable agricultural production gericke et al 2019 sediment transported due to soil erosion could reduce reservoir lifetime and hydrological ecosystem services of rivers panagos et al 2015 in iran water erosion is one of the most common types of land degradation nearly 35 million hectares of iran is influenced by various forms of water erosion zakerinejad and maerker 2015 iran has invested heavily and built over 600 dams over the past three decades bathymetric surveys of 27 large dams of iran show that almost 132 7 million cubic meters sediment enters the dam reservoirs annually and this is in respect to the fact that iran has faced serious water crises for a long time sadeghi 2017 as a result the annual renewable water availability is now less than 2000 m3 per capita and it has been predicted that iran s total annual renewable water will reach approximately 1300 m3 per capita by 2021 edalat and abdi 2018 therefore dams have served a key purpose in the sustainable water management in iran temperature and precipitation pattern variations caused by global warming are expected to affect soil erosion and dam sedimentation duulatov et al 2019 gericke et al 2019 soil erosion can be affected by climate change both directly and indirectly based on the former the overall variations in the rainfall amount intensity spatial temporal distribution and increases in extreme precipitation are the main driving forces zhang et al 2010 gericke et al 2019 hoomehr et al 2016 while the latter includes reduction in soil moisture and plant growth caused by an increase in temperature direct fertilization effects on plants due to greater co2 concentration biomass production and change in the growing season gericke et al 2019 nearing 2001 shiono et al 2013 zhang et al 2010 the most direct effect of climate change on soil erosion is changes in rainfall erosivity due to changes in rainfall intensity rainfall erosivity is one of the most important indicators of soil erosion in the world which is related to kinetic energy of raindrops capra et al 2017 liu et al 2018 nearing et al 2017 panagos et al 2017b the rainfall erosivity factor r factor for a given storm in the universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1978 or its revision rusle revised usle renard et al 1997 is defined as the long term average product of total rainfall energy and maximum precipitation intensity over 30 min ei30 for storm events duulatov et al 2019 the r factor is defined as the average annual sum of ei30 calculated from long time series of precipitation data at high temporal resolution zhang et al 2010 studying the adverse impacts of climate change on soil erosion and sediment load is highly important worldwide many researches have been carried out to evaluate future changes in the r factor expected changes in rainfall erosivity due to climate change have been conducted in some watersheds in australia brazil china england india japan thailand and the united states almagro et al 2017 also many researches have evaluated future changes in the r factor in continental and country scale for the united states biasutti and seager 2015 nearing 2001 central asia duulatov et al 2019 and brazil almagro et al 2017 study results worldwide reveal that the spatial and temporal projection of future climate change on rainfall erosivity is site specific so far climate change impacts on rainfall erosivity have not been studied in iran therefore the main objective of this study was to project future spatial and temporal changes in rainfall erosivity based on the general circulation models gcms outputs over iran with this aim in mind we follow three steps 1 derive regression equations relating rainfall erosivity to monthly and annual rainfall in the homogeneous precipitation climate zones 2 create an r factor map using random forest rf machine learning algorithm to infer the spatial rainfall erosivity 3 project future spatial and temporal changes in rainfall erosivity using data from gcms under two representative concentration pathways rcps over iran 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area iran with an area of 1 648 000 km2 is located in the southwest of asia which lies between 25 00 n and 39 47 n in latitude and between 44 02 e and 63 20 e in longitude fig 1 iran is the second largest country in the middle east with heterogeneous geographic and climatic properties annual rainfall in different parts of iran varies from less than 100 mm in hyper arid climate in central regions to more than 1200 mm along the caspian coast in the north sadeghi et al 2017 rainfall variability in iran is caused by numerous factors such as the number of cyclones passing over iran and the variation in the synoptic system position modarres and da silva 2007 also alborz and zagros mountains in the north and the west cause unequal spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in iran dinpashoh et al 2004 2 2 computation of present rainfall erosivity rusle r factor is the product of kinetic energy of a rainfall event and its maximum 30 min intensity brown and foster 1987 eq 1 1 r 1 n j 1 n k 1 m j e i 30 k where r is the average annual rainfall erosivity mjmmha 1 h 1 yr 1 n is the number of years and mj is the number of erosive storms in a given year j and ei30 is the rainfall erosivity index of a

rainfall intensity during the time interval mm h 1 3 e r 0 29 1 0 72 e x p 0 05 i r in many parts of the world the rainfall intensity required for calculating the r factor is usually difficult to obtain therefore various studies have aimed to derive regression equations for calculating the r factor from readily available rainfall data duulatov et al 2019 in iran various researchers have calculated the annual rainfall erosivity for pluviographic stations established by the iranian meteorological organization imo and iran water resources management company iwrmc also some studies have derived regional linear and exponential regression equations for the estimation of annual rainfall erosivity based on the annual rainfall or modified fournier index mfi arnoldus 1980 in this study the annual rainfall erosivity reported for 73 pluviographic stations and the regional equations were derived from literature over 40 local researches which had studied the r factor from rainfall intensity for more than 20 years empirical relationships of rainfall erosivity are location specific and the equations cannot be applied to larger areas plangoen and udmale 2017 hence in the present study the homogeneous precipitation climate zones of iran which were presented by dinpashoh et al 2004 were used in dinpashoh s research iran was divided into seven homogeneous precipitation zones after assessing the accuracy and reliability of the r factor relevant equations were used to calculate the r factor of rain gauge stations using monthly and annual rainfall for each zone table 1 in some of the seven zones the annual rainfall erosivity reported by several studies was combined to derive the final regression equation 2 3 climate change scenarios climate data of phase 5 pertaining to the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 from intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc was used to study the climate change impacts on rainfall erosivity in the present study the rainfall outputs from three climate models including hadley global environment model 2 earth system hadgem2 es model for interdisciplinary research on climate miroc5 and max planck institute for meteorology earth system model mpi esm mr under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 were selected to calculate the rainfall erosivity under climate change table 2 a spatial and temporal scale mismatch exists between climate models projections and point scale impact assessment of climate change murphy 1999 the spatial resolution of the gcms is often coarser than what is needed for assessing local impacts of climate change zhang et al 2010 also gcms have large biases that if not corrected can lead to significant errors in impact assessments to pass these hurdles several techniques were presented to downscale monthly precipitation of gcm projections at the scale of specific weather stations lars wg long ashton research station weather generator is a stochastic weather generator which can be used to downscale coarse spatial and temporal outputs from gcms to finer scale and generate weather data at a single site lars wg perturbed the observed daily time series by monthly changes representing the future scenarios of climate change in this study daily precipitation data from 82 weather stations operated by imo with minimum missing data and reliability of recorded data for at least 20 years were adopted and entered into the lars wg as observed data also lars wg was used to downscale the climate model outputs under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and generated 100 years of synthetic daily precipitation then the r factor was calculated using regional regression equations for gcm outputs under the two rcp scenarios for years 2040 2060 and 2060 2080 2 4 rainfall erosivity mapping due to spatial and temporal variability of the r factor in the study area using ordinary interpolating methods such as inverse distance weighting idw or simple kriging do not reveal optimal results therefore we took into account identifying relations between the r factor and other climatic variables which had better spatial resolution panagos et al 2015 2017b in this method a statistical relationship was found between the r factor which should be predicted and a set of spatially climatic covariates which were calculated through the use of machine learning approaches in recent years machine learning has proved to be of great assistance to researchers with the statistical interpolation techniques for environmental data appelhans et al 2015 he et al 2016 ho et al 2014 among the range of machine learning approaches random forest rf has indicated its superior performance in being applied to the spatial interpolation of environmental variables li et al 2011 rf is a nonparametric method which has the ability to tackle complex nonlinear relationships between variables while minimizing errors with overfitting and best performance he et al 2016 ließ et al 2012 pal 2005 peters et al 2007 the rf principle is to merge many binary decision trees produced using multiple bootstrap samples achieved from the learning sample and randomly selecting a proper subset of explanatory variables at each node genuer et al 2010 rf trains each individual tree on bootstrap resamples of the whole data set in comparison with the standard decision tree model which uses the entire data set and whose nodes are divided into different properties of all variables and the final outcome is decided based upon the average or majority voting for this purpose the random forest package in r with 2000 trees was used the statistical framework of rf considers a learning collection based on l x 1 y 1 x n y n made up of n i i d observations of a random vector x y friedman et al 2001 for more detailed mathematical formulation of the rf model refer to liaw and wiener 2002 and breiman 2001 the spatial interpolation of rainfall erosivity values was carried out on a regular grid of 4 5 km 2 5 min based on predictors derived from the set of 18 worldclim covariates the covariates used contained the annual mean temperature average annual precipitation average monthly precipitation average minimum and maximum monthly precipitation precipitation of the driest month precipitation of the wettest month precipitation of warmest quarter and precipitation of coldest quarter as defined in the worldclim database www worldclim org hijmans et al 2005 since elevation longitude and latitude had already been applied to calculate worldclim variables these variables were not entered into the model the variables of three separated periods were used that included current period 1970 2000 that was based on the interpolation of the observed data and two future periods 2040 2060 and 2060 2080 in the process of producing each map the rainfall erosivity dataset dependent variable of stations was randomly partitioned into subsets where 70 59 stations of the data were applied to calibrate the models and 30 24 stations were used for testing the performance of the final models was evaluated by coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse then considering the type of relationship between the amount of rainfall erosivity in the training stations and 18 climatic variables which were extracted from the worldclim maps a quantitative value was predicted for each pixel by rf 3 results and discussion 3 1 mapping of rainfall erosivity for the baseline period in the present study regional regression equations were used to calculate the r factor of rain gauge stations table 1 in zones a and f the average annual r factor of stations reported by previous studies was used to derive regional regression equations for some zones such as b and g extracting suitable equations for the whole zone was not possible therefore equations which relate annual rainfall or mfi to the annual r factor were applied the variability of rainfall properties and number of pluviographic stations were used to derive equations in these zones may be some of the reasons behind this selection zone b in the north of iran has the greatest annual rainfall of 486 mm which also has the maximum standard deviation of 337 mm also zone g has the least annual rainfall of 165 mm which varies from 78 mm to 318 mm among zones little rainfall and insufficient pluviographic stations in zone g may be some of the main reasons why suitable regional equations for the entire zone was not achievable table 3 shows importance of conditioning factors based on the rf model correlation between test data and projections for validation model revealed a good performance of the rf models table 4 as illustrated in table 3 precipitation in the months of january december and october were the three most influencing climate factors on the r factor value for the baseline climate period r2 and nse criteria for the final rf models revealed a good performance for test data table 4 fig 2 presents the annual erosivity map of iran which was derived through the use of rf models the average annual r factor for the observed data varies from 99 3 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 to 2149 4 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with a mean of 268 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and a standard deviation of 172 8 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the r factor map for the observed period shows that the greatest values are located in the north and west of the country and the lowest rainfall erosivity is mainly located in the central parts the spatial patterns of the highest erosivity values fig 2 are coincident with the corresponding patterns of the annual rainfall various national studies conducted by sadeghi et al 2011 zabihi et al 2015 and nikkami et al 2015 also affirm the same pattern in that the maximum r factor belonged to the stations in the north of iran and the lowest values were attributed to the arid lands in the central part of iran the mean r factor reported by nikkami et al 2015 is 308 23 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 which is in line with the obtained results through comparing the r factor map of iran with the global rainfall erosivity database gloreda by panagos et al 2017a an overall discrepancy was found while gloreda claims that the mean annual r factor for iran is 165 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 which varies from zero mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 12 of country to 3625 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 our results along with other local research results nikkami and mahdian 2015 zabihi et al 2015 sadeghi et al 2011 argue otherwise especially for upper and lower limits this discrepancy might be due to various factors such as the selected study scale the inter comparison of different time periods different algorithm for rainfall energy estimation and different interpolation models 3 2 rainfall erosivity under climate change future r factor values for each rain gauge station have been calculated by using regional regression equations and output rainfall of three gcms in 2040 2060 and 2060 2080 periods under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the r factor maps for rcps in 2040 2060 and 2060 2080 periods are demonstrated in fig 3 also in fig 4 percent change between bias corrected projections and baseline r factor is presented the r factor spatial statistics for iran in the historical period and projected for future is reported in table 5 the annual r factor for the 2040 2060 period in rcp 4 5 varies from 82 8 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 for hadgem2 es model to 2228 3 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 for micro c5 model with mean of 298 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 table 5 for the rcp 8 5 in the 2040 2060 period the minimum annual r factor is projected by 77 5 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 for mpi esm mr and the maximum annual r factor is projected by 2246 3 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 for micro c5 model the average r factor for this rcp is 268 4 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in the 2060 2080 period the mean r factor for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 are 255 4 and 276 3 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 respectively in the rcp 4 5 the minimum r factor projected by micro c5 64 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and the maximum r factor belongs to the hadgem2 es model 2107 5 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 while in the rcp 8 5 changes vary from 86 9 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 for the hadgem2 es to 2282 7 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in the micro c5 model the projected r factor changes for the models and scenarios as quantified by the standard deviation show that the results of hadgem2 es and micro c5 models for both rcps are greater than the baseline period table 5 this means that the annual rainfall variability and the r factor are increasing in the future the average climate models projection for the two rcps reveal that the maximum r factor in iran belongs to rcp 4 5 in the 2040 2060 period 297 8 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and the minimum value was projected for 2060 2080 in rcp 4 5 by 249 3 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the current results regarding rainfall erosivity are in accords with the rainfall projection by gcms the overall mean of models for both rcps show that iran will receive more precipitation in the 2040 2060 period rather than 2060 2080 table 5 the maximum increase in iran s annual rainfall has been projected for rcp 4 5 in 2040 2060 by 8 7 and the maximum decrease has been projected for rcp 4 5 in 2060 2080 by 3 14 other studies which project climate change over iran by using cmip5 data maintain that precipitation projection in rcp 4 5 is more than rcp 8 5 for midcentury vaghefi et al 2019 and the maximum decrease in rainfall was projected for the end of the century babaeian et al 2019 3 3 analysis rainfall erosivity under climate change by climate zones the mean r factor and percent change in all homogenous zones for the baseline and gcms in the 2040 2060 period are presented in table 6 based on the baseline data zone a has the least annual r factor by 157 9 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and zone b has the highest r factor by 431 5 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 projection of gcm ensembles show that in the period 2040 2060 in rcp 4 5 in every zone except zone g an increase in the r factor 2 5 24 4 is projected but for rcp 8 5 rainfall erosivity will decrease in most of the arid lands in zones e f and g 0 9 11 and will increase in wet zones including zones a b c and d by 1 5 19 8 the mean r factor and percent change for the 2060 2080 period displayed in table 7 indicates that in rcp 4 5 rainfall erosivity has increased in zones a b c d and e 1 8 18 5 and decreased in zones f and g 1 8 13 while in rcp 8 5 except zones c and d the r factor increases in all zones from 1 2 to 21 6 projected changes for the 2040 2060 period in zone a for both rcps show that all models project increase of rainfall erosivity for these years which varies from 1 5 to 27 7 also for the period of 2060 2070 except mpi esm mr in rcp 8 5 all models project increase in the r factor for zone a the projected change for zone b is almost the same as zone a in this zone except mpi esm mr and micro c5 all models project increase of the r factor in the future which ranges from 4 to 50 therefore based on our study results zones a and b will be faced with higher rainfall erosivity in the future in zone c except the micro c5 model increase in the r factor is projected for both rcps in the 2040 2060 period 4 12 to 30 30 in the 2060 2080 period three model scenarios project decrease of rainfall erosivity in rcp 8 5 the results of the hadgem2 es model show an increase of 23 2 for the r factor and the other two models predict decrease in the r factor by 17 and 27 in zone d for the period of 2040 2060 all models predict increase in the r factor for both rcps except the micro c5 in rcp 8 5 whereas in the 2060 2080 period mpi esm mr for both rcps and micro c5 in rcp 8 5 predict decrease in the r factor therefore probability of decrease in the r factor for the 2060 2080 period in rcp 8 5 is high in zone e for the 2040 2060 period decrease in the r facror only by micro c5 model for rcp 4 5 has been predicted whereas in rcp 8 5 results of micro c5 and hadgem2 es project decrease in the r values projections of models for the 2060 2080 period in rcp 4 5 reveal that except for mpi esm mr model the other two models show decrease in the raingfall erosivity 2 and 6 6 while in rcp 8 5 all models show increase 1 9 15 7 study results show that f and g zones have a similar situation in such a way that except hadgem2 es model the other two models have predicted decrease in the r factor from 18 3 to 6 5 in the 2040 2060 period also in the 2060 2080 for rcp 4 5 decrease in rainfall erosivity has been projected by the two models hadgem2 es and micro c5 in rcp 8 5 increase in the rainfall erosivity is predicted for zones g and f by micro c5 model hadgem2 es results for zone f shows a decrease by 29 and in zone f reveals an increase 17 6 overall the rainfall erosivity will decrease in rcp 8 5 of the 2040 2060 period and rcp 4 5 in the 2060 2080 period also under rcp 8 5 in the 2060 2080 period increase of rainfall erosivity is predicted in zones f and g the spatial patterns in the rainfall erosivity changes in percentage between the mean downscaled gcm projections relative to the baseline period from multimodel and rcps is presented in fig 4 also the location of reservoirs with the capacity of more than 10 million m3 is presented in fig 4 the multimodal averaged relative change in the r factor for the 2040 2060 period indicate that in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 33 9 and 55 8 of iran will experience decrease in rainfall erosivity respectively and less than 1 of the country area in the northeast and southeast will experience decrease greater than 50 in the r factor fig 5 areas with increase in the r factor in the 2040 2060 period accounted for 66 1 and 44 2 of the country which reveal increase in the rainfall erosivity mainly in the mountainous regions in the north and northwest for about 53 and 35 7 of the country area relative changes less than 50 have been projected for the two rcps respectively and the area with more than 50 change are 13 1 and 8 6 for the aforementioned rcps all in all the study results for the 2040 2060 period indicate that the extent of area with increase in the r factor in rcp 4 5 is considerable but in rcp 8 5 decrease in the r factor has been projected for most parts of the central parts of iran due to decrease in the annual rainfall fig 6 projections of gcms for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 indicates that rainfall erosivity in 60 and 45 4 of iran will decrease for the 2060 2080 period which has a spatial pattern similar to the 2040 2060 period fig 5 also for 54 5 and 40 of the country increase in the r factor has been projected for the two rcps this means that soil erosion by water will be a serious problem for almost half of country especially the highlands of the north and the northwest by the end of the century 4 conclusions the present study assessed the potential impacts of climate change on rainfall erosivity over iran using multi gcms and two greenhouse emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 to this aim lars wg as a stochastic weather generator was used to downscale weather data at a single station the regression equations which relate the r factor values to rainfall properties were applied to derive the future rainfall erosivity in homogenous precipitation climate zones the results of this study revealed that the average annual r factor for the observed data was 268 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 projection results for the future showed that the maximum r factor belonged to rcp 4 5 in the 2040 2060 period 299 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and the minimum value was projected for the 2060 2080 in rcp 4 5 by 255 4 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 projections revealed that in the 2040 2060 period under rcp 4 5 except zone g which covered arid regions in the east of iran other regions experienced increase in the r factor by 2 5 to 22 5 in rcp 8 5 due to less rainfall projection the extent of area with decreased rainfall erosivity was extended to arid lands in the central and eastern parts of iran zones e f and g the level and extent of changes depended on the rcps the area with increase in the r factor in rcp 4 5 was more than rcp 8 5 due to increase in the annual rainfall gcms projections for rcp 4 5 in the period of 2040 2080 showed that in the arid zones in the southeast center and east of iran the rainfall erosivity will decrease however in rcp 8 5 increase in rainfall will cause increase in rainfall erosivity in most parts of iran climate projections for the 2060 2080 period revealed that the rainfall erosivity will decrease over iran so that except mountainous regions in the northern and western parts of iran the r factor will decrease by 8 to 28 also in rcp 8 5 decrease was projected for the western part of the country however in wet regions increase in rainfall erosivity was projected for all rcps in the future the overall study results revealed that in the 2040 2060 period iran will experience wet climate and increase in rainfall especially in the north and northwest in which alborz and zagros mountain chains are located these areas with high precipitation are of great importance in supplying water for various purposes therefore in recent decades high investment has been made in dam construction so that 76 of the dams with more than 10 million m3 capacity are constructed in these areas zones a b c d these dams have been constructed for multiple purposes such as water supply for agriculture supplying drinking water industrial use and flood control however it seems that soil erosion and sediment load in the 2040 2060 period will prove to be a great challenge increase in rainfall erosivity may have some serious implications causing increase in soil erosion and sediment deposits in the downstream dams and channels in the future therefore new strategies must be developed to attenuate the adverse effects of soil erosion and sediment deposition in reservoirs the results of this study are expected to assist development planners and decision makers regarding the design and implementation of suitable soil erosion control plans to adapt with the anticipated climate change in the end it is worth pointing out that the present results were faced with some limitations and uncertainty one key assumption in the present study was that regional equations for the observed data will be constant for the future in addition rainfall erosivity is only a function of rainfall amount whereas climate change may affect rainfall erosivity via change in type or intensity of precipitation using different methods for calculation of the r factor in the stations low number of pluviographic stations in some arid lands difference in length of period for calculation of the factor are other uncertainties in this research therefore further study is required to take into account the aforementioned limitations credit authorship contribution statement mahmood azari conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing

4928,the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide c o 2 concentration is changing plant physiology thus affecting terrestrial hydrological response a nonlinear stomatal conductance response to carbon dioxide concentration g s c o 2 was incorporated in the vic model for better representation of the evapotranspiration et response to the elevated c o 2 the annual et of maize and wheat over the agricultural land in northwest china was found to decrease by 0 54 and 0 21 during 1980 2010 respectively under doubled c o 2 concentration 660 ppm the et reduction of maize and wheat was 23 3 mm and 8 9 mm which accounted for 4 3 and 1 8 of the corresponding annual et the annual et reduction of maize under the four future scenarios rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s and rcp8 5 2080s was about 1 1 6 4 resulted from an ensemble mean of eight general circulation models the effects of elevated c o 2 offset part of et increase caused by the precipitation and temperature changes this study has practical implications for precise irrigation the et response of maize should be paid more attention for its larger potential in saving irrigation water for the studied region the elevated c o 2 concentration will be beneficial for saving irrigation water to a certain degree keywords carbon dioxide maize modified vic model evapotranspiration agricultural land 1 introduction the atmospheric carbon dioxide c o 2 concentration is rising rapidly due to the burning of fossil fuels the development of industry intensifying agriculture and the increasing population ipcc 2013 current c o 2 concentration is higher by almost 40 compared to the period of pre industrialization and will continue to rise in the future four representative concentration pathways for greenhouse gas emissions in future climates were proposed in the fifth assessment report ar5 namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 rcp8 5 and the prescribed c o 2 concentrations will reach 421 ppm parts per million 538 ppm 670 ppm and 936 ppm by the year 2100 respectively ipcc 2013 the elevated c o 2 concentration is accompanied by not only the greenhouse effect but also its direct and indirect impacts on agriculture and hydrology cheng et al 2014 mooney and koch 1994 morison 1987 the elevated c o 2 concentration exerts great impacts on the characteristics of the underlying surface by altering the plant growth which is inherently tied to the hydrological cycle ficklin et al 2009 plant physiology such as photosynthesis and transpiration has been altered due to c o 2 enrichment some related plant physiological structures are then changed accordingly to accommodate the natural environment for instance reflected by leaf area index l a i and stomatal conductance g s the changes in l a i and g s consequently affect the hydrological elements evapotranspiration runoff soil moisture etc in the process of the water cycle reddy et al 2010 evapotranspiration et is particularly subjected to the change in l a i and g s the stoma is the main channel for plants to dissipate water and exchange gas with the atmosphere the g s is reduced and relational transpiration are weakened under elevated c o 2 thereby plant et declines field et al 1995 hungate et al 2002 kang et al 1997 pan et al 2015 meanwhile photosynthetic rate and water use efficiency is improved due to elevated c o 2 lenka et al 2020 qi et al 2015 ziska et al 1990 making a larger leaf area which enhances et the elevated c o 2 concentration has both promoting and inhibiting effects on et in the past many experiments have been conducted such as either in a growth chamber li et al 2019 qiao et al 2010 or in free air c o 2 enrichment face kimball et al 1999 2002 triggs et al 2004 to assess the effects of elevated c o 2 concentration on et these experiments concluded that et will decrease to some extent with the combination of two factors g s l a i based on the experimental results many scholars further quantified the response of g s to c o 2 g s c o 2 l a i to c o 2 l a i c o 2 easterling et al 1992 medlyn et al 2001 morison 1987 pritchard et al 1999 wand et al 1999 li et al 2019 which enabled relevant studies on hydrological response to elevated c o 2 to be carried out extensively morison 1987 introduced a linear g s c o 2 relationship in the erosion productivity impact calculator model epic easterling et al 1992 to account for c o 2 enrichment by compiling plant physiological data from the literature on the plant response to elevated c o 2 eckhaedt and ulbrich 2003 incorporated the linear g s c o 2 and l a i c o 2 functions into the soil and water assessment tool swat model many studies have been conducted to investigate et runoff and crop growth under historical and future climate change by applying the linear relationship niu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2012 under doubled c o 2 concentration 660 ppm the et in the upper mississippi river basin was reduced by 11 wu et al 2012 a 3 16 et reduction due to doubled c o 2 was also found in the xijiang river basin niu et al 2013 in their studies linear responses of both g s and l a i to c o 2 are structured and incorporated into hydrological models to analyze the regional hydrological response however the linear g s c o 2 relationship is limited to the case where the c o 2 concentration is less than 660 ppm morison 1987 pritchard et al 1999 yet the c o 2 concentration will possibly exceed 660 ppm under the projected future scenarios as reported by ar5 which means the applicability of the linear model for the future can t be guaranteed a nonlinear g s c o 2 relationship was opportunely proposed by li et al 2019 to expand the applicability when c o 2 concentration is high li et al 2019 summarized the data in 50 representative journal articles and obtained the nonlinear response relationship of g s c o 2 by the least square method the nonlinear g s c o 2 relationship was further validated by experimental data and the results proved that the nonlinear model was superior to other models regarding et simulation the rapid increase in c o 2 concentration will inevitably lead to changes in et as a key process in the hydrological cycle et plays a vital role in plant water consumption accurate et estimations are essential to both the hydrological cycle and agricultural irrigation activities liu et al 2020 the et reduction caused by elevated c o 2 has been reported by both experimental results and numerical modeling burkart et al 2011 wu et al 2012 niu et al 2013 however most of them focused on the natural hydrological response the research scope can be extended to the response of crop et in agricultural land due to the frequent human activities such as farming and irrigation the response of crop et under elevated c o 2 and the associated changes in irrigation water requirement will impose more impact on the regional hydrological cycle zou et al 2020 so the et response over agricultural land has more important implications for regional water resources management xiao et al 2020 the agricultural land in northwest china which is one of the ten largest commodity grain bases nationally is confronted with deficient water resources it is located in an arid region where rainfall is extremely limited while the sufficient sunlight and suitable temperature make it possible to plant various crops the contradiction between huge irrigation demands and scarce water resources has become a factor restricting regional development liu et al 2017b studying the crop et response under the elevated c o 2 concentration namely the change of crop water consumption can provide reference and basis for agricultural production and regional water management which is of great significance for the sustainable development of regional society and economy especially under the changing climate chen et al 2019 kang et al 2017 to explore the effects of elevated c o 2 on et over agricultural land one of the large scale hydrological models the variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 model was modified to better represent et response under the influence of g s c o 2 and l a i c o 2 the l a i c o 2 and g s c o 2 relationships were embedded in the vic model to study the et response over agricultural land more comprehensively both the nonlinear g s c o 2 and the linear g s c o 2 relationship were incorporated into the vic model respectively for validating the better g s c o 2 model in this study fig 1 the et response of two dominant crops in the agricultural land maize and wheat were investigated for quantifying the effects of elevated c o 2 under the historical period 1980 2010 and future scenarios 2020 2100 eight general circulation models gcms were adopted for a more comprehensive analysis two rcps rcp4 5 rcp8 5 were considered to account for c o 2 concentration change under projected future scenarios the objectives of this study are 1 to improve the capability of the vic model to simulate et 2 to calculate and analyze the et response of two crops in the agricultural land under the historical period and future scenarios 3 to provide support for agricultural irrigation under elevated c o 2 concentration 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the agricultural land is located in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin as shown by the red frame in fig 2 the heihe river basin lies in the middle part of the hexi corridor in northwest china it is the second largest inland river basin in china with a total area of 11 6 104 square kilometers niu et al 2018 the middle reaches of the heihe river basin with an elevation range of 1300 1700 m zhu et al 2008 are a vast plain area about 2 56 104 square kilometers with abundant light and heat resources the soil types mainly include silt loam sandy loam loam and loam sandy soil zhao et al 2010 the annual sunshine time ranges from 3000 to 4000 h and the annual average temperature ranges from 6 to 8 c making an ideal area for agricultural production nearly 98 of the farmland in the basin is concentrated in the middle reaches chen et al 2018 however the heihe river basin is also a typical arid and semi arid climate zone with annual precipitation of only 129 6 mm and an annual potential et of 1400 mm chen et al 2018 and the drought situation will be more severe under future climate change leng et al 2015 the tremendous agricultural irrigation water demand creates a strong contradiction with local water resources deficiency the groundwater level has declined 1 86 m because of irrigation water requirement over the past three decades niu et al 2019 on one hand irrigation water scarcity affects the development of agricultural production on other hand excessive exploitation of water resources can also lead to serious environmental issues tweed et al 2018 therefore the et reduction caused by elevated c o 2 is beneficial to alleviate water shortage to some extent the vegetation in the middle reaches of the heihe river is composed of various crops e g maize wheat accompanied by a small number of evergreen needleleaf forests deciduous broadleaf forests and grasslands fig 3 maize and wheat are the two most important grain crops zou et al 2017 with a total planting area exceeding 60 of the planting area in the middle reaches maize is cultivated in late april and harvested in late september wheat is cultivated in early april and harvested in late july niu et al 2018 zhao et al 2005 the spatial distribution of maize and wheat planting area shows a different pattern in which maize is concentrated in the central and northern part and wheat in the southeast part fig 2 the crop water consumption for maize and wheat makes up the biggest proportion of agricultural water use in the agricultural land so we focus on the et responses of maize and wheat 2 2 model description and irrigation scheme the variable infiltration capacity model is a physical mechanism based semi distributed large scale hydrological model developed by liang et al 1994 the main characteristics of this model are as follows the infiltration capacity curve of the xin anjiang model is employed to indicate the change of soil water storage capacity zhao 1992 the nonlinear arno model is used to describe the base flow release the calculation of water and energy balance can be carried out simultaneously franchini and pacciani 1991 the vic is a grid based hydrological model the land cover of each grid is composed of bare soil and n vegetation types the vertical direction of the grid is divided into a canopy layer and three layer soil columns the surface runoff base flow and evapotranspiration for different land cover types are calculated separately evapotranspiration the focus of this article is calculated using the penman monteith formulation shuttleworth 1993 the bare soil evaporation e 1 the vegetation transpiration e t and the canopy evaporation e c for each vegetation in the grid are calculated finally the total evapotranspiration of the grid is obtained by weighting the ratio of vegetation fraction c v in the grid eq 1 1 et n 1 n c v n e c n e t n c v n 1 e 1 the original vic model by liang et al 1994 has been successfully applied to hydrological simulations for large river basins lakshmi et al 2004 nijssen et al 1997 niu et al 2015 without considering the effects of irrigation an irrigation scheme has been developed in the vic model by haddeland et al 2006 based on the simulated soil moisture deficit irrigation starts when soil moisture drops below the wilting point the level when transpiration becomes limited and continues until soil moisture reaches field capacity irrigation water can be obtained from different water sources such as the river channel and reservoirs in the basin the water availability will restrict irrigation water therefore the model provides an additional mode free irrigation in which case it is assumed that water is freely available chen et al 2018 the crop water requirement is fully satisfied by precipitation and irrigation in this mode then irrigation water requirement can be calculated the vic model coupled with the irrigation scheme has been widely used for studying the effects of irrigation on the water and energy balances haddeland et al 2006 tatsumi and yamashiki 2015 and it has also been proved to be effective in the heihe river basin chen et al 2018 niu et al 2019 thus the vic model was selected to represent a more realistic et response over the agricultural land in this study the water balance terms were computed for the agricultural land at 0 125 spatial resolution at free irrigation mode the simulation period is 1980 2010 for historical and 2020 2100 for future scenarios at a daily time step the driving forcing were daily precipitation daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature and c o 2 concentration 2 3 model input and evaluation data the data used in this study include the elevation data meteorological forcing data land use and validation data as listed in table 1 the digital elevation model is obtained from the data management center of the heihe research program http heihe westgis ac cn zh hans to delineate the boundaries of the middle reaches of the heihe river the meteorological forcing in this study are daily precipitation daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature and c o 2 concentration the historical forcing 1980 2010 are also obtained from the data management center of the heihe research program the 3 km spatial resolution of 6 hour precipitation daily maximum temperature and minimum temperature are aggregated into grid cells with 0 125 0 125 spatial resolution the 6 hour precipitation data are also upscaled to daily

is the simulated value q is the average of the observed value and p is the average of the simulated value 2 4 gcms downscaling the monthly data of eight gcms table 2 are downscaled to daily data by applying the delta method described in jin and sridhar 2012 for each month of one grid cell in the future a historical year 1980 2010 was randomly selected and the corresponding month data was used to calculate the changes for precipitation and temperature between them the ratio r between the future daily mean precipitation and the historical daily mean precipitation of the month was calculated the difference δ t between the future daily mean temperature and the historical daily mean temperature of the month was also computed then the ratio r and difference δ t were multiplied and added to the historical daily data to obtain future daily precipitation and temperature for that month respectively the above procedure is repeated for other months of the year for future year and finally we perform the procedures for the remaining grid cells in the study area jin and sridhar 2012 the downscaled future daily data were further evaluated with historical daily data for the year 2006 2010 the overall result is satisfactory as shown in table 2 the historical climate trends are generally explained by the gcms especially for temperature to reduce the climate uncertainty between different gcms all the gcm models are utilized in computing future et response with an ensemble analysis 2 5 modifications and scenario settings the et responses to elevated c o 2 concentration is mainly regulated by g s and l a i based on previous research niu et al 2013 and wu et al 2012 adopted the linear relationship between g s and l a i to c o 2 to study the hydrological processes such as runoff and evapotranspiration nevertheless the c o 2 concentration was limited to 660 ppm in the linear relationship which hindered the research on higher c o 2 concentration a nonlinear g s c o 2 relationship which means that g s decreased and the reduction rate gradually lessened as c o 2 increased was proposed based on 50 representative journal articles and the experimental data li et al 2019 the nonlinear relationship had better et estimates at all c o 2 concentration levels compared with experimental results this nonlinear relationship makes up for the deficiency of the linear model to improve the representation of et in the vic model under both historical period and future scenarios the linear l a i c o 2 the linear and nonlinear g s c o 2 relationships are all considered in this study for the g s c o 2 response relationship both the linear response and the nonlinear response are applied to the vic model for validating a more appropriate response relationship in this study eqs 6 and 7 linear 6 g s c o 2 g s 1 p p c o 2 c o 2 r e f nonlinear 7 g s c o 2 g s 1 1 b c o 2 c o 2 r e f 1 for the l a i c o 2 response relationship we use the linear relationship eq 8 8 l a i c o 2 l a i 1 q q c o 2 c o 2 r e f among them l a i and g s are leaf area index and stomatal conductance without considering the influence of c o 2 l a i c o 2 and g s c o 2 are l a i and g s affected by elevated c o 2 q and p are the increase rate of l a i and the decrease rate of g s under the elevated c o 2 concentration respectively c o 2 is the concentration of c o 2 ppm and c o 2 r e f is the baseline c o 2 concentration 330 ppm and b is the empirical parameter acquired by the least square method which is 0 663 li et al 2019 in describing the linear relationship of l a i c o 2 and g s c o 2 the selection of q and p refers to the research results of many predecessors medlyn et al 2001 morison 1987 pritchard et al 1999 wand et al 1999 wu et al 2012 according to the above three functions the source code of the vic model has been modified based on the previous vic model modification by niu et al 2013 we further incorporate the new nonlinear g s c o 2 relationship into the vic model to evaluate the different impacts of these relationships on et five scenarios were set for the vic model simulations vic means the model that does not consider the influence of c o 2 vic linear means the modified vic model that considers the linear g s c o 2 and l a i c o 2 vic nonlinear means the modified vic model that considers the nonlinear g s c o 2 and l a i c o 2 vic gs means the modified vic model that only considers the nonlinear g s c o 2 vic lai means the modified vic model that only considers the l a i c o 2 in addition the periods in the future scenarios are split into 2020 2060 2040s and 2061 2100 2080s in this study 3 results 3 1 model evaluation 3 1 1 et spatiotemporal pattern comparison three sets of et products over the agricultural land were compared with vic results as shown in fig 4 the annual average 1985 2010 et results by vic are basically agree with the crop distribution pattern in this region fig 2 higher et values are mainly concentrated in the densely planted area the central and southeast part of the region while lower et values are scattered in the sparsely vegetated area the north part of the region as for the spatial pattern the three products share the same pattern that the et values are higher in the southeast than those in the northwest the spatial pattern of vic is more consistent with ntsg while the magnitude is closer to clm regarding to the temporal variation of et along the time the precipitation and et watch only for the period of 2000 2010 due to data availability are supplemented in the last subfigure for comparison with other data products the et of vic keeps a high correlation with precipitation the highly synchronous interannual change with clm is also noticed except for several points more regulated by precipitation the annual et variation for three products clm ntsg et watch generally share the same trend but et values for ntsg are lower than others overall the results of vic are comparable with other data products regarding annual et clm is more appropriate not only in the spatiotemporal pattern but also in et magnitude so we select clm as the benchmark data based on the comparisons further nine typical grids are selected to compare the monthly results with the clm benchmark data the geographical locations of the nine grids are illustrated in fig 2 covering different locations in the northwest part central part and southeast part in the agricultural land the validation results and corresponding crop fraction for each grid are shown in fig 5 and table 3 for the grids with different spatial positions and different crop fractions the vic model simulated monthly et reasonably the overall simulations are satisfactory with an nse range 0 75 0 93 and an r2 range 0 78 0 95 p 0 001 which can be interpreted as very good simulations moriasi et al 2007 for these grids although the overall satisfied performance et for several grids is still overestimated especially during the crop growth stage which implies the vic model application can be improved 3 1 2 improvement of the modified model two modified models vic linear and vic nonlinear are applied to simulate et for demonstrating the improvement of the model modification to the elevated c o 2 concentration the annual et 2000 2010 over the agricultural land of different models and data products are shown in fig 6 the annual et for this region is approximately 250 mm according to the results of et watch and clm fig 6a the approaching trend from the modified models to the benchmark data clm and et watch data can be observed by the absolute values of the annual et and more obvious by the standardized annual et fig 6b the et by vic nonlinear model is closer to the benchmark data this is in accordance with li et al 2019 that the modified hyperbolic g s c o 2 model i e the nonlinear model here is superior to the linear model besides the small difference between vic nonlinear and vic linear indicates the nonlinear actually acts approximately as a linear approach for a low c o 2 concentration hence the nonlinear is a more comprehensive model which is applicable for both low and high c o 2 concentration consequently we adopted the vic nonlinear model to study the effects of elevated c o 2 in the following context 3 2 31 year retrospective simulation 1980 2010 3 2 1 estimation under historical c o 2 concentration the effects of different factors g s l a i on annual et change of maize and wheat are estimated by four models vic vic gs vic lai vic nonlinear under historical c o 2 concentration from 337 9 ppm in 1980 to 389 79 ppm in 2010 noaa esrl fig 7 displays the annual et change of maize and wheat under vic gs and vic nonlinear models under the vic gs model the annual et reduction of maize increased gradually from 1 1 mm to 9 3 mm with the elevated c o 2 concentration when considering the effects of g s c o 2 and l a i c o 2 i e vic nonlinear the annual et reduction decreased to some extent the reason is that the decrease in g s reduced water loss but the increase of l a i caused by enhanced photosynthesis offset part of the stomatal effect kergoat et al 2002 for wheat a smaller annual et reduction can be found under the vic nonlinear model the maximum annual et of maize decreased by more than 1 0 while that of wheat decreased by about 0 5 the et response of maize was heavier than that of wheat but what maize and wheat have in common is the et reduction trend the annual et under vic gs and vic nonlinear both showed a decreasing trend in general and the et reduction magnitude increased year by year impacted by g s only the annual average et change was the greatest which was reduced by 0 91 and 0 29 for maize and wheat respectively fig 8 instead l a i exerted an increasing effect on et the annual et of maize and wheat increased by 0 36 and 0 07 respectively when only l a i is considered vic lai for maize the et change by vic gs 0 91 was higher than that by vic lai 0 36 resulting in an et reduction under vic nonlinear 0 54 the impact of l a i c o 2 on the hydrological process is weaker than that of g s c o 2 generally speaking the compensatory effect of g s and l a i ultimately reduced the annual et of maize and wheat by 0 54 and 0 21 respectively 3 2 2 estimation under doubled c o 2 concentration the et reduction under the historical period is relatively small due to low c o 2 concentration however the c o 2 concentration will probably reach 538 ppm and 936 ppm under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 by the year 2100 ipcc 2013 respectively hence a doubled c o 2 concentration was set up to investigate the corresponding et response of maize and wheat the et difference between the doubled 660 ppm c o 2 and baseline 330 ppm c o 2 concentration was calculated fig 9 the annual average et of maize and wheat were 546 mm and 496 mm respectively which were comparable with the other studies over the agricultural land guo et al 2020 ma et al 2020 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 zhao and zhao 2014 the et reduction of maize and wheat was 23 3 mm and 8 9 mm which accounted for 4 3 and 1 8 of the corresponding annual et besides compared with the response under historical c o 2 concentration the annual et reduction of maize and wheat increased from 0 54 to 4 3 and 0 21 to 1 8 respectively nearly ten times the increase the significant et reduction under doubled c o 2 concentration shall not be neglected any more due to its role in reducing crop water requirements 3 3 et response to future scenarios 2020 2100 3 3 1 annual et change under future scenarios the future period 2020 2100 was split into the 2040 s 2020 2060 and the 2080 s 2061 2100 in this study two rcps rcp4 5 rcp8 5 are selected to represent future climate change projected by eight gcms by applying the vic nonlinear model the range of the et reduction under different gcms and rcps are shown in fig 10 the annual et for maize decreased from 10 mm to 40 mm with the elevated c o 2 under rcp8 5 the annual et response under rcp4 5 was about half of that under rcp8 5 the linear trends of et reduction were also found both under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 with the increasing rates of 0 12 mm and 0 35 mm for annual et reduction respectively the et reduction of wheat shared the same trend with maize despite a smaller magnitude fig 11 shows diverse et responses under four combinations of rcps the annual et reduction for maize was much smaller under rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s with a range from 2 to 3 while the et reduction under rcp8 5 2080s reached 5 for some gcms the corresponding annual et reduction was 7 6 mm 10 9 mm 9 6 mm 19 5 mm respectively which is in the range of about 1 1 6 4 the similarity in et reduction between the four scenarios was also found for wheat observations of crops grown under elevated c o 2 face show that an average 5 reduction in et can be expected leakey et al 2009 the larger et reduction for maize was also reported by deryng et al 2016 that c o 2 simulations for 2080 rcp8 5 relative to 2000 decreased et of maize and wheat by 9 2 and 4 4 respectively 3 3 2 comparisons with the baseline condition the comparisons for three climatic forcing precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature over the agricultural land between future scenarios and baseline conditions 1980 2010 were conducted to have an overview of their influence on future et fig 12 as indicated in fig 12 the precipitation shows a decreasing trend except for rcp8 5 2080s with an overall range of 40 20 mm the temperature tends to increase in all cases the most dramatic scenario is rcp8 5 2080s with the largest variation for all forcing on account of the driving forcing for the vic model in this study the et response resulted from climatic forcing only without c o 2 and all four forcing with c o 2 were analyzed separately fig 13 a range from 20 mm to 100 mm et change of maize was detected to decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature though the increasing pattern of et was opposite with decreasing precipitation it was reasonable for the free irrigation scheme applied in the vic model which meant the crop water requirement was fully satisfied with freely available water haddeland et al 2006 chen et al 2018 besides the increasing temperature also promoted the increment of et the comparison between without c o 2 and with c o 2 contributes to evaluate the impact of the different forcing when the c o 2 concentration was complemented as another forcing the increase in et has decreased the et reduction by elevated c o 2 concentration offset some et increase caused by precipitation and temperature changes in summary the effects of elevated c o 2 offset 69 28 et increase caused by the climatic forcing for maize and wheat respectively 4 discussion 4 1 et reduction between history and future the et reduction during the historical period was inconspicuous with 0 54 0 21 for maize for wheat in the studied region fig 8 the small change can be attributed to the lower c o 2 concentration level from 337 9 ppm in 1980 to 389 79 ppm in 2010 and the opposite effect of g s and l a i on et kergoat et al 2002 kimball et al 2002 burkart et al 2011 nevertheless compared with the response under doubled c o 2 concentration 660 ppm the annual et reduction of maize and wheat increased from 0 54 to 4 3 and 0 21 to 1 8 respectively nearly ten times the increase during historical period fig 9 besides the c o 2 concentration under future scenarios will continue to rise 538 ppm 936 ppm under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 by the year 2100 the annual et reduction of maize and wheat was further increased to approximately 5 and 2 respectively under rcp 2080s fig 11 which occupies a considerable proportion of crop water requirements though smaller changes of et were found during the historical period a much more significant et reduction under elevated c o 2 shall not be neglected any more due to its important role in reducing crop water requirements which will be instructive for agriculture irrigation kang et al 2017 4 2 different responses characteristics of maize and wheat the et reduction of wheat under the elevated c o 2 is generally weaker than that of maize under both historical and future periods such a difference for et response between maize and wheat is consistent with other works deryng et al 2016 kang et al 1999 reddy et al 2010 about it different photosynthetic mechanisms are maintained by c 3 and c 4 plants photosynthesis rate for c 4 plants are almost saturated under normal atmospheric c o 2 concentration while that of c 3 plants are not reddy et al 2010 mauney et al 1994 therefore the elevated c o 2 concentration has a larger effect on c 3 plants than on c 4 plants regarding photosynthetic rate triggs et al 2004 ziska et al 1990 and the corresponding growth promotion of c 3 plants are more intense resulting in greater water consumption of c 3 plants while the stomatal conductance is reduced for both c 3 and c 4 plants due to the elevated c o 2 concentration in the atmosphere burkart et al 2011 kimball et al 2002 besides the different crop growth durations for maize and wheat can also contribute to the different et responses the growth duration for wheat from early april to late july is usually shorter than that for maize from late april to late september leading to less et accumulation and the growth duration for maize has experienced the hottest month of the year which enhances the et accordingly ma et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 consequently a smaller et reduction was confirmed for wheat c 3 plants kang et al 1999 reddy et al 2010 the larger et response of maize to elevated c o 2 concentration should be paid more attention in view of the most planting area and large crop water requirement in the agricultural land 4 3 implications for agriculture irrigation the relationship between the variation of c o 2 concentration and the cumulative annual et per 100 mm of irrigation water requirement the irrigation water using coefficient for 1980 2010 was 0 527 chen et al 2018 was shown in fig 14 both maize and wheat showed a significant nonlinear relationship between c o 2 concentration and cumulative annual et per 100 mm irrigation water this relationship was fitted by a quadratic polynomial with high accuracy maize and wheat hold a certain water saving capacity with the elevated c o 2 concentration when the c o 2 concentration was at a low range of 340 350 ppm the et showed little response to c o 2 however the et reduction per 10 ppm increase of c o 2 tends to increase gradually as the c o 2 increased from 2 mm reduction to 4 mm reduction with the c o 2 concentration varying from 360 370 ppm to 370 380 ppm which indicated that the water saving capacity was enhanced by the higher c o 2 for every 100 mm irrigation water the higher the c o 2 concentration the more the et reduction will be the elevated c o 2 concentration will be beneficial for saving irrigation water to a certain degree 4 4 uncertainties and limitations some uncertainties in this study include future scenarios projected by the eight gcms the downscaling method the parameters of the model the future scenarios by ipcc can be improved due to the imperfection of climate models fu et al 2013 the downscaling method applied in this study also needs some improvement jin and sridhar 2012 although these uncertainties are difficult to eliminate we have tried to minimize the uncertainties by using ensemble gcms and evaluating the model performance comprehensively the general conclusions of this study are draw based on these certainly there are several limitations to this research the mitigation and adaptation of the crops under future scenarios were not considered for instance crop phenology may be impacted by future climate change elevated temperature tends to accelerate crop growth and shorten crop growth durations asseng et al 2015 xiao et al 2020 which may change the et response the possible change in spatial distribution for crops under future scenarios is also a limitation here the suitable areas for planting are likely to move northwards due to elevated temperature liu et al 2015 besides the physiological effects of c o 2 on plants are multifaceted li et al 2019 here we only considered the major factors g s and l a i other factors such as crop height were not taken into account a more comprehensive analysis and research will be conducted in future work 5 conclusions the et responses of maize and wheat to elevated c o 2 concentration were studied by improving the representation of g s c o 2 relationship in the vic model the modified nonlinear model had better estimations of et over the agricultural land in the heihe river basin northwest china the et responses to elevated c o 2 under the historical period were relatively small with an annual et reduction of 0 54 and 0 21 for maize and wheat respectively the et reduction due to g s c o 2 was offset by 0 36 and 0 07 by l a i c o 2 under doubled c o 2 concentration the et reduction of maize and wheat were 23 3 mm and 8 9 mm which accounted for 4 3 and 1 8 of the corresponding annual et respectively two rcps and eight gcms were selected to evaluate the et response under future scenarios the annual et response under rcp4 5 was about half of that under rcp8 5 the annual et reductions under four scenarios rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s rcp8 5 2080s were 7 6 mm 10 9 mm 9 6 mm 19 5 mm respectively the effects of elevated c o 2 offset 69 28 et increase caused by climatic forcing for maize and wheat in the studied region the discrepancies between maize and wheat are possibly due to the special photosynthesis mechanism and crop growth durations overall the effects of elevated c o 2 on et have been well demonstrated in this paper this study holds some implications for agriculture irrigation though lower changes of et was found during the historical period the higher et reduction under elevated c o 2 shall not be neglected any more the larger et response of maize should be paid more attention the higher c o 2 concentration the more et reduction will be the elevated c o 2 concentration will be beneficial for saving irrigation water to a certain degree credit authorship contribution statement dehai liao data curation visualization

4928,the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide c o 2 concentration is changing plant physiology thus affecting terrestrial hydrological response a nonlinear stomatal conductance response to carbon dioxide concentration g s c o 2 was incorporated in the vic model for better representation of the evapotranspiration et response to the elevated c o 2 the annual et of maize and wheat over the agricultural land in northwest china was found to decrease by 0 54 and 0 21 during 1980 2010 respectively under doubled c o 2 concentration 660 ppm the et reduction of maize and wheat was 23 3 mm and 8 9 mm which accounted for 4 3 and 1 8 of the corresponding annual et the annual et reduction of maize under the four future scenarios rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s and rcp8 5 2080s was about 1 1 6 4 resulted from an ensemble mean of eight general circulation models the effects of elevated c o 2 offset part of et increase caused by the precipitation and temperature changes this study has practical implications for precise irrigation the et response of maize should be paid more attention for its larger potential in saving irrigation water for the studied region the elevated c o 2 concentration will be beneficial for saving irrigation water to a certain degree keywords carbon dioxide maize modified vic model evapotranspiration agricultural land 1 introduction the atmospheric carbon dioxide c o 2 concentration is rising rapidly due to the burning of fossil fuels the development of industry intensifying agriculture and the increasing population ipcc 2013 current c o 2 concentration is higher by almost 40 compared to the period of pre industrialization and will continue to rise in the future four representative concentration pathways for greenhouse gas emissions in future climates were proposed in the fifth assessment report ar5 namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 rcp8 5 and the prescribed c o 2 concentrations will reach 421 ppm parts per million 538 ppm 670 ppm and 936 ppm by the year 2100 respectively ipcc 2013 the elevated c o 2 concentration is accompanied by not only the greenhouse effect but also its direct and indirect impacts on agriculture and hydrology cheng et al 2014 mooney and koch 1994 morison 1987 the elevated c o 2 concentration exerts great impacts on the characteristics of the underlying surface by altering the plant growth which is inherently tied to the hydrological cycle ficklin et al 2009 plant physiology such as photosynthesis and transpiration has been altered due to c o 2 enrichment some related plant physiological structures are then changed accordingly to accommodate the natural environment for instance reflected by leaf area index l a i and stomatal conductance g s the changes in l a i and g s consequently affect the hydrological elements evapotranspiration runoff soil moisture etc in the process of the water cycle reddy et al 2010 evapotranspiration et is particularly subjected to the change in l a i and g s the stoma is the main channel for plants to dissipate water and exchange gas with the atmosphere the g s is reduced and relational transpiration are weakened under elevated c o 2 thereby plant et declines field et al 1995 hungate et al 2002 kang et al 1997 pan et al 2015 meanwhile photosynthetic rate and water use efficiency is improved due to elevated c o 2 lenka et al 2020 qi et al 2015 ziska et al 1990 making a larger leaf area which enhances et the elevated c o 2 concentration has both promoting and inhibiting effects on et in the past many experiments have been conducted such as either in a growth chamber li et al 2019 qiao et al 2010 or in free air c o 2 enrichment face kimball et al 1999 2002 triggs et al 2004 to assess the effects of elevated c o 2 concentration on et these experiments concluded that et will decrease to some extent with the combination of two factors g s l a i based on the experimental results many scholars further quantified the response of g s to c o 2 g s c o 2 l a i to c o 2 l a i c o 2 easterling et al 1992 medlyn et al 2001 morison 1987 pritchard et al 1999 wand et al 1999 li et al 2019 which enabled relevant studies on hydrological response to elevated c o 2 to be carried out extensively morison 1987 introduced a linear g s c o 2 relationship in the erosion productivity impact calculator model epic easterling et al 1992 to account for c o 2 enrichment by compiling plant physiological data from the literature on the plant response to elevated c o 2 eckhaedt and ulbrich 2003 incorporated the linear g s c o 2 and l a i c o 2 functions into the soil and water assessment tool swat model many studies have been conducted to investigate et runoff and crop growth under historical and future climate change by applying the linear relationship niu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2012 under doubled c o 2 concentration 660 ppm the et in the upper mississippi river basin was reduced by 11 wu et al 2012 a 3 16 et reduction due to doubled c o 2 was also found in the xijiang river basin niu et al 2013 in their studies linear responses of both g s and l a i to c o 2 are structured and incorporated into hydrological models to analyze the regional hydrological response however the linear g s c o 2 relationship is limited to the case where the c o 2 concentration is less than 660 ppm morison 1987 pritchard et al 1999 yet the c o 2 concentration will possibly exceed 660 ppm under the projected future scenarios as reported by ar5 which means the applicability of the linear model for the future can t be guaranteed a nonlinear g s c o 2 relationship was opportunely proposed by li et al 2019 to expand the applicability when c o 2 concentration is high li et al 2019 summarized the data in 50 representative journal articles and obtained the nonlinear response relationship of g s c o 2 by the least square method the nonlinear g s c o 2 relationship was further validated by experimental data and the results proved that the nonlinear model was superior to other models regarding et simulation the rapid increase in c o 2 concentration will inevitably lead to changes in et as a key process in the hydrological cycle et plays a vital role in plant water consumption accurate et estimations are essential to both the hydrological cycle and agricultural irrigation activities liu et al 2020 the et reduction caused by elevated c o 2 has been reported by both experimental results and numerical modeling burkart et al 2011 wu et al 2012 niu et al 2013 however most of them focused on the natural hydrological response the research scope can be extended to the response of crop et in agricultural land due to the frequent human activities such as farming and irrigation the response of crop et under elevated c o 2 and the associated changes in irrigation water requirement will impose more impact on the regional hydrological cycle zou et al 2020 so the et response over agricultural land has more important implications for regional water resources management xiao et al 2020 the agricultural land in northwest china which is one of the ten largest commodity grain bases nationally is confronted with deficient water resources it is located in an arid region where rainfall is extremely limited while the sufficient sunlight and suitable temperature make it possible to plant various crops the contradiction between huge irrigation demands and scarce water resources has become a factor restricting regional development liu et al 2017b studying the crop et response under the elevated c o 2 concentration namely the change of crop water consumption can provide reference and basis for agricultural production and regional water management which is of great significance for the sustainable development of regional society and economy especially under the changing climate chen et al 2019 kang et al 2017 to explore the effects of elevated c o 2 on et over agricultural land one of the large scale hydrological models the variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 model was modified to better represent et response under the influence of g s c o 2 and l a i c o 2 the l a i c o 2 and g s c o 2 relationships were embedded in the vic model to study the et response over agricultural land more comprehensively both the nonlinear g s c o 2 and the linear g s c o 2 relationship were incorporated into the vic model respectively for validating the better g s c o 2 model in this study fig 1 the et response of two dominant crops in the agricultural land maize and wheat were investigated for quantifying the effects of elevated c o 2 under the historical period 1980 2010 and future scenarios 2020 2100 eight general circulation models gcms were adopted for a more comprehensive analysis two rcps rcp4 5 rcp8 5 were considered to account for c o 2 concentration change under projected future scenarios the objectives of this study are 1 to improve the capability of the vic model to simulate et 2 to calculate and analyze the et response of two crops in the agricultural land under the historical period and future scenarios 3 to provide support for agricultural irrigation under elevated c o 2 concentration 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the agricultural land is located in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin as shown by the red frame in fig 2 the heihe river basin lies in the middle part of the hexi corridor in northwest china it is the second largest inland river basin in china with a total area of 11 6 104 square kilometers niu et al 2018 the middle reaches of the heihe river basin with an elevation range of 1300 1700 m zhu et al 2008 are a vast plain area about 2 56 104 square kilometers with abundant light and heat resources the soil types mainly include silt loam sandy loam loam and loam sandy soil zhao et al 2010 the annual sunshine time ranges from 3000 to 4000 h and the annual average temperature ranges from 6 to 8 c making an ideal area for agricultural production nearly 98 of the farmland in the basin is concentrated in the middle reaches chen et al 2018 however the heihe river basin is also a typical arid and semi arid climate zone with annual precipitation of only 129 6 mm and an annual potential et of 1400 mm chen et al 2018 and the drought situation will be more severe under future climate change leng et al 2015 the tremendous agricultural irrigation water demand creates a strong contradiction with local water resources deficiency the groundwater level has declined 1 86 m because of irrigation water requirement over the past three decades niu et al 2019 on one hand irrigation water scarcity affects the development of agricultural production on other hand excessive exploitation of water resources can also lead to serious environmental issues tweed et al 2018 therefore the et reduction caused by elevated c o 2 is beneficial to alleviate water shortage to some extent the vegetation in the middle reaches of the heihe river is composed of various crops e g maize wheat accompanied by a small number of evergreen needleleaf forests deciduous broadleaf forests and grasslands fig 3 maize and wheat are the two most important grain crops zou et al 2017 with a total planting area exceeding 60 of the planting area in the middle reaches maize is cultivated in late april and harvested in late september wheat is cultivated in early april and harvested in late july niu et al 2018 zhao et al 2005 the spatial distribution of maize and wheat planting area shows a different pattern in which maize is concentrated in the central and northern part and wheat in the southeast part fig 2 the crop water consumption for maize and wheat makes up the biggest proportion of agricultural water use in the agricultural land so we focus on the et responses of maize and wheat 2 2 model description and irrigation scheme the variable infiltration capacity model is a physical mechanism based semi distributed large scale hydrological model developed by liang et al 1994 the main characteristics of this model are as follows the infiltration capacity curve of the xin anjiang model is employed to indicate the change of soil water storage capacity zhao 1992 the nonlinear arno model is used to describe the base flow release the calculation of water and energy balance can be carried out simultaneously franchini and pacciani 1991 the vic is a grid based hydrological model the land cover of each grid is composed of bare soil and n vegetation types the vertical direction of the grid is divided into a canopy layer and three layer soil columns the surface runoff base flow and evapotranspiration for different land cover types are calculated separately evapotranspiration the focus of this article is calculated using the penman monteith formulation shuttleworth 1993 the bare soil evaporation e 1 the vegetation transpiration e t and the canopy evaporation e c for each vegetation in the grid are calculated finally the total evapotranspiration of the grid is obtained by weighting the ratio of vegetation fraction c v in the grid eq 1 1 et n 1 n c v n e c n e t n c v n 1 e 1 the original vic model by liang et al 1994 has been successfully applied to hydrological simulations for large river basins lakshmi et al 2004 nijssen et al 1997 niu et al 2015 without considering the effects of irrigation an irrigation scheme has been developed in the vic model by haddeland et al 2006 based on the simulated soil moisture deficit irrigation starts when soil moisture drops below the wilting point the level when transpiration becomes limited and continues until soil moisture reaches field capacity irrigation water can be obtained from different water sources such as the river channel and reservoirs in the basin the water availability will restrict irrigation water therefore the model provides an additional mode free irrigation in which case it is assumed that water is freely available chen et al 2018 the crop water requirement is fully satisfied by precipitation and irrigation in this mode then irrigation water requirement can be calculated the vic model coupled with the irrigation scheme has been widely used for studying the effects of irrigation on the water and energy balances haddeland et al 2006 tatsumi and yamashiki 2015 and it has also been proved to be effective in the heihe river basin chen et al 2018 niu et al 2019 thus the vic model was selected to represent a more realistic et response over the agricultural land in this study the water balance terms were computed for the agricultural land at 0 125 spatial resolution at free irrigation mode the simulation period is 1980 2010 for historical and 2020 2100 for future scenarios at a daily time step the driving forcing were daily precipitation daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature and c o 2 concentration 2 3 model input and evaluation data the data used in this study

is the simulated value q is the average of the observed value and p is the average of the simulated value 2 4 gcms downscaling the monthly data of eight gcms table 2 are downscaled to daily data by applying the delta method described in jin and sridhar 2012 for each month of one grid cell in the future a historical year 1980 2010 was randomly selected and the corresponding month data was used to calculate the changes for precipitation and temperature between them the ratio r between the future daily mean precipitation and the historical daily mean precipitation of the month was calculated the difference δ t between the future daily mean temperature and the historical daily mean temperature of the month was also computed then the ratio r and difference δ t were multiplied and added to the historical daily data to obtain future daily precipitation and temperature for that month respectively the above procedure is repeated for other months of the year for future year and finally we perform the procedures for the remaining grid cells in the study area jin and sridhar 2012 the downscaled future daily data were further evaluated with historical daily data for the year 2006 2010 the overall result is satisfactory as shown in table 2 the historical climate trends are generally explained by the gcms especially for temperature to reduce the climate uncertainty between different gcms all the gcm models are utilized in computing future et response with an ensemble analysis 2 5 modifications and scenario settings the et responses to elevated c o 2 concentration is mainly regulated by g s and l a i based on previous research niu et al 2013 and wu et al 2012 adopted the linear relationship between g s and l a i to c o 2 to study the hydrological processes such as runoff and evapotranspiration nevertheless the c o 2 concentration was limited to 660 ppm in the linear relationship which hindered the research on higher c o 2 concentration a nonlinear g s c o 2 relationship which means that g s decreased and the reduction rate gradually lessened as c o 2 increased was proposed based on 50 representative journal articles and the experimental data li et al 2019 the nonlinear relationship had better et estimates at all c o 2 concentration levels compared with experimental results this nonlinear relationship makes up for the deficiency of the linear model to improve the representation of et in the vic model under both historical period and future scenarios the linear l a i c o 2 the linear and nonlinear g s c o 2 relationships are all considered in this study for the g s c o 2 response relationship both the linear response and the nonlinear response are applied to the vic model for validating a more appropriate response relationship in this study eqs 6 and 7 linear 6 g s c o 2 g s 1 p p c o 2 c o 2 r e f nonlinear 7 g s c o 2 g s 1 1 b c o 2 c o 2 r e f 1 for the l a i c o 2 response relationship we use the linear relationship eq 8 8 l a i c o 2 l a i 1 q q c o 2 c o 2 r e f among them l a i and g s are leaf area index and stomatal conductance without considering the influence of c o 2 l a i c o 2 and g s c o 2 are l a i and g s affected by elevated c o 2 q and p are the increase rate of l a i and the decrease rate of g s under the elevated c o 2 concentration respectively c o 2 is the concentration of c o 2 ppm and c o 2 r e f is the baseline c o 2 concentration 330 ppm and b is the empirical parameter acquired by the least square method which is 0 663 li et al 2019 in describing the linear relationship of l a i c o 2 and g s c o 2 the selection of q and p refers to the research results of many predecessors medlyn et al 2001 morison 1987 pritchard et al 1999 wand et al 1999 wu et al 2012 according to the above three functions the source code of the vic model has been modified based on the previous vic model modification by niu et al 2013 we further incorporate the new nonlinear g s c o 2 relationship into the vic model to evaluate the different impacts of these relationships on et five scenarios were set for the vic model simulations vic means the model that does not consider the influence of c o 2 vic linear means the modified vic model that considers the linear g s c o 2 and l a i c o 2 vic nonlinear means the modified vic model that considers the nonlinear g s c o 2 and l a i c o 2 vic gs means the modified vic model that only considers the nonlinear g s c o 2 vic lai means the modified vic model that only considers the l a i c o 2 in addition the periods in the future scenarios are split into 2020 2060 2040s and 2061 2100 2080s in this study 3 results 3 1 model evaluation 3 1 1 et spatiotemporal pattern comparison three sets of et products over the agricultural land were compared with vic results as shown in fig 4 the annual average 1985 2010 et results by vic are basically agree with the crop distribution pattern in this region fig 2 higher et values are mainly concentrated in the densely planted area the central and southeast part of the region while lower et values are scattered in the sparsely vegetated area the north part of the region as for the spatial pattern the three products share the same pattern that the et values are higher in the southeast than those in the northwest the spatial pattern of vic is more consistent with ntsg while the magnitude is closer to clm regarding to the temporal variation of et along the time the precipitation and et watch only for the period of 2000 2010 due to data availability are supplemented in the last subfigure for comparison with other data products the et of vic keeps a high correlation with precipitation the highly synchronous interannual change with clm is also noticed except for several points more regulated by precipitation the annual et variation for three products clm ntsg et watch generally share the same trend but et values for ntsg are lower than others overall the results of vic are comparable with other data products regarding annual et clm is more appropriate not only in the spatiotemporal pattern but also in et magnitude so we select clm as the benchmark data based on the comparisons further nine typical grids are selected to compare the monthly results with the clm benchmark data the geographical locations of the nine grids are illustrated in fig 2 covering different locations in the northwest part central part and southeast part in the agricultural land the validation results and corresponding crop fraction for each grid are shown in fig 5 and table 3 for the grids with different spatial positions and different crop fractions the vic model simulated monthly et reasonably the overall simulations are satisfactory with an nse range 0 75 0 93 and an r2 range 0 78 0 95 p 0 001 which can be interpreted as very good simulations moriasi et al 2007 for these grids although the overall satisfied performance et for several grids is still overestimated especially during the crop growth stage which implies the vic model application can be improved 3 1 2 improvement of the modified model two modified models vic linear and vic nonlinear are applied to simulate et for demonstrating the improvement of the model modification to the elevated c o 2 concentration the annual et 2000 2010 over the agricultural land of different models and data products are shown in fig 6 the annual et for this region is approximately 250 mm according to the results of et watch and clm fig 6a the approaching trend from the modified models to the benchmark data clm and et watch data can be observed by the absolute values of the annual et and more obvious by the standardized annual et fig 6b the et by vic nonlinear model is closer to the benchmark data this is in accordance with li et al 2019 that the modified hyperbolic g s c o 2 model i e the nonlinear model here is superior to the linear model besides the small difference between vic nonlinear and vic linear indicates the nonlinear actually acts approximately as a linear approach for a low c o 2 concentration hence the nonlinear is a more comprehensive model which is applicable for both low and high c o 2 concentration consequently we adopted the vic nonlinear model to study the effects of elevated c o 2 in the following context 3 2 31 year retrospective simulation 1980 2010 3 2 1 estimation under historical c o 2 concentration the effects of different factors g s l a i on annual et change of maize and wheat are estimated by four models vic vic gs vic lai vic nonlinear under historical c o 2 concentration from 337 9 ppm in 1980 to 389 79 ppm in 2010 noaa esrl fig 7 displays the annual et change of maize and wheat under vic gs and vic nonlinear models under the vic gs model the annual et reduction of maize increased gradually from 1 1 mm to 9 3 mm with the elevated c o 2 concentration when considering the effects of g s c o 2 and l a i c o 2 i e vic nonlinear the annual et reduction decreased to some extent the reason is that the decrease in g s reduced water loss but the increase of l a i caused by enhanced photosynthesis offset part of the stomatal effect kergoat et al 2002 for wheat a smaller annual et reduction can be found under the vic nonlinear model the maximum annual et of maize decreased by more than 1 0 while that of wheat decreased by about 0 5 the et response of maize was heavier than that of wheat but what maize and wheat have in common is the et reduction trend the annual et under vic gs and vic nonlinear both showed a decreasing trend in general and the et reduction magnitude increased year by year impacted by g s only the annual average et change was the greatest which was reduced by 0 91 and 0 29 for maize and wheat respectively fig 8 instead l a i exerted an increasing effect on et the annual et of maize and wheat increased by 0 36 and 0 07 respectively when only l a i is considered vic lai for maize the et change by vic gs 0 91 was higher than that by vic lai 0 36 resulting in an et reduction under vic nonlinear 0 54 the impact of l a i c o 2 on the hydrological process is weaker than that of g s c o 2 generally speaking the compensatory effect of g s and l a i ultimately reduced the annual et of maize and wheat by 0 54 and 0 21 respectively 3 2 2 estimation under doubled c o 2 concentration the et reduction under the historical period is relatively small due to low c o 2 concentration however the c o 2 concentration will probably reach 538 ppm and 936 ppm under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 by the year 2100 ipcc 2013 respectively hence a doubled c o 2 concentration was set up to investigate the corresponding et response of maize and wheat the et difference between the doubled 660 ppm c o 2 and baseline 330 ppm c o 2 concentration was calculated fig 9 the annual average et of maize and wheat were 546 mm and 496 mm respectively which were comparable with the other studies over the agricultural land guo et al 2020 ma et al 2020 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 zhao and zhao 2014 the et reduction of maize and wheat was 23 3 mm and 8 9 mm which accounted for 4 3 and 1 8 of the corresponding annual et besides compared with the response under historical c o 2 concentration the annual et reduction of maize and wheat increased from 0 54 to 4 3 and 0 21 to 1 8 respectively nearly ten times the increase the significant et reduction under doubled c o 2 concentration shall not be neglected any more due to its role in reducing crop water requirements 3 3 et response to future scenarios 2020 2100 3 3 1 annual et change under future scenarios the future period 2020 2100 was split into the 2040 s 2020 2060 and the 2080 s 2061 2100 in this study two rcps rcp4 5 rcp8 5 are selected to represent future climate change projected by eight gcms by applying the vic nonlinear model the range of the et reduction under different gcms and rcps are shown in fig 10 the annual et for maize decreased from 10 mm to 40 mm with the elevated c o 2 under rcp8 5 the annual et response under rcp4 5 was about half of that under rcp8 5 the linear trends of et reduction were also found both under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 with the increasing rates of 0 12 mm and 0 35 mm for annual et reduction respectively the et reduction of wheat shared the same trend with maize despite a smaller magnitude fig 11 shows diverse et responses under four combinations of rcps the annual et reduction for maize was much smaller under rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s with a range from 2 to 3 while the et reduction under rcp8 5 2080s reached 5 for some gcms the corresponding annual et reduction was 7 6 mm 10 9 mm 9 6 mm 19 5 mm respectively which is in the range of about 1 1 6 4 the similarity in et reduction between the four scenarios was also found for wheat observations of crops grown under elevated c o 2 face show that an average 5 reduction in et can be expected leakey et al 2009 the larger et reduction for maize was also reported by deryng et al 2016 that c o 2 simulations for 2080 rcp8 5 relative to 2000 decreased et of maize and wheat by 9 2 and 4 4 respectively 3 3 2 comparisons with the baseline condition the comparisons for three climatic forcing precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature over the agricultural land between future scenarios and baseline conditions 1980 2010 were conducted to have an overview of their influence on future et fig 12 as indicated in fig 12 the precipitation shows a decreasing trend except for rcp8 5 2080s with an overall range of 40 20 mm the temperature tends to increase in all cases the most dramatic scenario is rcp8 5 2080s with the largest variation for all forcing on account of the driving forcing for the vic model in this study the et response resulted from climatic forcing only without c o 2 and all four forcing with c o 2 were analyzed separately fig 13 a range from 20 mm to 100 mm et change of maize was detected to decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature though the increasing pattern of et was opposite with decreasing precipitation it was reasonable for the free irrigation scheme applied in the vic model which meant the crop water requirement was fully satisfied with freely available water haddeland et al 2006 chen et al 2018 besides the increasing temperature also promoted the increment of et the comparison between without c o 2 and with c o 2 contributes to evaluate the impact of the different forcing when the c o 2 concentration was complemented as another forcing the increase in et has decreased the et reduction by elevated c o 2 concentration offset some et increase caused by precipitation and temperature changes in summary the effects of elevated c o 2 offset 69 28 et increase caused by the climatic forcing for maize and wheat respectively 4 discussion 4 1 et reduction between history and future the et reduction during the historical period was inconspicuous with 0 54 0 21 for maize for wheat in the studied region fig 8 the small change can be attributed to the lower c o 2 concentration level from 337 9 ppm in 1980 to 389 79 ppm in 2010 and the opposite effect of g s and l a i on et kergoat et al 2002 kimball et al 2002 burkart et al 2011 nevertheless compared with the response under doubled c o 2 concentration 660 ppm the annual et reduction of maize and wheat increased from 0 54 to 4 3 and 0 21 to 1 8 respectively nearly ten times the increase during historical period fig 9 besides the c o 2 concentration under future scenarios will continue to rise 538 ppm 936 ppm under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 by the year 2100 the annual et reduction of maize and wheat was further increased to approximately 5 and 2 respectively under rcp 2080s fig 11 which occupies a considerable proportion of crop water requirements though smaller changes of et were found during the historical period a much more significant et reduction under elevated c o 2 shall not be neglected any more due to its important role in reducing crop water requirements which will be instructive for agriculture irrigation kang et al 2017 4 2 different responses characteristics of maize and wheat the et reduction of wheat under the elevated c o 2 is generally weaker than that of maize under both historical and future periods such a difference for et response between maize and wheat is consistent with other works deryng et al 2016 kang et al 1999 reddy et al 2010 about it different photosynthetic mechanisms are maintained by c 3 and c 4 plants photosynthesis rate for c 4 plants are almost saturated under normal atmospheric c o 2 concentration while that of c 3 plants are not reddy et al 2010 mauney et al 1994 therefore the elevated c o 2 concentration has a larger effect on c 3 plants than on c 4 plants regarding photosynthetic rate triggs et al 2004 ziska et al 1990 and the corresponding growth promotion of c 3 plants are more intense resulting in greater water consumption of c 3 plants while the stomatal conductance is reduced for both c 3 and c 4 plants due to the elevated c o 2 concentration in the atmosphere burkart et al 2011 kimball et al 2002 besides the different crop growth durations for maize and wheat can also contribute to the different et responses the growth duration for wheat from early april to late july is usually shorter than that for maize from late april to late september leading to less et accumulation and the growth duration for maize has experienced the hottest month of the year which enhances the et accordingly ma et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 consequently a smaller et reduction was confirmed for wheat c 3 plants kang et al 1999 reddy et al 2010 the larger et response of maize to elevated c o 2 concentration should be paid more attention in view of the most planting area and large crop water requirement in the agricultural land 4 3 implications for agriculture irrigation the relationship between the variation of c o 2 concentration and the cumulative annual et per 100 mm of irrigation water requirement the irrigation water using coefficient for 1980 2010 was 0 527 chen et al 2018 was shown in fig 14 both maize and wheat showed a significant nonlinear relationship between c o 2 concentration and cumulative annual et per 100 mm irrigation water this relationship was fitted by a quadratic polynomial with high accuracy maize and wheat hold a certain water saving capacity with the elevated c o 2 concentration when the c o 2 concentration was at a low range of 340 350 ppm the et showed little response to c o 2 however the et reduction per 10 ppm increase of c o 2 tends to increase gradually as the c o 2 increased from 2 mm reduction to 4 mm reduction with the c o 2 concentration varying from 360 370 ppm to 370 380 ppm which indicated that the water saving capacity was enhanced by the higher c o 2 for every 100 mm irrigation water the higher the c o 2 concentration the more the et reduction will be the elevated c o 2 concentration will be beneficial for saving irrigation water to a certain degree 4 4 uncertainties and limitations some uncertainties in this study include future scenarios projected by the eight gcms the downscaling method the parameters of the model the future scenarios by ipcc can be improved due to the imperfection of climate models fu et al 2013 the downscaling method applied in this study also needs some improvement jin and sridhar 2012 although these uncertainties are difficult to eliminate we have tried to minimize the uncertainties by using ensemble gcms and evaluating the model performance comprehensively the general conclusions of this study are draw based on these certainly there are several limitations to this research the mitigation and adaptation of the crops under future scenarios were not considered for instance crop phenology may be impacted by future climate change elevated temperature tends to accelerate crop growth and shorten crop growth durations asseng et al 2015 xiao et al 2020 which may change the et response the possible change in spatial distribution for crops under future scenarios is also a limitation here the suitable areas for planting are likely to move northwards due to elevated temperature liu et al 2015 besides the physiological effects of c o 2 on plants are multifaceted li et al 2019 here we only considered the major factors g s and l a i other factors such as crop height were not taken into account a more comprehensive analysis and research will be conducted in future work 5 conclusions the et responses of maize and wheat to elevated c o 2 concentration were studied by improving the representation of g s c o 2 relationship in the vic model the modified nonlinear model had better estimations of et over the agricultural land in the heihe river basin northwest china the et responses to elevated c o 2 under the historical period were relatively small with an annual et reduction of 0 54 and 0 21 for maize and wheat respectively the et reduction due to g s c o 2 was offset by 0 36 and 0 07 by l a i c o 2 under doubled c o 2 concentration the et reduction of maize and wheat were 23 3 mm and 8 9 mm which accounted for 4 3 and 1 8 of the corresponding annual et respectively two rcps and eight gcms were selected to evaluate the et response under future scenarios the annual et response under rcp4 5 was about half of that under rcp8 5 the annual et reductions under four scenarios rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s rcp8 5 2080s were 7 6 mm 10 9 mm 9 6 mm 19 5 mm respectively the effects of elevated c o 2 offset 69 28 et increase caused by climatic forcing for maize and wheat in the studied region the discrepancies between maize and wheat are possibly due to the special photosynthesis mechanism and crop growth durations overall the effects of elevated c o 2 on et have been well demonstrated in this paper this study holds some implications for agriculture irrigation though lower changes of et was found during the historical period the higher et reduction under elevated c o 2 shall not be neglected any more the larger et response of maize should be paid more attention the higher c o 2 concentration the more et reduction will be the elevated c o 2 concentration will be beneficial for saving irrigation water to a certain degree credit authorship contribution statement dehai liao data curation visualization

4929,accurate estimates of root zone soil moisture rzsm at relevant spatio temporal scales are essential for many agricultural and hydrological applications applications of machine learning ml techniques to estimate root zone soil moisture are limited compared to commonly used process based models based on flow and transport equations in the vadose zone however data driven ml techniques present unique opportunities to develop quantitative models without having assumptions on the processes operating within the system being investigated in this study the random forest rf ensemble learning algorithm is tested to demonstrate the capabilities and advantages of ml for rzsm estimation interpolation and extrapolation of rzsm on a daily timescale was carried out using rf over a small agricultural catchment from 2016 to 2018 using in situ measurements results show that rf predictions have slightly higher accuracy for interpolation and similar accuracy for extrapolation in comparison with rzsm simulated from a process based model combined with data assimilation rf predictions for extreme wet and dry conditions were however less accurate this was inferred to be due to infrequent sampling of such conditions that led to poor learning in the trained rf model and to incomplete representation of relevant subsurface processes at the study sites in the rf covariates since rf does not depend on parameters required to estimate subsurface water flow it is more advantageous than a process based model in data poor regions where soil hydraulic parameters are incomplete or missing especially when the primary goal is only the estimation of soil moisture states keywords root zone soil moisture random forest prediction process based modeling 1 introduction root zone soil moisture rzsm is an important environmental variable that impacts hydrological processes relevant for agriculture and climate related studies it is one of the main drivers for agricultural productivity rigden et al 2020 and serves as an indicator for crop water stress which is valuable for drought monitoring bolten et al 2009 outside the hydrological cycle rzsm dynamics play a role in quantifying soil carbon fluxes e g kurc and small 2007 accurate estimates of rzsm are necessary in order to have a better understanding of agricultural and environmental processes it controls direct rzsm measurements can be obtained from in situ sensors installed along the soil profile or at specific depths vereecken et al 2008 dobriyal et al 2012 achieving distributed spatial measurements of rzsm can be a challenge because installation of sensors at the subsurface can be a tedious task and are likely to disturb the soil properties it has become relatively common to extract rzsm from surface soil moisture ssm which may be in situ or satellite derived ulaby et al 1996 since they are more easily obtained satellite derived ssm has the advantage of providing spatially distributed soil moisture while in situ measurements offer higher temporal frequency second or minutes compared to satellites which only provide snapshots at regular time intervals days or weeks analytical solutions are applied in cases when direct rzsm measurements are lacking or insufficient these methods are based on theoretical or empirical relations between environmental variables controlling rzsm state arguably the most common approach is to apply process based hydrological models which are based on conceptual understanding of the system e g cordova and bras 1981 porporato et al 2004 these models employ numerical solutions of flow and transport equations in unsaturated porous media feddes et al 1988 information on soil hydraulic properties either measured directly or from pedo transfer functions schaap et al 2001 van looy et al 2017 are required to estimate water movement across a chosen flow domain it may be necessary to optimize soil hydraulic parameters for instance using inverse modeling e g ritter et al 2003 in order to improve model simulation accuracy the prevailing meteorological conditions as well as variables that describe vegetation growth are necessary to determine the amount of water entering and exiting a given flow domain in the last couple of decades data assimilation methods have been applied to improve process based model estimates houser et al 1998 pezij et al 2019 which may take advantage of satellite derived ssm information data driven methods to estimate rzsm include time series analysis tsa and machine learning ml techniques these methods aim to extract knowledge by evaluating patterns or variability in that data and further stimulate actions that are dictated by the data in the context of rzsm estimation data driven methods implicitly incorporate and evaluate all the interacting processes that produced a given rzsm state tsa methods such as the application of an exponential filter wagner et al 1999 albergel et al 2008 a cumulative distribution function cdf matching gao et al 2019 zhuang et al 2020 or transfer functions pezij et al 2020 primarily utilize surface soil moisture data to derive a functional relation with rzsm however calibration of functional parameters may be necessary each time it is applied to a different study area in order to obtain high accuracy ml algorithms build mathematical models based on training sets and covariates to extract information from data furthermore they are tuned to handle diverse and large volumes of data sets which may be relevant for large scale studies or for operational water management in hydrology and climate studies advances in ml techniques have been applied predominately for prediction and forecasting of environmental variables e g shiri et al 2017 ali et al 2019 kratzert et al 2019 sensitivity or optimization of model parameters e g spear et al 2020 teweldebrhan et al 2020 and uncertainty estimation e g shrestha et al 2009 kayastha et al 2014 application of ml in soil hydrology have also started to gain attention in the last couple of decades for instance ml techniques have been applied to estimate model derived rzsm using artificial neural networks kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 or satellite derive ssm using support vector machines ahmad et al 2010 furthermore ml allows up or downscaling of soil moisture obtained from satellite data srivastava et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 comparison of ml models have been made for forecasting of soil moisture using values at discrete soil moisture depths prasad et al 2018 or soil layers matei et al 2017 at regional scales interestingly ssm has also been estimated from in situ measurements of soil moisture at deeper layers using ml coopersmith et al 2016 in a comparison study karandish and šimnek 2016 showed that ml may provide a useful alternative to process based models using limited input data ml has recently been applied to optimize soil hydraulic parameters such as the saturated hydraulic conductivity araya and ghezzehei 2019 shiri et al 2020 showed that ml specifically random forest rf can accurately simulate subsurface wetting fronts due to drip irrigation in agricultural areas in this study the main goal is to demonstrate the applicability of random forest rf an ensemble ml model to estimate rzsm within a agricultural small catchment among the advantages of rf outlined by tyralis et al 2019 is that it produces consistent predictions and it reduces the variance without increasing the bias of the predictions furthermore rf was selected among the multitude of ml models available in order to balance prediction accuracy with interpretability of the results with respect to the input variables this is facilitated by investigation of the variable importance list which enumerates the covariates with the greatest influence on rf prediction accuracy other ml models especially deep learning methods have succeeded in achieving high prediction accuracies but is still challenged by interpretability and ease of relating results to model covariates montavon et al 2018 reichstein et al 2019 so far there are still limited studies applying rf in soil hydrology particularly in estimations of rzsm applying such a data driven method will ensure that all the processes operating in the system under study are incorporated in the predictive rf model developed in addition there has been proliferation of rzsm in situ measurements in the last couple of decades from various soil moisture monitoring networks worldwide e g international soil moisture network ismn dorigo et al 2011 which provides an excellent opportunity to capitalize on ml techniques in this study an almost three year long dataset of daily measurements in agricultural fields were used for rf modeling in two ways 1 interpolation at randomly selected points within the time series and 2 extrapolation of future rzsm state based on past values a comparison is then made between the rf results and a process based model in order to assess the capabilities of a data driven method a pore flow model with data assimilation via direct insertion of in situ measurements was applied to simulate rzsm at the study sites 2 materials and methods as an overview random forest rf was applied for interpolation and extrapolation of root zone soil moisture rzsm within a small catchment for comparison of results rzsm were also simulated using a process based pb pore flow model which was combined with data assimilation for both methods steps to optimize model hyper parameters were applied to improve model performance and to allow objective comparison of the results briefly a selection of hyperparameters were tuned for rf while the soil hydraulic parameters were optimized via inverse modeling for pb data assimilation via direct insertion of in situ measurements was further applied to improve pb model results the succeeding sections describe in detail the datasets used and methods applied while a summary is shown in fig 1 2 1 raam soil moisture network the raam catchment is located in the southeastern portion of the netherlands which holds mostly sandy soils a total of 15 operational soil moisture stations are distributed across the whole catchment fig 2 at each station soil moisture and temperature sensors decagon ec h20 5tm were installed at 5 10 20 40 and 80 cm depths and measurements were recorded every 15 min the soil moisture stations were located in agricultural fields which are the characteristic land cover type within the catchment area the most common crop type at the stations is grass followed by corn potato sugar beet and other vegetable crops table s1 a more detailed description of the raam soil moisture network is provided in benninga et al 2018 measurements down to 40 cm depth were integrated over a 60 cm averaging depth to calculate root zone soil moisture fig 3 this was chosen in order to have a uniform root zone across the study sites which have varying crop types for grass fields the active root zone may only be up to 20 cm because of its shallow rooting system while for crops such as corn or potato the root zone can extend beyond 1 m nevertheless the depth used for the analysis generally captures the active root zone for the crops at the study sites furthermore the methods applied in this study could also be customized for other depths that would suitably represent the root zone depths root zone soil moisture θ rz is given by 1 θ rz j 1 n θ j δ z j z where θ j in m3 m 3 is the volumetric water content for measurement depth j cm δ z j cm is the thickness of soil associated with the measurement depth and z cm is the total averaging depth measurements from all 15 stations starting from april 2016 up to december 2018 33 months were used for the analysis the daily mean values from the 15 min data were calculated in order to match the resolution of acquired meteorological datasets compared to the soil hydraulic parameters based on bodemfysische eenhedenkaart bofek2012 wosten et al 2013 which is a map of soil hydro physical properties for the netherlands root zone soil moisture calculated using eq 1 did not reach the residual water content θ r value averaged across the study sites however root zone soil moisture were found to reach and for some stations go beyond the average saturated water content θ s based on bofek2012 fig 4 2 2 random forest regression random forest rf is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines the concepts of decision trees and bagging fig 5 breiman 2001 decision trees dt either for classification or regression partition the variable space using a set of hierarchical rules such that the dataset are grouped recursively based on similar instances a set of covariates continuous or categorical variables are used for recursively splitting the values of the variable of interest which results in multiple parent and child nodes that resemble a tree like structure splitting at each node involves random selection of candidate variables from the total number of covariates referred to as the mtry parameter the dt will evaluate each candidate to find the optimal split that maximizes the purity which results in the largest decrease in the impurity at each child node in this case the estimated response variance for regression trees was used as a measure for impurity wright and ziegler 2015 rf creates diverse dts to avoid highly correlated predictors by growing them from different subsets of the training data through a procedure called bagging often a large number of trees are created and is referred to as the ntree parameter bagging an abbreviation for bootstrap aggregation is a technique for generating multiple training data by resampling with replacement of the original training set this means that some data may be used more than once in the training while others might never be used for each bootstrap sample a regression dt generates multiple parent and child nodes until the stopping criterion is reached in this case when the value for the minimum node size min node size parameter is achieved after all the trees are grown the rf regression predictor is the mean from all the predictions from each individual tree more detailed description of rf methods and parameters are given in breiman 2001 and hastie et al 2009 estimation of rzsm using rf was implemented in two ways 1 interpolation of randomly selected points within the whole time series data and 2 extrapolation of future rzsm based on past values for each method a single rf model was built based on the combined measurements from all 15 soil moisture stations in the raam for rf interpolation random samples were obtained from the daily time series data at each station for rf extrapolation the length of the time series at each station was first split based on the sampling proportion used the first part of the time series was selected for training and constitutes the past data while the remaining was used for model validation and constitutes the future data proportions of 50 up to 80 with increments of 10 of the daily time series measurements at each station were used to generate the samples from each station these were then combined into one training set for building each rf model the value of the ntree parameter was made proportional to the samples in each training set and was set to a tenth of the amount of each training set this corresponded to 600 700 900 and 1000 trees for interpolation and 600 800 900 1100 trees extrapolation for each training set 50 60 70 80 of total measurements optimization of rf models were carried out by tuning mtry and min node size parameters for each training set proportion tested 2 2 1 hyperparameter optimization the rf model was tuned in order to select the combination of the hyperparameters mtry and min node size that would yield the highest accuracy hyperparameters are parameters that need to be set prior to training a model and defines the configuration of the regression trees their values directly control the behaviour of the learning algorithm and have a significant effect on the performance of the model being trained other rf model parameters that are not tuned will simply learn on their own during model training the values for mtry will dictate splitting of rzsm values at the nodes of the regression tree while the minimum number of elements per node min node size will serve as a stopping criterion in building the regression trees we tested values of mtry from 1 to 25 and min node size of 5 10 20 and 30 a total of 100 combinations of hyperparameters mtry and min node size were tested for each of the four training set proportions 50 to 80 in the tuning phase a 10 fold cross validation cv scheme was applied to the training set in tuning the hyperparameters this meant that the training set was split and for each k fold a 10th of the training set served as the test sample while the remaining is used for creating the regression trees for each k fold the test sample contains randomly chosen points from the total training set that has not yet been included as a test sample before in previous folds the mean root mean square error rmse computed for each hyperparameter combination in the 10 fold cv scheme were compared to assess model performance i e 100 rmse s aside from having a separate validation set a cv scheme is a preventive measure for model overfitting lever et al 2016 rmse s were examined further to select the final rf model as the one with highest accuracy best model might also be computationally expensive therefore we compared the model with the best rmse to another one that has a faster computation time but comparable rmse as a tradeoff to evaluate a simpler model without sacrificing accuracy rmse s were first ranked from lowest to highest and then a pairwise elimination process was applied by evaluating the improvement in rmse the final tradeoff model was selected once a 1 improvement in rmse was found 2 2 2 random forest covariates covariates or the set of predictor variables used to build rf regression trees include information on meteorological conditions soil properties land cover and vegetation characteristics at each site fig 2 and table 1 daily meteorological data from 36 knmi royal dutch meteorological institute stations distributed within the entire netherlands were interpolated to produce a 5 x 5 km gridded image in order to extract daily values at the location of each soil moisture station spatial estimates of the values at each knmi station were obtained using a thin plate splines interpolation sluiter 2012 temperature wind speed relative humidity sun hours potential evapotranspiration and radiation were selected among the total meteorological datasets available as these were also the input variables in the process based model applied in this study they are therefore indicative of surface processes that influence the rzsm state gridded values of daily rainfall measurements with a 1 x 1 km pixel size were obtained directly from knmi ordinary kriging was applied to around 300 measurement locations of rain gauges distributed across the netherlands to produce the rainfall maps soenario et al 2010 leaf area index lai from an 8 day modis composite with 500 m resolution was used to capture vegetation characteristics over the study sites the values for days in between lai measurements were linearly interpolated to obtain daily estimates both crop type and soil hydro physical groups were also included as categorical covariates the former is based on field observations while the latter was obtained from bofek2012 fig 2 indicates the bofek2012 codes for the soils within the raam network only further description of each code is given in wosten et al 2013 these two categorical variables are re coded into dummy or indicator variables for the rf regression the categorical variables are transformed into a dichotomous 1 or 0 representation of its presence or absence for each data point for example the categorical variable crop with a type corn a value of 1 is assigned for measurements having the said crop and 0 for measurements with another crop type the current soil moisture state is inevitably affected by its past values and past meteorological conditions the so called soil moisture memory or persistence has been widely investigated because of its importance in climate related studies e g koster and suarez 2001 therefore lagged values were also calculated for meteorological and soil moisture datasets in order to incorporate past information in the rf model this may be useful especially for forecasting where only past information is available for surface soil moisture and meteorological datasets values with a lag of 1 day were obtained additional lagged surface soil moisture values of 3 and 40 days were also calculated based on findings of soil moisture memory studies at global mccoll et al 2017 and continental european orth and seneviratne 2012 scale respectively a total of 39 covariates were used for the rf models table 1 2 2 3 rf prediction intervals uncertainties in rf estimates are defined based on the 95 prediction interval pi obtained using quantile regression forest qrf fig 5 the idea behind qrf is that instead of recording the mean value of response variables from the trees all responses for each tree are recorded meinshausen 2006 this allows not only for the estimation of the conditional mean but also a good approximation of the full conditional distribution pis were defined using quantile regression based on the chosen quantiles α s for a given random variable the conditional distribution function f y x x is given by the probability that for x x y is smaller than y for a continuous distribution function the α quantile q α x specifies a value such that the probability of x being smaller than q α x is for a given random variable x x exactly equal to α a 95 pi i 95 for the rzsm estimates is based on 2 5 and 97 5 quantiles q 025 x q 975 x 2 2 4 variable importance variable importance from the rf models determined using a permutation method wright and ziegler 2015 rankings for covariates were based on the mean decrease in model accuracy after shuffling or randomly permuting the values of a predictor x i where i 1 n for each of the covariates used by permuting the values of x i its association with the response variable y i e rzsm is broken therefore if the predictor x i is associated with the response y a substantial decrease in accuracy is expected after prediction using the permuted and remaining non permuted variables 2 3 process based modelling with data assimilation a soil water balance model was carried out to simulate one dimensional daily rzsm at the study sites in a water balance model mass and energy fluxes over time and or space are calculated to estimate soil moisture along the profile we assumed that soil water movement would be restricted along the vertical dimension since the study sites are generally characterized by homogeneously textured soils and the terrain at the study sites is generally flat e g for modeling unsaturated flow in the netherlands de laat 1980 the vertical water flow in unsaturated porous media is solved numerically using richard s equation 2 θ t z k h h z 1 s where t is the time days θ is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 h is the soil water pressure head cm z is the spatial coordinate cm defined as positive upward k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function cm d 1 and s is a sink term representing water uptake by plant roots cm d 1 k h is derived from a water retention curve given by van genuchten 1980 3 θ h θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 4 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e l m m 2 m 1 1 n s e θ θ r θ s θ r where θ r and θ s denote residual and saturated volumetric water contents cm3 cm 3 respectively α cm 1 and n are fitting parameters of soil water characteristic curve k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 l is the pore connectivity parameter and s e is the relative saturation 2 3 1 inverse modeling for parameter optimization the soil water balance was carried in two parts using hydrus 1d software simunek et al 2005 the first part involved optimization of soil parameters describing the shape of the water retention curve θ s θ r α n and hydraulic conductivity curve k s l using inverse modeling we initially carried out simulations using soil hydraulic parameters available from bofek2012 wosten et al 2013 but found the results to be unsatisfactory optimization of soil hydraulic parameters was based on marquardt levenberg parameter estimation method marquardt 1963 as implemented in hydrus 1d using soil water content measurements the soil domain considered is 1 m to cover depths similar to the measurements stations a variable atmospheric condition based on rainfall and evaportranspiration was set as the upper boundary conditions while a free drainage condition was set as the lower boundary conditions daily meteorological datasets from knmi as described in section 2 2 2 were used for the upper boundary conditions initial conditions for the inverse modeling were set to the pressure head at field capacity with the assumption that the soil is close to saturation the start of a year when the simulations commenced in addition simulations from january until april just before the start of the in situ measurements were part of the spin up period for the model a single porosity van genuchten mualem model without hysteresis was used for the simulation the flow domain was subdivided based on the number of soil layers present in bofek2012 table s2 for instance station rm02 was subdivided into two layers while rm15 has only one layer in the flow domain simunek et al 2005 provides more detailed information regarding the theory methods and default parameters in h1d software subsequently the second part was the forward modeling to estimate soil water content using the optimized set of soil hydraulic parameters observation points within the flow domain were selected at the same depths as the in situ measurement points furthermore depth averaged zone weighted root zone soil moisture was calculated in a similar manner as the in situ values 2 3 2 sequential data assimilation data assimilation is an often applied method to improve the accuracy of hydrological modelling using up to date measurements the goal of data assimilation is to combine measurements and modelling efforts into an optimal state estimate of the variable of interest reichle 2008 the difference between machine learning and data assimilation is that the latter depends on a dynamical model of the system in this case h1d to show the added value of the machine learning method we show an application of data assimilation with the modelling instrument used in this study we recognize that data assimilation should use information on uncertainties in both observations and modelling efforts for which sequential methods such as the ensemble kalman filter can be used evensen 2009 houtekamer and mitchell 1998 pezij et al 2019 however in this study we only focus on a simple data assimilation method which is relatively easy implemented houser et al 1998 and heathman et al 2003 showed the value of direction insertion for soil moisture modelling therefore we applied a direct insertion data assimilation method to update the soil moisture state we applied direction insertion by replacing the model state by the in situ measurements for every 20 day interval over the whole simulation period which covered two years measurements along the entire soil profile were used at the end of each 20 day period the model state was replaced by the soil profile provided by the in situ measurements the model was subsequently run for the next 20 day period the said assimilation interval was tested as it approximated the revisit times of some microwave satellites e g radarsat 2 or alos palsar 2 which have been assimilated into process based models in the past the days when data were assimilated were excluded for model evaluation 3 results and discussions 3 1 random forest model tuning the rf models generated using different training sets indicate that the highest and lowest rmses are based on 50 and 80 of the total data for interpolation and 80 and 60 of the total data for extrapolation fig 6 a and b however a 50 training set performed relatively well in both cases based on in very minimal decrease in the rf model performance rmses are only 0 002 m3 m 3 and 0 0003 m3 m 3 higher than those obtained using 80 and 60 training proportion for interpolation and extrapolation respectively furthermore the runtime is fastest with a 50 training set decreasing the computation time of the best performing model by at least 44 e g from 25 to 14 min for extrapolation this aspect is of importance for machine learning techniques especially as the volume of datasets become larger therefore we selected the rf model from a 50 training set for further evaluation of the hyperparameter tuning results using the 50 training automatically meant that ntree 600 was implemented in the rf models for both interpolation and extrapolation a comparison of the results obtained from the tuning process using 50 training set is given in fig 7 the rmses are observed to exponentially decrease with increasing mtry values which is combined with a consistent increase in accuracy with smaller min node size fig 7a and e for both interpolation and extrapolation a large mtry and a small min node size resulted in the best rf model based on rmses fig 7c and g this is somewhat expected because the homogeneity of elements at each node is higher when the min node size value is kept smaller in addition the largest mtry costs the most computing time as expected in contrast the tradeoff model with a smaller mtry value halves the computing time from 25 to 10 s but only has a slightly lower rmse fig 7 bottom panel to balance accuracy and computation time the hyperparameters from the tradeoff model were used further for model evaluation 3 1 1 variable importance based on fig 8 surface soil moisture ssm soil properties and land cover types have larger impacts on rf model accuracy compared to meteorological variables lagged soil moisture values appear higher on the list of important variables vi in the rf model for both interpolation and extrapolation ssm with lags of up to 40 days are still highly relevant in estimating rzsm temperature appears to have the most important effects on rf model performance among all the meteorological covariates included since soil moisture is directly influenced by precipitation it is surprising that current and antecedent rainfall did not rank higher in the vi list rather the impact of precipitation on the rf model may be included within the ssm variables vwc5 and vwc5 lag which ranked highest in the vi list within the raam catchment meteorological conditions among the raam stations were found to be similar due to its small areal coverage fig 9 since rf capitalizes differences or unique values in the covariates to separate rzsm into groups in building the regression trees meteorological variables over the stations may have been less able to differentiate between rzsm among different stations based on the single rf model trained i e one each for interpolation and extrapolation we hypothesize that the influence of meteorological conditions may also be encapsulated within the doy variable which represents effects of seasonal changes on rzsm the combination of doy and temperature may have been adequate for the rf models to estimated rzsm in the raam catchment the results obtained however do not imply that meteorological variables are not important controls for rzsm in this case meteorological variability over the raam catchment were secondary to variability in crop types and soil characteristics among the stations for estimating rzsm using the single rf model developed perhaps representing all the meteorological variables into one or two variables via dimensionality reduction methods e g principal component reddy et al 2020 allows for their impact to be interpreted collectively and may potentially result in a different vi ranking for a consequent rf model 3 2 root zone soil moisture estimation in the raam catchment the rf model performance for stations with the best and worst accuracy obtained from rzsm interpolation and extrapolation are given in fig 10 results for all stations are given in the supplementary fig s1 fig s2 rf interpolations fig 10a and b for rzsm have high accuracy in comparison to rf extrapolations fig 10c and d however the soil moisture dynamics i e an increase or decrease are still captured in the extrapolated values even though soil moisture state may be over or underestimated the accuracy of hydrus 1d h1d simulations are generally lower than rf interpolations but are comparable with rf extrapolations table 2 for instance the values from h1d simulations are closer to in situ values at the station with the worst performing rf extrapolations rm02 the results from rf generally have high r 2 0 75 and low rmses 0 06 m3 m 3 indicating the capability of a data driven method to accurately estimate rzsm they are comparable or may even be better than those from h1d simulations which further adds weight to the utility of the rf model applied differences in accuracy between rf interpolation and extrapolation could be related to the impact of the training samples used to build each respective rf model higher accuracy for rf interpolations have resulted from inclusion of most if not all of the possible rzsm conditions within the raam catchment using the randomly selected training set this may not be the case for the rf extrapolation model trained which consequently contributed to lower accuracy in the validation set the past data used to build the rf extrapolation model may exclude some of the meteorological or soil moisture conditions possible in the raam catchment therefore future soil moisture conditions that are not represented in the training set are unseen or foreign values to the rf model and are more likely to be poorly estimated poor extrapolation of values outside the training set is a known drawback of rf and other similar ml techniques e g hengl et al 2018 this can be resolved by inclusion of the full suite of soil moisture conditions and corresponding covariates in the training dataset however this may not be always possible from in situ measurements since not all soil moisture conditions are encountered in the field within a short time span 5 years remote sensing is seen as an additional source of ssm or rzsm information provided that the spatio temporal resolutions from satellite images matches the intended scale of study another potential complementary dataset are those simulated by process based models especially for extreme meteorological conditions that are not encountered during field measurements inclusion of extreme meteorological conditions modeled by process based models may potentially resolve the range of soil moisture values missing from in situ measurements alone however process based model outputs should also demonstrate acceptable to high accuracy levels in order to be used as inputs for the h1d simulations data assimilation da by direct insertion di of in situ measurements improved the root zone soil moisture estimates h1d simulations at the stations with the highest and lowest rmse s both show improvement after da fig 11 simulations based on soil hydraulic parameters from bofek generally underestimated rzsm values for all the study sites a substantial increase in model accuracy is obtained after optimizing the hydraulic parameters further improvement in the simulation accuracy were obtained after applying da using the di approach model estimates are pushed towards the observations however for some stations a large spike or drop in rzsm estimates are observed immediately after data was assimilated into the simulation the model reverts back to the original state quite quickly which could either imply a suboptimal da sampling interval or that the model physics and or parameters may not be completely adequate in explaining the measurements such effects can be mitigated by applying other types of da e g ensemble kalman filter which allow continuous estimation of model uncertainties however despite some limitations of the di method selected the primary goal was to demonstrate the improvement in model accuracy and therefore other more complex da methods were not further pursued 3 3 model residuals for extreme soil moisture conditions residuals of the model estimates against in situ measurements from all stations in the raam were further assessed to compare the model performance for extreme rzsm conditions accurate rzsm estimates of extremes conditions are vital in understanding the environmental impacts of climate or extreme climatology in contrast to a single overall metric provided by rmse or r 2 residuals allow investigation of specific rzsm values that are poorly estimated using the two methods applied the results from the residual analysis generally reflect the accuracy obtained for rf both inter and extrapolation and h1d as described in the previous section the range of residual values are smaller for rf interpolation and higher for rf extrapolation fig 12 c and h however based on the residuals less accurate estimates are found towards drier and wetter soil moisture values from both rf and h1d the variability in the residuals for extreme conditions representing the 2 5th and 97 5th percentiles equivalent to 0 08 m3 m 3 and 0 38 m3 m 3 from the total dataset distribution are given as boxplots in fig 12 d e i j for the two rf models extreme dry conditions tend to be overestimated while extreme wet conditions tend to be underestimated based on larger than zero residuals for the former and smaller than zero residuals in the latter the degree of over or underestimation is larger for rf extrapolation than rf interpolation furthermore h1d simulations have smaller residuals than rf for extreme dry conditions but have worse estimates for extreme wet conditions since extreme conditions represent only a small proportion of the total dataset the probability of being excluded from the bootstrap samples used for building the regression trees is higher than other frequently encountered soil moisture values this may have resulted to poor learning of the rf model which is clearly demonstrated in the large residuals for rf extrapolations of extreme dry conditions rf extrapolations with a median of 0 05 m3 m 3 mostly overestimated extremely dry conditions and are worse than those from h1d simulations which had a median close to zero aside from the impact of the frequency of extreme conditions to the bootstrap samples large residuals obtained for rf extrapolations and h1d fig 12 d e i j may be related to the covariates used in the former and the type of flow model applied in the latter since only a pore flow model was applied for simulation root zone soil moisture using h1d the impact of preferential flow was excluded in the analysis preferential flow paths generated by biotic activity plant roots or animals are likely to be present at the study sites however additional model parameters for incorporating preferential flow are not readily available for the study sites and would require separate investigation arguably pore flow models are still most widely implemented for practical applications of process based models migration to a framework that routinely incorporates preferential flow might be necessary for modelling at spatial temporal scales where its impact are substantial similarly covariates used in rf also dominantly reflect processes that are important for simulating pore flow as mentioned in section 2 2 2 they were chosen based on the knowledge that they are inputs for the process based model underestimation of the two rf models for extreme wet conditions indicates that the covariates selected may have been insufficient to achieve higher accuracy for those conditions addition of covariates that directly represent or indicate the likelihood of occurrence of preferential flow paths in the soil could potentially be beneficial for the rf model however deriving such covariates remain elusive since there are still theoretical and technological bottlenecks in understanding preferential flows in soils guo and lin 2018 that hamper accurate quantification and representation in spatio temporal maps with resolutions suitable in this study 3 4 utility of data driven methods for rzsm estimation comparison for the results from rf and h1d show that both methods are equally able to accurately estimate rzsm although they operate differently on the one hand process based models determine the rate of water movement along the soil profile which always require soil hydraulic properties one the other hand ml methods such as rf performs focus on patterns that allow hierarchical splitting of the dataset using suitable covariates for both methods techniques are available in order to optimize and improve naively implemented models that can elevate accuracy to acceptable levels the question of utility for different scenarios or applications therefore arises in other words what are the advantages disadvantages of one over the other and how does this affect model selection for a certain application for rf one the of the advantages of a data driven method is its ability to create a single model that will fit very large datasets without any assumption on the system dynamics an rf approach may be attractive for areas with limited information on soil hydraulic properties because it can be applied using easily obtained meteorological and satellite derived variables process based models maybe applied over large areas in a spatially distributed manner but they need to explicitly account for heterogeneity in soil properties by modifying hydraulic parameters and or the type of flow mechanisms expected for different parts of a study area one common supplementary analysis for process based models is to apply pedo transfer functions to estimate soil hydraulic parameters from commonly measured soil properties such as texture and organic matter content rf however circumvents the need to carry out this intermediate and supplementary step by not requiring prior assumptions on the system dynamics thus not anchoring its estimates on soil hydraulic properties for this study another difference between the two models applied is the use of ssm values in developing the rf model although theoretically rf could be carried out excluding ssm the results from the variable importance list show that ssm is relevant for achieving good model performance satelite derived ssm is a good alternative for the rf model in cases where in situ measurements are insufficient lastly high rf accuracy for prediction of soil moisture values further opens opportunities for filling data gaps in highly non linear time series datasets the increasing amount of available soil moisture measurements globally could be a resource for expanding the application of data driven methods in soil hydrology similar to what is carried out in this study creation of a single model from numerous soil moisture networks could potentially allow for operational rzsm prediction or forecasting at different spatio temporal scales in situations where the primary goal is to determine the soil moisture state rf is a good approach as it can be applied based on accessible surficial datasets however it is not capable of determining the dominant processes that control the soil moisture state although a hint may be provided in the important variables list identified by the rf model the impact of certain processes on soil moisture state may be better analyzed using a process based model the context in which each method may be the better option is summarized in fig 13 4 conclusions in this study we demonstrated the capabilities of a data driven method using random forest for estimating root zone soil moisture with high accuracy similar to process based models it may be advantageous to apply a random forest framework for areas with limited information on soil hydraulic properties and may circumvent the need to apply pedo transfer functions increasing availability of soil moisture datasets from in situ measurements worldwide and from satellites provide opportunities in data driven methods for large scale studies or operational water management the results from the random forest model does not explicitly elaborate on process controlling soil moisture state and may suffer from poor extrapolation results it does however provide the important variables influencing the prediction accuracy which already hints at factors controlling soil moisture variability credit authorship contribution statement coleen carranza

4929,accurate estimates of root zone soil moisture rzsm at relevant spatio temporal scales are essential for many agricultural and hydrological applications applications of machine learning ml techniques to estimate root zone soil moisture are limited compared to commonly used process based models based on flow and transport equations in the vadose zone however data driven ml techniques present unique opportunities to develop quantitative models without having assumptions on the processes operating within the system being investigated in this study the random forest rf ensemble learning algorithm is tested to demonstrate the capabilities and advantages of ml for rzsm estimation interpolation and extrapolation of rzsm on a daily timescale was carried out using rf over a small agricultural catchment from 2016 to 2018 using in situ measurements results show that rf predictions have slightly higher accuracy for interpolation and similar accuracy for extrapolation in comparison with rzsm simulated from a process based model combined with data assimilation rf predictions for extreme wet and dry conditions were however less accurate this was inferred to be due to infrequent sampling of such conditions that led to poor learning in the trained rf model and to incomplete representation of relevant subsurface processes at the study sites in the rf covariates since rf does not depend on parameters required to estimate subsurface water flow it is more advantageous than a process based model in data poor regions where soil hydraulic parameters are incomplete or missing especially when the primary goal is only the estimation of soil moisture states keywords root zone soil moisture random forest prediction process based modeling 1 introduction root zone soil moisture rzsm is an important environmental variable that impacts hydrological processes relevant for agriculture and climate related studies it is one of the main drivers for agricultural productivity rigden et al 2020 and serves as an indicator for crop water stress which is valuable for drought monitoring bolten et al 2009 outside the hydrological cycle rzsm dynamics play a role in quantifying soil carbon fluxes e g kurc and small 2007 accurate estimates of rzsm are necessary in order to have a better understanding of agricultural and environmental processes it controls direct rzsm measurements can be obtained from in situ sensors installed along the soil profile or at specific depths vereecken et al 2008 dobriyal et al 2012 achieving distributed spatial measurements of rzsm can be a challenge because installation of sensors at the subsurface can be a tedious task and are likely to disturb the soil properties it has become relatively common to extract rzsm from surface soil moisture ssm which may be in situ or satellite derived ulaby et al 1996 since they are more easily obtained satellite derived ssm has the advantage of providing spatially distributed soil moisture while in situ measurements offer higher temporal frequency second or minutes compared to satellites which only provide snapshots at regular time intervals days or weeks analytical solutions are applied in cases when direct rzsm measurements are lacking or insufficient these methods are based on theoretical or empirical relations between environmental variables controlling rzsm state arguably the most common approach is to apply process based hydrological models which are based on conceptual understanding of the system e g cordova and bras 1981 porporato et al 2004 these models employ numerical solutions of flow and transport equations in unsaturated porous media feddes et al 1988 information on soil hydraulic properties either measured directly or from pedo transfer functions schaap et al 2001 van looy et al 2017 are required to estimate water movement across a chosen flow domain it may be necessary to optimize soil hydraulic parameters for instance using inverse modeling e g ritter et al 2003 in order to improve model simulation accuracy the prevailing meteorological conditions as well as variables that describe vegetation growth are necessary to determine the amount of water entering and exiting a given flow domain in the last couple of decades data assimilation methods have been applied to improve process based model estimates houser et al 1998 pezij et al 2019 which may take advantage of satellite derived ssm information data driven methods to estimate rzsm include time series analysis tsa and machine learning ml techniques these methods aim to extract knowledge by evaluating patterns or variability in that data and further stimulate actions that are dictated by the data in the context of rzsm estimation data driven methods implicitly incorporate and evaluate all the interacting processes that produced a given rzsm state tsa methods such as the application of an exponential filter wagner et al 1999 albergel et al 2008 a cumulative distribution function cdf matching gao et al 2019 zhuang et al 2020 or transfer functions pezij et al 2020 primarily utilize surface soil moisture data to derive a functional relation with rzsm however calibration of functional parameters may be necessary each time it is applied to a different study area in order to obtain high accuracy ml algorithms build mathematical models based on training sets and covariates to extract information from data furthermore they are tuned to handle diverse and large volumes of data sets which may be relevant for large scale studies or for operational water management in hydrology and climate studies advances in ml techniques have been applied predominately for prediction and forecasting of environmental variables e g shiri et al 2017 ali et al 2019 kratzert et al 2019 sensitivity or optimization of model parameters e g spear et al 2020 teweldebrhan et al 2020 and uncertainty estimation e g shrestha et al 2009 kayastha et al 2014 application of ml in soil hydrology have also started to gain attention in the last couple of decades for instance ml techniques have been applied to estimate model derived rzsm using artificial neural networks kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 or satellite derive ssm using support vector machines ahmad et al 2010 furthermore ml allows up or downscaling of soil moisture obtained from satellite data srivastava et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 comparison of ml models have been made for forecasting of soil moisture using values at discrete soil moisture depths prasad et al 2018 or soil layers matei et al 2017 at regional scales interestingly ssm has also been estimated from in situ measurements of soil moisture at deeper layers using ml coopersmith et al 2016 in a comparison study karandish and šimnek 2016 showed that ml may provide a useful alternative to process based models using limited input data ml has recently been applied to optimize soil hydraulic parameters such as the saturated hydraulic conductivity araya and ghezzehei 2019 shiri et al 2020 showed that ml specifically random forest rf can accurately simulate subsurface wetting fronts due to drip irrigation in agricultural areas in this study the main goal is to demonstrate the applicability of random forest rf an ensemble ml model to estimate rzsm within a agricultural small catchment among the advantages of rf outlined by tyralis et al 2019 is that it produces consistent predictions and it reduces the variance without increasing the bias of the predictions furthermore rf was selected among the multitude of ml models available in order to balance prediction accuracy with interpretability of the results with respect to the input variables this is facilitated by investigation of the variable importance list which enumerates the covariates with the greatest influence on rf prediction accuracy other ml models especially deep learning methods have succeeded in achieving high prediction accuracies but is still challenged by interpretability and ease of relating results to model covariates montavon et al 2018 reichstein et al 2019 so far there are still limited studies applying rf in soil hydrology particularly in estimations of rzsm applying such a data driven method will ensure that all the processes operating in the system under study are incorporated in the predictive rf model developed in addition there has been proliferation of rzsm in situ measurements in the last couple of decades from various soil moisture monitoring networks worldwide e g international soil moisture network ismn dorigo et al 2011 which provides an excellent opportunity to capitalize on ml techniques in this study an almost three year long dataset of daily measurements in agricultural fields were used for rf modeling in two ways 1 interpolation at randomly selected points within the time series and 2 extrapolation of future rzsm state based on past values a comparison is then made between the rf results and a process based model in order to assess the capabilities of a data driven method a pore flow model with data assimilation via direct insertion of in situ measurements was applied to simulate rzsm at the study sites 2 materials and methods as an overview random forest rf was applied for interpolation and extrapolation of root zone soil moisture rzsm within a small catchment for comparison of results rzsm were also simulated using a process based pb pore flow model which was combined with data assimilation for both methods steps to optimize model hyper parameters were applied to improve model performance and to allow objective comparison of the results briefly a selection of hyperparameters were tuned for rf while the soil hydraulic parameters were optimized via inverse modeling for pb data assimilation via direct insertion of in situ measurements was further applied to improve pb model results the succeeding sections describe in detail the datasets used and methods applied while a summary is shown in fig 1 2 1 raam soil moisture network the raam catchment is located in the southeastern portion of the netherlands which holds mostly sandy soils a total of 15 operational soil moisture stations are distributed across the whole catchment fig 2 at each station soil moisture and temperature sensors decagon ec h20 5tm were installed at 5 10 20 40 and 80 cm depths and measurements were recorded every 15 min the soil moisture stations were located in agricultural fields which are the characteristic land cover type within the catchment area the most common crop type at the stations is grass followed by corn potato sugar beet and other vegetable crops table s1 a more detailed description of the raam soil moisture network is provided in benninga et al 2018 measurements down to 40 cm depth were integrated over a 60 cm averaging depth to calculate root zone soil moisture fig 3 this was chosen in order to have a uniform root zone across the study sites which have varying crop types for grass fields the active root zone may only be up to 20 cm because of its shallow rooting system while for crops such as corn or potato the root zone can extend beyond 1 m nevertheless the depth used for the analysis generally captures the active root zone for the crops at the study sites furthermore the methods applied in this study could also be customized for other depths that would suitably represent the root zone depths root zone soil moisture θ rz is given by 1 θ rz j 1 n θ j δ z j z where θ j in m3 m 3 is the volumetric water content for measurement depth j cm δ z j cm is the thickness of soil associated with the measurement depth and z cm is the total averaging depth measurements from all 15 stations starting from april 2016 up to december 2018 33 months were used for the analysis the daily mean values from the 15 min data were calculated in order to match the resolution of acquired meteorological datasets compared to the soil hydraulic parameters based on bodemfysische eenhedenkaart bofek2012 wosten et al 2013 which is a map of soil hydro physical properties for the netherlands root zone soil moisture calculated using eq 1 did not reach the residual water content θ r value averaged across the study sites however root zone soil moisture were found to reach and for some stations go beyond the average saturated water content θ s based on bofek2012 fig 4 2 2 random forest regression random forest rf is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines the concepts of decision trees and bagging fig 5 breiman 2001 decision trees dt either for classification or regression partition the variable space using a set of hierarchical rules such that the dataset are grouped recursively based on similar instances a set of covariates continuous or categorical variables are used for recursively splitting the values of the variable of interest which results in multiple parent and child nodes that resemble a tree like structure splitting at each node involves random selection of candidate variables from the total number of covariates referred to as the mtry parameter the dt will evaluate each candidate to find the optimal split that maximizes the purity which results in the largest decrease in the impurity at each child node in this case the estimated response variance for regression trees was used as a measure for impurity wright and ziegler 2015 rf creates diverse dts to avoid highly correlated predictors by growing them from different subsets of the training data through a procedure called bagging often a large number of trees are created and is referred to as the ntree parameter bagging an abbreviation for bootstrap aggregation is a technique for generating multiple training data by resampling with replacement of the original training set this means that some data may be used more than once in the training while others might never be used for each bootstrap sample a regression dt generates multiple parent and child nodes until the stopping criterion is reached in this case when the value for the minimum node size min node size parameter is achieved after all the trees are grown the rf regression predictor is the mean from all the predictions from each individual tree more detailed description of rf methods and parameters are given in breiman 2001 and hastie et al 2009 estimation of rzsm using rf was implemented in two ways 1 interpolation of randomly selected points within the whole time series data and 2 extrapolation of future rzsm based on past values for each method a single rf model was built based on the combined measurements from all 15 soil moisture stations in the raam for rf interpolation random samples were obtained from the daily time series data at each station for rf extrapolation the length of the time series at each station was first split based on the sampling proportion used the first part of the time series was selected for training and constitutes the past data while the remaining was used for model validation and constitutes the future data proportions of 50 up to 80 with increments of 10 of the daily time series measurements at each station were used to generate the samples from each station these were then combined into one training set for building each rf model the value of the ntree parameter was made proportional to the samples in each training set and was set to a tenth of the amount of each training set this corresponded to 600 700 900 and 1000 trees for interpolation and 600 800 900 1100 trees extrapolation for each training set 50 60 70 80 of total measurements optimization of rf models were carried out by tuning mtry and min node size parameters for each training set proportion tested 2 2 1 hyperparameter optimization the rf model was tuned in order to select the combination of the hyperparameters mtry and min node size that would yield the highest accuracy hyperparameters are parameters that need to be set prior to training a model and defines the configuration of the regression trees their values directly control the behaviour of the learning algorithm and have a significant effect on the performance of the model being trained other rf model parameters that are not tuned will simply learn on their own during model training the values for mtry will dictate splitting of rzsm values at the nodes of the regression tree while the minimum number of elements per node min node size will serve as a stopping criterion in building the regression trees we tested values of mtry from 1 to 25 and min node size of 5 10 20 and 30 a total of 100 combinations of hyperparameters mtry and min node size were tested for each of the four training set proportions 50 to 80 in the tuning phase a 10 fold cross validation cv scheme was applied to the training set in tuning the hyperparameters this meant that the training set was split and for each k fold a 10th of the training set served as the test sample while the remaining is used for creating the regression trees for each k fold the test sample contains randomly chosen points from the total training set that has not yet been included as a test sample before in previous folds the mean root mean square error rmse computed for each hyperparameter combination in the 10 fold cv scheme were compared to assess model performance i e 100 rmse s aside from having a separate validation set a cv scheme is a preventive measure for model overfitting lever et al 2016 rmse s were examined further to select the final rf model as the one with highest accuracy best model might also be computationally expensive therefore we compared the model with the best rmse to another one that has a faster computation time but comparable rmse as a tradeoff to evaluate a simpler model without sacrificing accuracy rmse s were first ranked from lowest to highest and then a pairwise elimination process was applied by evaluating the improvement in rmse the final tradeoff model was selected once a 1 improvement in rmse was found 2 2 2 random forest covariates covariates or the set of predictor variables used to build rf regression trees include information on meteorological conditions soil properties land cover and vegetation characteristics at each site fig 2 and table 1 daily meteorological data from 36 knmi royal dutch meteorological institute stations distributed within the entire netherlands were interpolated to produce a 5 x 5 km gridded image in order to extract daily values at the location of each soil moisture station spatial estimates of the values at each knmi station were obtained using a thin plate splines interpolation sluiter 2012 temperature wind speed relative humidity sun hours potential evapotranspiration and radiation were selected among the total meteorological datasets available as these were also the input variables in the process based model applied in this study they are therefore indicative of surface processes that influence the rzsm state gridded values of daily rainfall measurements with a 1 x 1 km pixel size were obtained directly from knmi ordinary kriging was applied to around 300 measurement locations of rain gauges distributed across the netherlands to produce the rainfall maps soenario et al 2010 leaf area index lai from an 8 day modis composite with 500 m resolution was used to capture vegetation characteristics over the study sites the values for days in between lai measurements were linearly interpolated to obtain daily estimates both crop type and soil hydro physical groups were also included as categorical covariates the former is based on field observations while the latter was obtained from bofek2012 fig 2 indicates the bofek2012 codes for the soils within the raam network only further description of each code is given in wosten et al 2013 these two categorical variables are re coded into dummy or indicator variables for the rf regression the categorical variables are transformed into a dichotomous 1 or 0 representation of its presence or absence for each data point for example the categorical variable crop with a type corn a value of 1 is assigned for measurements having the said crop and 0 for measurements with another crop type the current soil moisture state is inevitably affected by its past values and past meteorological conditions the so called soil moisture memory or persistence has been widely investigated because of its importance in climate related studies e g koster and suarez 2001 therefore lagged values were also calculated for meteorological and soil moisture datasets in order to incorporate past information in the rf model this may be useful especially for forecasting where only past information is available for surface soil moisture and meteorological datasets values with a lag of 1 day were obtained additional lagged surface soil moisture values of 3 and 40 days were also calculated based on findings of soil moisture memory studies at global mccoll et al 2017 and continental european orth and seneviratne 2012 scale respectively a total of 39 covariates were used for the rf models table 1 2 2 3 rf prediction intervals uncertainties in rf estimates are defined based on the 95 prediction interval pi obtained using quantile regression forest qrf fig 5 the idea behind qrf is that instead of recording the mean value of response variables from the trees all responses for each tree are recorded meinshausen 2006 this allows not only for the estimation of the conditional mean but also a good approximation of the full conditional distribution pis were defined using quantile regression based on the chosen quantiles α s for a given random variable the conditional distribution function f y x x is given by the probability that for x x y is smaller than y for a continuous distribution function the α quantile q α x specifies a value such that the probability of x being smaller than q α x is for a given random variable x x exactly equal to α a 95 pi i 95 for the rzsm estimates is based on 2 5 and 97 5 quantiles q 025 x q 975 x 2 2 4 variable importance variable importance from the rf models determined using a permutation method wright and ziegler 2015 rankings for covariates were based on the mean decrease in model accuracy after shuffling or randomly permuting the values of a predictor x i where i 1 n for each of the covariates used by permuting the values of x i its association with the response variable y i e rzsm is broken therefore if the predictor x i is associated with the response y a substantial decrease in accuracy is expected after prediction using the permuted and remaining non permuted variables 2 3 process based modelling with data assimilation a soil water balance model was carried out to simulate one dimensional daily rzsm at the study sites in a water balance model mass and energy fluxes over time and or space are calculated to estimate soil moisture along the profile we assumed that soil water movement would be restricted along the vertical dimension since the study sites are generally characterized by homogeneously textured soils and the terrain at the study sites is generally flat e g for modeling unsaturated flow in the netherlands de laat 1980 the vertical water flow in unsaturated porous media is solved numerically using richard s equation 2 θ t z k h h z 1 s where t is the time days θ is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 h is the soil water pressure head cm z is the spatial coordinate cm defined as positive

genuchten 1980 3 θ h θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 4 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e l m m 2 m 1 1 n s e θ θ r θ s θ r where θ r and θ s denote residual and saturated volumetric water contents cm3 cm 3 respectively α

inverse modeling for parameter optimization the soil water balance was carried in two parts using hydrus 1d software simunek et al 2005 the first part involved optimization of soil parameters describing the shape of the water retention curve θ s θ r α n and hydraulic conductivity curve k s l using inverse modeling we initially carried out simulations using soil hydraulic parameters available from bofek2012 wosten et al 2013 but found the results to be unsatisfactory optimization of soil hydraulic parameters was based on marquardt levenberg parameter estimation method marquardt 1963 as implemented in hydrus 1d using soil water content measurements the soil domain considered is 1 m to cover depths similar to the measurements stations a variable atmospheric condition based on rainfall and evaportranspiration was set as the upper boundary conditions while a free drainage condition was set as the lower boundary conditions daily meteorological datasets from knmi as described in section 2 2 2 were used for the upper boundary conditions initial conditions for the inverse modeling were set to the pressure head at field capacity with the assumption that the soil is close to saturation the start of a year when the simulations commenced in addition simulations from january until april just before the start of the in situ measurements were part of the spin up period for the model a single porosity van genuchten mualem model without hysteresis was used for the simulation the flow domain was subdivided based on the number of soil layers present in bofek2012 table s2 for instance station rm02 was subdivided into two layers while rm15 has only one layer in the flow domain simunek et al 2005 provides more detailed information regarding the theory methods and default parameters in h1d software subsequently the second part was the forward modeling to estimate soil water content using the optimized set of soil hydraulic parameters observation points within the flow domain were selected at the same depths as the in situ measurement points furthermore depth averaged zone weighted root zone soil moisture was calculated in a similar manner as the in situ values 2 3 2 sequential data assimilation data assimilation is an often applied method to improve the accuracy of hydrological modelling using up to date measurements the goal of data assimilation is to combine measurements and modelling efforts into an optimal state estimate of the variable of interest reichle 2008 the difference between machine learning and data assimilation is that the latter depends on a dynamical model of the system in this case h1d to show the added value of the machine learning method we show an application of data assimilation with the modelling instrument used in this study we recognize that data assimilation should use information on uncertainties in both observations and modelling efforts for which sequential methods such as the ensemble kalman filter can be used evensen 2009 houtekamer and mitchell 1998 pezij et al 2019 however in this study we only focus on a simple data assimilation method which is relatively easy implemented houser et al 1998 and heathman et al 2003 showed the value of direction insertion for soil moisture modelling therefore we applied a direct insertion data assimilation method to update the soil moisture state we applied direction insertion by replacing the model state by the in situ measurements for every 20 day interval over the whole simulation period which covered two years measurements along the entire soil profile were used at the end of each 20 day period the model state was replaced by the soil profile provided by the in situ measurements the model was subsequently run for the next 20 day period the said assimilation interval was tested as it approximated the revisit times of some microwave satellites e g radarsat 2 or alos palsar 2 which have been assimilated into process based models in the past the days when data were assimilated were excluded for model evaluation 3 results and discussions 3 1 random forest model tuning the rf models generated using different training sets indicate that the highest and lowest rmses are based on 50 and 80 of the total data for interpolation and 80 and 60 of the total data for extrapolation fig 6 a and b however a 50 training set performed relatively well in both cases based on in very minimal decrease in the rf model performance rmses are only 0 002 m3 m 3 and 0 0003 m3 m 3 higher than those obtained using 80 and 60 training proportion for interpolation and extrapolation respectively furthermore the runtime is fastest with a 50 training set decreasing the computation time of the best performing model by at least 44 e g from 25 to 14 min for extrapolation this aspect is of importance for machine learning techniques especially as the volume of datasets become larger therefore we selected the rf model from a 50 training set for further evaluation of the hyperparameter tuning results using the 50 training automatically meant that ntree 600 was implemented in the rf models for both interpolation and extrapolation a comparison of the results obtained from the tuning process using 50 training set is given in fig 7 the rmses are observed to exponentially decrease with increasing mtry values which is combined with a consistent increase in accuracy with smaller min node size fig 7a and e for both interpolation and extrapolation a large mtry and a small min node size resulted in the best rf model based on rmses fig 7c and g this is somewhat expected because the homogeneity of elements at each node is higher when the min node size value is kept smaller in addition the largest mtry costs the most computing time as expected in contrast the tradeoff model with a smaller mtry value halves the computing time from 25 to 10 s but only has a slightly lower rmse fig 7 bottom panel to balance accuracy and computation time the hyperparameters from the tradeoff model were used further for model evaluation 3 1 1 variable importance based on fig 8 surface soil moisture ssm soil properties and land cover types have larger impacts on rf model accuracy compared to meteorological variables lagged soil moisture values appear higher on the list of important variables vi in the rf model for both interpolation and extrapolation ssm with lags of up to 40 days are still highly relevant in estimating rzsm temperature appears to have the most important effects on rf model performance among all the meteorological covariates included since soil moisture is directly influenced by precipitation it is surprising that current and antecedent rainfall did not rank higher in the vi list rather the impact of precipitation on the rf model may be included within the ssm variables vwc5 and vwc5 lag which ranked highest in the vi list within the raam catchment meteorological conditions among the raam stations were found to be similar due to its small areal coverage fig 9 since rf capitalizes differences or unique values in the covariates to separate rzsm into groups in building the regression trees meteorological variables over the stations may have been less able to differentiate between rzsm among different stations based on the single rf model trained i e one each for interpolation and extrapolation we hypothesize that the influence of meteorological conditions may also be encapsulated within the doy variable which represents effects of seasonal changes on rzsm the combination of doy and temperature may have been adequate for the rf models to estimated rzsm in the raam catchment the results obtained however do not imply that meteorological variables are not important controls for rzsm in this case meteorological variability over the raam catchment were secondary to variability in crop types and soil characteristics among the stations for estimating rzsm using the single rf model developed perhaps representing all the meteorological variables into one or two variables via dimensionality reduction methods e g principal component reddy et al 2020 allows for their impact to be interpreted collectively and may potentially result in a different vi ranking for a consequent rf model 3 2 root zone soil moisture estimation in the raam catchment the rf model performance for stations with the best and worst accuracy obtained from rzsm interpolation and extrapolation are given in fig 10 results for all stations are given in the supplementary fig s1 fig s2 rf interpolations fig 10a and b for rzsm have high accuracy in comparison to rf extrapolations fig 10c and d however the soil moisture dynamics i e an increase or decrease are still captured in the extrapolated values even though soil moisture state may be over or underestimated the accuracy of hydrus 1d h1d simulations are generally lower than rf interpolations but are comparable with rf extrapolations table 2 for instance the values from h1d simulations are closer to in situ values at the station with the worst performing rf extrapolations rm02 the results from rf generally have high r 2 0 75 and low rmses 0 06 m3 m 3 indicating the capability of a data driven method to accurately estimate rzsm they are comparable or may even be better than those from h1d simulations which further adds weight to the utility of the rf model applied differences in accuracy between rf interpolation and extrapolation could be related to the impact of the training samples used to build each respective rf model higher accuracy for rf interpolations have resulted from inclusion of most if not all of the possible rzsm conditions within the raam catchment using the randomly selected training set this may not be the case for the rf extrapolation model trained which consequently contributed to lower accuracy in the validation set the past data used to build the rf extrapolation model may exclude some of the meteorological or soil moisture conditions possible in the raam catchment therefore future soil moisture conditions that are not represented in the training set are unseen or foreign values to the rf model and are more likely to be poorly estimated poor extrapolation of values outside the training set is a known drawback of rf and other similar ml techniques e g hengl et al 2018 this can be resolved by inclusion of the full suite of soil moisture conditions and corresponding covariates in the training dataset however this may not be always possible from in situ measurements since not all soil moisture conditions are encountered in the field within a short time span 5 years remote sensing is seen as an additional source of ssm or rzsm information provided that the spatio temporal resolutions from satellite images matches the intended scale of study another potential complementary dataset are those simulated by process based models especially for extreme meteorological conditions that are not encountered during field measurements inclusion of extreme meteorological conditions modeled by process based models may potentially resolve the range of soil moisture values missing from in situ measurements alone however process based model outputs should also demonstrate acceptable to high accuracy levels in order to be used as inputs for the h1d simulations data assimilation da by direct insertion di of in situ measurements improved the root zone soil moisture estimates h1d simulations at the stations with the highest and lowest rmse s both show improvement after da fig 11 simulations based on soil hydraulic parameters from bofek generally underestimated rzsm values for all the study sites a substantial increase in model accuracy is obtained after optimizing the hydraulic parameters further improvement in the simulation accuracy were obtained after applying da using the di approach model estimates are pushed towards the observations however for some stations a large spike or drop in rzsm estimates are observed immediately after data was assimilated into the simulation the model reverts back to the original state quite quickly which could either imply a suboptimal da sampling interval or that the model physics and or parameters may not be completely adequate in explaining the measurements such effects can be mitigated by applying other types of da e g ensemble kalman filter which allow continuous estimation of model uncertainties however despite some limitations of the di method selected the primary goal was to demonstrate the improvement in model accuracy and therefore other more complex da methods were not further pursued 3 3 model residuals for extreme soil moisture conditions residuals of the model estimates against in situ measurements from all stations in the raam were further assessed to compare the model performance for extreme rzsm conditions accurate rzsm estimates of extremes conditions are vital in understanding the environmental impacts of climate or extreme climatology in contrast to a single overall metric provided by rmse or r 2 residuals allow investigation of specific rzsm values that are poorly estimated using the two methods applied the results from the residual analysis generally reflect the accuracy obtained for rf both inter and extrapolation and h1d as described in the previous section the range of residual values are smaller for rf interpolation and higher for rf extrapolation fig 12 c and h however based on the residuals less accurate estimates are found towards drier and wetter soil moisture values from both rf and h1d the variability in the residuals for extreme conditions representing the 2 5th and 97 5th percentiles equivalent to 0 08 m3 m 3 and 0 38 m3 m 3 from the total dataset distribution are given as boxplots in fig 12 d e i j for the two rf models extreme dry conditions tend to be overestimated while extreme wet conditions tend to be underestimated based on larger than zero residuals for the former and smaller than zero residuals in the latter the degree of over or underestimation is larger for rf extrapolation than rf interpolation furthermore h1d simulations have smaller residuals than rf for extreme dry conditions but have worse estimates for extreme wet conditions since extreme conditions represent only a small proportion of the total dataset the probability of being excluded from the bootstrap samples used for building the regression trees is higher than other frequently encountered soil moisture values this may have resulted to poor learning of the rf model which is clearly demonstrated in the large residuals for rf extrapolations of extreme dry conditions rf extrapolations with a median of 0 05 m3 m 3 mostly overestimated extremely dry conditions and are worse than those from h1d simulations which had a median close to zero aside from the impact of the frequency of extreme conditions to the bootstrap samples large residuals obtained for rf extrapolations and h1d fig 12 d e i j may be related to the covariates used in the former and the type of flow model applied in the latter since only a pore flow model was applied for simulation root zone soil moisture using h1d the impact of preferential flow was excluded in the analysis preferential flow paths generated by biotic activity plant roots or animals are likely to be present at the study sites however additional model parameters for incorporating preferential flow are not readily available for the study sites and would require separate investigation arguably pore flow models are still most widely implemented for practical applications of process based models migration to a framework that routinely incorporates preferential flow might be necessary for modelling at spatial temporal scales where its impact are substantial similarly covariates used in rf also dominantly reflect processes that are important for simulating pore flow as mentioned in section 2 2 2 they were chosen based on the knowledge that they are inputs for the process based model underestimation of the two rf models for extreme wet conditions indicates that the covariates selected may have been insufficient to achieve higher accuracy for those conditions addition of covariates that directly represent or indicate the likelihood of occurrence of preferential flow paths in the soil could potentially be beneficial for the rf model however deriving such covariates remain elusive since there are still theoretical and technological bottlenecks in understanding preferential flows in soils guo and lin 2018 that hamper accurate quantification and representation in spatio temporal maps with resolutions suitable in this study 3 4 utility of data driven methods for rzsm estimation comparison for the results from rf and h1d show that both methods are equally able to accurately estimate rzsm although they operate differently on the one hand process based models determine the rate of water movement along the soil profile which always require soil hydraulic properties one the other hand ml methods such as rf performs focus on patterns that allow hierarchical splitting of the dataset using suitable covariates for both methods techniques are available in order to optimize and improve naively implemented models that can elevate accuracy to acceptable levels the question of utility for different scenarios or applications therefore arises in other words what are the advantages disadvantages of one over the other and how does this affect model selection for a certain application for rf one the of the advantages of a data driven method is its ability to create a single model that will fit very large datasets without any assumption on the system dynamics an rf approach may be attractive for areas with limited information on soil hydraulic properties because it can be applied using easily obtained meteorological and satellite derived variables process based models maybe applied over large areas in a spatially distributed manner but they need to explicitly account for heterogeneity in soil properties by modifying hydraulic parameters and or the type of flow mechanisms expected for different parts of a study area one common supplementary analysis for process based models is to apply pedo transfer functions to estimate soil hydraulic parameters from commonly measured soil properties such as texture and organic matter content rf however circumvents the need to carry out this intermediate and supplementary step by not requiring prior assumptions on the system dynamics thus not anchoring its estimates on soil hydraulic properties for this study another difference between the two models applied is the use of ssm values in developing the rf model although theoretically rf could be carried out excluding ssm the results from the variable importance list show that ssm is relevant for achieving good model performance satelite derived ssm is a good alternative for the rf model in cases where in situ measurements are insufficient lastly high rf accuracy for prediction of soil moisture values further opens opportunities for filling data gaps in highly non linear time series datasets the increasing amount of available soil moisture measurements globally could be a resource for expanding the application of data driven methods in soil hydrology similar to what is carried out in this study creation of a single model from numerous soil moisture networks could potentially allow for operational rzsm prediction or forecasting at different spatio temporal scales in situations where the primary goal is to determine the soil moisture state rf is a good approach as it can be applied based on accessible surficial datasets however it is not capable of determining the dominant processes that control the soil moisture state although a hint may be provided in the important variables list identified by the rf model the impact of certain processes on soil moisture state may be better analyzed using a process based model the context in which each method may be the better option is summarized in fig 13 4 conclusions in this study we demonstrated the capabilities of a data driven method using random forest for estimating root zone soil moisture with high accuracy similar to process based models it may be advantageous to apply a random forest framework for areas with limited information on soil hydraulic properties and may circumvent the need to apply pedo transfer functions increasing availability of soil moisture datasets from in situ measurements worldwide and from satellites provide opportunities in data driven methods for large scale studies or operational water management the results from the random forest model does not explicitly elaborate on process controlling soil moisture state and may suffer from poor extrapolation results it does however provide the important variables influencing the prediction accuracy which already hints at factors controlling soil moisture variability credit authorship contribution statement coleen carranza
