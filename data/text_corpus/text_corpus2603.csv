13015,in the present study different chemical species such as hydrogen peroxide potassium persulfate titanium dioxide and iron salts were employed for the treatment of a real poultry slaughterhouse wastewater poultry sww under uv c light 254 nm the experiments lasted 150 min and were carried out in a batch photoreactor aiming at investigating the most efficient operating conditions in terms of total organic carbon toc removal uv photolysis or fe doped tio2 photocatalysis were practically inefficient while application of un doped tio2 resulted in 44 toc removal after 60 min of uv irradiation the use of 98 mm h2o2 under uv light led to 74 toc removal after 150 min the addition of fe ii ions to this system coupled with initial ph adjustment to 3 increased the toc removal to 82 5 after 150 min finally the combination of uv with 15 mm of k2s2o8 resulted in 85 toc removal this was the first time when the persulfate oxidation was successfully applied for sww treatment to assess the energy efficiency of the various photochemical treatment processes tested estimation of the electric energy per order e eo kwh m3 order was conducted the lowest e eo value of 226 kwh m3 order was observed for the uv k2s2o8 process and compared with other photochemical treatment technologies the effluent quality of uv k2s2o8 treatment complies with the discharge water quality standards of the developed countries therefore it is possible to use uv k2s2o8 process as a post treatment after biological treatment of sww to meet the discharge water standards and reuse the wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords slaughterhouse wastewater photo fenton photo fenton like persulfate oxidation heterogeneous photocatalysis 1 introduction in 2018 global meat production was estimated at 336 million tons of which poultry accounted for 124 million tons making the poultry slaughter industry a significant part of the meat industry 1 consumption of poultry products in kazakhstan has steadily increased since 1992 reaching 17 88 kg per capita in 2017 however the poultry industry meets only 49 4 of demand in the domestic market due to population growth and increasing demand for poultry meat the kazakh government is intensifying poultry meat production throughout the country 2 in general wastewater in poultry farms is generated during the processes of industrial slaughter bleeding and scalding evisceration storage packaging washing and cleaning of equipment and facilities and production of by products 3 since the water used during the poultry production is in the range of 6 m3 to 30 m3 per ton of product 4 the global water consumption of the poultry slaughterhouses for 2018 can be estimated to be between 2 and 10 billion m3 a typical wastewater discharged from a poultry plant is characterized by high concentrations of various pollutants it contains high loads of total suspended solids tss oil and grease it is rich in total carbon tc total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and is characterized by large amounts of chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod total organic carbon toc comes from blood residues skin fats and oils while the major sources of organic nitrogen originate from residual blood urine and feces the disinfecting agents detergents blood and manure contribute to the presence of tp in this wastewater 5 in addition to organic contaminants poultry slaughterhouse wastewater poultry sww may contain various pathogenic microorganisms such as clostridium staphylococcus and salmonella 3 due to the strengthening of regulations on water disposal and rising environmental awareness among consumers the treatment of industrial wastewater has become an essential issue for the poultry processing industry most poultry sww treatment plants use biological treatment utilizing an activated sludge process 6 anaerobic static granular bed reactor 7 anaerobic membrane bioreactor 8 or stabilization pond 9 more than 80 of cod removal rate can be achieved biological methods are successfully used worldwide for wastewater treatment they are particularly effective and inexpensive when high loads of organic pollutants are involved 10 for example the energy consumption of wastewater treatment plants in greece ranged in 0 128 2 280 kwh m3 with an almost logarithmic negative correlation between incoming flow rate and energy consumption 11 in general approximately 50 60 of the energy is consumed for aeration 15 25 of the energy is used for activated sludge treatment while the secondary clarifying unit with recirculation requires up to 15 of the energy 12 however recalcitrant compounds present in sww such as antibiotics vaccines detergents and disinfectants can inhibit the activity of microorganisms and escape the activated sludge process and may have adverse effects on aquatic life 13 15 the possible inhibition associated with biological treatment and the tightening of discharge regulations motivate the exploration of complimentary techniques for wastewater treatment such as advanced oxidation processes aops aops are commonly based on the chemical reaction with hydroxyl or sulfate radicals in the presence of uv light and a catalyst these radicals are non selective have very high oxidation potential and rapid reaction rates resulting in shorter residence times and mineralization of organics moreover aops can be used for disinfection purposes 16 17 currently aops are considered as an attractive alternative or additional treatment option to conventional biological treatment of sww and have been investigated by a number of research groups 3 18 21 eryuruk et al investigated hybrid processes for the treatment of real poultry sww utilizing electrocoagulation with the addition of h2o2 3 they evaluated the effects of current density initial ph h2o2 concentration and polyelectrolyte dosage on organic matter removal in the case of peroxy electrocoagulation the optimal removal efficiency was obtained at a current density of 50 ma cm2 and the presence of 0 2 m h2o2 and 0 5 g l polyelectrolyte na2so4 according to the results the initial cod decreased from 8800 mg l to 425 mg l resulting in a 95 48 removal another study was conducted by davarnejad and nasiri related to the treatment of poultry sww with the electro fenton process cod removal of 92 37 and color removal of 88 06 were achieved by optimization of the system by response surface methodology rsm 18 thirugnanasambandham et al also used the rsm for the electro fenton process optimization to treat poultry wastewater 21 they found optimum treatment conditions at ph 3 current density of 10 ma cm2 20 ml l h2o2 and electrolysis time of 30 min which resulted in a turbidity and cod removal of 93 and 97 respectively a similar study on optimization of continuous flow uv h2o2 treatment of sww was conducted by bustillo lecompte et al 22 under optimal conditions determined using the central composite design ccd 81 of toc removal was obtained the treatment of real poultry sww using platinum decorated bivo4 g c3n4 photocatalyst under solar light irradiation was investigated by samsudin et al 20 the wet impregnation technique was used to incorporate platinum nanoparticles into pt bivo4 g c3n4 photocatalyst the impact of the ph and amount of loaded platinum on the photocatalytic degradation process was also studied after 3 h of solar light irradiation of sww the highest cod removal of 93 5 was achieved at ph 8 with the photocatalyst containing 1 5 wt pt in this work photochemical treatment of real slaughterhouse wastewater was carried out by photolysis photo fenton fe2 h2o2 uv and photo fenton like fe2 s2o8 2 uv processes using hydrogen peroxide and potassium persulfate as oxidants tio2 and fe 4 tio2 catalysts were used for the photocatalytic degradation in addition the effect of initial ph and different concentrations of h2o2 on the wastewater treatment process was evaluated although many studies deal with biological chemical and physical treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater only a very limited number of them are relevant to photochemical treatment of real slaughterhouse wastewater as far as the authors are aware there are no published studies dealing with the application of sulfate radicals for the photochemical treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals hydrogen peroxide solution 37 6 w w skat reactiv was used as a source of hydroxyl radicals ph was adjusted using hydrochloric acid acs reagent 37 w w received from sigma aldrich ammonium iron ii sulfate hexahydrate acs reagent 99 w w and iron iii chloride anhydrous laboratory reagent grade 98 w w were supplied by fisher chemical titanium dioxide p 25 nanopowder 99 5 primary particle size 21 nm used as a photocatalyst and potassium persulfate 99 used as a source of sulfate radicals were purchased from sigma aldrich all chemicals were used without further purification 4 fe tio2 was synthesized earlier 23 using the wet impregnation method 2 2 poultry slaughterhouse wastewater source and characteristics the wastewater used was collected from the local slaughterhouse of the poultry farm pc izhevsk izhevsk village arshaly district aqmola region kazakhstan which produces 20 tons of meat per day the wastewater was sterilized for proper preservation and inactivation pathogenic microorganisms steam sterilization was carried out in a vk 75 autoclave under the following conditions t 121 c 1 1 atm 45 min samples were preserved by storing them in a fridge at 4 c the concentration of total carbon tc total inorganic carbon tic and total nitrogen tn as well as ph of the sterile poultry wastewater used in all experiments are shown in table 1 2 3 experimental procedure all experiments were performed in a toption instrument co ltd photochemical batch reactor 24 the reactor was equipped with a 400 ml vessel and a 254 nm uv lamp with 30 w power the solution in the reactor vessel was continuously mixed using a magnetic stirrer the thermo scientific accel 500 lt cooling heating chiller was connected to the reactor vessel to maintain the temperature at 20 c most of the experiments were performed without ph adjustment before starting the reaction the wastewater is filled into the reactor vessel then a certain amount of the reactant is added the start of the experiment is considered to be the time when the uv lamp is switched on in the experiments with ph adjustment the ph of the solution was changed with 1 m hydrochloric acid before adding the reactant each experiment lasted 150 min and samples were taken from the reaction mixture every 30 min and sent for analysis 2 4 analytical methods and calculations multi n c 3100 analytik jena ag germany was used for tc tic toc tn analyses the details of the tc tic toc tn measurement have been presented in the previous work 14 wtw inolab multi 9310 ids was used for ph measurements the cod concentration was measured using the hach drb 200 dry thermostat reactor and hach dr 3900 spectrophotometer thermo scientific dionex ics 6000 ion chromatography ic was applied for quantitative analysis of anions and cations in the wastewater while metrohm 930 compact ic flex was utilized to measure the concentrations of formic acid and acetic acid in final solutions additionally the poultry wastewater was characterized using x ray fluorescence spectrometry the axiosmax xrf spectrometer supplied by malvern panalytical agilent cary 600 series was used for ftir evaluation to identify functional groups in the wastewater the removal rates of tc tic toc were quantified by eq 1 1 removal efficiency c 0 c t c 0 100 where c 0 is the initial concentration and c t is the concentration after time t the consumption of electricity because of the lamp operation contributes considerably to the overall cost of aops based on uv light in the case of a batch system the electric energy per order e eo kwh m3 order can be estimated as in eq 2 23 2 e eo p t 1000 v 60 log c o c f where p is the electrical power of the lamp kw t is the illumination time min v is the wastewater volume l c o and c f are the initial and final concentration of the pollutant as toc in mg l the experimental error was determined to be below 5 during triplicate preliminary experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater table 1 shows that cod and toc of poultry sww were respective 155 15 mg l and 68 66 9 7 mg l which refer to low strength wastewater according to the european and world bank standards cod should not exceed 125 mg l in the discharge of slaughterhouse effluent while the discharge limits of bod for the usa and canada are 16 26 mg l and 5 30 mg l respectively in the case of australian standards the limits for cod and toc are 40 mg l and 10 mg l respectively 25 generally anaerobic treatment is used to treat high strength sww however it often struggles to comply with the standard discharge limits 26 moreover the recalcitrant compounds such as detergents antibiotics and disinfectants may escape the biological process 13 therefore there is a need for post treatment to achieve complete removal of pollutants a similar work has been conducted by vidal et al 27 where high strength sww was first treated with anaerobic digestion and effluents with cod and toc of 137 mg l and 52 mg l respectively were produced then the effluents were treated using solar photoelectro fenton process and the authors were able to reduce cod and toc to 10 mg l and 2 mg l respectively the results of the ion chromatography ic and xrf analyses are summarized in tables 2 and 3 according to the ic and xrf results poultry sww contains high amounts of na k mg2 ca2 f cl and so4 2 and trace amounts of nh4 br no3 po4 3 and sr cl and br are known to scavenge sulfate and hydroxyl radicals 28 moreover the presence of these halide ions may lead to formation of toxic oxyanions such as clo3 and bro3 28 total inorganic carbon is constituted from bicarbonate and carbonate ions and both can scavenge hydroxyl and sulfate radicals 29 sr is alkaline earth metal and is frequently found in groundwater and wastewaters worldwide 30 the ft ir spectra of the poultry sww are shown in fig s1 according to the ft ir results table s 1 the wastewater contained compounds with the following functional groups oh stretching and c h stretching 3343 cm 1 cn 2337 cm 1 cc stretching co stretching oh bending and nh bending 1636 cm 1 cbr and ci 497 cm 1 31 35 the presence of bromine species were confirmed by both ic and ft ir analyses which can be originated from bromine containing sanitizers commonly used to reduce pathogenic microorganisms in facilities and equipment 36 3 2 uv h2o2 process initially the poultry sww was treated using 49 196 mm 1670 6678 mg l of h2o2 under uv light irradiation one experiment was also conducted using only uv light without h2o2 the results obtained are shown in fig 1 uv light 254 nm without any oxidant did not lead to deep mineralization of the wastewater toc removal 3 as h2o almost does not absorb energy at this wavelength water splitting starts to occur only under the vacuum uv 200 nm eq 3 which means that hydroxyl radicals generated by the dissociation of hydrogen peroxide were responsible for the oxidation of carbon in the wastewater eq 4 37 3 h 2 o hv vacuum uv oh h 4 h 2 o 2 hv 2 oh increasing the initial concentration of h2o2 from 49 to 98 mm resulted in an increase of toc removal from 47 to 74 since more hydroxyl radicals were available for the mineralization of organic species however a further increase in h2o2 was not beneficial due to the scavenging effect of h2o2 itself on the produced hydroxyl radicals which has been previously observed in similar works 38 40 the ph evolution is shown in fig s3 from an initial value in the range of 7 5 7 7 ph dropped to 6 7 6 8 with the exception of the experiment in the absence of h2o2 where ph remained practically the same the effective performance of aops at neutral or near neutral ph is of great importance due to potential practical applications in this field 41 for example the following work has been carried out on the electrochemical oxidation of sww at neutral and near neutral ph 13 42 whereas ph adjustment would require the implementation of an additional neutralization step prior to the discharge of the treated water the mineralization took place through a radical reaction mechanism presented in more detail elsewhere 22 the final toc removal values obtained in this study are comparable with those reported previously bustillo lecompte et al reported an optimum ratio between influent toc and h2o2 equal to 35 8 mg l toc mg l h2o2 for achieving maximum toc removal 81 22 these values are comparable with the ones obtained in our study using a batch photoreactor namely 48 6 and 74 respectively the results of the energy per order calculations are shown in fig 2 it is obvious that the concentration of 98 mm h2o2 led to the lowest e eo value 324 kwh m3 order among the uv h2o2 processes subsequently the initial ph of the wastewater was regulated at lower values in order to explore the possibility of achieving the same final toc removal 74 using lower amounts of h2o2 decreasing thus the cost of the process the influence of ph is significant when hydrogen peroxide is used as an oxidant as it affects the generation of hydroxyl radicals acidic values are considered beneficial to the process because h2o2 being a weak acid is stable under acidic conditions and can generate oxidative ho2 agents eq 5 43 5 h 2 o 2 ho 2 h however it is clear from fig 3 that decreasing the initial ph of the wastewater was not beneficial for the process h3o2 is formed in the presence of h2o2 in highly acidic aqueous environments eq 6 which increases the stability of h2o2 and causes a decrease in oh radicals by limiting the generation of oh radicals 44 moreover ho2 also competes for h2o2 and oh radicals eqs 7 8 43 6 h 2 o 2 h h 3 o 2 7 h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o o 2 oh 8 oh ho 2 oh ho 2 the results obtained are in accordance with the work by xin et al 45 the overall influence of ph depends also on which form of the target molecule prevails in the solution as a function of pka the cationic the neutral or the anionic form 46 therefore the concentration of 98 mm h2o2 was used for photo fenton experiments 3 3 uv h2o2 fe ii process the uv h2o2 process is by far the most studied aop where the generation of hydroxyl radicals is mediated by the photolysis of hydrogen peroxide 47 the process however is limited by the low uv photon absorption of h2o2 as its molar absorption coefficient at 254 nm is only 19 0 m 1 cm 1 48 the addition of iron can enhance the photon absorption and the use of hydrogen peroxide by starting photo fenton reactions improving thus the whole process 49 when fe iii is initially used instead of fe ii the process is called photo fenton like in this batch of experiments the initial concentration of h2o2 was 98 mm and 5 or 20 mg l of fe ii were used the initial ph was adjusted to 3 30 in one case for 20 mg l of fe fig 4 increasing the iron concentration from 5 to 20 mg l was beneficial for the process only during the first hour of the treatment as gradually the final toc removal converged to the value of 67 in both cases the initial adjustment of the ph to 3 3 considerably increased the final toc removal achieved 82 5 it has been previously reported that fenton reactions are favored by a ph value close to 3 50 at ph values in the range of 2 8 3 5 the fe oh 2 is formed which has a crucial impact on the efficiency of the photo fenton process the values of e eo for the photo fenton experiments were calculated as 383 kwh m3 order and 248 kwh m3 order without and with initial ph adjustment respectively 3 4 uv tio2 process tio2 mediated photocatalysis was also used for the treatment of the poultry sww specifically two catalysts were used under uv light a titanium dioxide p 25 at 0 5 and 1 0 g l and b titanium dioxide p 25 doped with iron 4 wt at 0 5 g l previously the fe tio2 had shown improved performance in the mineralization of 4 tert butylphenol in water compared to the base tio2 catalyst 23 the results obtained are shown in fig 5 it appears from the results obtained that the toc removal efficiency of the undoped catalyst was higher than that of the fe doped catalyst the use of 0 5 g l and 1 g l tio2 resulted in toc removals of 44 and 40 after 60 min respectively while the measurement of toc values after 150 min did not show any significant difference the increase in catalyst concentration resulted in an increase in the turbidity of the solution which in turn reduced the penetration of the light and the catalyst activity 51 the toc removal achieved by the application of fe doped tio2 was too low to be of practical significance 10 after 150 min according to the literature fe doping differently affects the wastewater treatment efficiency specifically makhatova et al used fe doped tio2 catalysts 0 5 1 2 and 4 wt and only 4 fe tio2 showed improved toc removal efficiency than tio2 23 reddy et al synthesized fe doped tio2 for the sonophotocatalytic treatment of a real textile wastewater with doping ratios of 7 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 and 1 7 fe tio2 toc removal of 91 was achieved in the case of fe tio2 1 7 which was higher than those in the cases of undoped tio2 and other fe doped catalysts 52 chen et al also prepared different fe dopant amounts 0 01 0 03 0 05 0 07 and 0 10 53 the cod removal rate of samples with the lower content of fe 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 was higher than that of the undoped tio2 in the photocatalytic treatment of papermaking wastewater the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity can be explained by the improved separating efficiency of electron hole by the introduction of fe ions 53 however excessive amounts of fe deposited on the surface of tio2 affects adversely the catalytic efficiency by creating a new layer of iron oxides which has a lower energy bandgap than tio2 53 bukhari et al studied the photocatalytic treatment of sww using pure tio2 1 g l and achieved 72 removal of cod whereas doping with ag slightly increased the cod removal up to 75 54 the value of e eo for the heterogeneous photocatalysis experiments was calculated as 742 and 758 kwh m3 order for 0 5 g l and 1 0 g l tio2 respectively 3 5 uv k2s2o8 the k2s2o8 driven photocatalytic process was applied for the poultry sww treatment k2s2o8 is a source of the highly oxidative sulfate radicals so4 with a redox potential e0 of 2 5 3 1 ev and is used as an alternative to hydroxyl radicals oh e0 2 8 ev in aops so4 is formed by the photochemical decomposition of s2o8 2 and is able to efficiently degrade many organic contaminants unlike oh it is less challenged by the presence of natural organic matter and alkaline compounds in the solution 55 the concentrations of k2s2o8 used were 1 3 10 and 15 mm moreover a photo fenton like process was utilized combining 15 mm of k2s2o8 and 20 mg l of fe ii under uv light fig 6 the toc removal was increased by the increase in the concentration of the oxidant the application of 15 mm of k2s2o8 resulted in 85 removal of toc after 150 min and was more effective than when 98 mm of h2o2 74 toc removal was used in previous experiments the use of the photo fenton like process 15 mm of k2s2o8 20 mg l of fe ii led to 73 5 of toc removal while 67 removal of toc was obtained employing the photo fenton process 98 mm of h2o2 20 mg l of fe ii hydroxyl radicals oh have a shorter half life 10 3 μs than sulfate radicals so4 30 40 μs consequently so4 is less sensitive to scavenging by non targeted molecules which makes so4 more attractive to oh when dealing with real wastewaters 56 the comparison of oh and so4 driven photocatalytic systems has been studied previously velo gala et al conducted photochemical treatment of sodium diatrizoate dtz using 10 mm of k2s2o8 and 10 mm of h2o2 and obtained 78 3 and 77 1 degradation of dtz at ph 6 5 respectively 57 it was noted that unlike the uv k2s2o8 system the degradation performance of the uv h2o2 system has been adversely affected by the increase in ph acosta rangel et al compared the uv h2o2 and uv k2s2o8 assisted degradation of sulfamethazine smz 80 and 89 degradation of smz was reported with the use of 0 147 mm of k2s2o8 and 0 147 mm of h2o2 after 60 min of the experiment 58 to compare the toc and cod removal efficiencies of the different aops applied for sww treatment recent works have been reviewed and plotted in fig 7 as can be seen from fig 7 most of the works successfully treated sww and the pollutant removal ranged from 81 to 99 the removal efficiencies of the uv h2o2 fe2 ph 3 and uv k2s2o8 processes used in the present work were within the indicated range further details on wastewater parameters and experimental conditions for these processes can be found in table s2 the value of e eo for the uv k2s2o8 was calculated as 226 and 325 kwh m3 order for 15 mm of k2s2o8 and 15 mm of k2s2o8 with 20 mg l fe ii respectively the reported e eo values for persulfate driven aops are shown in table s3 obviously most of the works were done with model solutions 10 12 62 67 therefore the e eo values of these processes were low ranging from 0 0290 to 16 76 kwh m3 order except for the work of gao et al 10 where e eo was unusually high for model solutions 415 58 kwh m3 order in contrast the works with real wastewater show higher energy consumption as in the present work 24 29 similarly ozturk and yilmaz performed electrochemical treatment of sww and the lowest electrical energy consumption achieved was 153 57 kwh m3 13 which is comparable to the current work nowadays uv persulfate process is considered as close to full scale application in wastewater treatment 68 however it should be taken into account that the e eo values are indicative and pilot scale testing is needed to determine its feasibility at a larger scale 69 3 6 formation of intermediates formic acid and acetic acid were determined using ion chromatography these compounds are the last intermediates that can be detected before the complete mineralization of the organic compounds to calculate the organic carbon oc of the remaining intermediates the final concentrations of toc formic acid and acetic acid were quantified the concentrations of the oc in the forms of the organic intermediates and mineralized co2 were indirectly calculated by the following material balances 9 oc intermediates final toc overall toc formic acid toc acetic acid 10 oc co 2 initial toc overall finaltoc overall the results are shown in fig s4 the increase in the concentration of h2o2 increased the formation of acids while the lowest concentration of intermediates other than acids was observed at 98 mm of h2o2 at the uv h2o2 process the adjustment of ph from neutral to acidic values also led to the increase in the formation of acids similarly the increment in fe ii concentration from 5 mg l to 20 mg l at the uv h2o2 fe ii process slightly decreased the concentration of intermediates moreover the coupling of this process with acidic ph elevated the co2 generation the least amount of unidentified intermediates 10 of toc was observed at the uv h2o2 fe ii process at ph 3 3 where 1 2 mg l of formic acid and 17 9 mg l of acetic acid were detected formic acid and acetic acid have not been found in the final solutions after experiments with the heterogeneous catalysts as it can be seen from fig s4 the increase in k2s2o8 concentration enhanced the mineralization of the intermediates through the formation of co2 finally the addition of fe ii did not improve the efficiency of the uv k2s2o8 contrary to the uv h2o2 fe ii process 4 conclusions in this work different photochemical treatment processes were used for the treatment of a real poultry sww the main objective was to find the most effective photochemical system for treating real wastewater with complex matrix considering the total organic carbon removal achieved the use of uv light alone and the use of the uv 4 fe tio2 process had negligible toc removal efficiencies while the use of undoped tio2 0 5 g l removed 44 of the toc after 60 min increasing the h2o2 concentration up to 98 mm was beneficial and resulted in 74 toc removal by the uv h2o2 method the use of higher iron concentrations was not beneficial to the efficiency of the process an initial ph adjustment to 3 3 did not significantly affect the toc removal in the uv h2o2 process but considerably increased the toc removal during the photo fenton treatment with 98 mm h2o2 and 20 mg l fe ii resulting in a toc removal of 82 5 after 150 min 1 2 mg l of formic acid and 17 9 mg l of acetic acid were detected using ic in the effluents after uv h2o2 fe ii process at ph 3 3 where only 10 of toc was not identified for the uv k2s2o8 system the use of 15 mm k2s2o8 resulted in 85 toc removal after 150 min while 73 5 toc removal was achieved when the photo fenton like process 15 mm k2s2o8 20 mg l fe ii was applied the uv k2s2o8 treatment had the lowest e eo value of 226 kwh m3 order the effluent quality of uv k2s2o8 treatment was below the discharge limits of the current legislation of the usa canada australia and european countries in order to meet the wastewater disposal regulations and reuse the treated water the uv k2s2o8 process can be used as a post treatment after biological treatment of wastewater future works will be devoted to the screening of different catalytic materials for efficient persulfate activation declaration of competing interest the

13015,in the present study different chemical species such as hydrogen peroxide potassium persulfate titanium dioxide and iron salts were employed for the treatment of a real poultry slaughterhouse wastewater poultry sww under uv c light 254 nm the experiments lasted 150 min and were carried out in a batch photoreactor aiming at investigating the most efficient operating conditions in terms of total organic carbon toc removal uv photolysis or fe doped tio2 photocatalysis were practically inefficient while application of un doped tio2 resulted in 44 toc removal after 60 min of uv irradiation the use of 98 mm h2o2 under uv light led to 74 toc removal after 150 min the addition of fe ii ions to this system coupled with initial ph adjustment to 3 increased the toc removal to 82 5 after 150 min finally the combination of uv with 15 mm of k2s2o8 resulted in 85 toc removal this was the first time when the persulfate oxidation was successfully applied for sww treatment to assess the energy efficiency of the various photochemical treatment processes tested estimation of the electric energy per order e eo kwh m3 order was conducted the lowest e eo value of 226 kwh m3 order was observed for the uv k2s2o8 process and compared with other photochemical treatment technologies the effluent quality of uv k2s2o8 treatment complies with the discharge water quality standards of the developed countries therefore it is possible to use uv k2s2o8 process as a post treatment after biological treatment of sww to meet the discharge water standards and reuse the wastewater graphical abstract

million tons of which poultry accounted for 124 million tons making the poultry slaughter industry a significant part of the meat industry 1 consumption of poultry products in kazakhstan has steadily increased since 1992 reaching 17 88 kg per capita in 2017 however the poultry industry meets only 49 4 of demand in the domestic market due to population growth and increasing demand for poultry meat

to 15 of the energy 12 however recalcitrant compounds present in sww such as antibiotics vaccines detergents and disinfectants can inhibit the activity of microorganisms and escape the activated sludge process and may have adverse effects on aquatic life 13 15 the possible inhibition associated with biological treatment and the tightening of discharge regulations motivate the exploration of complimentary techniques for wastewater treatment such as advanced oxidation processes aops aops are commonly based on the chemical reaction with hydroxyl or sulfate radicals in the presence of uv light and a catalyst these radicals are non selective have very high oxidation potential and rapid reaction rates resulting in shorter residence times and mineralization of organics moreover aops can be used for disinfection purposes 16 17 currently aops are considered as an attractive alternative or additional treatment option to conventional biological treatment of sww and have been investigated by a number of research groups 3 18 21 eryuruk et al investigated hybrid processes for the treatment of real poultry sww utilizing electrocoagulation with the addition of h2o2 3 they evaluated the effects of current density initial ph h2o2 concentration and polyelectrolyte dosage on organic matter removal in the case of peroxy electrocoagulation the optimal removal efficiency was obtained at a current density of 50 ma cm2 and the presence of 0 2 m h2o2 and 0 5 g l polyelectrolyte na2so4 according to the results the initial cod decreased from 8800 mg l to 425 mg l resulting in a 95 48 removal another study was conducted by davarnejad and nasiri related to the treatment of poultry sww with the electro fenton process cod removal of 92 37 and color removal of 88 06 were achieved by optimization of the system by response surface methodology rsm 18 thirugnanasambandham et al also used the rsm for the electro fenton process optimization to treat poultry wastewater 21 they found optimum treatment conditions at ph 3 current density of 10 ma cm2 20 ml l h2o2 and electrolysis time of 30 min which resulted in a turbidity and cod removal of 93 and 97 respectively a similar study on optimization of continuous flow uv h2o2 treatment of sww was conducted by bustillo lecompte et al 22 under optimal conditions determined using the central composite design ccd 81 of toc removal was obtained the treatment of real poultry sww using platinum decorated bivo4 g c3n4 photocatalyst under solar light irradiation was investigated by samsudin et al 20 the wet impregnation technique was used to incorporate platinum nanoparticles into pt bivo4 g c3n4 photocatalyst the impact of the ph and amount of loaded platinum on the photocatalytic degradation process was also studied after 3 h of solar light irradiation of sww the highest cod removal of 93 5 was achieved at ph 8 with the photocatalyst containing 1 5 wt pt in this work photochemical treatment of real slaughterhouse wastewater was carried out by photolysis photo fenton fe2 h2o2 uv and photo fenton like fe2 s2o8 2 uv processes using hydrogen peroxide and potassium persulfate as oxidants tio2 and fe 4 tio2 catalysts were used for the photocatalytic degradation in addition the effect of initial ph and different concentrations of h2o2 on the wastewater treatment process was evaluated although many studies deal with biological chemical and physical treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater only a very limited number of them are relevant to photochemical treatment of real slaughterhouse wastewater as far as the authors are aware there are no published studies dealing with the application of sulfate radicals for the photochemical treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals hydrogen peroxide solution 37 6 w w skat reactiv was used as a source of hydroxyl radicals ph was adjusted using hydrochloric acid acs reagent 37 w w received from sigma aldrich ammonium iron ii sulfate hexahydrate acs reagent 99 w w and iron iii chloride anhydrous laboratory reagent grade 98 w w were supplied by fisher chemical titanium dioxide p 25 nanopowder 99 5 primary particle size 21 nm used as a photocatalyst and potassium persulfate 99 used as a source of sulfate radicals were purchased from sigma aldrich all chemicals were used without further purification 4 fe tio2 was synthesized earlier 23 using the wet impregnation method 2 2 poultry slaughterhouse wastewater source and characteristics the wastewater used was collected from the local slaughterhouse of the poultry farm pc izhevsk izhevsk village arshaly district aqmola region kazakhstan which produces 20 tons of meat per day the wastewater was sterilized for proper preservation and inactivation pathogenic microorganisms steam sterilization was carried out in a vk 75 autoclave under the following conditions t 121 c 1 1 atm 45 min samples were preserved by storing them in a fridge at 4 c the concentration of total carbon tc total inorganic carbon tic and total nitrogen tn as well as ph of the sterile poultry wastewater used in all experiments are shown in table 1 2 3 experimental procedure all experiments were performed in a toption instrument co ltd photochemical batch reactor 24 the reactor was equipped with a 400 ml vessel and a 254 nm uv lamp with 30 w power the solution in the reactor vessel was continuously mixed using a magnetic stirrer the thermo scientific accel 500 lt cooling heating chiller was connected to the reactor vessel to maintain the temperature at 20 c most of the experiments were performed without ph adjustment before starting the reaction the wastewater is filled into the reactor vessel then a certain amount of the reactant is added the start of the experiment is considered to be the time when the uv lamp is switched on in the experiments with ph adjustment the ph of the solution was changed with 1 m hydrochloric acid before adding the reactant each experiment lasted 150 min and samples were taken from the reaction mixture every 30 min and sent for analysis 2 4 analytical methods and calculations multi n c 3100 analytik jena ag germany was used for tc tic toc tn analyses the details of the tc tic toc tn measurement have been presented in the previous work 14 wtw inolab multi 9310 ids was used for ph measurements the cod concentration was measured using the hach drb 200 dry thermostat reactor and hach dr 3900 spectrophotometer thermo scientific dionex ics 6000 ion chromatography ic was applied for quantitative analysis of anions and cations in the wastewater while metrohm 930 compact ic flex was utilized to measure the concentrations of formic acid and acetic acid in final solutions additionally the poultry wastewater was characterized using x ray fluorescence spectrometry the axiosmax xrf spectrometer supplied by malvern panalytical agilent cary 600 series was used for ftir evaluation to identify functional groups in the wastewater the removal rates of tc tic toc were quantified by eq 1 1 removal efficiency c 0 c t c 0 100 where c 0 is the initial concentration and c t is the concentration after time t the consumption of electricity because of the lamp operation contributes considerably to the overall cost of aops based on uv light in the case of a batch system the electric energy per order e eo kwh m3 order can be estimated as in eq 2 23 2 e eo p t 1000 v 60 log c o c f where p is the electrical power of the lamp kw t is the illumination time min v is the wastewater volume l c o and c f are the initial and final concentration of the pollutant as toc in mg l the experimental error was determined to be below 5 during triplicate preliminary experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater table 1 shows that cod and toc of poultry sww were respective 155 15 mg l and 68 66 9 7 mg l which refer to low strength wastewater according to the european and world bank standards cod should not exceed 125 mg l in the discharge of slaughterhouse effluent while the discharge limits of bod for the usa and canada are 16 26 mg l and 5 30 mg l respectively in the case of australian standards the limits for cod and toc are 40 mg l and 10 mg l respectively 25 generally anaerobic treatment is used to treat high strength sww however it often struggles to comply with the standard discharge limits 26 moreover the recalcitrant compounds such as detergents antibiotics and disinfectants may escape the biological process 13 therefore there is a need for post treatment to achieve complete removal of pollutants a similar work has been conducted by vidal et al 27 where high strength sww was first treated with anaerobic digestion and effluents with cod and toc of 137 mg l and 52 mg l respectively were produced then the effluents were treated using solar photoelectro fenton process and the authors were able to reduce cod and toc to 10 mg l and 2 mg l respectively the results of the ion chromatography ic and xrf analyses are summarized in tables 2 and 3 according to the ic and xrf results poultry sww contains high amounts of na k mg2 ca2 f cl and so4 2 and trace amounts of nh4 br no3 po4 3 and sr cl and br are known to scavenge sulfate and hydroxyl radicals 28 moreover the presence of these halide ions may lead to formation of toxic oxyanions such as clo3 and bro3 28 total inorganic carbon is constituted from bicarbonate and carbonate ions and both can scavenge hydroxyl and sulfate radicals 29 sr is alkaline earth metal and is frequently found in groundwater and wastewaters worldwide 30 the ft ir spectra of the poultry sww are shown in fig s1 according to the ft ir results table s 1 the wastewater contained compounds with the following functional groups oh stretching and c h stretching 3343 cm 1 cn 2337 cm 1 cc stretching co stretching oh bending and nh bending 1636 cm 1 cbr and ci 497 cm 1 31 35 the presence of bromine species were confirmed by both ic and ft ir analyses which can be originated from bromine containing sanitizers commonly used to reduce pathogenic microorganisms in facilities and equipment 36 3 2 uv h2o2 process initially the poultry sww was treated using 49 196 mm 1670 6678 mg l of h2o2 under uv light irradiation one experiment was also conducted using only uv light without h2o2 the results obtained are shown in fig 1 uv light 254 nm without any oxidant did not lead to deep mineralization of the wastewater toc removal 3 as h2o almost does not absorb energy at this wavelength water splitting starts to occur only under the vacuum uv 200 nm eq 3 which means that hydroxyl radicals generated by the dissociation of hydrogen peroxide were responsible for the oxidation of carbon in the wastewater eq 4 37 3 h 2 o hv vacuum uv oh h 4 h 2 o 2 hv 2 oh increasing the initial concentration of h2o2 from 49 to 98 mm resulted in an increase of toc removal from 47 to 74 since more hydroxyl radicals were available for the mineralization of organic species however a further increase in h2o2 was not beneficial due to the scavenging effect of h2o2 itself on the produced hydroxyl radicals which has been previously observed in similar works 38 40 the ph evolution is shown in fig s3 from an initial value in the range of 7 5 7 7 ph dropped to 6 7 6 8 with the exception of the experiment in the absence of h2o2 where ph remained practically the same the effective performance of aops at neutral or near neutral ph is of great importance due to potential practical applications in this field 41 for example the following work has been carried out on the electrochemical oxidation of sww at neutral and near neutral ph 13 42 whereas ph adjustment would require the implementation of an additional neutralization step prior to the discharge of the treated water the mineralization took place through a radical reaction mechanism presented in more detail elsewhere 22 the final toc removal values obtained in this study are comparable with those reported previously bustillo lecompte et al reported an optimum ratio between influent toc and h2o2 equal to 35 8 mg l toc mg l h2o2 for achieving maximum toc removal 81 22 these values are comparable with the ones obtained in our study using a batch photoreactor namely 48 6 and 74 respectively the results of the energy per order calculations are shown in fig 2 it is obvious that the concentration of 98 mm h2o2 led to the lowest e eo value 324 kwh m3 order among the uv h2o2 processes subsequently the initial ph of the wastewater was regulated at lower values in order to explore the possibility of achieving the same final toc removal 74 using lower amounts of h2o2 decreasing thus the cost of the process the influence of ph is significant when hydrogen peroxide is used as an oxidant as it affects the generation of hydroxyl radicals acidic values are considered beneficial to the process because h2o2 being a weak acid is stable under acidic conditions and can generate oxidative ho2 agents eq 5 43 5 h 2 o 2 ho 2 h however it is clear from fig 3 that decreasing the initial ph of the wastewater was not beneficial for the process h3o2 is formed in the presence of h2o2 in highly acidic aqueous environments eq 6 which increases the stability of h2o2 and causes a decrease in oh radicals by limiting the generation of oh radicals 44 moreover ho2 also competes for h2o2 and oh radicals eqs 7 8 43 6 h 2 o 2 h h 3 o 2 7 h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o o 2 oh 8 oh ho 2 oh ho 2 the results obtained are in accordance with the work by xin et al 45 the overall influence of ph depends also on which form of the target molecule prevails in the solution as a function of pka the cationic the neutral or the anionic form 46 therefore the concentration of 98 mm h2o2 was used for photo fenton experiments 3 3 uv h2o2 fe ii process the uv h2o2 process is by far the most studied aop where the generation of hydroxyl radicals is mediated by the photolysis of hydrogen peroxide 47 the process however is limited by the low uv photon absorption of h2o2 as its molar absorption coefficient at 254 nm is only 19 0 m 1 cm 1 48 the addition of iron can enhance the photon absorption and the use of hydrogen peroxide by starting photo fenton reactions improving thus the whole process 49 when fe iii is initially used instead of fe ii the process is called photo fenton like in this batch of experiments the initial concentration of h2o2 was 98 mm and 5 or 20 mg l of fe ii were used the initial ph was adjusted to 3 30 in one case for 20 mg l of fe fig 4 increasing the iron concentration from 5 to 20 mg l was beneficial for the process only during the first hour of the treatment as gradually the final toc removal converged to the value of 67 in both cases the initial adjustment of the ph to 3 3 considerably increased the final toc removal achieved 82 5 it has been previously reported that fenton reactions are favored by a ph value close to 3 50 at ph values in the range of 2 8 3 5 the fe oh 2 is formed which has a crucial impact on the efficiency of the photo fenton process the values of e eo for the photo fenton experiments were calculated as 383 kwh m3 order and 248 kwh m3 order without and with initial ph adjustment respectively 3 4 uv tio2 process tio2 mediated photocatalysis was also used for the treatment of the poultry sww specifically two catalysts were used under uv light a titanium dioxide p 25 at 0 5 and 1 0 g l and b titanium dioxide p 25 doped with iron 4 wt at 0 5 g l previously the fe tio2 had shown improved performance in the mineralization of 4 tert butylphenol in water compared to the base tio2 catalyst 23 the results obtained are shown in fig 5 it appears from the results obtained that the toc removal efficiency of the undoped catalyst was higher than that of the fe doped catalyst the use of 0 5 g l and 1 g l tio2 resulted in toc removals of 44 and 40 after 60 min respectively while the measurement of toc values after 150 min did not show any significant difference the increase in catalyst concentration resulted in an increase in the turbidity of the solution which in turn reduced the penetration of the light and the catalyst activity 51 the toc removal achieved by the application of fe doped tio2 was too low to be of practical significance 10 after 150 min according to the literature fe doping differently affects the wastewater treatment efficiency specifically makhatova et al used fe doped tio2 catalysts 0 5 1 2 and 4 wt and only 4 fe tio2 showed improved toc removal efficiency than tio2 23 reddy et al synthesized fe doped tio2 for the sonophotocatalytic treatment of a real textile wastewater with doping ratios of 7 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 and 1 7 fe tio2 toc removal of 91 was achieved in the case of fe tio2 1 7 which was higher than those in the cases of undoped tio2 and other fe doped catalysts 52 chen et al also prepared different fe dopant amounts 0 01 0 03 0 05 0 07 and 0 10 53 the cod removal rate of samples with the lower content of fe 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 was higher than that of the undoped tio2 in the photocatalytic treatment of papermaking wastewater the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity can be explained by the improved separating efficiency of electron hole by the introduction of fe ions 53 however excessive amounts of fe deposited on the surface of tio2 affects adversely the catalytic efficiency by creating a new layer of iron oxides which has a lower energy bandgap than tio2 53 bukhari et al studied the photocatalytic treatment of sww using pure tio2 1 g l and achieved 72 removal of cod whereas doping with ag slightly increased the cod removal up to 75 54 the value of e eo for the heterogeneous photocatalysis experiments was calculated as 742 and 758 kwh m3 order for 0 5 g l and 1 0 g l tio2 respectively 3 5 uv k2s2o8 the k2s2o8 driven photocatalytic process was applied for the poultry sww treatment k2s2o8 is a source of the highly oxidative sulfate radicals so4 with a redox potential e0 of 2 5 3 1 ev and is used as an alternative to hydroxyl radicals oh e0 2 8 ev in aops so4 is formed by the photochemical decomposition of s2o8 2 and is able to efficiently degrade many organic contaminants unlike oh it is less challenged by the presence of natural organic matter and alkaline compounds in the solution 55 the concentrations of k2s2o8 used were 1 3 10 and 15 mm moreover a photo fenton like process was utilized combining 15 mm of k2s2o8 and 20 mg l of fe ii under uv light fig 6 the toc removal was increased by the increase in the concentration of the oxidant the application of 15 mm of k2s2o8 resulted in 85 removal of toc after 150 min and was more effective than when 98 mm of h2o2 74 toc removal was used in previous experiments the use of the photo fenton like process 15 mm of k2s2o8 20 mg l of fe ii led to 73 5 of toc removal while 67 removal of toc was obtained employing the photo fenton process 98 mm of h2o2 20 mg l of fe ii hydroxyl radicals oh have a shorter half life 10 3 μs than sulfate radicals so4 30 40 μs consequently so4 is less sensitive to scavenging by non targeted molecules which makes so4 more attractive to oh when dealing with real wastewaters 56 the comparison of oh and so4 driven photocatalytic systems has been studied previously velo gala et al conducted photochemical treatment of sodium diatrizoate dtz using 10 mm of k2s2o8 and 10 mm of h2o2 and obtained 78 3 and 77 1 degradation of dtz at ph 6 5 respectively 57 it was noted that unlike the uv k2s2o8 system the degradation performance of the uv h2o2 system has been adversely affected by the increase in ph acosta rangel et al compared the uv h2o2 and uv k2s2o8 assisted degradation of sulfamethazine smz 80 and 89 degradation of smz was reported with the use of 0 147 mm of k2s2o8 and 0 147 mm of h2o2 after 60 min of the experiment 58 to compare the toc and cod removal efficiencies of the different aops applied for sww treatment recent works have been reviewed and plotted in fig 7 as can be seen from fig 7 most of the works successfully treated sww and the pollutant removal ranged from 81 to 99 the removal efficiencies of the uv h2o2 fe2 ph 3 and uv k2s2o8 processes used in the present work were within the indicated range further details on wastewater parameters and experimental conditions for these processes can be found in table s2 the value of e eo for the uv k2s2o8 was calculated as 226 and 325 kwh m3 order for 15 mm of k2s2o8 and 15 mm of k2s2o8 with 20 mg l fe ii respectively the reported e eo values for persulfate driven aops are shown in table s3 obviously most of the works were done with model solutions 10 12 62 67 therefore the e eo values of these processes were low ranging from 0 0290 to 16 76 kwh m3 order except for the work of gao et al 10 where e eo was unusually high for model solutions 415 58 kwh m3 order in contrast the works with real wastewater show higher energy consumption as in the present work 24 29 similarly ozturk and yilmaz performed electrochemical treatment of sww and the lowest electrical energy consumption achieved was 153 57 kwh m3 13 which is comparable to the current work nowadays uv persulfate process is considered as close to full scale application in wastewater treatment 68 however it should be taken into account that the e eo values are indicative and pilot scale testing is needed to determine its feasibility at a larger scale 69 3 6 formation of intermediates formic acid and acetic acid were determined using ion chromatography these compounds are the last intermediates that can be detected before the complete mineralization of the organic compounds to calculate the organic carbon oc of the remaining intermediates the final concentrations of toc formic acid and acetic acid were quantified the concentrations of the oc in the forms of the organic intermediates and mineralized co2 were indirectly calculated by the following material balances 9 oc intermediates final toc overall toc formic acid toc acetic acid 10 oc co 2 initial toc overall finaltoc overall the results are shown in fig s4 the increase in the concentration of h2o2 increased the formation of acids while the lowest concentration of intermediates other than acids was observed at 98 mm of h2o2 at the uv h2o2 process the adjustment of ph from neutral to acidic values also led to the increase in the formation of acids similarly the increment in fe ii concentration from 5 mg l to 20 mg l at the uv h2o2 fe ii process slightly decreased the concentration of intermediates moreover the coupling of this process with acidic ph elevated the co2 generation the least amount of unidentified intermediates 10 of toc was observed at the uv h2o2 fe ii process at ph 3 3 where 1 2 mg l of formic acid and 17 9 mg l of acetic acid were detected formic acid and acetic acid have not been found in the final solutions after experiments with the heterogeneous catalysts as it can be seen from fig s4 the increase in k2s2o8 concentration enhanced the mineralization of the intermediates through the formation of co2 finally the addition of fe ii did not improve the efficiency of the uv k2s2o8 contrary to the uv h2o2 fe ii process 4 conclusions in this work different photochemical treatment processes were used for the treatment of a real poultry sww the main objective was to find the most effective photochemical system for treating real wastewater with complex matrix considering the total organic carbon removal achieved the use of uv light alone and the use of the uv 4 fe tio2 process had negligible toc removal efficiencies while the use of undoped tio2 0 5 g l removed 44 of the toc after 60 min increasing the h2o2 concentration up to 98 mm was beneficial and resulted in 74 toc removal by the uv h2o2 method the use of higher iron concentrations was not beneficial to the efficiency of the process an initial ph adjustment to 3 3 did not significantly affect the toc removal in the uv h2o2 process but considerably increased the toc removal during the photo fenton treatment with 98 mm h2o2 and 20 mg l fe ii resulting in a toc removal of 82 5 after 150 min 1 2 mg l of formic acid and 17 9 mg l of acetic acid were detected using ic in the effluents after uv h2o2 fe ii process at ph 3 3 where only 10 of toc was not identified for the uv k2s2o8 system the use of 15 mm k2s2o8 resulted in 85 toc removal after 150 min while 73 5 toc removal was achieved when the photo fenton like process 15 mm k2s2o8 20 mg l fe ii was applied the uv k2s2o8 treatment had the lowest e eo value of 226 kwh m3 order the effluent quality of uv k2s2o8 treatment was below the discharge limits of the current legislation of the usa canada australia and european countries in order to meet the wastewater disposal regulations and reuse the treated water the uv k2s2o8 process can be used as a post treatment

magnetic mxene nanocomposites water pollutants water treatment 1 introduction nowadays the shortage of healthy water resources has become a global challenge problems associated with water pollution are increasing freshwater is used for drinking food public health environmental protection industrial and urban development and ultimately sustainable development and its shortage have raised widespread concerns worldwide 1 4 the imbalance between water resources and demand for freshwater and the accumulation of polluting wastewater and sewage has become more serious now than any time before 5 7 the water crisis is not limited to available water but is now more related to the low quality of water due to toxic pollution and human intervention in the water cycle and nature therefore it is crucially important to balance water supply and demand at the regional national and local scales 8 12 there are various types of freshwater contaminants like physical chemical organic and inorganic biological and radiological contaminants 9 13 14 therefore water treatment has a vital role in degrading pollutants from water resources wastewater sewage etc there are many technologies for water purification currently used technologies are based on filtration biological treatment reverse osmosis electric flotation air flotation gravity separation membrane bioreactors chemical precipitation chemical coagulation adsorption with activated carbon and use of nanoparticles but most of these technologies are costly and time consuming 9 15 17 the use of nanoparticles in membranes or filter structures to effectively treat drinking water is relatively fast and rather inexpensive this offers opportunities to remove pollutants and significantly recycle industrial wastewater while reducing costs time and workforce 9 15 16 18 mxene nanoparticles are among the essential nanomaterials that have recently attracted much attention for water treatment max phases are new 2d nanomaterials with a sheet like structure made from transition metal nitrides carbides and carbonitrides 19 20 mxene is obtained from max phase etching after removing aluminum elements out from the max structure 21 beyond other nanostructures like graphene 22 23 calcium based nanomaterials 24 25 carbon nanotubes 26 28 and titanium nanotubes 29 30 the sizeable specific surface areas inherent metallic conductivity hydrophilicity high electron density and large surface functional moieties has made mxene a promising candidate in the fields of water treatment 31 32 photo electrocatalysis 33 therapeutic 34 biosensing 35 37 photothermal therapy 38 and diagnosis 34 due to the unique chemical and physical properties of mxene like high surface active area large hydrophilic sites high melting point appropriate structural and good chemical stability high resistance to oxidation outstanding electrical conductivity and attractive thermal properties it could be a very useful candidate for wastewater treatment mxene as an alternative option for water treatment applications has been introduced as next generation material for the degradation of environmental contaminants 15 31 39 42 one of the excellent properties and high efficiencies of mxene based material grades is magnetic mxene nanocomposites when mxene makes composite with magnetic nanoparticles the efficiency of degradation of pollutant will be increased on the other hand magnetic materials can significantly enhance the efficiency of removal of heavy metals as one of the most dangerous pollutants in the water resources 13 31 39 40 43 44 magnetic nanomaterials are used in a multitude of applications for example generators motors actuators and sensors transformers mobile communications information storage security transport diagnostic devices defense and aerospace and electromagnetic waves absorber materials 45 50 magnetic nanoparticles due to several advantages like good electrical conductivity easy preparation small size high surface to volume ratio liquid solid separation fast process reusability magnetic separation and more outstanding biocompatibility are ideal candidates when it comes to the wastewater treatment sewage and water resources recovery 9 51 54 due to the excellent properties of mxene based magnetic nanomaterials easy synthesis low cost preparation and their applications in the degradation of water pollutants these nanocomposites are known to be effective options with a high efficiency way to treat water resources such as drinking water wastewater sewage etc hence in the current review the application of magnetic mxene nanocomposites for removing contaminants from aqueous media was considered for this purpose water treatment and degradation of water pollutants by using magnetic nanomaterials mxene nanoparticles and mxene based magnetic materials will be discussed future works and research trends on mxene and magnetic mxene nanomaterials for water treatment and environmental applications will also be discussed several recent reviews have been published on the use of mxene for energy conversion and storage 15 33 55 57 and environmental applications 16 19 58 60 nevertheless according to the authors knowledge this is the first review of magnetic mxene nanocomposites for the degradation of water pollutants and wastewater treatments 2 magnetic nanomaterials for water treatment before discussing water treatment by magnetic materials magnetic properties are briefly reviewed the magnetic properties of atoms molecules and ions are primarily related to their electronic arrangements the electronic arrangement can lead to magnetic moments in fact in charged particles an electron spins around itself or the nucleus to create a magnetic moment resulting in the magnetic field magnetic materials have been classified to five categories include diamagnetic paramagnetic ferrimagnetic ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic 61 63 magnetic materials are used in a multidisciplinary application in water treatment transportation communications information technology actuators and sensors transformers and motors generators security microwave aerospace military and diagnostic devices 13 45 49 64 increasing the pollutants in water resources especially groundwater is one of the biggest global problems especially in groundwater rich countries among the groundwater pollutants pharmaceutical and pesticide contaminants can increase cancer risks 65 66 the discharge of pollutants into water poses many risks to human health and is harmful to human and aquatic life the mixture of hospital wastes phenolic compounds from industrial factories and agricultural pesticides in groundwater creates new diseases on the other hand many forbidden and harmful additives in food such as azo dyes could contaminate pure water and create health issues for humans e g alteration of human intestinal microflora skin microflora various carcinogenic effects and casing allergies 67 69 the nanoparticles in various forms morphologies and shapes such as nanoparticles containing metals carbon nanomaterials 23 ag ion exchanged zeolite tio2 12 znago 70 dendrimers nanotubes and nanofibers are used for water treatment 9 12 71 72 notwithstanding the extraordinary evidence due to the separation between liquid and solid particles it is often a challenge to reduce particle size from micro to nanoscale with uniform size distribution to be used in accurate detection and practical methods magnetic materials have recently gained lots of attention in the degradation of pollutants in water resources wastewater groundwater pharmaceutical and pesticide contaminants these materials prevent the solid separation phase from the liquid phase they are also helpful to remove water pollutants via separation method by magnetic filtration 8 73 74 the magnetic materials have several other advantages for degradation of water pollutants such as porosity high surface area cost effectiveness low diffusional resistance easy preparation environmentally friendly good electrical conductivity size liquid solid separation reusability and excellent biocompatibility 8 13 75 therefore magnetic materials are known as a promising candidate for water treatment these materials mainly include iron oxides multiwalled carbon nanotube based magnetic adsorbents superparamagnetic etc 8 76 78 there are various synthesis methods for magnetic materials viz ceramic techniques ion exchange melting salts coprecipitation hydrothermal citrate synthesis glass crystallization sol gel solvothermal combustion route self propagating high temperature synthesis sonochemical spray drying microemulsions water in oil 9 79 the synthesis method of magnetic nanoparticles can determine the particle size morphology distribution surface performance and magnetic properties and in turn their various applications 45 80 81 one of the applications of magnetic materials in water treatment is in the area of heavy metals removal typically heavy metal refers to metal elements with a high atomic weight and a density of at least five times greater than water 82 unlike organic pollutants heavy metals are not biodegradable and tend to accumulate in living organisms when released into the environment 83 86 due to the increase of industrial activities such as steel oil and gas textiles leather paper etc the heavy metals contaminations like hg as co cu pb sn cr ni pd v ag zn cd pt enter water resources and harm human health and environment 87 102 almomani et al 44 fabricated magnetic nanoparticles grafted hyperbranched polyglycerol polymer to remove heavy metals such as al ni and cu from industrial wastewater they found maximum adsorption was reached at 0 790 0 451 and 0 700 g mg 1 for al ni and cu respectively their results confirmed that the heavy metals successfully adsorbed on the surface of magnetic nanocomposite through interactions between hydroxyl groups therefore it proposed that the adsorption mechanism could be controlled by a complicated mechanism between heavy metals and hydroxyl groups the adsorption mechanisms are multistep including molecular diffusion and surface binding similar mechanisms were concluded by xue et al 103 they studied the effect of ph on heavy metals ni2 cd2 cu2 pb2 adsorption mechanism in water media by modifying magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 with oxidized modified humic acid ha o their results demonstrated that the adsorption ability of heavy metals by magnetic nanocomposite followed a similar trend as pb2 cu2 cd2 ni2 also the adsorption mechanisms have abstained so that at higher ph the complexation was predominant while at lower ph cation exchange was predominant the schematic of fe3o4 nanoparticles modified with ha o acid has been shown in fig 1 103 the relatively similar results were obtained with other studies on the use of magnetic materials to remove heavy metals in aqueous media 104 107 for example the ni2 ions have been removed from aqueous environments by using magnetic nanoparticles 105 106 these works exhibited that adsorption is the main mechanism for the removal of ni2 ions other heavy metals ions such as cr6 cr2 co2 and cd2 were also eliminated by magnetic nanocomposites according to the adsorption mechanism 107 110 the studies indicate that absorption is the main mechanism for the removal of heavy metal ions in water media based on the studies four proposed adsorption mechanisms are ion exchange electrostatic adsorption surface physical adsorption and complexation chelation 103 111 generally the removal mechanism of heavy metals contaminants in magnetic nanoparticles is surface adsorption and ion exchange magnetic materials have higher efficiency compared to other conventional methods due to their high surface area high adsorption capacity and high affinity for removing heavy metals from aqueous solutions 112 114 organic dye contaminants are other groups of pollutants routinely found in water resources and classified into cationic dyes and anionic dyes this group is also degraded by magnetic materials the self heating nanocatalysts iron oxide was synthesized by a polyol method for induced magnetically degradation of cationic methylene blue and anionic dyes acid orange 8 by gallo cordova et al 115 decolorization of cationic and anionic dyes by exposing the nanocatalyst to the alternating magnetic fields combined with a suddenly increase in temperature at the nanocatalyst surface enhanced the decolorization efficiency with a high degradation rate and 100 efficiency they concluded the plausible mechanism for degradation of organic pollutants could be due to the production of oh generated which is produced in the reaction of fe2 with hydrogen peroxide 115 the fe3o4 and guar gum nanocomposites gc fe3o4 were fabricated for photodegradation of mutagenic and carcinogenic dyes crystal violet cv 98 94 and indigo carmine ic 97 61 by kumar et al 108 their results showed that the magnetic based nanocomposite has a high potential for degradation of dyes under direct irritation of sunlight and this research is a suitable and cost effective idea for industrial wastewater detoxification the proposed mechanism for sunlight degradation of nanocomposite could be explained in the following when the sunlight irradiates on the magnetic based nanocomposite the negative electrons and positive holes are created on the surface of nanocomposites due to the excitation of electrons from the valence band to conduction band resulting in the formation of electron hole pairs the electrons in the conduction band of magnetic nanocomposite could reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide and the holes in the valence band react with hydroxy ions or water to produce hydroxyl radicals and cause to degradation of the dyes because of determining the active species involved in the degradation process the scavenging and inhibiting studies were also performed by using p benzoquinone ammonium oxalate and butyl alcohol they were found that since the active moieties h oh and o2 are captured by their respective scavengers the dye degradation efficiency cv reduces from 98 94 to 78 37 50 09 and 43 25 respectively these results suggest that oh and o2 play a more critical role than h in the dye photodegradation process 108 green synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles is increasingly being considered as an environmentally friendly rapid and easily scalable technology razavi et al 116 fabricated the magnetic plasmonic m type ferrites nanocomposites for photodegradation of triaryl methane mono azo anthraquinone and diazo by applying a green synthesis route they found that the aromatic structure of azo dyes leads to these dyes being stable against oxidation and light also due to the presence of electron receptor carbonyl group in the anthraquinone structure as well as higher resistance to degradation arising from the aromatic fused anthraquinone structure cause to increase the stability of the dyes in wastewaters the triaryl methane showed the maximum degradation 93 than other dyes studied at this work 116 the separable magnetic nanophotocatalysts cofe2o4 rgo cfog led pms were successfully synthesized via a simple one step solvothermal route by zhang et al 117 for synergistic degradation of organic contaminants by activating peroxymonosulfate under light emitting diode led irradiation the remarkable photodegradation performance of target pollutants such as congo red rhodamine b and tetracycline proved that the cfog led pms system could be considered as a prominent candidate possessing wide applicability for degrading of organic contaminants the proposed mechanism of synergic photodegradation of the cfog led pms system has been shown in fig 2 as it could be observed in fig 2 cofe2o4 induced electrons are transferred to the rgo surface to produce o2 due to instability and high activity of o2 it can be converted to oh co2 can catalyze peroxymonosulfate to produce so4 and co3 so that the co3 causes to regenerate of co2 and so4 after reaction with peroxymonosulfate thus co3 and co2 can be converted together to generate so4 continuously and led to oxidize organic pollutant molecules similar reactions occur in fe3 and fe2 ions apart from cofe2o4 the rgo could be activated the peroxymonosulfate through electron conduction peroxymonosulfate can react with electrons provided by rgo to produce so4 which can also avoid rapid electron hole pair recombination briefly the improvement of photodegradation performance of the cfog led pms system was promoted by the synergistic effects between the sr fenton process and photocatalysis 117 the main mechanisms for the removal of cationic dyes and anionic dyes are related to physical and chemical adsorption due to the high surface to volume ratio of magnetic nanoparticles the mechanisms are multilayer and monolayer for the cationic and anionic dyes respectively 9 12 13 118 121 various bacteria and overuse of different antibiotics such as amoxicillin diphenhydramine and penicillin in health and medical centers have made medical wastewater a significant and dangerous challenge 12 122 124 high performance and nontoxicity of poly allylamine hydrochloride paah stabilized magnetic nanoparticles were reported to eliminate the escherichia coli acinetobacter spp pseudomonas spp and bacillus spp in drinking water 125 moreover cu doped mgo through a hydrophilic carbon layer fe3o4 c mgo cu could be introduced as another antibacterial agent in aqueous conditions since its high activity against various gram positive and gram negative was fully approved 126 the magnetic shell nanostructures on the fe3o4 core surface is another magnetic nanocomposite of iron that showed suitable potential in removing common bacterial contamination and could be used in the domestic water treatment system 127 in addition two crucial bacterial waterborne pathogens e coli and vibrio cholera could be efficiently controlled in aqueous conditions using ferromagnetic ni doped zno nanoparticles amine functionalized magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 sio2 nh2 captured a wide range of gram positive and gram negative pathogens 128 vigorously theatrically the magnetic compounds against e coli could be considered as antibacterial agents against the other waterborne pathogens shigella sonnei and shigella flexneri for instance 129 132 due to the high physiological and genomic similarity on the other the potential of the magnetic nanoparticles in water treatment is not limited to bacterial contamination and extended to be used again for protozoa and parasites for instance iron oxide nanoparticles coated with chitosan oligosaccharide removed cysts like entamoeba cyst and active forms of entamoeba histolytica from contaminated water sources 133 efficiently besides the advantages of magnetic nanoparticles as antibacterial agents their potential for eliminating synthetic antibiotics has been reported earlier ciprofloxacin could be erased using a catalytic degradation mechanism mediated by fe3o4 α mno2 in contrast some chemicals such as amoxicillin ampicillin atenolol gemfibrozil sulfamethoxazole and minocycline could be removed by other mechanisms like adsorption mediated by maghemite fe2o3 core confined in a porous silica layer mnfe2o4 activated carbon ac or mgfe2o4 γ fe2o3 134 138 liu et al 74 synthesized magnetic architecture fe3o4 sio2 bi2o2co3 sepiolite nanoparticles by hydrothermal route for degradation of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline hydrochloride from water media their results showed that the photodegradation properties stability recyclability and magnetic separation efficiency were excellent and the photodegradation was 92 1 and 100 after 90 min for ciprofloxacin and tetracycline hydrochloride respectively pan et al 73 synthesized magnetic pollutant hydrogel inspired by mussel as fenton like catalysts with doping magnetic polydopamine nanoparticles into hydrogels to remove antibiotics from medical wastewater they showed that the degradation efficiency of tetracycline is 86 32 after 60 min of exposure and the plausible mechanism for degradation of tetracycline is the formation of a complex between the sites on the fe3o4 surface fe2 which possibly react with h2o2 in the first step tetracycline was easily inserted into the hydrogel with the help of π π interactions electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding between antibiotic tetracycline and porous hydrogel then h2o2 was added passed through a network of porous hydrogels and interacted with fe3o4 to produce ho radicals eventually ho 1 radicals attacked the tetracycline and destroyed the tetracycline fig 3 represents the schematic of mentioned mechanism 73 3 mxene applications and advantages among different nanomaterials 2d transition metal carbide materials termed mxene have recently attracted lots of attention because they offer many attractive features and promising performances in cancer theragnostic imaging strategies and biosensor based diagnostic tools 139 142 max phases are relatively new 2d nanomaterials with a sheet like structure made from transition metal carbides nitrides and carbonitrides mxene is obtained from the etching of the max phase and removing of aluminum element out from the max structure 21 compared to other nanomaterials such as graphene 22 calcium based nanomaterials 24 25 carbon nanotubes 26 27 and titanium nanotubes 29 30 max phase is known to have sizeable specific surface areas inherent metallic conductivity hydrophilicity high electron density and large surface functional moieties these characteristics have made mxene an interesting candidate in the fields of therapeutic 34 biosensing 35 37 photothermal therapy 38 diagnosis 34 and water treatment 31 32 in recent years the use of mxene for water treatment has been increasing as mentioned above there are several contaminations in water resources heavy metals are essential sources of highly toxic contaminants that are difficult to remove or decompose in organisms if used beyond a specific limit they are dangerous for human health animals and the environment several methods have been proposed to remove heavy metals including chemical coagulation 143 precipitation 9 electrochemical 16 33 solvent extraction 9 15 113 membrane processes 144 ion exchange 12 adsorption 145 photocatalysis 12 and evaporation 9 12 from water resources wastewater sewage drinking water etc 12 15 146 147 due to easy operation and low costs absorption techniques have become more interesting in the last years with that said mxene as a 2d nanomaterial with a sheet like structure appears to be an excellent candidate for the degradation of heavy metals by adsorption technique 146 148 156 mxene also removes radioactive heavy metals fig 4 shows the schematic of several radioactive heavy metals removed by mxene 157 shahzad et al 151 fabricated ti3c2tx mxene nanosheets to remove copper from water solutions their results showed that ti3c2tx mxene could remove copper due to unique functional features hydrophilicity excellent surface area and dispersibility the proposed mechanism for copper removal was determined by contributing functional ionic active groups o oh f on the surface of mxene as possible sites to absorb heavy metals ions guo et al 153 showed that 2d alkalization mxene could remove heavy metal ions effectively in aqueous media by providing sufficient pairs of opposite spin electrons to adsorb heavy metal ions due to the formation of the hydrogen traps feng et al 155 have also developed 2d alkalization mxene ldh adsorber by hydrothermal route to degrade ni ions from the aqueous media their findings exhibited that the possible mechanism for degradation of ni ii is chemical absorption fu et al 158 removed hg2 ions from water solution using ti3c2ox mxene by catalyst reduction or adsorption reduction redox reaction mechanism based on their proposed mechanism the edge of 001 ti plays a major role in the removal of hg2 ions the terminated 001 face of ti on the edge of mxene nanosheets microstructures functionalizes and acts as both an efficient adsorption site for hg2 ions capture and active catalytic sites for hg2 ions reduction resulting in ultra rapid removal of hg2 ions the catalyst reduction or adsorption reduction mechanism of alkalization mxene ldh has been represented in fig 5 158 water organic pollutants e g cationic and anionic dyes critically threaten the food ecosystem stability agricultural products and human health due to high toxicity and so hard to remove these pollutants the degradation mechanism of organic pollutants is mainly photocatalyst and biodegradation the absorption mechanism could not decompose the organic pollutants well and will be disposed to secondary contaminations 159 161 the photocatalytic degradations have been significantly improved by using mxene and mxene based materials to decrease the water pollutants 160 162 in a study a derived mxene nanohybrid as bifeo3 ti3c2 was fabricated to increase photocatalytic activity for degrading organic dyes and colorless pollutants the results indicated that due to the high surface area of nanohybrid the electron hole pairs produced with irradiating of visible light combined with o2 electrons and oh holes to create superoxide free hydroxyl radicals based on this mechanism photocatalytic degradation is found to be 100 efficient for congo red and acetophenone as an organic dye and colorless aqueous pollutants respectively 163 cui et al 162 loaded bi2wo6 on nb2ctx mxene nanosheets through an easy hydrothermal process to focus on the degradation of selected dyes rhodamine b methylene blue and tetracycline hydrochloride in aqueous media the hybrid nanosheets combined with high special surface area showed significantly enhanced photodegradation performance the photodegradation exhibited excellent efficiency for methylene blue 92 7 rhodamine b 99 8 and tetracycline hydrochloride 83 1 respectively the remarkably photocatalytic mechanism of nanohybrid is due to the construction intimated interaction between nb2ctx and bi2wo6 under the irradiation of visible light the photo generated electrons are produced by exciting nanosheets the photo generated electrons are accumulated on the bi2wo6 conduction band and transferred to the nb2ctx conduction band as a result nb2ctx could be acted as an electron capture trap in addition a schottky barrier is created at the nanohybrid interface that suppressed the recombination of photo generated electron hole pairs and led to improve the photocatalytic performance of nanohybrid other mxene based compounds are used in the degradation of organic pollutants in aqueous media the proposed mechanism of photodegradation of hybrid nanosheets has been shown in fig 6 generally the degradation mechanism is based on photocatalytic activity by producing free radicals 159 162 164 165 the conjugated compound of bi2s3 ti3c2tx intensely reduced the amount of staphylococcus aureus 99 86 and escherichia coli 99 92 in only 10 min 166 moreover methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa could also be efficiently eliminated 99 using ti3c2tx mxene polydopamine mxene pda 167 zheng et al 168 synthesized multifunctional mxene ceo2 nanocomposites by combining ti3c2tx mxenes and antioxidant ceo2 this compound can be effectively used against a wide range of multidrug resistant mdr bacterial pathogens in another report he et al 12 169 synthesized the monolayer tivctx which showed a high bactericidal potential against e coli and b subtilis a gram positive spore forming bacteria interestingly wu et al 170 established a fast easy to handle and broad spectrum antibacterial method using a combination of mxene and light 808 nm ti3c2 mxenes in the presence of light showed remarkable antibacterial influence on different isolates of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa vancomycin resistant enterococci vre and even mrsa biofilms in another work mansoorianfar et al 20 the mxene nanofragments ti3c2 nanosheets tightly bound to bacteriophages for modification of bacteriophage surface by fe2 fe3 ions that remarkably improved the antibacterial performance the high toxicity of bacterial at the fe modified ti3c2 nanosheets was attributed to the reduced edges of ti3c2 nanofragments which provided intense interaction sharp edges and oxidative stress with bacteria they showed that the mxene functionalized bacteriophages could be more effective against bacteria even in concentrations lower than mxene s mic since the conjugated aptamer has greater specificity for recognizing and targeting host receptors besides mxene nanofragments are driven to interact positively with bacteria due to the positive induced surface moieties their proposed mechanisms were the bacteriophage s specific targeting capability often by bursting out and lysing of the host and the interaction between mxene and bacterial cell which cause to rupture of the bacterial cell wall they also concluded that in aquatic environments during the long standing cultivation both stability and adsorption rate of bacteriophage significantly increased with ti3c2 mxene offering superior antibacterial activity against bacterial cells the mxene laden bacteriophage took up and attached to host bacteria quickly effectively and reduced 99 99 of deliberately added contaminations in water samples interestingly to note no regrowth of the target bacteria occurred after infection with the ti3c2 mxene bacteriophage during the experiment period and the number of bacteria stayed constantly lower than the detection threshold 20 4 magnetic mxene based nanocomposites for water treatment the advantages and disadvantages of mxene and magnetic materials in removing water pollutants and the governing mechanisms were discussed in detail in previous sections despite the specific benefits of magnetic materials due to the intrinsic properties of magnetic nanoparticles and consequently magnetic interactions between nanoparticles they are prone to accumulation and agglomeration therefore the ability and efficiency of magnetic nanoparticles for water treatment may be relatively reduced 33 although mxene also has good properties for removing hazardous contaminants in aqueous media however mxene has relative toxicity and also tends to agglomerate and oxidize on the other hand due to the intrinsic properties of mxene such as high colloidal ability its separation in aqueous media is too difficult also the large size of the mxene molecules act as a barrier to electron transfer at the interface and it is almost impossible to create a perfect contact surface for transferring electron in the interface however all of the above has been affected by the use of mxene its performance and its applications although both magnetic materials and mxene have shown excellent properties for water treatment especially when it comes to the removal of heavy metals ions and environmental remediation surface functionalization of mxene and magnetic nanoparticles are essential to improve their applications and minimize their disadvantages while increasing their efficiency and avoiding wasting time energy and costs therefore surface functionalization of mxene materials and magnetic nanoparticles have been rapidly developing as effective metal oxide nanocomposites to remove various water contaminants such as heavy metals and organic pollutants 171 174 fe2o3 nanoparticles are widely investigated as water treatment and therapy mediators due to their significant magnetic moments 134 135 137 138 163 173 175 hybrid fe2o3 ti3c2tx magnetic mxene mgmx nanocomposites were fabricated by hydrothermal technique as a purifier for removal of hg2 ions as most toxic heavy metals mg2 ca2 na and k ions as background metals from aqueous media the metal ions concentration decreased by using mgmx as an adsorber so that the concentration of hg2 ions reached from 2 29 to 0 02 mg 1 this study revealed that the mgmx nanocomposites have a great potential in removing hg2 ions due to the existence of excessive anion groups like o2 and oh and other negative surface charges 173 in another study 176 a unique mxene magnetic sandwich structure nanocomposite aroused tremendous enthusiasm for the efficient separation of phosphate from water resources the ultrafine magnetic nanoparticles nano fe2o3 embed into the interior layers of mxene to increase the number of available ti oh active layers and widen the distance between the layers while the intercalator magnetic nanoparticles nano fe3o4 as exterior surface endowed the easy separation it also ensured and guaranteed the excellent selective absorption of phosphate with high efficiency and fast kinetics due to the stimulated surface of the two dimensional ti oh terminated layered within mxene and fe oh exchanged sites of ferric oxide intercalation this mechanism and the nanocomposite synthesis method are shown in fig 7 176 yang et al 177 2d mxene nanosheets ti3c2tx and various amounts of self assembly magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 decorated on the surface of cellulose acetate membrane as nanofiltration for removal heavy metal ions cu2 cd2 and cr6 from wastewater the efficiency of this nanocomposite was compared with pure mxene nanosheets to remove these cationic contaminants the obtained results showed that the removal ratio values of cu2 cd2 and cr6 increased for magnetic mxene nanocomposite compared to pure mxene from 29 7 to 63 2 for cu2 30 7 to 64 1 for cd2 and 32 8 to 70 2 for cr6 on the other hand the removal percentages of heavy metal ions also increased with increasing magnetic phase contents a plausible mechanism for magnetic mxene nanofiltrations was proposed based on the mass transfer between neighbor mxene nanosheets oh groups on mxene surface which help create absorption sites for heavy metal pollutants generally because of excellent properties such as excessive surface area recyclability high hydrophilicity phase stability in aqueous media and a good performance against contaminations magnetic mxene nanocomposites are remarkably good candidates when it comes to the elimination of metal ions from water media 173 176 178 more organic pollutants such as hazardous refractory contaminations and dyes are nowadays widely discharged to water resources due to increasing population and global industrialization many organic pollutants are often toxic and harmful to the ecological system and also humans animals and plants 43 171 178 181 alkaline hydrothermal treatment as a one step strategy was used to load fe3o4 on ti3c2 mxene to remove organic dyes including methyl orange rhodamine b methylene blue and congo red cui et al 178 they concluded that free radical groups consisting of superoxide o2 and hydroperoxyl radicals oh have a crucial task in the photodegradation process of organic dyes in aqueous media in another report 43 magnetic mxene nanocomposite α fe2o3 znfe2o4 ti3c2 was synthesized with a similar methodology to simultaneously remove organic pollutants and cr6 as a heavy metal ion with a visible light assistant the presence of magnetic and mxene phases increases conductivity at the heterostructure interface and enhances the absorption of visible light therefore degradation ability and photocatalytic properties could be extraordinarily increased zhang et al 181 anchored two dimensional α fe2o3 nanosheets on the layers of ti3c2 mxene through a self assembly method assisted by facile ultrasonic for photodegradation of rhodamine b the organic dye degradation rate obtained more than 90 and the proposed mechanism included charges transfer on the ɑ fe2o3 ti3c2 intimate nanocomposite interfaces increasing drug resistance is now a critical worldwide concern threatening public health hygiene 182 186 eco friendly substances are promising alternatives for the present antimicrobial agents nife2o4 mxene heterostructure as eco friendly magnetic mxene nanocomposite was fabricated by rasheed et al 179 to enhance photocatalytic degradation activity and antibacterial performance and compared to individual mxene and nife2o4 nanosheets in wastewater media they concluded that sheet to sheet bonding provides an appreciable opportunity for superior degradation of wastewater pollutants and antibacterial activity furthermore the heterostructure nanocomposite represented outstanding antibacterial activity against gram negative e coli bacteria while the degradation mechanism of methylene blue has been explained via degradation kinetic study of process fig 8 demonstrated the possible mechanism of photodegradation methylene blue dye in the presence of nife2o4 mxene nano photocatalyst 179 other studies have been done on the effect of magnetic mxene nanocomposites on the degradation of antibiotics in wastewater media 33 39 40 187 iron based nanoscale mxene nzvi ti3c2 nanosheets were prepared by in situ reductive precipitation path and identified as an outstanding fenton like catalyst for degradation of ranitidine this study indicated that the iron based nanoscale mxene nanocomposite could well degrade ranitidine the proposed mechanism for degradation ranitidine includes five steps 1 antibiotic molecule diffuses and adsorb on the surface of nzvi ti3c2 nanosheets 2 the nzvi particles are subject to oxidation corrosion 3 cyclic transformation occurs fe3 iii fe2 fe activates 4 h2o2 molecule 5 hydroxyl radicals react with the antibiotic fig 9 represents the details of the possible mechanism for degradation of ranitidine by nanocomposite z table 1 summarizes the degradation properties of heavy metals ions organic pollutants bacteria and antibiotics by magnetic mxene nanocomposites in various water media 5 future prospects and conclusions several desirable properties of mxenes make them suitable for environmental remediation such as hydrophilicity absorbable soluble in water nontoxicity activated metallic hydroxide sites antimicrobial agents and high surface area the mxene compounds are not only discussed for applications in water treatment researchers also try to address how they could be useful in other approaches of photocatalysts sensors emi shields the new generation of antibacterial materials and anti biofouling compounds to the best of our knowledge presently there are three main types of mxene applications associated with water treatment membranes adsorbents and electrode materials as well as discussing toxicity and environmental impact the researchers note that despite previous studies showing biocompatibility and nonacute toxicity of mxenes recent studies have found mxene is capable to cause cytoplasmic membrane destruction by passing through bacterial membranes potentially disturbing the prokaryotic cells function which could eventually result in bacteria death in this review the wide range of applications of magnetic mxene in water purification methods and a comprehensive application of mxene for water and wastewater treatment have been demonstrated the enormous studies about mxene have provided a clear perspective based on an understanding of mxene and how mxene is different from the spinel ferrite recently used for water and wastewater treatment in addition to conventional magnetic materials the use of magnetic materials such as hexagonal ferrites and other environmentally friendly magnetic materials in the form of magnetic mxene based nanocomposites can be considered for future works the future of mxene and magnetic mxene nanocomposites in pollution removal has raised attention in proposing many novel compounds to be synthesized through simple one step techniques devoid of shortcomings of present nanomaterials especially as photothermal membrane distillation filtering and antibacterial membranes in the case of the antibacterial property of both magnetic nanoparticles and mxene the induced positive surface moieties drive magnetic mxene nanocomposites toward the negative surface charge of bacteria with the primary mechanism of physical interaction with the bacterial cell membrane which may rupture the cell wall also in photothermal membrane distillation irradiation by the laser causes surface plasmon activation generating random dipoles and resonance and finally light heat conversion which is the primary reason for magnetic mxene nanosheets to show photothermal performance for pollution removal finally it is essential to accurately detail all methods of water purifications by mxene material this review aimed to provide an update on the last progress in the field and discussed the concept of using magnetic mxene nanocomposites for contaminants removal from water the proposed highlights in the present study would be helpful for future trends on mxene s and magnetic mxene nanomaterials for water treatment and

13016,an increase in the pollutants such as hazardous refractory contaminations organic dyes pharmaceutical and pesticide contaminants which are widely disposed to water resources due to population and global industrialization is becoming one of the most significant health issues in the world due to the unique properties easy production low cost preparation and excellent degradation of water and wastewater pollutants magnetic mxene nanocomposites are promising candidates with many attractive characteristics these composites offer new fascinating perspectives in various applications such as biosensors cancer theragnostic imaging strategies and especially in water treatment this paper reviews magnetic mxene nanocomposites for removing contaminants from aqueous environments the concept of using magnetic nanomaterials for water treatment mxene applications and implications for the degradation of water and wastewater pollutants and magnetic mxene nanocomposites for water treatment will be discussed future trends on mxene and magnetic mxene nanomaterials for water treatment and environmental applications will also be explained graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mxene magnetic mxene nanocomposites water pollutants water treatment 1 introduction nowadays the shortage of healthy water resources has become a global challenge problems associated with water pollution are increasing freshwater is used for drinking food public health environmental protection industrial and urban development and ultimately sustainable development and its shortage have raised widespread concerns worldwide 1 4 the imbalance between water resources and demand for freshwater and the accumulation of polluting wastewater and sewage has become more serious now than any time before 5 7 the water crisis is not limited to available water but is now more related to the low quality of water due to toxic pollution and human intervention in the water cycle and nature therefore it is crucially important to balance water supply and demand at the regional national and local scales 8 12 there are various types of freshwater contaminants like physical chemical organic and inorganic biological and radiological contaminants 9 13 14 therefore water treatment has a vital role in degrading pollutants from water resources wastewater sewage etc there are many technologies for water purification currently used technologies are based on filtration biological treatment reverse osmosis electric flotation air flotation gravity separation membrane bioreactors chemical precipitation chemical coagulation adsorption with activated carbon and use of nanoparticles but most of these technologies are costly and time consuming 9 15 17 the use of nanoparticles in membranes or filter structures to effectively treat drinking water is relatively fast and rather inexpensive this offers opportunities to remove pollutants and significantly recycle industrial wastewater while reducing costs time and workforce 9 15 16 18 mxene nanoparticles are among the essential nanomaterials that have recently attracted much attention for water treatment max phases are new 2d nanomaterials with a sheet like structure made from transition metal nitrides carbides and carbonitrides 19 20 mxene is obtained from max phase etching after removing aluminum elements out from the max structure 21 beyond other nanostructures like graphene 22 23 calcium based nanomaterials 24 25 carbon nanotubes 26 28 and titanium nanotubes 29 30 the sizeable specific surface areas inherent metallic conductivity hydrophilicity high electron density and large surface functional moieties has made mxene a promising candidate in the fields of water treatment 31 32 photo electrocatalysis 33 therapeutic 34 biosensing 35 37 photothermal therapy 38 and diagnosis 34 due to the unique chemical and physical properties of mxene like high surface active area large hydrophilic sites high melting point appropriate structural and good chemical stability high resistance to oxidation outstanding electrical conductivity and attractive thermal properties it could be a very useful candidate for wastewater treatment mxene as an alternative option for water treatment applications has been introduced as next generation material for the degradation of environmental contaminants 15 31 39 42 one of the excellent properties and high efficiencies of mxene based material grades is magnetic mxene nanocomposites when mxene makes composite with magnetic nanoparticles the efficiency of degradation of pollutant will be increased on the other hand magnetic materials can significantly enhance the efficiency of removal of heavy metals as one of the most dangerous pollutants in the water resources 13 31 39 40 43 44 magnetic nanomaterials are used in a multitude of applications for example generators motors actuators and sensors transformers mobile communications information storage security transport diagnostic devices defense and aerospace and electromagnetic waves absorber materials 45 50 magnetic nanoparticles due to several advantages like good electrical conductivity easy preparation small size high surface to volume ratio liquid solid separation fast process reusability magnetic separation and more outstanding biocompatibility are ideal candidates when it comes to the wastewater treatment sewage and water resources recovery 9 51 54 due to the excellent properties of mxene based magnetic nanomaterials easy synthesis low cost preparation and their applications in the degradation of water pollutants these nanocomposites are known to be effective options with a high efficiency way to treat water resources such as drinking water wastewater sewage etc hence in the current review the application of magnetic mxene nanocomposites for removing contaminants from aqueous media was considered for this purpose water treatment and degradation of water pollutants by using magnetic nanomaterials mxene nanoparticles and mxene based magnetic materials will be discussed future works and research trends on mxene and magnetic mxene nanomaterials for water treatment and environmental applications will also be discussed several recent reviews have been published on the use of mxene for energy conversion and storage 15 33 55 57 and environmental applications 16 19 58 60 nevertheless according to the authors knowledge this is the first review of magnetic mxene nanocomposites for the degradation of water pollutants and wastewater treatments 2 magnetic nanomaterials for water treatment before discussing water treatment by magnetic materials magnetic properties are briefly reviewed the magnetic properties of atoms molecules and ions are primarily related to their electronic arrangements the electronic arrangement can lead to magnetic moments in fact in charged particles an electron spins around itself or the nucleus to create a magnetic moment resulting in the magnetic field magnetic materials have been classified to five categories include diamagnetic paramagnetic ferrimagnetic ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic 61 63 magnetic materials are used in a multidisciplinary application in water treatment transportation communications information technology actuators and sensors transformers and motors generators security microwave aerospace military and diagnostic devices 13 45 49 64 increasing the pollutants in water resources especially groundwater is one of the biggest global problems especially in groundwater rich countries among the groundwater pollutants pharmaceutical and pesticide contaminants can increase cancer risks 65 66 the discharge of pollutants into water poses many risks to human health and is harmful to human and aquatic life the mixture of hospital wastes phenolic compounds from industrial factories and agricultural pesticides in groundwater creates new diseases on the other hand many forbidden and harmful additives in food such as azo dyes could contaminate pure water and create health issues for humans e g alteration of human intestinal microflora skin microflora various carcinogenic effects and casing allergies 67 69 the nanoparticles in various forms morphologies and shapes such as nanoparticles containing metals carbon nanomaterials 23 ag ion exchanged zeolite tio2 12 znago 70 dendrimers nanotubes and nanofibers are used for water treatment 9 12 71 72 notwithstanding the extraordinary evidence due to the separation between liquid and solid particles it is often a challenge to reduce particle size from micro to nanoscale with uniform size distribution to be used in accurate detection and practical methods magnetic materials have recently gained lots of attention in the degradation of pollutants in water resources wastewater groundwater pharmaceutical and pesticide contaminants these materials prevent the solid separation phase from the liquid phase they are also helpful to remove water pollutants via separation method by magnetic filtration 8 73 74 the magnetic materials have several other advantages for degradation of water pollutants such as porosity high surface area cost effectiveness low diffusional resistance easy preparation environmentally friendly good electrical conductivity size liquid solid separation reusability and excellent biocompatibility 8 13 75 therefore magnetic materials are known as a promising candidate for water treatment these materials mainly include iron oxides multiwalled carbon nanotube based magnetic adsorbents superparamagnetic etc 8 76 78 there are various synthesis methods for magnetic materials viz ceramic techniques ion exchange melting salts coprecipitation hydrothermal citrate synthesis glass crystallization sol gel solvothermal combustion route self propagating high temperature synthesis sonochemical spray drying microemulsions water in oil 9 79 the synthesis method of magnetic nanoparticles can determine the particle size morphology distribution surface performance and magnetic properties and in turn their various applications 45 80 81 one of the applications of magnetic materials in water treatment is in the area of heavy metals removal typically heavy metal refers to metal elements with a high atomic weight and a density of at least five times greater than water 82 unlike organic pollutants heavy metals are not biodegradable and tend to accumulate in living organisms when released into the environment 83 86 due to the increase of industrial activities such as steel oil and gas textiles leather paper etc the heavy metals contaminations like hg as co cu pb sn cr ni pd v ag zn cd pt enter water resources and harm human health and environment 87 102 almomani et al 44 fabricated magnetic nanoparticles grafted hyperbranched polyglycerol polymer to remove heavy metals such as al ni and cu from industrial wastewater they found maximum adsorption was reached at 0 790 0 451 and 0 700 g mg 1 for al ni and cu respectively their results confirmed that the heavy metals successfully adsorbed on the surface of magnetic nanocomposite through interactions between hydroxyl groups therefore it proposed that the adsorption mechanism could be controlled by a complicated mechanism between heavy metals and hydroxyl groups the adsorption mechanisms are multistep including molecular diffusion and surface binding similar mechanisms were concluded by xue et al 103 they studied the effect of ph on heavy metals ni2 cd2 cu2 pb2 adsorption mechanism in water media by modifying magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 with oxidized modified humic acid ha o their results demonstrated that the adsorption ability of heavy metals by magnetic nanocomposite followed a similar trend as pb2 cu2 cd2 ni2 also the adsorption mechanisms have abstained so that at higher ph the complexation was predominant while at lower ph cation exchange was predominant the schematic of fe3o4 nanoparticles modified with ha o acid has been shown in fig 1 103 the relatively similar results were obtained with other studies on the use of magnetic materials to remove heavy metals in aqueous media 104 107 for example the ni2 ions have been removed from aqueous environments by using magnetic nanoparticles 105 106 these works exhibited that adsorption is the main mechanism for the removal of ni2 ions other heavy metals ions such as cr6 cr2 co2 and cd2 were also eliminated by magnetic nanocomposites according to the adsorption mechanism 107 110 the studies indicate that absorption is the main mechanism for the removal of heavy metal ions in water media based on the studies four proposed adsorption mechanisms are ion exchange electrostatic adsorption surface physical adsorption and complexation chelation 103 111 generally the removal mechanism of heavy metals contaminants in magnetic nanoparticles is surface adsorption and ion exchange magnetic materials have higher efficiency compared to other conventional methods due to their high surface area high adsorption capacity and high affinity for removing heavy metals from aqueous solutions 112 114 organic dye contaminants are other groups of pollutants routinely found in water resources and classified into cationic dyes and anionic dyes this group is also degraded by magnetic materials the self heating nanocatalysts iron oxide was synthesized by a polyol method for induced magnetically degradation of cationic methylene blue and anionic dyes acid orange 8 by gallo cordova et al 115 decolorization of cationic and anionic dyes by exposing the nanocatalyst to the alternating magnetic fields combined with a suddenly increase in temperature at the nanocatalyst surface enhanced the decolorization efficiency with a high degradation rate and 100 efficiency they concluded the plausible mechanism for degradation of organic pollutants could be due to the production of oh generated which is produced in the reaction of fe2 with hydrogen peroxide 115 the fe3o4 and guar gum nanocomposites gc fe3o4 were fabricated for photodegradation of mutagenic and carcinogenic dyes crystal violet cv 98 94 and indigo carmine ic 97 61 by kumar et al 108 their results showed that the magnetic based nanocomposite has a high potential for degradation of dyes under direct irritation of sunlight and this research is a suitable and cost effective idea for industrial wastewater detoxification the proposed mechanism for sunlight degradation of nanocomposite could be explained in the following when the sunlight irradiates on the magnetic based nanocomposite the negative electrons and positive holes are created on the surface of nanocomposites due to the excitation of electrons from the valence band to conduction band resulting in the formation of electron hole pairs the electrons in the conduction band of magnetic nanocomposite could reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide and the holes in the valence band react with hydroxy ions or water to produce hydroxyl radicals and cause to degradation of the dyes because of determining the active species involved in the degradation process the scavenging and inhibiting studies were also performed by using p benzoquinone ammonium oxalate and butyl alcohol they were found that since the active moieties h oh and o2 are captured by their respective scavengers the dye degradation efficiency cv reduces from 98 94 to 78 37 50 09 and 43 25 respectively these results suggest that oh and o2 play a more critical role than h in the dye photodegradation process 108 green synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles is increasingly being considered as an environmentally friendly rapid and easily scalable technology razavi et al 116 fabricated the magnetic plasmonic m type ferrites nanocomposites for photodegradation of triaryl methane mono azo anthraquinone and diazo by applying a green synthesis route they found that the aromatic structure of azo dyes leads to these dyes being stable against oxidation and light also due to the presence of electron receptor carbonyl group in the anthraquinone structure as well as higher resistance to degradation arising from the aromatic fused anthraquinone structure cause to increase the stability of the dyes in wastewaters the triaryl methane showed the maximum degradation 93 than other dyes studied at this work 116 the separable magnetic nanophotocatalysts cofe2o4 rgo cfog led pms were successfully synthesized via a simple one step solvothermal route by zhang et al 117 for synergistic degradation of organic contaminants by activating peroxymonosulfate under light emitting diode led irradiation the remarkable photodegradation performance of target pollutants such as congo red rhodamine b and tetracycline proved that the cfog led pms system could be considered as a prominent candidate possessing wide applicability for degrading of organic contaminants the proposed mechanism of synergic photodegradation of the cfog led pms system has been shown in fig 2 as it could be observed in fig 2 cofe2o4 induced electrons are transferred to the rgo surface to produce o2 due to instability and high activity of o2 it can be converted to oh co2 can catalyze peroxymonosulfate to produce so4 and co3 so that the co3 causes to regenerate of co2 and so4 after reaction with peroxymonosulfate thus co3 and co2 can be converted together to generate so4 continuously and led to oxidize organic pollutant molecules similar reactions occur in fe3 and fe2 ions apart from cofe2o4 the rgo could be activated the peroxymonosulfate through electron conduction peroxymonosulfate can react with electrons provided by rgo to produce so4 which can also avoid rapid electron hole pair recombination briefly the improvement of photodegradation performance of the cfog led pms system was promoted by the synergistic effects between the sr fenton process and photocatalysis 117 the main mechanisms for the removal of cationic dyes and anionic dyes are related to physical and chemical adsorption due to the high surface to volume ratio of magnetic nanoparticles the mechanisms are multilayer and monolayer for the cationic and anionic dyes respectively 9 12 13 118 121 various bacteria and overuse of different antibiotics such as amoxicillin diphenhydramine and penicillin in health and medical centers have made medical wastewater a significant and dangerous challenge 12 122 124 high performance and nontoxicity of poly allylamine hydrochloride paah stabilized magnetic nanoparticles were reported to eliminate the escherichia coli acinetobacter spp pseudomonas spp and bacillus spp in drinking water 125 moreover cu doped mgo through a hydrophilic carbon layer fe3o4 c mgo cu could be introduced as another antibacterial agent in aqueous conditions since its high activity against various gram positive and gram negative was fully approved 126 the magnetic shell nanostructures on the fe3o4 core surface is another magnetic nanocomposite of iron that showed suitable potential in removing common bacterial contamination and could be used in the domestic water treatment system 127 in addition two crucial bacterial waterborne pathogens e coli and vibrio cholera could be efficiently controlled in aqueous conditions using ferromagnetic ni doped zno nanoparticles amine functionalized magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 sio2 nh2 captured a wide range of gram positive and gram negative pathogens 128 vigorously theatrically the magnetic compounds against e coli could be considered as antibacterial agents against the other waterborne pathogens shigella sonnei and shigella flexneri for instance 129 132 due to the high physiological and genomic similarity on the other the potential of the magnetic nanoparticles in water treatment is not limited to bacterial contamination and extended to be used again for protozoa and parasites for instance iron oxide nanoparticles coated with chitosan oligosaccharide removed cysts like entamoeba cyst and active forms of entamoeba histolytica from contaminated water sources 133 efficiently besides the advantages of magnetic nanoparticles as antibacterial agents their potential for eliminating synthetic antibiotics has been reported earlier ciprofloxacin could be erased using a catalytic degradation mechanism mediated by fe3o4 α mno2 in contrast some chemicals such as amoxicillin ampicillin atenolol gemfibrozil sulfamethoxazole and minocycline could be removed by other mechanisms like adsorption mediated by maghemite fe2o3 core confined in a porous silica layer mnfe2o4 activated carbon ac or mgfe2o4 γ fe2o3 134 138 liu et al 74 synthesized magnetic architecture fe3o4 sio2 bi2o2co3 sepiolite nanoparticles by hydrothermal route for degradation of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline hydrochloride from water media their results showed that the photodegradation properties stability recyclability and magnetic separation efficiency were excellent and the photodegradation was 92 1 and 100 after 90 min for ciprofloxacin and tetracycline hydrochloride respectively pan et al 73 synthesized magnetic pollutant hydrogel inspired by mussel as fenton like catalysts with doping magnetic polydopamine nanoparticles into hydrogels to remove antibiotics from medical wastewater they showed that the degradation efficiency of tetracycline is 86 32 after 60 min of exposure and the plausible mechanism for degradation of tetracycline is the formation of a complex between the sites on the fe3o4 surface fe2 which possibly react with h2o2 in the first step tetracycline was easily inserted into the hydrogel with the help of π π interactions electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding between antibiotic tetracycline and porous hydrogel then h2o2 was added passed through a network of porous hydrogels and interacted with fe3o4 to produce ho radicals eventually ho 1 radicals attacked the tetracycline and destroyed the tetracycline fig 3 represents the schematic of mentioned mechanism 73 3 mxene applications and advantages among different nanomaterials 2d transition metal carbide materials termed mxene have recently attracted lots of attention because they offer many attractive features and promising performances in cancer theragnostic imaging strategies and biosensor based diagnostic tools 139 142 max phases are relatively new 2d nanomaterials with a sheet like structure made from transition metal carbides nitrides and carbonitrides mxene is obtained from the etching of the max phase and removing of aluminum element out from the max structure 21 compared to other nanomaterials such as graphene 22 calcium based nanomaterials 24 25 carbon nanotubes 26 27 and titanium nanotubes 29 30 max phase is known to have sizeable specific surface areas inherent metallic conductivity hydrophilicity high electron density and large surface functional moieties these characteristics have made mxene an interesting candidate in the fields of therapeutic 34 biosensing 35 37 photothermal therapy 38 diagnosis 34 and water treatment 31 32 in recent years the use of mxene for water treatment has been increasing as mentioned above there are several contaminations in water resources heavy metals are essential sources of highly toxic contaminants that are difficult to remove or decompose in organisms if used beyond a specific limit they are dangerous for human health animals and the environment several methods have been proposed to remove heavy metals including chemical coagulation 143 precipitation 9 electrochemical 16 33 solvent extraction 9 15 113 membrane processes 144 ion exchange 12 adsorption 145 photocatalysis 12 and evaporation 9 12 from water resources wastewater sewage drinking water etc 12 15 146 147 due to easy operation and low costs absorption techniques have become more interesting in the last years with that said mxene as a 2d nanomaterial with a sheet like structure appears to be an excellent candidate for the degradation of heavy metals by adsorption technique 146 148 156 mxene also removes radioactive heavy metals fig 4 shows the schematic of several radioactive heavy metals removed by mxene 157 shahzad et al 151 fabricated ti3c2tx mxene nanosheets to remove copper from water solutions their results showed that ti3c2tx mxene could remove copper due to unique functional features hydrophilicity excellent surface area and dispersibility the proposed mechanism for copper removal was determined by contributing functional ionic active groups o oh f on the surface of mxene as possible sites to absorb heavy metals ions guo et al 153 showed that 2d alkalization mxene could remove heavy metal ions effectively in aqueous media by providing sufficient pairs of opposite spin electrons to adsorb heavy metal ions due to the formation of the hydrogen traps feng et al 155 have also developed 2d alkalization mxene ldh adsorber by hydrothermal route to degrade ni ions from the aqueous media their findings exhibited that the possible mechanism for degradation of ni ii is chemical absorption fu et al 158 removed hg2 ions from water solution using ti3c2ox mxene by catalyst reduction or adsorption reduction redox reaction mechanism based on their proposed mechanism the edge of 001 ti plays a major role in the removal of hg2 ions the terminated 001 face of ti on the edge of mxene nanosheets microstructures functionalizes and acts as both an efficient adsorption site for hg2 ions capture and active catalytic sites for hg2 ions reduction resulting in ultra rapid removal of hg2 ions the catalyst reduction or adsorption reduction mechanism of alkalization mxene ldh has been represented in fig 5 158 water organic pollutants e g cationic and anionic dyes critically threaten the food ecosystem stability agricultural products and human health due to high toxicity and so hard to remove these pollutants the degradation mechanism of organic pollutants is mainly photocatalyst and biodegradation the absorption mechanism could not decompose the organic pollutants well and will be disposed to secondary contaminations 159 161 the photocatalytic degradations have been significantly improved by using mxene and mxene based materials to decrease the water pollutants 160 162 in a study a derived mxene nanohybrid as bifeo3 ti3c2 was fabricated to increase photocatalytic activity for degrading organic dyes and colorless pollutants the results indicated that due to the high surface area of nanohybrid the electron hole pairs produced with irradiating of visible light combined with o2 electrons and oh holes to create superoxide free hydroxyl radicals based on this mechanism photocatalytic degradation is found to be 100 efficient for congo red and acetophenone as an organic dye and colorless aqueous pollutants respectively 163 cui et al 162 loaded bi2wo6 on nb2ctx mxene nanosheets through an easy hydrothermal process to focus on the degradation of selected dyes rhodamine b methylene blue and tetracycline hydrochloride in aqueous media the hybrid nanosheets combined with high special surface area showed significantly enhanced photodegradation performance the photodegradation exhibited excellent efficiency for methylene blue 92 7 rhodamine b 99 8 and tetracycline hydrochloride 83 1 respectively the remarkably photocatalytic mechanism of nanohybrid is due to the construction intimated interaction between nb2ctx and bi2wo6 under the irradiation of visible light the photo generated electrons are produced by exciting nanosheets the photo generated electrons are accumulated on the bi2wo6 conduction band and transferred to the nb2ctx conduction band as a result nb2ctx could be acted as an electron capture trap in addition a schottky barrier is created at the nanohybrid interface that suppressed the recombination of photo generated electron hole pairs and led to improve the photocatalytic performance of nanohybrid other mxene based compounds are used in the degradation of organic pollutants in aqueous media the proposed mechanism of photodegradation of hybrid nanosheets has been shown in fig 6 generally the degradation mechanism is based on photocatalytic activity by producing free radicals 159 162 164 165 the conjugated compound of bi2s3 ti3c2tx intensely reduced the amount of staphylococcus aureus 99 86 and escherichia coli 99 92 in only 10 min 166 moreover methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa could also be efficiently eliminated 99 using ti3c2tx mxene polydopamine mxene pda 167 zheng et al 168 synthesized multifunctional mxene ceo2 nanocomposites by combining ti3c2tx mxenes and antioxidant ceo2 this compound can be effectively used against a wide range of multidrug resistant mdr bacterial pathogens in another report he et al 12 169 synthesized the monolayer tivctx which showed a high bactericidal potential against e coli and b subtilis a gram positive spore forming bacteria interestingly wu et al 170 established a fast easy to handle and broad spectrum antibacterial method using a combination of mxene and light 808 nm ti3c2 mxenes in the presence of light showed remarkable antibacterial influence on different isolates of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa vancomycin resistant enterococci vre and even mrsa biofilms in another work mansoorianfar et al 20 the mxene nanofragments ti3c2 nanosheets tightly bound to bacteriophages for modification of bacteriophage surface by fe2 fe3 ions that remarkably improved the antibacterial performance the high toxicity of bacterial at the fe modified ti3c2 nanosheets was attributed to the reduced edges of ti3c2 nanofragments which provided intense interaction sharp edges and oxidative stress with bacteria they showed that the mxene functionalized bacteriophages could be more effective against bacteria even in concentrations lower than mxene s mic since the conjugated aptamer has greater specificity for recognizing and targeting host receptors besides mxene nanofragments are driven to interact positively with bacteria due to the positive induced surface moieties their proposed mechanisms were the bacteriophage s specific targeting capability often by bursting out and lysing of the host and the interaction between mxene and bacterial cell which cause to rupture of the bacterial cell wall they also concluded that in aquatic environments during the long standing cultivation both stability and adsorption rate of bacteriophage significantly increased with ti3c2 mxene offering superior antibacterial activity against bacterial cells the mxene laden bacteriophage took up and attached to host bacteria quickly effectively and reduced 99 99 of deliberately added contaminations in water samples interestingly to note no regrowth of the target bacteria occurred after infection with the ti3c2 mxene bacteriophage during the experiment period and the number of bacteria stayed constantly lower than the detection threshold 20 4 magnetic mxene based nanocomposites for water treatment the advantages and disadvantages of mxene and magnetic materials in removing water pollutants and the governing mechanisms were discussed in detail in previous sections despite the specific benefits of magnetic materials due to the intrinsic properties of magnetic nanoparticles and consequently magnetic interactions between nanoparticles they are prone to accumulation and agglomeration therefore the ability and efficiency of magnetic nanoparticles for water treatment may be relatively reduced 33 although mxene also has good properties for removing hazardous contaminants in aqueous media however mxene has relative toxicity and also tends to agglomerate and oxidize on the other hand due to the intrinsic properties of mxene such as high colloidal ability its separation in aqueous media is too difficult also the large size of the mxene molecules act as a barrier to electron transfer at the interface and it is almost impossible to create a perfect contact surface for transferring electron in the interface however all of the above has been affected by the use of mxene its performance and its applications although both magnetic materials and mxene have shown excellent properties for water treatment especially when it comes to the removal of heavy metals ions and environmental remediation surface functionalization of mxene and magnetic nanoparticles are essential to improve their applications and minimize their disadvantages while increasing their efficiency and avoiding wasting time energy and costs therefore surface functionalization of mxene materials and magnetic nanoparticles have been rapidly developing as effective metal oxide nanocomposites to remove various water contaminants such as heavy metals and organic pollutants 171 174 fe2o3 nanoparticles are widely investigated as water treatment and therapy mediators due to their significant magnetic moments 134 135 137 138 163 173 175 hybrid fe2o3 ti3c2tx magnetic mxene mgmx nanocomposites were fabricated by hydrothermal technique as a purifier for removal of hg2 ions as most toxic heavy metals mg2 ca2 na and k ions as background metals from aqueous media the metal ions concentration decreased by using mgmx as an adsorber so that the concentration of hg2 ions reached from 2 29 to 0 02 mg 1 this study revealed that the mgmx nanocomposites have a great potential in removing hg2 ions due to the existence of excessive anion groups like o2 and oh and other negative surface charges 173 in another study 176 a unique mxene magnetic sandwich structure nanocomposite aroused tremendous enthusiasm for the efficient separation of phosphate from water resources the ultrafine magnetic nanoparticles nano fe2o3 embed into the interior layers of mxene to increase the number of available ti oh active layers and widen the distance between the layers while the intercalator magnetic nanoparticles nano fe3o4 as exterior surface endowed the easy separation it also ensured and guaranteed the excellent selective absorption of phosphate with high efficiency and fast kinetics due to the stimulated surface of the two dimensional ti oh terminated layered within mxene and fe oh exchanged sites of ferric oxide intercalation this mechanism and the nanocomposite synthesis method are shown in fig 7 176 yang et al 177 2d mxene nanosheets ti3c2tx and various amounts of self assembly magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 decorated on the surface of cellulose acetate membrane as nanofiltration for removal heavy metal ions cu2 cd2 and cr6 from wastewater the efficiency of this nanocomposite was compared with pure mxene nanosheets to remove these cationic contaminants the obtained results showed that the removal ratio values of cu2 cd2 and cr6 increased for magnetic mxene nanocomposite compared to pure mxene from 29 7 to 63 2 for cu2 30 7 to 64 1 for cd2 and 32 8 to 70 2 for cr6 on the other hand the removal percentages of heavy metal ions also increased with increasing magnetic phase contents a plausible mechanism for magnetic mxene nanofiltrations was proposed based on the mass transfer between neighbor mxene nanosheets oh groups on mxene surface which help create absorption sites for heavy metal pollutants generally because of excellent properties such as excessive surface area recyclability high hydrophilicity phase stability in aqueous media and a good performance against contaminations magnetic mxene nanocomposites are remarkably good candidates when it comes to the elimination of metal ions from water media 173 176 178 more organic pollutants such as hazardous refractory contaminations and dyes are nowadays widely discharged to water resources due to increasing population and global industrialization many organic pollutants are often toxic and harmful to the ecological system and also humans animals and plants 43 171 178 181 alkaline hydrothermal treatment as a one step strategy was used to load fe3o4 on ti3c2 mxene to remove organic dyes including methyl orange rhodamine b methylene blue and congo red cui et al 178 they concluded that free radical groups consisting of superoxide o2 and hydroperoxyl radicals oh have a crucial task in the photodegradation process of organic dyes in aqueous media in another report 43 magnetic mxene nanocomposite α fe2o3 znfe2o4 ti3c2 was synthesized with a similar methodology to simultaneously remove organic pollutants and cr6 as a heavy metal ion with a visible light assistant the presence of magnetic and mxene phases increases conductivity at the heterostructure interface and enhances the absorption of visible light therefore degradation ability and photocatalytic properties could be extraordinarily increased zhang et al 181 anchored two dimensional α fe2o3 nanosheets on the layers of ti3c2 mxene through a self assembly method assisted by facile ultrasonic for photodegradation of rhodamine b the organic dye degradation rate obtained more than 90 and the proposed mechanism included charges transfer on the ɑ fe2o3 ti3c2 intimate nanocomposite interfaces increasing drug resistance is now a critical worldwide concern threatening public health hygiene 182 186 eco friendly substances are promising alternatives for the present antimicrobial agents nife2o4 mxene heterostructure as eco friendly magnetic mxene nanocomposite was fabricated by rasheed et al 179 to enhance photocatalytic degradation activity and antibacterial performance and compared to individual mxene and nife2o4 nanosheets in wastewater media they concluded that sheet to sheet bonding provides an appreciable opportunity for superior degradation of wastewater pollutants and antibacterial activity furthermore the heterostructure nanocomposite represented outstanding antibacterial activity against gram negative e coli bacteria while the degradation mechanism of methylene blue has been explained via degradation kinetic study of process fig 8 demonstrated the possible mechanism of photodegradation methylene blue dye in the presence of nife2o4 mxene nano photocatalyst 179 other studies have been done on the effect of magnetic mxene nanocomposites on the degradation of antibiotics in wastewater media 33 39 40 187 iron based nanoscale mxene nzvi ti3c2 nanosheets were prepared by in situ reductive precipitation path and identified as an outstanding fenton like catalyst for degradation of ranitidine this study indicated that the iron based nanoscale mxene nanocomposite could well degrade ranitidine the proposed mechanism for degradation ranitidine includes five steps 1 antibiotic molecule diffuses and adsorb on the surface of nzvi ti3c2 nanosheets 2 the nzvi particles are subject to oxidation corrosion 3 cyclic transformation occurs fe3 iii fe2 fe activates 4 h2o2 molecule 5 hydroxyl radicals react with the antibiotic fig 9 represents the details of the possible mechanism for degradation of ranitidine by nanocomposite z table 1 summarizes the degradation properties of heavy metals ions organic pollutants bacteria and antibiotics by magnetic mxene nanocomposites in various water media 5 future prospects and conclusions several desirable properties of mxenes make them suitable for environmental remediation such as hydrophilicity absorbable soluble in water nontoxicity activated metallic hydroxide sites antimicrobial agents and high surface area the mxene compounds are not only discussed for applications in water treatment researchers also try to address how they could be useful in other approaches of photocatalysts sensors emi shields the new generation of antibacterial materials and anti biofouling compounds to the best of our knowledge presently there are three main types of mxene applications associated with water treatment membranes adsorbents and electrode materials as well as discussing toxicity and environmental impact the researchers note that despite previous studies showing biocompatibility and nonacute toxicity of mxenes recent studies have found mxene is capable to cause cytoplasmic membrane destruction by passing through bacterial membranes potentially disturbing the prokaryotic cells function which could eventually result in bacteria death in this review the wide range of applications of magnetic mxene in water purification methods and a comprehensive application of mxene for water and wastewater treatment have been demonstrated the enormous studies about mxene have provided a clear perspective based on an understanding of mxene and how mxene is different from the spinel ferrite recently used for water and wastewater treatment in addition to conventional magnetic materials the use of magnetic materials such as hexagonal ferrites and other environmentally friendly magnetic materials in the form of magnetic mxene based nanocomposites can be considered for future works the future of mxene and magnetic mxene nanocomposites in pollution removal has raised attention in proposing many novel compounds to be synthesized through simple one step techniques devoid of shortcomings of present nanomaterials especially as photothermal membrane distillation filtering and antibacterial membranes in the case of the antibacterial property of both magnetic nanoparticles and mxene the induced positive surface moieties drive magnetic mxene nanocomposites toward the negative surface charge of bacteria with the primary mechanism of physical interaction with the bacterial cell membrane which may rupture the cell wall also in photothermal membrane distillation irradiation by the laser causes surface plasmon activation generating random dipoles and resonance and finally light heat conversion which is the primary reason for magnetic mxene nanosheets to show photothermal performance for pollution removal finally it is essential to accurately detail all methods of water purifications by mxene material this review aimed to provide an update on the last progress in the field and discussed the concept of using magnetic mxene nanocomposites for contaminants removal from water the proposed highlights in the present study would be helpful for future trends on mxene s and magnetic mxene nanomaterials for water treatment and

13017,chlorpyrifos cpf is a human hazardous insecticide regularly found in surface and ground water due its wide use and can greatly endanger human health and aquatic ecosystems hence developing green low cost and effective adsorbents is urgently needed for cpf removal from contaminated water in this study novel nanostructured activated biochar based pomegranate peels nabpp was developed characterized and assessed for its capability in cpf removal from wastewater langmuir and first order models best described adsorption equilibrium and kinetics data respectively the maximum adsorption

remediating cpf contaminated water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption mechanisms kinetics pomegranate peels chlorpyrifos low cost 1 introduction chlorpyrifos cpf is a worldwide recognized insecticide mostly used for protection of many economically crops and ornamental plants against a diverse range of pests and mites 1 2 because cpf is highly toxic to human and animals and extensively used its residues widely spread in the environment and greatly endanger human animals and environment health therefore developing an efficient and inexpensive method to eliminate the cpf residues is critically needed for protection of our health and surrounding environment 3 adsorption plays a significant role in the environmental pollution control where the adsorption process is one of the extensively applied techniques for organic pollutant removal from wastewater the considerably applied adsorbents in adsorption processes are nanomaterials 4 6 activated carbon 7 the fe3o4 magnetic activated carbon nanocomposite 8 and membrane composed of metal organic framework 9 due to their remarkable effectiveness for removal of organics from wastewater but their commercial application is costly in recent years the use of agro industrial wastes as carbon precursors has received much attention from the scientific community due to its diverse advantages such as low cost renewable resource high specific surface area abundant functional groups adequate porosity and high surface reactivity 10 11 the peels of pomegranate punica granatum l agro waste of the fruit juice processing industry have been successfully utilized as inexpensive adsorbent for elimination of water contaminants particularly toxic elements and dyes 12 14 however literature is not available on performance of pomegranate peels biochar for pesticides removal from contaminated water additionally it is well proven that active carbons largely outperform agricultural waste materials in specific surface area functional groups of the surface and number of microporous 15 therefore the goal of this study was to enhance the elimination of cpf from real waste water for the first time using the innovative nanostructured activated biochar derived from punica granatum peels the specific objectives of the current study were to 1 develop produce characterize and assess a novel nanostructured activated biochar derived from punica granatum peels nppab for its effectiveness in elimination of cpf from real waste water 2 conduct a series of comprehensive sorption studies to determine the ideal

the muffle furnace for 2 h at 800 c in a cylindrical steel reactor after cooling the final outcome was filtrated and rinsed several times with distilled water till neutral ph was reached 16 after that dried at 110 c for 2 h and finally stored in tightly closed bottles fig 1 the planetary ball mill was then used to reduce the size particles to 100 nm following the approach of elkhatib et al 17 the

distribution in the nppab before and after cpf sorption were studied using sem combined with edx su8010 hitachi the xrd patterns were executed using pro diffractometer panalytical b v the scanned range of 2θ from 10 to 90 with a 2 min rate the xrd analysis of nppab is presented in supplementary information fig s2 the sem was performed on nppab adsorbent material before and after cpf adsorption fig 2a shows porous structure with an irregular external surface full of cavities for the nppab in addition the particles are almost spherical with varying sizes in the range of 22 30 nm the sem image of nppab loaded with cpf fig 2b reveals a covering layer of cpf adsorbed on the nppab surface and different expansion of the pore size distribution the edx analysis is used to specify the type of elements and their relative ratios in the sorbents the edx elemental analysis of nppab presented in fig 2c shows high percentages of carbon 75 32 oxygen 17 78 and phosphorus 6 63 and significantly lower percentage of ca 0 26 whereas the edx elemental analysis of cpf loaded nppab show an increase in carbon content 81 14 and decrease in o 13 68 p 5 04 and ca 0 11 contents relative to that of unloaded nppab the increase of c and fluorine 0 85 contents in cpf loaded nppab in comparison to those of unloaded nppab affirm cpf sorption by nppab fig 2d the bet specific surface area ssa of nppab sample revealed that the specific surface area ssa of nppab 1149 62 m2g 1 is 138 times higher than that of bpp 8 30 m2g 1 which makes it an excellent applicant for remediation of contaminated water 3 2 surface functional groups of nppab the ftir spectroscopy was employed to identify the active function groups of the molecular compounds studied within wavenumber range of 4000 350 cm 1 20 the active function groups of nppab and cpf loaded nppab sorbents are presented in fig 2e a sharp and intense band corresponds to oh stretching vibration at 3698 cm 1 is noticed in the ftir spectra of nppab samples before cpf adsorption 21 fig 2e lower the presence of broad band at 2915 cm 1 is referred to ch bond of stretch vibration of ch2 alkane and other functional groups of the series chn 22 the peak around 1571 cm 1 is refereed to stretching vibration of cc bond of aromatic rings 23 the band at 1108 cm 1 represents po in acid phosphate esters 24 whereas the peak around 1033 915 cm 1 can be assigned to co stretching in phenols alcohols or esters 25 the bands at 699 429 cm 1 are referred to the carboxylate alkane secondary cyclic alcohol and alkene groups 13 26 in the spectra of cpf loaded nppab the peak at 2915 cm 1 was disappeared and two new peaks attributed to oh group and cn bending vibration were appeared at 3421 cm 1 and 2077 cm 1 respectively 27 28 fig 2e upper additionally the two peaks at 1571 cm 1 and 1108 cm 1 were little shifted to newly wave numbers 1574 cm 1 and 1162 cm 1 respectively fig 2e upper furthermore the shifted bands became more noticeable which suggest interactions of cpf molecules with the functional groups of nppab the ftir spectrum of cpf unloaded nppab indicates the abundance of carboxylic alkenes and hydroxyl groups in the external surface of nppab which could be bind through adsorption to the cpf molecules 3 3 optimizing cpf adsorption by nppab time of adsorption is a crucial criterion of the adsorption phenomena the influence of various contact times 10 to 1440 min at initial concentration of 25 μg ml 1 on cpf removal percentage by nppab sorbent was investigated fig 3a the cpf removal percentage by nppab reached 89 6 during the first 10 min and slightly increased to 96 at 90 min for additional investigations the optimum contact time of 90 min was selected for efficient cpf removal the adsorption capacity of nppab as influenced by different initial cpf concentrations 10 120 μg ml 1 was examined the experimental results fig 3b show increases in the nppab adsorption capacity with increases in cpf initial concentrations due to driving force enhancement that allows the passage of extra cpf molecules from the solution to the adsorbent surface fig 3b 29 the solution ph effects on cpf adsorption by nppab were examined and presented in fig 3c the results revealed gradual increases in nppab sorption capacity with increasing ph values from 5 to 7 with maximum sorption capacity attained at ph 7 95 removal in contrary at ph values 7 9 the cpf removal percentage decreased from 95 to 90 due to the repulsive behavior of excess oh anions and oh function group of nppab fig 3c the effect of nppab adsorbent dosages 0 05 0 5 g was investigated using standard cpf solution of 25 μg ml 1 and normal ph increasing adsorbent dosage from 0 1 g to 0 5 g sharply decreased nppab sorption capacity sc from 95 to 90 fig 3d because of cpf particles agglomeration at higher cpf concentration 30 3 4 modelling adsorption kinetics the rate of contaminant transfer from sorbate onto sorbents greatly affects the removal enactment in the current study the obtained experimental kinetics data were modeled by four kinetic models first order elovich power function and parabolic diffusion to identify the precise model capable of reproducing the results 18 table 1 presents the four kinetic models tested and their parameters the experimental kinetics data of cpf adsorption onto the sorbents studied are well described by the first order model followed by power function model based on the high r2 and low se values of these models table 1 and fig 4a moreover the rate of cpf adsorption ka obtained from first order model for nppab ascertained much faster sorption rate in nano ppab in comparison to that of bulk pp which allows higher cpf loading on the surface of ppab nanoparticles in shorter time period table 1 3 5 adsorption equilibrium study adsorption isotherms were used to describe the retention of sorbate cpf on the pp and nppab sorbents studied to explain the adsorbent adsorbate interactions and to express the affinity of sorbents at equilibrium 18 the adsorption equilibrium data were fitted to 6 adsorption isotherm models the 6 tested adsorption models along with their parameters are displayed in table 1 the adsorption data best fitted to langmuir isotherm with very low standard error se of 0 00018 and 0 00011 for bpp and nppab sorbents respectively table 1 and fig 4b the excellent fit of langmuir adsorption isotherm model proposes monolayer adsorption of cpf on the surface of bpp and nppab sorbents 31 the langmuir qmax adsorption capacity of nppab for cpf was estimated to be 100 mg g which is 25 times greater than that of bulk pp table 4 lists the comparison of the maximum adsorption capacity of nppab for organo phosphorus pesticides opps including cpf with various adsorbents recently reported in the literature 2014 2020 it is quite apparent that the maximum adsorption capacity of the modified nppab is fairly high and extraordinary worthier than all of the sorbents recorded in table 4 thus ppab nanoparticles have been evidently demonstrated to be a superior competitor for elimination of cpf from contaminated water 3 6 sorption thermodynamics the sorption thermodynamics of cpf onto nppab was investigated at 3 different temperatures for 2 initial concentrations table 3 presents the calculated thermodynamic parameters for cpf adsorption onto nppab the negativity of δg values for cpf adsorption suggests the spontaneity and thermodynamic favorability of the sorption process however the negative δg values decreased with increasing the temperatures indicating less efficient adsorption of cpf onto nppab at elevated temperatures table 3 and fig 5 18 similarly the δh values are negative pointing out that the cpf adsorption possess is exothermic and it is therefore sustained by the decrease of cpf sorption by nppab with temperature increase the δso values of cpf adsorption by nppab at solution concentrations of 25 and 80 μg cpf ml 1were 0 0 0391 and 0 0263 kjmol 1 k 1 respectively the positive values of δs suggests that cpf sorption process on nppab have caused entropy increase and the arrangement of cpf molecules at solid solution interface is more random similar trends were revealed by several researchers 32 33 3 7 the plausible interaction mechanisms between cpf and nppab sorbent the maximum cpf percent removal by nppab occurred at ph 7 and deceased at ph 7 5 and ph 7 9 fig 3c the phpzc of nppac adsorbent is 2 82 as shown in fig 3e the adsorbent surface charge is positive at ph phpzc and negative at ph phpzc 34 therefore at solution ph higher than 2 82 the nppab possess negative charges and the positively charged ions cpf becomes more accessible and reach the maximum at ph 7 at alkaline conditions ph 7 the nppab is negatively charged and the competition between the oh active groups of cpf and the surplus oh in the solution may limit cpf removal fig 3c such actions reveal the significance of the electrostatic interactions in the cpf adsorption mechanism onto nppab the suggested cpf adsorption mechanisms onto nppab sorbent fig 6 based on the ftir and sorption results are h bond 1 because cpf comprises s o and n anions h donors while nppab accommodates oh functional groups h acceptor it is feasible that h bond could take place at ph 7 the shift of the two new peaks assigned to oh group and the vanishing band at 2915 cm 1 ch bond as indicating in ftir analyses fig 2e upper might confirm the existence of h bonding in the course of the cpf adsorption process electrostatic interactions 2 the strong affinity of the oh ch co and cn function groups of nppab for anionic species of cpf s o n and cl strongly suggests the participation of electrostatic interactions in the cpf adsorption process π π interaction 3 the oh ch and co groups on nppab surface may act as π electron donor and the π electron cloud in benzene ring of cpf may serve as electron acceptor fig 6 hydrophobic interaction 4 cpf molecules tended to moderately aggregate into the nppab organic fractions in water solution due to the hydrophobicity moderate level of cpf kow value 4 7 5 3 at optimal neutral ph the solubility of the cpf anionic groups decrease remarkably and the hydrophobic mechanism predominate over electrostatic interactions 35 3 8 removal of cpf from real wastewater and nppab reusability a series of adsorption desorption tests were executed under optimum conditions to evaluate the stability of adsorbed cpf onto nppab the results of the repetitive adsorption desorption experiments fig 7a revealed 81 27 removal of cpf after 5 adsorption cycles which pinpoints the stability of the cpf sorbed by nppab the nppab efficiency for cpf removal from distilled water spiked with cpf were 96 31 and 94 39 in batch and packed bed reactor respectively slight decrease in cpf removal percentages were achieved using the contaminated wastewater 89 94 and 84 74 in comparison to cpf spiked distilled water due to the more heterogeneous matrices of real wastewater fig 7b 4 conclusions the nanostructured activated biochar nppab efficiently removed 89 94 and 84 74 of chlorpyrifos cpf from real wastewater in batch and column techniques respectively the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity qmax of cpf onto nppab was quite high 100 mg g the nppab removal efficiency for cpf reached 81 27 after 5 adsorption cycles hydrophobicity hydrogen bond electrostatic and π π interactions were the main cpf sorption mechanisms onto nppab the efficient use of nppab up to five cycles ascertained its stability high

effluent treatment active chlorine antibiotic 1 introduction the occurrence of emerging contaminants in wastewater and the environment has been the subject of many studies as they pose serious threats to the ecosystem and human health 1 4 among emerging contaminants pharmaceutical compounds such as antibiotics have drawn considerable attention due to the presence of antibacterial drugs in the environment inducing the proliferation of bacterial resistance to drugs 2 5 8 low concentrations of antibiotics are found in industrial and hospital effluents 100 500 mg l and in urban wastewater 3 9 10 being discharged into the environment through the excreta of humans and animals or through the inappropriate disposal of expired formulations 11 one of the most prescribed antibiotic in the world is ciprofloxacin cip 12 13 after administering a dose of cip a percentage of the dose is excreted unaltered 15 50 and as metabolites 10 15 in urine within 24 h 14 cip is among the top ten emerging high priority contaminants and its presence in wastewater and surface water even in low concentration is considered an environmental risk 13 15 cip is persistent in the environment and can induce selection of microbial populations generating bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics 16 therefore finding an effective way to remove it from wastewater is of paramount importance the appearance of emerging contaminants in the environment has demonstrated the inefficiency of conventional methods such as biological processes sedimentation filtration coagulation and flocculation used in wastewater treatment plants to remove these contaminants 8 several technologies have been developed as options for treating wastewater containing cip such as ozonation 17 and membrane separation 18 however these technologies are costly and difficult to apply industrially among these technologies advanced oxidation processes aop are an alternative for the degradation of this contaminant due to the high oxidation rates obtained 19 20 however some aops require the handling of hazardous chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide in fenton reactions 21 22 on the other hand electrochemical treatment is based on the in situ production of highly oxidizing species to promote the mineralization of contaminants 19 23 24 regarding the operational costs necessary to perform some aop such as electrochemical oxidation fenton and ozonation 25 the electrochemical treatment has been shown to be less expensive than the ozonation process in addition although the fenton technology generally has a lower investment cost compared to electrooxidation the accumulation of oxidation refractory compounds in fenton process makes it necessary to use additional treatments and can significantly increase the cost of operating the process moreover the electrode material used strongly influences the efficiency of the electrochemical process 25 dimensionally stable anodes dsa especially composed of a tio2 ruo2 mixture have proven to be valuable for the environmental electrochemical community which have been applied as electrodes for degradation of organic contaminants 23 26 28 because they present high stability under extreme electrolysis conditions commercial availability and relatively low manufacturing costs 29 30 in addition under specific ph conditions and in a chloride containing medium another characteristic of dsa electrodes is the ease of formation of oxidizing active chlorine species acs dissolved cl2 hocl and or ocl that can considerably increase the rate of organic removal 31 32 the action of acs depends on the ph of the solution where cl2 is predominant at ph 3 0 ocl at ph 8 0 and hocl in the ph range between 3 0 and 8 0 being hocl and ocl produced through the electrochemical formation of cl2 from cl and subsequent dissolution of cl2 in aqueous medium eqs 1 2 and 3 33 34 therefore the electrochemical oxidation of organic contaminants in a chloride containing medium must be faster at ph 8 0 since the standard potential values of cl2 e 1 36 v she and hocl e 1 49 v she are higher than that of clo e 0 89 v she 1 2 cl cl 2 aq 2 e 2 cl 2 aq h 2 o hocl cl h 3 hocl ocl h pk a 7 5 the use of nacl as a supporting electrolyte is interesting in view of it being a low cost reagent and due to the in situ production of acs which are strong oxidizing agents 35 however in many studies na2so4 is chosen as a supporting electrolyte in electrochemical processes 36 39 even though it has a lower removal rate than nacl 40 since there is a lesser chance of generating toxic organochlorine species and other such as clo2 clo3 and clo4 41 that can significantly increase the toxicity of treated effluents however some studies in the literature indicate that the combination of the electrochemical process with simultaneous ultraviolet irradiation can reduce toxicity and organochlorine production 42 43 in addition acs can undergo photolysis mediated by uv radiation and generate highly reactive photo oxidants such as ho and cl eqs 4 5 and 6 16 this fact transforms a common electrochemical process into an aop 4 hocl hv ho cl 5 ocl h 2 o hv ho ho cl 6 cl 2 hv 2 cl although photo assisted electrochemical wastewater treatment has been extensively studied 36 37 39 44 49 there are few studies that investigate the possibility of reducing the toxicity of the treated solution when nacl is used as supporting electrolyte by the photo assisted electrochemical coupled technique compared to the isolated electrochemical technique 42 43 based on these issues the present study aimed to investigate the performance of the photo assisted electrochemical paec process in the degradation of the cip antibiotic using dsa anode and nacl as supporting electrolyte the effect of the experimental variables current density nacl concentration volumetric flow and initial ph was evaluated on the degradation of cip and the production of acs the process kinetics were evaluated by adjusting the pseudo first order nonlinear model to the kinetic data the best condition obtained was used to evaluate the mineralization process through analysis of chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc experiments with isolated processes electrochemical and photochemical were performed for comparative purposes with the paec process in addition phytotoxicity tests were performed on the solutions treated by the processes that employ electrolysis to assess the acute toxicity of the solution containing the cip antibiotic although cip is one of the most consumed antibiotics in the world and a contaminant of emerging concern studies involving its removal by the photo assisted electrochemical technique are scarce in the literature even if cip was previously treated by a photo assisted electrochemical process in a chloride containing medium to produce radicals with higher oxidation potentials compared to the original active chlorine 47 the toxicity of the treated solution was not evaluated therefore the main focus of this work is to evaluate the photo assisted electrochemical coupled technique and demonstrate that it is possible to use nacl as a supporting electrolyte to improve the degradation mineralization of the cip contaminant and at the same time benefit the toxicity of the treated solution when compared to the purely electrochemical technique which demonstrates the relevance of this article 2 experimental 2 1 pharmaceutical contaminant synthetic solutions of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride cip 1 mmol l ems pharmaceuticals brazil 99 9

photochemical were performed for comparative purposes with the paec process 2 4 kinetic modeling in electrochemical oxidation processes the degradation of organic compounds at low concentrations generally obeys pseudo first order kinetics 33 42 48 50 therefore nonlinear kinetic model of pseudo first order eq 7 was employed in experimental data the quality of the fit of the model to the data

organism lactuca sativa lettuce 55 which was kept as seed until the test was conducted to assess the possible generation of toxic compounds during degradation the germination method of the test organism lactuca sativa is an excellent tool for bioassays of effluent toxicity since it has high sensitivity to chemical stress rapid germination easy cultivation low cost reproducibility and simple operation in addition the tests indicate the possibility of reusing treated effluent for plant irrigation 56 briefly ten seeds were placed on a filter paper soaked in 2 ml of sample inside a petri dish the plates were covered and sealed with film paper to avoid evaporation losses ultrapure reverse osmosis water os20lxe gehaka was used in the control experiments the seeds were incubated for 120

diffraction xrd patterns for the dsa electrode composed of ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 and the ti counter electrode obtained commercially at the ti cathode large peaks associated with metallic ti jcpds 04 316 were observed at 2θ 53 40 and 28 attributed to 0 1 2 0 1 1 and 0 0 2 reflection planes respectively the analysis performed to identify the crystalline phases of the dsa electrode revealed the presence of tio2 jcpds 00 9161 and ruo2 jcpds 05 1159 attributed to 1 1 0 at 2θ 28 0 1 1 at 2θ 35 and 1 2 1 at 2θ 54 reflection planes the presence of metallic ti was also detected due to the support substrate tio2 and ruo2 crystallize in the same tetragonal crystalline structure and have a rutile structure which according to the hume rothery theory this mixed metal oxides can form a solid solution where ti4 and ru4 share the same location in the sub cationic network of a tetragonal phase 28 58 59 since the ionic radius of ti4 0 075 nm and ru4 0 076 nm are similar ruo2 oxide grows in a tio2 rutile layer previously formed on the ti substrate the tio2 layer can guide the growth of ruo2 in the tetragonal structure favored by the similarity in its network parameters sem micrograph analysis was performed to evaluate the electrode texture fig s2 in supplementary material the ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 dsa anode images show morphology with a characteristic of cracked mud fig s2 a in supplementary material typical of oxide films prepared by the thermal decomposition route these cracks are caused by thermal shocks during calcination 30 32 60 this type of morphology gives the electrodes a high surface area previous studies 60 compared the dsa electrode of nominal composition ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 obtained commercially with the prepared one in the laboratory and evaluated that the commercial electrode demonstrated to have a much larger internal area sem images for the ti based cathode fig s2 b in supplementary material show homogeneous morphology with some defects generated in the mechanical polishing process and typical characteristic of an amorphous surface moreover edx analysis of the electrodes confirms the majority presence of ti 99 8 in the ti cathode and of the elements ti o and ru 30 8 47 8 and 8 2 respectively in the dsa anode in addition the distribution of the mapping of the elements shows a good dispersion of each element along the surface of the electrodes fig s2 in supplementary material 3 2 cip degradation 3 2 1 effect of current density the effect of applied current density j was investigated at 14 3 60 7 and 107 1 ma cm2 the range of values of j investigated was chosen considering the limiting current density for the evolution of cl2 j lim 12 ma cm2 for the flux reactor see 19 estimated using a value of the mass transfer coefficient k m 2 07 10 6 m s obtained as described by cañizares et al 25 and perereita et al 61 see supplementary material by pereira et al 61 and the investigations of cyclic voltammetry of the electrode ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 in nacl performed by malpass et al 62 thus the limit anodic current density for the evolution of cl2 remained between approximately 2 and 12 ma cm2 considering that the cl concentration ranged from 0 1 to 0 6 mol l in the experiments evaluated here consequently as the investigated current density range 14 3 107 1 ma cm2 is greater than the limiting anodic current density j lim 12 ma cm2 the system is under mass transport control in which concerns the evolution of cl2 fig 2 a shows the decline in the concentration of cip during the photo assisted electrochemical treatment by the current densities j of 14 3 60 7 and 107 1 ma cm2 fig 2 a shows that cip removal increased from 73 to approximately 100 with an increase in j from 14 3 to 60 7 ma cm2 respectively after 10 min of degradation it is evident that the increase in current density reduced the degradation time of the cip from 20 min 14 3 ma cm2 to 5 min 60 7 ma cm2 and 3 min 107 1 ma cm2 it is worth noting that the cip degradation slowly decreased when the applied current density was greater than 60 7 ma cm2 implying that a higher current density 60 7 ma cm2 does not significantly accelerate the cip decay rate this behavior may have occurred because the evolution of o2 becomes the main reaction of the electrode when high values of current density are applied 8 and consequently decreases the production of oxidizing agents such as the ho and acs radicals generating lower current efficiency values as seen in fig 3 a similar behavior was observed in the electrochemical degradation of sulfamethoxazole by ti sno2 sb ce pbo2 anode 63 and of dimethyl phthalate ester by dsa anode 19 when high current density values are applied the electrochemical reactions tend to be controlled mainly by the mass transfer of the electrolyte while the simultaneous evolution of oxygen at the anode is the main factor that decreases the current efficiency 64 as seen in table 1 as j increased from 60 7 to 107 1 ma cm2 the kinetic constant k had an increase of about 4 times however although the value of the pseudo first order kinetic constant k increased slightly from 0 8 to 1 2 min 1 table 1 with an increase in current density from 60 7 to 107 1 ma cm2 energy consumption increased from 0 81 to 1 41 kwh cm3 since an excess current supply led to wasted energy the current density of 60 7 ma cm2 was ideal 3 2 2 effect of nacl concentration nacl was used as a support electrolyte in the electrooxidation of cip as seen in fig 2 b cip removal values of 99 0 0 6 mol l 99 4 0 3 mol l and 97 8 0 1 mol l were obtained after 5 min of electrooxidation the cip removal rate increased when the nacl concentration was 0 1 k 0 68 min 1 to 0 3 mol l k 0 82 min 1 table 1 this result demonstrated that the nacl concentration exhibited a slight effect on the removal of cip due to the formation of the produced acs eq 2 ph 5 however with the nacl concentration of 0 6 mol l k 0 86 min 1 there was no significant effect on the cip removal rate this behavior may be due to parasitic reactions of chlorine consumption and may form more recalcitrant compounds than the original compound generating less current efficiency values fig 3 b and therefore lower levels of sample mineralization would be achieved 65 the ee o value decreased from 1 47 to 0 83 kwh m3 as the nacl increased from 0 1 to 0 3 mol l table 1 however with the increase in nacl concentration to 0 6 mol l no significant decrease in energy consumption was observed thus it can be said that the concentration of nacl of 0 3 mol l provided a slight improvement in the rate of degradation of cip and in the consumption of energy therefore it was selected in the subsequent experiments 3 2 3 effect of volumetric flow volumetric flow q v is an important factor since the influence of q v in the process indicates whether the process is controlled by electron transfer or by mass transfer 35 fig 2 c and the k values table 1 show that the cip removal rate increased with increasing flow which may indicate that the process is limited by mass transport high q v values improve the transfer of electrolyte and organic species to the anode surface resulting in better degradation performance 11 studies in the literature of electrochemical degradation in a flow reactor of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin using an β pbo2 anode 11 and dye reactive orange 16 using a pt electrode 35 also obtained a rate of improved cip degradation with increased volumetric flow the elimination of cip can be considered rapid since cip removal values of 99 4 10 ml min 97 5 6 ml min and 85 5 2 ml min were obtained after only 5 min of electrooxidation in addition energy consumption was lower at the highest analyzed q v value 0 83 kwh m3 and increased approximately 2 7 times when q v decreased from 10 ml min to 2 ml min table 1 the best values of cip removal and energy savings were obtained for the highest q v value observed based on these results the flow rate used in the subsequent experiments was 10 ml min 3 2 4 effect of ph ph is an important factor in the electrooxidation process since it is related to the degradation of cip as it is a zwitterionic compound pk a1 6 1 and pk a2 8 7 where at ph above 8 7 cip has a negative charge in the carboxyl group and below ph 6 1 positive charge in the piperazine portion fig 3 c moreover the relative concentrations of hocl and ocl depend on the ph as it is a weak acid eq 3 and fig 3 c which influences photolysis of acs according to eqs 4 to 6 figs 2 d and 3 c show the effect of the initial ph on the degradation of cip after 10 min of degradation cip removal values of 88 2 ph 3 99 2 ph 5 82 8 ph 7 and 91 9 ph 10 fig 3 c were obtained the cip abatement at ph 7 obtained the lowest removal value 82 8 in relation to the other phs since the dissociation in ph between 6 5 and 8 5 is incomplete and the two species hocl and ocl are present in small concentrations 34 43 when the ph is reduced to 3 hocl and cl2 coexist in solution which influences the removal of cip 88 2 due to the formation of radicals resulting from the homolysis of acs eqs 4 and 6 in addition the difference in removal at ph 3 and 7 may have occurred due to the cip load in relation to ph where the principal cip species is zwitterionic at ph 7 and cationic at ph 3 fig 3 c which may have favored the electrostatic attraction due to the positive charge of the molecule at ph 3 generating a better removal result above ph 8 5 all hocl dissociates to the hypochlorous ion ocl and at ph between 3 5 and 6 5 there is no dissociation of hocl therefore removal of cip at ph 5 showed a better result 99 2 than at ph 10 91 9 since hocl has a greater germicidal effect than ocl 49 the highest k value was obtained at an initial ph of 5 0 82 min 1 and the lowest k was obtained at a ph of 7 0 24 min 1 suggesting an increase of approximately 3 4 times in the mass transfer coefficient in addition the lowest energy expenditure was obtained at ph 5 0 83 kwh m3 table 1 these results suggest that ph values between 3 5 and 6 5 favor rapid decay of cip once the highest hocl concentration values are produced under these conditions 47 the that with the use of ultraviolet irradiation enhances the production of ho a highly oxidative radical although the ph showed a slight difference in cip removal the removal rates were all over 90 after 15 min of electrooxidation these results suggest a broad ph range in the application of the photo assisted electrochemical process with dsa electrodes unlike some advanced oxidation processes such as the fenton process in which the production of ho is highly influenced by ph restricting the process to acidic ph 21 22 a possible explanation for this difference may be because the dsa electrodes have high activity regardless of the ph of the solution a similar result was obtained in the electrochemical degradation of cip by the bdd boron doped diamond anode 66 who observed that there is no need for deliberate adjustment in the ph value of the solution during the process 3 3 comparison with other electrodes the electrochemical oxidation tests are not directly compared due to the experimental conditions such as spacing between the electrodes volumetric flow current density temperature ph among others influencing the oxidation process of the organic compound table 2 compares the electrolysis times the pseudo first order kinetic constants k and the electrical efficiency per log order ee o obtained experimentally by cip electrooxidation under the best operating conditions obtained in this study with different anodes found in the literature wang et al 67 evaluated the electrochemical oxidation of cip using a sno2 sb ti anode and reported that higher initial cip concentration values inhibited the removal efficiency of cip degradation however for the system using dsa anode a high removal rate was obtained even with a cip concentration k 0 8 min 1 with c 0 368 mg l much higher than that evaluated by wang et al 67 k 0 046 min 1 with c 0 50 mg l the other studies that investigated the anodic oxidation of cip also obtained low values of reaction rate using the electrodes a gf k 0 033 min 1 b gf k 0 028 min 1 68 ti pt β pbo2 k 0 037 min 1 11 and ti sbruzr k 0 046 min 1 32 li et al 66 assessed the electrochemical degradation of cip at the bdd anode and obtained a relatively low ee o value of 1 47 kwh m3 however an ee o value of 1 78 times lower was obtained using the dsa anode which indicates superior characteristic of the dsa electrode of all the electrodes evaluated the dsa anode obtained the lowest result of energy consumption ee o and exhibited a reaction rate constant k comparatively higher than the other materials studied moreover the time required for cip electrolysis by the dsa anode was much shorter 5 min than with the other different anodes reported in the literature 20 120 min these results indicate that the dsa electrode has an excellent oxidation performance 3 4 mineralization performance under operating conditions of j 64 7 ma cm2 nacl 0 3 mol l q v 10 ml min and ph 5 a prolonged electrolysis was performed to assess the process mineralization the removal of toc and cod from the sample was significantly slower 16 h fig 4 a compared to the simple degradation of cip 5 min fig 2 as would be expected for a relatively large organic molecule c17h18fn3o3 initially sample mineralization was rapid and during the first hour of treatment by photo assisted electrochemical technology approximately 60 toc and 65 cod were removed however the mineralization rate decreased after 1 h of degradation with removal of 91 8 toc and 98 2 cod after 16 h fig 4 a this can be attributed to the formation of oxidation intermediates with greater resistance to attack by cl and ho radicals eqs 4 5 and 6 than the original compound cip 47 the evolution of mce and ec m kwh g during toc removal by the paec process with dsa anode is shown in fig 4 b the values of the mineralization current efficiency mce are high at the beginning 55 2 with 50 toc removed and decrease over the course of treatment 3 1 because of the reduction of organic matter and the o2 evolution reaction becomes the predominant process based on the literature the highest mce value is 9 2 times greater than the best one obtained from electrolysis of cip using a bdd electrode 6 in addition fig 4 b shows that the ec m increased from 0 16 to 1 9 kwh g obtaining lower values than found in the literature in the electrooxidation of cip by bdd anode 1 5 4 0 kwh g 6 indicating greater oxidation power of the dsa anode 3 5 comparison to isolated techniques literature studies have reported that the photo assisted electrochemical process can significantly increase the removal rate of organic species compared to individual techniques electrochemistry and photochemistry 26 fig 4 c shows that the processes that employ electrolysis ec and paec showed satisfactory toc removal values 80 while for the isolated photochemical pc process only about 6 toc removed after 10 h of treatment furthermore after 10 min of treatment it was possible to observe satisfactory removal of cip 98 by the paec and ec processes while the photochemical process was able to remove only about 24 of the drug fig s3 in supplementary material as reported by a previous study these results show that the removal of organic matter is directly related to the oxidizing species generated electrochemically in solution 23 26 electrochemical enhancement coefficient e can be quantified by eq 16 69 70 16 e k paec k ec k paec 100 where k paec and k ec are pseudo first order kinetic constants of cip degradation by paec and ec respectively the results showed that the coupling of electrochemical and photochemical techniques uvc 125 w resulted in a 10 8 increase in effects table 3 for cip degradation since the techniques showed additive effects in this study the synergy coefficient could be calculated see 69 70 however as the degradation of cip by the purely photochemical process pc did not present a good fit by the pseudo first order model table 3 the calculation of the synergistic effect s was performed based on the extent of mineralization of the techniques coupled according to eq 17 71 72 the positive value of s means that the individual processes support each other 17 s x c x i 1 100 where x c is the percentage of toc removal by the coupled techniques and x i is the sum of the percentages of toc removal by the isolated techniques a positive synergistic effect of 7 1 was obtained using eq 17 for the coupled techniques paec table 3 in this way the paec oxidation proved to be more efficient compared to the individual processes this is probably due to the formation of ho during the use of uv radiation on the surface of tio2 together with the electrochemical oxidation mechanism of cip that happens in the places where ruo2 is present in the anode 29 48 73 it was verified fig 4 c that the anodic process irradiated by ultraviolet light paec favored mineralization reactions cip mineralization by the pc process alone was around 0 6 and by the ec process around 56 in 1 h while the combined paec techniques provide 60 mineralization in 1 h in the ideal condition of j 64 7 ma cm2 nacl 0 3 mol l q v 10 ml min and ph 5 in the purely electrochemical process the main active chlorine species present in the would be hocl ph 5 however with simultaneous uv radiation and electrooxidation acs undergo photolysis and generate highly reactive photo oxidants such as ho and cl 16 3 6 phytotoxicity residual toxicity of the effluent is an important parameter to be investigated when it comes to complex effluents in addition it is known that the use of electrolytes containing chloride ions is generally not recommended due to the possible formation of toxic chlorinated by products 41 74 therefore phytotoxicity tests were performed on the solutions treated by the processes that use electrolysis to analyze whether the treated solutions were less detrimental than the initial solution the tests were performed after 1 5 10 and 15 h of treatment to investigate the variation in the toxicity of the solution over time fig 4 d shows the ec 50 results for the ec and paec methods in addition for the paec method tests were carried out with two different ultraviolet intensities 125 and 250 w fig 4 d shows that for all the methods evaluated toxicity increased in the first hours of treatment and then decreased over time indicating the formation of degradation products more toxic than the original compound and subsequent degradation of these products for the ec method the toxicity of the solution increased from 25 3 to 2 3 in the first 10 h of treatment and then reduced after 15 h of electrolysis the toxicity from 2 3 to 15 8 however the treated effluent showed a greater toxicity than the original sample when purely electrochemical treatment was employed this toxicity may also be due to the possible formation of perchlorate clo4 during electrolysis in a medium containing chloride however according to the literature the formation of clo4 is reduced when an electrode containing ruo2 is used in comparison with other materials such as bdd electrodes 42 45 in a study found in the literature on the electrochemical peroxidation of cip using stainless steel electrodes 54 the authors obtained as degradation by products the compounds known as phthalates these by products have high chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity on the other hand another study that evaluated the degradation of cip by the uv chlorine aop 16 found by products such as trichloroacetaldehyde and dichloroacetonitrile which can later be degraded into co2 h2o f and other low molecular weight species normally saline only solutions did not show acute toxicity 43 however high nacl content can cause inhibition of germination and growth of l sativa seedlings 75 due to the decrease in osmotic potential in fact the initial solution containing nacl 0 3 mol l without cip showed moderate toxicity gi 66 8 table s2 in supplementary material furthermore a toxicity test performed containing only the supporting electrolyte nacl treated by the ec process showed high toxicity gi 7 5 these results indicate that even when only nacl is present the electrochemical treatment itself can lead to the formation of toxic species the 125 w and 250 w paec methods showed less toxicity than that observed in ec after 15 h of electrolysis fig 4 d in the first hours of electrolysis paec methods showed higher values of toxicity compared to ec this result may be due to the high rate of degradation of the paec technique leading to the generation of smaller and probably more toxic products which undergo degradation after a certain time as a result the toxicity of the solution is higher at the beginning of electrolysis for the paec method and decreases over time this difference in toxicity is possibly due to the generation of chlorinated intermediates products which are degraded more rapidly by the paec process than by the ec in addition with simultaneous uv radiation and electrooxidation acs undergo photolysis avoiding the formation of organochlorines clo2 clo3 and clo4 43 testing with the paec method using ultraviolet light with greater power 250 w was carried out it is possible to observe fig 4 d for the paec250w method that the toxicity of the solution at the end of 15 h is almost the same compared to the initial sample this means that the treatment did not decrease the toxicity of the initial cip solution but the paec250w method did not cause an increase in toxicity indicating that no degradation products toxic to the test organism lactuca sativa were formed this result is important because although the effluent has a high degree of salinity the toxicity of the solution did not increase after using the technique previous studies have reported greater efficiency in reducing effluent toxicity when the combination of techniques paec was used 45 alves et al 42 reported the formation of organically bound adsorbable halogens aox during the textile effluent electrolysis and found that the use of simultaneous uv irradiation to the electrochemical process paec was able to reduce the formation of aox below 50 compared to the purely ec technique in addition the authors also observed that the paec method increased the toxicity of wastewater in the first 6 h and then decreased until it reached toxicity close to the initial solution after 10 h of treatment for the ec method the treated effluent became much more toxic after 10 h of electrolysis malpass et al 43 observed that the paec treatment reduced the toxicity of the initial effluent containing atrazine even when nacl is used as a supporting electrolyte florencio et al 46 reported simultaneous production and destruction of organochlorine compounds in lower concentrations for the paec method than for the ec thus it is evident that the use of the combined technique paec can decrease the accumulation of organochlorines and other by products such as perchlorate chlorate and chlorite 3 7 proposed cip degradation mechanism during the photo assisted electrochemical process in a chloride containing medium the species ho cl and hocl ph 5 eqs 1 6 present on the surface of the electrode and within the solution can react with the different chemical groups of the drug molecule fig s4 in supplementary material 39 47 forming degradation intermediates five structures of intermediate products of cip degradation have been proposed such as p336 m z 336 p318 m z 318 p304 m z 304 p277 m z 277 and p267 m z 267 table s1 in supplementary material based on the most relevant fragment ions obtained through the product ion analysis and the studies reported in the literature the cip degradation pathways were elucidated according to the identified intermediate compounds and using ho as the main oxidant the cip degradation mechanism suggested here involved three main possible reaction pathways fig 5 pathway 1 was piperazine ring oxidation a common pathway for oxidation of fluoroquinolones via ho 16 47 67 76 partial breakdown of the piperazinyl portion of cip generated m z 304 analogous to the electrochemical degradation product of cip reported by chen et al 68 subsequently further oxidation of the piperazine ring at m z 304 led to the production of m z 277 pathway 2 was the quinolone hydroxylation process plus defluorination according to the cip electron boundary density calculation performed by an et al 5 the hydroxyl radical is more likely to attack the quinolone ring thus the ho attack on the quinolone portion added to the fluoride loss resulted in the formation of m z 318 p318 m z 318 was found by chen et al 68 during anodic oxidation of cip using graphite felt anodes in pathway 3 the product m z 336 was generated indicating that the quinolone ring was broken attacked at the cyclopropyl group and hydroxylated on the piperazine ring studies in the literature 32 revealed that the piperazine group is the region most likely to be attacked by hocl through an initial transfer of cl to the n atom producing a chloronium ion followed by the addition of the oh ion leading to the breaking of the nc bond in addition the compound underwent a subsequent electrophilic addition of chlorine on the aromatic ring then m z 336 underwent decarboxylation complete removal of the cyclopropyl group further oxidation of the piperazine ring and further addition of chlorine to the benzene ring these by products can be mineralized through successive degradation reactions the quinolone portion or the peripheral portions fluorine carboxyl group cyclopropyl group and piperazine ring are considered essential in the antibacterial activity of fluoroquinolones 32 the by products formed show that these portions are gradually destroyed generating compounds with weaker antibiotic activity and lower risk of inducing the proliferation of bacterial resistance 4 conclusion in summary cip electrooxidation was successfully performed in a filter press flow reactor using the dsa anode of composition ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 the performance of cip removal that is initial oxidation of the molecule in degradation by products was affected by the applied current density nacl concentration volumetric flow and initial ph under optimized conditions j 60 7 ma cm2 nacl 0 3 mol l q v 10 ml min and ph 5 complete degradation of cip was achieved with just 5 min of treatment and about 60 toc and 65 cod were removed after 1 h of electrolysis in contrast the mineralization rate was slower after the first hour of treatment and the removal of toc and cod was practically performed after 16 h of electrolysis during the treatment high mineralization current efficiency 55 2 in 30 min and low values of energy consumption per unit mass of removed toc in the range of 0 16 1 9 kwh g were obtained electrooxidation of cip using dsa anode showed better results than for bdd anode in the literature the paec method allowed the favoring of the mineralization reactions in comparison with the isolated techniques ec and pc the more efficient degradation of the organic content by the paec method can be attributed to the photolysis of the acs to produce ho transforming a common electrochemical process into an advanced oxidation process in addition as expected the toxicity of the solution increased during the electrochemical treatment in nacl due to the formation of degradation by products containing toxic chlorine however despite the high degree of salinity of the effluent the paec method with 250 w ultraviolet did not increase the toxicity of the solution indicating that there was no formation of toxic degradation products for the test organism l sativa the results of the phytotoxicity test added to the in situ generation of acs and its subsequent photolysis for the generation of highly oxidizing species make the process studied here promising for industrial applications in the treatment of effluents finally the by products generated from the degradation of cip have weaker antibiotic activity and consequently have a lower environmental impact in addition

13018,this study aimed to investigate and improve the performance of the photo assisted electrochemical process paec for the degradation of ciprofloxacin cip and the production of active chlorine species acs using a dsa dimensionally stable anodes electrode nacl as the supporting electrolyte and uv radiation provided by a high pressure mercury lamp uvc the performance of the system was assessed by monitoring the cip concentration acs chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc and phytotoxicity tests the effect of operational parameters such as current density nacl concentration volumetric flow and initial ph of the solution were evaluated under operating conditions of j 60 7 ma cm2 nacl 0 3 mol l q v 10 ml min and ph 5 complete removal of cip was achieved in 5 min and with only 1 h of electrolysis removal of approximately 60 toc and 65 cod was obtained the paec process promoted greater mineralization of the solution in relation to the isolated techniques and the phytotoxicity tests indicated that despite the high salinity of the effluent 0 3 mol l nacl the paec process uvc 250 w did not generate an increase in toxicity of the treated solution the elucidated cip degradation mechanism indicates that the piperazine group was the most attacked site of the molecule furthermore the identified intermediates show that cip was gradually destroyed generating compounds with a lower risk of increasing bacterial resistance proliferation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords emerging contaminant photo assisted electrochemical degradation effluent treatment active chlorine antibiotic 1 introduction the occurrence of emerging contaminants in wastewater and the environment has been the subject of many studies as they pose serious threats to the ecosystem and human health 1 4 among emerging contaminants pharmaceutical compounds such as antibiotics have drawn considerable attention due to the presence of antibacterial drugs in the environment inducing the proliferation of bacterial resistance to drugs 2 5 8 low concentrations of antibiotics are found in industrial and hospital effluents 100 500 mg l and in urban wastewater 3 9 10 being discharged into the environment through the excreta of humans and animals or through the inappropriate disposal of expired formulations 11 one of the most prescribed antibiotic in the world is ciprofloxacin cip 12 13 after administering a dose of cip a percentage of the dose is excreted unaltered 15 50 and as metabolites 10 15 in urine within 24 h 14 cip is among the top ten emerging high priority contaminants and its presence in wastewater and surface water even in low concentration is considered an environmental risk 13 15 cip is persistent in the environment and can induce selection of microbial populations generating bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics 16 therefore finding an effective way to remove it from wastewater is of paramount importance the appearance of emerging contaminants in the environment has demonstrated the inefficiency of conventional methods such as biological processes sedimentation filtration coagulation and flocculation used in wastewater treatment plants to remove these contaminants 8 several technologies have been developed as options for treating wastewater containing cip such as ozonation 17 and membrane separation 18 however these technologies are costly and difficult to apply industrially among these technologies advanced oxidation processes aop are an alternative for the degradation of this contaminant due to the high oxidation rates obtained 19 20 however some aops require the handling of hazardous chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide in fenton reactions 21 22 on the other hand electrochemical treatment is based on the in situ production of highly oxidizing species to promote the mineralization of contaminants 19 23 24 regarding the operational costs necessary to perform some aop such as electrochemical oxidation fenton and ozonation 25 the electrochemical treatment has been shown to be less expensive than the ozonation process in addition although the fenton technology generally has a lower investment cost compared to electrooxidation the accumulation of oxidation refractory compounds in fenton process makes it necessary to use additional treatments and can significantly increase the cost of operating the process moreover the electrode material used strongly influences the efficiency of the electrochemical process 25 dimensionally stable anodes dsa especially composed of a tio2 ruo2 mixture have proven to be valuable for the environmental electrochemical community which have been applied as electrodes for degradation of organic contaminants 23 26 28 because they present high stability under extreme electrolysis conditions commercial availability and relatively low manufacturing costs 29 30 in addition under specific ph conditions and in a chloride containing medium another characteristic of dsa electrodes is the ease of formation of oxidizing active chlorine species acs dissolved cl2 hocl and or ocl that can considerably increase the rate of organic removal 31 32 the action of acs depends on the ph of the solution where cl2 is predominant at ph 3 0 ocl at ph 8 0 and hocl in the ph range between 3 0 and 8 0 being hocl and ocl produced through the electrochemical formation of cl2 from cl and subsequent dissolution of cl2 in aqueous medium eqs 1 2 and 3 33 34 therefore the electrochemical oxidation of organic contaminants in a chloride containing medium must be faster at ph 8 0 since the standard potential values of cl2 e 1 36 v she and hocl e 1 49 v she are higher than that of clo e 0 89 v she 1 2 cl cl 2 aq 2 e 2 cl 2 aq h 2 o hocl cl h 3 hocl ocl h pk a 7 5 the use of nacl as a supporting electrolyte is interesting in view of it being a low cost reagent and due to the in situ production of acs which are strong oxidizing agents 35 however in many studies na2so4 is chosen as a supporting electrolyte in electrochemical processes 36 39 even though it has a lower removal rate than nacl 40 since there is a lesser chance of generating toxic organochlorine species and other such as clo2 clo3 and clo4 41 that can significantly increase the toxicity of treated effluents however some studies in the literature indicate that the combination of the electrochemical process with simultaneous ultraviolet irradiation can reduce toxicity and organochlorine production 42 43 in addition acs can undergo photolysis mediated by uv radiation and generate highly reactive photo oxidants such as ho and cl eqs 4 5 and 6 16 this fact transforms a common electrochemical process into an aop 4 hocl hv ho cl 5 ocl h 2 o hv ho ho cl 6 cl 2 hv 2 cl although photo assisted electrochemical wastewater treatment has been extensively studied 36 37 39 44 49 there are few studies that investigate the possibility of reducing the toxicity of the treated solution when nacl is used as supporting electrolyte by the photo assisted electrochemical coupled technique compared to the isolated electrochemical technique 42 43 based on these issues the present study aimed to investigate the performance of the photo assisted electrochemical paec process in the degradation of the cip antibiotic using dsa anode and nacl as supporting electrolyte the effect of the experimental variables current density nacl concentration volumetric flow and initial ph was evaluated on the degradation of cip and the production of acs the process kinetics were evaluated by adjusting the pseudo first order nonlinear model to the kinetic data the best condition obtained was used to evaluate the mineralization process through analysis of chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc experiments with isolated processes electrochemical and photochemical were performed for comparative purposes with the paec process in addition phytotoxicity tests were performed on the solutions treated by the processes that employ electrolysis to assess the acute toxicity of the solution containing the cip antibiotic although cip is one of the most consumed antibiotics in the world and a contaminant of emerging concern studies involving its removal by the photo assisted electrochemical technique are scarce in the literature even if cip was previously treated by a photo assisted electrochemical process in a chloride containing medium to produce radicals with higher oxidation potentials compared to the original active chlorine 47 the toxicity of the treated solution was not evaluated therefore the main focus of this work is to evaluate the photo assisted electrochemical coupled technique and demonstrate that it is possible to use nacl as a supporting electrolyte to improve the degradation mineralization of the cip contaminant and at the same time benefit the toxicity of the treated solution when compared to the purely electrochemical technique which demonstrates the relevance of this article 2 experimental 2 1 pharmaceutical contaminant synthetic solutions of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride cip 1 mmol l ems pharmaceuticals brazil 99 9

photochemical were performed for comparative purposes with the paec process 2 4 kinetic modeling in electrochemical oxidation processes the degradation of organic compounds at low concentrations generally obeys pseudo first order kinetics 33 42 48 50 therefore nonlinear kinetic model of pseudo first order eq 7 was employed in experimental data the quality of the fit of the model to the data

organism lactuca sativa lettuce 55 which was kept as seed until the test was conducted to assess the possible generation of toxic compounds during degradation the germination method of the test organism lactuca sativa is an excellent tool for bioassays of effluent toxicity since it has high sensitivity to chemical stress rapid germination easy cultivation low cost reproducibility and simple operation in addition the tests indicate the possibility of reusing treated effluent for plant irrigation 56 briefly ten seeds were placed on a filter paper soaked in 2 ml of sample inside a petri dish the plates were covered and sealed with film paper to avoid evaporation losses ultrapure reverse osmosis water os20lxe gehaka was used in the control experiments the seeds were incubated for 120

diffraction xrd patterns for the dsa electrode composed of ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 and the ti counter electrode obtained commercially at the ti cathode large peaks associated with metallic ti jcpds 04 316 were observed at 2θ 53 40 and 28 attributed to 0 1 2 0 1 1 and 0 0 2 reflection planes respectively the analysis performed to identify the crystalline phases of the dsa electrode revealed the presence of tio2 jcpds 00 9161 and ruo2 jcpds 05 1159 attributed to 1 1 0 at 2θ 28 0 1 1 at 2θ 35 and 1 2 1 at 2θ 54 reflection planes the presence of metallic ti was also detected due to the support substrate tio2 and ruo2 crystallize in the same tetragonal crystalline structure and have a rutile structure which according to the hume rothery theory this mixed metal oxides can form a solid solution where ti4 and ru4 share the same location in the sub cationic network of a tetragonal phase 28 58 59 since the ionic radius of ti4 0 075 nm and ru4 0 076 nm are similar ruo2 oxide grows in a tio2 rutile layer previously formed on the ti substrate the tio2 layer can guide the growth of ruo2 in the tetragonal structure favored by the similarity in its network parameters sem micrograph analysis was performed to evaluate the electrode texture fig s2 in supplementary material the ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 dsa anode images show morphology with a characteristic of cracked mud fig s2 a in supplementary material typical of oxide films prepared by the thermal decomposition route these cracks are caused by thermal shocks during calcination 30 32 60 this type of morphology gives the electrodes a high

electrode demonstrated to have a much larger internal area sem images for the ti based cathode fig s2 b in supplementary material show homogeneous morphology with some defects generated in the mechanical polishing process and typical characteristic of an amorphous surface moreover edx analysis of the electrodes confirms the majority presence of ti 99 8 in the ti cathode and of the elements ti o and ru 30 8 47 8 and 8 2 respectively in the dsa anode in addition the distribution of the mapping of the elements shows a good dispersion of each element along the surface of the electrodes fig s2 in supplementary material 3 2 cip degradation 3 2 1 effect of current density the effect of applied current density j was investigated at 14 3 60 7 and 107 1 ma cm2 the range of values of j investigated was chosen considering the limiting current density for the evolution of cl2 j lim 12 ma cm2 for the flux reactor see 19 estimated using a value of the mass transfer coefficient k m 2 07 10 6 m s obtained as described by cañizares et al 25 and perereita et al 61 see supplementary material by pereira et al 61 and the investigations of cyclic voltammetry of the electrode ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 in nacl performed by malpass et al 62 thus the limit anodic current density for the evolution of cl2 remained between approximately 2 and 12 ma cm2 considering that the cl concentration ranged from 0 1 to 0 6 mol l in the experiments evaluated here consequently as the investigated current density range 14 3 107 1 ma cm2 is greater than the limiting anodic current density j lim 12 ma cm2 the system is under mass transport control in which concerns the evolution of cl2 fig 2 a shows the decline in the concentration of cip during the photo assisted electrochemical treatment by the current densities j of 14 3 60 7 and 107 1 ma cm2 fig 2 a shows that cip removal increased from 73 to approximately 100 with an increase in j from 14 3 to 60 7 ma cm2 respectively after 10 min of degradation it is evident that the increase in current density reduced the degradation time of the cip from 20 min 14 3 ma cm2 to 5 min 60 7 ma cm2 and 3 min 107 1 ma cm2 it is worth noting that the cip degradation slowly decreased when the applied current density was greater than 60 7 ma cm2 implying that a higher current density 60 7 ma cm2 does not significantly accelerate the cip decay rate this behavior may have occurred because the evolution of o2 becomes the main reaction of the electrode when high values of current density are applied 8 and consequently decreases the production of oxidizing agents such as the ho and acs radicals generating lower current efficiency values as seen in fig 3 a similar behavior was observed in the electrochemical degradation of sulfamethoxazole by ti sno2 sb ce pbo2 anode 63 and of dimethyl phthalate ester by dsa anode 19 when high current density values are applied the electrochemical reactions tend to be controlled mainly by the mass transfer of the electrolyte while the simultaneous evolution of oxygen at the anode is the main factor that decreases the current efficiency 64 as seen in table 1 as j increased from 60 7 to 107 1 ma cm2 the kinetic constant k had an increase of about 4 times however although the value of the pseudo first order kinetic constant k increased slightly from 0 8 to 1 2 min 1 table 1 with an increase in current density from 60 7 to 107 1 ma cm2 energy consumption increased from 0 81 to 1 41 kwh cm3 since an excess current supply led to wasted energy the current density of 60 7 ma cm2 was ideal 3 2 2 effect of nacl concentration nacl was used as a support electrolyte in the electrooxidation of cip as seen in fig 2 b cip removal values of 99 0 0 6 mol l 99 4 0 3 mol l and 97 8 0 1 mol l were obtained after 5 min of electrooxidation the cip removal rate increased when the nacl concentration was 0 1 k 0 68 min 1 to 0 3 mol l k 0 82 min 1 table 1 this result demonstrated that the nacl concentration exhibited a slight effect on the removal of cip due to the formation of the produced acs eq 2 ph 5 however with the nacl concentration of 0 6 mol l k 0 86 min 1 there was no significant effect on the cip removal rate this behavior may be due to parasitic reactions of chlorine consumption and may form more recalcitrant compounds than the original compound generating less current efficiency values fig 3 b and therefore lower levels of sample mineralization would be achieved 65 the ee o value decreased from 1 47 to 0 83 kwh m3 as the nacl increased from 0 1 to 0 3 mol l table 1 however with the increase in nacl concentration to 0 6 mol l no significant decrease in energy consumption was observed thus it can be said that the concentration of nacl of 0 3 mol l provided a slight improvement in the rate of degradation of cip and in the consumption of energy therefore it was selected in the subsequent experiments 3 2 3 effect of volumetric flow volumetric flow q v is an important factor since the influence of q v in the process indicates whether the process is controlled by electron transfer or by mass transfer 35 fig 2 c and the k values table 1 show that the cip removal rate increased with increasing flow which may indicate that the process is limited by mass transport high q v values improve the transfer of electrolyte and organic species to the anode surface resulting in better degradation performance 11 studies in the literature of electrochemical degradation in a flow reactor of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin using an β pbo2 anode 11 and dye reactive orange 16 using a pt electrode 35 also obtained a rate of improved cip degradation with increased volumetric flow the elimination of cip can be considered rapid since cip removal values of 99 4 10 ml min 97 5 6 ml min and 85 5 2 ml min were obtained after only 5 min of electrooxidation in addition energy consumption was lower at the highest analyzed q v value 0 83 kwh m3 and increased approximately 2 7 times when q v decreased from 10 ml min to 2 ml min table 1 the best values of cip removal and energy savings were obtained for the highest q v value observed based on these results the flow rate used in the subsequent experiments was 10 ml min 3 2 4 effect of ph ph is an important factor in the electrooxidation process since it is related to the degradation of cip as it is a zwitterionic compound pk a1 6 1 and pk a2 8 7 where at ph above 8 7 cip has a negative charge in the carboxyl group and below ph 6 1 positive charge in the piperazine portion fig 3 c moreover the relative concentrations of hocl and ocl depend on the ph as it is a weak acid eq 3 and fig 3 c which influences photolysis of acs according to eqs 4 to 6 figs 2 d and 3 c show the effect of the initial ph on the degradation of cip after 10 min of degradation cip removal values of 88 2 ph 3 99 2 ph 5 82 8 ph 7 and 91 9 ph 10 fig 3 c were obtained the cip abatement at ph 7 obtained the lowest removal value 82 8 in relation to the other phs since the dissociation in ph between 6 5 and 8 5 is incomplete and the two species hocl and ocl are present in small concentrations 34 43 when the ph is reduced to 3 hocl and cl2 coexist in solution which influences the removal of cip 88 2 due to the formation of radicals resulting from the homolysis of acs eqs 4 and 6 in addition the difference in removal at ph 3 and 7 may have occurred due to the cip load in relation to ph where the principal cip species is zwitterionic at ph 7 and cationic at ph 3 fig 3 c which may have favored the electrostatic attraction due to the positive charge of the molecule at ph 3 generating a better removal result above ph 8 5 all hocl dissociates to the hypochlorous ion ocl and at ph between 3 5 and 6 5 there is no dissociation of hocl therefore removal of cip at ph 5 showed a better result 99 2 than at ph 10 91 9 since hocl has a greater germicidal effect than ocl 49 the highest k value was obtained at an initial ph of 5 0 82 min 1 and the lowest k was obtained at a ph of 7 0 24 min 1 suggesting an increase of approximately 3 4 times in the mass transfer coefficient in addition the lowest energy expenditure was obtained at ph 5 0 83 kwh m3 table 1 these results suggest that ph values between 3 5 and 6 5 favor rapid decay of cip once the highest hocl concentration values are produced under these conditions 47 the that with the use of ultraviolet irradiation enhances the production of ho a highly oxidative radical although the ph showed a slight difference in cip removal the removal rates were all over 90 after 15 min of electrooxidation these results suggest a broad ph range in the application of the photo assisted electrochemical process with dsa electrodes unlike some advanced oxidation processes such as the fenton process in which the production of ho is highly influenced by ph restricting the process to acidic ph 21 22 a possible explanation for this difference may be because the dsa electrodes have high activity regardless of the ph of the solution a similar result was obtained in the electrochemical degradation of cip by the bdd boron doped diamond anode 66 who observed that there is no need for deliberate adjustment in the ph value of the solution during the process 3 3 comparison with other electrodes the electrochemical oxidation tests are not directly compared due to the experimental conditions such as spacing between the electrodes volumetric flow current density temperature ph among others influencing the oxidation process of the organic compound table 2 compares the electrolysis times the pseudo first order kinetic constants k and the electrical efficiency per log order ee o obtained experimentally by cip electrooxidation under the best operating conditions obtained in this study with different anodes found in the literature wang et al 67 evaluated the electrochemical oxidation of cip using a sno2 sb ti anode and reported that higher initial cip concentration values inhibited the removal efficiency of cip degradation however for the system using dsa anode a high removal rate was obtained even with a cip concentration k 0 8 min 1 with c 0 368 mg l much higher than that evaluated by wang et al 67 k 0 046 min 1 with c 0 50 mg l the other studies that investigated the anodic oxidation of cip also obtained low values of reaction rate using the electrodes a gf k 0 033 min 1 b gf k 0 028 min 1 68 ti pt β pbo2 k 0 037 min 1 11 and ti sbruzr k 0 046 min 1 32 li et al 66 assessed the electrochemical degradation of cip at the bdd anode and obtained a relatively low ee o value of 1 47 kwh m3 however an ee o value of 1 78 times lower was obtained using the dsa anode which indicates superior characteristic of the dsa electrode of all the electrodes evaluated the dsa anode obtained the lowest result of energy consumption ee o and exhibited a reaction rate constant k comparatively higher than the other materials studied moreover the time required for cip electrolysis by the dsa anode was much shorter 5 min than with the other different anodes reported in the literature 20 120 min these results indicate that the dsa electrode has an excellent oxidation performance 3 4 mineralization performance under operating conditions of j 64 7 ma cm2 nacl 0 3 mol l q v 10 ml min and ph 5 a prolonged electrolysis was performed to assess the process mineralization the removal of toc and cod from the sample was significantly slower 16 h fig 4 a compared to the simple degradation of cip 5 min fig 2 as would be expected for a relatively large organic molecule c17h18fn3o3 initially sample mineralization was rapid and during the first hour of treatment by photo assisted electrochemical technology approximately 60 toc and 65 cod were removed however the mineralization rate decreased after 1 h of degradation with removal of 91 8 toc and 98 2 cod after 16 h fig 4 a this can be attributed to the formation of oxidation intermediates with greater resistance to attack by cl and ho radicals eqs 4 5 and 6 than the original compound cip 47 the evolution of mce and ec m kwh g during toc removal by the paec process with dsa anode is shown in fig 4 b the values of the mineralization current efficiency mce are high at the beginning 55 2 with 50 toc removed and decrease over the course of treatment 3 1 because of the reduction of organic matter and the o2 evolution reaction becomes the predominant process based on the literature the highest mce value is 9 2 times greater than the best one obtained from electrolysis of cip using a bdd electrode 6 in addition fig 4 b shows that the ec m increased from 0 16 to 1 9 kwh g obtaining lower values than found in the literature in the electrooxidation of cip by bdd anode 1 5 4 0 kwh g 6 indicating greater oxidation power of the dsa anode 3 5 comparison to isolated techniques literature studies have reported that the photo assisted electrochemical process can significantly increase the removal rate of organic species compared to individual techniques electrochemistry and photochemistry 26 fig 4 c shows that the processes that employ electrolysis ec and paec showed satisfactory toc removal values 80 while for the isolated photochemical pc process only about 6 toc removed after 10 h of treatment furthermore after 10 min of treatment it was possible to observe satisfactory removal of cip 98 by the paec and ec processes while the photochemical process was able to remove only about 24 of the drug fig s3 in supplementary material as reported by a previous study these results show that the removal of organic matter is directly related to the oxidizing species generated electrochemically in solution 23 26 electrochemical enhancement coefficient e can be quantified by eq 16 69 70 16 e k paec k ec k paec 100 where k paec and k ec are pseudo first order kinetic constants of cip degradation by paec and ec respectively the results showed that the coupling of electrochemical and photochemical techniques uvc 125 w resulted in a 10 8 increase in effects table 3 for cip degradation since the techniques showed additive effects in this study the synergy coefficient could be calculated see 69 70 however as the degradation of cip by the purely photochemical process pc did not present a good fit by the pseudo first order model table 3 the calculation of the synergistic effect s was performed based on the extent of mineralization of the techniques coupled according to eq 17 71 72 the positive value of s means that the individual processes support each other 17 s x c x i 1 100 where x c is the percentage of toc removal by the coupled techniques and x i is the sum of the percentages of toc removal by the isolated techniques a positive synergistic effect of 7 1 was obtained using eq 17 for the coupled techniques paec table 3 in this way the paec oxidation proved to be more efficient compared to the individual processes this is probably due to the formation of ho during the use of uv radiation on the surface of tio2 together with the electrochemical oxidation mechanism of cip that happens in the places where ruo2 is present in the anode 29 48 73 it was verified fig 4 c that the anodic process irradiated by ultraviolet light paec favored mineralization reactions cip mineralization by the pc process alone was around 0 6 and by the ec process around 56 in 1 h while the combined paec techniques provide 60 mineralization in 1 h in the ideal condition of j 64 7 ma cm2 nacl 0 3 mol l q v 10 ml min and ph 5 in the purely electrochemical process the main active chlorine species present in the would be hocl ph 5 however with simultaneous uv radiation and electrooxidation acs undergo photolysis and generate highly reactive photo oxidants such as ho and cl 16 3 6 phytotoxicity residual toxicity of the effluent is an important parameter to be investigated when it comes to complex effluents in addition it is known that the use of electrolytes containing chloride ions is generally not recommended due to the possible formation of toxic chlorinated by products 41 74 therefore phytotoxicity tests were performed on the solutions treated by the processes that use electrolysis to analyze whether the treated solutions were less detrimental than the initial solution the tests were performed after 1 5 10 and 15 h of treatment to investigate the variation in the toxicity of the solution over time fig 4 d shows the ec 50 results for the ec and paec methods in addition for the paec method tests were carried out with two different ultraviolet intensities 125 and 250 w fig 4 d shows that for all the methods evaluated toxicity increased in the first hours of treatment and then decreased over time indicating the formation of degradation products more toxic than the original compound and subsequent degradation of these products for the ec method the toxicity of the solution increased from 25 3 to 2 3 in the first 10 h of treatment and then reduced after 15 h of electrolysis the toxicity from 2 3 to 15 8 however the treated effluent showed a greater toxicity than the original sample when purely electrochemical treatment was employed this toxicity may also be due to the possible formation of perchlorate clo4 during electrolysis in a medium containing chloride however according to the literature the formation of clo4 is reduced when an electrode containing ruo2 is used in comparison with other materials such as bdd electrodes 42 45 in a study found in the literature on the electrochemical peroxidation of cip using stainless steel electrodes 54 the authors obtained as degradation by products the compounds known as phthalates these by products have high chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity on the other hand another study that evaluated the degradation of cip by the uv chlorine aop 16 found by products such as trichloroacetaldehyde and dichloroacetonitrile which can later be degraded into co2 h2o f and other low molecular weight species normally saline only solutions did not show acute toxicity 43 however high nacl content can cause inhibition of germination and growth of l sativa seedlings 75 due to the decrease in osmotic potential in fact the initial solution containing nacl 0 3 mol l without cip showed moderate toxicity gi 66 8 table s2 in supplementary material furthermore a toxicity test performed containing only the supporting electrolyte nacl treated by the ec process showed high toxicity gi 7 5 these results indicate that even when only nacl is present the electrochemical treatment itself can lead to the formation of toxic species the 125 w and 250 w paec methods showed less toxicity than that observed in ec after 15 h of electrolysis fig 4 d in the first hours of electrolysis paec methods showed higher values of toxicity compared to ec this result may be due to the high rate of degradation of the paec technique leading to the generation of smaller and probably more toxic products which undergo degradation after a certain time as a result the toxicity of the solution is higher at the beginning of electrolysis for the paec method and decreases over time this difference in toxicity is possibly due to the generation of chlorinated intermediates products which are degraded more rapidly by the paec process than by the ec in addition with simultaneous uv radiation and electrooxidation acs undergo photolysis avoiding the formation of organochlorines clo2 clo3 and clo4 43 testing with the paec method using ultraviolet light with greater power 250 w was carried out it is possible to observe fig 4 d for the paec250w method that the toxicity of the solution at the end of 15 h is almost the same compared to the initial sample this means that the treatment did not decrease the toxicity of the initial cip solution but the paec250w method did not cause an increase in toxicity indicating that no degradation products toxic to the test organism lactuca sativa were formed this result is important because although the effluent has a high degree of salinity the toxicity of the solution did not increase after using the technique previous studies have reported greater efficiency in reducing effluent toxicity when the combination of techniques paec was used 45 alves et al 42 reported the formation of organically bound adsorbable halogens aox during the textile effluent electrolysis and found that the use of simultaneous uv irradiation to the electrochemical process paec was able to reduce the formation of aox below 50 compared to the purely ec technique in addition the authors also observed that the paec method increased the toxicity of wastewater in the first 6 h and then decreased until it reached toxicity close to the initial solution after 10 h of treatment for the ec method the treated effluent became much more toxic after 10 h of electrolysis malpass et al 43 observed that the paec treatment reduced the toxicity of the initial effluent containing atrazine even when nacl is used as a supporting electrolyte florencio et al 46 reported simultaneous production and destruction of organochlorine compounds in lower concentrations for the paec method than for the ec thus it is evident that the use of the combined technique paec can decrease the accumulation of organochlorines and other by products such as perchlorate chlorate and chlorite 3 7 proposed cip degradation mechanism during the photo assisted electrochemical process in a chloride containing medium the species ho cl and hocl ph 5 eqs 1 6 present on the surface of the electrode and within the solution can react with the different chemical groups of the drug molecule fig s4 in supplementary material 39 47 forming degradation intermediates five structures of intermediate products of cip degradation have been proposed such as p336 m z 336 p318 m z 318 p304 m z 304 p277 m z 277 and p267 m z 267 table s1 in supplementary material based on the most relevant fragment ions obtained through the product ion analysis and the studies reported in the literature the cip degradation pathways were elucidated according to the identified intermediate compounds and using ho as the main oxidant the cip degradation mechanism suggested here involved three main possible reaction pathways fig 5 pathway 1 was piperazine ring oxidation a common pathway for oxidation of fluoroquinolones via ho 16 47 67 76 partial breakdown of the piperazinyl portion of cip generated m z 304 analogous to the electrochemical degradation product of cip reported by chen et al 68 subsequently further oxidation of the piperazine ring at m z 304 led to the production of m z 277 pathway 2 was the quinolone hydroxylation process plus defluorination according to the cip electron boundary density calculation performed by an et al 5 the hydroxyl radical is more likely to attack the quinolone ring thus the ho attack on the quinolone portion added to the fluoride loss resulted in the formation of m z 318 p318 m z 318 was found by chen et al 68 during anodic oxidation of cip using graphite felt anodes in pathway 3 the product m z 336 was generated indicating that the quinolone ring was broken attacked at the cyclopropyl group and hydroxylated on the piperazine ring studies in the literature 32 revealed that the piperazine group is the region most likely to be attacked by hocl through an initial transfer of cl to the n atom producing a chloronium ion followed by the addition of the oh ion leading to the breaking of the nc bond in addition the compound underwent a subsequent electrophilic addition of chlorine on the aromatic ring then m z 336 underwent decarboxylation complete removal of the cyclopropyl group further oxidation of the piperazine ring and further addition of chlorine to the benzene ring these by products can be mineralized through successive degradation reactions the quinolone portion or the peripheral portions fluorine carboxyl group cyclopropyl group and piperazine ring are considered essential in the antibacterial activity of fluoroquinolones 32 the by products formed show that these portions are gradually destroyed generating compounds with weaker antibiotic activity and lower risk of inducing the proliferation of bacterial resistance 4 conclusion in summary cip electrooxidation was successfully performed in a filter press flow reactor using the dsa anode of composition ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 the performance of cip removal that is initial oxidation of the molecule in degradation by products was affected by the applied current density nacl concentration volumetric flow and initial ph under optimized conditions j 60 7 ma cm2 nacl 0 3 mol l q v 10 ml min and ph 5 complete degradation of cip was achieved with just 5 min of treatment and about 60 toc and 65 cod were removed after 1 h of electrolysis in contrast the mineralization rate was slower after the first hour of treatment and the removal of toc and cod was practically performed after 16 h of electrolysis during the treatment high mineralization current efficiency 55 2 in 30 min and low values of energy consumption per unit mass of removed toc in the range of 0 16 1 9 kwh g were obtained electrooxidation of cip using dsa anode showed better results than for bdd anode in the literature the paec method allowed the favoring of the mineralization reactions in comparison with the isolated techniques ec and pc the more efficient degradation of the organic content by the paec method can be attributed to the photolysis of the acs to produce ho transforming a common electrochemical process into an advanced oxidation process in addition as expected the toxicity of the solution increased during the electrochemical treatment in nacl due to the formation of degradation by products containing toxic chlorine however despite the high degree of salinity of the effluent the paec method with 250 w ultraviolet did not increase the toxicity of the solution indicating that there was no formation of toxic degradation products for the test organism l sativa the results of the phytotoxicity test added to the in situ generation of acs and its subsequent photolysis for the generation of highly oxidizing species make the process studied here promising for industrial applications in the treatment of effluents finally the by products generated from the degradation of cip have weaker antibiotic activity and consequently have a lower environmental impact in addition to a lower risk of inducing the proliferation of bacterial resistance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

13019,in this study we designed a heterogeneous graphene oxide go grafted on chitosan decorated with mno2 nanorods α mno2nrs go chit composite materials and its ability to remove the cationic and anionic toxic dyes from wastewaters were analysed the synthesised materials presented an effective stabilization of active mno2 nanorods nrs on the go chit surface the synthesised materials were detailed characterised by several spectroscopic and microscopic techniques such as ft ir p xrd sem tem raman tga xps bet co2 tpd and uv visible analysis in addition α mno2nrs go chit material is successfully applied in removal of industrial ionic dyes such as amido black 10b ab and methylene blue mb respectively the dye adsorption experiments confirmed that the go chit α mno2 nrs material exhibited remarkably high adsorption capacity in efficient removal of cationic dye methylene blue mb and anionic dye amido black 10b ab the maximum mb dye removal 97 process completed in 24 min at c0 30 mg l 1 but in the case of ab the maximum dye removal 80 process was reached in 700 min over go chit α mno2 nrs hybrid material a maximum theoretical monolayer adsorption qmax values is 328 9 mg g 1 of mb was calculated from the langmuir isotherm equation in case mb a faster adsorption and 2 18 times maximum adsorption capacity was achieved than that of ab10 dye the enhanced adsorption over α mno2nrs go chit is due to the increased surface functionalities i e oxygen containing groups high basicity and strong electrostatic forces between mno2 nanorods and go chit furthermore α mno2nrs go chit hybrid material displayed good stability after 10 successive adsorption tests graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene oxide chitosan mno2 nanorods wastewater adsorption ionic dyes 1 introduction dyes are the most significant chemical substances that have been extensively used in textile printing dyeing and paper industries the industrial dyes are commonly classified as cationic all basic dyes anionic reactive acid and direct dyes or non ionic dispersed dyes further the basic and reactive dyes are the most preferred ones owing to their better properties and favorable characteristics such as water solubility bright coloration less expensive and easy fabrication 1 5 these toxic ionic dyes remain unaffected when treated conventionally because of their structural complexity and synthetic origin the toxic ionic dyes released into water streams from textile industries are carcinogenic hazardous mutagenic and can cause serious threat to the aqueous environments 6 9 typically these toxic dyes can be found in small traces in industrial waste waters thus there is a need an efficient and easy method to remove these dyes from the wastewaters and possess a big challenge for the scientific community to develop and design a promising method and material industrial wastewater treatment plants are equipped with many process steps such as flocculation coagulation and precipitation for reducing the effluent harmful compounds moreover the emerging technologies such as photo biological and electrochemical dye degradation were also reported however the adsorption method is widely used technique highly feasible economical and effective in dye removal from aqueous streams the photocatalytic biological and electrochemical dye degradation has its limitations and disadvantages than adsorption method 2 3 8 over the past few decades carbon based hybrid adsorbent systems such as metal and metal oxides or mixed oxides based carbon composites have attracted significant attention in the removal of industrial dyes researchers reported that the graphene oxide go activated carbon ac graphene mesoporous carbon and carbon nanotubes cnts have been stacked and functionalized with various inorganic compounds metal oxides and metal nanoparticles 10 15 to exhibit better adsorption performance and stability moreover many different methods introduced to design a composite based material to have better conductivity higher surface area mechanical and thermal stability graphene oxide go has emerged as a promising and versatile material owing to its outstanding physicochemical properties such as porous structure tunable structure high surface area and high specific reactivity 16 17 moreover graphene oxide can be modified functionalized or pretreated to change its morphological or structural changes based on the application for example go can be functionalized with abundant functional groups such as epoxy hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups in providing multiple roles and functionalities of go for the utilization in desired applications functionalized go provides an exceptional support for docking the catalytic agent for surface chemical reactions further these materials trestle with substrate molecules via various bonding interactions like hydrogen hydrophobic electrostatic interactions and π π stretching for stimulating and activating the groups over the substrate and proximity to the catalysts 18 functionalized graphene sheets have enhanced the encapsulating efficiency as the go sheets possess more active surface area thereby improving the increased accessibility to the substrate molecules the incorporation of a moderately minimal number of nanoparticles over the go sheets was exhibited due to limitation in surface oxygen functionalities thus this surface limitations can be overcome by grafting the polymer structure onto the surface of go thereby proliferating the encapsulation or functionalized sites for metal or metal oxide nanoparticles 18 hence the primary goal was to graft chitosan with appropriate functional groups such as nh2 oh groups onto the graphene oxide substrate to increase the adsorptive sites one of the most abundant adsorbents is the manganese dioxide mno2 which has been contemplated as the potent adsorbent because of its environmental benign cost effectiveness and abundance 19 moreover it is known and highly applicable as a promising adsorbent such as in adsorption of heavy metals and methylene blue cationic pollutants owing to its negatively charged surface 20 21 additionally in an aquatic environment mno2 nanoparticles have better self aggregating properties with various ionic organic and inorganic pollutants 22 in this work we successfully designed novel mno2 nanorods decorated on graphene oxide grafted chitosan composite system in removal of toxic ionic industrial dyes for environmentally friendly method for comparison the dye removal ability of bare mno2 samples

on the graphene oxide surface go chit graphene oxide go was prepared using a reported procedure of hummers and offeman s method 18 with minor modifications in a typical reaction 1 g of graphite 1 g of nano3 and 50 ml of h2so4 were stirred together in an ice bath kmno4 3 g was slowly added to the stirring mixture and the rate of addition was controlled to prevent the temperature of reaction vessel from exceeding 20 c the mixture was then transferred in to a 35 c water bath and stirred for 1 h resulting in the formation of a thick paste subsequently 50 ml of deionized water was added slowly resulting in an increase in temperature to 98 c after 15 min the mixture was further treated with 150 ml deionized water and 10 ml of 30 h2o2 solution the warm solution was filtered and then washed with deionized water until a ph of 7 is reached and then the synthesised go was dried at 65 c under vacuum scheme 1 graphene oxide 0 5 g was dispersed in socl2 30 ml and stirred for 24 h at 70 c the resultant acylated go was collected by filtration and washed with tetrahydrofuran thf and the final product go cocl 0 495 g was dried under vacuum for 24 h at room temperature the acylated graphene oxide 0 5 g was first dispersed in 20 ml water using an ultrasonic bath for 1 h the reaction mixture was then shifted to 20 ml of 2 acetic acid containing 1 g of chitosan the resultant mixture was further allowed to stir at room temperature for 24 h the final go chit solution was filtered and then cleaned with de ionized water the filtered product was dried over night at 65 c under vacuum

mixture was kept under stirring to acquire a homogeneous solution and was autoclaved at 160 c for 8 h the product was filtered and washed with double distilled water and ethanol the final product was allowed to dry under vacuum at 50 c for overnight 2 4 dispersion of mno2 nanorods on the graphene oxide grafted chitosan surface mno2 nanorods were dispersed in ethanol before the addition of go chitosan the resulting suspension was sonicated for 5 10 min and then subjected to overnight stirring at 600 rpm using a magnetic stirrer the overnight agitated sample was centrifuged and dried in a vacuum at 40 c the sample with nominal 6 wt mno2 nrs loading was termed as go chit mno2nrs commercial mno2 p loaded onto the go chitosan was designated as mno2 p go chit 2 5 method for adsorption of

composite structure the peaks at 2θ values of 12 9 18 1 28 9 38 42 1 49 8 56 3 60 1 and 69 7 indicates the α mno2 jcpds 440141 representing the pure phase of α mno2 19 23 further characterised by ftir analysis to confirm the go formation chitosan grafting and decorated mno2 nanorods nrs over go chit scaffold it is evident that the formation of go from fig s1 b through the reflections of various types of oxygen based functionalities over the surface of go was evident through the appearance of oh stretching vibrations at 3422 cm 1 co stretching vibration at 1725 cm 1 unoxidized graphite domains cc at 1666 cm 1 c oh stretching vibrations at 1220 cm 1 and stretching vibrations for co at 1060 cm 1 respectively 24 in contrast fig s1 a doesn t show any peaks related to the bending and stretching vibrations of pure graphite due to absence of surface functionalities nevertheless only one vibrational peak is visible for graphitic aromatic benzene at 1666 cm 1 25 confirmative ft ir peaks are noticed for acyl group functionalized graphene oxide go cocl as shown in fig s1 c moreover the introduction of a new peak at 694 cm 1 along with co peak shift at 1694 cm 1 and the complete disappearance of oh stretching vibration at 3435 cm 1 was evident due to the construction of new ccl bond formation 26 27 the covalent immobilization of chitosan on to the go was further confirmed in fig s1 d through the appearance of conh amide bond peak at 1645 cm 1 ch2 aliphatic peak at 2095 cm 1 and the free nh and oh peaks of the chitosan polymer appearing at 3480 cm 1 28 additionally the stabilization of mno2nrs on the go chit can be seen in fig s1 e the disappearance of nh and oh stretching vibrations at 3480 cm 1 is due to decomposition and creation of defect sites which formed new interactions with mno2 nanorods by replacing the nh and oh functional groups in order to confirm the formation of go chit mno2 nrs hybrid we measured the percentage of chitosan content grafted over the go and the supported mno2 nrs through weight loss between the 200 and 800 c temperature range the tga results depicted in fig 2 showed a significant weight loss of 13 between 120 and 300 c due to the pyrolysis of cooh oh and epoxy groups 29 in the case of pure chitosan two types of weight losses were observed primarily 11 weight loss was noted between 30 and 100 c due to the evaporation of absorbed water followed by 46 of weight loss obtained between 450 and 700 c because of the polysaccharide unit degradation interestingly witnessed a 16 gradual weight loss occurs in go chit material below the temperature of 400 c which is probably due to the loss of glucopyranose ring of the chitosan additionally we observed a decrease in the total weight loss 36 for the go chit sample which revealed the covalent immobilization between go and chitosan through the epoxide and hydroxyl groups of go tga analysis of go chit mno2 nrs composites experienced a gradual weight loss of 6 between 500 and 600 c which may be due to loss of mno2 nrs further raman spectral analysis was performed to identify and characterise the physical and chemical properties of the go chit mno2nrs hybrid the fig 3 illustrates the spectral analysis of a graphite b go chit and c go chit mno2 nrs respectively two major d and g bands for all the samples between 1330 and 1590 cm 1 were clearly visible 17 30 normally the d band in pure graphitic lattice is quite weak or sometimes nearly invisible which arises from the k point phonons of the a1g csp 3 atom first order scattering process while e2g phonons of the csp 2 atom is responsible for the g band arise fig 3a in contrast d band that appeared at 1314 cm 1 for the go chit sample could be linked to the increasing sp3 carbon atoms that arise due to covalent the immobilization of chitosan polymer on the graphene oxide surface 28 moreover a reasonable shift of 25 cm 1 1573 to 1597 cm 1 for the g band in the go chit sample was observed which could be due to the detachment of go layers fig 3b we speculate that the glucopyranose ring of the chitosan is the major reason for the greater intensity of the d band of the go chit sample in the case of mno2 nrs incorporated in go chit different behavior in the lower region 100 1000 cm 1 of the raman spectrum was noted moreover the mno2 nrs dispersed over go chit spectra in fig 3c peak was observed at 350 and 643 cm 1 which belongs to the bending modes of o mn o further go chit mno2 nrs go and pure graphite samples presented d g band ratios of 0 9886 0 9124 and 0 204 respectively the enhanced d g ratio implies that the successful formation of go chit and the surface decorated mno2 nrs was evident we examined sem analysis to confirm the composite structural formation and chemical changes in the surface morphology of grafted graphene oxide and go chit mno2nrs the highly visible thin graphene oxide layers images determine the single layer of go formation fig 4a 25 in contrast a randomly mixed rope like structure was noticed in the go chit fig 4b which depicts the successful grafting of a chitosan polymer over go the surface morphology of go chit mno2nrs revealed the distribution of nanorods over the go chit functionalized structure indicating the highly decorated and dispersed of mno2 nanorods and their uniform distribution over the go chit surface fig 4c and si fig s2 tem analysis was performed to further confirm the morphology and size of the go chit mno2 nrs fig 5 fig 5 a b tem images revealed the finest rod like structures with uniform size formed by the manganese oxide nanoparticles furthermore the tem images confirmed the formation of go chit stabilized mno2nrs that are uniformly distributed on the go chit surfaces with sizes of 700 nm length and 15 5 nm width fig 5c and d the detailed tem images of the go go chit mno2nrs and go chit stabilized of mno2nrs are presented in figs s3 s5 the xps spectra of the go chit mno2 nanohybrids in fig 6 provide further insight into the oxidation state of the elemental composition the c1s xps spectra of the go chit mno2 nanohybrid sample consist of sp2 sp3 and o c o bands in the range of 283 1 291 2 and 295 1 ev respectively 16 a strong band observed at 281 1 ev indicates sp2 carbon atom majorly presented in the nanohybrid moderate xps peak appeared at 291 2 ev and 295 1 ev indicates successful insertion of sp3 carbon atom and formation of o c o functional group in the nanocomposites further mno2nrs incorporation on the go chit network can be confirmed through the o 1s and mn 2p xps characteristic peak fig 6b c metal oxygen o 1s peak mno at 529 1 ev and 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 states of mn 2p characteristics peaks at 641 1 and 654 2 ev respectively indicates that the mno2nrs are presented in the material fig 6b 23 additionally the survey spectrum of go chit mno2 nanohybrid indicated that the synthesised material consists of c n o and mn elements fig s6 the xps spectrum results clearly screen the successful formation of go chit mno2 nanohybrid composites the n2 sorption isotherms of go go chit and go chit mno2nrs are shown in fig 7 and corresponding textural properties are summarized in table 1 the type iv isotherm iupac classifications with h1 hysteresis loop was observed for all the samples in the fig 7 the go chit and go chit mno2nrs powder showed the highest pore volume than the go and mno2nrs samples indicates go chit and go chit mno2nrs samples has highest surface area pore volume and pore size than the go and mno2nrs 17 18 in order to investigate the differences in adsorption of ionic dyes of various go go chit go chit mno2nrs hybrids the basic strengths of the hybrid materials were determined by the temperature programmed desorption of co2 co2 tpd and the results are shown in fig s7 values are summarized in table s1 from which it can be seen that the pure go showed a desorption peak at 534 and 687 c corresponding to 0 36 and 2 48 mmol co2 desorbed respectively in the case of go chit mno2nrs shows two peaks at 293 and 655 c attributed to the 15 13 mmol and 9 78 mmol of co2 desorption respectively it is well known that nh2 groups of chitosan impart basicity as well as being involved in specific interactions with metal oxide in the present case may be interaction of mno2 with oh and nh2 groups of chitosan on the go surface is responsible for the basicity of the go chit mno2nrs hybrid hence go chit mno2nrs showed higher basicity than that of go chit and go 31 3 2 application of ab and mb ionic dye removal using go chit mno2nrs since the synthesised go chit mno2nrs hybrid material shows attractive adsorption behaviors towards mb and ab toxic ionic organic industrial dyes experiments have been done for successful removal of cationic mb and anionic ab organic dyes by simple adsorption method the dye removal experiments were carried out for mb and ab in aqueous solutions by uv vis spectroscopy with go chit mno2nrs hybrid under the absence of external reducing or oxidizing agent or sunlight at room temperature for different time durations the main absorption peaks were found for ab and mb dyes at 610 nm and 660 nm respectively fig 8a b 1 we found that the dyes are stable and do not undergo any chemical physical changes or changes in absorbance by themselves in the presence absence of light however the absorbance of these dyes decreased drastically in the presence of go chit mno2 nrs and it became near to zero in about 700 min and 24 min for ab and mb respectively removal of dye was confirmed through the appearance of complete colorless solution and the absence of absorbance peak in the spectrum additionally we have carried out several attempts to compare the adsorption activity of prepared catalysts with pure graphite go bare mno2nrs and mno2 p separately and we could not observe any changes in the absorbance for above mentioned samples the adsorption ability of bare mno2 i e without go chit shown low adsorption capacity below 5 fig s8 hence the enhanced adsorption activity of go chit α mno2nrs composites in the removal of cationic dyes mb is attributed to the synergic effect due to the presence of both go chit and mno2nrs material besides the re usability experiment of the go chit α mno2 nrs hybrid for the dye removal was investigated additionally systematic adsorption kinetics was also examined to have a better understanding towards the adsorption phenomena it can be further confirmed by ft ir spectroscopy through the appearance of appropriate stretching frequency of corresponding adsorbed ionic dyes fig 12 it designates that a strong electrostatic interaction is required for the adsorption of dyes on the surface of go chit mno2nrs we found that the shape and size of the mno2 nanoparticles plays a vital role in the dye adsorption process the adsorption capability of the synthesised nanohybrid might have the possibility to contribute to the various interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate in adsorption phenomenon the schematic representation of adsorption mechanism of ab and mb dyes on the go chit mno2 nrs is presented in fig 8 the adsorption phenomenon between go chit mno2nrs hybrid and ionic dye substrate can be summarized as follows i mno2nrs negatively charged mno2nrs has the strong electrostatic attraction with positively charged mb resulting in the enhanced adsorption towards cationic dyes ii higher surface area of the graphene oxide helps to adsorb a greater number of ionic dye molecules additionally π π stacking interactions between bulk π system of sp2 carbon graphene oxide helps to bring the dye molecules near to the go chit mno2nrs iii strong hydrogen bonding between the chitosan and dye molecule is mediated through the oh and nh group of chitosan substrate furthermore the adsorbed dyes could not be leached with alcoholic or other organic solvents after adsorption which indicates that the adsorption was very strong 3 3 systematic adsorption kinetics studies to validate the efficiency of the adsorbent go chit mno2nrs ability initial concentrations of mb and ab 10 b dyes were evaluated to the adsorption experiments 7 12 go chit mno2nrs adsorption capacity increases 16 66 to 320 mg g 1 table s2 with the initial concentration of mb dye increases from 10 to 300 mg l 1 while the efficiency of dye removal is decreased greater than 95 dye removal efficiency was obtained up to c0 100 mg l 1 initial concentration and it degreased dramatically to 75 at the c0 200 mg l 1 initial concentration table s2 in contrast in the case of initial concentration 300 mg l 1 mb dye removal efficiency drastically decreased in to 64 at that time the adsorption capacity was 320 mg g 1 table s2 details of the dye removal efficiency and adsorption capacity as a function of initial concentration were presented in table s2 noticed rapid mb dye removal process was occurred with the addition of low initial c0 10 mg l 1 concentration go chit mno2nrs material was rapidly removed mb dye within 25 s therefore adsorption kinetic experiments were conducted with higher mb initial concentration above 30 mg l 1 to validate the time dependent adsorption phenomenon thus the above results designate go chit mno2nrs material effectively removed mb dye from the dye solution additionally the ph effect of adsorption of mb on go chit mno2nrs material was carried out in aqueous solution because of ph nature effectively affecting the dye adsorption phenomenon 5 mb adsorption capacity on the go chit mno2nrs hybrid material increases 109 1 to 164 mg g 1 with increase in ph from 2 to 12 at 30 mg l 1 mb initial concentration fig s9 dependence of adsorption ability has been investigated with the two initial concentrations of 30 and 100 mg l 1 methylene blue and amido black 10 b dye solution with function of contact time fig 9 it is evident that the increased equilibrium adsorption with the initial concentration of dyes was observed fig 9a further mb dye was rapidly adsorbed on the go chit mno2nrs hybrid at the initial stage within 25 min and then gradually reached equilibrium this result suggests that the go chit mno2nrs hybrid contains higher number of active sites in the initial adsorption there after active sites declined with steric hindrance 32 33 in the case of ab10 anionic dye equilibrium adsorption reaches after 800 min at that time adsorption capacity reaches 40 120 mg g 1 for the 30 and 100 mg l 1 initial concentration with declined dye removal efficiency from 81 to 72 fig 9 b in contrast drastically declined in ab10 dye removal efficiency to 28 with initial concentration 300 mg l 1 at that time adsorption capacity 140 mg g 1 the results indicate that the prepared go chit mno2nrs materials are more suitable for the adsorption of cationic mb dyes than the anionic ab10 in order to further understand the mb adsorption phenomenon on go chit mno2nrs hybrid we further examined the adsorption kinetics the measured mb dye adsorbed experimental kinetics values were fitted with two linear forms of pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso kinetics model respectively 34 37 the fig 10 shows mb dye adsorption kinetics model of a pseudo first order pfo plot between log qe qt vs contact time t b pseudo second order pso plot between t qt vs contact time t fig 10 c d shows langmuir equilibrium adsorption isotherm kinetic models homogenous monolayer and freundlich equilibrium adsorption isotherm kinetic models heterogeneous multilayer respectively qt and qe corresponds to adsorption capacities mg g 1 at contact time t min and equilibrium respectively for the mb dye adsorption the k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 represents are the rate constants at the equilibrium for the pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso kinetic model respectively k1 and k2 were determined from the slope and intercept values of log qe qt vs t and t qt vs t respectively fig 10a b correlation coefficient r2 and rate constants k1 and k2 values observed for the pfo model r2 0 9884 k1 0 0541 and for pso model r2 0 9978 k2 0 02142 respectively when compare the two models the correlation coefficient r2 values evidently indicate the adsorption of mb on go chit mno2nrs hybrid materials mainly follows pso model through the rate limiting step connecting chemisorption between the adsorbent and adsorbate 38 39 though it is difficult to decide the diffusion mechanism by using above mentioned two kinetic models further in order to examine the sorption study we utilized linear form of interparticle diffusion method of weber and morris kinetic model with 30 mg l 1 mb initial concentration fig s10 40 41 it can be seen in fig s10 two linear portions it is suggesting that the mb adsorption can be explained by two stage process i stage one is mb adsorption on external surface i e occurring mass transfer via boundary layer diffusion it can be confirmed through the appearing first stage steep slope in fig s10 and ii the step by step sorption stage also called interparticle diffusion it is evidently confirmed with appearing plateau slopes at the second stage fig s10 41 results of interparticle diffusion methods clearly indicates mb adsorption process rapidly occur at the initial stage followed by gradually attained their equilibrium 38 3 c e q e c e q max 1 b q e 4 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e the systematic adsorption isotherm kinetics studies provide detailed of the efficient adsorption behavior through obtained parameters basis hence the linear form of langmuir and freundlich equilibrium adsorption isotherm model further applied to find out the equilibrium adsorption isotherm phenomenon linear form of langmuir and freundlich isotherm model describes in eqs 3 and 4 respectively here ce and qe represents dye concentration at equilibrium mg l 1 and adsorption capacity at equilibrium mg g 1 respectively b represents langmuir constant and qmax is belongs to langmuir theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent in monolayer adsorption qmax and b values measured through the obtained the slope and intercept values from linier plot between ce qe vs ce kf is the freundlich constant mg g 1 1 n is heterogeneity parameter langmuir equilibrium adsorption isotherm model is based on the theory of monolayer adsorption by homogenous adsorbent surface 42 44 in contrast freundlich adsorption isotherm model is based on the theory of multilayer adsorption on the heterogeneous adsorbent surface 42 the fig 10 c d demonstrates linear form of monolayer langmuir and multilayer freundlich adsorption models of the mb dye adsorption using go chit mno2nrs the obtained r2 values from the langmuir r2 0 9945 k 0 00304 and freundlich r2 0 8115 k 0 871 isotherm model clearly indicates the highest regression correlation of r2 value suggests mb adsorption process mainly occurs through the homogenous monolayer langmuir adsorption results suggest langmuir equation can be used to calculate the maximum adsorption capacity qmax the measured theoretical qmax value is approximately 328 9 mg g 1 this value is almost similar to experimentally obtained value 320 mg g 1 similarly we calculated theoretical qmax value for the ab anionic dye adsorption on go chit mno2nrs materials is 150 6 mg g 1 and almost close to experimentally obtained value of 140 mg g 1 fig s11 as a result indicates that the maximum adsorption capacity value for ab dye adsorption is 2 18 times lower than that of mb adsorption maximum value we compared adsorption capacity of our synthesised go chit mno2nrs materials with other adsorbents including metal oxide carbon and metal oxide carbon composites with existing literature table 2 our material shows better adsorption capacity than the existing literatures especially for mb cationic dye removal system it can be used as a promising adsorbent material for the cationic dye removal application 3 4 effect of foreign ions in order to find out the effect of foreign ions on the adsorption of mb over go chit mno2nrs hybrid we carried out mb dye removal experiments in the presence of 0 01 mol l kcl nacl and licl as a function of ph fig 11 a fig 11 a shows mb removal efficiency is lower in kcl solution than that of licl and nacl with the ph range of 2 to 12 cations could influence the surface properties of go chit mno2nrs material results changes in the dye removal efficiency the major reason for the lowest mb dye removal in kcl solution k has smaller hydration radios than that of na 2 76 å and li 3 40 å 5 further the k ions have highest affinity towards the go chit mno2nrs surface this tendency is the reasons for counter ion exchange oxygen containing groups on the go chit mno2nrs surface which lead to diminish the active interaction sites on the go chit mno2nrs surface 55 furthermore the removal efficiency of mb dye drastically affected by the addition of foreign anions due to competitive adsorption fig 11b interestingly different phenomenon was observed with the addition of kno3 kclo4 anions in the mb dye removal removal efficacy of mb was found to be higher in kno3 and kclo4 solutions than that of kcl solution it may be due to these major reasons 1 radius order of the inorganic acid radical cl no3 clo4 56 inorganic acid with smaller radius can occupy the higher ionic exchange sites results degrease the removal efficiency of go chit mno2nrs ii further cl was easily captured by the hydroxyl or amino groups on the go chit mno2nrs surface it may be the reason to reduce the binding sites availability 5 iii in the case of kclo4 solution dye removal efficiency is not depends on the initial ph of the solution in aqueous solution mb easily react with clo4 by complexation appears with light green color results in the efficacy of mb adsorption are enhanced in go chit mno2nrs 38 3 5 recyclability of go chit mno2nrs in order to make the synthesised go chit mno2nrs hybrid materials to be suitable for practical and industrial applications we carried out the recyclability test after every dye removal adsorption kinetic experiment the adsorbent was recovered by centrifugation at 6000 rpm followed by washing with distilled water and ethanol the recyclability experiment was conducted by measuring the uv absorbance of every cycle after the complete removal of dyes the experiment confirmed that the developed material was found to be an active even after 10 successive cycles nevertheless after the fifth cycle the effectiveness of the material reduced minimally which is attributed due to the minor leaching of mno2nrs similarly recycle experiment performed in ab dye revealed that the go chit mno2nrs nanohybrid can be effectively employed as an adsorbent material at least for 10 times without noteworthy loss in its dye removal activity fig s12 3 6 characteristics discussion of adsorption of go chit mno2nrs towards ab and mb ionic dyes the upcoming characteristic discussions express that the successful formation of go chit and their supported mno2nrs the versatile nature of the go chit mno2nrs hybrid will bring about physical and chemical transformations on interaction with the potential substrate henceforth we examined the efficiency of the synthesised go chit mno2nrs hybrid towards the adsorption of various ionic dyes to investigate the physical adsorption properties of the adsorbed mb and ab organic dyes over go chit mno2nrs ft ir investigation was performed after the adsorption process go chit mno2nrs hybrid material was removed carefully using an easy filtration technique and followed by five times constant washing with distilled water and then dried under vacuum at 50 c we noticed in the ft ir spectra after the ab dye adsorption process the new n n azo bond and sulfonate group so3 stretching vibrational peaks appeared at 1604 cm 1 and 1030 cm 1 respectively fig 12b similarly the typical no2 functional group vibration bands of the ab dye appeared at 1662 and 1510 cm 1 interestingly strong physical adsorption through the valuable red shift in the nh2 vibration after ab adsorption 3423 cm 1 is shifted to 3351 cm 1 was observed 25 the successful removal of mb adsorption was confirmed using ft ir investigation fig 12c mb adsorbed go chit mno2nrs material exhibited four strong stretching vibrational ft ir peak for 3 amine at 1231 for n n at 1220 for s at 1226 and for quaternary 4 amine at 2924 cm 1 respectively ft ir results of newly appearing characteristic peak of adsorbed mb and ab dye and their notable nh2 peak shift in the stretching vibration denotes that all the dyes are completely adsorbed on the go chit mno2nrs hybrid system 4 conclusions industrial toxic dyes are polluting aquatic environments and have serious health effects in this work we successfully synthesised and designed mno2 nanorods nrs decorated on chitosan grafted graphene oxide mno2nrs go chit hybrid material which is an effective adsorbent in removal of cationic methylene blue mb and anionic amido black 10 ab10 dyes from xrd it is confirmed the formation of single layer go and the semi crystalline go chit mno2 nrs composite structure from the characterisation results it is evident that the oxygen containing functional groups were exist over the go chit surface which lead to π π interactions and reactive defect sites for mno2 nrs moreover after the incorporation of mno2 surface basicity improved significantly and lead to high adsorption capacity towards ionic dyes both dyes are completely removed from the solution however the removal of cationic dye mb took 24 min i e 29 times much faster absorbance time than anionic ab10 dye 700 min for the complete adsorption the synergistic effects of mno2 and go chit exhibited stronger electrostatic attractions towards cationic mb than anionic dyes at c0 100 mg l 1 higher than 95 dye removal efficiency with maximum capacity of qmax 329 mg g 1 was achieved at higher ph value i e in basic nature a maximum adsorption capacity can be achieved from the adsorption kinetic and isotherm models mb adsorption over mno2nrs go chit hybrid material follows pseudo second order pso kinetic model and homogenous monolayer langmuir adsorption finally mno2nrs go chit hybrid material found to be highly stable after 10 successive adsorption cycles and promising candidate to develop further for full commercialisation declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgements we acknowledge

13019,in this study we designed a heterogeneous graphene oxide go grafted on chitosan decorated with mno2 nanorods α mno2nrs go chit composite materials and its ability to remove the cationic and anionic toxic dyes from wastewaters were analysed the synthesised materials presented an effective stabilization of active mno2 nanorods nrs on the go chit surface the synthesised materials were detailed characterised by several spectroscopic and microscopic techniques such as ft ir p xrd sem tem raman tga xps bet co2 tpd and uv visible analysis in addition α mno2nrs go chit material is successfully applied in removal of industrial ionic dyes such as amido black 10b ab and methylene blue mb respectively the dye adsorption experiments confirmed that the go chit α mno2 nrs material exhibited remarkably high adsorption capacity in efficient removal of cationic dye methylene blue mb and anionic dye amido black 10b ab the maximum mb dye removal 97 process completed in 24 min at c0 30 mg l 1 but in the case of ab the maximum dye removal 80 process was reached in 700 min over go chit α mno2 nrs hybrid material a maximum theoretical monolayer adsorption qmax values is 328 9 mg g 1 of mb was calculated from the langmuir isotherm equation in case mb a faster adsorption and 2 18 times maximum adsorption capacity was achieved than that of ab10 dye the enhanced adsorption over α mno2nrs go chit is due to the increased surface functionalities i e oxygen containing groups high basicity and strong electrostatic forces between mno2 nanorods and go chit furthermore α mno2nrs go chit hybrid material displayed good stability after 10 successive adsorption tests graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene oxide chitosan mno2 nanorods wastewater adsorption ionic dyes 1 introduction dyes are the most significant chemical substances that have been extensively used in textile printing dyeing and paper industries the industrial dyes are commonly classified as cationic all basic dyes anionic reactive acid and direct dyes or non ionic dispersed dyes further the basic and reactive dyes are the most preferred ones owing to their better properties and favorable characteristics such as water solubility bright coloration less expensive and easy fabrication 1 5 these toxic ionic dyes remain unaffected when treated conventionally because of their structural complexity and synthetic origin the toxic ionic dyes released into water streams from textile industries are carcinogenic hazardous mutagenic and can cause serious threat to the aqueous environments 6 9 typically these toxic dyes can be found in small traces in industrial waste waters thus there is a need an efficient and easy method to remove these dyes from the wastewaters and possess a big challenge for the scientific community to develop and design a promising method and material industrial wastewater treatment plants are equipped with many process steps such as flocculation coagulation and precipitation for reducing the effluent harmful compounds moreover the emerging technologies such as photo biological and electrochemical dye degradation were also reported however the adsorption method is widely used technique highly feasible economical and effective in dye removal from aqueous streams the photocatalytic biological and electrochemical dye degradation has its limitations and disadvantages than adsorption method 2 3 8 over the past few decades carbon based hybrid adsorbent systems such as metal and metal oxides or mixed oxides based carbon composites have attracted significant attention in the removal of industrial dyes researchers reported that the graphene oxide go activated carbon ac graphene mesoporous carbon and carbon nanotubes cnts have been stacked and functionalized with various inorganic compounds metal oxides and metal nanoparticles 10 15 to exhibit better adsorption performance and stability moreover many different methods introduced to design a composite based material to have better conductivity higher surface area mechanical and thermal stability graphene oxide go has emerged as a promising and versatile material owing to its outstanding physicochemical properties such as porous structure tunable structure high surface area and high specific reactivity 16 17 moreover graphene oxide can be modified functionalized or pretreated to change its morphological or structural changes based on the application for example go can be functionalized with abundant functional groups such as epoxy hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups in providing multiple roles and functionalities of go for the utilization in desired applications functionalized go provides an exceptional support for docking the catalytic agent for surface chemical reactions further these materials trestle with substrate molecules via various bonding interactions like hydrogen hydrophobic electrostatic interactions and π π stretching for stimulating and activating the groups over the substrate and proximity to the catalysts 18 functionalized graphene sheets have enhanced the encapsulating efficiency as the go sheets possess more active surface area thereby improving the increased accessibility to the substrate molecules the incorporation of a moderately minimal number of nanoparticles over the go sheets was exhibited due to limitation in surface oxygen functionalities thus this surface limitations can be overcome by grafting the polymer structure onto the surface of go thereby proliferating the encapsulation or functionalized sites for metal or metal oxide nanoparticles 18 hence the primary goal was to graft chitosan with appropriate functional groups such as nh2 oh groups onto the graphene oxide substrate to increase the adsorptive sites one of the most abundant adsorbents is the manganese dioxide mno2 which has been contemplated as the potent adsorbent because of its environmental benign cost effectiveness and abundance 19 moreover it is known and highly applicable as a promising adsorbent such as in adsorption of heavy metals and methylene blue cationic pollutants owing to its negatively charged surface 20 21 additionally in an aquatic environment mno2 nanoparticles have better self aggregating properties with various ionic organic and inorganic pollutants 22 in this work we successfully designed novel mno2 nanorods decorated on graphene oxide grafted chitosan composite system in removal of toxic ionic industrial dyes for environmentally friendly method for comparison the dye removal ability of bare mno2 samples both commercial ones and lab synthesised mno2 nrs were also tested 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals sulfuric acid potassium permanganate sodium nitrate sodium hydroxide hydrogen peroxide manganese sulfate monohydrate chitosan amido black 10b ab and methylene blue mb were purchased from merck india graphite the particle size of 150 μm was obtained from sigma aldrich india 2 2 grafting chitosan polymer on the graphene oxide surface go chit graphene oxide go was prepared using a reported procedure of hummers and offeman s method 18 with minor modifications in a typical reaction 1 g of graphite 1 g of nano3 and 50 ml of h2so4 were stirred together in an ice bath kmno4 3 g was slowly added to the stirring mixture and the rate of addition was controlled to prevent the temperature of reaction vessel from exceeding 20 c the mixture was then transferred in to a 35 c water bath and stirred for 1 h resulting in the formation of a thick paste subsequently 50 ml of deionized water was added slowly resulting in an increase in temperature to 98 c after 15 min the mixture was further treated with 150 ml deionized water and 10 ml of 30 h2o2 solution the warm solution was filtered and then washed with deionized water until a ph of 7 is reached and then the synthesised go was dried at 65 c under vacuum scheme 1 graphene oxide 0 5 g was dispersed in socl2 30 ml and stirred for 24 h at 70 c the resultant acylated go was collected by filtration and washed with tetrahydrofuran thf and the final product go cocl 0 495 g was dried under vacuum for 24 h at room temperature the acylated graphene oxide 0 5 g was first dispersed in 20 ml water using an ultrasonic bath for 1 h the reaction mixture was then shifted to 20 ml of 2 acetic acid containing 1 g of chitosan the resultant mixture was further allowed to stir at room temperature for 24 h the final go chit solution was filtered and then cleaned with de ionized water the filtered product was dried over night at 65 c under vacuum conditions 2 3 preparation of mno2 nanorods the α mno2 nanorods were synthesised according to the method reported by weidong he method 23 initially 0 000624 mol 0 1055 g of manganese sulfate

the crystalline properties of the synthesised go go chit and go chit α mno2nrs were analysed by using an x ray diffractometer xrd panalytical s x pert pro employing cu kα radiation by obtained xrd patterns the covalent successful functionalization of the prepared materials was further confirmed using fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy nicolet 6700 ft ir spectrometer through the kbr method the raman spectra of the prepared go chit α mno2 nrs were determined by witec confocal raman instrument crm200 with ar ion laser λ 514 5 nm the complete surface morphology changes of the synthesised go chit α mno2nrs were studied by scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 3400n model the transmission electron microscope tem images were captured with a tecnai f 30 instrument at high resolution additionally thermal analyzer tg dta q 600 sdt was used to confirm the formation of go chit and go chit α mno2nrs composites and the thermal analysis were analysed the adsorption kinetics of the dyes were studied by recording the absorption spectrums using ocean optics hr4000 spectrophotometer at different time intervals the surface area of all the samples was determined by bet method using quantachrome instrument the temperature programmed desorption of co2 studies was also conducted on auto chem 2910 micromeritics usa instrument 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of go chit supported mno2nrs go chit mno2nrs in fig 1 a b shown the xrd patterns of graphite gr and graphene oxide go the appearance of a new diffraction peak at 12 5 and the disappearance of diffraction pattern at 26 4 indicates the successful formation of single layer graphene oxide go jcpds 75 2078 with oxygen functionalities fig 1b additionally chitosan grafting phase can be seen in fig 1c through the appearance of semi crystalline chitosan polymer diffraction peaks at 2θ 20 1 47 6 54 3 and 77 6 the xrd patterns described in fig 1d attributed to the complete phase formation of go chit mno2 nrs composite structure the peaks at 2θ values of 12 9 18 1 28 9 38 42 1 49 8 56 3 60 1 and 69 7 indicates the α mno2 jcpds 440141 representing the pure phase of α mno2 19 23 further characterised by ftir analysis to confirm the go formation chitosan grafting and decorated mno2 nanorods nrs over go chit scaffold it is evident that the formation of go from fig s1 b through the reflections of various types of oxygen based functionalities over the surface of go was evident through the appearance of oh stretching vibrations at 3422 cm 1 co stretching vibration at 1725 cm 1 unoxidized graphite domains cc at 1666 cm 1 c oh stretching vibrations at 1220 cm 1 and stretching vibrations for co at 1060 cm 1 respectively 24 in contrast fig s1 a doesn t show any peaks related to the bending and stretching vibrations of pure graphite due to absence of surface functionalities nevertheless only one vibrational peak is visible for graphitic aromatic benzene at 1666 cm 1 25 confirmative ft ir peaks are noticed for acyl group functionalized graphene oxide go cocl as shown in fig s1 c moreover the introduction of a new peak at 694 cm 1 along with co peak shift at 1694 cm 1 and the complete disappearance of oh stretching vibration at 3435 cm 1 was evident due to the construction of new ccl bond formation 26 27 the covalent immobilization of chitosan on to the go was further confirmed in fig s1 d through the appearance of conh amide bond peak at 1645 cm 1 ch2 aliphatic peak at 2095 cm 1 and the free nh and oh peaks of the chitosan polymer appearing at 3480 cm 1 28 additionally the stabilization of mno2nrs on the go chit can be seen in fig s1 e the disappearance of nh and oh stretching vibrations at 3480 cm 1 is due to decomposition and creation of defect sites which formed new interactions with mno2 nanorods by replacing the nh and oh functional groups in order to confirm the formation of go chit mno2 nrs hybrid we measured the percentage of chitosan content grafted over the go and the supported mno2 nrs through weight loss between the 200 and 800 c temperature range the tga results depicted in fig 2 showed a significant weight loss of 13 between 120 and 300 c due to the pyrolysis of cooh oh and epoxy groups 29 in the case of pure chitosan two types of weight losses were observed primarily 11 weight loss was noted between 30 and 100 c due to the evaporation of absorbed water followed by 46 of weight loss obtained between 450 and 700 c because of the polysaccharide unit degradation interestingly witnessed a 16 gradual weight loss occurs in go chit material below the temperature of 400 c which is probably due to the loss of glucopyranose ring of the chitosan additionally we observed a decrease in the total weight loss 36 for the go chit sample which revealed the covalent immobilization between go and chitosan through the epoxide and hydroxyl groups of go tga analysis of go chit mno2 nrs composites experienced a gradual weight loss of 6 between 500 and 600 c which may be due to loss of mno2 nrs further raman spectral analysis was performed to identify and characterise the physical and chemical properties of the go chit mno2nrs hybrid the fig 3 illustrates the spectral analysis of a graphite b go chit and c go chit mno2 nrs respectively two major d and g bands for all the samples between 1330 and 1590 cm 1 were clearly visible 17 30 normally the d band in pure graphitic lattice is quite weak or sometimes nearly invisible which arises from the k point phonons of the a1g csp 3 atom first order scattering process while e2g phonons of the csp 2 atom is responsible for the g band arise fig 3a in contrast d band that appeared at 1314 cm 1 for the go chit sample could be linked to the increasing sp3 carbon atoms that arise due to covalent the immobilization of chitosan polymer on the graphene oxide surface 28 moreover a reasonable shift of 25 cm 1 1573 to 1597 cm 1 for the g band in the go chit sample was observed which could be due to the detachment of go layers fig 3b we speculate that the glucopyranose ring of the chitosan is the major reason for the greater intensity of the d band of the go chit sample in the case of mno2 nrs incorporated in go chit different behavior in the lower region 100 1000 cm 1 of the raman spectrum was noted moreover the mno2 nrs dispersed over go chit spectra in fig 3c peak was observed at 350 and 643 cm 1 which belongs to the bending modes of o mn o further go chit mno2 nrs go and pure graphite samples presented d g band ratios of 0 9886 0 9124 and 0 204 respectively the enhanced d g ratio implies that the successful formation of go chit and the surface decorated mno2 nrs was evident we examined sem analysis to confirm the composite structural formation and chemical changes in the surface morphology of grafted graphene oxide and go chit mno2nrs the highly visible thin graphene oxide layers images determine the single layer of go formation fig 4a 25 in contrast a randomly mixed rope like structure was noticed in the go chit fig 4b which depicts the successful grafting of a chitosan polymer over go the surface morphology of go chit mno2nrs revealed the distribution of nanorods over the go chit functionalized structure indicating the highly decorated and dispersed of mno2 nanorods and their uniform distribution over the go chit surface fig 4c and si fig s2 tem analysis was performed to further confirm the morphology and size of the go chit mno2 nrs fig 5 fig 5 a b tem images revealed the finest rod like structures with uniform size formed by the manganese oxide nanoparticles furthermore the tem images confirmed the formation of go chit stabilized mno2nrs that are uniformly distributed on the go chit surfaces with sizes of 700 nm length and 15 5 nm width fig 5c and d the detailed tem images of the go go chit mno2nrs and go chit stabilized of mno2nrs are presented in figs s3 s5 the xps spectra of the go chit mno2 nanohybrids in fig 6 provide further insight into the oxidation state of the elemental composition the c1s xps spectra of the go chit mno2 nanohybrid sample consist of sp2 sp3 and o c o bands in the range of 283 1 291 2 and 295 1 ev respectively 16 a strong band observed at 281 1 ev indicates sp2 carbon atom majorly presented in the nanohybrid moderate xps peak appeared at 291 2 ev and 295 1 ev indicates successful insertion of sp3 carbon atom and formation of o c o functional group in the nanocomposites further mno2nrs incorporation on the go chit network can be confirmed through the o 1s and mn 2p xps characteristic peak fig 6b c metal oxygen o 1s peak mno at 529 1 ev and 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 states of mn 2p characteristics peaks at 641 1 and 654 2 ev respectively indicates that the mno2nrs are presented in the material fig 6b 23 additionally the survey spectrum of go chit mno2 nanohybrid indicated that the synthesised material consists of c n o and mn elements fig s6 the xps spectrum results clearly screen the successful formation of go chit mno2 nanohybrid composites the n2 sorption isotherms of go go chit and go chit mno2nrs are shown in fig 7 and corresponding textural properties are summarized in table 1 the type iv isotherm iupac classifications with h1 hysteresis loop was observed for all the samples in the fig 7 the go chit and go chit mno2nrs powder showed the highest pore volume than the go and mno2nrs samples indicates go chit and go chit mno2nrs samples has highest surface area pore volume and pore size than the go and mno2nrs 17 18 in order to investigate the differences in adsorption of ionic dyes of various go go chit go chit mno2nrs hybrids the basic strengths of the hybrid materials were determined by the temperature programmed desorption of co2 co2 tpd and the results are shown in fig s7 values are summarized in table s1 from which it can be seen that the pure go showed a desorption peak at 534 and 687 c corresponding to 0 36 and 2 48 mmol co2 desorbed respectively in the case of go chit mno2nrs shows two peaks at 293 and 655 c attributed to the 15 13 mmol and 9 78 mmol of co2 desorption respectively it is well known that nh2 groups of chitosan impart basicity as well as being involved in specific interactions with metal oxide in the present case may be interaction of mno2 with oh and nh2 groups of chitosan on the go surface is responsible for the basicity of the go chit mno2nrs hybrid hence go chit mno2nrs showed higher basicity than that of go chit and go 31 3 2 application of ab and mb ionic dye removal using go chit mno2nrs since the synthesised go chit mno2nrs hybrid material shows attractive adsorption behaviors towards mb and ab toxic ionic organic industrial dyes experiments have been done for successful removal of cationic mb and anionic ab organic dyes by simple adsorption method the dye removal experiments were carried out for mb and ab in aqueous solutions by uv vis spectroscopy with go chit mno2nrs hybrid under the absence of external reducing or oxidizing agent or sunlight at room temperature for different time durations the main absorption peaks were found for ab and mb dyes at 610 nm and 660 nm respectively fig 8a b 1 we found that the dyes are stable and do not undergo any chemical physical changes or changes in absorbance by themselves in the presence absence of light however the absorbance of these dyes decreased drastically in the presence of go chit mno2 nrs and it became near to zero in about 700 min and 24 min for ab and mb respectively removal of dye was confirmed through the appearance of complete colorless solution and the absence of absorbance peak in the spectrum additionally we have carried out several attempts to compare the adsorption activity of prepared catalysts with pure graphite go bare mno2nrs and mno2 p separately and we could not observe any changes in the absorbance for above mentioned samples the adsorption ability of bare mno2 i e without go chit shown low adsorption capacity below 5 fig s8 hence the enhanced adsorption activity of go chit α mno2nrs composites in the removal of cationic dyes mb is attributed to the synergic effect due to the presence of both go chit and mno2nrs material besides the re usability experiment of the go chit α mno2 nrs hybrid for the dye removal was investigated additionally systematic adsorption kinetics was also examined to have a better understanding towards the adsorption phenomena it can be further confirmed by ft ir spectroscopy through the appearance of appropriate stretching frequency of corresponding adsorbed ionic dyes fig 12 it designates that a strong electrostatic interaction is required for the adsorption of dyes on the surface of go chit mno2nrs we found that the shape and size of the mno2 nanoparticles plays a vital role in the dye adsorption process the adsorption capability of the synthesised nanohybrid might have the possibility to contribute to the various interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate in adsorption phenomenon the schematic representation of adsorption mechanism of ab and mb dyes on the go chit mno2 nrs is presented in fig 8 the adsorption phenomenon between go chit mno2nrs hybrid and ionic dye substrate can be summarized as follows i mno2nrs negatively charged mno2nrs has the strong electrostatic attraction with positively charged mb resulting in the enhanced adsorption towards cationic dyes ii higher surface area of the graphene oxide helps to adsorb a greater number of ionic dye molecules additionally π π stacking interactions between bulk π system of sp2 carbon graphene oxide helps to bring the dye molecules near to the go chit mno2nrs iii strong hydrogen bonding between the chitosan and dye molecule is mediated through the oh and nh group of chitosan substrate furthermore the adsorbed dyes could not be leached with alcoholic or other organic solvents after adsorption which indicates that the adsorption was very strong 3 3 systematic adsorption kinetics studies to validate the efficiency of the adsorbent go chit mno2nrs ability initial concentrations of mb and ab 10 b dyes were evaluated to the adsorption experiments 7 12 go chit mno2nrs adsorption capacity increases 16 66 to 320 mg g 1 table s2 with the initial concentration of mb dye increases from 10 to 300 mg l 1 while the efficiency of dye removal is decreased greater than 95 dye removal efficiency was obtained up to c0 100 mg l 1 initial concentration and it degreased dramatically to 75 at the c0 200 mg l 1 initial concentration table s2 in contrast in the case of initial concentration 300 mg l 1 mb dye removal efficiency drastically decreased in to 64 at that time the adsorption capacity was 320 mg g 1 table s2 details of the dye removal efficiency and adsorption capacity as a function of initial concentration were presented in table s2 noticed rapid mb dye removal process was occurred with the addition of low initial c0 10 mg l 1 concentration go chit mno2nrs material was rapidly removed mb dye within 25 s therefore adsorption kinetic experiments were conducted with higher mb initial concentration above 30 mg l 1 to validate the time dependent adsorption phenomenon thus the above results designate go chit mno2nrs material effectively removed mb dye from the dye solution additionally the ph effect of adsorption of mb on go chit mno2nrs material was carried out in aqueous solution because of ph nature effectively affecting the dye adsorption phenomenon 5 mb adsorption capacity on the go chit mno2nrs hybrid material increases 109 1 to 164 mg g 1 with increase in ph from 2 to 12 at 30 mg l 1 mb initial concentration fig s9 dependence of adsorption ability has been investigated with the two initial concentrations of 30 and 100 mg l 1 methylene blue and amido black 10 b dye solution with function of contact time fig 9 it is evident that the increased equilibrium adsorption with the initial concentration of dyes was observed fig 9a further mb dye was rapidly adsorbed on the go chit mno2nrs hybrid at the initial stage within 25 min and then gradually reached equilibrium this result suggests that the go chit mno2nrs hybrid contains higher number of active sites in the initial adsorption there after active sites declined with steric hindrance 32 33 in the case of ab10 anionic dye equilibrium adsorption reaches after 800 min at that time adsorption capacity reaches 40 120 mg g 1 for the 30 and 100 mg l 1 initial concentration with declined dye removal efficiency from 81 to 72 fig 9 b in contrast drastically declined in ab10 dye removal efficiency to 28 with initial concentration 300 mg l 1 at that time adsorption capacity 140 mg g 1 the results indicate that the prepared go chit mno2nrs materials are more suitable for the adsorption of cationic mb dyes than the anionic ab10 in order to further understand the mb adsorption phenomenon on go chit mno2nrs hybrid we further examined the adsorption kinetics the measured mb dye adsorbed experimental kinetics values were fitted with two linear forms of pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso kinetics model respectively 34 37 the fig 10 shows mb dye adsorption kinetics model of a pseudo first order pfo plot between log qe qt vs contact time t b pseudo second order pso plot between t qt vs contact time t fig 10 c d shows langmuir equilibrium adsorption isotherm kinetic models homogenous monolayer and freundlich equilibrium adsorption isotherm kinetic models heterogeneous multilayer respectively qt and qe corresponds to adsorption capacities mg g 1 at contact time t min and equilibrium respectively for the mb dye adsorption the k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 represents are the rate constants at the equilibrium for the pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso kinetic model respectively k1 and k2 were determined from the slope and intercept values of log qe qt vs t and t qt vs t respectively fig 10a b correlation coefficient r2 and rate constants k1 and k2 values observed for the pfo model r2 0 9884 k1 0 0541 and for pso model r2 0 9978 k2 0 02142 respectively when compare the two models the correlation coefficient r2 values evidently indicate the adsorption of mb on go chit mno2nrs hybrid materials mainly follows pso model through the rate limiting step connecting chemisorption between the adsorbent and adsorbate 38 39 though it is difficult to decide the diffusion mechanism by using above mentioned two kinetic models further in order to examine the sorption study we utilized linear form of interparticle diffusion method of weber and morris kinetic model with 30 mg l 1 mb initial concentration fig s10 40 41 it can be seen in fig s10 two linear portions it is suggesting that the mb adsorption can be explained by two stage process i stage one is mb adsorption on external surface i e occurring mass transfer via boundary layer diffusion it can be confirmed through the appearing first stage steep slope in fig s10 and ii the step by step sorption stage also called interparticle diffusion it is evidently confirmed with appearing plateau slopes at the second stage fig s10 41 results of interparticle diffusion methods clearly indicates mb adsorption process rapidly occur at the initial stage followed by gradually attained their equilibrium 38 3 c e q e c e q max 1 b q e 4 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e the systematic adsorption isotherm kinetics studies provide detailed of the efficient adsorption behavior through obtained parameters basis hence the linear form of langmuir and freundlich equilibrium adsorption isotherm model further applied to find out the equilibrium adsorption isotherm phenomenon linear form of langmuir and freundlich isotherm model describes in eqs 3 and 4 respectively here ce and qe represents dye concentration at equilibrium mg l 1 and adsorption capacity at equilibrium mg g 1 respectively b represents langmuir constant and qmax is belongs to langmuir theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent in monolayer adsorption qmax and b values measured through the obtained the slope and intercept values from linier plot between ce qe vs ce kf is the freundlich constant mg g 1 1 n is heterogeneity parameter langmuir equilibrium adsorption isotherm model is based on the theory of monolayer adsorption by homogenous adsorbent surface 42 44 in contrast freundlich adsorption isotherm model is based on the theory of multilayer adsorption on the heterogeneous adsorbent surface 42 the fig 10 c d demonstrates linear form of monolayer langmuir and multilayer freundlich adsorption models of the mb dye adsorption using go chit mno2nrs the obtained r2 values from the langmuir r2 0 9945 k 0 00304 and freundlich r2 0 8115 k 0 871 isotherm model clearly indicates the highest regression correlation of r2 value suggests mb adsorption process mainly occurs through the homogenous monolayer langmuir adsorption results suggest langmuir equation can be used to calculate the maximum adsorption capacity qmax the measured theoretical qmax value is approximately 328 9 mg g 1 this value is almost similar to experimentally obtained value 320 mg g 1 similarly we calculated theoretical qmax value for the ab anionic dye adsorption on go chit mno2nrs materials is 150 6 mg g 1 and almost close to experimentally obtained value of 140 mg g 1 fig s11 as a result indicates that the maximum adsorption capacity value for ab dye adsorption is 2 18 times lower than that of mb adsorption maximum value we compared adsorption capacity of our synthesised go chit mno2nrs materials with other adsorbents including metal oxide carbon and metal oxide carbon composites with existing literature table 2 our material shows better adsorption capacity than the existing literatures especially for mb cationic dye removal system it can be used as a promising adsorbent material for the cationic dye removal application 3 4 effect of foreign ions in order to find out the effect of foreign ions on the adsorption of mb over go chit mno2nrs hybrid we carried out mb dye removal experiments in the presence of 0 01 mol l kcl nacl and licl as a function of ph fig 11 a fig 11 a shows mb removal efficiency is lower in kcl solution than that of licl and nacl with the ph range of 2 to 12 cations could influence the surface properties of go chit mno2nrs material results changes in the dye removal efficiency the major reason for the lowest mb dye removal in kcl solution k has smaller hydration radios than that of na 2 76 å and li 3 40 å 5 further the k ions have highest affinity towards the go chit mno2nrs surface this tendency is the reasons for counter ion exchange oxygen containing groups on the go chit mno2nrs surface which lead to diminish the active interaction sites on the go chit mno2nrs surface 55 furthermore the removal efficiency of mb dye drastically affected by the addition of foreign anions due to competitive adsorption fig 11b interestingly different phenomenon was observed with the addition of kno3 kclo4 anions in the mb dye removal removal efficacy of mb was found to be higher in kno3 and kclo4 solutions than that of kcl solution it may be due to these major reasons 1 radius order of the inorganic acid radical cl no3 clo4 56 inorganic acid with smaller radius can occupy the higher ionic exchange sites results degrease the removal efficiency of go chit mno2nrs ii further cl was easily captured by the hydroxyl or amino groups on the go chit mno2nrs surface it may be the reason to reduce the binding sites availability 5 iii in the case of kclo4 solution dye removal efficiency is not depends on the initial ph of the solution in aqueous solution mb easily react with clo4 by complexation appears with light green color results in the efficacy of mb adsorption are enhanced in go chit mno2nrs 38 3 5 recyclability of go chit mno2nrs in order to make the synthesised go chit mno2nrs hybrid materials to be suitable for practical and industrial applications we carried out the recyclability test after every dye removal adsorption kinetic experiment the adsorbent was recovered by centrifugation at 6000 rpm followed by washing with distilled water and ethanol the recyclability experiment was conducted by measuring the uv absorbance of every cycle after the complete removal of dyes the experiment confirmed that the developed material was found to be an active even after 10 successive cycles nevertheless after the fifth cycle the effectiveness of the material reduced minimally which is attributed due to the minor leaching of mno2nrs similarly recycle experiment performed in ab dye revealed that the go chit mno2nrs nanohybrid can be effectively employed as an adsorbent material at least for 10 times without noteworthy loss in its dye removal activity fig s12 3 6 characteristics discussion of adsorption of go chit mno2nrs towards ab and mb ionic dyes the upcoming characteristic discussions express that the successful formation of go chit and their supported mno2nrs the versatile nature of the go chit mno2nrs hybrid will bring about physical and chemical transformations on interaction with the potential substrate henceforth we examined the efficiency of the synthesised go chit mno2nrs hybrid towards the adsorption of various ionic dyes to investigate the physical adsorption properties of the adsorbed mb and ab organic dyes over go chit mno2nrs ft ir investigation was performed after the adsorption process go chit mno2nrs hybrid material was removed carefully using an easy filtration technique and followed by five times constant washing with distilled water and then dried under vacuum at 50 c we noticed in the ft ir spectra after the ab dye adsorption process the new n n azo bond and sulfonate group so3 stretching vibrational peaks appeared at 1604 cm 1 and 1030 cm 1 respectively fig 12b similarly the typical no2 functional group vibration bands of the ab dye appeared at 1662 and 1510 cm 1 interestingly strong physical adsorption through the valuable red shift in the nh2 vibration after ab adsorption 3423 cm 1 is shifted to 3351 cm 1 was observed 25 the successful removal of mb adsorption was confirmed using ft ir investigation fig 12c mb adsorbed go chit mno2nrs material exhibited four strong stretching vibrational ft ir peak for 3 amine at 1231 for n n at 1220 for s at 1226 and for quaternary 4 amine at 2924 cm 1 respectively ft ir results of newly appearing characteristic peak of adsorbed mb and ab dye and their notable nh2 peak shift in the stretching vibration denotes that all the dyes are completely adsorbed on the go chit mno2nrs hybrid system 4 conclusions industrial toxic dyes are polluting aquatic environments and have serious health effects in this work we successfully synthesised and designed mno2 nanorods nrs decorated on chitosan grafted graphene oxide mno2nrs go chit hybrid material which is an effective adsorbent in removal of cationic methylene blue mb and anionic amido black 10 ab10 dyes from xrd it is confirmed the formation of single layer go and the semi crystalline go chit mno2 nrs composite structure from the characterisation results it is evident that the oxygen containing functional groups were exist over the go chit surface which lead to π π interactions and reactive defect sites for mno2 nrs moreover after the incorporation of mno2 surface basicity improved significantly and lead to high adsorption capacity towards ionic dyes both dyes are completely removed from the solution however the removal of cationic dye mb took 24 min i e 29 times much faster absorbance time than anionic ab10 dye 700 min for the complete adsorption the synergistic effects of mno2 and go chit exhibited stronger electrostatic attractions towards cationic mb than anionic dyes at c0 100 mg l 1 higher than 95 dye removal efficiency with maximum capacity of qmax 329 mg g 1 was achieved at higher ph value i e in basic nature a maximum adsorption capacity can be achieved from the adsorption kinetic and isotherm models mb adsorption over mno2nrs go chit hybrid material follows pseudo second order pso kinetic model and homogenous monolayer langmuir adsorption finally mno2nrs go chit hybrid material found to be highly stable after 10 successive adsorption cycles and promising candidate to develop further for full commercialisation declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgements we acknowledge
