16685,this work intends to promote the growth of microalgae biomass with simultaneous remediation of an agro industrial wastewater winery wastewater ww was used as growth media for the cyanobacteria arthrospira maxima and the green microalgae scenedesmus obliquus auxenochlorella protothecoides and chlorella vulgaris under mixotrophic and heterotrophic conditions the latter species stands out under mixotrophic conditions with removals of toc and tn above 90 biomass production and pollutant removal were influenced by the initial ww concentration maximum removal values within 8 days of incubation were 92 91 49 and 40 for cod tn polyphenols and p po4 respectively and 147 5 mg l 1 d 1 of biomass productivity c vulgaris biomass showed higher carotenoid content maximum of 8 7 mg g when grown in ww compared to autotrophic conditions 6 5 mg g making the bioremediation process more viable with the production of valuable by products such as pigments as the pollutant load removed by the microalgae does not allow reach the legal limits of release treated waters in natural water courses a tertiary treatment process was applied a post treatment by photocatalysis in a uv leds photoreactor with tio2 supported in raschig rings was proposed for the removal of cod and polyphenols from a high loaded ww the heterogeneous photocatalytic process was efficient in removing 80 of total polyphenols and 40 of cod allowing the release of the treated water in superficial water courses since complies with the legal limits cod below 150 mg l 1 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords winery wastewater microalgae biomass nutrient removal heterogeneous photocatalysis titanium dioxide 1 introduction wine making generate large volumes of organic and inorganic wastes the liquid effluents are usually referred as winery wastewater ww and are mainly originated in washing operations during grape harvesting pressing and rinsing of fermentation tanks and other equipment these wastewaters are a major waste stream which volume and pollution load vary due to the seasonality of wine production it is estimated that a winery generates 0 5 to 14 l of wastewater per l of wine produced amor et al 2019 bustamante et al 2005 the composition of ww consists mainly of organic compounds sugars ethanol esters glycerol organic acids phenolic compounds and the ph is generally acidic 4 and 5 brito et al 2007 the chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp concentrations of ww have been reported to range from 320 49 105 10 415 and 2 1 280 mg l respectively ioannou et al 2015 therefore attending to the volume and composition of these wastewaters the environmental impact from its direct discharge into water courses is of great concern nowadays several ww treatment technologies are available and involve in most cases the use of biological processes due to the high content on organic biodegradable compounds amor et al 2019 employing microalgae in the treatment of wastewater has proven to be effective and an economic method of wastewater treatment due to their adaptability of growing in various wastewater streams low energy requirements efficient recycling of nutrients removal of heavy metals and reduction of waste sludge formation ferreira et al 2018 gouveia et al 2016 serrà et al 2020 although being photoautotrophic microorganisms microalgae can be cultivated under other growth regimes in heterotrophic path light is absent and growth only require organic carbon compounds and mixotrophism that combines autotrophic photosynthesis and heterotrophic metabolisms mata et al 2010 a solution to increase biomass concentration independently from the incident light intensity manhaeghe et al 2020 however to make this cultivation technique feasible a cheap organic carbon source must be used and therefore the easily available agro industrial wastewaters are an excellent alternative there is evidence that several organic compounds present in those wastewaters can support mixotrophic growth such as sugars glucose lactose and sucrose and organic acids such as acetate bhatnagar et al 2011 higgins et al 2018 ribeiro et al 2017 besides providing higher productivities of biomass mixotrophic cultivation in wastewater can enhance lipid starch and proteins synthesis when compared to photoautotrophic nutrition abreu et al 2012 additionally wastewaters can be used as cheap nutrient sources for algal biomass production which simultaneously remove nitrogen and phosphorus compounds helping to reduce eutrophication in the aquatic environments mendonça et al 2021 pointed out that wastewaters resources can be integrated in the concept of circular economy and bioeconomy to improve microalgae biomass production as feedstock for bio based products biomaterials and biofuels the application of microalgae in ww treatment is already reported in literature but has not been deeply studied the ability of using these wastewaters as a carbon and other nutrient sources is described mainly with the use of the genera chlorella and only under mixotrophic conditions casazza et al 2016 ganeshkumar et al 2018 higgins et al 2018 liu et al 2016 spennati et al 2020 tsolcha et al 2017 due to seasonal variability of effluents of the winery industry compounds recalcitrant to biodegradation may predominate which can compromise the efficiency of biological treatments and requires different approaches or the combination of different processes including advanced oxidation processes aop as a pre or post treatment step amaral silva et al 2016 braz et al 2010 solís et al 2017 among aop heterogeneous photocatalysis with titanium dioxide tio2 has a wide application in agro industrial wastewater treatment in the total degradation of organic contaminants into h2o and co2 amor et al 2019 tio2 is inexpensive chemically stable and its photogenerated holes and electrons are highly oxidizing and reducing respectively being only activated by uv radiation bertagna silva et al 2021 stasinakis 2008 regarding uv light sources light emitting diodes leds are emerging as an alternative to conventional mercury vapour uv lamps opening new possibilities for wastewater treatment matafonova and batoev 2018 several studies have investigated the use of tio2 uv for ww treatment photocatalysis with tio2 have been applied to remove organic carbon from synthetic and real ww samples in photoreactors equipped with uv mercury lamps agustina et al 2008 gimeno et al 2007 and under solar radiation lucas et al 2009 navarro et al 2005 however process efficiency was found to improve with h2o2 or and sulphate radical promoters gimeno et al 2007 navarro et al 2005 and complete mineralization can occur with ozone generation lucas et al 2009 tio2 based systems were also applied after biologically treated ww with efficient organic carbon removal in a cpc reactor souza et al 2013 and in a uv a photoreactor solís et al 2017 with the almost complete degradation of polyphenols however all these studies employed tio2 in suspended form in conventional photocatalytic processes tio2 powder is dispersed in the wastewater which leads to a difficult catalyst separation at the end of the treatment process immobilization of tio2 on solid supports e g glass can overcome that problem and become a more sustainable solution immobilized tio2 has been recently applied for the degradation of phenols pharmaceutics and dyes bertagna silva et al 2021 srikanth et al 2017 as far as the authors know in the literature there are no studies that directly combine microalgae and aops for the treatment of ww the main purposes of this work are 1 investigate the possibility of using four microalgae species c vulgaris a protothecoides s obliquus green microalgae and a maxima cyanobacteria in the treatment of ww when cultivated under mixotrophic and heterotrophic conditions 2 evaluation of the effect of ww on microalgae growth and pigment content chlorophylls and carotenoids compared to autotrophic microalgal cultivation and 3 assess the efficiency of a uv a led lab scale photosystem combined with immobilized tio2 as a post treatment to reach the legal limits of wastewater release in natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater the wastewaters used in this study were collected from a

utex 25 cp and arthrospira spirulina maxima setchell gardner lb 2342 am the selected microalgae were chosen due to its versatility and effectiveness in removing contaminants from agro industrial wastewaters of different origins as well as their potential for energy and added value products generation abreu et al 2012 darpito et al 2015 hodaifa et al 2020 molinuevo salces et al 2016 olguín et al 2003 ribeiro et al 2017 all cultures were obtained from the national laboratory of energy and geology lneg in lumiar lisbon portugal c vulgaris and a protothecoides were maintained in an inorganic

100 mg mgso4 7h2o and 1 ml trace elements solution vonshak 1986 2 3 photoreactor and uv led system the heterogenous photocatalysis experiments were carried out in a lab scale batch reactor which was illuminated with a uv a led photosystem ferreira et al 2020 the reactor had a volume capacity of 110 ml and the uv a led matrix consisted in 12 indium gallium nitride with a nominal consumption of 3 w when the applied current was 700 ma and a peak wavelength λ 365 nm the experiments were carried out with a current intensity of 630 ma corresponding to an uv irradiance of 85 w m2 the led system was fixed above the reactor and equipped with a fan for heat dissipation purposes 2 4 preparation of tio2 photocatalysts tio2 degussa p 25 evonik was used as photocatalyst and was immobilized on cylindrical glass raschig rings d l 0 5 cm by heat attachment method based on the optimized process elsewhere behnajady et al 2008 first the glass surface was treated by hf 1 m overnight and naoh 1 m for 30 min at 90 c to make irregular surface for better contact of tio2 on surface and increase the number of oh groups for higher adhesion to the glass a suspension of 10 g l tio2 p25 was prepared with ethanol and its ph was adjusted to about 3 by hcl 1 m the suspension was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath bandelin sonorex super pk 106 for 15 min to improve the tio2 dispersion and then was poured on the glass rings and allowed to dry in an oven memmert u30 at 90 c after drying the glass rings were calcinated at 500 c for 3 h in a muffle naber industrieofenbau and finally washed with distilled water to remove weakly immobilized particles this process was repeated three times to optimize the load of tio2 p25 on the surface of the glass no more than three coatings were performed taking into account that some catalyst disaggregation can occur when using more than 3 layers of tio2 in raschig rings sampaio et al 2013 the glass rings fig 1 a were weighed before and at the end of the immobilization process to quantify the mass of catalyst immobilized on the glass surface scanning electron microscopy sem pictures of the immobilized photocatalyst were recorded using an environmental scanning electron microscope fei quanta 400 w esem fig 1b show the glass surface with rough morphology with the presence of tio2 particles attached 2 5 experimental setup 2 5 1 microalgae cultivation in winery wastewater different cultivation conditions were carried out table 1 experiments were performed using wws as substrate under mixotrophic and heterotrophic conditions mc and hc respectively four wastewaters ww 1 4 were used with increasing nutrient concentrations table 2 by mixing samples of the collected wastewater and diluting with distilled water cultivation in microalgal inorganic media under autotrophic conditions ac was used as a control for microalgal growth first to investigate if the low ph of the effluent 4 is an inhibitory factor for microalgal growth all microalgae species were cultivated in 100 ml flasks using ww 1 then to evaluate microalgae growth and removal of toc and tn mixotrophic mc and heterotrophic hc studies were performed in 1 l flask using cultivated in ww 1 finally it was assessed the effect of the concentration of wastewater ww 1 to ww 4 on c vulgaris biomass accumulation as well as on cod tn tp and polyphenols removal under mixotrophic conditions mc the volume of inoculum added to the ww was calculated in order to obtain an optical density od around 0 15 0 20 at 540 nm rocha et al 2003 which corresponds to a biomass concentration of approximately 100 mg l 1 od measurements were performed against ww to avoid interference of ww compounds the autotrophic and mixotrophic cultures were kept under continuous illumination light intensity of 20 25 µmol photons m 2 s 1 supplied by a white 7 w led lamp while the heterotrophic were kept in the dark the cultivations were performed in two replicates and ww without microalgae inoculum were used as control all experiments were conducted in erlenmeyer flasks incubated in an orbital shaker new brunswick scientific at 23 2 c under an agitation speed of 100 rpm the assays were conducted until the stationary phase was reached to prevent contamination by environmental microorganisms all the laboratorial material and glassware were autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min inoculations and samplings were performed in aseptic conditions in a biosafety cabinet microflow advanced biosafety cabinet class ii 2 5 2 tio2 uv leds photocatalysis after ww microalgal bioremediation the treated wastewater was filtered 1 6 μm and a post treatment with tio2 based photocatalysis in the led photoreactor was carried out different samples of bioremediated ww were used to assess the effect of the initial cod concentration on the efficiency of the combination of tio2 led system it was evaluated the aop efficiency in terms of toc and polyphenols removal still present in the wastewater after the microalgal bioremediation tio2 supported glass rings were added to the photoreactor until fully cover its bottom surface it was added a mixing unit to the photoreactor and experiments were performed under well mixing conditions in batch mode experiments were carried out at natural ph of the solution and the temperature was in the range of 18 21 c at predetermined times samples were withdrawn from the reactor to monitor the concentration of organic carbon at the end of the treatments the glass rings were washed with distilled water dried overnight at 80 c and weighted to calculate the loss of immobilized tio2 during the process recycle tests of the immobilized tio2 rings was assessed with the same reactor uv led system under the conditions described above 2 6 growth and bioremediation performance monitoring microalgae growth in ww was monitored daily by measuring the od at 540 nm of culture samples and by calculating the biomass ash free dry weight afdw afdw was determined by filtering the samples with a glass microfiber of 1 6 μm pore size drying overnight at 105 c and incinerating in a muffle for 1 h at 550 c the culture ph was measured using a laboratory ph meter crison micro ph 2000 uv vis measurements were carried out in a uv vis jasco v 530 spectrophotometer after filtration of the culture samples the filtrate was collected and characterized in terms of ph toc tn cod tp and polyphenols as described in section 2 1 to evaluate the efficiency of the treatment the ph toc and tn were measured daily and the other parameters were determined only at the start and end of the experiments 2 7 determination of specific growth rate and biomass productivity the maximum specific growth rate µ day 1 was calculated in the linear region of the growth curve according to the equation µ ln x 2 x 1 t 1 where x 1 and x 2 are the afdw at the beginning t 1 and at the end t 2 of the exponential phase biomass productivity px mg l 1 day 1 was calculated by the expression px x 0 t t 0 at time t and t 0 at the beginning of the experiment 2 8 quantification of chlorophylls and carotenoids 1 1 please correct the equations in section 2 7 at the end of the experiments with c vulgaris the biomass produced was quantified in terms of cellular pigments chlorophylls a and b and carotenoids 2 ml of the culture were first concentrated by centrifugation for 10 min at 3500 rpm hettich eba 8s and the pigments were extracted with 90 acetone as described elsewhere marchão et al 2018 the amount of chlorophylls a and b and carotenoids in the total liquid phase collected was spectrophotometrically quantified according to the equations described elsewhere strickland and parsons 1972 and the final pigments concentrations were expressed as milligrams on ash free dry weigh basis 2 9 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using one way analysis of variance anova and differences were considered as significant when p 0 05 average values were compared using tukey s test the statistical analyses were performed using originpro 8 all data are presented as mean and standard error mean se 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the wastewaters table 2 shows that tn and p po4 3 concentrations in the ww were low maximum values of 3 90 and 2 60 mg l 1 respectively and already lower than legal discharge limits 15 and 10 mg l 1 respectively decree law n 236 98 portugal on the other hand cod concentrations stands out and are higher than regulatory discharge limit 150 mg o2 l 1 c n ratios are high within from 159 to 197 whereas n p ratios are very low and within the range from 1 5 to 2 6 these ratios are comparable to those obtained for a winery wastewater derived from the washing after grape processing tsolcha et al 2017 it seems that the wws in this work were n deficient since it is reported that an optimal c n p mass ratio of 46 1 7 7 1 can be deduced for microalgae hillebrand and sommer 1999 and it is suggested that n p ratios higher than 5 and 6 in wastewaters lead to higher biomass productivities chen et al 2012 choi and lee 2015 3 2 influence of winery wastewater ph on microalgal growth since the wws used in this work was acidic ph 4 4 5 it was firstly evaluated if microalgal growth was inhibited on one hand auxenochlorella chlorella and scenedesmus microalgae have optimum growth at circumneutral and alkaline values laying generally between 6 and 9 and on the other hand arthrospira is alkaliphilic and presents the best growth at ph 9 it was observed that after adding microalgae inoculum 5 10 v v to ww 1 ph 4 4 and low orthophosphate concentration table 2 and a low buffer capacity the ph increased to values within optimum range in all microalgae media this is because the inoculum consisted in microalgae suspended in inorganic media which are rich in orthophosphates namely k2hpo4 and kh2po4 with high buffer capacity since the initial ph of all cultures was already within the optimal range fig 2 ww without any ph correction was used in the subsequent studies furthermore an increase of the ph was observed over the incubation period fig 2 most probably due the microalgae assimilation of fatty acids organic and phenolic acids compounds that may contribute with a significantly fraction of cod welz et al 2016 in these effluents 3 3 microalgae screening the growth of the microalgae cultivated under three growth conditions ac hc and mc were determined by calculating the afdw the initial biomass concentration for all microalgae and conditions was calculated to be approximately the same 100 mg afdw l 1 considering the relatively harsh conditions when cultivated in ww an acidic unsterilized and nitrogen limited medium the microalgae showed a good performance under heterotrophic conditions there was a rapid growth after only one day fig 3 with maximal growth rates of 0 60 d 1 for c vulgaris and 0 61 d 1 for a protothecoides achieving higher productivities p 0 05 than both mixotrophic and autotrophic conditions table 3 but despite the initial higher growth rates the overall hc biomass yield was lower than those obtained for the ac and mc conditions the growth stabilized after 1 4 days depending on the species of incubation and started to decline death phase one explanation could be the fact that the unsterile wastewater contains other heterotrophic microorganisms such as bacteria fungi and protozoa which in the dark could out compete the microalgae for nutrients and or have a predatory interaction muñoz and guieysse 2006 additionally the heterotrophic metabolism may require micronutrients or vitamins that may be absent from ww an effluent nutritionally exhausted by the heterotrophs involved in wine making such as yeasts and lactic acid bacteria balmaseda et al 2018 the equilibrium between photoautotrophic and heterotrophic growth is instable for c vulgaris grown in axenic conditions it was suggest that photoautotrophic growth is the preferential growth mechanism under mixotrophic conditions light plus inorganic and organic carbon sources but at high oxygen concentrations the heterotrophic growth pathway is activated manhaeghe et al 2020 under mixotrophic conditions c vulgaris a protothecoides and s obliquus continued to grow well for 8 to 10 days when the stationary phase was reached fig 3 however for a maxima lysis is shown to start after 4 days represented by the decline in the growth curve the exponential phase is generally reached in the first day of incubation but c vulgaris and a protothecoides seem to have a second phase from the third to the fourth day showing a rapid growth maximum growth rate of 0 61 d 1 for c vulgaris in that time span higher maximal biomass concentration and productivities were attained table 3 when compared to phototrophic conditions for the same period of incubation c vulgaris presented the highest biomass concentration p 0 05 other authors also reported that mixotrophic cultivation leads to higher productivities than autotrophic cultivation when microalgae are grown in wastewaters from poultry raisin and winery piggery and dairy industries bhatnagar et al 2011 ribeiro et al 2017 tsolcha et al 2017 it was evaluated the removal of toc and tn along the incubation period of microalgae under heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions fig 4 and maximal removal rates are summarized in table 3 it can be highlighted although is not surprising that nutrient removal rate is proportional to the microalgal biomass production initial toc and cod were approximately 203 and 595 mg l 1 respectively regarding initial tn values were higher than those obtained in the wastewater characterization table 2 this occurs because the microalgae inoculum was suspended in inorganic medium with higher nitrogen content nitrate salts particularly chlorella and spirulina media than ww consequently the inoculum had a significant influence in increasing the initial value of 1 27 to 7 10 mg n l 1 for c vulgaris and a protothecoides and almost 20 mg n l 1 for a maxima the same observation was made for initial tp the fact that microalgae growth benefited from the n and p inputs of the culture medium means that these nutrients are limiting the microalgae growth which can be a drawback in the use of this effluent alone for production of algal biomass microalgae uses photosynthesis as anabolic path produces energy for biosynthesis and growth and respiration and fermentation as catabolic paths uses energy to break down for growth these metabolic processes work together microalgae were able to grow under heterotrophic conditions consuming the organic carbon in the wastewater by respiration and fermentation metabolisms the fixed carbon during photosynthesis stored starch green microalgae or glycogen a maxima are later broken down providing glucose for energy source depending on the species and the growth conditions after glucose has been converted to pyruvate it can be further metabolized by respiration or fermentation both metabolisms described in microalgae mainly in chlorella species hu et al 2018 all species consumed toc rapidly in the initial two days when cultivated under heterotrophic conditions and the removals were similar p 0 05 ranging from 75 to 88 in mixotrophic cultivation the removal was slower fig 4b but the percentages obtained were similar to those in heterotrophic condition except for s obliquus nitrogen was consumed rapidly within the first 2 and 3 days for both growth conditions maximal values were obtained for s obliquus under heterotrophic conditions 97 and c vulgaris under mixotrophic conditions 92 nitrogen is a macronutrient necessary for the synthesis of nucleic acids proteins and energy carrying molecules atp accounting for 1 20 of dry cell mass shahid et al 2020 the nitrogen sources enter the cell by active transport with nitrites no2 n and nitrates no3 n being reduced to ammonium nh4 n after entering the cell which in turn is incorporated into amino acids through the glutamate cycle liu et al 2015 in these wws no3 n was the predominant n source due to input of the inorganic media also part of nitrogen could be removed by nh4 n volatilization gonçalves et al 2017 after the first sharp decrease it is verified an increase of tn tn0 for a maxima under both hc and mc for c vulgaris a protothecoides under hc values for the latter were higher than 1 and are not represented in fig 4c this could be due to cellular death previously mentioned fig 3 similar observation was also made by other authors liu et al 2016 who concluded that dead cells could be responsible for the high tn concentration at the end of some experimental sets the removal in the non inoculated controls unsterilized were 13 for toc and 50 for tn mainly due to fungi proliferation at the end of the microalgal screening experiments it is possible to highlight that mixotrophic conditions are preferable considering the removal and growth parameters c vulgaris and a protothecoides showed significantly higher results for toc and tn removals taking also into account the maximal biomass concentration c vulgaris obtained the highest value p 0 05 and was chosen for further biodegradation studies 3 4 influence of wastewater concentration on growth and bioremediation performance of c vulgaris the concentration of ww was adjusted to have wastewaters with different initial concentrations table 4 to grow c vulgaris by diluting the collected wastewaters with distilled water the initial tn and tp concentration were similar amongst the four wastewaters about 20 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 for n and p respectively after the addition of the same amount of microalgal inoculum containing medium that presented higher nutrient concentrations than ww this agrees with the results of initial tn obtained in another work with ww liu et al 2016 removal of toc fig 5 a was maximum after 6 days for the lower initial concentrations 595 and 1238 mg o2 l 1 ww 1 and 2 and was slower for higher concentrations 1777 and 2441 mg o2 l 1 ww 3 and 4 reaching maximal values after 8 days tn was rapidly consumed within 3 days for all wastewaters fig 5b c vulgaris presented higher growth rates and biomass productivities fig 6 a for increasing concentrations of the effluent pollutant load which is an expected result as more carbon sources are available to consume and accumulate biomass also it may indicate that c vulgaris is resilient to ww toxicity fig 6b shows the influence of initial ww concentration on removal percentages c vulgaris was efficient in removing cod and nitrogen for wws 1 3 cod removal was approximately 90 and for ww 4 was lower p 0 05 but still high 80 tn removal were similar amongst the wws p 0 382 an in the range of 80 to 90 similar results were obtained by other authors when using ww for instance it was achieved a cod reduction of more than 92 by the co culture chlorella vulgaris and arthrospira platensis spennati et al 2020 diplosphaera sp was used for bioremediation of diluted ww liu et al 2016 and it was attained 90 and 70 removal for cod and tn respectively moreover using a leptolyngbya based microbial consortium maximum removal of 86 for cod and 84 for tn were observed tsolcha et al 2017 phosphorus is another important macronutrient second only to nitrogen and participates in the nucleic acids cellular membrane structure phosphorylation reactions atp regeneration in addition to the cell division reactions shahid et al 2020 microalgae can assimilate this nutrient in the orthophosphate forms h2po4 and hpo4 2 through phosphorylation gonçalves et al 2017 however mendonça et al 2021 concluded that phosphorus removal from wastewaters in algal systems may be often difficult with most results less than 35 removal by analysing initial and final concentrations table 4 the mass of p removed by c vulgaris is similar p 0 05 for all the tested wws removal percentages are in the range of 36 to 47 being maximal for ww 4 fig 6b a similar percentage 36 was obtained with the cultivation of chlorella sp in a winery wastewater ganeshkumar et al 2018 tp removal could have been not only due to metabolic uptake of orthophosphate but also due to ph mediated processes as for ph values above 8 phosphorus precipitation can occur gonçalves et al 2017 under light the removal of p by c vulgaris depends on the initial n concentration in wastewater beuckels et al 2015 in this work all the four ww had similar initial n concentration around 20 mg l 1 but the percentage of p removal was higher although not significantly in ww 4 that had a higher initial n phenolic compounds are considered toxic to many microorganisms but can also be considered as carbon and energy sources the metabolism involved is not yet completely understood but is suggested that microalgae can remove phenolic compounds by mineralization to carbon dioxide or biochemical modification to other compounds lindner and pleissner 2019 there is some evidence that microalgae can remove efficiently phenols from ww in the work by spennati et al 2020 with the co culture of c vulgaris and a platensis polyphenols were reduced by more than 50 although the polyphenolic content in wws in this work was low considering the normal values mean of 205 mg l for these effluents ioannou et al 2015 c vulgaris achieved no more than 40 removal maximum value registered for ww 3 polyphenols removal in ww 1 was not evaluated as the initial concentration was already below the legal limit for wastewater discharge however it is important to note that the removal for the selected parameters could have also been accomplished by other microorganisms since the cultures were not sterilized in reality treatment systems include a complex mixture of bacteria along with algae among other interactions aerobic bacteria degrade organic pollutants by respiration using the o2 produced by microalgae and in turn release the co2 necessary for microalgal photosynthesis muñoz and guieysse 2006 final cod concentrations for ww 3 and ww 4 despite the high removals and polyphenols for ww 2 ww 3 and ww 4 were still above the legal limits for wastewater discharge decree law 236 98 portugal of 150 mg o2 l 1 and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively consequently there is the need for a post treatment step to improve the quality of the final discharge 3 5 pigment accumulation during c vulgaris mixotrophic bioremediation of wastewaters due to high quality requirements biomass produced from wastewater is not suitable to produce high value chemicals for food medical or cosmetic application but it can be used for animal feed in particular cultivation of chlorella has been used for the production of pigments as natural colouring ingredients for feed formulation in aquaculture and poultry guedes et al 2011 and there are some examples in the literature that use wastewater for that purpose olguín 2012 ribeiro et al 2017 the final content of chlorophylls a and b and carotenoids in c vulgaris cultivated ww was determined fig 7 chlorophyll contents of c vulgaris grown in ww are lower than the value obtained in the autotrophic condition 27 80 mg g 1 the reduction in chlorophyll production by mixotrophic chlorella compared to autotrophic cultures was also observed by other authors using ww ganeshkumar et al 2018 and other carbon sources such as glucose and dairy wastewater cheirsilp and torpee 2012 ribeiro et al 2017 moreover there was a decrease of chlorophylls with the increase of initial organic carbon concentration in ww with significant changes for ww 2 4 a maximum of 20 90 mg g 1 was obtained in ww 1 it was observed a green colour loss in the cultures that were grown in higher concentrations of ww because of the lower chlorophyll production it was found that organic substrates have a negative effect on the formation of the photosynthetic apparatus leading to a significant reduction in terms of photosynthetic capacity of microalgal cells yang et al 2000 even inhibiting photosynthesis at high toc concentrations chandra et al 2014 it is worth noting that polyphenols organic compounds frequently associated to cell oxidative stress are under the detection limit in ww1 but steadily increase in ww2 ww4 2 and 4 fold c vulgaris is sensitive to high concentrations of phenolic compounds in particular when the cultures were grown under phototrophic or heterotrophic conditions the toxicity was reversed or alleviated upon mixotrophic growth of the cultures megharaj et al 1992 conditions selected in this work regarding carotenoids content it was found that the values increased when growing c vulgaris in ww although not significantly p 0 05 compared to autotrophism 6 54 mg g 1 except for ww 4 biomass cultivated in ww 1 shows the higher content 8 65 mg g 1 it is known that microalgae under environmental stress may increase their carotenoids content as a response of cell oxidative response guedes et al 2011 also the carotenoid profile may be altered as astaxanthin that is synthesized by microalgae under nitrogen starvation ip et al 2004 condition verified in the wastewaters used in this work in future studies in addition to pigments other components of the biomass should be analysed as other metabolic pathways besides carotenogenesis can be shifted under nitrogen starvation such as enhanced lipid synthesis and triglyceride accumulation shahid et al 2020 many microalgae including c vulgaris produce transesterificable lipids in mixotrophic conditions that can be used as biodiesel arora and philippidis 2021 tsolcha et al 2017 3 6 tio2 uv led photocatalysis 3 6 1 post treatment of ww after microalgae bioremediation and biomass removal treated wastewater was collected and sampled to obtain different initial concentrations sets a b and c table 5 before applying photocatalysis the catalyst load was constant by using the same amount of tio2 coated rings n inside of the reactor almost no degradation was verified when tio2 is absent 2 using uncoated rings only uv a leds photolysis photocatalytic efficiency was evaluated in terms of toc removal over time fig 8 initial degradation of toc follows a pseudo first order kinetics described by 1 d toc d t k toc where toc is toc concentration k is the kinetic constant and t is the reaction time the integration of eq 1 gives 2 ln toc toc 0 k t where toc 0 corresponds to toc concentration at t 0 a linear fitting of eq 2 to the data obtained gave the kinetic constants fig 8 removal of toc was slower with the increase of the initial organic carbon concentration however final cod values were below 150 mg o2 l 1 which complies with the legislation phenols degradation were high 100 for experimental set b and 80 for c but final concentration for set c was still above the legal value table 5 the principal reactions leading to pollutant decomposition involves hydroxyl radicals oh which are extremely powerful and non selective oxidants capable of oxidizing most organics compounds in particular phenols degradation occurs when oh attacks the phenol ring yielding catechol resorcinol hydroquinone and benzoquinone an then the rings in these compounds break up to give organic acids and finally co2 guo et al 2006 sampaio et al 2013 according to pawar and lee 2015 the generation of radicals in photocatalysis with titanium dioxide are as follows 3 ti o 2 h v h e 4 h h 2 o o h h 5 h o h o h 6 e o 2 o 2 7 o 2 h h o 2 a more efficient photocatalytic process could be achieved by using an oxidant agent such as hydrogen peroxide however this would increase the cost of the process at the end of each experiment the amount of tio2 that was lost in the process and photocatalyst washing was not significant 1 to 3 meaning that the adhesion technique of tio2 to the glass support was successful 3 6 2 recycle test to assess the durability of tio2 coating reutilization tests were performed using the same tio2 coated rings applied to a sample set a of microalgae treated winery wastewater see section 3 6 1 results fig 9 show that the photocatalytic activity of immobilized tio2 did not decrease considerable after 5 cycles 4 conclusions winery wastewater can be successfully used for the growth of microalgae mixotrophic cultivation of c vulgaris showed the best potential for its application in both bioremediation of these wastewaters and biomass productivity able to remove above 80 of cod and tn content and produce 49 5 mg afdw l 1 d 1 our data suggest that growing c vulgaris in ww could be a cost effective approach not only for removal of pollutants but also for producing valuable biomass e g carotenoids to be applied in feed formulation nevertheless future research is required to improve the bioremediation process as the biomass yield as wws are nitrogen deprived the accumulation of lipids could be enhanced so the final biomass quality should be researched in future work towards biofuel biodiesel production for wastewaters with a higher organic load applying uv leds photocatalysis as post treatment could help to clean up ww that will be discharged into the environment and improve global efficiency the system used was efficient in degrading polyphenols above 80 of degradation for which c vulgaris showed the lower removal percentages among ww pollutants using tio2 immoblized raschig rings economic viability of the process could be improved due to the ease at separating the catalyst at the end of experiments and its reutilization with insignificant mass losses immobilized tio2 can be reused for four times without any considerable loss of its photocatalytic activity declaration of

arthrospira maxima and the green microalgae scenedesmus obliquus auxenochlorella protothecoides and chlorella vulgaris under mixotrophic and heterotrophic conditions the latter species stands out under mixotrophic conditions with removals of toc and tn above 90 biomass production and pollutant removal were influenced by the initial ww concentration maximum removal values within 8 days of incubation were 92 91 49 and 40 for cod tn polyphenols and p po4 respectively and 147 5 mg l 1 d 1 of biomass productivity c vulgaris biomass showed higher carotenoid content maximum of 8 7 mg g when grown in ww compared to autotrophic conditions 6 5 mg g making the bioremediation process more viable with the production of valuable by products such as pigments as the pollutant load removed by the microalgae does not allow reach the legal limits of release treated waters in natural water courses a tertiary treatment process was applied a post treatment by photocatalysis in a uv leds photoreactor with tio2 supported in raschig rings was proposed for the removal of cod and polyphenols from a high loaded ww the heterogeneous photocatalytic process was efficient in removing 80 of total polyphenols and 40 of cod allowing the release of the treated water in superficial water courses since complies with the legal limits cod below 150 mg l 1 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords winery wastewater microalgae biomass nutrient removal heterogeneous photocatalysis titanium dioxide 1 introduction wine making generate large volumes of organic and inorganic wastes the liquid effluents are usually referred as winery wastewater ww and are mainly originated in washing operations during grape harvesting pressing and rinsing of fermentation tanks and other equipment these wastewaters are a major waste stream which volume and pollution load vary due to the seasonality of wine production it is estimated that a winery generates 0 5 to 14 l of wastewater per l of wine produced amor et al 2019 bustamante et al 2005 the composition of ww consists mainly of organic compounds sugars ethanol esters glycerol organic acids phenolic compounds and the ph is generally acidic 4 and 5 brito et al 2007 the chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp concentrations of ww have been reported to range from 320 49 105 10 415 and 2 1 280 mg l respectively ioannou et al 2015 therefore attending to the volume and composition of these wastewaters the environmental impact from its direct discharge into water courses is of great concern nowadays several ww treatment technologies are available and involve in most cases the use of biological processes due to the high content on organic biodegradable compounds amor et al 2019 employing microalgae in the treatment of wastewater has proven to be effective and an economic method of wastewater treatment due to their adaptability of growing in various wastewater streams low energy requirements efficient recycling of nutrients removal of heavy metals and reduction of waste sludge formation ferreira et al 2018 gouveia et al 2016 serrà et al 2020 although being photoautotrophic microorganisms microalgae can be cultivated under other growth regimes in heterotrophic path light is absent and growth only require organic carbon compounds and mixotrophism that combines autotrophic photosynthesis and heterotrophic metabolisms mata et al 2010 a solution to increase biomass concentration independently from the incident light intensity manhaeghe et al 2020 however to make this cultivation technique feasible a cheap organic carbon source must be used and therefore the easily available agro industrial wastewaters are an excellent alternative there is evidence that several organic compounds present in those wastewaters can support mixotrophic growth such as sugars glucose lactose and sucrose and organic acids such as acetate bhatnagar et al 2011 higgins et al 2018 ribeiro et al 2017 besides providing higher productivities of biomass mixotrophic cultivation in wastewater can enhance lipid starch and proteins synthesis when compared to photoautotrophic nutrition abreu et al 2012 additionally wastewaters can be used as cheap nutrient sources for algal biomass production which simultaneously remove nitrogen and phosphorus compounds helping to reduce eutrophication in the aquatic environments mendonça et al 2021 pointed out that wastewaters resources can be integrated in the concept of circular economy and bioeconomy to improve microalgae biomass production as feedstock for bio based products biomaterials and biofuels the application of microalgae in ww treatment is already reported in literature but has not been deeply studied the ability of using these wastewaters as a carbon and other nutrient sources is described mainly with the use of the genera chlorella and only under mixotrophic conditions casazza et al 2016 ganeshkumar et al 2018 higgins et al 2018 liu et al 2016 spennati et al 2020 tsolcha et al 2017 due to seasonal variability of effluents of the winery industry compounds recalcitrant to biodegradation may predominate which can compromise the efficiency of biological treatments and requires different approaches or the combination of different processes including advanced oxidation processes aop as a pre or post treatment

et al 2017 with the almost complete degradation of polyphenols however all these studies employed tio2 in suspended form in conventional photocatalytic processes tio2 powder is dispersed in the wastewater which leads to a difficult catalyst separation at the end of the treatment process immobilization of tio2 on solid supports e g glass can overcome that problem and become a more sustainable solution immobilized tio2 has been recently applied for the degradation of phenols pharmaceutics and dyes bertagna silva et al 2021 srikanth et al 2017 as far as the authors know in the literature there are no studies that directly combine microalgae and aops for the treatment of ww the main purposes of this work are 1 investigate the possibility of using four microalgae species c vulgaris a protothecoides s obliquus green microalgae and a maxima cyanobacteria in the treatment of ww when cultivated under mixotrophic and heterotrophic conditions 2 evaluation of the effect of ww on microalgae growth and pigment content chlorophylls and carotenoids compared to autotrophic microalgal cultivation and 3 assess the efficiency of a uv a led lab scale photosystem combined with immobilized tio2 as a post treatment to reach the legal limits of wastewater release in natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater the wastewaters used in this study were collected from a

illuminated with a uv a led photosystem ferreira et al 2020 the reactor had a volume capacity of 110 ml and the uv a led matrix consisted in 12 indium gallium nitride with a nominal consumption of 3 w when the applied current was 700 ma and a peak wavelength λ 365 nm the experiments were carried out with a current intensity of 630 ma corresponding to an uv irradiance of 85 w m2 the led system was fixed above the reactor and equipped with a fan for heat dissipation purposes 2 4 preparation of tio2 photocatalysts tio2 degussa p 25 evonik was used as photocatalyst and was immobilized on cylindrical glass raschig rings d l 0 5 cm by heat attachment method based on the optimized process elsewhere behnajady et al 2008 first the glass surface was treated by hf 1 m overnight and naoh 1 m for 30 min at 90 c to make irregular surface for better contact of tio2 on surface and increase the number of oh groups for higher adhesion to the glass a suspension of 10 g l tio2 p25 was prepared with ethanol and its ph was adjusted to about 3 by hcl 1 m the suspension was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath bandelin sonorex super pk 106 for 15 min to improve the tio2 dispersion and then was poured on the glass rings and allowed to dry in an oven memmert u30 at 90 c after drying the glass rings were calcinated at 500 c for 3 h in a muffle naber industrieofenbau and finally washed with distilled water to remove weakly immobilized particles this process was repeated three times to optimize the load of tio2 p25 on the surface of the glass no more than three coatings were performed taking into account that some catalyst disaggregation can occur when using more than 3 layers of tio2 in raschig rings sampaio et al 2013 the glass rings fig 1 a were weighed before and at the end of the immobilization process to quantify the mass of catalyst immobilized on the glass surface scanning electron microscopy sem pictures of the immobilized photocatalyst were recorded using an environmental scanning electron microscope fei quanta 400 w esem fig 1b show the glass surface with rough morphology with the presence of tio2 particles attached 2 5 experimental setup 2 5 1 microalgae cultivation in winery wastewater different cultivation conditions were carried out table 1 experiments were performed using wws as substrate under mixotrophic and heterotrophic conditions mc and hc respectively four wastewaters ww 1 4 were used with increasing nutrient concentrations table 2 by mixing samples of the collected wastewater and diluting with distilled water cultivation in microalgal inorganic media under autotrophic conditions ac was used as a control for microalgal growth first to investigate if the low ph of the effluent 4 is an inhibitory factor for microalgal growth all microalgae species were cultivated in 100 ml flasks using ww 1 then to evaluate microalgae growth and removal of toc and tn mixotrophic mc and heterotrophic hc studies were performed in 1 l flask using cultivated in ww 1 finally it was assessed the effect of the concentration of wastewater ww 1 to ww 4 on c vulgaris biomass accumulation as well as on cod tn tp and polyphenols removal under mixotrophic conditions mc the volume of inoculum added to the ww was calculated in order to obtain an optical density od around 0 15 0 20 at 540 nm rocha et al 2003 which corresponds to a biomass concentration of approximately 100 mg l 1 od measurements were performed against ww to avoid interference of ww compounds the autotrophic and mixotrophic cultures were kept under continuous illumination light intensity of 20 25 µmol photons m 2 s 1 supplied by a white 7 w led lamp while the heterotrophic were kept in the dark the cultivations were performed in two replicates and ww without microalgae inoculum were used as control all experiments were conducted in erlenmeyer flasks incubated in an orbital shaker new brunswick scientific at 23 2 c under an agitation speed of 100 rpm the assays were conducted until the stationary phase was reached to prevent contamination by environmental microorganisms all the laboratorial material and glassware were autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min inoculations and samplings were performed in aseptic conditions in a biosafety cabinet microflow advanced biosafety cabinet class ii 2 5 2 tio2 uv leds photocatalysis after ww microalgal bioremediation the treated wastewater was filtered 1 6 μm and a post treatment with tio2 based photocatalysis in the led photoreactor was carried out different samples of bioremediated ww were used to assess the effect of the initial cod concentration on the efficiency of the combination of tio2 led system it was evaluated the aop efficiency in terms of toc and polyphenols removal still present in the wastewater after the microalgal bioremediation tio2 supported glass rings were added to the photoreactor until fully cover its bottom surface it was added a mixing unit to the photoreactor and experiments were performed under well mixing conditions in batch mode experiments were carried out at natural ph of the solution and the temperature was in the range of 18 21 c at predetermined times samples were withdrawn from the reactor to monitor the concentration of organic carbon at the end of the treatments the glass rings were washed with distilled water dried overnight at 80 c and weighted to calculate the loss of immobilized tio2 during the process recycle tests of the immobilized tio2 rings was assessed with the same reactor uv led system under the conditions described above 2 6 growth and bioremediation performance monitoring microalgae growth in ww was monitored daily by measuring the od at 540 nm of culture samples and by calculating the biomass ash free dry weight afdw afdw was determined by filtering the samples with a glass microfiber of 1 6 μm pore size drying overnight at 105 c and incinerating in a muffle for 1 h at 550 c the culture ph was measured using a laboratory ph meter crison micro ph 2000 uv vis measurements were carried out in a uv vis jasco v 530 spectrophotometer after filtration of the culture samples the filtrate was collected and characterized in terms of ph toc tn cod tp and polyphenols as described in section 2 1 to evaluate the efficiency of the treatment the ph toc and tn were measured daily and the other parameters were determined only at the start and end of the experiments 2 7 determination of specific growth rate and biomass productivity the maximum specific growth rate µ day 1 was calculated in the linear region of the growth curve according to the equation µ ln x 2 x 1 t 1 where x 1 and x 2 are the afdw at the beginning t 1 and at the end t 2 of the exponential phase biomass productivity px mg l 1 day 1 was calculated by the expression px x 0 t t 0 at time t and t 0 at the beginning of the experiment 2 8 quantification of chlorophylls and carotenoids 1 1 please correct the equations in section 2 7 at the end of the experiments with c vulgaris the biomass produced was quantified in terms of cellular pigments chlorophylls a and b and carotenoids 2 ml of the culture were first concentrated by centrifugation for 10 min at 3500 rpm hettich eba 8s and the pigments were extracted with 90 acetone as described elsewhere marchão et al 2018 the amount of chlorophylls a and b and carotenoids in the total liquid phase collected was spectrophotometrically quantified according to the equations described elsewhere strickland and parsons 1972 and the final pigments concentrations were expressed as milligrams on ash free dry weigh basis 2 9 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using one way analysis of variance anova and differences were considered as significant when p 0 05 average values were compared using tukey s test the statistical analyses were performed using originpro 8 all data are presented as mean and standard error mean se 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the wastewaters table 2 shows that tn and p po4 3 concentrations in the ww were low maximum values of 3 90 and 2 60 mg l 1 respectively and already lower than legal discharge limits 15 and 10 mg l 1 respectively decree law n 236 98 portugal on the other hand cod concentrations stands out and are higher than regulatory discharge limit 150 mg o2 l 1 c n ratios are high within from 159 to 197 whereas n p ratios are very low and within the range from 1 5 to 2 6 these ratios are comparable to those obtained for a winery wastewater derived from the washing after grape processing tsolcha et al 2017 it seems that the wws in this work were n deficient since it is reported that an optimal c n p mass ratio of 46 1 7 7 1 can be deduced for microalgae hillebrand and sommer 1999 and it is suggested that n p ratios higher than 5 and 6 in wastewaters lead to higher biomass productivities chen et al 2012 choi and lee 2015 3 2 influence of winery wastewater ph on microalgal growth since the wws used in this work was acidic ph 4 4 5 it was firstly evaluated if microalgal growth was inhibited on one hand auxenochlorella chlorella and scenedesmus microalgae have optimum growth at circumneutral and alkaline values laying generally between 6 and 9 and on the other hand arthrospira is alkaliphilic and presents the best growth at ph 9 it was observed that after adding microalgae inoculum 5 10 v v to ww 1 ph 4 4 and low orthophosphate concentration table 2 and a low buffer capacity the ph increased to values within optimum range in all microalgae media this is because the inoculum consisted in microalgae suspended in inorganic media which are rich in orthophosphates namely k2hpo4 and kh2po4 with high buffer capacity since the initial ph of all cultures was already within the optimal range fig 2 ww without any ph correction was used in the subsequent studies furthermore an increase of the ph was observed over the incubation period fig 2 most probably due the microalgae assimilation of fatty acids organic and phenolic acids compounds that may contribute with a significantly fraction of cod welz et al 2016 in these effluents 3 3 microalgae screening the growth of the microalgae cultivated under three growth conditions ac hc and mc were determined by calculating the afdw the initial biomass concentration for all microalgae and conditions was calculated to be approximately the same 100 mg afdw l 1 considering the relatively harsh conditions when cultivated in ww an acidic unsterilized and nitrogen limited medium the microalgae showed a good performance under heterotrophic conditions there was a rapid growth after only one day fig 3 with maximal growth rates of 0 60 d 1 for c vulgaris and 0 61 d 1 for a protothecoides achieving higher productivities p 0 05 than both mixotrophic and autotrophic conditions table 3 but despite the initial higher growth rates the overall hc biomass yield was lower than those obtained for the ac and mc conditions the growth stabilized after 1 4 days depending on the species of incubation and started to decline death phase one explanation could be the fact that the unsterile wastewater contains other heterotrophic microorganisms such as bacteria fungi and protozoa which in the dark could out compete the microalgae for nutrients and or have a predatory interaction muñoz and guieysse 2006 additionally the heterotrophic metabolism may require micronutrients or vitamins that may be absent from ww an effluent nutritionally exhausted by the heterotrophs involved in wine making such as yeasts and lactic acid bacteria balmaseda et al 2018 the equilibrium between photoautotrophic and heterotrophic growth is instable for c vulgaris grown in axenic conditions it was suggest that photoautotrophic growth is the preferential growth mechanism under mixotrophic conditions light plus inorganic and organic carbon sources but at high oxygen concentrations the heterotrophic growth pathway is activated manhaeghe et al 2020 under mixotrophic conditions c vulgaris a protothecoides and s obliquus continued to grow well for 8 to 10 days when the stationary phase was reached fig 3 however for a maxima lysis is shown to start after 4 days represented by the decline in the growth curve the exponential phase is generally reached in the first day of incubation but c vulgaris and a protothecoides seem to have a second phase from the third to the fourth day showing a rapid growth maximum growth rate of 0 61 d 1 for c vulgaris in that time span higher maximal biomass concentration and productivities were attained table 3 when compared to phototrophic conditions for the same period of incubation c vulgaris presented the highest biomass concentration p 0 05 other authors also reported that mixotrophic cultivation leads to higher productivities than autotrophic cultivation when microalgae are grown in wastewaters from poultry raisin and winery piggery and dairy industries bhatnagar et al 2011 ribeiro et al 2017 tsolcha et al 2017 it was evaluated the removal of toc and tn along the incubation period of microalgae under heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions fig 4 and maximal removal rates are summarized in table 3 it can be highlighted although is not surprising that nutrient removal rate is proportional to the microalgal biomass production initial toc and cod were approximately 203 and 595 mg l 1 respectively regarding initial tn values were higher than those obtained in the wastewater characterization table 2 this occurs because the microalgae inoculum was suspended in inorganic medium with higher nitrogen content nitrate salts particularly chlorella and spirulina media than ww consequently the inoculum had a significant influence in increasing the initial value of 1 27 to 7 10 mg n l 1 for c vulgaris and a protothecoides and almost 20 mg n l 1 for a maxima the same observation was made for initial tp the fact that microalgae growth benefited from the n and p inputs of the culture medium means that these nutrients are limiting the microalgae growth which can be a drawback in the use of this effluent alone for production of algal biomass microalgae uses photosynthesis as anabolic path produces energy for biosynthesis and growth and respiration and fermentation as catabolic paths uses energy to break down for growth these metabolic processes work together microalgae were able to grow under heterotrophic conditions consuming the organic carbon in the wastewater by respiration and fermentation metabolisms the fixed carbon during photosynthesis stored starch green microalgae or glycogen a maxima are later broken down providing glucose for energy source depending on the species and the growth conditions after glucose has been converted to pyruvate it can be further metabolized by respiration or fermentation both metabolisms described in microalgae mainly in chlorella species hu et al 2018 all species consumed toc rapidly in the initial two days when cultivated under heterotrophic conditions and the removals were similar p 0 05 ranging from 75 to 88 in mixotrophic cultivation the removal was slower fig 4b but the percentages obtained were similar to those in heterotrophic condition except for s obliquus nitrogen was consumed rapidly within the first 2 and 3 days for both growth conditions maximal values were obtained for s obliquus under heterotrophic conditions 97 and c vulgaris under mixotrophic conditions 92 nitrogen is a macronutrient necessary for the synthesis of nucleic acids proteins and energy carrying molecules atp accounting for 1 20 of dry cell mass shahid et al 2020 the nitrogen sources enter the cell by active transport with nitrites no2 n and nitrates no3 n being reduced to ammonium nh4 n after entering the cell which in turn is incorporated into amino acids through the glutamate cycle liu et al 2015 in these wws no3 n was the predominant n source due to input of the inorganic media also part of nitrogen could be removed by nh4 n volatilization gonçalves et al 2017 after the first sharp decrease it is verified an increase of tn tn0 for a maxima under both hc and mc for c vulgaris a protothecoides under hc values for the latter were higher than 1 and are not represented in fig 4c this could be due to cellular death previously mentioned fig 3 similar observation was also made by other authors liu et al 2016 who concluded that dead cells could be responsible for the high tn concentration at the end of some experimental sets the removal in the non inoculated controls unsterilized were 13 for toc and 50 for tn mainly due to fungi proliferation at the end of the microalgal screening experiments it is possible to highlight that mixotrophic conditions are preferable considering the removal and growth parameters c vulgaris and a protothecoides showed significantly higher results for toc and tn removals taking also into account the maximal biomass concentration c vulgaris obtained the highest value p 0 05 and was chosen for further biodegradation studies 3 4 influence of wastewater concentration on growth and bioremediation performance of c vulgaris the concentration of ww was adjusted to have wastewaters with different initial concentrations table 4 to grow c vulgaris by diluting the collected wastewaters with distilled water the initial tn and tp concentration were similar amongst the four wastewaters about 20 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 for n and p respectively after the addition of the same amount of microalgal inoculum containing medium that presented higher nutrient concentrations than ww this agrees with the results of initial tn obtained in another work with ww liu et al 2016 removal of toc fig 5 a was maximum after 6 days for the lower initial concentrations 595 and 1238 mg o2 l 1 ww 1 and 2 and was slower for higher concentrations 1777 and 2441 mg o2 l 1 ww 3 and 4 reaching maximal values after 8 days tn was rapidly consumed within 3 days for all wastewaters fig 5b c vulgaris presented higher growth rates and biomass productivities fig 6 a for increasing concentrations of the effluent pollutant load which is an expected result as more carbon sources are available to consume and accumulate biomass also it may indicate that c vulgaris is resilient to ww toxicity fig 6b shows the influence of initial ww concentration on removal percentages c vulgaris was efficient in removing cod and nitrogen for wws 1 3 cod removal was approximately 90 and for ww 4 was lower p 0 05 but still high 80 tn removal were similar amongst the wws p 0 382 an in the range of 80 to 90 similar results were obtained by other authors when using ww for instance it was achieved a cod reduction of more than 92 by the co culture chlorella vulgaris and arthrospira platensis spennati et al 2020 diplosphaera sp was used for bioremediation of diluted ww liu et al 2016 and it was attained 90 and 70 removal for cod and tn respectively moreover using a leptolyngbya based microbial consortium maximum removal of 86 for cod and 84 for tn were observed tsolcha et al 2017 phosphorus is another important macronutrient second only to nitrogen and participates in the nucleic acids cellular membrane structure phosphorylation reactions atp regeneration in addition to the cell division reactions shahid et al 2020 microalgae can assimilate this nutrient in the orthophosphate forms h2po4 and hpo4 2 through phosphorylation gonçalves et al 2017 however mendonça et al 2021 concluded that phosphorus removal from wastewaters in algal systems may be often difficult with most results less than 35 removal by analysing initial and final concentrations table 4 the mass of p removed by c vulgaris is similar p 0 05 for all the tested wws removal percentages are in the range of 36 to 47 being maximal for ww 4 fig 6b a similar percentage 36 was obtained with the cultivation of chlorella sp in a winery wastewater ganeshkumar et al 2018 tp removal could have been not only due to metabolic uptake of orthophosphate but also due to ph mediated processes as for ph values above 8 phosphorus precipitation can occur gonçalves et al 2017 under light the removal of p by c vulgaris depends on the initial n concentration in wastewater beuckels et al 2015 in this work all the four ww had similar initial n concentration around 20 mg l 1 but the percentage of p removal was higher although not significantly in ww 4 that had a higher initial n phenolic compounds are considered toxic to many microorganisms but can also be considered as carbon and energy sources the metabolism involved is not yet completely understood but is suggested that microalgae can remove phenolic compounds by mineralization to carbon dioxide or biochemical modification to other compounds lindner and pleissner 2019 there is some evidence that microalgae can remove efficiently phenols from ww in the work by spennati et al 2020 with the co culture of c vulgaris and a platensis polyphenols were reduced by more than 50 although the polyphenolic content in wws in this work was low considering the normal values mean of 205 mg l for these effluents ioannou et al 2015 c vulgaris achieved no more than 40 removal maximum value registered for ww 3 polyphenols removal in ww 1 was not evaluated as the initial concentration was already below the legal limit for wastewater discharge however it is important to note that the removal for the selected parameters could have also been accomplished by other microorganisms since the cultures were not sterilized in reality treatment systems include a complex mixture of bacteria along with algae among other interactions aerobic bacteria degrade organic pollutants by respiration using the o2 produced by microalgae and in turn release the co2 necessary for microalgal photosynthesis muñoz and guieysse 2006 final cod concentrations for ww 3 and ww 4 despite the high removals and polyphenols for ww 2 ww 3 and ww 4 were still above the legal limits for wastewater discharge decree law 236 98 portugal of 150 mg o2 l 1 and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively consequently there is the need for a post treatment step to improve the quality of the final discharge 3 5 pigment accumulation during c vulgaris mixotrophic bioremediation of wastewaters due to high quality requirements biomass produced from wastewater is not suitable to produce high value chemicals for food medical or cosmetic application but it can be used for animal feed in particular cultivation of chlorella has been used for the production of pigments as natural colouring ingredients for feed formulation in aquaculture and poultry guedes et al 2011 and there are some examples in the literature that use wastewater for that purpose olguín 2012 ribeiro et al 2017 the final content of chlorophylls a and b and carotenoids in c vulgaris cultivated ww was determined fig 7 chlorophyll contents of c vulgaris grown in ww are lower than the value obtained in the autotrophic condition 27 80 mg g 1 the reduction in chlorophyll production by mixotrophic chlorella compared to autotrophic cultures was also observed by other authors using ww ganeshkumar et al 2018 and other carbon sources such as glucose and dairy wastewater cheirsilp and torpee 2012 ribeiro et al 2017 moreover there was a decrease of chlorophylls with the increase of initial organic carbon concentration in ww with significant changes for ww 2 4 a maximum of 20 90 mg g 1 was obtained in ww 1 it was observed a green colour loss in the cultures that were grown in higher concentrations of ww because of the lower chlorophyll production it was found that organic substrates have a negative effect on the formation of the photosynthetic apparatus leading to a significant reduction in terms of photosynthetic capacity of microalgal cells yang et al 2000 even inhibiting photosynthesis at high toc concentrations chandra et al 2014 it is worth noting that polyphenols organic compounds frequently associated to cell oxidative stress are under the detection limit in ww1 but steadily increase in ww2 ww4 2 and 4 fold c vulgaris is sensitive to high concentrations of phenolic compounds in particular when the cultures were grown under phototrophic or heterotrophic conditions the toxicity was reversed or alleviated upon mixotrophic growth of the cultures megharaj et al 1992 conditions selected in this work regarding carotenoids content it was found that the values increased when growing c vulgaris in ww although not significantly p 0 05 compared to autotrophism 6 54 mg g 1 except for ww 4 biomass cultivated in ww 1 shows the higher content 8 65 mg g 1 it is known that microalgae under environmental stress may increase their carotenoids content as a response of cell oxidative response guedes et al 2011 also the carotenoid profile may be altered as astaxanthin that is synthesized by microalgae under nitrogen starvation ip et al 2004 condition verified in the wastewaters used in this work in future studies in addition to pigments other components of the biomass should be analysed as other metabolic pathways besides carotenogenesis can be shifted under nitrogen starvation such as enhanced lipid synthesis and triglyceride accumulation shahid et al 2020 many microalgae including c vulgaris produce transesterificable lipids in mixotrophic conditions that can be used as biodiesel arora and philippidis 2021 tsolcha et al 2017 3 6 tio2 uv led photocatalysis 3 6 1 post treatment of ww after microalgae bioremediation and biomass removal treated wastewater was collected and sampled to obtain different initial concentrations sets a b and c table 5 before applying photocatalysis the catalyst load was constant by using the same amount of tio2 coated rings n inside of the reactor almost no degradation was verified when tio2 is absent 2 using uncoated rings only uv a leds photolysis photocatalytic efficiency was evaluated in terms of toc removal over time fig 8 initial degradation of toc follows a pseudo first order kinetics described by 1 d toc d t k toc where toc is toc concentration k is the kinetic constant and t is the reaction time the integration of eq 1 gives 2 ln toc toc 0 k t where toc 0 corresponds to toc concentration at t 0 a linear fitting of eq 2 to the data obtained gave the kinetic constants fig 8 removal of toc was slower with the increase of the initial organic carbon concentration however final cod values were below 150 mg o2 l 1 which complies with the legislation phenols degradation were high 100 for experimental set b and 80 for c but final concentration for set c was still above the legal value table 5 the principal reactions leading to pollutant decomposition involves hydroxyl radicals oh which are extremely powerful and non selective oxidants capable of oxidizing most organics compounds in particular phenols degradation occurs when oh attacks the phenol ring yielding catechol resorcinol hydroquinone and benzoquinone an then the rings in these compounds break up to give organic acids and finally co2 guo et al 2006 sampaio et al 2013 according to pawar and lee 2015 the generation of radicals in photocatalysis with titanium dioxide are as follows 3 ti o 2 h v h e 4 h h 2 o o h h 5 h o h o h 6 e o 2 o 2 7 o 2 h h o 2 a more efficient photocatalytic process could be achieved by using an oxidant agent such as hydrogen peroxide however this would increase the cost of the process at the end of each experiment the amount of tio2 that was lost in the process and photocatalyst washing was not significant 1 to 3 meaning that the adhesion technique of tio2 to the glass support was successful 3 6 2 recycle test to assess the durability of tio2 coating reutilization tests were performed using the same tio2 coated rings applied to a sample set a of microalgae treated winery wastewater see section 3 6 1 results fig 9 show that the photocatalytic activity of immobilized tio2 did not decrease considerable after 5 cycles 4 conclusions winery wastewater can be successfully used for the growth of microalgae mixotrophic cultivation of c vulgaris showed the best potential for its application in both bioremediation of these wastewaters and biomass productivity able to remove above 80 of cod and tn content and produce 49 5 mg afdw l 1 d 1 our data suggest that growing c vulgaris in ww could be a cost effective approach not only for removal of pollutants but also for producing valuable biomass e g carotenoids to be applied in feed formulation nevertheless future research is required to improve the bioremediation process as the biomass yield as wws are nitrogen deprived the accumulation of lipids could be enhanced so the final biomass quality should be researched in future work towards biofuel biodiesel production for wastewaters with a higher organic load applying uv leds photocatalysis as post treatment could help to clean up ww that will be discharged into the environment and improve global efficiency the system used was efficient in degrading polyphenols above 80 of degradation for which c vulgaris showed the lower removal percentages among ww pollutants using tio2 immoblized raschig rings economic viability of the process could be improved due to the ease at separating the catalyst at the end of experiments and its reutilization with insignificant mass losses immobilized tio2 can be reused for four times without any considerable loss of its photocatalytic activity declaration of

16686,the degradation of coastal water quality from fecal pollution poses a health risk to visitors at recreational beaches fecal indicator bacteria fib are a proxy for fecal pollution however the accuracy of their representation of fecal pollution health risks at recreational beaches impacted by non point sources is disputed due to non human derivation this study aimed to investigate the relationship between fib and a range of culturable and molecular based microbial source tracking mst markers and pathogenic bacteria and physicochemical parameters and rainfall forty two marine water samples were collected from seven sampling stations during six events at two tourist beaches in thailand both beaches were contaminated with fecal pollution as evident from the genbac3 marker at 88 100 detection and up to 8 71 log10 copies 100 ml the human specific mst marker human polyomaviruses jc and bk hpyvs at up to 4 33 log10 copies 100 ml with 92 94 positive detection indicated that human sewage was likely the main contamination source crassphage showed lower frequencies and concentrations its correlations with the fib group i e total coliforms fecal coliforms and enterococci and genbac3 diminished its use as a human specific mst marker for coastal water human specific culturable aim06 and sr14 bacteriophages and general fecal indicator coliphages also showed less sensitivity than the human specific molecular assays the applicability of the genbac3 endpoint pcr assay as a lower cost prescreening step prior to the genbac3 qpcr assay was supported by its 100 positive predictive value but its limited negative predictive values required subsequent qpcr confirmation human enteric adenovirus and vibrio cholerae were not found in any of the samples the hpyvs related to vibrio parahaemolyticus vibrio vulnificus and 5 d rainfall records all of which were more prevalent and concentrated during the wet season more monitoring is therefore recommended during wet periods temporal differences but no spatial differences were observed suggesting the need for a sentinel site at each beach for routine monitoring the exceedance of fib water quality standards did not indicate increased prevalence or concentrations of the hpyvs or vibrio spp pathogen group so the utility of fib as an indicator of health risks at tropical beaches maybe challenged accurate assessment of fecal pollution by incorporating mst markers could lead to developing a more effective water quality monitoring plan to better protect human health risks in tropical recreational beaches graphical

2018b 2018a fib and mst markers are beneficial for monitoring recreational beaches affected by both human and non human non point sources powers et al 2020 shrestha et al 2020 mst markers have also been used to identify sources and guide short term interventions to reduce microbial contamination and the exceedance of beach water quality standards nevers et al 2018 moreover the importance of their ability to identify contamination sources has been recognized by local regulatory agencies which led to the initiation of an mst monitoring study and the use of technology for routine monitoring sinigalliano et al 2021 two marine tourist beaches were identified for inclusion in this study one beach beach bs is more popular among local residents and thai natives while the other beach beach pt

parahaemolyticus table s6 and significant differences between sampling events were noticed for all five detectable gene markers table s7 crassphage was more frequently detectable in the dry season whereas both v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus showed higher positive rates in the wet season table s8 significantly higher concentrations of hpyvs v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus were evident in the wet season than the dry season 3 5 correlation and multivariate analyses among the 20 quantifiable parameters beach bs showed significantly strong correlations rho 0 70 1 00 in 14 pairs of the parameters and significantly moderate correlations rho 0 50 0 70 in 22 pairs fig s2a with only microbial parameters in fig 4 a crassphage showed a moderate inverse correlation with do but a strong positive correlation with conductivity v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus both indicated an inverse correlation with salinity but a positive correlation with temperature v vulnificus also had a moderate inverse correlation with tss the fib group demonstrated moderate to strong correlations with genbac3 and crassphage the aim06 bacteriophages were moderately correlated with the enterococci coliphages and crassphage genbac3 also showed a moderate correlation with crassphage both v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus were strongly correlated with the hpyvs noticeably the sr14 bacteriophages did not show significant correlations with any of the microbiological parameters the 1 d and 5 d cumulative rainfall was significantly correlated with the hpyvs v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus for beach pt less significant relationships were observed between the parameters with five pairs having strong relationships and seven pairs having moderate correlations fig s2b with only microbial parameters in fig 4b none of the microbiological parameters correlated with any of the parameters aside from strong correlations of total coliforms and fecal coliforms and moderate correlations of genbac3 with salinity and conductivity the 5 and 7 d rainfall records significantly correlated with the total coliforms fecal coliforms and crassphage fig s2b the associated water quality parameters were grouped into clusters fig 5 both beaches presented closely related parameters for five subgroups 1 total coliforms fecal coliforms and enterococci 2 genbac3 and conductivity 3 v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus and 4 aim06 bacteriophages sr14 bacteriophages and coliphages rainfall was related to the hpyvs v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus at beach bs but total coliforms fecal coliforms and enterococci at beach pt moreover the multivariate analysis categorized the samples into two main clusters predominantly by sampling events fig 6 beach bs demonstrated two groups comprising events 1 3 and 4 6 fig 6a while beach pt represented one cluster for events 1 and 5 and another for events 2 3 4 and 6 fig 6b furthermore exceedance of the fib standards did not increase the likelihood of finding mst markers genbac3 hpyvs and crassphage or pathogens v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus as indicated by the odds ratios table 1 for beach bs genbac3 had significantly higher concentrations in the samples that exceeded the total coliforms and enterococci standards while v parahaemolyticus showed significantly higher concentrations in the samples that exceeded the total and fecal coliforms standards table 1 4 discussion 4 1 prevalence and concentrations of mst markers and pathogens in beach water this study examined fib mst markers and pathogens at two recreational beaches in thailand the general fecal marker genbac3 and the human specific marker hpyvs indicated that the two beaches were mostly contaminated by fecal pollution particularly human fecal sources notably previous studies in thailand have shown higher concentrations of crassphage than hpyvs in human sewage influents of municipal wastewater treatment plants and freshwater as well as significantly higher correlations between the two markers in wastewater recalculated to spearman s rho of 0 6458 and freshwater recalculated to spearman s rho of 0 7390 sangkaew et al 2021 however in this study crassphage was detected less frequently and at lower concentrations than the hpyvs at both beaches and no correlations between the two genetic markers were observed implying different behavior in marine water it has been speculated that the faster decay characteristics or less dna stability of crassphage dna compared to hpyvs dna in tropical marine environments account for its low detection as evident by strong effect of temperature on the decay rates of the crassphage marker than other culturable and qpcr markers ahmed et al 2019b ballesté et al 2019 2018 also indicated in beach bs moderate correlation between crassphage and the fib group i e total coliforms fecal coliforms and enterococci may suggest higher decay rates or lower stability of crassphage than other dna based qpcr markers which has been previously shown to be almost similarly to fib group greaves et al 2020 given the low detection rates and concentrations of crassphage together with its relationship with the general mst marker genbac3 and the fib group crassphage appeared to be less suitable as a human specific mst marker than hpyvs in the two studied marine beaches the use of culturable mst groups such as bacteriophages have the advantages of being relatively low cost and simple methods the human specific bacteriophages aim06 and sr14 have previously proved to be useful in assessing polluted urban canals and a moderately polluted river in thailand chyerochana et al 2020 wangkahad et al 2017 however fewer positive rates 8 3 16 7 were observed for the marine beaches in this study moreover the recovery efficiencies of both phages in seawater samples 29 5 92 9 were lower than those in the freshwater samples 49 6 99 6 chyerochana et al 2020 which could be one of the factors contributing to the more frequently undetectable results in this study total coliphages were also detected at positive rates of 8 3 and 38 9 at beaches bs and pt respectively at up to one order of magnitude male specific f and somatic coliphages have been detected in influents of municipal wastewater treatment facilities in thailand at an order of magnitude of up to four in pfu 100 ml sirikanchana et al 2020 and f specific rna coliphages have been found in domestic thai wastewater also up to four orders of magnitude in pfu 100 ml claydong et al 2001 the accelerated decay of bacteriophages in marine environments could be attributed to factors such as the types of bacteriophages temperature and water constituents booncharoen et al 2018 us epa 2015 with low concentrations in environmental water bacteriophage monitoring may benefit from detection methods involving high volumes of water méndez et al 2020 us epa 2018 vibrio spp are pathogenic bacteria that cause diarrhea sepsis and dermatitis and are found in marine environments in thailand siriphap et al 2017 thongchankaew et al 2011 thongjun et al 2013 with the increasing incidence of vibrio spp in marine waters with warmer temperatures due to climate change baker austin et al 2016 weiskerger et al 2019 vibrio spp are important marine pathogens that could negatively affect public health following recreational exposure dickinson et al 2013 jiang 2001 hypothesized that vibrio spp were more affected by environmental conditions than fecal pollution due to their low correlation with fecal indicators however in this study both v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus correlated well with the hpyvs the human fecal pollution marker at beach bs indicating an interesting relationship with human fecal pollution nutrient contents potentially contributed by wastewater could promote growth of vibrio spp dickinson et al 2013 moreover optimal salinity ranges for vibrio spp have been suggested jiang 2001 and both vibrio spp were inversely associated with salinity and tss in this study although hadv40 41 were not detectable in any beach water samples in this study its presence in raw sewage and treated wastewater at the adjacent municipal wastewater treatment plants suggested the dilution effect in beach water to below the detection method capability sirikanchana et al 2020 4 2 implications of beach water quality monitoring campaigns the findings from comprehensive microbial monitoring and multivariate analyses could guide the development of localized beach water quality monitoring plans the correlation analysis and odds ratios in this study revealed no associations in terms of frequency or concentrations between fib and the mst markers and pathogens which is in line with reports from other geographical settings powers et al 2020 sauer et al 2011 the high concentrations of fib could have resulted from non point source fecal input including stormwater runoff aging sanitary sewer infrastructure human bathing sand re suspension and animal fecal contributors bradshaw et al 2016 fewtrell and kay 2015 nevers et al 2018 solo gabriele et al 2000 beach bs is more popular among local residents and thai natives while beach pt has facilities accommodation and department stores that are better suited to foreign visitors both beaches have food stalls and beach chairs along their beachfronts and pigeons waterfowls and stray dogs have been observed combined sewer overflows receiving both wastewater and stormwater runoff are located next to the beaches moreover different hydrological patterns at each beach as affected by tides and beach geology could play important roles in dissipating pollution from land to sea or transporting pollution from ships to the shorelines jang et al 2020 price et al 2021 consequently the use of fib could be inappropriate to indicate fecal pollution and to guide policy and management plans aimed at reducing the health risks to beach visitors this study demonstrated that the human specific mst marker hpyvs was the most suitable marker for indicating human fecal pollution at the two studied beaches although no regulatory standard values for mst markers are available mst marker concentrations could be transformed into quantified risks based on a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra framework boehm et al 2018 the results of this study highlight the need for the inclusion of pathogenic vibrio spp in the monitoring campaigns at these two beaches and this could further inform potential public health risks in accordance with the qmra calculation from genetic material data dickinson et al 2013 in the future other pathogens of local concern should also be monitored and the relationships between the pathogens and mst markers should be further evaluated to provide a better understanding of pollution sources and public health risks mordecai et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the use of the qpcr technique in routine monitoring is being increasingly acknowledged as able to provide prompt results regarding health risks associated with pollution and the appropriate facilities sampling and laboratory systems staffing and budgets are needed to support its wide application shrestha and dorevitch 2020 laboratories at regional academic institutions in proximity of 1 d sample transportation could be options for setting up a pilot campaign for routine water quality monitoring promisingly modeling approaches can be used to predict real time microbial parameters from related data and measurements francy et al 2020 searcy and boehm 2021 furthermore the genbac3 pcr could be used as a prescreening tool for general fecal pollution monitoring prior to the use of genbac3 qpcr given the 100 confidence of positive genbac3 pcr results however subsequent qpcr confirmation would be required due to the low confidence in negative genbac3 pcr results this study tested only two endpoint pcr markers genbac3 and crassphage the availability of these developed and validated assays was due to their effective prescreening for general and human specific fecal pollution in freshwater environments somnark et al 2018b however the development and validation of endpoint pcr hpyvs v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus are also needed to offer a prescreening method in marine settings with low costs and a lower requirement for technical skills and instruments the current official beach water quality monitoring program in thailand is conducted by the governmental agency to assess the microbial indicators i e total coliforms fecal coliforms and enterococci at all 211 stations twice a year covering both dry and wet seasons pcd 2019 the results of this monitoring program indicate the state of water quality for the purpose of environmental conservation due to the less pronounced spatial distribution of microbial parameters a sentinel site at each beach could be selected we recommend the current pcd monitoring sites at station b for beach bs and either station d or f for beach pt pcd 2019 more frequent monitoring is essential to assess public health risks particularly for tourists visiting the beaches this study showed the temporal variability in physicochemical and microbial parameters so efforts should be made to sample the water more frequently particularly during the rainy season as we found higher concentrations of hpyvs v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus during this period the european union 2006 requires bathing water to be monitored more frequently than once a month during the bathing season while the us epa 2012 recommends weekly sampling or more tropical beaches on the other hand are visited by tourists throughout the year and the monitoring plan should therefore be well managed to balance the costs and budgets while simultaneously protecting the public from health risks during recreational exposure with the changing climate which will induce higher frequency and intensity precipitation the effects of rainfall especially on non point sources are expected to increase wang et al 2020 in this study the microbial parameters were positively correlated with the 1 and 5 d cumulative rainfall at beach bs but no significant relationship was found at beach pt possibly due to lighter rainfall or stormwater so there was not a significant pollution source at this beach different study sites may be affected by varying accumulated rainfall periods due to the differences in point and non point sources runoff patterns beach geology hydrological patterns and other factors an association between microbial parameters and rainfall records with a range of 12 h 4 d cumulative rainfall prior to sampling has been shown brooks et al 2020 gonzález fernández et al 2021 jennings et al 2018 shrestha et al 2020 wu et al 2021 the localized effects of rainfall should therefore be investigated so that these results can be used to guide recommendations aimed at limiting health risks for example by advising people to avoid recreational activities at marine beaches for certain periods after rainfall events findings from this study underscore the necessity to investigate spatial and temporal distributions of as well as relationship among source tracking indicators and pathogens of concerns in addition to fib indicators for guiding microbial water quality monitoring management plans in tropical marine beaches 5 conclusions nineteen quantitative and two qualitative parameters were analyzed at seven stations for six sampling events n 42 at two recreational marine beaches in thailand the majority 72 2 95 8 of the total coliforms and fecal coliforms but a relatively lower portion 37 5 38 9 of enterococci passed the microbial marine water quality standards at each beach however the fib exceedance rates and concentrations did not correlate with the intensity or the increased odds of detection rates of human specific mst markers and pathogens fecal contamination was omnipresent at both beaches as shown by the genbac3 qpcr marker human sewage was deemed the main pollution source as identified by the human specific marker hpyvs which was more prevalent and concentrated than the human specific marker crassphage however crassphage had a moderate correlation with genbac3 and stronger correlation to fib at beach bs consequently further analysis is required and more sites need to be sampled the human specific culturable aim06 and sr14 phages and general fecal indicator coliphages were not suitable as proxies for beach water quality monitoring due to their low detection rates and concentrations the applicability of the genbac3 endpoint pcr assay as a lower cost prescreening step prior to the genbac3 qpcr assay was supported by its 100 positive predictive value however the negative endpoint pcr results indicated the need for further qpcr confirmation human pathogens were measured and neither human adenovirus types 40 41 or v cholerae were detected in any of the samples v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus correlated with hpyvs and monitoring is thus recommended temporal differences but no spatial differences were observed which suggests a sentinel site is required for water quality monitoring as well as a higher sampling frequency especially during the rainy season as higher concentrations of hpyvs v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus were observed during the wet periods in this study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

16686,the degradation of coastal water quality from fecal pollution poses a health risk to visitors at recreational beaches fecal indicator bacteria fib are a proxy for fecal pollution however the accuracy of their representation of fecal pollution health risks at recreational beaches impacted by non point sources is disputed due to non human derivation this study aimed to investigate the relationship between fib and a range of culturable and molecular based microbial source tracking mst markers and pathogenic bacteria and physicochemical parameters and rainfall forty two marine water samples were collected from seven sampling stations during six events at two tourist beaches in thailand both beaches were contaminated with fecal pollution as evident from the genbac3 marker at 88 100 detection and up to 8 71 log10 copies 100 ml the human specific mst marker human polyomaviruses jc and bk hpyvs at up to 4 33 log10 copies 100 ml with 92 94 positive detection indicated that human sewage was likely the main contamination source crassphage showed lower frequencies and concentrations its correlations with the fib group i e total coliforms fecal coliforms and enterococci and genbac3 diminished its use as a human specific mst marker for coastal water human specific culturable aim06 and sr14 bacteriophages and general fecal indicator coliphages also showed less sensitivity than the human specific molecular assays the applicability of the genbac3 endpoint pcr assay as a lower cost prescreening step prior to the genbac3 qpcr assay was supported by its 100 positive predictive value but its limited negative predictive values required subsequent qpcr confirmation human enteric adenovirus and vibrio cholerae were not found in any of the samples the hpyvs related to vibrio parahaemolyticus vibrio vulnificus and 5 d rainfall records all of which were more prevalent and concentrated during the wet season more monitoring is therefore recommended during wet periods temporal differences but no spatial differences were observed suggesting the need for a sentinel site at each beach for routine monitoring the exceedance of fib water quality standards did not indicate increased prevalence or concentrations of the hpyvs or vibrio spp pathogen group so the utility of fib as an indicator of health risks at tropical beaches maybe challenged accurate assessment of fecal pollution by incorporating mst markers could lead to developing a more effective water quality monitoring plan to better protect human health risks in tropical recreational beaches graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial source tracking fecal indicator bacteria bacteriophage qpcr tropical beaches seawater 1 introduction the marine and coastal tourism industry had

been used to identify sources and guide short term interventions to reduce microbial contamination and the exceedance of beach water quality standards nevers et al 2018 moreover the importance of their ability to identify contamination sources has been recognized by local regulatory agencies which led to the initiation of an mst monitoring study and the use of technology for routine monitoring sinigalliano et al 2021 two marine tourist beaches were identified for inclusion in this study one beach beach bs is more popular among local residents and thai natives while the other beach beach pt

levels of traditional fecal indicators are shown in fig 2 and tables s4 s5 of the samples from beach bs n 18 and beach pt n 24 the majority passed the thailand coastal water quality standards for total coliforms 77 8 and 95 8 for beaches bs and pt respectively and fecal coliforms 72 2 and 91 7 for beaches bs and pt respectively while lower percentages were observed for enterococci 38 9 and 37 5 for beaches bs and pt respectively overall no significant differences were observed between the two beaches for these indicators but the total and fecal coliforms were significantly different at a few sites table s6 while the total and fecal coliforms were significantly lower for event 6 table s7 no significant differences were observed between the seasons for all three parameters table s8 3 2 bacteriophages as mst markers aim06 and sr14 bacteriophages and coliphages were detected at 16 7 11 1 and 38 9 respectively at beach bs and all three phages at 8 3 at beach pt fig 2a and tables s4 s5 no significant differences in spatial and temporal distribution of the phages were observed tables s4 s7 the concentrations of each phage in the different seasons were also not statistically different table s8 however the aim06 bacteriophages and coliphages demonstrated higher positive rates in the dry season 19 0 and 28 6 respectively than in the wet season 4 8 and 14 3 respectively the sr14 bacteriophages were detected more frequently in the wet season 14 3 than in the dry season 4 8 3 3 endpoint pcr assays for dna based mst markers the endpoint pcr assays were tested in 37 samples due to the availability of dna templates the genbac3 pcr and crassphage pcr assays demonstrated positive rates of 56 8 and 16 3 respectively the genbac3 and crassphage endpoint pcr markers were simultaneously present in 16 3 of the samples and were detected at higher rates for beach pt 70 0 and 30 0 than beach bs 41 2 and 0 table s4 the genbac3 pcr showed lower positive rates in the dry season 50 0 than in the wet season 61 9 while the crassphage pcr demonstrated higher positive rates in the dry season 31 3 than in the wet season 4 8 table s8 the genbac3 qpcr marker was quantifiable in 35 of the 37 samples 94 6 and the crassphage qpcr marker in 21 of the 37 samples 56 8 the endpoint pcr showed 62 2 agreement 23 of 37 with the qpcr for genbac3 and 48 7 18 of 37 for crassphage indicating slight agreements by cohen s kappa analysis kappa 0 14 and 0 06 when using pcr as a prescreening step for the genbac3 assay the ppv and npv were 1 00 and 0 125 respectively fig 3 accordingly for the genbac3 marker a pcr positive sample could provide 100 confidence of qpcr presence but only 12 5 confidence in the case of qpcr absence the crassphage pcr assay provided 66 7 confidence of a qpcr positive sample and 45 2 confidence of qpcr negative results ppv 0 667 and npv 0 452 the endpoint pcr genbac3 provided 100 ppvs for both beaches but npvs of 20 and 0 for beach bs and beach pt respectively the endpoint pcr crassphage demonstrated 0 and 66 7 ppvs and 58 8 and 28 6 npvs for beach bs and beach pt respectively 3 4 qpcr assays for dna based mst markers and pathogens a total of 41 dna samples n 17 for beach bs and n 24 for beach pt were processed as sample processing controls for the qpcr assays with one neglected due to erroneous qpcr results in all the qpcr assays including the sketa22 qpcr table s9 the highest positive rates were genbac3 88 2 for beach bs and 100 for beach pt followed by hpyvs 94 1 for beach bs and 91 7 for beach pt crassphage 41 2 for beach bs and 66 7 for beach pt v parahaemolyticus 100 for beach bs and 70 8 for beach pt and v vulnificus 52 9 for beach bs and 29 2 for beach and pt fig 2b and tables s4 s5 all the samples were non detectable for hadv40 41 and v cholerae the most concentrated gene copies present in the same samples were genbac3 max 8 71 log10 copies 100 ml v parahaemolyticus max 5 68 log10 copies 100 ml v vulnificus max 4 80 log10 copies 100 ml hpyvs max 4 33 log10 copies 100 ml and crassphage max 3 51 log10 copies 100 ml paired prentice wilcoxon test p 0 05 higher crassphage was found at beach pt while significantly higher v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus were at beach bs fig 2b and tables s4 s5 significant differences were observed between certain sites for genbac3 crassphage and v parahaemolyticus table s6 and significant differences between sampling events were noticed for all five detectable gene markers table s7 crassphage was more frequently detectable in the dry season whereas both v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus showed higher positive rates in the wet season table s8 significantly higher concentrations of hpyvs v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus were evident in the wet season than the dry season 3 5 correlation and multivariate analyses among the 20 quantifiable parameters beach bs showed significantly strong correlations rho 0 70 1 00 in 14 pairs of the parameters and significantly moderate correlations rho 0 50 0 70 in 22 pairs fig s2a with only microbial parameters in fig 4 a crassphage showed a moderate inverse correlation with do but a strong positive correlation with conductivity v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus both indicated an inverse correlation with salinity but a positive correlation with temperature v vulnificus also had a moderate inverse correlation with tss the fib group demonstrated moderate to strong correlations with genbac3 and crassphage the aim06 bacteriophages were moderately correlated with the enterococci coliphages and crassphage genbac3 also showed a moderate correlation with crassphage both v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus were strongly correlated with the hpyvs noticeably the sr14 bacteriophages did not show significant correlations with any of the microbiological parameters the 1 d and 5 d cumulative rainfall was significantly correlated with the hpyvs v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus for beach pt less significant relationships were observed between the parameters with five pairs having strong relationships and seven pairs having moderate correlations fig s2b with only microbial parameters in fig 4b none of the microbiological parameters correlated with any of the parameters aside from strong correlations of total coliforms and fecal coliforms and moderate correlations of genbac3 with salinity and conductivity the 5 and 7 d rainfall records significantly correlated with the total coliforms fecal coliforms and crassphage fig s2b the associated water quality parameters were grouped into clusters fig 5 both beaches presented closely related parameters for five subgroups 1 total coliforms fecal coliforms and enterococci 2 genbac3 and conductivity 3 v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus and 4 aim06 bacteriophages sr14 bacteriophages and coliphages rainfall was related to the hpyvs v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus at beach bs but total coliforms fecal coliforms and enterococci at beach pt moreover the multivariate analysis categorized the samples into two main clusters predominantly by sampling events fig 6 beach bs demonstrated two groups comprising events 1 3 and 4 6 fig 6a while beach pt represented one cluster for events 1 and 5 and another for events 2 3 4 and 6 fig 6b furthermore exceedance of the fib standards did not increase the likelihood of finding mst markers genbac3 hpyvs and crassphage or pathogens v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus as indicated by the odds ratios table 1 for beach bs genbac3 had significantly higher concentrations in the samples that exceeded the total coliforms and enterococci standards while v parahaemolyticus showed significantly higher concentrations in the samples that exceeded the total and fecal coliforms standards table 1 4 discussion 4 1 prevalence and concentrations of mst markers and pathogens in beach water this study examined fib mst markers and pathogens at two recreational beaches in thailand the general fecal marker genbac3 and the human specific marker hpyvs indicated that the two beaches were mostly contaminated by fecal pollution particularly human fecal sources notably previous studies in thailand have shown higher concentrations of crassphage than hpyvs in human sewage influents of municipal wastewater treatment plants and freshwater as well as significantly higher correlations between the two markers in wastewater recalculated to spearman s rho of 0 6458 and freshwater recalculated to spearman s rho of 0 7390 sangkaew et al 2021 however in this study crassphage was detected less frequently and at lower concentrations than the hpyvs at both beaches and no correlations between the two genetic markers were observed implying different behavior in marine water it has been speculated that the faster decay characteristics or less dna stability of crassphage dna compared to hpyvs dna in tropical marine environments account for its low detection as evident by strong effect of temperature on the decay rates of the crassphage marker than other culturable and qpcr markers ahmed et al 2019b ballesté et al 2019 2018 also indicated in beach bs moderate correlation between crassphage and the fib group i e total coliforms fecal coliforms and enterococci may suggest higher decay rates or lower stability of crassphage than other dna based qpcr markers which has been previously shown to be almost similarly to fib group greaves et al 2020 given the low detection rates and concentrations of crassphage together with its relationship with the general mst marker genbac3 and the fib group crassphage appeared to be less suitable as a human specific mst marker than hpyvs in the two studied marine beaches the use of culturable mst groups such as bacteriophages have the advantages of being relatively low cost and simple methods the human specific bacteriophages aim06 and sr14 have previously proved to be useful in assessing polluted urban canals and a moderately polluted river in thailand chyerochana et al 2020 wangkahad et al 2017 however fewer positive rates 8 3 16 7 were observed for the marine beaches in this study moreover the recovery efficiencies of both phages in seawater samples 29 5 92 9 were lower than those in the freshwater samples 49 6 99 6 chyerochana et al 2020 which could be one of the factors contributing to the more frequently undetectable results in this study total coliphages were also detected at positive rates of 8 3 and 38 9 at beaches bs and pt respectively at up to one order of magnitude male specific f and somatic coliphages have been detected in influents of municipal wastewater treatment facilities in thailand at an order of magnitude of up to four in pfu 100 ml sirikanchana et al 2020 and f specific rna coliphages have been found in domestic thai wastewater also up to four orders of magnitude in pfu 100 ml claydong et al 2001 the accelerated decay of bacteriophages in marine environments could be attributed to factors such as the types of bacteriophages temperature and water constituents booncharoen et al 2018 us epa 2015 with low concentrations in environmental water bacteriophage monitoring may benefit from detection methods involving high volumes of water méndez et al 2020 us epa 2018 vibrio spp are pathogenic bacteria that cause diarrhea sepsis and dermatitis and are found in marine environments in thailand siriphap et al 2017 thongchankaew et al 2011 thongjun et al 2013 with the increasing incidence of vibrio spp in marine waters with warmer temperatures due to climate change baker austin et al 2016 weiskerger et al 2019 vibrio spp are important marine pathogens that could negatively affect public health following recreational exposure dickinson et al 2013 jiang 2001 hypothesized that vibrio spp were more affected by environmental conditions than fecal pollution due to their low correlation with fecal indicators however in this study both v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus correlated well with the hpyvs the human fecal pollution marker at beach bs indicating an interesting relationship with human fecal pollution nutrient contents potentially contributed by wastewater could promote growth of vibrio spp dickinson et al 2013 moreover optimal salinity ranges for vibrio spp have been suggested jiang 2001 and both vibrio spp were inversely associated with salinity and tss in this study although hadv40 41 were not detectable in any beach water samples in this study its presence in raw sewage and treated wastewater at the adjacent municipal wastewater treatment plants suggested the dilution effect in beach water to below the detection method capability sirikanchana et al 2020 4 2 implications of beach water quality monitoring campaigns the findings from comprehensive microbial monitoring and multivariate analyses could guide the development of localized beach water quality monitoring plans the correlation analysis and odds ratios in this study revealed no associations in terms of frequency or concentrations between fib and the mst markers and pathogens which is in line with reports from other geographical settings powers et al 2020 sauer et al 2011 the high concentrations of fib could have resulted from non point source fecal input including stormwater runoff aging sanitary sewer infrastructure human bathing sand re suspension and animal fecal contributors bradshaw et al 2016 fewtrell and kay 2015 nevers et al 2018 solo gabriele et al 2000 beach bs is more popular among local residents and thai natives while beach pt has facilities accommodation and department stores that are better suited to foreign visitors both beaches have food stalls and beach chairs along their beachfronts and pigeons waterfowls and stray dogs have been observed combined sewer overflows receiving both wastewater and stormwater runoff are located next to the beaches moreover different hydrological patterns at each beach as affected by tides and beach geology could play important roles in dissipating pollution from land to sea or transporting pollution from ships to the shorelines jang et al 2020 price et al 2021 consequently the use of fib could be inappropriate to indicate fecal pollution and to guide policy and management plans aimed at reducing the health risks to beach visitors this study demonstrated that the human specific mst marker hpyvs was the most suitable marker for indicating human fecal pollution at the two studied beaches although no regulatory standard values for mst markers are available mst marker concentrations could be transformed into quantified risks based on a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra framework boehm et al 2018 the results of this study highlight the need for the inclusion of pathogenic vibrio spp in the monitoring campaigns at these two beaches and this could further inform potential public health risks in accordance with the qmra calculation from genetic material data dickinson et al 2013 in the future other pathogens of local concern should also be monitored and the relationships between the pathogens and mst markers should be further evaluated to provide a better understanding of pollution sources and public health risks mordecai et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the use of the qpcr technique in routine monitoring is being increasingly acknowledged as able to provide prompt results regarding health risks associated with pollution and the appropriate facilities sampling and laboratory systems staffing and budgets are needed to support its wide application shrestha and dorevitch 2020 laboratories at regional academic institutions in proximity of 1 d sample transportation could be options for setting up a pilot campaign for routine water quality monitoring promisingly modeling approaches can be used to predict real time microbial parameters from related data and measurements francy et al 2020 searcy and boehm 2021 furthermore the genbac3 pcr could be used as a prescreening tool for general fecal pollution monitoring prior to the use of genbac3 qpcr given the 100 confidence of positive genbac3 pcr results however subsequent qpcr confirmation would be required due to the low confidence in negative genbac3 pcr results this study tested only two endpoint pcr markers genbac3 and crassphage the availability of these developed and validated assays was due to their effective prescreening for general and human specific fecal pollution in freshwater environments somnark et al 2018b however the development and validation of endpoint pcr hpyvs v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus are also needed to offer a prescreening method in marine settings with low costs and a lower requirement for technical skills and instruments the current official beach water quality monitoring program in thailand is conducted by the governmental agency to assess the microbial indicators i e total coliforms fecal coliforms and enterococci at all 211 stations twice a year covering both dry and wet seasons pcd 2019 the results of this monitoring program indicate the state of water quality for the purpose of environmental conservation due to the less pronounced spatial distribution of microbial parameters a sentinel site at each beach could be selected we recommend the current pcd monitoring sites at station b for beach bs and either station d or f for beach pt pcd 2019 more frequent monitoring is essential to assess public health risks particularly for tourists visiting the beaches this study showed the temporal variability in physicochemical and microbial parameters so efforts should be made to sample the water more frequently particularly during the rainy season as we found higher concentrations of hpyvs v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus during this period the european union 2006 requires bathing water to be monitored more frequently than once a month during the bathing season while the us epa 2012 recommends weekly sampling or more tropical beaches on the other hand are visited by tourists throughout the year and the monitoring plan should therefore be well managed to balance the costs and budgets while simultaneously protecting the public from health risks during recreational exposure with the changing climate which will induce higher frequency and intensity precipitation the effects of rainfall especially on non point sources are expected to increase wang et al 2020 in this study the microbial parameters were positively correlated with the 1 and 5 d cumulative rainfall at beach bs but no significant relationship was found at beach pt possibly due to lighter rainfall or stormwater so there was not a significant pollution source at this beach different study sites may be affected by varying accumulated rainfall periods due to the differences in point and non point sources runoff patterns beach geology hydrological patterns and other factors an association between microbial parameters and rainfall records with a range of 12 h 4 d cumulative rainfall prior to sampling has been shown brooks et al 2020 gonzález fernández et al 2021 jennings et al 2018 shrestha et al 2020 wu et al 2021 the localized effects of rainfall should therefore be investigated so that these results can be used to guide recommendations aimed at limiting health risks for example by advising people to avoid recreational activities at marine beaches for certain periods after rainfall events findings from this study underscore the necessity to investigate spatial and temporal distributions of as well as relationship among source tracking indicators and pathogens of concerns in addition to fib indicators for guiding microbial water quality monitoring management plans in tropical marine beaches 5 conclusions nineteen quantitative and two qualitative parameters were analyzed at seven stations for six sampling events n 42 at two recreational marine beaches in thailand the majority 72 2 95 8 of the total coliforms and fecal coliforms but a relatively lower portion 37 5 38 9 of enterococci passed the microbial marine water quality standards at each beach however the fib exceedance rates and concentrations did not correlate with the intensity or the increased odds of detection rates of human specific mst markers and pathogens fecal contamination was omnipresent at both beaches as shown by the genbac3 qpcr marker human sewage was deemed the main pollution source as identified by the human specific marker hpyvs which was more prevalent and concentrated than the human specific marker crassphage however crassphage had a moderate correlation with genbac3 and stronger correlation to fib at beach bs consequently further analysis is required and more sites need to be sampled the human specific culturable aim06 and sr14 phages and general fecal indicator coliphages were not suitable as proxies for beach water quality monitoring due to their low detection rates and concentrations the applicability of the genbac3 endpoint pcr assay as a lower cost prescreening step prior to the genbac3 qpcr assay was supported by its 100 positive predictive value however the negative endpoint pcr results indicated the need for further qpcr confirmation human pathogens were measured and neither human adenovirus types 40 41 or v cholerae were detected in any of the samples v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus correlated with hpyvs and monitoring is thus recommended temporal differences but no spatial differences were observed which suggests a sentinel site is required for water quality monitoring as well as a higher sampling frequency especially during the rainy season as higher concentrations of hpyvs v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus were observed during the wet periods in this study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

16687,developing strategies to identify the origins of contaminants in watersheds is crucial for source water protection the use of multiple tracers improves the ability to identify contamination events originating from various land use activities the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of acesulfame and chloride as co tracers to represent the impact of pollution originating from wastewater and road de icing on water quality in a municipal drinking water source the study included a two year sampling and water quality analysis program in numerous locations within a drinking water reservoir comprising a lake upstream and a river downstream which supply raw water to a municipal water treatment plant results showed that the spatial variability of acesulfame and chloride within the watershed of the lake river systems depends on the location of contaminant sources mainly municipal wastewater and septic tank discharges for acesulfame and the presence of small tributaries of the lake and river for chloride temporal variability of the tracers under study differed according to the sampling location and was mainly affected by seasonal conditions correlation analyses between the two tracers in lake and river waters in terms of concentrations and loads made it possible to pinpoint the probable origins of contamination the assessment of the spatio temporal variability of these co tracers within the lake river watersheds allowed for the delineation of priority intervention zones as a decision making tool for municipal authorities in improving drinking water source protection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords source water protection lake river contaminants tracers acefulfame chloride 1 introduction the impact of wastewater in semi urban environments is an emerging area of research particularly in large cities for which the receiving water body is the principal source water this issue has prompted investigations into chemical tracers and wastewater indicators buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2009 gasser et al 2010 oppenheimer et al 2011 van stempvoort et al 2011 wolf et al 2012 van stempvoort et al 2013 nitka et al 2019 van stempvoort et al 2020 involving the identification of one or more chemical tracers that could be used to determine the extent of water reservoir contamination this contamination may originate from wastewater or other sources either directly or through impacted groundwater previous research has defined the characteristics of ideal tracers in receiving waters gasser et al 2010 dickenson et al 2011 oppenheimer et al 2011 scheurer et al 2011 van stempvoort et al 2013 van stempvoort et al 2020 an ideal tracer is present in waters at concentrations that are well above the analytical detection limit and must be as conservative as possible with respect to its travel in groundwater and surface water ideal tracers are typically artificial or natural compounds that are used for specific anthropogenic activities tracers must also be easy to analyze with high accuracy and precision although numerous tracers nutrients caffeine pharmaceuticals artificial sweeteners have been proposed nakada et al 2008 van stempvoort et al 2013 hardwood 2014 tran et al 2014 richards et al 2017 many pharmaceuticals and other chemicals are known to sorb to solid materials or biodegrade in aquatic environments possibly making them less reliable for use as tracers artificial sweeteners have recently been used as wastewater tracers in particular acesulfame ace has several properties that make it useful as a conservative wastewater tracer in groundwater buerge et al 2009 van stempvoort et al 2013 nitka et al 2019 van stempvoort et al 2020 ace has a low aptitude for adsorbing to solids both in underground and surface water transit and has low biodegradability in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions spoelstra et al 2013 tran et al 2014 spoelstra et al 2020 despite some evidence that ace can be degraded by solar photolysis gan et al 2014 and by advanced wastewater treatment processes castronovo et al 2017 studies have found that the residual concentrations following its partial degradation from treatment remained sufficient for tracing purposes the use of multiple tracers increases the capability of identifying contaminations events in a given place as proposed by mccance et al 2018 the use of sweeteners as co tracers in conjunction with more conventional tracers such as nutrients or major ions can provide more information on the various sources of contamination the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of ace and chloride as co tracers to represent the local impact of anthropogenic activities on the water quality in a municipal drinking water source to the best of our knowledge no other studies have simultaneously examined the use of these two compounds as complementary tracers to track contamination in a drinking water source the study was conducted in the main water reservoir for quebec city canada this source watershed is mainly impacted by domestic sewage from both wastewater treatment plants wwtps and autonomous septic installations https espace inrs ca id eprint 10072 as well as by the heavy use of de icing salt for roads and streets for about five months of the year https agiro org publications diagnose du lac saint charles 2016 in this study ace is used as a tracer for wastewater contamination while chloride is used as the tracer for de icing activities the study included a two year sampling and analysis program in numerous locations of the watershed 2 methodology 2 1 study site and sampling stations lake st charles 46 55 n 71 22 w is the main drinking water reservoir for quebec city canada the lake is fed by two main water sources delage lake and hurons river as well as 34 small brooks narancic et al 2020 both delage lake and the hurons river receive effluents from aerated lagoon wwtps in addition some 2 900 septic installations that serve about 11 000 people are located in the watershed of lake st charles pulicharla et al 2021 the lake which consists of north and south sections fig 1 flows out into st charles river via a dam that was rebuilt in 2012 in order to increase its water storage capacity a water discharge measurement system is available at the dam the mean discharge 2 35 m3 s of st charles lake represents 42 of the total flow of the river at the drinking water treatment plant dwtp intake downstream from the lake the st charles river receives input from the jaune and nelson rivers these rivers respectively contribute to approximately 23 and 35 of the available water for the dwtp located 11 km downstream of the lake fig 2 the watershed that feeds into the dwtp covers an area of 348 km2 while the lake saint charles watershed covers 198 km2 lake saint charles is a meso eutrophic lake and is heavily impacted by the housing surrounding it about 1400 households served by the two wwtps located in the north of the watershed and the 2 900 households served by septic installations located around the lake itself and near the various lake and river tributaries some sectors of its watershed are connected to the quebec city sewer system while other sectors are impacted by septic installations as well as road salts for de icing and in some areas as dust suppressants the delage lake watershed fig 2 carries mainly wastewater from septic installations and from its wwtp into the lake the hurons river watershed is heavily impacted by road salts that are applied because of housing densification and especially the construction of a highway which opened in 2013 and contributes an additional 1000 tons of road salts annually a two year sampling program was conducted during periods with no ice cover on the lake and the river from early may to mid november during the first year 2018 sampling stations were limited to lake st charles and the points of discharge for the two main northern tributaries delage hurons fig 1 these stations accounted for seven of the sampled sites and were sampled 13 times every two weeks sampling during the second year 2019 focused on the various sub watersheds that feed into lake st charles and st charles river up to the point of intake for the dwtp fig 2 the sampling strategy was designed based on accessibility to the sampling stations which was sometimes difficult due to the heavily forested area the 2019 sampling program considered 39 stations including three public wells which were sampled 11 times every two weeks fig 2 in total the two year sampling program resulted in 520 samples for the measurement of ace and chloride ion 2 2 sample collection and laboratory analyses water samples 250 ml were collected in pre

first year of the study we focused our efforts on lake st charles ace was detected in all surface water samples with concentrations ranging from 39 to 277 ng l and a median concentration of 74 ng l table 1 the two rivers that discharge into the northern section of the lake fig 1 exhibited greater variability in ace concentrations than the lake itself this is due to the variable efficiencies of the two wwtps aerated lagoons located near the lake just upstream of the sampling stations ace concentrations within the lake showed similar variations according to the season regardless of sampling location table 2 a total of four sampling stations were categorized into two pairs in order to evaluate the influence of housing developments one station from each pair was located on the east side and one on the west side of lake saint charles one pair was located in the northern part of the lake and the other was in the southern part of the lake fig 1 a small gradient was identified between the west and east sides of the lake in which ace concentrations in the west side were around 8 higher than those in the east side table 1 although chloride concentrations did not present the same slight east west gradient that was observed in ace chloride also varied according to the periods of the year with lower concentrations in early spring and late autumn and higher concentrations in summer as shown in table 2 and fig 3 this seasonal variation is bell shaped this could be reflective of both the effect of summer temperatures potentially linked to an increase in human consumption of beverages and food containing ace and reduced dilution due to decreased precipitation in the summer compared to cooler temperatures and more dilution from spring flooding associated with snowmelt and heavy rain in late fall however the bell shape is less accentuated for chloride than for ace 3 1 2 correlation between ace and chloride concentrations a crucial finding in our study is the high correlation between ace and chloride table 1 observed among the sampling stations within lake st charles ace and chloride have very different origins ace is exclusively associated with human wastewaters wwtps and septic systems while chloride has three possible sources mainly de icing salt with small contributions from soil and rock dissolution and human wastewaters there is no dust abatement in the watershed performing a correlation is necessary to determine the respective impacts of ace and chloride on water quality and ultimately to identify solutions for source water protection against pollutants that are associated with de icing practices and wastewaters from humans ace and chloride concentrations that were measured at the sampling station located at the exit of the lake station e04 in fig 1 were analyzed together with the river flowrate measurement data analysis of table 2 data shows that ace and chloride concentrations do not follow the water discharge pattern r2 0 23 and 0 26 respectively the heavy rains in fall september 27th and october 10th did not noticeably dilute their concentrations in fact ace and chloride continued to follow their bell shaped pattern fig 3 and were mainly influenced by air temperature r2 0 82 and 0 71 respectively based on these correlations the bell shaped curve was mostly determined by temperature and less by dilution than we might previously thought as shown in fig 4 their strong correlation r2 0 92 is maintained even during episodes of heavy rain however the robust correlation observed at the discharge of the lake should not simply be extrapolated to any sampling point anywhere in the watershed this strong relationship is observable only when the following two situations occur simultaneously 1 a substantial population discharges into wastewaters and 2 a significant number of kilometers of roads and streets that require heavy de icing activities is present if only one of these two situations occurs the correlation between ace and chloride will not be observed 3 1 3 correlation between ace and chloride loads estimations of the amount of ace and chloride evacuated at the outlet of lake st charles show that not only are the concentrations correlated but more surprisingly the quantities loads are also correlated even during the episodes of heavy rain at the end of september and beginning of october fig 5 the watershed in our study is characterized by the presence of a large number of households that use septic systems for wastewater treatment consequently ace in septic system effluents may enter the groundwater and flow either directly into the lake or via small brooks and rivers de icing salt is used on roads and streets from late fall to early spring because the soil is covered in snow during this time a fraction of the salt reaches the lake via surface runoff but the majority infiltrates into groundwater as observed by bolduc deraspe et al 2018 in a recent study narancic et al 2020 reported that the largest seasonal contribution to all water sources was groundwater which ranged from 17 in spring to 53 in summer considering that both ace and chloride are conservative chemicals that exhibit a very high correlation at the outlet of the lake it is reasonable to believe that these compounds travel to the lake outlet through groundwater pathways soil and rock sources for chloride represent less than 2 mg l or approximately 10 of the median total of 17 mg l at the lake discharge further discussed in section 3 2 with about 11 000 people living in the lake watershed and a human excretion rate of between 2 and 5 g person per day https www passeportsante net medicaments nom fiche chlorure de sodium 9778 aspx the amount of chloride from human activity represents between 22 and 55 kg per day considering the mean water flowrate of 2 35 m3 s from may to november table 2 the excretion of chloride by humans is in fact very low 0 1 to 0 3 mg l the contribution of de icing activities however represents approximately 88 of total chloride discharge mean of 3450 kg day between may and november a period during which no salt de icing occurs the results from the first year of our field campaign made it possible to demonstrate that ace and chloride levels in lake st charles are impacted by residents through under performing wwtps and septic systems and the excessive use of salt applied to streets and roads in the watershed in order to better pinpoint the regions that are more affected by these two sources of contamination in the second year of our study ace and chloride were exhaustively monitored throughout the entire watershed that supplies the dwtp intake 3 2 watershed tributaries year 2 3 2 1 spatial distribution of ace and chloride as co tracers during the second year of our study 2019 the occurrence of ace and chloride was evaluated in the various sub watersheds that supply lake st charles and st charles river upstream of the dwtp intake fig 2 concentration ranges that were measured at these stations are summarized in table 3 in the large watersheds hurons jaune and nelson rivers ace and chloride concentrations generally increased from upstream to downstream and exhibited similar variations however there were some local exceptions when islands of housing developments and consequently roads and streets being de iced are located inside otherwise undeveloped forested areas it should be noted that in the small brooks that directly connect to the lake stations dd m l s qq kk in fig 2 ace concentrations were frequently high while chloride concentrations remained generally lower than in the lake water this difference could be due to a quebec city municipal program that aims to reduce the amount of de icing that occurs on the streets around lake st charles 3 2 2 prioritization of watershed zones impacted by ace and chloride as shown in table 3 between sampling stations the variability of ace and chloride was high some locations had relatively high levels of both others had relatively low levels of both and others still contained high levels of one and low levels of the other the measured tracer concentrations at all locations were used to delineate and identify sectors within the various sub watersheds where interventions to reduce wastewater and de icing pollutants could be prioritized to conduct this analysis criteria were established to identify locations with relatively low or high pollution levels decision making thresholds based on the average concentrations that were observed at the dwtp intake fig 2 and st charles riv dwtp in table 3 we established the decision making thresholds at 66 ng l for ace and 24 mg l for chloride to meet the ultimate goal of reducing pollution mainly at this location these thresholds represent the median values of ace and chloride concentrations at st charles riv dwtp location indicated in bold on table 3 during the sampling period following these criteria the 39 sampling stations that represent sectors of the sub watersheds were classified into four categories categories 1 4 in table 4 this made it possible to delineate the geographical zones within the sub watersheds that are most affected by the contamination sources associated with both tracers fig 6 ultimately this information could aid decision making for the implementation of pollution prevention measures to protect water quality in the watershed and particularly at the dwtp intake for the sub watershed sectors in category 1 future routine control programs and procedures that evaluate possible changes in water quality would be sufficient category 2 sectors should reduce the amount of de icing salt used for example by locally establishing white roads in which some snow is left on the roads or a small amount of garnet is spread as a replacement for salt for sectors in categories 3 and 4 interventions should focus on improving the performance of the two municipal wwtps and assessing the performance of the septic tanks that service the residences followed by the implementation of programs to improve their contaminant removal efficiency the specific case of the jaune river sub watershed categories 3 and 4 is particularly challenging in this sector connecting the septic systems to a municipal sewer system to ensure adequate treatment in a wwtp should be seriously considered it should be noted that ace which is difficult to remove through wastewater treatment is not necessarily the target but rather other contaminants that are associated with ace 4 conclusions two conservative contaminants acesulfame and chloride were selected and monitored in a surface drinking water source lake main river and tributaries the results indicate that these two chemicals can be used as co tracers to represent the two main pollutants generated by human activity in this region inadequate treatment of domestic wastewaters and the extensive use of de icing salt for roads and streets in winter ace and chloride are not incorporated into ecological processes and are not efficiently eliminated during conventional wastewater treatments such as aerated lagoons or septic tanks moreover ace should be considered an indicator of the numerous other problems that result from poorly treated domestic sewage overconsumption of

16687,developing strategies to identify the origins of contaminants in watersheds is crucial for source water protection the use of multiple tracers improves the ability to identify contamination events originating from various land use activities the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of acesulfame and chloride as co tracers to represent the impact of pollution originating from wastewater and road de icing on water quality in a municipal drinking water source the study included a two year sampling and water quality analysis program in numerous locations within a drinking water reservoir comprising a lake upstream and a river downstream which supply raw water to a municipal water treatment plant results showed that the spatial variability of acesulfame and chloride within the watershed of the lake river systems depends on the location of contaminant sources mainly municipal wastewater and septic tank discharges for acesulfame and the presence of small tributaries of the lake and river for chloride temporal variability of the tracers under study differed according to the sampling location and was mainly affected by seasonal conditions correlation analyses between the two tracers in lake and river waters in terms of concentrations and loads made it possible to pinpoint the probable origins of contamination the assessment of the spatio temporal variability of these co tracers within the lake river watersheds allowed for the delineation of priority intervention zones as a decision making tool for municipal authorities in improving drinking water source protection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords source water protection lake river contaminants tracers acefulfame chloride 1 introduction the impact of wastewater in semi urban environments is an emerging area of research particularly in large cities for which the receiving water body is the principal source water this issue has prompted investigations into chemical tracers and wastewater indicators buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2009 gasser et al 2010 oppenheimer et al 2011 van stempvoort et al 2011 wolf et al 2012 van stempvoort et al 2013 nitka et al 2019 van stempvoort et al 2020 involving the identification of one or more chemical tracers that could be used to determine the extent of water reservoir contamination this contamination may originate from wastewater or other sources either directly or through impacted groundwater previous research has defined the characteristics of ideal tracers in receiving waters gasser et al 2010 dickenson et al 2011 oppenheimer et al 2011 scheurer et al 2011 van stempvoort et al 2013 van stempvoort et al 2020 an ideal tracer is present in waters at concentrations that are well above the analytical detection limit and must be as conservative as possible with respect to its travel in groundwater and surface water ideal tracers are typically artificial or natural compounds that are used for specific anthropogenic activities tracers must also be easy to analyze with high accuracy and precision although numerous tracers nutrients caffeine pharmaceuticals artificial sweeteners have been proposed nakada et al 2008 van stempvoort et al 2013 hardwood 2014 tran et al 2014 richards et al 2017 many pharmaceuticals and other chemicals are known to sorb to solid materials or biodegrade in aquatic environments possibly making them less reliable for use as tracers artificial sweeteners have recently been used as wastewater tracers in particular acesulfame ace has several properties that make it useful as a conservative wastewater tracer in groundwater buerge et al 2009 van stempvoort et al 2013 nitka et al 2019 van stempvoort et al 2020 ace has a low aptitude for adsorbing to solids both in underground and surface water transit and has low biodegradability in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions spoelstra et al 2013 tran et al 2014 spoelstra et al 2020 despite some evidence that ace can be degraded by solar photolysis gan et al 2014 and by advanced wastewater treatment processes castronovo et al 2017 studies have found that the residual concentrations following its partial degradation from treatment remained sufficient for tracing purposes the use of multiple tracers increases the capability of identifying contaminations events in a given place as proposed by mccance et al 2018 the use of sweeteners as co tracers in conjunction with more conventional tracers such as nutrients or major ions can provide more information on the various sources of contamination the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of ace and chloride as co tracers to represent the local impact of anthropogenic activities on the water quality in a municipal drinking water source to the best of our knowledge no other studies have simultaneously examined the use of these two compounds as complementary tracers to track contamination in a drinking water source the study was conducted in the main water reservoir for quebec city canada this source watershed is mainly impacted by domestic sewage from both wastewater treatment plants wwtps and autonomous septic installations https espace inrs ca id eprint 10072 as well as by the heavy use of de icing salt for roads and streets for about five months of the year https agiro org publications diagnose du lac saint charles 2016 in this study ace is used as a tracer for wastewater contamination while chloride is used as the tracer for de icing activities the study included a two year sampling and analysis program in numerous locations of the watershed 2 methodology 2 1 study site and sampling stations lake st charles 46 55 n 71 22 w is the main drinking water reservoir for quebec city canada the lake is fed by two main water sources delage lake and hurons river as well as 34 small brooks narancic et al 2020 both delage lake and the hurons river receive effluents from aerated lagoon wwtps in addition some 2 900 septic installations that serve about 11 000 people are located in the watershed of lake st charles pulicharla et al 2021 the lake which consists of north and south sections fig 1 flows out into st charles river via a dam that was rebuilt in 2012 in order to increase its water storage capacity a water discharge measurement system is available at the dam the mean discharge 2 35 m3 s of st charles lake represents 42 of the total flow of the river at the drinking water treatment plant dwtp intake downstream from the lake the st charles river receives input from the jaune and nelson rivers these rivers respectively contribute to approximately 23 and 35 of the available water for the dwtp located 11 km downstream of the lake fig 2 the watershed that feeds into the dwtp covers an area of 348 km2 while the lake saint charles watershed covers 198 km2 lake saint charles is a meso eutrophic lake and is heavily impacted by the housing surrounding it about 1400 households served by the two wwtps located in the north of the watershed and the 2 900 households served by septic installations located around the lake itself and near the various lake and river tributaries some sectors of its watershed are connected to the quebec city sewer system while other sectors are impacted by septic installations as well as road salts for de icing and in some areas as dust suppressants the delage lake watershed fig 2 carries mainly wastewater from septic installations and from its wwtp into the lake the hurons river watershed is heavily impacted by road salts that are applied because of housing densification and especially the construction of a highway which opened in 2013 and contributes an additional 1000 tons of road salts annually a two year sampling program was conducted during periods with no ice cover on the lake and the river from early may to mid november during the first year 2018 sampling stations were limited to lake st charles and the points of discharge for the two main northern tributaries delage hurons fig 1 these stations accounted for seven of the sampled sites and were sampled 13 times every two weeks sampling during the second year 2019 focused on the various sub watersheds that feed into lake st charles and st charles river up to the point of intake for the dwtp fig 2 the sampling strategy was designed based on accessibility to the sampling stations which was sometimes difficult due to the heavily forested area the 2019 sampling program considered 39 stations including three public wells which were sampled 11 times every two weeks fig 2 in total the two year sampling program resulted in 520 samples for the measurement of ace and chloride ion 2 2 sample collection and laboratory analyses water samples 250 ml were collected in pre

table 1 the two rivers that discharge into the northern section of the lake fig 1 exhibited greater variability in ace concentrations than the lake itself this is due to the variable efficiencies of the two wwtps aerated lagoons located near the lake just upstream of the sampling stations ace concentrations within the lake showed similar variations according to the season regardless of sampling

yicc and atp yield yatp were determined for conventionally treated drinking water tap water and remineralised ro permeate ro water in addition both bgpicc and bgpatp methods were used to identify the

both bgpicc and bgpatp methods revealed that carbon was the growth limiting nutrient in the two types of water however with the addition of extra carbon phosphate limitation was detected only with the bgpicc method whereas bgpatp was not affected suggesting that a combination of carbon and phosphate is essential for biomass synthesis whereas carbon is probably utilised for cellular activities other

viability abushaban et al 2019 bgp assessment by fcm or atp overcomes the limitations of the traditional biological stability assessment methods that are based on plate counting in terms of rapidity accuracy and laborious demands hammes et al 2010 prest et al 2016b van nevel et al 2017 however there are no guidelines based on fcm or atp as these parameters are still used for research purposes moreover fcm and atp measurements are beneficial for the complete detection of bacterial cells in water allowing for using a natural bacterial inoculum for bgp tests to ensure the consumption of a wider range of organic compounds present in the water hammes and egli 2005 several studies have used both fcm and atp in field testing for monitoring water quality in treatment plants and distribution systems vital et al 2012 farhat et al 2018 where the relationship between instant fcm and atp measurements has been investigated by measuring bgp of different water types farhat et al 2018 found that atp and fcm results did not show the same trend due to the nature of each method where atp measures variable energy carrier compounds within cells while fcm measures the numerical growth of bacteria based on these observations the authors suggested combining both methods for more insights into bacterial growth potential however the reason behind the different bgp trends with fcm and atp and the interpretation of this difference still need further investigation for conventional drinking water and more especially for ultra low nutrient drinking water such as remineralised reverse osmosis ro permeate the latter water type is the focus of this study where a very low bgp has been reported for drinking water produced by ro based treatment sousi et al 2018 therefore the objective of this study was to combine the outcome of bgp obtained by fcm intact cell count bgpicc with that by atp bgpatp two water types were used to conduct this comparison namely conventionally treated drinking water with a relatively high nutrient content versus ultra low nutrient water produced by ro based treatment ro and remineralisation the comparison included the ratio between the bgpicc and bgpatp of these types of water as well as the ratio between intact cell yield yicc and atp yield yatp obtained for each water type moreover nutrient limitation was investigated in each water type with both bgpicc and bgpatp 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples this study was conducted at the oasen drinking water treatment plant located in kamerik the netherlands which supplies 340 m3 h of drinking water the detailed description of treatment and water quality is given in sousi et al 2020a in short the plant currently treats anaerobic groundwater by conventional means comprising dry sand filtration rapid sand filters fed with spray aerated water pellet softening rapid sand filtration activated carbon filtration and uv disinfection the finished conventionally treated drinking water tap water is stored in the clean water reservoir from which samples were collected during this study a pilot scale advanced treatment scheme 7 m3 h is installed at the same location to treat anaerobic groundwater directly by reverse osmosis ro with a total recovery of 75 thereafter ro permeate is post treated with ion exchange remineralisation by calcite contactors magnesium doing and tower aeration additional details about the conventional and ro based water treatment schemes can be found in the supplementary information table s1 the blank was prepared by correcting the mineral content of water collected directly after ro filtration i e ro permeate at the laboratory using ultrapure chemical stock solutions where the final concentrations were as follows nahco3 ph of 7 8 0 2 122 mg l hco3 cacl2 40 mg l ca2 and mgcl2 4 mg l mg2 the blank laboratory remineralised ro permeate is denoted as ro water the water quality analysis of tap water and ro water including lc ocd analysis and aoc determined according to van der kooij et al 1982 is shown in the supplementary information table s2 the cell count in ro permeate 2 103 total cells ml and 103 intact cells ml was lower than that reported in other studies dixon et al 2012 thayanukul et al 2013 buysschaert et al 2018 fujioka et al 2018 which might be attributed to the anaerobic operation of ro in this study that resulted in limited bacterial growth on ro membranes or different methods used for cell counting 2 2 bacterial growth potential bgp test the bacterial growth potential bgp of water was measured according to sousi et al 2018 in short samples of tap water and ro water were collected in aoc free glassware that is treated at 550 c for 6 h thereafter samples were pre treated at the laboratory by pasteurisation 70 c for 30 min to inactivate indigenous bacteria before inoculating with 104 icc ml icc intact cell count of a natural bacteria consortium originating from tap water where using ro permeate bacteria as an inoculum is not recommended due to their limited ability to consume complex organic carbon sousi et al 2020b pre treated samples were distributed between three individual aoc free vials i e triplicate measurements per sample incubated in the dark at 30 c and lastly measured for intact cell count icc or atp over a growth period of 20 days bgp was expressed as the maximum intact cell count or atp concentration obtained during the incubation period bgp based on intact cell count by fcm is denoted as bgpicc whereas bgp based on atp is denoted as bgpatp moreover a broth of trace elements was used for growth limitation experiments where two stock solutions were prepared ph 7 stock solution a containing 5 mg l cocl2 6h2o and 10 mg l h3bo3 and stock solution b containing 500 mg l mnso4 7h2o 10 mg l znso4 7h2o and 300 mg l feso4 7h2o the stock solutions were kept in the dark at room temperature aliquots of 4 and 3 7 ml l from stock solutions a and b respectively were added in water samples resulting in final concentrations of 5 µg l co 6 5 µg l b 359 µg l mn 8 5 µg l zn 215 µg l fe and 345 µg l s moreover adding phosphate and nitrogen was accompanied with the addition of 29 2 µg l k as elaborated in the following sections 2 3 intact cell count icc icc was measured using flow cytometry bd accuri c6 fcm bd biosciences belgium coupled with dna staining a mix of sybr green i and propidium iodide stains as previously described by prest et al 2016a the detection limit is 103 icc ml moreover data obtained by fcm namely the ratio of high and low nucleic acid bacteria hna and lna as well as forward and sideward scatter signals fsc and ssc were analysed for both water types as described by wang et al 2009 2 4 adenosine triphosphate atp intracellular atp from microorganisms was measured according to the filtration based method described by abushaban et al 2019 using a water glo testing kit lysis reagent and detection reagent and a glomax 20 20 luminometer promega corp usa the detection limit is 0 1 ng atp l an atp calibration line was prepared for each water type tap water and ro water to convert the measured emitted light relative light units rlu into intracellular atp concentration as shown in the supplementary information fig s1 2 5 experimental approach experiments were conducted with two types of water conventionally treated water tap water and ultra low nutrient drinking water prepared by remineralising ro permeate ro water samples of tap water and ro water were pasteurised and inoculated with bacteria originating from tap water as described in the previous section thereafter six different nutrient combinations carbon phosphate and nitrogen were added to these samples prior to bgp measurement as shown in fig 1 where zone a represents the actual bgp of tap water or ro water without the addition of nutrients results presented in fig 2 zone b represents bgp measurement with the addition of c n p up to a ratio of 100 10 1 according to bacterial elemental composition hammes and egli 2005 results presented in fig 5 and zone c represents bgp measurement with the addition of extra carbon considering a c n p ratio of 100 300 10 1 results presented in fig 6 nutrients were added from the following stock solutions 0 219 g l kh2po4 for phosphate addition 3 607 g l kno3 for nitrogen addition and 1 000 50 mg l ac c for carbon acetate addition bacterial yield y is calculated from the slope of the linear increase in icc or atp with the standard carbon addition based on the bgp results the following calculations were made ratio bgpicc bgpicc of tap water bgpicc of ro water ratio bgpatp bgpatp of tap water bgpatp of ro water ratio yicc yicc of tap water yicc of ro water ratio yatp yatp of tap water yatp of ro water in addition to the previous calculations the growth limiting nutrient was determined using bgpicc and bgpatp as described in table s3 fig 1 represents the experimental approach followed in this study 2 6 statistical analysis the significance level of observed differences between samples was examined using student s t test and one way analysis of variance anova test after affirming the data normality q q plots chi squared tests and kolmogorov smirnov tests in addition a simple linear correlation between two quantitative variables was applied calculations for statistical analysis were conducted using the microsoft excel software version 2013 considering 95 confidence interval alpha of 0 05 3 results the ratio of bgpicc and bgpatp between tap water and ro water the bgpicc of tap water and ro water without the addition of any nutrient were 436 20 103 and 58 3 103 icc ml respectively as shown in fig 2a which resulted in a bgpicc ratio of about 7 5 between the two water types the corresponding bgpatp under the same conditions were 20 10 1 40 and 4 32 1 10 ng atp l respectively as shown in fig 2b the ratio of which was about 4 5 the results of bgpicc and bgpatp clearly demonstrated that the ratio of bgp between tap water and ro water was significantly influenced by the parameter used i e icc by fcm vs atp moreover based on the aforementioned observations the atp per cell for tap water 4 6 10 17 g atp cell was considerably lower than that of ro water 7 4 10 17 g atp cell 3 1 the intact cell yield yicc and atp yield yatp based on the growth curves of tap water vs ro water the bgpicc and bgpatp were determined for each carbon concentration 0 300 µg l ac c based on the 14 days growth curves of icc fig 3 and atp fig 4 the atp concentration after pasteurisation on the first test day was 0 1 ng l in both water types however the corresponding icc in ro treated water was 103 icc ml whereas tap water contained around 100 103 icc ml of pasteurisation resistant cells which could not grow during the growth test period sousi et al 2020b for ro water it was observed that the growth peak was quicker obtained with atp than icc 3 days vs 4 7 days for all carbon concentrations similar phenomenon was observed for tap water when 5 µg l ac c was added where a second atp peak was also observed after 7 10 days however for tap water with low carbon concentrations 0 5 µg l ac c both atp and icc peaks were obtained after 7 10 days in addition figs 3 and 4 clearly demonstrate that atp concentration significantly dropped after reaching the peak especially with the addition of high carbon concentrations irrespective of the type of water on the contrary icc was maintained around the peak value until day 14 when considering low carbon concentrations 0 100 µg l ac c whereas a drop in icc was observed after day 4 6 at carbon concentrations of 200 and 300 µg l ac c the analysis of fcm data showed that 80 of the cells growing in tap water and ro water were hna bacteria however both fsc and ssc signals were higher for ro water than tap water at all carbon concentrations indicating larger bacterial cells in ro water i e an average of 2200 vs 880 for fsc and 2100 vs 1200 for ssc respectively table s4 yicc and yatp for both water types were determined based on the slope of the linear increase in bgpicc and bgpatp with the standard addition of carbon up to 100 µg l ac c fig 5 where carbon was not limiting the growth due to the addition of phosphate 1 µg l po4 p and nitrogen 10 µg l no3 n according to the ratio of c n p 100 10 1 the yicc for ro water was 4 6 0 1 106 cells µg c which was not influenced by the addition of trace elements k co h3bo3 mn zn fe and s fig s2 indicating that these trace elements were not the limiting factor for bacterial growth even in the ultrapure ro treated water for tap water the yicc was 9 8 0 6 106 cells µg c which was 2 times higher than that in the ro water fig 5a conversely the yatp for both water types was similar ratio of 1 which was 0 39 0 12 and 0 42 0 06 ng atp µg c for tap water and ro water respectively fig 5b based on the icc and atp results the maximum atp per cell was calculated for each carbon concentration fig s3 the atp per cell values for ro water were consistently 2 4 times higher than these for tap water where the spike of carbon in ro water resulted in an increase of 50 in atp per cell even at 5 µg l ac c while for tap water the atp per cell values were stable around the same level for the whole carbon range of 0 300 µg l ac c 3 2 growth limiting nutrient identified by bgpicc and bgpatp for tap water vs ro water as shown in fig s4 both bgpicc and bgpatp of tap water without the addition of nutrients were comparable to these of tap water with 1 µg l po4 p and 10 µg l no3 n added fig s5 shows similar observations for ro water therefore both bgpicc and bgpatp revealed that carbon was the growth limiting nutrient in tap water as well as ro water when carbon was added clear differences were observed fig 6 for tap water a linear increase in bgpicc was observed until the addition of 100 µg l ac c when the ratio of added c n p was 100 10 1 fig 6a left afterwards a plateaued curve was established where the difference in bgpicc was insignificant for 100 200 or 300 µg l ac c addition p 0 05 fig 6a right the bgpicc of tap water increased from 454 65 103 icc ml with no carbon addition to the level of 1500 103 icc ml with the addition of 100 200 or 300 µg l ac c indicating that there might be other elements e g phosphate limiting cell multiplication on the contrary such a trend was not observed for bgpatp with the addition of carbon from 0 to 300 µg l ac c the bgpatp of tap water showed a linear increase from 21 41 1 62 ng atp l to 130 32 27 14 ng atp l fig 6b the different trends observed for bgpicc and bgpatp indicate that though the cell number reached a stable level due to the limitation on cell multiplication the cellular activity kept increasing to obtain a holistic view the actual c n p ratio was calculated by including the internally available nutrients in tap water and ro water table s5 the original aoc in tap water was 45 µg l ac c 10 times higher than aoc p17 and nox considering the yicc obtained in fig 5a meaning that the actual c n p ratio was 145 2910 2 with the addition of 100 µg l ac c on the other hand for ro water both bgpicc and bgpatp increased linearly along the whole range of carbon addition from 0 to 300 µg l ac c fig 6a and b indicating that there was no growth or activity limitation observed for ro water remarkably the bgpicc for ro water was approaching but did not reach the cell number limitation observed for tap water 1 327 48 103 vs 1 500 103 icc ml 4 discussion intact cell count icc and atp measurements were used to evaluate the bacterial growth potential of conventionally treated water tap water and ultra low nutrient water prepared by remineralising ro permeate ro water combining the results obtained by intact cell count and atp allowed for integral understanding of the bacterial growth characteristics of each water type in addition trace elements n p and different concentrations of acetate carbon were added for performing a matrix of bgp tests which allowed for the investigation of growth limiting factors and the comparison between icc and atp for measuring bacterial growth dynamics 4 1 reduction in bgpicc and bgpatp achieved by ro based treatment in the present study both bgpicc and bgpatp showed that ro based treatment ro water resulted in a significantly lower bgp than that of conventional treatment tap water fig 2 which is in line with previous findings on ro performance for controlling bacterial growth park and hu 2010 thayanukul et al 2013 sousi et al 2020a this could be explained by the high aoc rejection efficiency of ro membrane escobar et al 2000 hong et al 2005 in addition although the same bacterial consortium was inoculated in both water types the difference in water matrix might have also contributed to the reduction in bgp achieved by ro treatment such as the difference in inorganic and or trace elements for example the conductivity in ro water was 3 times lower than that of tap water 20 9 ms m vs 63 2 ms m table s2 the bgp tests performed on ro water with addition of ca mg hco3 and other essential trace elements i e k co zn fe mn s and hydrogen borate confirmed that none of these elements was the growth limiting factor in the ultra low nutrient ro permeate based on the previous observations it is hypothesised that bacterial in ro treated water might be limited not only by organic compounds but also by certain inorganic constituents that were present in tap water at extremely low concentrations which were not included in this study however the results revealed that the magnitude of bgp reduction was dependent on the parameter used where bgpicc showed a higher reduction ratio 7 5 times compared with bgpatp 4 5 times the different degree of bacterial growth measured by icc and atp was previously reported and attributed to the discrepancy of the two measurements and the possibility of missing the atp peak because of the rapid increase and collapse in atp values when readily available carbon such as acetate is added farhat et al 2018 such discrepancies were observed in the present study where the measurement of bacterial growth with the addition of acetate carbon revealed that the atp peak was obtained after 3 days while the icc reached the peak within 4 7 days figs 3 and 4 moreover farhat et al 2018 argued that both methods are accurate and reliable while the definition of growth in terms of cell multiplication or active biomass formation dictates which method evaluates the growth better and suggested that the combination of bgpicc and bgpatp together with the parameter atp per cell offers more insights into growth potential although the same bacteria originating from conventionally treated water were used as an inoculum in the present study the atp per cell of ro water was consistently higher 2 4 times than that of tap water indicating that there might be different bacteria thrived in the two water types the higher atp per cell in ro water was in line with the fcm data fsc and ssc signals which were higher in ro water compared with tap water affirming the larger cell size in ro water wang et al 2009 sousi et al 2020a it is well known that the level of atp production is influenced by environmental conditions hespell and bryant 1979 boström and törnblom 1990 where atp production would be affected when cells are subjected to conditions that are different from their original environment which could explain the higher atp per cell in ro water compared with tap water moreover the standard carbon addition tests showed that the tap water bacterial consortium inoculated in ro water converted carbon into atp for bioactivities e g synthesis of reserve materials mobility hammes et al 2010 mempin et al 2013 as efficient as in their own water where a comparable yatp was observed in both water types however two atp peaks were observed in tap water corresponding to the added readily available organic carbon first peak and the natural organic compounds present in water second peak van der kooij et al 2017 the second peak was not observed in ro water because of its ultra low nutrient content specifically complex organic compounds as measured by lc ocd table s2 the concentration of atp quickly dropped after the first peak in both water types which could be attributed to the rapid response of atp production to environmental changes i e the addition and consumption of acetate in this case the drop in intracellular atp concentrations could imply increasing extracellular atp during growth mempin et al 2013 ihssen et al 2021 or an actual decrease in intracellular atp due to physiological reasons i e less active cells the quick drop in intracellular atp was not accompanied with a significant decrease in cell numbers indicating that cells were maintaining themselves with low levels of energy and bioactivities bacterial growth in term of intact cell count and thus intact cell yield was significantly affected by the change in the surrounding environment tap water vs ro water where the rate of cell synthesis in ro water was hindered according to this comparison it is suggested that bacteria inoculated in an unfavourable environment ro water tend to covert available nutrients into energy source atp for surviving rather than synthesising new cells although the same inoculum was used there might be different bacteria thrived in tap water and ro water especially considering the significantly different atp per cell between the two water types for future research it is recommended to investigate the dynamics of bacterial communities and identify which members become dominant during bacterial growth in each water type which will be valuable for understanding bacterial growth from community composition and structure level this is especially important considering that each water type contained different bacterial communities sousi et al 2020a 4 2 the role of phosphate in bacterial growth and the maximum intact cell yield per µg po4 p in the present study both bgpatp and bgpicc clearly showed that carbon was the growth limiting nutrient in tap water and ro water however different trends of bacterial growth were observed when 100 µg l ac c was added which could be attributed to the phosphate limitation established in tap water this is because nitrogen limitation could be clearly excluded as a result of the data presented in table s2 i e excess no3 n at 2910 and 260 μg l in tap water and ro water respectively additionally no growth limitation effect was observed for a wide range of trace elements k ca mg mn co zn fe h3bo3 and s fig s2 where even in ro water there were sufficient trace elements for cell multiplication until the addition of 300 µg l ac c fig 6a therefore trace elements limitation was excluded as such the actual c p ratio when changing from carbon limited fig 1 zone b to carbon excess fig 1 zone c conditions in tap water was 145 2 which is between the redfield ratio of 100 1 hammes and egli 2005 and the 50 3 ratio for exponentially growing cells under carbon limited conditions egli 2009 this complies with the consensus of variable microbial cell composition which is highly dependent on the cultivation conditions herbert 1961 the difference regarding the bgpicc and bgpatp trends of tap water with phosphate limitation suggested that phosphate is an essential element necessary for biomass synthesis jansson 1988 miettinen et al 1997 but phosphate limitation did not influence the formation of bacterial atp because carbon was the main nutrient needed by bacteria to produce atp required for bio activities regardless whether new biomass was synthesised or not giorgio and cole 1998 in other words this finding indicates that bgpatp cannot be used to detect phosphate limitation in water or to measure growth potential in term of cell synthesis when phosphate is the growth limiting nutrient interestingly the maximum number of cells obtained in tap water at 100 µg l ac c addition and in ro water at 300 µg l ac c addition was in the same range 1 3 1 5 106 icc ml therefore it is reasonable to hypothesise that this is the maximum intact cell count which could be synthesised out of the total available phosphate i e phosphate already present in water as well as the added 1 µg l po4 p assuming that the already present phosphate in water was around the method detection limit of 1 µg l po4 p reported values were 0 8 0 9 µg l po4 p for both water types intact cell yield growing on phosphate could be estimated in the range of 0 70 0 05 109 cells µg po4 p indicating that significant bacterial growth could be promoted at extremely low phosphate concentrations miettinen et al 1997 to the best of our knowledge this is the very first study discussing the potential intact cell yield quantified by fcm on phosphate in drinking water where there was no data available for comparison the reported yield based on the standard plate count method was about 3 73 105 cfu µg po4 p lehtola et al 1999 which is much lower than that obtained based on fcm this difference might be caused by the fact that only pseudomonas fluorescens p17 was used and less than 1 of bacteria in water could be plate cultivated hammes and egli 2005 van nevel et al 2017 it is worthwhile to mention that a different cell yield based on phosphate can be obtained for other types of water which was observed in this study for cell yield based on carbon i e different cell yield between tap water and ro treated water 4 3 practical insights bgp test bgpicc and bgpatp are increasingly applied for the assessment of biological stability of drinking water in general it is agreed that both methods are rapid accurate and reproducible where bgpicc measures cell synthesis and bgpatp measures cellular activity vital et al 2012 prest et al 2016a van der kooij et al 2017 farhat et al 2018 sousi et al 2020a as reported in this study and elsewhere the combination of bgpicc and bgpatp in addition to the traditional methods for cell measurement such the determination of cell density and bio volume can provide more insights into the bacterial growth e g in depth understanding of cell growth stages and the role of growth limiting nutrients in addition the present study has also demonstrated bgpatp could not reveal the bgp of phosphate limited samples therefore for the choice of bgp method bgpicc would be suitable for all cases while bgpatp should be applied only on the carbon limitation cases since most of drinking water is carbon limited van der kooij et al 1982 huck 1990 schurer et al 2019 sousi et al 2020a both methods are suitable to be used for bacterial growth potential assessment microbially available phosphate map as discussed in this study and elsewhere it is clear that even a very low concentration of phosphate 1 µg l po4 p can promote extensive microbial growth e g 106 icc ml lehtola et al 1999 nescerecka et al 2018 however the traditional method for phosphate measurement with the current detection limit of 1 µg l po4 p can hardly be helpful for bacterial growth evaluation using pseudomonas fluorescens p17 and plate count lehtola et al 1999 was able to develop a sensitive bioassay for determining map in water with a detection limit of 0 08 µg l po4 p the present study demonstrated that by using natural bacterial consortium as an inoculum and applying fcm for intact cell quantification the map bioassay could be significantly improved regarding the representativity and sensitivity i e lower limit of detection such a bioassay will be especially valuable for the ultra low nutrient drinking water where phosphate concentration is below the current detection limit but the bacterial growth in water might be phosphate limited another advantage of such a bioassay is that it can be used to measure all types of phosphate that are of importance for bacterial growth in drinking water 5 conclusions the assessment of bacterial growth potential bgp using both flow cytometric intact cell count icc and adenosine triphosphate atp is especially useful as additional complementary information can be obtained from the combined tests bgpicc and bgpatp comparing conventionally treated drinking water tap water and ultra low nutrient water prepared by remineralising ro permeate ro water using both methods revealed that although the same bacterial inoculum originating from tap water was used the bgpicc ratio between tap water ro water was about 7 5 whereas the bgpatp ratio was about 4 5 regarding the yield of bacteria growing on acetate a comparable atp yield was obtained for tap water and ro water 0 39 0 12 vs 0 42 0 06 ng atp µg c respectively whereas the intact cell yield was significantly different 9 8 0 6 106 vs 4 6 0 8 106 cells µg c a consistently higher atp per cell was observed for ro water compared with tap water which could be attributed to the fact that the inoculum used was adapted to a significantly higher salinity and a broader range of trace elements than these present in remineralised ro permeate this indicates that bacterial growth in ultra low nutrient water could be limited not only by organic compounds but also inorganic constituents carbon was identified as the growth limiting nutrient in the two types of water studied by both bgpicc and bgpatp with the addition of extra carbon phosphate limitation was detected with bgpicc but not bgpatp suggesting that a combination of carbon and phosphate is essential for the synthesis of new cells whereas carbon is probably used as an energy source for other bacterial activities measured by atp when phosphate is limited the intact cell yield growing on phosphate was estimated at 0 70 0 05 109 cells µg po4 p indicating that significant bacterial growth could be promoted when extremely low concentrations of phosphate are available declaration of competing interest none

16688,the bacterial growth potential bgp of drinking water is widely assessed either by flow cytometric intact cell count bgpicc or adenosine triphosphate bgpatp based methods combining bgpicc and bgpatp measurements has been previously applied for various types of drinking water having high to low growth potential however this has not been applied for water with ultra low nutrient content such as remineralised ro permeate to conduct a sound comparison conventionally treated drinking water was included in this study which was also used as an inoculum source bgpicc bgpatp intact cell yield yicc and atp yield yatp were determined for conventionally treated drinking water tap water and remineralised ro permeate ro water in addition both bgpicc and bgpatp methods were used to identify the growth limiting nutrient in each water type the results showed that the bgpicc ratio between tap water ro water was 7 5 whereas the bgpatp ratio was only 4 5 moreover the yicc ratio between tap water ro water was 2 9 8 0 6 106 vs 4 6 0 8 106 cells µg c whereas the yatp ratio was 1 0 39 0 12 vs 0 42 0 06 ng atp µg c resulting in a consistently higher atp per cell in ro water than that of tap water both bgpicc and bgpatp methods revealed that carbon was the growth limiting nutrient in the two types of water however with the addition of extra carbon phosphate limitation was detected only with the bgpicc method whereas bgpatp was not affected suggesting that a combination of carbon and phosphate is essential for biomass synthesis whereas carbon is probably utilised for cellular activities other than cell synthesis when phosphate is limited it was estimated that the intact cell yield growing on phosphate would be 0 70 0 05 109 cells µg po4 p graphical abstract image graphical abstract

atp and fcm results did not show the same trend due to the nature of each method where atp measures variable energy carrier compounds within cells while fcm measures the numerical growth of bacteria based on these observations the authors suggested combining both methods for more insights into bacterial growth potential however the reason behind the different bgp trends with fcm and atp and the interpretation of this difference still need further investigation for conventional drinking water and more especially for ultra low nutrient drinking water such as remineralised reverse osmosis ro permeate the latter water type is the focus of this study where a very low bgp has been reported for drinking water produced by ro based treatment sousi et al 2018 therefore the objective of this study was to combine the outcome of bgp obtained by fcm intact cell count bgpicc with that by atp bgpatp two water types were used to conduct this comparison namely conventionally treated drinking water with a relatively high nutrient content versus ultra low nutrient water produced by ro based treatment ro and remineralisation the comparison included the ratio between the bgpicc and bgpatp of these types of water as well as the ratio between intact cell yield yicc and atp yield yatp obtained for each water type moreover nutrient limitation was investigated in each water type with both bgpicc and bgpatp 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples this study was conducted at the oasen drinking water treatment plant located in kamerik the netherlands which supplies 340 m3 h of drinking water the detailed description of treatment and water quality is given in sousi et al 2020a in short the plant currently treats anaerobic groundwater by conventional means comprising dry sand filtration rapid sand filters fed with spray aerated water pellet softening rapid sand filtration activated carbon filtration and uv disinfection the finished conventionally treated drinking water tap water is stored in the clean water reservoir from which samples were collected during this study a pilot scale advanced treatment scheme 7 m3 h is installed at the same location to treat anaerobic groundwater directly by reverse osmosis ro with a total recovery of 75 thereafter ro permeate is post treated with ion exchange remineralisation by calcite contactors magnesium doing and tower aeration additional details about the conventional and ro based water treatment schemes can be found in the supplementary information table s1 the blank was prepared by correcting the mineral content of water collected directly after ro filtration i e ro permeate at the laboratory using ultrapure chemical stock solutions where the final concentrations were as follows nahco3 ph of 7 8 0 2 122 mg l hco3 cacl2 40 mg l ca2 and mgcl2 4 mg l mg2 the blank laboratory remineralised ro permeate is denoted as ro water the water quality analysis of tap water and ro water including lc ocd analysis and aoc determined according to van der kooij et al 1982 is shown in the supplementary information table s2 the cell count in ro permeate 2 103 total cells ml and 103 intact cells ml was lower than that reported in other studies dixon et al 2012 thayanukul et al 2013 buysschaert et al 2018 fujioka et al 2018 which might be attributed to the anaerobic operation of ro in this study that resulted in limited bacterial growth on ro membranes or different methods used for cell counting 2 2 bacterial growth potential bgp test the bacterial growth potential bgp of water was measured according to sousi et al 2018 in short samples of tap water and ro water were collected in aoc free glassware that is treated at 550 c for 6 h thereafter samples were pre treated at the laboratory by pasteurisation 70 c for 30 min to inactivate indigenous bacteria before inoculating with 104 icc ml icc intact cell count of a natural bacteria consortium originating from tap water where using ro permeate bacteria as an inoculum is not recommended due to their limited ability to consume complex organic carbon sousi et al 2020b pre treated samples were distributed between three individual aoc free vials i e triplicate measurements per sample incubated in the dark at 30 c and lastly measured for intact cell count icc or atp over a growth period of 20 days bgp was expressed as the maximum intact cell count or atp concentration obtained during the incubation period bgp based on intact cell count by fcm is denoted as bgpicc whereas bgp based on atp is denoted as bgpatp moreover a broth of trace elements was used for growth limitation experiments where two stock solutions were prepared ph 7 stock solution a containing 5 mg l cocl2 6h2o and 10 mg l h3bo3 and stock solution b containing 500 mg l mnso4 7h2o 10 mg l znso4 7h2o and 300 mg l feso4 7h2o the stock solutions were kept in the dark at room temperature aliquots of 4 and 3 7 ml l from stock solutions a and b respectively were added in water samples resulting in final concentrations of 5 µg l co 6 5 µg l b 359 µg l mn 8 5 µg l zn 215 µg l fe and 345 µg l s moreover adding phosphate and nitrogen was accompanied with the addition of 29 2 µg l k as elaborated in the following sections 2 3 intact cell count icc icc was measured using flow cytometry bd accuri c6 fcm bd biosciences belgium coupled with dna staining a mix of sybr green i and propidium iodide stains as previously described by prest et al 2016a the detection limit is 103 icc ml moreover data obtained by fcm namely the ratio of high and low nucleic acid bacteria hna and lna as well as forward and sideward scatter signals fsc and ssc were analysed for both water types as described by wang et al 2009 2 4 adenosine triphosphate atp intracellular atp from microorganisms was measured according to the filtration based method described by abushaban et al 2019 using a water glo testing kit lysis reagent and detection reagent and a glomax 20 20 luminometer promega corp usa the detection limit is 0 1 ng atp l an atp calibration line was prepared for each water type tap water and ro water to convert the measured emitted light relative light units rlu into intracellular atp concentration as shown in the supplementary information fig s1 2 5 experimental approach experiments were conducted with two types of water conventionally treated water tap water and ultra low nutrient drinking water prepared by remineralising ro permeate ro water samples of tap water and ro water were pasteurised and inoculated with bacteria originating from tap water as described in the previous section thereafter six different nutrient combinations carbon phosphate and nitrogen were added to these samples prior to bgp measurement as shown in fig 1 where zone a represents the actual bgp of tap water or ro water without the addition of nutrients results presented in fig 2 zone b represents bgp measurement with the addition of c n p up to a ratio of 100 10 1 according to bacterial elemental composition hammes and egli 2005 results presented in fig 5 and zone c represents bgp measurement with the addition of extra carbon considering a c n p ratio of 100 300 10 1 results presented in fig 6 nutrients were added from the following stock solutions 0 219 g l kh2po4 for phosphate addition 3 607 g l kno3 for nitrogen addition and 1 000 50 mg l ac c for carbon acetate addition bacterial yield y is calculated from the slope of the linear increase in icc or atp with the standard carbon addition based on the bgp results the following calculations were made ratio bgpicc bgpicc of tap water bgpicc of ro water ratio bgpatp bgpatp of tap water bgpatp of ro water ratio yicc yicc of tap water yicc of ro water ratio yatp yatp of tap water yatp of ro water in addition to the previous calculations the growth limiting nutrient was determined using bgpicc and bgpatp as described in table s3 fig 1 represents the experimental approach followed in this study 2 6 statistical analysis the significance level of observed differences between samples was examined using student s t test and one way analysis of variance anova test after affirming the data normality q q plots chi squared tests and kolmogorov smirnov tests in addition a simple linear correlation between two quantitative variables was applied calculations for statistical analysis were conducted using the microsoft excel software version 2013 considering 95 confidence interval alpha of 0 05 3 results the ratio of bgpicc and bgpatp between tap water and ro water the bgpicc of tap water and ro water without the addition of any nutrient were 436 20 103 and 58 3 103 icc ml respectively as shown in fig 2a which resulted in a bgpicc ratio of about 7 5 between the two water types the corresponding bgpatp under the same conditions were 20 10 1 40 and 4 32 1 10 ng atp l respectively as shown in fig 2b the ratio of which was about 4 5 the results of bgpicc and bgpatp clearly demonstrated that the ratio of bgp between tap water and ro water was significantly influenced by the parameter used i e icc by fcm vs atp moreover based on the aforementioned observations the atp per cell for tap water 4 6 10 17 g atp cell was considerably lower than that of ro water 7 4 10 17 g atp cell 3 1 the intact cell yield yicc and atp yield yatp based on the growth curves of tap water vs ro water the bgpicc and bgpatp were determined for each carbon concentration 0 300 µg l ac c based on the 14 days growth curves of icc fig 3 and atp fig 4 the atp concentration after pasteurisation on the first test day was 0 1 ng l in both water types however the corresponding icc in ro treated water was 103 icc ml whereas tap water contained around 100 103 icc ml of pasteurisation resistant cells which could not grow during the growth test period sousi et al 2020b for ro water it was observed that the growth peak was quicker obtained with atp than icc 3 days vs 4 7 days for all carbon concentrations similar phenomenon was observed for tap water when 5 µg l ac c was added where a second atp peak was also observed after 7 10 days however for tap water with low carbon concentrations 0 5 µg l ac c both atp and icc peaks were obtained after 7 10 days in addition figs 3 and 4 clearly demonstrate that atp concentration significantly dropped after reaching the peak especially with the addition of high carbon concentrations irrespective of the type of water on the contrary icc was maintained around the peak value until day 14 when considering low carbon concentrations 0 100 µg l ac c whereas a drop in icc was observed after day 4 6 at carbon concentrations of 200 and 300 µg l ac c the analysis of fcm data showed that 80 of the cells growing in tap water and ro water were hna bacteria however both fsc and ssc signals were higher for ro water than tap water at all carbon concentrations indicating larger bacterial cells in ro water i e an average of 2200 vs 880 for fsc and 2100 vs 1200 for ssc respectively table s4 yicc and yatp for both water types were determined based on the slope of the linear increase in bgpicc and bgpatp with the standard addition of carbon up to 100 µg l ac c fig 5 where carbon was not limiting the growth due to the addition of phosphate 1 µg l po4 p and nitrogen 10 µg l no3 n according to the ratio of c n p 100 10 1 the yicc for ro water was 4 6 0 1 106 cells µg c which was not influenced by the addition of trace elements k co h3bo3 mn zn fe and s fig s2 indicating that these trace elements were not the limiting factor for bacterial growth even in the ultrapure ro treated water for tap water the yicc was 9 8 0 6 106 cells µg c which was 2 times higher than that in the ro water fig 5a conversely the yatp for both water types was similar ratio of 1 which was 0 39 0 12 and 0 42 0 06 ng atp µg c for tap water and ro water respectively fig 5b based on the icc and atp results the maximum atp per cell was calculated for each carbon concentration fig s3 the atp per cell values for ro water were consistently 2 4 times higher than these for tap water where the spike of carbon in ro water resulted in an increase of 50 in atp per cell even at 5 µg l ac c while for tap water the atp per cell values were stable around the same level for the whole carbon range of 0 300 µg l ac c 3 2 growth limiting nutrient identified by bgpicc and bgpatp for tap water vs ro water as shown in fig s4 both bgpicc and bgpatp of tap water without the addition of nutrients were comparable to these of tap water with 1 µg l po4 p and 10 µg l no3 n added fig s5 shows similar observations for ro water therefore both bgpicc and bgpatp revealed that carbon was the growth limiting nutrient in tap water as well as ro water when carbon was added clear differences were observed fig 6 for tap water a linear increase in bgpicc was observed until the addition of 100 µg l ac c when the ratio of added c n p was 100 10 1 fig 6a left afterwards a plateaued curve was established where the difference in bgpicc was insignificant for 100 200 or 300 µg l ac c addition p 0 05 fig 6a right the bgpicc of tap water increased from 454 65 103 icc ml with no carbon addition to the level of 1500 103 icc ml with the addition of 100 200 or 300 µg l ac c indicating that there might be other elements e g phosphate limiting cell multiplication on the contrary such a trend was not observed for bgpatp with the addition of carbon from 0 to 300 µg l ac c the bgpatp of tap water showed a linear increase from 21 41 1 62 ng atp l to 130 32 27 14 ng atp l fig 6b the different trends observed for bgpicc and bgpatp indicate that though the cell number reached a stable level due to the limitation on cell multiplication the cellular activity kept increasing to obtain a holistic view the actual c n p ratio was calculated by including the internally available nutrients in tap water and ro water table s5 the original aoc in tap water was 45 µg l ac c 10 times higher than aoc p17 and nox considering the yicc obtained in fig 5a meaning that the actual c n p ratio was 145 2910 2 with the addition of 100 µg l ac c on the other hand for ro water both bgpicc and bgpatp increased linearly along the whole range of carbon addition from 0 to 300 µg l ac c fig 6a and b indicating that there was no growth or activity limitation observed for ro water remarkably the bgpicc for ro water was approaching but did not reach the cell number limitation observed for tap water 1 327 48 103 vs 1 500 103 icc ml 4 discussion intact cell count icc and atp measurements were used to evaluate the bacterial growth potential of conventionally treated water tap water and ultra low nutrient water prepared by remineralising ro permeate ro water combining the results obtained by intact cell count and atp allowed for integral understanding of the bacterial growth characteristics of each water type in addition trace elements n p and different concentrations of acetate carbon were added for performing a matrix of bgp tests which allowed for the investigation of growth limiting factors and the comparison between icc and atp for measuring bacterial growth dynamics 4 1 reduction in bgpicc and bgpatp achieved by ro based treatment in the present study both bgpicc and bgpatp showed that ro based treatment ro water resulted in a significantly lower bgp than that of conventional treatment tap water fig 2 which is in line with previous findings on ro performance for controlling bacterial growth park and hu 2010 thayanukul et al 2013 sousi et al 2020a this could be explained by the high aoc rejection efficiency of ro membrane escobar et al 2000 hong et al 2005 in addition although the same bacterial consortium was inoculated in both water types the difference in water matrix might have also contributed to the reduction in bgp achieved by ro treatment such as the difference in inorganic and or trace elements for example the conductivity in ro water was 3 times lower than that of tap water 20 9 ms m vs 63 2 ms m table s2 the bgp tests performed on ro water with addition of ca mg hco3 and other essential trace elements i e k co zn fe mn s and hydrogen borate confirmed that none of these elements was the growth limiting factor in the ultra low nutrient ro permeate based on the previous observations it is hypothesised that bacterial in ro treated water might be limited not only by organic compounds but also by certain inorganic constituents that were present in tap water at extremely low concentrations which were not included in this study however the results revealed that the magnitude of bgp reduction was dependent on the parameter used where bgpicc showed a higher reduction ratio 7 5 times compared with bgpatp 4 5 times the different degree of bacterial growth measured by icc and atp was previously reported and attributed to the discrepancy of the two measurements and the possibility of missing the atp peak because of the rapid increase and collapse in atp values when readily available carbon such as acetate is added farhat et al 2018 such discrepancies were observed in the present study where the measurement of bacterial growth with the addition of acetate carbon revealed that the atp peak was obtained after 3 days while the icc reached the peak within 4 7 days figs 3 and 4 moreover farhat et al 2018 argued that both methods are accurate and reliable while the definition of growth in terms of cell multiplication or active biomass formation dictates which method evaluates the growth better and suggested that the combination of bgpicc and bgpatp together with the parameter atp per cell offers more insights into growth potential although the same bacteria originating from conventionally treated water were used as an inoculum in the present study the atp per cell of ro water was consistently higher 2 4 times than that of tap water indicating that there might be different bacteria thrived in the two water types the higher atp per cell in ro water was in line with the fcm data fsc and ssc signals which were higher in ro water compared with tap water affirming the larger cell size in ro water wang et al 2009 sousi et al 2020a it is well known that the level of atp production is influenced by environmental conditions hespell and bryant 1979 boström and törnblom 1990 where atp production would be affected when cells are subjected to conditions that are different from their original environment which could explain the higher atp per cell in ro water compared with tap water moreover the standard carbon addition tests showed that the tap water bacterial consortium inoculated in ro water converted carbon into atp for bioactivities e g synthesis of reserve materials mobility hammes et al 2010 mempin et al 2013 as efficient as in their own water where a comparable yatp was observed in both water types however two atp peaks were observed in tap water corresponding to the added readily available organic carbon first peak and the natural organic compounds present in water second peak van der kooij et al 2017 the second peak was not observed in ro water because of its ultra low nutrient content specifically complex organic compounds as measured by lc ocd table s2 the concentration of atp quickly dropped after the first peak in both water types which could be attributed to the rapid response of atp production to environmental changes i e the addition and consumption of acetate in this case the drop in intracellular atp concentrations could imply increasing extracellular atp during growth mempin et al 2013 ihssen et al 2021 or an actual decrease in intracellular atp due to physiological reasons i e less active cells the quick drop in intracellular atp was not accompanied with a significant decrease in cell numbers indicating that cells were maintaining themselves with low levels of energy and bioactivities bacterial growth in term of intact cell count and thus intact cell yield was significantly affected by the change in the surrounding environment tap water vs ro water where the rate of cell synthesis in ro water was hindered according to this comparison it is suggested that bacteria inoculated in an unfavourable environment ro water tend to covert available nutrients into energy source atp for surviving rather than synthesising new cells although the same inoculum was used there might be different bacteria thrived in tap water and ro water especially considering the significantly different atp per cell between the two water types for future research it is recommended to investigate the dynamics of bacterial communities and identify which members become dominant during bacterial growth in each water type which will be valuable for understanding bacterial growth from community composition and structure level this is especially important considering that each water type contained different bacterial communities sousi et al 2020a 4 2 the role of phosphate in bacterial growth and the maximum intact cell yield per µg po4 p in the present study both bgpatp and bgpicc clearly showed that carbon was the growth limiting nutrient in tap water and ro water however different trends of bacterial growth were observed when 100 µg l ac c was added which could be attributed to the phosphate limitation established in tap water this is because nitrogen limitation could be clearly excluded as a result of the data presented in table s2 i e excess no3 n at 2910 and 260 μg l in tap water and ro water respectively additionally no growth limitation effect was observed for a wide range of trace elements k ca mg mn co zn fe h3bo3 and s fig s2 where even in ro water there were sufficient trace elements for cell multiplication until the addition of 300 µg l ac c fig 6a therefore trace elements limitation was excluded as such the actual c p ratio when changing from carbon limited fig 1 zone b to carbon excess fig 1 zone c conditions in tap water was 145 2 which is between the redfield ratio of 100 1 hammes and egli 2005 and the 50 3 ratio for exponentially growing cells under carbon limited conditions egli 2009 this complies with the consensus of variable microbial cell composition which is highly dependent on the cultivation conditions herbert 1961 the difference regarding the bgpicc and bgpatp trends of tap water with phosphate limitation suggested that phosphate is an essential element necessary for biomass synthesis jansson 1988 miettinen et al 1997 but phosphate limitation did not influence the formation of bacterial atp because carbon was the main nutrient needed by bacteria to produce atp required for bio activities regardless whether new biomass was synthesised or not giorgio and cole 1998 in other words this finding indicates that bgpatp cannot be used to detect phosphate limitation in water or to measure growth potential in term of cell synthesis when phosphate is the growth limiting nutrient interestingly the maximum number of cells obtained in tap water at 100 µg l ac c addition and in ro water at 300 µg l ac c addition was in the same range 1 3 1 5 106 icc ml therefore it is reasonable to hypothesise that this is the maximum intact cell count which could be synthesised out of the total available phosphate i e phosphate already present in water as well as the added 1 µg l po4 p assuming that the already present phosphate in water was around the method detection limit of 1 µg l po4 p reported values were 0 8 0 9 µg l po4 p for both water types intact cell yield growing on phosphate could be estimated in the range of 0 70 0 05 109 cells µg po4 p indicating that significant bacterial growth could be promoted at extremely low phosphate concentrations miettinen et al 1997 to the best of our knowledge this is the very first study discussing the potential intact cell yield quantified by fcm on phosphate in drinking water where there was no data available for comparison the reported yield based on the standard plate count method was about 3 73 105 cfu µg po4 p lehtola et al 1999 which is much lower than that obtained based on fcm this difference might be caused by the fact that only pseudomonas fluorescens p17 was used and less than 1 of bacteria in water could be plate cultivated hammes and egli 2005 van nevel et al 2017 it is worthwhile to mention that a different cell yield based on phosphate can be obtained for other types of water which was observed in this study for cell yield based on carbon i e different cell yield between tap water and ro treated water 4 3 practical insights bgp test bgpicc and bgpatp are increasingly applied for the assessment of biological stability of drinking water in general it is agreed that both methods are rapid accurate and reproducible where bgpicc measures cell synthesis and bgpatp measures cellular activity vital et al 2012 prest et al 2016a van der kooij et al 2017 farhat et al 2018 sousi et al 2020a as reported in this study and elsewhere the combination of bgpicc and bgpatp in addition to the traditional methods for cell measurement such the determination of cell density and bio volume can provide more insights into the bacterial growth e g in depth understanding of cell growth stages and the role of growth limiting nutrients in addition the present study has also demonstrated bgpatp could not reveal the bgp of phosphate limited samples therefore for the choice of bgp method bgpicc would be suitable for all cases while bgpatp should be applied only on the carbon limitation cases since most of drinking water is carbon limited van der kooij et al 1982 huck 1990 schurer et al 2019 sousi et al 2020a both methods are suitable to be used for bacterial growth potential assessment microbially available phosphate map as discussed in this study and elsewhere it is clear that even a very low concentration of phosphate 1 µg l po4 p can promote extensive microbial growth e g 106 icc ml lehtola et al 1999 nescerecka et al 2018 however the traditional method for phosphate measurement with the current detection limit of 1 µg l po4 p can hardly be helpful for bacterial growth evaluation using pseudomonas fluorescens p17 and plate count lehtola et al 1999 was able to develop a sensitive bioassay for determining map in water with a detection limit of 0 08 µg l po4 p the present study demonstrated that by using natural bacterial consortium as an inoculum and applying fcm for intact cell quantification the map bioassay could be significantly improved regarding the representativity and sensitivity i e lower limit of detection such a bioassay will be especially valuable for the ultra low nutrient drinking water where phosphate concentration is below the current detection limit but the bacterial growth in water might be phosphate limited another advantage of such a bioassay is that it can be used to measure all types of phosphate that are of importance for bacterial growth in drinking water 5 conclusions the assessment of bacterial growth potential bgp using both flow cytometric intact cell count icc and adenosine triphosphate atp is especially useful as additional complementary information can be obtained from the combined tests bgpicc and bgpatp comparing conventionally treated drinking water tap water and ultra low nutrient water prepared by remineralising ro permeate ro water using both methods revealed that although the same bacterial inoculum originating from tap water was used the bgpicc ratio between tap water ro water was about 7 5 whereas the bgpatp ratio was about 4 5 regarding the yield of bacteria growing on acetate a comparable atp yield was obtained for tap water and ro water 0 39 0 12 vs 0 42 0 06 ng atp µg c respectively whereas the intact cell yield was significantly different 9 8 0 6 106 vs 4 6 0 8 106 cells µg c a consistently higher atp per cell was observed for ro water compared with tap water which could be attributed to the fact that the inoculum used was adapted to a significantly higher salinity and a broader range of trace elements than these present in remineralised ro permeate this indicates that bacterial growth in ultra low nutrient water could be limited not only by organic compounds but also inorganic constituents carbon was identified as the growth limiting nutrient in the two types of water studied by both bgpicc and bgpatp with the addition of extra carbon phosphate limitation was detected with bgpicc but not bgpatp suggesting that a combination of carbon and phosphate is essential for the synthesis of new cells whereas carbon is probably used as an energy source for other bacterial activities measured by atp when phosphate is limited the intact cell yield growing on phosphate was estimated at 0 70 0 05 109 cells µg po4 p indicating that significant bacterial growth could be promoted when extremely low concentrations of phosphate are available declaration of competing interest none

16689,a novel design for a flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi system consisting of tubular electrodes in a shell and tube heat exchanger configuration is proposed each electrode consists of a metallic mesh current collector along the inner circumference of a tubular ion exchange membrane this tubular fcdi design is suitable for scale up as it consists of easily manufactured components which can be assembled in an array an apparatus with 4 tubular electrodes with a large effective area 202 3 cm2 was constructed and shown to provide a high net salt nacl removal rate 0 15 mg s 1 at 1 2 v applied voltage and 2000 mg l 1 influent total dissolved solids concentration a computational fluid dynamics cfd model incorporating ion migration and transport mechanisms was developed to simulate the ion concentration and electrical potential profiles in the water channel the results of cfd modelling highlighted the need to maximize regions of both high potential gradient and high hydraulic flow in order to achieve optimal salt removal in brief this study presents a new design approach for fcdi scale up and provides a computational tool for optimization of this design and future innovative fcdi designs graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is a class of technologies applicable to brackish water desalination via the removal of ionic contaminants through the application of an electrical potential across pairs of electrodes through which the feed stream passes in fixed electrode cdi ions are removed from the feed stream during the charging phase as a result of electrostatic migration and electrosorption anderson et al 2010 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 resulting in a decrease in the salinity of the product stream membrane capacitive deionization mcdi is a subclass of cdi where ion exchange membranes iem are placed on the surfaces of the electrodes to prevent adsorption of counter ions in the electrode discharge phase biesheuvel et al 2011 individual commercial mcdi modules capable of production rates of several cubic meters per day have been developed with units typically powered by mains supply given the low potential used to electrosorb ions and the dc current used mcdi units are well suited to being powered using photovoltaics and battery energy storage with the result that the technology is electrically compatible with off grid operation tan et al 2020 tan et al 2018 as mcdi operation involves cycling between charging and discharging stages for each individual module it is a discontinuous process which can be difficult and costly to scale thus flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi with the solid carbon electrodes replaced by flowable carbon suspensions has been developed in recent years as a steady state cdi process ma et al 2019b yang et al 2017 as the charged carbon particles can be transported out of the water treatment reactor it is possible to regenerate the carbon external to the reactor allowing for continuous operation cho et al 2017 doornbusch et al 2016 gendel et al 2014 he et al 2018 ma et al 2019b rommerskirchen et al 2015 rommerskirchen et al 2018a yang et al 2016a yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b eliminating the need for switching between charging and discharging stages and the associated inefficiencies due to mixing solutions of different concentrations hawks et al 2018 the mobile nature of the electrodes also provides the ability to physically or chemically manipulate the flow electrodes during operation permitting enhanced removal and or recovery of targeted species zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2021 the original fcdi units consisted of narrow serpentine flow electrode channels milled into stainless steel plates which also act as the current collector gendel et al 2014 jeon et al 2013 with steel later substituted for graphite due to concerns regarding corrosion and difficulty of manufacture hatzell et al 2015 rommerskirchen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2016a more recently titanium and conductive carbon mesh have been employed as the current collector with the mesh placed on the iem surface allowing for simultaneous contact between the iem current collector and carbon particles with resultant highly effective charge transfer in the flow electrode linnartz et al 2020 yang et al 2019 in the conventional fcdi design with serpentine channels only the surface area of the narrow channels can be considered to be effective in imparting charge given typical limiting current densities 20 a m 2 laboratory scale fcdi units have generally been limited to operating at currents under 0 5 a ma et al 2018 ma et al 2020 rommerskirchen et al 2015 the exceptions are studies using seawater influent for which currents up to 10 5 a have been reported jeon et al 2014 yang et al 2016b the complexity of milling a single long and narrow channel into both sides of a graphite or stainless steel plate limits further scale up due to the technical difficulty and associated expense of the milling process new designs for fcdi electrodes with improved ease of fabrication and greater effective area are therefore needed tubular flow channels would seem particularly suitable as conduits for the carbon suspension flow of fcdi with the possibility that these flow channels could be constrained within tubular ion exchange membranes indeed tubular membranes have been widely used in conventional membrane separation processes particularly for feed streams with high turbidity or solids content as they are more resilient to fouling and clogging additionally tubular membranes are relatively easy to manufacture and since they represent the entire flow channel avoid the need for the graphite machining step as the design does not require guides for the carbon flow the entirety of the iem area of tubular fcdi electrodes can be exposed to both the electrode slurry and feed streams cylindrical electrodes also exhibit a greater effective area for a given reactor volume as demonstrated with electrochemical reactors percin et al 2020 arrays of tubular electrodes with alternating anode and cathode channels surrounded by the feed solution have already been demonstrated to be feasible for fcdi desalination while achieving a high effective area cho et al 2017 choo et al 2019 while the use of a tubular flow electrode design appears feasible there is considerable uncertainty regarding the flow distribution within the reactor and its effects on the ion distribution during steady state operation particularly in view of the relatively complex geometry of the water sheath between the tubular fcdi electrodes in the current research a tubular fcdi was designed and fabricated to evaluate its desalination performance with computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling of water and ion transport within the unit used to strengthen our understanding of the impact of design and operational variables on system performance mechanistic models have been previously developed to predict fcdi performance however these studies have all been limited to planar fcdi geometries with a one dimensional spacer channel rommerskirchen et al 2018b wang et al 2020 computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation was used in this work to investigate the interrelationship among the hydraulic behavior electrical potential field and ion mass transport in the fcdi water channel cfd has been previously used in simulating flow patterns in reverse electrodialysis red gurreri et al 2014 2016 la cerva et al 2017 pawlowski et al 2016 and m cdi modules jeon et al 2017 kwon and rhim 2016 liu and wang 2021 mostly focusing on promoting hydraulic mixing cfd models in these studies often assume a constant ion flux proportional to the current density which is valid for the planar iems but is not appropriate for the proposed tubular fcdi geometry as the geometry between the electrodes of the tubular fcdi design will result in a non uniform electrical potential field the ion flux over the iem surface will be also non uniform necessitating an alternative simulation method for describing the ion flux in this study a novel cfd modelling method is developed to predict ion flux based on the electrical potential gradient and ion concentration on the surface of the iem at each node the model developed here is focused on the water channel of the tubular fcdi module with an assumption of constant potential and ion concentration boundary conditions in the carbon flow channel 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction 2 1 1 tubular iem the tubular iems were produced from flat sheet iems anion exchange membrane aem aem type ii fujifilm europe cation exchange membrane cem cem type ii fujifilm europe ribbons of iem measuring 500 mm x 25 mm were cut and then wound around a cylindrical rod of 14 mm diameter with a 2 mm overlap along the long edge figure 1 c an adhesive epoxy resin selleys araldite super strength was applied along the entirety of the overlap in a thin layer the adhesive was left to set before the iem tube was removed from the rod and trimmed to rectangular ends figure s1 a the tubular iems were left in their dry state as assembly required further use of adhesive 2 1 2 current collectors for the current collectors a titanium mesh adjacent to the iem was employed inspired by the titanium mesh membrane assembly design used by yang et al yang et al 2019 for each current collector a 1 mm diameter titanium wire was secured to a 240 mm x 50 mm sheet of titanium mesh anping hebei hongyun metal product co ltd the mesh represents the active current collector with the wire extending from the current collector allowing for connection to the appropriate electrical terminal 2 1 3 assembly the iem tubes were glued to holes on the upper and lower endplates and joined to the outer casing ensuring a watertight seal the holes were arranged in a square array with spacings of 2 mm between holes representing the minimum gap between adjacent electrodes for the passage of the influent solution each rectangular titanium mesh was wound around a cylindrical rod inserted into the tubular iem and then released allowing the current collector to expand and fit evenly around the inner circumference of the iem as depicted in figure 1 c and figure s1 b between the endplates the exposed length of each tubular electrode was 230 mm with 4 tubes the total effective area was 202 3 cm2 2 2 experimental method the pumping of the solution in the influent channel outside shell and the flow electrode suspension inside tube was accomplished using separate peristaltic pump heads longerpump bt100 1l a dc power supply powertech mp3840 was connected to the electrode terminals of the fcdi unit to supply the necessary electrical power for fcdi desalination a data logger sensordaq vernier along with attachments to measure potential difference vp bta vernier current dcp bta vernier and ionic conductivity con bta vernier was used to record the experimental data the influent solution used was 2000 mg l 1 nacl prepared using 18 2 mω cm 1 milli q water millipore and nacl solute sigma aldrich acs reagent 99 0 the influent solution was pumped upwards through the water sheath in a single pass configuration the influent solution was pumped through the apparatus at various flow rates 23 5 31 3 39 1 0 4 ml min 1 with the conductivity probe used to provide a continuous measure of the salinity of the product stream the flow electrode suspension used was 10 w w darco activated carbon sigma aldrich 100 mesh powder in 2000 mg l 1 nacl the 10 w w mass loading used here represents a moderate loading that has been shown to provide reasonably high performance ma et al 2018 without being excessively viscous as is the case with 20 w w hatzell et al 2017 carbon mass consisted of only commercially available darco activated carbon powder with no conductive additives e g carbon black liang et al 2017 ma et al 2019a with this composition chosen as a benchmark for minimum performance with the 4 tube fcdi in a vertical orientation figure s1 c the carbon suspension entered at the top via a single nozzle with the carbon suspension splashing and trickling down the inner walls of the flow electrodes at the bottom the carbon suspension dropped through the air gap into the reservoir and was subsequently pumped back to the top of the fcdi at a rate of 313 3 ml min 1 the total batch volume of the carbon suspension was 1 0 l we attempted to induce parallel flow in previous prototypes by construction of multiple tubular electrodes connected in parallel although these attempts were unsuccessful due to the inability to maintain consistent carbon flow through all electrodes with any variation in the flow rate between channels carbon settling and the increased hydraulic resistance along one channel will eventually result in zero carbon suspension flow through that channel as the bulk of the flow takes the path of least resistance eventually as individual channels become sequentially blocked the carbon flow only occurs in one channel and other channels begin to saturate with top to bottom carbon flow gravity acts to promote carbon flow and the settling does not result in blockages the design of the fcdi with tubular electrodes was such that the carbon suspension is regenerated by charge neutralization through physical contact of the oppositely charged flow electrodes a method referred to as short circuited closed cycled scc operation he et al 2018 yang et al 2017 the flow anode and flow cathode from each tubular electrode were combined into a single body at the reservoir with the suspension then passing through a peristaltic pump to promote mixing before being reintroduced into the fcdi reactor scc operation is intended to allow for continuous and steady state fcdi desalination with a single fcdi reactor the electrodes were charged with the application of a constant current cc using the dc power supply the applied current ranged between 0 15 0 35 a at the terminals of the fcdi average current density 7 4 17 3 a m 2 provided that the potential difference at the terminals did not exceed 2 0 v extended operation above 2 0 v was not carried out as water dissociation and corrosion of the titanium current collector were expected to occur the potential difference across and current through the fcdi terminals were measured during operation 2 3 computational fluid dynamics modelling cfd simulation was used to investigate the transport of ionic species in the water channel inside of the tubular fcdi module under the combined effect of convection diffusion and electrical potential forces 2 3 1 governing equations the governing equations for the fluid domain are the continuity equation conservation of mass represented as 1 ρ t ρ v 0 and the momentum equation represented as 2 t ρ v ρ v v p σ where ρ is the volume averaged density v is the flow velocity p is the static pressure and σ is the stress tensor the mass transfer of salt species i e na and cl was simulated by considering the effect of convection diffusion and ion migration under an electrical potential field 3 t ρ y i ρ v y i ρ d i y i s m i where y i represents the mass fraction of the ith ions and d i is the diffusion coefficient of the ith ions with d i set to 1 33 10 9 m2 s 1 and 2 03 10 9 m2 s 1 for na and cl respectively as the fcdi operation was tested under constant room temperature the thermal diffusion of salt was neglected s m i represents the source term for the ith ion which is used to induce ion transfer at the surfaces of the iem in the fcdi model the mass transfer of ions was modelled using the mass jump method developed in a previous study of membrane desalination processes lian et al 2016 through a user developed function udf code the na and cl ions are removed from the boundary layer cell directly adjacent to the cation exchange membrane cem and the anion exchange membrane aem respectively the source term s m i can therefore be written as 4 s m i j i a c v c for iem surface cells 0 for other cells where a c m2 and v c m3 are the cross sectional area and volume for each boundary layer cell respectively the nernst planck equation has been widely used in predicting ion flux through iems in mechanistic models of cdi and fcdi dykstra et al 2016 rommerskirchen et al 2018b wang and lin 2019 wang et al 2020 the nernst planck equation allows for the implementation of ion transport through diffusion and electromigration mechanisms as follows 5 j i n p d i c i x z i c i ϕ x where j i n p is the ion flux mol m 2 s 1 as predicted by the nernst planck equation d i is the ion diffusion coefficient m2 s 1 z i is the ion valence c i is the ion concentration mol m 3 and ϕ is the dimensionless potential several assumptions were made in the implementation of the ion flux equation in the cfd model firstly a constant electrical potential and ion concentration was assumed for the carbon flow channel of the tubular iem secondly ion mass diffusion across the iem was neglected as the ion concentration differences between the carbon channels and the water channel are low zhang et al 2020 thirdly the ionic conductivity was assumed to be a constant 0 36 s m 1 throughout the spacer channel finally with only na and cl ions present in the system z i takes the value of one therefore the above equation simplifies to 6 j i c f d k i c i m e m v m e m where j i c f d kg m 2 s 1 is the ion flux predicted by cfd simulation at each node k i is the ion mass transfer coefficient of each ion calculated based on their ion diffusion coefficient in water using the subsequent equations c i m e m is the ion concentration kg kg 1 of the relevant ion species adjacent to the iem surface and v m e m is the potential gradient v m 1 over first layer of simulation cells that are adjacent to the iem surface ion concentrations and potential gradients are calculated at each node on the first layer cell adjacent to the anodes and cathodes resulting in a spatially varying ion flux across the electrode boundaries the ion mass transfer coefficient k i kg m 1 s 1 v 1 was calculated from the ion diffusion coefficient d i m2 s 1 by 7 k i d i ρ n a c l v t 8 v t r t f where v t v is the thermal voltage for t 300 k with the gas constant r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and faraday s constant f 96485 c mol 1 d i are 1 33 10 9 m2 s 1 and 2 03 10 9 m2 s 1 for the sodium ion and chloride ion respectively and ρ n a c l 2130 kg m 3 for each set of operating conditions matching the experimental pumping rate and steady state current the cfd model generated hydraulic ion concentration and electrical potential distributions in the fcdi module at steady state operation to calibrate the cfd model the experimental steady state electrode voltages were multiplied by a reduction factor α constant for all operating conditions as a model fitting parameter according to previous fcdi modelling work by wang et al the potential difference across the spacer channel is approximately 10 of the applied potential difference after accounting for electrical electrode membrane and donnan resistances wang et al 2020 the reduced potential difference was employed in the udf to calculate salt flux and in the spacer channel to compute electrostatic ion transport 2 3 2 model geometry and simulation setup all simulations were carried out using ansys fluent version 2019r3 a three dimensional fluid domain with two pairs of iem tubes was built to represent the feed water channel of the previously described fcdi module a sweep method where a surface mesh was extended with defined spacing to represent any arbitrary cross section was used to achieve a unified mesh size 1 1 10 3 m along the axial direction of the membrane adjacent to the iem surfaces 5 layers of grid inflations with a first layer thickness of 2 5 10 5 m were applied at the liquid membrane interfaces ensuring the zones where electrical potential concentration polarization and transport phenomena occur were simulated using a higher mesh resolution a grid size of 3 10 4 m was employed across the remainder of the membrane bundle laminar flow conditions were used to calculate fluid flow in the water channel cfd simulation shows that the average reynolds number in the flow channel is around 1 2 and the maximum is 84 5 which are within the laminar flow regime the mass flowrate of the water inlet was set based on the pump flow rate during experimental operation 23 5 31 3 39 1 ml min 1 of 2000 mg l 1 nacl i e mass fractions of 787 and 1213 mg l 1 for na and cl respectively these flow rates correspond to flow velocities of 0 0553 0 0738 0 0922 m s 1 at the inlet all iem and structural walls of the water sheath were set as no slip boundary conditions the electromigration of ions under an applied electrical field is accounted for using the electrolyte model in ansys fluent all simulations were performed using the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm for pressure velocity coupling and the second order upwind algorithm for discretization of the conservation equations a convergence level below 10 6 was achieved for the potential residual and below 10 5 for all other terms mesh independence was verified by varying the number of divisions 100 200 300 400 along the axial direction of the tubular fcdi the delta concentration values at steady state operation for cell sizes of 2 2 1 1 0 73 0 55 mm are presented in figure s2 showing only a 1 4 range a unified mesh size of 1 1 10 3 m was selected and all modelling results presented are based on this axial mesh size 2 4 standard performance metrics the standard metrics for fcdi desalination performance as described by he et al and ma et al were calculated from the experimental results to describe electrical efficiency desalination rate and energy consumption and to aid comparison with other studies he et al 2018 ma et al 2018 the coulombic efficiency ce the ratio of charge of ions removed to electrical charge input the average salt removal rate asrr µmol cm 2 min 1 the rate of salt removal per unit area per unit time and the energy normalized salt removal enrs µmol j 1 a measure of the amount of salt removed per input of electrical energy were calculated as follows ce total charge of ions removed total charge supplied to

sodium chloride q is the feed solution flow rate i is the applied current v is the applied voltage a e f f is the effective area and t is the elapsed time the ion concentration at the surface of the fcdi electrodes as predicted by the cfd model was evaluated using concentration polarization indices cpi as defined by bhattacharya and hwang with the equation cpi ion concentration at membrane surface ion concentration in the bulk feed c m x c 0 where c m x is the ion concentration of a specific finite element at the membrane surface and c 0 is the ion concentration of the feed solution bhattacharya and hwang 1997 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results an fcdi apparatus with 4 tubular electrodes was constructed and operated demonstrating successful desalination as evident from figure 2 the application of a potential difference to the terminals of the fcdi unit resulted in the passage of current and proportional removal of salt from the 2000 mg l 1 nacl influent solution scc fcdi operation is intended to result in a temporally steady cell voltage for a constant applied current doornbusch et al 2016 he et al 2018 yang et al 2017 given the stability of the measured terminal voltage over each 1200 s period once steady state operation was attained figure 2 a the flow electrodes for the 4 tube fcdi were adequately regenerated during operation so electrosorption was not limited by the electrosorption capacity of the carbon particles the following performance data for the tubular fcdi unit is presented for steady state operation and was collected 600 1800 s after each change in current the 600 s delay prior to data collection accounting for the delay before the resumption of steady state conditions for the product stream concentration and the potential difference across the fcdi for a particular influent flow rate the application of a higher current resulted in a lower ion concentration in the product stream as evident from figure 2 c this is due to more ions being removed as evident from the graph of ion removal rate against the applied current shown in figure 2 d the highest average rate of ion removal achieved was 0 212 0 001 mg s 1 with the 4 tube fcdi operating at a flow rate of 39 1 ml min 1 and an applied current of 0 35 a given that the performance for all flow rates and applied currents lies near the line of charge equivalence figure 2 d the input of electrical charge has resulted in the equivalent removal of ions which indicates that the fcdi unit is operating at close to ideal electrical performance for the present design for operation with all applied currents and influent flow rates the ce for the 4 tube fcdi was consistently observed to be over 92 figure 3 a with a high near unity ce the input of a greater amount of electrical charge will result in proportionally more desalination this was also reflected in figure 2 d with the net rate of salt removal approximately equivalent to the current being supplied to the fcdi on an equivalent charge basis as represented by the line of ideal ce the asrr of the 4 tube fcdi was observed to be between 0 43 1 08 μmol cm 2 min 1 figure 3 b with an applied voltage of up to 2 0 v and an influent solution of 2000 mg l 1 nacl as is to be expected from operation with a consistent ce the asrr increases with increasing voltage due to the higher current and therefore current density passing through the fcdi unit the highest asrr of 1 08 0 01 μmol cm 2 min 1 was achieved with a flow rate of 39 1 ml min 1 and an applied current of 0 35 a average current density 17 3 a m 2 this result is lower than several previous studies in which small scale fcdi units with tortuous channels have been observed to operate at asrr in excess of 2 0 μmol cm 2 min 1 e g 2 25 μmol cm 2 min 1 ma et al 2020 however the advantage of the 4 tube fcdi is the significantly larger effective area of 202 3 cm2 compared to less than 60 cm2 for most other studies which translates to several times greater net salt removal rate e g 0 21 mg s 1 with the 4 tube fcdi vs 0 03 mg s 1 for ma et al with an effective area of only 11 9 cm2 the enrs was observed to be between 4 9 13 9 μmol j 1 figure 3 c which is a similar range to that reported in other fcdi studies for operation in the range of 0 7 2 0 v the energy consumption of the 4 tube fcdi is reasonable with energy not being excessively wasted the enrs decreased with larger applied voltages across the terminals of the 4 tube fcdi corresponding with the general trend of fcdi technologies being less energy efficient at higher operating voltages a plot of enrs vs asrr is presented in figure 3 d and provides a useful overview of the overall desalination and energy performance of the tubular fcdi unit as suggested by hawks et al hawks et al 2019 a plot of energy consumption kwh m 3 vs productivity l h 1 m 2 is also provided in figure s3 for comparison with other cdi architectures 3 2 computational fluid dynamics modelling 3 2 1 model validation to calibrate the cfd model the voltage reduction factor α was determined to be 0 28 from experimental results when operating with various single pass flow rates and applied currents figure 4 the range of potential differences across the spacer channel was therefore 0 26 0 55 v as presented in table 1 the percentage differences between the outlet concentration as obtained by the cfd model and by experimental means are generally below 10 with this good agreement validating the cfd model under the tested operating conditions 3 2 2 simulation results contour plots for flow velocity electrical potential and na and cl ion concentrations from the cfd modelling are presented in figure 5 the greatest potential gradients occur around the narrowest points between two adjacent oppositely charged electrodes figure 5 b the model predicts a potential gradient of around 3 2 101 v m 1 at the closest points between adjacent electrodes whereas the lowest potential gradients approximately 3 3 10 2 v m 1 are located nearest to the outer shell wall with three orders of magnitude variation in the potential gradient the ion flux through each electrode is expected to be heavily impacted by spatial factors as for the hydraulic flow in the water channel the 2 mm gap between adjacent tubular electrodes represents a constriction leading to an increased hydraulic resistance and a lower flow for the cross section midway along the height of the tubular fcdi unit figure 5 a the midpoint of the gap along the plane with the inlet and outlet line 1 1 registered a flow velocity of 7 3 10 4 m s 1 whereas the transverse plane line 2 2 experienced an even lower flow velocity of only 3 9 10 4 m s 1 with na sinks at the negative cathodes and cl sinks at the positive anodes the local ion concentration decreases especially at the regions of high electrical potential gradient and low hydraulic flow velocity it is possible that localized depletion of ions may occur due to the low ion conduction rate resulting from the low local flowrate which would result in a lower overall ion removal rate the feed na and cl concentrations were 787 and 1213 mg l 1 amounting to the nacl concentration of the 2000 mg l 1 in the feed solution for all cases as shown in figure 5 c d the minimum ion concentrations at the relevant electrodes as predicted by the cfd model was 267 mg l 1 for na at the cathode and 222 mg l 1 for cl at the anode therefore the cpi corresponding to the minima are 0 339 and 0 183 respectively for na and cl with a large deviation from unity representing a high degree of polarization bhattacharya and hwang 1997 as these indices are substantially below unity the ion removal rate is expected to be significantly diminished by the reasonably high degree of concentration polarization this is likely a determining factor for the steady state current and voltage of the fcdi unit as concentration polarization must be overcome by the supplied electrical energy nonetheless the cpi are within one order of magnitude of unity so ions are not extremely depleted at the membrane surfaces during steady state operation and ion removal can still occur concentration polarization can be reduced by promoting hydraulic flow on the surfaces of the electrodes which will result in a greater ion removal the influence of hydraulic flow and potential gradient can be observed in the cfd model predictions of ion flux around the circumference of a fcdi electrode figure 6 a presents the ion flux and potential gradient around the circumference of the cathode nearest the inlet at three heights the potential gradient profile varied minimally with height ion flux maxima occur where the potential gradient is greatest around 135 and 225 lines 4 and 6 where the cathode is nearest to the adjacent anode the global minimum was located furthest from the two adjacent anodes where the cathode was closest to the shell of the fcdi in this region the ion flux was near zero with the small potential gradient becoming the limiting factor as ion concentrations were relatively high and near that of the feed concentration figure 5 given the manner in which ion flux and potential gradient near the iem surface are closely linked when there is ample salt to be removed the potential gradient is the determining factor for ion flux this is evident from the occurrence of the peaks near lines 4 and 6 regardless of the height of the plane nonetheless the influence of ion concentration on ion flux is substantial as the differences in ion concentration caused by the local flow conditions have caused the peaks in na flux around 225 to be comparatively lower than around 135 even though the potential gradients are identical for example for plane 1 the local maxima are 1 61 10 6 kg m 2 s 1 and 1 43 10 6 kg m 2 s 1 for 135 and 225 respectively with the equivalent potential gradient of 3 18 101 v m 1 the reason for this disparity is therefore the difference in ion concentrations 4 77 10 4 kg kg 1 for 135 compared to 4 22 10 4 kg kg 1 for 225 which may be attributed to the hydraulic flow velocity 2 41 10 5 m s 1 for 135 is approximately three times 8 22 10 6 m s 1 for 225 further evidence of the influence of ion concentration can be found in the trend of decreasing salt flux with increasing height as the water travels upwards between the fcdi electrodes the ion concentrations of the streamlines near the iem surface decrease for further insight the ion flux as predicted by the cfd model for lines in the axial membrane direction around the circumference of the tubular cathode nearest the water inlet are plotted in figure 6 b in agreement with the results of figure 6 a the greatest ion fluxes along an entire line were located along line 4 and line 6 both adjacent to the nearest anodes line 4 had a 12 higher average na flux of 1 67 10 6 kg m 2 s 1 compared to 1 49 10 7 kg m 2 s 1 for line 6 with near identical potential fields across each gap as shown in figure 6 a the difference in ion flux is therefore due to the effect of the local ion concentration while the potential gradients vary between lines they were invariant along each line therefore the variations in na flux along any particular line can be attributed to the surface ion concentration as influenced by convection and the ion flux history of the streamline notably the highest na flux throughout the fcdi 2 67 10 6 kg m 2 s 1 occurred on line 4 near the water channel inlet which experienced a very high hydraulic flow velocity 3 05 10 3 m s 1 at the feed ion concentration this location simultaneously experiences the maximal potential as well as having an abundance of ions to transport which constitutes optimal conditions for ion removal the inlet flow also produced an elevated na flux for line 3 but to a lesser extent additionally along each line the general trend is that the na flux decreases with increasing height in the fcdi water channel as ions are gradually removed from the water channel however the ion flux trends upwards again approaching the water channel outlet as the streamlines converge and iem surface ion concentrations increase with a traditional fcdi design with narrow channels and parallel electrodes the salt removal performance has little spatial variation provided that the water and carbon channel flows are sustained and the water channel ion concentration is not prohibitively low in contrast the tubular electrodes of this present study produced non uniform hydraulic flows and electric fields throughout the water channel which resulted in varying ionic fluxes across the iem surface by using cfd to model flow velocity electrical potential and ion flux throughout the water channel of the fcdi with tubular electrodes a greater understanding of fcdi behavior has been attained optimal salt flux occurs in regions with high electric potential gradients that also experience high flow velocities for ion replenishment so designs that can simultaneously maximize both conditions should be developed 3 3 discussion an increase in the salt removal rate of an fcdi unit can be achieved by increasing the electrical current through the device provided that the fcdi has minimal electrical and hydraulic leakages high ce near 100 further examination of the experimental results indicates that while a higher current and asrr can be achieved with a higher voltage it is not energetically efficient to operate a fcdi with an excessively high voltage this is due to increased electrical resistances and faradaic reactions leading to a rapidly declining enrs when attempting to increase asrr by only increasing applied voltage figure 3 d therefore higher currents can be achieved by decreasing the electrical resistance in each element between the fcdi terminals or by increasing the effective electrode area once a design and materials have been selected producing a full scale fcdi unit becomes a task of increasing the effective area to reach the required production as a result of its large effective area compared to most other fcdi designs the 4 tube fcdi could achieve a relatively large current and therefore could remove more salt from the influent solution within a given period with an applied voltage of 1 25 v at the fcdi terminal the maximum salt removal rate was 0 25 mg s 1 this compares favorably against other fcdi studies commonly operating with an overall salt removal rate of under 0 1 mg s 1 with influent and flow electrode salinities of around 2000 mg l 1 as evident from the broad range of values reported in previous fcdi studies in table 2 the 4 tube fcdi possesses the second largest effective area of a single fcdi unit to date with the exception of that described by yang et al ref 10 in table 2 yang et al 2016b however the stack design of yang et al requires the fabrication of numerous graphite plates with machined flow channels with larger sizes required for further scale up manufacturing is likely to be expensive with a high rate of defects especially considering the fragile nature of large sheets of monolithic graphite with parallel carvings on both sides also the influent solution used in the study by yang et al was 35 g l 1 which greatly reduced the electrical resistance in the water channel and allowed for large current densities the novel fcdi design with tubular electrodes described here has achieved an order of magnitude increase in effective area compared to other lab scale studies with a design that avoids the need for milling of long tortuous channels in the current collector plates the fcdi with the next highest effective area 105 6 cm2 ref 1 in table 2 was about half that of the present study 202 3 cm2 cho et al 2017 the honeycomb fcdi unit developed by cho et al also employs a tubular flow electrode geometry which is testament to the ease of scalability of tubular designs with the exception of cho et al all other fcdi designs summarized in table 2 employ serpentine channels for their flow electrodes the methods used to fabricate serpentine channels vary including milled stainless steel milled graphite and laser cut channels with a graphite paper backing to achieve a high asrr a previous design by linnartz et al used a carbon fiber mesh current collector pressed onto the iem ref 8 in table 2 linnartz et al 2020 this has the effect of minimizing the electrical conduction losses through the flow electrode influencing the use of a current collector contacting the iem surface in the present study it is likely that hot pressing the current collector into the iem ensures improved contact compared to relying on the elasticity of the titanium mesh resulting in a superior asrr alternatively the addition of iem to increase the number of spacer channels between one pair of serpentine electrodes has been shown to increase the net salt removal and asrr ref 7 in table 2 ma et al 2020 however there are diminishing improvements with additional iem pairs as the system more resembles electrodialysis with the tubular fcdi design fabrication of the tubular iem and current collectors has been simplified and other components can be sourced from commercial tubular membrane modules or shell and tube heat exchangers allowing for further scale up to be achieved construction of a tubular fcdi consists of the iem titanium mesh and titanium wire as active components as well as structural components such as the shell and endplates for the active components the cost of the flat sheet iem was approximately us 400 per square meter the titanium mesh us 100 per square meter and titanium wire us 50 per kilogram for the current collector the per area cost of the titanium mesh is comparable to the cost of a graphite plate although the graphite plate requires serpentine channels to be milled furthermore for a conventional serpentine fcdi design the utilization of the iem and graphite is around 50 due to the presence of the channel walls whereas its around 80 for the helically wound tubular fcdi design due to the overlapping region glue prevents ion transport with alternative methods to construct tubular iem such as casting or coating the overlapping region can be eliminated and the entire iem area can be effective the cost of hydraulic fittings piping and electrical connections titanium wire and structural components are likely to have a similar cost to other fcdi designs for the tubular fcdi prototype the effective area of 202 3 cm2 was enclosed in a 289 0 cm3 volume 0 70 cm 1 effective area to volume ratio exclusive of the flow divider above the active region and the carbon suspension reservoir considering the prototype asrr of 0 43 1 08 μmol cm 2 min 1 this translates to a volumetric salt removal rate of 18 45 mol m 3 h 1 however this considers the whole fcdi prototype water channel including the non optimal regions with the electrodes facing the inert outer shell which have reduced effectiveness for salt removal the unit cell for the tubular fcdi consists of the square prism bounded by the planes joining the central axes of the 4 tubular electrodes which has an effective area to volume ratio of 1 72 cm 1 this ratio can be increased by changing the cross sectional profile of the electrodes decreasing the tube dimensions or minimizing the gap between adjacent electrodes by using the fcdi cfd model to compare the na and cl ion flux over the entire effective area and the ion flux for the unit cell region the asrr for the unit cell is estimated to be 0 72 1 82 μmol cm 2 min 1 corresponding to a volumetric salt removal rate of 30 76 mol m 3 h 1 during operation the ion concentrations at the iem surfaces facing the carbon channels are expected to be higher than at the side facing the water channel due to the depletion of ions in the water channel and ion accumulation in the carbon channels thus diffusion would act against the electrically driven ion transport which causes the overall experimental salt flux to decrease diffusion across iem are commonly included in mcdi and fcdi numerical models dykstra et al 2016 rommerskirchen et al 2018b wang and lin 2019 wang et al 2020 although the present cfd model is limited to the flow channel and does not consider the surface ion concentration on the flow electrode side of the iem back diffusion could be implemented in the cfd model provided that ion concentrations in the flow electrode chambers are also taken into account the model may also be improved by using different constants for the anode and cathode chambers to reflect the different transport rates of different species through the relevant iem although this would require extra information beyond only the outlet concentration to calibrate the cfd model given the novel fcdi design with tubular electrodes the use of cfd has also provided insight into how the unique geometry of the fcdi system affects ion transport the cfd model has satisfactorily predicted the salt removal performance of the 4 tube fcdi unit operating with flow rates between 23 5 39 1 ml min 1 and current densities between 9 89 17 3 a m 2 as evident from figure 4 and table 1 this model represents the first three dimensional model for fcdi technologies rommerskirchen et al 2018b wang et al 2020 and can be applied to any geometry of water channel which would allow for the performance of fcdi designs of any size to be estimated given the varying distance between electrodes and the unusual hydraulic conditions existing numerical models were unable to be employed to predict the fcdi performance cfd modelling for fcdi has helped identify the narrow gap between adjacent electrodes as an area of interest with the high potential gradient contributing greatly to salt removal conversely the sides of a tubular electrode without an opposing electrode adjacent to it experience near zero salt removal the current 4 tube design has only 2 anodes adjacent to each cathode with a larger rectangular array each interior cathode would have 4 anodes around it and the minimum ion flux 0 360 in figure 6 a would be eliminated and replaced by two peaks centered around 45 and 315 substantially increasing the total ion flux of each electrode and likewise for the anodes this method of scale up would likely benefit from both increased effective area and the decrease in sub optimal performance from a lower proportion of exterior electrodes in contrast cfd modelling has also identified the hydraulic constriction of the narrow gaps between electrodes as having the potential to decrease flow velocities leading to a local depletion of ions and subsequently a decreased ion flux the dimensions chosen for the tubular fcdi prototype were largely determined by ease of construction concerns and have not been optimized for desalination performance narrower tubes could allow an increase in packing density effective area to volume ratio although the more extreme angle of the helically wound ion exchange membrane that would be required creates construction challenges at least for the manual approach used in this work additionally use of narrower ribbons would result in an increase in the inactive overlapped area considering the fixed overlap width required to ensure a watertight seal these concerns can be resolved by fabricating tubular iem using casting or coating methods which are more amenable to mass production the circular cross section was chosen due to its ease of winding and ability to ensure that the current collector could expand around the inner circumference of the iem tube however this is not optimal for performance as the curvature of the tubular electrodes results in the region with the minimum spacer distance being quite small with a square cross section this region would be increased to encompass the whole side length although square tubes may be more difficult to construct additionally hydraulic flow between the electrodes may be compromised with a more restrictive and angular geometry at this early stage the current tubular fcdi prototype has not been optimized and there are numerous variables to be explored including the electrode shape spacing and dimensions even though we have not optimized the design in the current study we have introduced the concept and shown the feasibility of a tubular design and developed a tool i e a cfd model describing fluid and ion dynamics in the water channel that will aid in assessing the likely performance of alternate designs as cfd modelling can be applied to any fcdi geometry with a similar electrode arrangement current collector on the inner surface of the iem the desalination performance of a potential design can be evaluated prior to the construction of a functional prototype there is no doubt that cfd modelling will be more time and cost effective for the evaluation of possible geometries and operating conditions than construction of physical models indeed we expect to see increasing use of such coupled fluid and ion transport models in future with that presented here just a start to development in this rapidly growing area 4 conclusions an alternative design specifically tailored for fcdi module scale up has been developed here through the use of tubular electrodes tubular electrodes with the current collector on the surface of the iem provide a large effective area as the entirety of the iem area is available for salt removal while the energy performance is on par with other laboratory scale fcdi studies up to 13 8 μmol j 1 at 0 71 v the per unit area salt removal performance 1 08 μmol cm 2 min 1 at 1 96 v is mediocre nonetheless the large effective area 202 3 cm2 has resulted in a high net salt removal rate 140 μmol min 1 a 3d cfd model has been created and validated against experimental data to predict performance of the constructed fcdi unit the model can be applied to fcdi units of any shape and size allowing for regions of interest to be identified the narrow gaps between adjacent tubular electrodes are responsible for the greatest salt removal although low flow velocities can limit their effectiveness with possible future improvements being larger electrode arrays and modifications to the flow in the water channel the cfd model developed in this study therefore represents a useful design tool to aid future fcdi designs declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements we

16689,a novel design for a flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi system consisting of tubular electrodes in a shell and tube heat exchanger configuration is proposed each electrode consists of a metallic mesh current collector along the inner circumference of a tubular ion exchange membrane this tubular fcdi design is suitable for scale up as it consists of easily manufactured components which can be assembled in an array an apparatus with 4 tubular electrodes with a large effective area 202 3 cm2 was constructed and shown to provide a high net salt nacl removal rate 0 15 mg s 1 at 1 2 v applied voltage and 2000 mg l 1 influent total dissolved solids concentration a computational fluid dynamics cfd model incorporating ion migration and transport mechanisms was developed to simulate the ion concentration and electrical potential profiles in the water channel the results of cfd modelling highlighted the need to maximize regions of both high potential gradient and high hydraulic flow in order to achieve optimal salt removal in brief this study presents a new design approach for fcdi scale up and provides a computational tool for optimization of this design and future innovative fcdi designs graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is a class of technologies applicable to brackish water desalination via the removal of ionic contaminants through the application of an electrical potential across pairs of electrodes through which the feed stream passes in fixed electrode cdi ions are removed from the feed stream during the charging phase as a result of electrostatic migration and electrosorption anderson et al 2010 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 resulting in a decrease in the salinity of the product stream membrane capacitive deionization mcdi is a subclass of cdi where ion exchange membranes iem are placed on the surfaces of the electrodes to prevent adsorption of counter ions in the electrode discharge phase biesheuvel et al 2011 individual commercial mcdi modules capable of production rates of several cubic meters per day have been developed with units typically powered by mains supply given the low potential used to electrosorb ions and the dc current used mcdi units are well suited to being powered using photovoltaics and battery energy storage with the result that the technology is electrically compatible with off grid operation tan et al 2020 tan et al 2018 as mcdi operation involves cycling between charging and discharging stages for each individual module it is a discontinuous process which can be difficult and costly to scale thus flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi with the solid carbon electrodes replaced by flowable carbon suspensions has been developed in recent years as a steady state cdi process ma et al 2019b yang et al 2017 as the charged carbon particles can be transported out of the water treatment reactor it is possible to regenerate the carbon external to the reactor allowing for continuous operation cho et al 2017 doornbusch et al 2016 gendel et al 2014 he et al 2018 ma et al 2019b rommerskirchen et al 2015 rommerskirchen et al 2018a yang et al 2016a yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b eliminating the need for switching between charging and discharging stages and the associated inefficiencies due to mixing solutions of different concentrations hawks et al 2018 the mobile nature of the electrodes also provides the ability to physically or chemically manipulate the flow electrodes during operation permitting enhanced removal and or recovery of targeted species zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2021 the original fcdi units consisted of narrow serpentine flow electrode channels milled into stainless steel plates which also act as the current collector gendel et al 2014 jeon et al 2013 with steel later substituted for graphite due to concerns regarding corrosion and difficulty of manufacture hatzell et al 2015 rommerskirchen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2016a more recently titanium and conductive carbon mesh have been employed as the current collector with the mesh placed on the iem surface allowing for simultaneous contact between the iem current collector and carbon particles with resultant highly effective charge transfer in the flow electrode linnartz et al 2020 yang et al 2019 in the conventional fcdi design with serpentine channels only the surface area of the narrow channels can be considered to be effective in imparting charge given typical limiting current densities 20 a m 2 laboratory scale fcdi units have generally been limited to operating at currents under 0 5 a ma et al 2018 ma et al 2020 rommerskirchen et al 2015 the exceptions are studies using seawater influent for which currents up to 10 5 a have been reported jeon et al 2014 yang et al 2016b the complexity of milling a single long and narrow channel into both sides of a graphite or stainless steel plate limits further scale up due to the technical difficulty and associated expense of the milling process new designs for fcdi electrodes with improved ease of fabrication and greater effective area are therefore needed tubular flow channels would seem particularly suitable as conduits for the carbon suspension flow of fcdi with the possibility that these flow channels could be constrained within tubular ion exchange membranes indeed tubular membranes have been widely used in conventional membrane separation processes particularly for feed streams with high turbidity or solids content as they are more resilient to fouling and clogging additionally tubular membranes are relatively easy to manufacture and since they represent the entire flow channel avoid the need for the graphite machining step as the design does not require guides for the carbon flow the entirety of the iem area of tubular fcdi electrodes can be exposed to both the electrode slurry and feed streams cylindrical electrodes also exhibit a greater effective area for a given reactor volume as demonstrated with electrochemical reactors percin et al 2020 arrays of tubular electrodes with alternating anode and cathode channels surrounded by the feed solution have already been demonstrated to be feasible for fcdi desalination while achieving a high effective area cho et al 2017 choo et al 2019 while the use of a tubular flow electrode design appears feasible there is considerable uncertainty regarding the flow distribution within the reactor and its effects on the ion distribution during steady state operation particularly in view of the relatively complex geometry of the water sheath between the tubular fcdi electrodes in the current research a tubular fcdi was designed and fabricated to evaluate its desalination performance with computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling of water and ion transport within the unit used to strengthen our understanding of the impact of design and operational variables on system performance mechanistic models have been previously developed to predict fcdi performance however these studies have all been limited to planar fcdi geometries with a one dimensional spacer channel rommerskirchen et al 2018b wang et al 2020 computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation was used in this work to investigate the interrelationship among the hydraulic behavior electrical potential field and ion mass transport in the fcdi water channel cfd has been previously used in simulating flow patterns in reverse electrodialysis red gurreri et al 2014 2016 la cerva et al 2017 pawlowski et al 2016 and m cdi modules jeon et al 2017 kwon and rhim 2016 liu and wang 2021 mostly focusing on promoting hydraulic mixing cfd models in these studies often assume a constant ion flux proportional to the current density which is valid for the planar iems but is not appropriate for the proposed tubular fcdi geometry as the geometry between the electrodes of the tubular fcdi design will result in a non uniform electrical potential field the ion flux over the iem surface will be also non uniform necessitating an alternative simulation method for describing the ion flux in this study a novel cfd modelling method is developed to predict ion flux based on the electrical potential gradient and ion concentration on the surface of the iem at each node the model developed here is focused on the water channel of the tubular fcdi module with an assumption of constant potential and ion concentration boundary conditions in the carbon flow channel 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction 2 1 1 tubular iem the tubular iems were produced from flat sheet iems anion exchange membrane aem aem type ii fujifilm europe cation exchange membrane cem cem type ii fujifilm europe ribbons of iem measuring 500 mm x 25 mm were cut and then wound around a cylindrical rod of 14 mm diameter with a 2 mm overlap along the long edge figure 1 c an adhesive epoxy resin selleys araldite super strength was applied along the entirety of the overlap in a thin layer the adhesive was left to set before the iem tube was removed from the rod and trimmed to rectangular ends figure s1 a the tubular iems were left in their dry state as assembly required further use of adhesive 2 1 2 current collectors for the current collectors a titanium mesh adjacent to the iem was employed inspired by the titanium mesh membrane assembly design used by yang et al yang et al 2019 for each current collector a 1 mm diameter titanium wire was secured to a 240 mm x 50 mm sheet of titanium mesh anping hebei hongyun metal product co ltd the mesh represents the active current collector with the wire extending from the current collector allowing for connection to the appropriate electrical terminal 2 1 3 assembly the iem tubes were glued to holes on the upper and lower endplates and joined to the outer casing ensuring a watertight seal the holes were arranged in a square array with spacings of 2 mm between holes representing the minimum gap between adjacent electrodes for the passage of the influent solution each rectangular titanium mesh was wound around a cylindrical rod inserted into the tubular iem and then released allowing the current collector to expand and fit evenly around the inner circumference of the iem as depicted in figure 1 c and figure s1 b between the endplates the exposed length of each tubular electrode was 230 mm with 4 tubes the total effective area was 202 3 cm2 2 2 experimental method the pumping of the solution in the influent channel outside shell and the flow electrode suspension inside tube was accomplished using separate peristaltic pump heads longerpump bt100 1l a dc power supply powertech mp3840 was connected to the electrode terminals of the fcdi unit to supply the necessary electrical power for fcdi desalination a data logger sensordaq vernier along with attachments to measure potential difference vp bta vernier current dcp bta vernier and ionic conductivity con bta vernier was used to record the experimental data the influent solution used was 2000 mg l 1 nacl prepared using 18 2 mω cm 1 milli q water millipore and nacl solute sigma aldrich acs reagent 99 0 the influent solution was pumped upwards through the water sheath in a single pass configuration the influent solution was pumped through the apparatus at various flow rates 23 5 31 3 39 1 0 4 ml min 1 with the conductivity probe used to provide a continuous measure of the salinity of the product stream the flow electrode suspension used was 10 w w darco activated carbon sigma aldrich 100 mesh powder in 2000 mg l 1 nacl the 10 w w mass loading used here represents a moderate loading that has been shown to provide reasonably high performance ma et al 2018 without being excessively viscous as is the case with 20 w w hatzell et al 2017 carbon mass consisted of only commercially available darco activated carbon powder with no conductive additives e g carbon black liang et al 2017 ma et al 2019a with this composition chosen as a benchmark for minimum performance with the 4 tube fcdi in a vertical orientation figure s1 c the carbon suspension entered at the top via a single nozzle with the carbon suspension splashing and trickling down the inner walls of the flow electrodes at the bottom the carbon suspension dropped through the air gap into the reservoir and was subsequently pumped back to the top of the fcdi at a rate of 313 3 ml min 1 the total batch volume of the carbon suspension was 1 0 l we attempted to induce parallel flow in previous prototypes by construction of multiple tubular electrodes connected in parallel although these attempts were unsuccessful due to the inability to maintain consistent carbon flow through all electrodes with any variation in the flow rate between channels carbon settling and the increased hydraulic resistance along one channel will eventually result in zero carbon suspension flow through that channel as the bulk of the flow takes the path of least resistance eventually as individual channels become sequentially blocked the carbon flow only occurs in one channel and other channels begin to saturate with top to bottom carbon flow gravity acts to promote carbon flow and the settling does not result in blockages the design of the fcdi with tubular electrodes was such that the carbon suspension is regenerated by charge neutralization through physical contact of the oppositely charged flow electrodes a method referred to as short circuited closed cycled scc operation he et al 2018 yang et al 2017 the flow anode and flow cathode from each tubular electrode were combined into a single body at the reservoir with the suspension then passing through a peristaltic pump to promote mixing before being reintroduced into the fcdi reactor scc operation is intended to allow for continuous and steady state fcdi desalination with a single fcdi reactor the electrodes were charged with the application of a constant current cc using the dc power supply the applied current ranged between 0 15 0 35 a at the terminals of the fcdi average current density 7 4 17 3 a m 2 provided that the potential difference at the terminals did not exceed 2 0 v extended operation above 2 0 v was not carried out as water dissociation and corrosion of the titanium current collector were expected to occur the potential difference across and current through the fcdi terminals were measured during operation 2 3 computational fluid dynamics modelling cfd simulation was used to investigate the transport of ionic species in the water channel inside of the tubular fcdi module under the combined effect of convection diffusion and electrical potential forces 2 3 1 governing equations the governing equations for the fluid domain are the continuity equation conservation of mass represented as 1 ρ t ρ v 0 and the momentum equation represented as 2 t ρ v ρ v v p σ where ρ is the volume averaged density v is the flow velocity p is the static pressure and σ is the stress tensor the mass transfer of salt species i e na and cl was simulated by considering the effect of convection diffusion and ion migration under an electrical potential field 3 t ρ y i ρ v y i ρ d i y i s m i where y i represents the mass fraction of the ith ions and d i is the diffusion coefficient of the ith ions with d i set to 1 33 10 9 m2 s 1 and 2 03 10 9 m2 s 1 for na and cl respectively as the fcdi operation was tested under constant room temperature the thermal diffusion of salt was neglected s m i represents the source term for the ith ion which is used to induce ion transfer at the surfaces of the iem in the fcdi model the mass transfer of ions was modelled using the mass jump method developed in a previous study of membrane desalination processes lian et al 2016 through a user developed function udf code the na and cl ions are removed from the boundary layer cell directly adjacent to the cation exchange membrane cem and the anion exchange membrane aem respectively the source term s m i can therefore be written as 4 s m i j i a c v c for iem surface cells 0 for other cells where a c m2 and v c m3 are the cross sectional area and volume for each boundary layer cell respectively the nernst planck equation has been widely used in predicting ion flux through iems in mechanistic models of cdi and fcdi dykstra et al 2016 rommerskirchen et al 2018b wang and lin 2019 wang et al 2020 the nernst planck equation allows for the implementation of ion transport through diffusion and electromigration mechanisms as follows 5 j i n p d i c i x z i c i ϕ x where j i n p is the ion flux mol m 2 s 1 as predicted by the nernst planck equation d i is the ion diffusion coefficient m2 s 1 z i is the ion valence c i is the ion concentration mol m 3 and ϕ is the dimensionless potential several assumptions were made in the implementation of the ion flux equation in the cfd model firstly a constant electrical potential and ion concentration was assumed for the carbon flow channel of the tubular iem secondly ion mass diffusion across the iem was neglected as the ion concentration differences between the carbon channels and the water channel are low zhang et al 2020 thirdly the ionic conductivity was assumed to be a constant 0 36 s m 1 throughout the spacer channel finally with only na and cl ions present in the system z i takes the value of one therefore the above equation simplifies to 6 j i c f d k i c i m e m v m e m where j i c f d kg m 2 s 1 is the ion flux predicted by cfd simulation at each node k i is the ion mass transfer coefficient of each ion calculated based on their ion diffusion coefficient in water using the subsequent equations c i m e m is the ion concentration kg kg 1 of the relevant ion species adjacent to the iem surface and v m e m is the potential gradient v m 1 over first layer of simulation cells that are adjacent to the iem surface ion concentrations and potential gradients are calculated at each node on the first layer cell adjacent to the anodes and cathodes resulting in a spatially varying ion flux across the electrode boundaries the ion mass transfer coefficient k i kg m 1 s 1 v 1 was calculated from the ion diffusion coefficient d i m2 s 1 by 7 k i d i ρ n a c l v t 8 v t r t f where v t v is the thermal voltage for t 300 k with the gas constant r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and faraday s constant f 96485 c mol 1 d i are 1 33 10 9 m2 s 1 and 2 03 10 9 m2 s 1 for the sodium ion and chloride ion respectively and ρ n a c l 2130 kg m 3 for each set of operating conditions matching the experimental pumping rate and steady state current the cfd model generated hydraulic ion concentration and electrical potential distributions in the fcdi module at steady state operation to calibrate the cfd model the experimental steady state electrode voltages were multiplied by a reduction factor α constant for all operating conditions as a model fitting parameter according to previous fcdi modelling work by wang et al the potential difference across the spacer channel is approximately 10 of the applied potential difference after accounting for electrical electrode membrane and donnan resistances wang et al 2020 the reduced potential difference was employed in the udf to calculate salt flux and in the spacer channel to compute electrostatic ion transport 2 3 2 model geometry and simulation setup all simulations were carried out using ansys fluent version 2019r3 a three dimensional fluid domain with two pairs of iem tubes was built to represent the feed water channel of the previously described fcdi module a sweep method where a surface mesh was extended with defined spacing to represent any arbitrary cross section was used to achieve a unified mesh size 1 1 10 3 m along the axial direction of the membrane adjacent to the iem surfaces 5 layers of grid inflations with a first layer thickness of 2 5 10 5 m were applied at the liquid membrane interfaces ensuring the zones where electrical potential concentration polarization and transport phenomena occur were simulated using a higher mesh resolution a grid size of 3 10 4 m was employed across the remainder of the membrane bundle laminar flow conditions were used to calculate fluid flow in the water channel cfd simulation shows that the average reynolds number in the flow channel is around 1 2 and the maximum is 84 5 which are within the laminar flow regime the mass flowrate of the water inlet was set based on the pump flow rate during experimental operation 23 5 31 3 39 1 ml min 1 of 2000 mg l 1 nacl i e mass fractions of 787 and 1213 mg l 1 for na and cl respectively these flow rates correspond to flow velocities of 0 0553 0 0738 0 0922 m s 1 at the inlet all iem and structural walls of the water sheath were set as no slip boundary conditions the electromigration of ions under an applied electrical field is accounted for using the electrolyte model in ansys fluent all simulations were performed using the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm for pressure velocity coupling and the second order upwind algorithm for discretization of the conservation equations a convergence level below 10 6 was achieved for the potential residual and below 10 5 for all other terms mesh independence was verified by varying the number of divisions 100 200 300 400 along the axial direction of the tubular fcdi the delta concentration values at steady state operation for cell sizes of 2 2 1 1 0 73 0 55 mm are presented in figure s2 showing only a 1 4 range a unified mesh size of 1 1 10 3 m was selected and all modelling results presented are based on this axial mesh size 2 4 standard performance metrics the standard metrics for fcdi desalination performance as described by he et al and ma et al were calculated from the experimental results to describe electrical efficiency desalination rate and energy consumption and to aid comparison with other studies he et al 2018 ma et al 2018 the coulombic efficiency ce the ratio of charge of ions removed to electrical charge input the average salt removal rate asrr µmol cm 2 min 1 the rate of salt removal per unit area per unit time and the energy normalized salt removal enrs µmol j 1 a measure of the amount of salt removed per input of electrical energy were calculated as follows ce total charge of ions removed total charge supplied to

sodium chloride q is the feed solution flow rate i is the applied current v is the applied voltage a e f f is the effective area and t is the elapsed time the ion concentration at the surface of the fcdi electrodes as predicted by the cfd model was evaluated using concentration polarization indices cpi as defined by bhattacharya and hwang with the equation cpi ion concentration at membrane surface ion concentration in the bulk feed c m x c 0 where c m x is the ion concentration of a specific finite element at the membrane surface and c 0 is the ion concentration of the feed solution bhattacharya and hwang 1997 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results an fcdi apparatus with 4 tubular electrodes was constructed and operated demonstrating successful desalination as evident from figure 2 the application of a potential difference to the terminals of the fcdi unit resulted in the passage of current and proportional removal of salt from the 2000 mg l 1 nacl influent solution scc fcdi operation is intended to result in a temporally steady cell voltage for a constant applied current doornbusch et al 2016 he et al 2018 yang et al 2017 given the stability of the measured terminal voltage over each 1200 s period once steady state operation was attained figure 2 a the flow electrodes for the 4 tube fcdi were adequately regenerated during operation so electrosorption was not limited by the electrosorption capacity of the carbon particles the following performance data for the tubular fcdi unit is presented for steady state operation and was collected 600 1800 s after each change in current the 600 s delay prior to data collection accounting for the delay before the resumption of steady state conditions for the product stream concentration and the potential difference across the fcdi for a particular influent flow rate the application of a higher current resulted in a lower ion concentration in the product stream as evident from figure 2 c this is due to more ions being removed as evident from the graph of ion removal rate against the applied current shown in figure 2 d the highest average rate of ion removal achieved was 0 212 0 001 mg s 1 with the 4 tube fcdi operating at a flow rate of 39 1 ml min 1 and an applied current of 0 35 a given that the performance for all flow rates and applied currents lies near the line of charge equivalence figure 2 d the input of electrical charge has resulted in the equivalent removal of ions which indicates that the fcdi unit is operating at close to ideal electrical performance for the present design for operation with all applied currents and influent flow rates the ce for the 4 tube fcdi was consistently observed to be over 92 figure 3 a with a high near unity ce the input of a greater amount of electrical charge will result in proportionally more desalination this was also reflected in figure 2 d with the net rate of salt removal approximately equivalent to the current being supplied to the fcdi on an equivalent charge basis as represented by the line of ideal ce the asrr of the 4 tube fcdi was observed to be between 0 43 1 08 μmol cm 2 min 1 figure 3 b with an applied voltage of up to 2 0 v and an influent solution of 2000 mg l 1 nacl as is to be expected from operation with a consistent ce the asrr increases with increasing voltage due to the higher current and therefore current density passing through the fcdi unit the highest asrr of 1 08 0 01 μmol cm 2 min 1 was achieved with a flow rate of 39 1 ml min 1 and an applied current of 0 35 a average current density 17 3 a m 2 this result is lower than several previous studies in which small scale fcdi units with tortuous channels have been observed to operate at asrr in excess of 2 0 μmol cm 2 min 1 e g 2 25 μmol cm 2 min 1 ma et al 2020 however the advantage of the 4 tube fcdi is the significantly larger effective area of 202 3 cm2 compared to less than 60 cm2 for most other studies which translates to several times greater net salt removal rate e g 0 21 mg s 1 with the 4 tube fcdi vs 0 03 mg s 1 for ma et al with an effective area of only 11 9 cm2 the enrs was observed to be between 4 9 13 9 μmol j 1 figure 3 c which is a similar range to that reported in other fcdi studies for operation in the range of 0 7 2 0 v the energy consumption of the 4 tube fcdi is reasonable with energy not being excessively wasted the enrs decreased with larger applied voltages across the terminals of the 4 tube fcdi corresponding with the general trend of fcdi technologies being less energy efficient at higher operating voltages a plot of enrs vs asrr is presented in figure 3 d and provides a useful overview of the overall desalination and energy performance of the tubular fcdi unit as suggested by hawks et al hawks et al 2019 a plot of energy consumption kwh m 3 vs productivity l h 1 m 2 is also provided in figure s3 for comparison with other cdi architectures 3 2 computational fluid dynamics modelling 3 2 1 model validation to calibrate the cfd model the voltage reduction factor α was determined to be 0 28 from experimental results when operating with various single pass flow rates and applied currents figure 4 the range of potential differences across the spacer channel was therefore 0 26 0 55 v as presented in table 1 the percentage differences between the outlet concentration as obtained by the cfd model and by experimental means are generally below 10 with this good agreement validating the cfd model under the tested operating conditions 3 2 2 simulation results contour plots for flow velocity electrical potential and na and cl ion concentrations from the cfd modelling are presented in figure 5 the greatest potential gradients occur around the narrowest points between two adjacent oppositely charged electrodes figure 5 b the model predicts a potential gradient of around 3 2 101 v m 1 at the closest points between adjacent electrodes whereas the lowest potential gradients approximately 3 3 10 2 v m 1 are located nearest to the outer shell wall with three orders of magnitude variation in the potential gradient the ion flux through each electrode is expected to be heavily impacted by spatial factors as for the hydraulic flow in the water channel the 2 mm gap between adjacent tubular electrodes represents a constriction leading to an increased hydraulic resistance and a lower flow for the cross section midway along the height of the tubular fcdi unit figure 5 a the midpoint of the gap along the plane with the inlet and outlet line 1 1 registered a flow velocity of 7 3 10 4 m s 1 whereas the transverse plane line 2 2 experienced an even lower flow velocity of only 3 9 10 4 m s 1 with na sinks at the negative cathodes and cl sinks at the positive anodes the local ion concentration decreases especially at the regions of high electrical potential gradient and low hydraulic flow velocity it is possible that localized depletion of ions may occur due to the low ion conduction rate resulting from the low local flowrate which would result in a lower overall ion removal rate the feed na and cl concentrations were 787 and 1213 mg l 1 amounting to the nacl concentration of the 2000 mg l 1 in the feed solution for all cases as shown in figure 5 c d the minimum ion concentrations at the relevant electrodes as predicted by the cfd model was 267 mg l 1 for na at the cathode and 222 mg l 1 for cl at the anode therefore the cpi corresponding to the minima are 0 339 and 0 183 respectively for na and cl with a large deviation from unity representing a high degree of polarization bhattacharya and hwang 1997 as these indices are substantially below unity the ion removal rate is expected to be significantly diminished by the reasonably high degree of concentration polarization this is likely a determining factor for the steady state current and voltage of the fcdi unit as concentration polarization must be overcome by the supplied electrical energy nonetheless the cpi are within one order of magnitude of unity so ions are not extremely depleted at the membrane surfaces during steady state operation and ion removal can still occur concentration polarization can be reduced by promoting hydraulic flow on the surfaces of the electrodes which will result in a greater ion removal the influence of hydraulic flow and potential gradient can be observed in the cfd model predictions of ion flux around the circumference of a fcdi electrode figure 6 a presents the ion flux and potential gradient around the circumference of the cathode nearest the inlet at three heights the potential gradient profile varied minimally with height ion flux maxima occur where the potential gradient is greatest around 135 and 225 lines 4 and 6 where the cathode is nearest to the adjacent anode the global minimum was located furthest from the two adjacent anodes where the cathode was closest to the shell of the fcdi in this region the ion flux was near zero with the small potential gradient becoming the limiting factor as ion concentrations were relatively high and near that of the feed concentration figure 5 given the manner in which ion flux and potential gradient near the iem surface are closely linked when there is ample salt to be removed the potential gradient is the determining factor for ion flux this is evident from the occurrence of the peaks near lines 4 and 6 regardless of the height of the plane nonetheless the influence of ion concentration on ion flux is substantial as the differences in ion concentration caused by the local flow conditions have caused the peaks in na flux around 225 to be comparatively lower than around 135 even though the potential gradients are identical for example for plane 1 the local maxima are 1 61 10 6 kg m 2 s 1 and 1 43 10 6 kg m 2 s 1 for 135 and 225 respectively with the equivalent potential gradient of 3 18 101 v m 1 the reason for this disparity is therefore the difference in ion concentrations 4 77 10 4 kg kg 1 for 135 compared to 4 22 10 4 kg kg 1 for 225 which may be attributed to the hydraulic flow velocity 2 41 10 5 m s 1 for 135 is approximately three times 8 22 10 6 m s 1 for 225 further evidence of the influence of ion concentration can be found in the trend of decreasing salt flux with increasing height as the water travels upwards between the fcdi electrodes the ion concentrations of the streamlines near the iem surface decrease for further insight the ion flux as predicted by the cfd model for lines in the axial membrane direction around the circumference of the tubular cathode nearest the water inlet are plotted in figure 6 b in agreement with the results of figure 6 a the greatest ion fluxes along an entire line were located along line 4 and line 6 both adjacent to the nearest anodes line 4 had a 12 higher average na flux of 1 67 10 6 kg m 2 s 1 compared to 1 49 10 7 kg m 2 s 1 for line 6 with near identical potential fields across each gap as shown in figure 6 a the difference in ion flux is therefore due to the effect of the local ion concentration while the potential gradients vary between lines they were invariant along each line therefore the variations in na flux along any particular line can be attributed to the surface ion concentration as influenced by convection and the ion flux history of the streamline notably the highest na flux throughout the fcdi 2 67 10 6 kg m 2 s 1 occurred on line 4 near the water channel inlet which experienced a very high hydraulic flow velocity 3 05 10 3 m s 1 at the feed ion concentration this location simultaneously experiences the maximal potential as well as having an abundance of ions to transport which constitutes optimal conditions for ion removal the inlet flow also produced an elevated na flux for line 3 but to a lesser extent additionally along each line the general trend is that the na flux decreases with increasing height in the fcdi water channel as ions are gradually removed from the water channel however the ion flux trends upwards again approaching the water channel outlet as the streamlines converge and iem surface ion concentrations increase with a traditional fcdi design with narrow channels and parallel electrodes the salt removal performance has little spatial variation provided that the water and carbon channel flows are sustained and the water channel ion concentration is not prohibitively low in contrast the tubular electrodes of this present study produced non uniform hydraulic flows and electric fields throughout the water channel which resulted in varying ionic fluxes across the iem surface by using cfd to model flow velocity electrical potential and ion flux throughout the water channel of the fcdi with tubular electrodes a greater understanding of fcdi behavior has been attained optimal salt flux occurs in regions with high electric potential gradients that also experience high flow velocities for ion replenishment so designs that can simultaneously maximize both conditions should be developed 3 3 discussion an increase in the salt removal rate of an fcdi unit can be achieved by increasing the electrical current through the device provided that the fcdi has minimal electrical and hydraulic leakages high ce near 100 further examination of the experimental results indicates that while a higher current and asrr can be achieved with a higher voltage it is not energetically efficient to operate a fcdi with an excessively high voltage this is due to increased electrical resistances and faradaic reactions leading to a rapidly declining enrs when attempting to increase asrr by only increasing applied voltage figure 3 d therefore higher currents can be achieved by decreasing the electrical resistance in each element between the fcdi terminals or by increasing the effective electrode area once a design and materials have been selected producing a full scale fcdi unit becomes a task of increasing the effective area to reach the required production as a result of its large effective area compared to most other fcdi designs the 4 tube fcdi could achieve a relatively large current and therefore could remove more salt from the influent solution within a given period with an applied voltage of 1 25 v at the fcdi terminal the maximum salt removal rate was 0 25 mg s 1 this compares favorably against other fcdi studies commonly operating with an overall salt removal rate of under 0 1 mg s 1 with influent and flow electrode salinities of around 2000 mg l 1 as evident from the broad range of values reported in previous fcdi studies in table 2 the 4 tube fcdi possesses the second largest effective area of a single fcdi unit to date with the exception of that described by yang et al ref 10 in table 2 yang et al 2016b however the stack design of yang et al requires the fabrication of numerous graphite plates with machined flow channels with larger sizes required for further scale up manufacturing is likely to be expensive with a high rate of defects especially considering the fragile nature of large sheets of monolithic graphite with parallel carvings on both sides also the influent solution used in the study by yang et al was 35 g l 1 which greatly reduced the electrical resistance in the water channel and allowed for large current densities the novel fcdi design with tubular electrodes described here has achieved an order of magnitude increase in effective area compared to other lab scale studies with a design that avoids the need for milling of long tortuous channels in the current collector plates the fcdi with the next highest effective area 105 6 cm2 ref 1 in table 2 was about half that of the present study 202 3 cm2 cho et al 2017 the honeycomb fcdi unit developed by cho et al also employs a tubular flow electrode geometry which is testament to the ease of scalability of tubular designs with the exception of cho et al all other fcdi designs summarized in table 2 employ serpentine channels for their flow electrodes the methods used to fabricate serpentine channels vary including milled stainless steel milled graphite and laser cut channels with a graphite paper backing to achieve a high asrr a previous design by linnartz et al used a carbon fiber mesh current collector pressed onto the iem ref 8 in table 2 linnartz et al 2020 this has the effect of minimizing the electrical conduction losses through the flow electrode influencing the use of a current collector contacting the iem surface in the present study it is likely that hot pressing the current collector into the iem ensures improved contact compared to relying on the elasticity of the titanium mesh resulting in a superior asrr alternatively the addition of iem to increase the number of spacer channels between one pair of serpentine electrodes has been shown to increase the net salt removal and asrr ref 7 in table 2 ma et al 2020 however there are diminishing improvements with additional iem pairs as the system more resembles electrodialysis with the tubular fcdi design fabrication of the tubular iem and current collectors has been simplified and other components can be sourced from commercial tubular membrane modules or shell and tube heat exchangers allowing for further scale up to be achieved construction of a tubular fcdi consists of the iem titanium mesh and titanium wire as active components as well as structural components such as the shell and endplates for the active components the cost of the flat sheet iem was approximately us 400 per square meter the titanium mesh us 100 per square meter and titanium wire us 50 per kilogram for the current collector the per area cost of the titanium mesh is comparable to the cost of a graphite plate although the graphite plate requires serpentine channels to be milled furthermore for a conventional serpentine fcdi design the utilization of the iem and graphite is around 50 due to the presence of the channel walls whereas its around 80 for the helically wound tubular fcdi design due to the overlapping region glue prevents ion transport with alternative methods to construct tubular iem such as casting or coating the overlapping region can be eliminated and the entire iem area can be effective the cost of hydraulic fittings piping and electrical connections titanium wire and structural components are likely to have a similar cost to other fcdi designs for the tubular fcdi prototype the effective area of 202 3 cm2 was enclosed in a 289 0 cm3 volume 0 70 cm 1 effective area to volume ratio exclusive of the flow divider above the active region and the carbon suspension reservoir considering the prototype asrr of 0 43 1 08 μmol cm 2 min 1 this translates to a volumetric salt removal rate of 18 45 mol m 3 h 1 however this considers the whole fcdi prototype water channel including the non optimal regions with the electrodes facing the inert outer shell which have reduced effectiveness for salt removal the unit cell for the tubular fcdi consists of the square prism bounded by the planes joining the central axes of the 4 tubular electrodes which has an effective area to volume ratio of 1 72 cm 1 this ratio can be increased by changing the cross sectional profile of the electrodes decreasing the tube dimensions or minimizing the gap between adjacent electrodes by using the fcdi cfd model to compare the na and cl ion flux over the entire effective area and the ion flux for the unit cell region the asrr for the unit cell is estimated to be 0 72 1 82 μmol cm 2 min 1 corresponding to a volumetric salt removal rate of 30 76 mol m 3 h 1 during operation the ion concentrations at the iem surfaces facing the carbon channels are expected to be higher than at the side facing the water channel due to the depletion of ions in the water channel and ion accumulation in the carbon channels thus diffusion would act against the electrically driven ion transport which causes the overall experimental salt flux to decrease diffusion across iem are commonly included in mcdi and fcdi numerical models dykstra et al 2016 rommerskirchen et al 2018b wang and lin 2019 wang et al 2020 although the present cfd model is limited to the flow channel and does not consider the surface ion concentration on the flow electrode side of the iem back diffusion could be implemented in the cfd model provided that ion concentrations in the flow electrode chambers are also taken into account the model may also be improved by using different constants for the anode and cathode chambers to reflect the different transport rates of different species through the relevant iem although this would require extra information beyond only the outlet concentration to calibrate the cfd model given the novel fcdi design with tubular electrodes the use of cfd has also provided insight into how the unique geometry of the fcdi system affects ion transport the cfd model has satisfactorily predicted the salt removal performance of the 4 tube fcdi unit operating with flow rates between 23 5 39 1 ml min 1 and current densities between 9 89 17 3 a m 2 as evident from figure 4 and table 1 this model represents the first three dimensional model for fcdi technologies rommerskirchen et al 2018b wang et al 2020 and can be applied to any geometry of water channel which would allow for the performance of fcdi designs of any size to be estimated given the varying distance between electrodes and the unusual hydraulic conditions existing numerical models were unable to be employed to predict the fcdi performance cfd modelling for fcdi has helped identify the narrow gap between adjacent electrodes as an area of interest with the high potential gradient contributing greatly to salt removal conversely the sides of a tubular electrode without an opposing electrode adjacent to it experience near zero salt removal the current 4 tube design has only 2 anodes adjacent to each cathode with a larger rectangular array each interior cathode would have 4 anodes around it and the minimum ion flux 0 360 in figure 6 a would be eliminated and replaced by two peaks centered around 45 and 315 substantially increasing the total ion flux of each electrode and likewise for the anodes this method of scale up would likely benefit from both increased effective area and the decrease in sub optimal performance from a lower proportion of exterior electrodes in contrast cfd modelling has also identified the hydraulic constriction of the narrow gaps between electrodes as having the potential to decrease flow velocities leading to a local depletion of ions and subsequently a decreased ion flux the dimensions chosen for the tubular fcdi prototype were largely determined by ease of construction concerns and have not been optimized for desalination performance narrower tubes could allow an increase in packing density effective area to volume ratio although the more extreme angle of the helically wound ion exchange membrane that would be required creates construction challenges at least for the manual approach used in this work additionally use of narrower ribbons would result in an increase in the inactive overlapped area considering the fixed overlap width required to ensure a watertight seal these concerns can be resolved by fabricating tubular iem using casting or coating methods which are more amenable to mass production the circular cross section was chosen due to its ease of winding and ability to ensure that the current collector could expand around the inner circumference of the iem tube however this is not optimal for performance as the curvature of the tubular electrodes results in the region with the minimum spacer distance being quite small with a square cross section this region would be increased to encompass the whole side length although square tubes may be more difficult to construct additionally hydraulic flow between the electrodes may be compromised with a more restrictive and angular geometry at this early stage the current tubular fcdi prototype has not been optimized and there are numerous variables to be explored including the electrode shape spacing and dimensions even though we have not optimized the design in the current study we have introduced the concept and shown the feasibility of a tubular design and developed a tool i e a cfd model describing fluid and ion dynamics in the water channel that will aid in assessing the likely performance of alternate designs as cfd modelling can be applied to any fcdi geometry with a similar electrode arrangement current collector on the inner surface of the iem the desalination performance of a potential design can be evaluated prior to the construction of a functional prototype there is no doubt that cfd modelling will be more time and cost effective for the evaluation of possible geometries and operating conditions than construction of physical models indeed we expect to see increasing use of such coupled fluid and ion transport models in future with that presented here just a start to development in this rapidly growing area 4 conclusions an alternative design specifically tailored for fcdi module scale up has been developed here through the use of tubular electrodes tubular electrodes with the current collector on the surface of the iem provide a large effective area as the entirety of the iem area is available for salt removal while the energy performance is on par with other laboratory scale fcdi studies up to 13 8 μmol j 1 at 0 71 v the per unit area salt removal performance 1 08 μmol cm 2 min 1 at 1 96 v is mediocre nonetheless the large effective area 202 3 cm2 has resulted in a high net salt removal rate 140 μmol min 1 a 3d cfd model has been created and validated against experimental data to predict performance of the constructed fcdi unit the model can be applied to fcdi units of any shape and size allowing for regions of interest to be identified the narrow gaps between adjacent tubular electrodes are responsible for the greatest salt removal although low flow velocities can limit their effectiveness with possible future improvements being larger electrode arrays and modifications to the flow in the water channel the cfd model developed in this study therefore represents a useful design tool to aid future fcdi designs declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements we
