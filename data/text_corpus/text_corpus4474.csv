verified by applying a ship s stiffened panel as an applied example in particular a refined empirical formulation in predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened panel subjected to longitudinal compression was proposed recently kim et al 2017 observed that the ultimate strength behaviours fluctuated in small value of column slenderness ratio and urged the need for a more accurate empirical formulation in order for an accurate ultimate strength behaviour of stiffened panel to be obtained a total of 10 500 cases of numerical simulation results using the ansys finite element method fem

in many industrial fields such as information technology it manufacturing and many others driven by data fig 1 depicts a summary of data utilisation procedure including collection processing and optimisation samsung 2017 the importance of the data has highlighted and the following quote can be considered as one of the best examples by amazon s ceo that all the decisions are required to be made by measurable data for purpose of data collection various technologies were considered particularly internet of things iot or internet of everything ioe which produces data from the interaction between 1 things and things 2 human and human or 3 things and human clouding system has been widely used to collect data nowadays this technology has enabled for the collection of big data therefore requiring an advanced approach towards data processing there are mainly two 2 ways of processing data the conventional probabilistic approaches and advanced deep learning or neural network based approaches techniques wong and kim 2018 kim et al 2019b in the case of conventional technique it is capable of producing the outcome with empirical formulation shape or probabilistic approach by adopting the data optimisation technique advanced technique on the other hand refers to the utilisation of artificial intelligence such as machine learning and deep learning i e artificial neural network convolutional neural network etc in the present study the conventional technique was applied in developing the empirical formulation for predicting the ultimate strength of ship s t bar type stiffened panel subjected to longitudinal compression commonly probabilistic approaches and techniques have been developed and applied in various fields the technique proposed in this study may be considered as one of the conventional methods in the field of shipbuilding and offshore engineering simplified closed form shape equation or empirical formulation is still widely used in design guideline numerous studies have been conducted to develop the empirical formulations or simplified methods in predicting the ultimate strength of ships and offshore structures by considering intact and damaged conditions in particular hull girder caldwell 1965 paik and mansour 1995 paik et al 2012 2013 kim et al 2013a b 2014 2019a stiffened panel lin 1985 paik and thayamballi 1997 zhang and khan 2009 kim et al 2017 xu et al 2018 and un stiffened panel plate structures ueda et al 1975 carlsen 1977 ivanov and rousey 1979 soreide and czujko 1983 hughes 1983 dnv 1987 smith et al 1988 ueda et al 1992 cui and mansour 1998 paik et al 2004 kim et al 2018c have been the primary focus of several researchers in addition these types of closed form shape empirical formulations have been applied in predicting among others the time dependent damage environmental loading and fatigue performance of structure paik and kim 2012 mohd et al 2014 2019 kim et al 2018a seo et al 2018 recently a wide range of technical reviews on existing empirical formulations in predicting ultimate strength of plate were conducted and an advanced empirical formulation was also proposed by zhang 2015 in terms of stiffened panel kim et al 2018b conducted technical reviews on existing empirical formulations in predicting ultimate strength of stiffened panel including of steel and aluminium based structures moreover they provided statistical analysis results to evaluate the applicability of existing empirical formulations by comparing against the ansys nonlinear finite element method nlfem it was highlighted that the resultant ultimate limit state uls of the stiffened panel subjected to longitudinal compression tends to fluctuate in the lower range of the column slenderness ratio λ it therefore means that the resultant uls of stiffened panel is highly multivariate which cause highly nonlinear behaviour by various parameters as shown in fig 2 in these regards the necessity of a refined empirical formulation was raised by kim et al 2018b to represent these nonlinear behaviours rather than existing single line based empirical formulation in this study a data processing technique based on conventional approach was introduced to develop a refined empirical formulation in predicting the ultimate limit state of t bar stiffened panel subjected to longitudinal compression in the near future artificial neural network ann which is one of the deep learning techniques based prediction can also be introduced it means that the uls prediction by ann can be performed in order to check its applicability and accuracy 2 development of a refined empirical formulation in predicting uls of stiffened panels by conventional data processing technique the proposed procedure to develop empirical formulation is presented in fig 3 it can be classified into three major steps including 1 generation of input data 2 processing of data and 3 prediction of the results the proposed procedure conventional method in part i was verified by the applied example of stiffened panel it will in the end provide a refined empirical formulation in predicting ultimate limit state of stiffened panel subjected to longitudinal compression detailed steps of this technique is documented in this section 2 1 generation of input data from the previous study by kim et al 2018b shown in fig 2 it could be observed that ultimate strength of stiffened panel under longitudinal compression depicts the fluctuation behaviour in the relatively small value of column slenderness ratio λ this may be related to changes of the geometric properties of stiffened panel such as plate and stiffener the studies have conducted various numerical simulations with the resulting fe simulation outcomes being used as input data in the current study in summary the studies conducted 10 500 cases of numerical simulations applying the ansys nonlinear finite element method nlfem the selected scenarios are summarised in table 1 fig 2 plots the numerical simulation results of the 10 500 cases as shown in fig 2 geometry of stiffened panel can be represented by a combination of plate slenderness ratio β and column slenderness ratio λ in order to obtain the refined empirical formulation a detailed data processing technique needs to be applied from kim et al 2018b the input data were generated in accordance with the following steps 1 collection of the data 2 definition of detailed characteristics 3 selection of reliable scenarios and 4 calculation of ultimate strength represented in generating input data as shown in fig 3 details on input data may be referred to kim et al 2018b in the case of finite element modelling technique issc reports issc 2012 2015 may be referred to facilitate readers in obtaining a broader range of perspective and understanding of finite element modelling techniques and ultimate strength analysis procedures for plate stiffened panel and hull girders schematic view of stiffend panel applied boundary condition and initial deflection are presented in figs 4 5 and 6 respectively in brief two bays two span model ½ 1 ½ is adopted to take into account the effect of boundary region between the adjacent spans in the present study in addition longitudinal girders and transverse frames are replaced with a boundary condition that limits the displacement in the vertical direction z direction as zero in order to consider the effect of a continued stiffened panel a symmetric condition with rotation in the longitudinal x and vertical z directions were set as zero at the transverse edges while the symmetric condition with rotation in the transverse y and vertical z directions were set as zero at the longitudinal edges the shell element named shell 181 in ansys nlfem has been used with nearly 1 1 of element ratio between the plate length and breadth ten elements for plate were adopted between stiffeners while six and four elements were used for web height and flange breadth in the case of initial imperfections only initial distortion effect has been considered for plate and stiffeners in the present study while welding induced residual stress effect has not been considered in this study it is well known that three types of initial distortions such as plate initial deflection w o p l column type initial distortion of the stiffener w o c and sideways initial distortion of the stiffener w o s are generally considered for fe modelling of stiffened panel under longitudinal compression kim et al 2012a b among various types of initial deflection modes buckling mode is adopted to represent initial deflection of plate and stiffeners with average level as shown in eqs 1 1 to 1 3 details may be referred to issc report issc 2012 initial

the minimum integer satisfying a b m m 1 issc 2012 paik 2018 2 2 data processing 2 2 1 definition of the parameters assumption of the empirical formulation shape ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel was determined through a series of fe analysis as reflected in fig 2 the geometrical properties of stiffened panel i e plate thickness t p plate length a plate breadth b web height h w web thickness t w flange width b f and flange thickness t f caused the fluctuation in ultimate strength of stiffened panel therefore the fluctuation behaviour in ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel should be included and predicted by the refined empirical formulation from fig 2 it could be deduced that the single line shape empirical formulation may not be able to predict ultimate strength behaviour of stiffened panel although predictable by leveraging the polynomial function shape polynomial function represented in eq 2 is a combination of mathematical terms constructed with real number coefficients and nonnegative integer exponents eq 2 depicts a general shape of the polynomial function in which presents degree n as a function of the form the order of a polynomial defines the numbers of maximum and minimum points in the fitted function it allows a polynomial curve to have turning points as well as changing in slope to fit the data points besides that the polynomial equation would be able to contain one or more variables the variables in polynomial function will affect the slope changes in the data for instance possible factors that result in the fluctuation of ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel could be used as parameter in polynomial function to allow fluctuation of the predicted data 2 f x c 0 c 1 x c 2 x 2 c n 1 x n 1 c n x n where c real numbers or coefficients of the polynomial as shown in eq 3 plate slenderness ratio β and column slenderness ratio λ are vital parameters commonly applied in many existing empirical formulations as summarised in appendix a to predict ultimate strength of stiffened panel 3 σ x u σ y f β λ existing empirical formulations based on the combination of plate slenderness ratio and column slenderness ratio as presented in eq 3 were able to be compared with ansys nonlinear finite element method nlfem numerical simulations results as shown in fig 7 as would be expected the limitation of the existing empirical formulation found that single line shape function may not be capable of predicting the nonlinear fluctuation behaviour of ultimate strength of stiffened panel obtained by ansys nlfem on the other hand additional parameters need to be listed out for the development of a refined empirical formulation in predicting ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel sheikh et al 2002 proposed a set of dimensionless parameters β 1 to β 11 which influences the ultimate strength of stiffened panel as shown in table 2 for the additional parameters used in polynomial function dimensionless parameters proposed by sheikh et al 2002 were used in this study for the estimation of parameters furthermore additional dimensionless parameters were also suggested in this study to be used for parameter estimation based on the geometric parameter of stiffened panel as listed in table 3 2 2 2 transformation of the dimensionless parameters selected parameters could then be transformed into the form as shown in table 4 the original parameter p is transformed to many types of parameters among others including 1 p 1 p 2 p 2 p 1 p and ln p in this instance original parameter p was maintained in the list of transformed parameters so that all these listed transformed parameters can be applied as input data for the empirical formulation for example each parameter selected by the previous step as illustrated in tables 2 and 3 could be considered as the original parameter and after transformation following that of which the shape of the parameter transformed into that as shown in table 4 in this study only seven 7 typical shapes of transformation i e p 1 to p 7 as reflected in table 4 were considered additionally more shapes may be considered as well 2 2 3 generation of possible empirical formulation set for the generation of possible empirical formulation set general shape of the polynomial formula in eq 2 was recalled as depicted in eq 4 by assuming parameter p 4 f p c 0 c 1 p c 2 p 2 c n 1 p n 1 c n p n where c real numbers or coefficients of the polynomial from the given polynomial equation in eq 4 a number of scenarios could possibly be generated if more parameters of higher order were considered the empirical formulation may produce more accurate results however accuracy may be attained at the expense of its higher costs due to the complexity of the equation therefore requiring additional computational time as such the balance between efficiency and accuracy of the empirical formulation is a vital consideration in this study four parameters with 2nd order form was set as a limit to propose a refined empirical formulation for example general shapes of the four parameters with the limitation of 2nd order based equations are summarised in table 5 here ten basic shapes of the equations with applied examples are given for the selection of the best empirical formulation repeated processing is required in this study the obtained coefficient of determination r2 is 0 9 or above it is then considered as relevant equation to be proposed 2 3 selection of the best empirical formulation upon verification of the accuracy of the proposed empirical formulation the final shape of empirical formulation could then be suggested to be employed for end users based on the suggested polynomial equation in eq 4 and its applications in table 5 the best four parameters were decided based on the criteria of higher r2 values in order higher r2 value to be obtained a repetition of this loop is required afterwards the coefficient of the four parameters such as p 0 σ x u σ y p 1 λ p 2 β p 3 h w t w p 4 i p z i s z will be proposed as the empirical formulation p 0 here refers to the dependent parameter following eq 5 an empirical formulation shape was obtained to predict the ultimate strength of stiffened panel that was subjected to the longitudinal compression with higher coefficient of determination r2 0 98 the detailed fifteen coefficients i e c 0 to c 14 were also selected and presented in eq 5 table 6 summarizes the 15 coefficients c 0 to c 14 in this step it is recommended for the accuracy test to achieve r2 of 0 9 or more additional empirical formulation shape may then be considered should it not be applicable 5 σ x u σ y e q c 0 c 1 c 2 λ c 3 β c 4 h w t w c 5 i p z i s z λ c 6 c 7 β c 8 h w

finite element nlfem method kim et al 2018b in the similar shape ultimate strength results by proposed empirical formulation in eq 5 were also plotted in fig 8 once again figs 2 and 8 depicted the resulting ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel by ansys nlfem method and empirical formulation respectively as earlier mentioned the result of the proposed empirical formulation reflects positive agreement with ansys numerical simulation r2 0 98 to help readers understanding the appendix provides two additional examples of uls calculation by proposed empirical formulation in eq 5 in sum 10 500 cases of stiffened panels t bar only with seven 7 plate slenderness ratios i e β 0 7297 0 9991 1 5103 2 0295 2 3194 2 9620 and 3 4181 were employed to compare the ultimate strength results of ansys nlfem against the proposed empirical formulation the detailed comparison results were shown in fig 9 a g based on the given plate slenderness ratios the detailed r2 values based on each β were also verified by comparing the results in fig 9 it was confirmed that the proposed empirical formulation was able to produce well matched results based on the resulting r2 values as summarised in table 7 2 4 applicability test and the application of the development of refined empirical formulation the previous section verified the accuracy of the proposed empirical formulation furthermore the applicability of the proposed formulation was also investigated by the statistical analysis through the mean and coefficient of variation cov results as shown in fig 10 as expected the mean and cov values were close to 1 0 and 0 0 respectively in most cases of the plate slenderness ratio β this would infer that the proposed empirical formulation is applicable or replicable to the existing method in predicting the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel the applicability of the proposed empirical formulation was confirmed via the statistical analysis additionally the proposed equation should also be verified by typical scenarios of the stiffened panel in the event that the proposed empirical formulation was not able to accurately predict ultimate strength or a limitation of the range of stiffened panel s geometry was found in the given formulation which is a function of plate slenderness ratio β and column slenderness ratio λ then additional scenarios should be considered in this case 10 500 cases were considered to be a sufficient amount of input scenarios in order to avoid the applicability test in the final step the limitation of the proposed empirical formulation should be implemented in the case of the proposed empirical formulation in eq 5 the available range of the β and λ obtained by collected 10 500 stiffened panel scenarios shown in table 1 were represented in the shaded area with an equation as depicted in fig 11 this may be considered as a range of limitation of the proposed empirical formulation 3 discussion by comparison with other formulations recently kim et al 2018b has widely reviewed the existing empirical formulations in predicting ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels a number of numerical simulations 10 500 cases in total to be exact have also been conducted by ansys nonlinear finite element method based on the 10 500 cases of ansys results which were used as input data in the present study a refined empirical formulation was developed the ultimate strength results predicted by proposed empirical formulation of this study were compared against the existing methods such as design formulas euler perry robertson and johnson ostenfeld empirical formulations lin 1985 paik and thayamballi 1997 zhang and khan 2009 kim et al 2017 xu et al 2018 numerical simulation results by ansys and analytical solutions alps ulsap 2016 as shown in fig 12 for the comparison the same stiffened panel scenarios were adopted in fig 12 a to 12 g from the visualised outcomes of fig 12 single line shape empirical formulations or design formulations were observed to exhibit limitations in predicting the ultimate strength behaviour of the stiffened panel which kim et al 2018b had also highlighted this was the problem statement of this study in which necessitates a refined or advanced empirical formulation by adopting other more complex shapes of the formulation by assuming the polynomial equation shape it could predict better results than the existing methods this statement was supported by the statistical analysis results as shown in fig 13 a h and table a1 4 conclusions a useful data processing technique was introduced against the backdrop of the 4th industrial revolution in this paper a refined empirical formulation was developed to predict ultimate strength of t bar stiffened panel under longitudinal compression by conventional data processing technique it was found that stiffened panel had a higher geometric nonlinearity therefore concluding that a simplified or single line shape empirical formulation would not be relevant in representing the ultimate strength behaviour as a result the polynomial function based empirical formulation was proposed the outcome was also compared with existing formulations by statistical analysis as shown in table a1 and fig 10 it was confirmed that the empirical formulation results reflected in eq 5 portrays a positive agreement with ansys nonlinear finite element method nlfem simulation results r2 0 98 in overall in total 10 500 cases of ultimate strength results were compared to verify the distinction between ansys nlfem and the proposed empirical formulation in the future advanced data processing technique by artificial intelligence technique such as machine learning and deep learning technique could also be applied to predict the ultimate strength of stiffened panel subjected to longitudinal compression the purpose to use further advanced data processing technique might enable to predict more accurate uls values which will help the robust design of the ships and offshore structures in addition other types of stiffeners i e angle bar and flat bar should also be considered the outcome will be useful for structural designers in predicting the ultimate strength performance of stiffened panel in the early design stage additionally it could also be applied directly in assessing the structural safety of

22370,in the present study a data processing technique was introduced to develop a closed form shape empirical formulation in predicting ultimate strength of structures the proposed method was verified by applying a ship s stiffened panel as an applied example in particular a refined empirical formulation in predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened panel subjected to longitudinal compression was proposed recently kim et al 2017 observed that the ultimate strength behaviours fluctuated in small value of column slenderness ratio and urged the need for a more accurate empirical formulation in order for an accurate ultimate strength behaviour of stiffened panel to be obtained a total of 10 500 cases of numerical simulation results using the ansys finite element method fem

in many industrial fields such as information technology it manufacturing and many others driven by data fig 1 depicts a summary of data utilisation procedure including collection processing and optimisation samsung 2017 the importance of the data has highlighted and the following quote can be considered as one of the best examples by amazon s ceo that all the decisions are required to be made by measurable data for purpose of data collection various technologies were considered particularly internet of things iot or internet of everything ioe which produces data from the interaction between 1 things and things 2 human and human or 3 things and human clouding system has been widely used to collect data nowadays this technology has enabled for the collection of big data therefore requiring an advanced approach towards data processing there are mainly two 2 ways of processing data the conventional probabilistic approaches and advanced deep learning or neural network based approaches techniques wong and kim 2018 kim et al 2019b in the case of conventional technique it is capable of producing the outcome with empirical formulation shape or probabilistic approach by adopting the data optimisation technique advanced technique on the other hand refers to the utilisation of artificial intelligence such as machine learning and deep learning i e artificial neural network convolutional neural network etc in the present study the conventional technique was applied in developing the empirical formulation for predicting the ultimate strength of ship s t bar type stiffened panel subjected to longitudinal compression commonly probabilistic approaches and techniques have been developed and applied in various fields the technique proposed in this study may be considered as one of the conventional methods in the field of shipbuilding and offshore engineering simplified closed form shape equation or empirical formulation is still widely used in design guideline numerous studies have been conducted to develop the empirical formulations or simplified methods in predicting the ultimate strength of ships and offshore structures by considering intact and damaged conditions in particular hull girder caldwell 1965 paik and mansour 1995 paik et al 2012 2013 kim et al 2013a b 2014 2019a stiffened panel lin 1985 paik and thayamballi 1997 zhang and khan 2009 kim et al 2017 xu et al 2018 and un stiffened panel plate structures ueda et al 1975 carlsen 1977 ivanov and rousey 1979 soreide and czujko 1983 hughes 1983 dnv 1987 smith et al 1988 ueda et al 1992 cui and mansour 1998 paik et al 2004 kim et al 2018c have been the primary focus of several researchers in addition these types of closed form shape empirical formulations have been applied in predicting among others the time dependent damage environmental loading and fatigue performance of structure paik and kim 2012 mohd et al 2014 2019 kim et al 2018a seo et al 2018 recently a wide range of technical reviews on existing empirical formulations in predicting ultimate strength of plate were conducted and an advanced empirical formulation was also proposed by zhang 2015 in terms of stiffened panel kim et al 2018b conducted technical reviews on existing empirical formulations in predicting ultimate strength of stiffened panel including of steel and aluminium based structures moreover they provided statistical analysis results to evaluate the applicability of existing empirical formulations by comparing against the ansys nonlinear finite element method nlfem it was highlighted that the resultant ultimate limit state uls of the stiffened panel subjected to longitudinal compression tends to fluctuate in the lower range of the column slenderness ratio λ it therefore means that the resultant uls of stiffened panel is highly multivariate which cause highly nonlinear behaviour by various parameters as shown in fig 2 in these regards the necessity of a refined empirical formulation was raised by kim et al 2018b to represent these nonlinear behaviours rather than existing single line based empirical formulation in this study a data processing technique based on conventional approach was introduced to develop a refined empirical formulation in predicting the ultimate limit state of t bar stiffened panel subjected to longitudinal compression in the near future artificial neural network ann which is one of the deep learning techniques based prediction can also be introduced it means that the uls prediction by ann can be performed in order to check its applicability and accuracy 2 development of a refined empirical formulation in predicting uls of stiffened panels by conventional data processing technique the proposed procedure to develop empirical formulation is presented in fig 3 it can be classified into three major steps including 1 generation of input data 2 processing of data and 3 prediction of the results the proposed procedure conventional method in part i was verified by the applied example of stiffened panel it will in the end provide a refined empirical formulation in predicting ultimate limit state of stiffened panel subjected to longitudinal compression detailed steps of this technique is documented in this section 2 1 generation of input data from the previous study by kim et al 2018b shown in fig 2 it could be observed that ultimate strength of stiffened panel under longitudinal compression depicts the fluctuation behaviour in the relatively small value of column slenderness ratio λ this may be related to changes of the geometric properties of stiffened panel such as plate and stiffener the studies have conducted various numerical simulations with the resulting fe simulation outcomes being used as input data in the current study in summary the studies conducted 10 500 cases of numerical simulations applying the ansys nonlinear finite element method nlfem the selected scenarios are summarised in table 1 fig 2 plots the numerical simulation results of the 10 500 cases as shown in fig 2 geometry of stiffened panel can be represented by a combination of plate slenderness ratio β and column slenderness ratio λ in order to obtain the refined empirical formulation a detailed data processing technique needs to be applied from kim et al 2018b the input data were generated in accordance with the following steps 1 collection of the data 2 definition of detailed characteristics 3 selection of reliable scenarios and 4 calculation of ultimate strength represented in generating input data as shown in fig 3 details on input data may be referred to kim et al 2018b in the case of finite element modelling technique issc reports issc 2012 2015 may be referred to facilitate readers in obtaining a broader range of perspective and understanding of finite element modelling techniques and ultimate strength analysis procedures for plate stiffened panel and hull girders schematic view of stiffend panel applied boundary condition and initial deflection are presented in figs 4 5 and 6 respectively in brief two bays two span model ½ 1 ½ is adopted to take into account the effect of boundary region between the adjacent spans in the present study in addition longitudinal girders and transverse frames are replaced with a boundary condition that limits the displacement in the vertical direction z direction as zero in order to consider the effect of a continued stiffened panel a symmetric condition with rotation in the longitudinal x and vertical z directions were set as zero at the transverse edges while the symmetric condition with rotation in the transverse y and vertical z directions were set as zero at the longitudinal edges the shell element named shell 181 in ansys nlfem has been used with nearly 1 1 of element ratio between the plate length and breadth ten elements for plate were adopted between stiffeners while six and four elements were used for web height and flange breadth in the case of initial imperfections only initial distortion effect has been considered for plate and stiffeners in the present study while welding induced residual stress effect has not been considered in this study it is well known that three types of initial distortions such as plate initial deflection w o p l column type initial distortion of the stiffener w o c and sideways initial distortion of the stiffener w o s are generally considered for fe modelling of stiffened panel under longitudinal compression kim et al 2012a b among various types of initial deflection modes buckling mode is adopted to represent initial deflection of plate and stiffeners with average level as shown in eqs 1 1 to 1 3 details may be referred to issc report issc 2012 initial

the minimum integer satisfying a b m m 1 issc 2012 paik 2018 2 2 data processing 2 2 1 definition of the parameters assumption of the empirical formulation shape ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel was determined through a series of fe analysis as reflected in fig 2 the geometrical properties of stiffened panel i e plate thickness t p plate length a plate breadth b web height h w web thickness t w flange width b f and flange thickness t f caused the fluctuation in ultimate strength of stiffened panel therefore the fluctuation behaviour in ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel should be included and predicted by the refined empirical formulation from fig 2 it could be deduced that the single line shape empirical formulation may not be able to predict ultimate strength behaviour of stiffened panel although predictable by leveraging the polynomial function shape polynomial function represented in eq 2 is a combination of mathematical terms constructed with real number coefficients and nonnegative integer exponents eq 2 depicts a general shape of the polynomial function in which presents degree n as a function of the form the order of a polynomial defines the numbers of maximum and minimum points in the fitted function it allows a polynomial curve to have turning points as well as changing in slope to fit the data points besides that the polynomial equation would be able to contain one or more variables the variables in polynomial function will affect the slope changes in the data for instance possible factors that result in the fluctuation of ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel could be used as parameter in polynomial function to allow fluctuation of the predicted data 2 f x c 0 c 1 x c 2 x 2 c n 1 x n 1 c n x n where c real numbers or coefficients of the polynomial as shown in eq 3 plate slenderness ratio β and column slenderness ratio λ are vital parameters commonly applied in many existing empirical formulations as summarised in appendix a to predict ultimate strength of stiffened panel 3 σ x u σ y f β λ existing empirical formulations based on the combination of plate slenderness ratio and column slenderness ratio as presented in eq 3 were able to be compared with ansys nonlinear finite element method nlfem numerical simulations results as shown in fig 7 as would be expected the limitation of the existing empirical formulation found that single line shape function may not be capable of predicting the nonlinear fluctuation behaviour of ultimate strength of stiffened panel obtained by ansys nlfem on the other hand additional parameters need to be listed out for the development of a refined empirical formulation in predicting ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel sheikh et al 2002 proposed a set of dimensionless parameters β 1 to β 11 which influences the ultimate strength of stiffened panel as shown in table 2 for the additional parameters used in polynomial function dimensionless parameters proposed by sheikh et al 2002 were used in this study for the estimation of parameters furthermore additional dimensionless parameters were also suggested in this study to be used for parameter estimation based on the geometric parameter of stiffened panel as listed in table 3 2 2 2 transformation of the dimensionless parameters selected parameters could then be transformed into the form as shown in table 4 the original parameter p is transformed to many types of parameters among others including 1 p 1 p 2 p 2 p 1 p and ln p in this instance original parameter p was maintained in the list of transformed parameters so that all these listed transformed parameters can be applied as input data for the empirical formulation for example each parameter selected by the previous step as illustrated in tables 2 and 3 could be considered as the original parameter and after transformation following that of which the shape of the parameter transformed into that as shown in table 4 in this study only seven 7 typical shapes of transformation i e p 1 to p 7 as reflected in table 4 were considered additionally more shapes may be considered as well 2 2 3 generation of possible empirical formulation set for the generation of possible empirical formulation set general shape of the polynomial formula in eq 2 was recalled as depicted in eq 4 by assuming parameter p 4 f p c 0 c 1 p c 2 p 2 c n 1 p n 1 c n p n where c real numbers or coefficients of the polynomial from the given polynomial equation in eq 4 a number of scenarios could possibly be generated if more parameters of higher order were considered the empirical formulation may produce more accurate results however accuracy may be attained at the expense of its higher costs due to the complexity of the equation therefore requiring additional computational time as such the balance between efficiency and accuracy of the empirical formulation is a vital consideration in this study four parameters with 2nd order form was set as a limit to propose a refined empirical formulation for example general shapes of the four parameters with the limitation of 2nd order based equations are summarised in table 5 here ten basic shapes of the equations with applied examples are given for the selection of the best empirical formulation repeated processing is required in this study the obtained coefficient of determination r2 is 0 9 or above it is then considered as relevant equation to be proposed 2 3 selection of the best empirical formulation upon verification of the accuracy of the proposed empirical formulation the final shape of empirical formulation could then be suggested to be employed for end users based on the suggested polynomial equation in eq 4 and its applications in table 5 the best four parameters were decided based on the criteria of higher r2 values in order higher r2 value to be obtained a repetition of this loop is required afterwards the coefficient of the four parameters such as p 0 σ x u σ y p 1 λ p 2 β p 3 h w t w p 4 i p z i s z will be proposed as the empirical formulation p 0 here refers to the dependent parameter following eq 5 an empirical formulation shape was obtained to predict the ultimate strength of stiffened panel that was subjected to the longitudinal compression with higher coefficient of determination r2 0 98 the detailed fifteen coefficients i e c 0 to c 14 were also selected and presented in eq 5 table 6 summarizes the 15 coefficients c 0 to c 14 in this step it is recommended for the accuracy test to achieve r2 of 0 9 or more additional empirical formulation shape may then be considered should it not be applicable 5 σ x u σ y e q c 0 c 1 c 2 λ c 3 β c 4 h w t w c 5 i p z i s z λ c 6 c 7 β c 8 h w

finite element nlfem method kim et al 2018b in the similar shape ultimate strength results by proposed empirical formulation in eq 5 were also plotted in fig 8 once again figs 2 and 8 depicted the resulting ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel by ansys nlfem method and empirical formulation respectively as earlier mentioned the result of the proposed empirical formulation reflects positive agreement with ansys numerical simulation r2 0 98 to help readers understanding the appendix provides two additional examples of uls calculation by proposed empirical formulation in eq 5 in sum 10 500 cases of stiffened panels t bar only with seven 7 plate slenderness ratios i e β 0 7297 0 9991 1 5103 2 0295 2 3194 2 9620 and 3 4181 were employed to compare the ultimate strength results of ansys nlfem against the proposed empirical formulation the detailed comparison results were shown in fig 9 a g based on the given plate slenderness ratios the detailed r2 values based on each β were also verified by comparing the results in fig 9 it was confirmed that the proposed empirical formulation was able to produce well matched results based on the resulting r2 values as summarised in table 7 2 4 applicability test and the application of the development of refined empirical formulation the previous section verified the accuracy of the proposed empirical formulation furthermore the applicability of the proposed formulation was also investigated by the statistical analysis through the mean and coefficient of variation cov results as shown in fig 10 as expected the mean and cov values were close to 1 0 and 0 0 respectively in most cases of the plate slenderness ratio β this would infer that the proposed empirical formulation is applicable or replicable to the existing method in predicting the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel the applicability of the proposed empirical formulation was confirmed via the statistical analysis additionally the proposed equation should also be verified by typical scenarios of the stiffened panel in the event that the proposed empirical formulation was not able to accurately predict ultimate strength or a limitation of the range of stiffened panel s geometry was found in the given formulation which is a function of plate slenderness ratio β and column slenderness ratio λ then additional scenarios should be considered in this case 10 500 cases were considered to be a sufficient amount of input scenarios in order to avoid the applicability test in the final step the limitation of the proposed empirical formulation should be implemented in the case of the proposed empirical formulation in eq 5 the available range of the β and λ obtained by collected 10 500 stiffened panel scenarios shown in table 1 were represented in the shaded area with an equation as depicted in fig 11 this may be considered as a range of limitation of the proposed empirical formulation 3 discussion by comparison with other formulations recently kim et al 2018b has widely reviewed the existing empirical formulations in predicting ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels a number of numerical simulations 10 500 cases in total to be exact have also been conducted by ansys nonlinear finite element method based on the 10 500 cases of ansys results which were used as input data in the present study a refined empirical formulation was developed the ultimate strength results predicted by proposed empirical formulation of this study were compared against the existing methods such as design formulas euler perry robertson and johnson ostenfeld empirical formulations lin 1985 paik and thayamballi 1997 zhang and khan 2009 kim et al 2017 xu et al 2018 numerical simulation results by ansys and analytical solutions alps ulsap 2016 as shown in fig 12 for the comparison the same stiffened panel scenarios were adopted in fig 12 a to 12 g from the visualised outcomes of fig 12 single line shape empirical formulations or design formulations were observed to exhibit limitations in predicting the ultimate strength behaviour of the stiffened panel which kim et al 2018b had also highlighted this was the problem statement of this study in which necessitates a refined or advanced empirical formulation by adopting other more complex shapes of the formulation by assuming the polynomial equation shape it could predict better results than the existing methods this statement was supported by the statistical analysis results as shown in fig 13 a h and table a1 4 conclusions a useful data processing technique was introduced against the backdrop of the 4th industrial revolution in this paper a refined empirical formulation was developed to predict ultimate strength of t bar stiffened panel under longitudinal compression by conventional data processing technique it was found that stiffened panel had a higher geometric nonlinearity therefore concluding that a simplified or single line shape empirical formulation would not be relevant in representing the ultimate strength behaviour as a result the polynomial function based empirical formulation was proposed the outcome was also compared with existing formulations by statistical analysis as shown in table a1 and fig 10 it was confirmed that the empirical formulation results reflected in eq 5 portrays a positive agreement with ansys nonlinear finite element method nlfem simulation results r2 0 98 in overall in total 10 500 cases of ultimate strength results were compared to verify the distinction between ansys nlfem and the proposed empirical formulation in the future advanced data processing technique by artificial intelligence technique such as machine learning and deep learning technique could also be applied to predict the ultimate strength of stiffened panel subjected to longitudinal compression the purpose to use further advanced data processing technique might enable to predict more accurate uls values which will help the robust design of the ships and offshore structures in addition other types of stiffeners i e angle bar and flat bar should also be considered the outcome will be useful for structural designers in predicting the ultimate strength performance of stiffened panel in the early design stage additionally it could also be applied directly in assessing the structural safety of

22371,an approach is investigated in this study for structural dynamic analysis of a high speed planing hull in which the pointwise acceleration data collected from sea trials are enforced as base excitation the paper first performed the full boat analysis of an 11 meter high speed craft for a period of one wave impact selected from each of nine seakeeping runs the sea trial acceleration data collected from 11 accelerometers placed close to the centerline and the keel are enforced as input while those from 3 accelerometers placed around the pilot cabin are selected for validation the substructure dynamic analysis of the isolated pilot cabin was then conducted and validated in which 7 pointwise enforced accelerations are selected from the simulation output of the full boat dynamic analysis the substructure dynamic analysis enables detailed investigation of local stress concentrations where critical equipment and personnel are located the proposed approach can be extended to rigid flexible body coupling analysis of a high speed craft when it is running with large pitching and yawing motion keywords finite element model nd nastran patran planing hulls enforced acceleration rigid inflatable boat rib sea trials wave impact base excitation 1 introduction small fast vessels are usually equipped with planing hulls to increase speed the planing hull will locally generate high hydrodynamic pressure in high speed to reduce friction drag and wave resistance unfortunately a planing hull craft often encounters high slamming loads with high encountering frequency such slamming can suddenly alter sailing direction and speed and creates hazardous conditions not only for those individuals aboard but also for the traversing sea vessel itself from boat hull to onboard equipment in order to mitigate risk it is important that steps are taken to ensure the sea vessel is structurally sound for safe operation the slamming phenomena of a planing hull involves fully coupled dynamic interaction between fluid structure wind wave and the vessel itself it is a very challenging undertaking to fully understand the slamming phenomena and its consequences on the design and operation of a planing hull it has drawn attention of many researchers in the past to aid these efforts many drop wedge tests towing tank tests sea trials and numerical simulations have been conducted to collect the data on pointwise accelerations pressures and strains on planing hulls based upon the collected data allen et al 1978 introduced a semi empirical equation that correlates the impact pressure to the value of the 1 10th highest peak vertical acceleration similar semi empirical equations to estimate the impact pressure in terms of different levels of average acceleration have been developed and incorporated in design and safety rules chosen by various classification societies such as american bureau of shipping abs det norske veritas dnv or lloyd s register grimsley et al 2010 the different levels of the averaged vertical acceleration required in these impact pressure equations can be approximated in terms of wave height forward speed and geometry features of the planing hull savitsky and brown 1976 hoggard and jones 1980 as an example ojeda and his colleagues 2004 employed this approach to conduct a finite element analysis of a composite catamaran under static slamming load in their study both the impact pressure and the averaged acceleration are estimated based upon the dnv rules and assumed to be uniformly distributed through the wetted areas the different levels of averaged acceleration may also be directly represented in terms of the statistical parameters of the experimentally collected acceleration data in this case the collected acceleration data is commonly assumed to follow an exponential distribution as suggested early by fridsma 1971 recent studies have cautioned the use of the allen and jones equation these new investigations have come about by conducting new experiments or by numerical simulation riley et al 2010 2016 have pointed out the need of standardizing the definition of a slamming event to better characterize acceleration data razola et al 2014 improved the accuracy of the allen and jones equation by modifying the existing load carrying area aspect ratio and adding a new factor to count for the load transverse reduction furthermore some researchers have questioned the use of the exponential distribution to quantify the peak acceleration data razola et al 2016 vanderwerken and judge 2017 others have called for a dynamic structural analysis of a planing hull in a slamming event dessi and ciappi 2013 addressed the importance of taking both the impact force and its induced vibration into consideration to identify a slamming event on fast ships their conclusion was made based upon the slamming statistics collected from their investigation on the impact dynamics of a high speed ferry model in a towing tank razola et al 2014 indicated that to design a planing hull serving for a long life requires the understanding of local deformation and stresses under extreme slamming pressure joo et al 2017 and riley and peterson 2017 pointed out the need of pointwise impulse acceleration profile right under a crew seat or an on board equipment which are important for design of a suitable shock isolation mount for crew and operation safety these additional design considerations of a safe and robust planing hull require not only the average design pressure but the detailed structural responses of the boat at various concerned time instances this calls for a detailed dynamic structural analysis of the flexible boat in a slamming event full simulation of a slam impact event for a planing hull is still under development though significant advancement has been made recently the challenges lie on its multidisciplinary nature which requires intensive modeling and computational efforts the emerging approach is to develop a unified set of governing differential equations to cover all involved disciplines which are then solved with a unified numerical mesh and algorithm this approach is called the closely coupled approach hou et al 2012 yang 2018 studied the breaking water generated by a free fall rigid body due to an impact he modeled three different domains air fluid and rigid body in the same form of navier stokes equation in which the velocity and the pressure are the unknowns this method has yet to be extended to planing hulls the commonly used approach at this moment is called the loosely coupled approach yang and huang 2016 at each time instance the approach uses independently developed disciplinary models to simulate waves fluid and vessel structure separately the disciplinary solutions are then reconciled based upon the common interface conditions before moving on to the next time step the main challenges of this approach lie on the difficulties of accurately tracing the location of the moving boundary and transfer boundary velocity and pressure between domains which are modeled and discretized differently in many fsi applications the structure problem is usually solved by the finite element method the fluid problem on the other hand can be formulated and solved by a variety of methods in the case where the navier stokes equation was solved with a fixed grid in the fluid domain overset grids sukas et al 2017 and immersed method yang 2018 were proposed to overcome the issues of mismatched interface meshes others formulated and solved the fluid flow by the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian technique which incorporates the mesh movement in the fluid domain simulation aymone 2004 nordanger et al 2016 the isogeometric finite element approach was employed by nordanger et al 2016 to generate domain mesh automatically in each discipline and to produce an exact and smooth parameterization of the interface between domains furthermore a linear static structure subjected to boundary displacement was solved to guide the movement of meshes in the fluid domain the magnitude of the mesh movement in different areas in the fluid domain can be controlled by assigning different values of young s modulus to the areas of concern recently the lagrangian based smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method has been developed and applied to solve various multi physics problems including fluid structure interaction liu and liu 2010 the method can model detailed physics and handle large deformation and breaking surfaces it usually covers the fluid domain with mesh free particles each of which occupies a compact support along the fluid structure interface the sph method requires an efficient algorithm to calculate the distance between the structure boundary and the nearby fluid particles siemann and langrand 2017 hu et al 2014 ma and mahfuz 2012 simulated the heave and pitch of a multi hull ship model moving forward with a constant speed in a water tank its hull panel girders and web frames are made of sandwich composite panels the entire structure is discretized with 3 247 nodes and 3 162 shell elements ansys is used for a coupled fluid and structural analysis incorporated with harmonic surface waves simulated by a 2d potential flow model their results demonstrated that it is important to take the elastic deformation into account in the fsi analysis as it affects the fluid pressure distribution around the ship hull to further study the detailed failure modes in the web girder interface the authors first identified the high stress area from the global fsi analysis which was carried out based on a coarse mesh the local substructure was then constructed around the high stressed area with refined meshes the quasi static analysis of the substructure model was then performed subjected to the boundary force and displacement values obtained in the global fsi analysis xie et al 2018 investigated a water entry hydro elastic problem using fluent for fluid dynamics simulation ansys for structural analysis and the volume of fluid method for air water interface a constrained minimization was constructed to convert the element center pressure output from fluent to nodal pressure input to ansys the simulation results were compared satisfactorily with water entrance testing data stern and his colleagues used their comprehensive software cfdship iowa which models the viscous fluid domain with moving interface boundary between the vessel and the fluid and models the free surface with the level set method the surface pressure is first collected to derive the motion of the vessel which in turn alters the fluid domain boundary overset gridding is used for data transfer between interfaced domains this method enables visualization of physics details in fluid structure interaction carrica et al 2010 though this method is comprehensive it is computationally intensive in their recent work elastic deformation was considered only for part of the ship hull and solved by ansys finite element code volpi et al 2017 the results compared favorably with the testing results in sea trials alternatively fluid structure interaction in time domain was carried out only for a rigid vessel the instantaneous surface pressure was then applied to the finite element model of the flexible vessel to find the dynamic responses in a quasi static state volpi et al 2017 faltinsen 2005 recently fragassa 2019 conducted fsi simulation of a slamming of the boat hull of a rigid inflatable boat rib entering a calm water tank the model boat is 4 95 m long and 1 75 m wide the fsi simulation was done with the framework of the ls dyna software in which the boat hull was made of composite materials and discretized with 26 000 shell finite elements and the fluid domain was modeled and solved with the sph method the results showed that during water entry of the boat the maximal stress happened along the keel while the maximal deformation happened along the starboard and the port sides of the boat fragassa et al 2019 had also extended the ls dyna based tool to simulate the drop test of a composite laminated cylinder which fell into calm water with different impact velocities in this research effort the sph method was applied to model both air and water the results showed that including the air in the impact model improved the solution accuracy in predicting the maximal deformation during impact the studies of rosen garme and their colleagues razola et al 2014 2016 focused on the long term motion profile of a planing hull the approach they used is termed as a single disciplinary approach they solved only the equation of motion of a rigid planing hull for surging heaving and pitching subjected to the loads integrated from time dependent sectional pressures these sectional pressures were evaluated based upon the nonlinear strip theory which was derived from a potential flow model for vertical impact of a 2d wedge the advantage of this approach is its computational efficiency which enables the research team to conduct numerical simulation for a long period of time to generate enough acceleration data for statistical quantification in their study they pointed out the importance of setting the maximal allowable displacement and stress values of each panel for the lifelong design of a planing hull this is because local structure responses are the results of local extreme pressure applied to the flexible boat hull during slamming not the results of the averaged design pressure to address this issue they razola et al 2014 built a finite element model of a section of a boat hull structure dynamic analysis was then conducted for the modeled section subjected to a non uniform pressure distribution reconstructed from the pressure data collected from 12 pressure transducers the pressure distribution reconstruction strategy was derived based upon the assumption that a fluid particle moves with the same speed during an impact from the keel to the chine on a section of the planing hull rosen and garme 2004 rosen 2005 the single disciplinary approach will be employed in this paper as well to investigate structural dynamic response of a planing hull slamming event however in this study instead of pressure transducers the data collected from accelerometers will be used as enforced excitation to simulate the slamming loads enforced excitation referred here is a type of dynamic response induced by the time dependent boundary conditions prescribed in terms of displacement velocity or acceleration structural analysis through enforced excitation has been conducted on structures in the air and on the ground alike most notably in the analysis of space shuttle main engine structures and the induced vibration of structures during earthquakes or on a shaker table the large mass method is commonly used to enforce a single degree boundary motion in which the excitation force is set to be equal to the acceleration multiplied by the mass value clough and penzien 1975 davis et al 2012 used the enforced base excitation method to simulate the drop test response of an onboard equipment using a 6 degree of freedom dof motion simulator using the motion profile measured by a single base accelerometer mounted on the base of the platform as input the method is proved successful by validation through frequency and transient responses of the onboard equipment in a broader view a structure under enforced excitation can be formulated as a differential algebra equation dae which can be solved by introducing lagrange multipliers to impose the prescribed boundary motion the resultant set of equations can be solved by the elimination method or the penalty method chandrupatla and belegundu 2012 the elimination method separates the displacements into the boundary set and the relative or the interior set cho et al 2016 flanigan 1994 bampton and craig 1968 blades and craig 1997 the equation of motion of the entire structure can then be reformulated into two one is an ordinary differential equation solved for the interior or the relative displacements while the other is an algebra equation directly used to compute the value of the lagrange multipliers the penalty method has been commonly used in finite element problems for static structural analysis or dealing with incompressibility conditions in velocity pressure flow problems reddy 1984 though seldom used in the time dependent problems the work of liu and lu 2010 is an example which applied the penalty method to count for earthquake base excitation in seismic analysis of structures scovazzi et al 2017 proposed an interesting approach which not only achieves accurate velocity as well as stresses but accommodates easily with enforced velocity and stress boundary conditions their equation of motion is expressed in terms of the first order time derivatives of stresses and velocities the structural dynamic analysis of an 11 meter zodiac h1110 2005 rigid inflatable boat rib under a slamming event will be investigated here this is done by adopting the enforced motion analysis capability provided by the commercially available finite element analysis software nd patran and nastran which is built upon the elimination approach 2010 to handle single point acceleration constraints the report of this investigation is organized and grouped into four sections methods and materials full boat validation accelerometer placement and substructure application section 2 covers the methods and materials employed in this study this section is made of three sub sections section 2 1 briefly outlines the derivation of the equation of motion subjected to pointwise acceleration constraints this constrained dynamic equation forms the mathematical base for structural dynamic analysis under enforced excitation the required input variables for solving the derived equation of motion are the finite element data of the 11 meter rib of concern and the acceleration data collected during the sea trials of the same boat the details of the former are presented in section 2 2 and the latter in section 2 3 section 3 reports the validation process which is done by taking advantage of the commercially rated nastran software to perform the enforced structural dynamic analysis of the 11 meter rib pointwise acceleration profiles collected from eleven accelerometers during sea trials are filtered and prepared as input for these dynamic analyses the proposed enforced base excitation method was then validated by comparing the simulated acceleration output with the associated data collected at three above deck accelerometers from sea trials section 4 investigates the effects of the placement and the number of input accelerometers on the accuracy of numerical simulation it is followed by section 5 where the dynamic analysis of the pilot cabin is conducted the pilot cabin is separated from the hull boat as an isolated substructure the acceleration profiles are enforced at the selected 7 points located at the base of the pilot cabin values of these 7 input acceleration profiles are taken from the numerical simulation of the full boat analysis section 6 is the final section which concludes this study with conclusion remarks and suggestions for future study 2 methods and materials the first part of this section presents the detailed derivation of the equation of motion associated with base excitation the equation of motion is derived based upon the framework of constrained dynamics haug 1989 1992 this theoretical formulation serves as the foundation for dynamic analysis subjected to enforced acceleration the input data required for solving the derived equation of motion include the stiffness and mass matrices of the structure and the pointwise acceleration data for base excitation the second part of this section describes the finite element model of the 11 meter rib corbishdale 2014 which is the application focus of this study the last part of this section describes the acceleration data extraction process this is done with the help of a matlab code standard g murphy and planchak 2015 this code takes the acceleration data as input filters out the high frequency noise caused by vibration and uses a peak identification algorithm to count the number of peaks the model algorithm and data they provided were essential in the dynamic response analysis of the rib 2 1 equation of motion under base excitation the equation of motion of a free flexible structure under the given loading p t can be described as 1 m x t c x t k x t p t where m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrices and p t and x t are the force and the displacement vectors respectively the displacement vector x t in eq 1 is unknown the above equation maybe simplified as m x t f t x x p t c x t k x t in the case of enforced motion a given subset of degrees of freedom of the system are subjected to enforced acceleration which can be viewed as constraints imposed upon the solution of eq 1 that is 2 m x t f t x x subject to x b a t where the displacement vector is divided into two parts prescribed or free x t x i x b in which x i denotes the degrees of freedom free of constraints while the acceleration associated with x b are prescribed by the given values a t it should be noted that eq 2 can be extended to cases with enforced displacements and velocities haug 1992 as the constraint is holonomic eq 2 can be augmented by introducing the lagrange multipliers λ as 3 m i i m i b 0 m b i m b b i 0 i 0 x i x b λ f i t x i x i x b x b f b t x i x i x b x b a t equation 3 is a dae index 3 system the constraint imposed on the system equation is holonomic and with one single degree of freedom 4 x b a t which can be directly integrated and result in the velocity and the position constrains with given initial velocity and position u 0 and u 0 as 5 x b a t u 0 x b 1 2 a t 2 u 0 t u 0 therefore the solution of eq 3 is not subjected to any hidden constraints on velocity and displacement the most convenient way to solve eq 3 is by direct substitution of eq 4 the resultant equations become 6 m i i 0 m b i i x i λ f i m i b a f b m b b a the first row of eq 6 is a typical ode which can be solved with help of eq 3 as 7 m i i x i f i t x i x i x b x b m i b x b f i t x i x i u 0 u 0 a m i b a which yields the solutions x i t and x i t these solutions can be substituted back to the second row of eq 6 to compute the lagrange multiplier as λ f b t x i x i x b x b m b i x b f b t x i x i u 0 u 0 a m b i x i m b b a or more specifically 8 λ f b t x i x i u 0 u 0 a m b i m i i 1 f i m b i m i i 1 m i b m b b a the lagrange multiplier represents in fact the constraint force required to enable the system to maintain the prescribed acceleration alternative forms of dynamic equations to express eq 2 are available and can be found in the literature for applications in earthquake analysis launching of space rocket and impact drop test cho et al 2016 flanigan 1994 bampton and craig 1968 blades and craig 1997 2 2 finite element model of the rib the finite element model of a zodiac h1110 rib 2005 was originally created by researchers in order to find the approximate ideal locations for the sensors through modal analysis corbishdale 2014 the total length of the boat is 10 82 m with a maximum beam width of 2 68 m the boat is mainly made of composite and aluminum further specifications of the boat can be found on the zodiac milpro website listed in the references at the end of this paper the finite element model of the boat as shown in figs 1 and 2 was originally built by the software femap the model is made of 50 732 nodes 211 beam 50 634 quadrilateral and 798 triangular elements a total of 45 rigid bars were used to connect key structural nodes on the boat to 4 372 lumped masses these lumped masses represented the motor aft fuel tanks inside the boat and aft facility mounts aft and forward and other onboard equipment the rigid bar elements are shown in the model figs 1 and 2 as purple lines and circles some of the other nodes in the images of the model are an orange color to represent nodes connected to smeared masses such as armor plating hatches windows radar and other equipment the finite element model was later imported to nd nastran and patran which is the finite element code used in this study the longitudinal center of gravity lcg of the physical boat as measured from the transom keel intersection was approximately 3 18 m with an uncertainty of approximately 0 872 the finite element model of the boat had its lcg located at approximately 3 43 m as measured from the transom keel intersection corbishdale 2014 this difference between the lcg locations on the physical boat and the finite element model is approximately 7 76 which is outside the uncertainty in the lcg measurement of the real world boat however the finite element model of the boat was given the same weight 15 320 lbs as its real world counterpart corbishdale 2014 it is also important to note that both the calm water and rough water trials were conducted with a weight of 15 845 lbs with the addition of crew seats ballast and instrumentation it had reduced fuel and the rack and bench were removed corbishdale 2014 this also changed the lcg of the physical boat from 3 18 m to 3 22 m from the transom keel intersection corbishdale 2014 the modal analysis of the rib boat was initially conducted by neinastran with three different sets of boundary conditions corbishdale 2014 one is done with no boundary conditions the others are done with 1 hz and 2 hz vertical spring constraints the spring constraints allow calculation of the percent modal mass of each elastic mode the modal analysis was then repeated with nd nastran for validation the averaged differences between the reported results and those obtained from nd nastran are 1 16 1 20 and 1 14 for all 200 modes respectively with free free 1 hz and 2 hz spring boundary conditions the highest error is 2 97 in mode 22 with free free boundary condition three example results of modal analysis with all three boundary conditions are reported in table 1 for both the reported and the newly obtained ones the primary hull bending mode is a global mode of interest and the seat pedestal box mode and the aft cabin panel modes are the local modes associated with the pilot cabin the percent modal masses of the global mode the seat pedestal box mode and the aft cabin panel mode are about 70 0 2 and 3 3 respectively 2 3 vertical acceleration data sea trials were conducted on an 11 meter rib to investigate wave impact phenomena murphy and planchak 2015 the sea trials covered a wide range of speeds and significant wave heights a total of 23 accelerometers were mounted around the boat to collect the acceleration data mainly associated with vertical motion the accelerometers were placed at the locations which are rigid and stiff to avoid the effects of flexible vibration although the finite element model was highly detailed it did not model all structural components with the same materials and properties as those in the physical rib as such only fourteen accelerometers are used in this study whose physical locations can be identified and associated with finite element nodal numbers eleven of them 1z 2z 3z 4z 6z 7z 8z 9z 11z 17z and 21z are selected for input of enforced excitation while three of the fourteen 10z 13z and 16z are for validation the locations of all said accelerometers are presented in figs 1 and 2 the vertical accelerometers are marked with red arrows in fig 1 while they are marked with red dots in fig 2 the accelerometers 1z 3z and 6z are all aligned with the centerline around the keel and 2z is also centered but placed in front of the engine box the accelerometers 4z and 7z are placed on the deck plate one is at transom and the other is in front of the pilot cabin the rest of the accelerometers are placed around the cabin the accelerometers 8z and 9z are placed respectively at the centerline and on the port side underneath the front bulkhead of the cabin the accelerometer 10z is centered on the deck plate inside the cabin and the accelerometer 11z is underneath the cabin door near the lcg the accelerometer 16z is on the cabin top while the accelerometers 13z 17z and 21z are all placed inside the cabin to measure the motions of the console and the seats on the port and starboard sides respectively two types of accelerometers were used silicon designs model 2260 025 and 2260 050 the sample rate of these accelerometers is set as 2000 per second in this study these accelerometers could measure acceleration along three coordinate axes and the positive coordinate directions are labeled on the accelerometer housings the accelerometers were mounted so that the positive z coordinate direction was pointed normal to the deck of the rib and skyward efforts were made to keep the boat as level as possible during the sea trials however in rougher seas it was much more difficult it is assumed in this study that the planing craft during the sea trials was not subjected to large angular rotation consequently the z direction of the accelerometers remains parallel during the simulation to the z direction of the global coordinate system which was the base in deriving the equation of motion eq 7 nine head sea run data are selected in this study their information is summarized in table 2 the data collected was categorized into three envelopes depending upon the conditions of head sea runs the top three runs listed in table 2 make up the constant speed envelope where the average craft speed was approximately the same over three different wave heights the middle three runs make up the constant wave height envelope where the significant wave heights were about the same over three different average craft speeds and the last three runs are where the rib was at or near the maximum safe speed for the boat operator in the given ocean conditions and make up the maximum safe speed envelope the maximum safe speed referred here was related to significant wave height after approximately 1 m in significant wave height the maximum speed of the boat had to be reduced in order to prevent risk of damage to the sensors and related equipment the boat and personnel in depth details of the data collection effort are presented in murphy and planchak 2015 the acceleration data collected from sea trials are the results of the combined rigid body motion and the flexible vibration to correlate the acceleration data with the impact force for a slamming event a standardized process riley et al 2010 2012 has been developed in order to extract the rigid body dominated acceleration data associated with an isolated slamming event the process first filters out the high frequency vibration modes and then sets up the amplitude and the time thresholds in order to identify the peaks of accelerations statistical terms of the collected peak acceleration data such as rms and the average of the highest one third or one tenth can then be quantified to estimate the static equivalent impact load a matlab code called the standard g riley and coats 2013 murphy and planchak 2015 developed based upon the described process was used in this study to filter out the acceleration data around a peak of acceleration 3 full boat validation the process begins with analysis of data collected during sea trials the raw data collected from the accelerometer 1z and the associated single sided amplitude spectrum are displayed in figs 3 and 4 as an example input and output of the standard g code fig 4 demonstrates that the dominated modes are below 10 hz as suggested by riley and coats 2012a b the low pass fourth order butterworth filter is then applied to the data set to remove the high frequency noise the filtered data forms the base for the peak acceleration and wave impact counts in order to obtain meaningful results with manageable simulation time and data storage space only one impact event is considered in this study for one specific sea trial run the specific impact event is selected based upon the data collected from 11z which is located near the lcg the highest peak of the acceleration is first identified a total of 2000 data points before and after the highest peak to cover a period of one second are then collected to form the data set of a single wave impact the data sets are all collected for the rest of 13 accelerometers with the same time frame as that of 11z this process is carried out for all seakeeping runs listed in table 2 the full boat dynamic analysis is conducted by nd nastran the detailed input commands and examples for enforced transient analysis can be found in nd nastran user manual 2010 the procedure is mainly centered on two key bulk data commands tload1 and lseq tload1 provides the time history of the excited force while lseq specifies the location where the excited force is imposed pamidi and reymond 2000 the type entry in tload1 is specified as acce so that the input data listed in table 1 is taken as an enforced acceleration the excited entry in tload1 is linked to the darea entry in lseq lseq on the other hand refers to the spcd command card to identify the nodal number where the excitation enforcement is imposed the same nodal number is also referred in the spc1 command card so that the node of concern and the associated degrees of freedom at which the acceleration is enforced can be treated as a single point boundary condition the entire simulation is done with a dell desktop model optiplex 990 due to the limit on memory only every fourth of the collected data are collected and included as input in the table 1 format this process is carried out for all 11 input acceleration data sets associated with 1z 2z 3z 4z 6z 7z 8z 9z 11z 17z and 21z limited by the simulation time and the computer memory only two sets of output at the selected nodes are reported in these simulation runs the nodal displacement and the nodal acceleration the sample snapshots of the motion profile of the boat during one second of a wave impact period are presented in fig 5 for the subcase 3 seakeeping run in the constant speed envelope the colors in the figures range from red to blue denoting the magnitudes of the point displacements from high to low the dark blue mesh indicates the initial position of the vessel which starts with zero displacement and zero velocity particularly fig 6 shows two different views of the instantaneous deformation of the entire boat at time 0 31 s which is at the acceleration peak during the constant speed subcase 3 seakeeping run it can be observed that the boat heaves and pitches during this wave impact event the nastran acceleration data at 10z 13z and 16z are output specifically for comparison purpose with the filtered raw data figs 7 9 display the nastran output data filtered at 10 hz alongside with the full boat raw data filtered also at 10 hz for all three seakeeping envelopes each of which has three subcases the speeds of the vessels and wave conditions of these envelopes and subcases can be found in table 2 the simulation results match well with the raw data in the high and smooth acceleration regions also note that the simulation generates high frequency oscillation after the impact which is not found in the filtered raw data this is particularly evident at the accelerometer 16z which is mounted on the top of the pilot cabin far away from the keel of the boat to better quantify the difference between the raw data and the simulation output the root mean square deviation rmsd and the normalized rmsd are calculated for each of the subcases the results are tabulated in table 3 let the error ε i at the ith time instance be defined as the difference between the filtered sea trial acceleration data a i e x p and the filtered nastran output a i s i m that is 9 ε i a i e x p a i s i m based on eq 9 the rmsd is obtained for n total number of samples r m s d i 1 n ε i 2 n while the normalized rmsd represents the percentage deviation relative to the range of the given data set n o r m a l i z e d r m s d r m s d a i m a x e x p a i m i n e x p data in table 3 reveal that subcase 2 of the constant speed envelope has the highest percentage error among all subcases while subcase 2 of the constant wave height envelope has the lowest percentage error the maximal acceleration of the former is lower than 2 46 g while that of the latter is greater than 6 48 g this observation implies that the acceleration enforced dynamic simulation achieves better accuracy with higher peak acceleration impact it is also interesting to notice that among all output accelerometers 10z 13z and 16z the simulation data at 16z produces the most accurate results the latter observation could be the result of the fact that 16z is mounted at the top of the pilot cabin farthest away from the keel of the boat the elasticity of the vessel structure softens the impact of rigid modes on acceleration while promoting local low amplitude vibration after impact in fact fig 7 through 9 appear to support this conclusion based on the higher acceleration frequency of 16z in the unfiltered data as compared to the acceleration frequency of 10z and 13z 4 placement of accelerometers in the enforced excitation the input pointwise accelerations are viewed as the impact forces most of the 11 accelerometers selected as input for dynamic modeling are placed along the centerline and in the lower deck near the keel except 3 accelerometers 9z 17z and 21z as shown in fig 2 all these three are placed at the base of the pilot cabin the accelerometers 17z and 21z are symmetrically placed along the centerline 17z is on the port side while 21z is on the starboard the accelerometer 9z is placed on the port side underneath the front bulkhead of the pilot cabin the locations of these three accelerometers are far from the wet surface therefore their accelerometers may not directly relate to the wave impact forces rather they serve as the enforced adjustment this section first investigates the effects of these three off center acceleration enforcements on the accuracy of the output pointwise accelerations at 10z 13z and 16z it is then extended to include 4z and 8z in this study that are the accelerometers placed near the top deck note that the output accelerometers 10z 13z and 16z that are used for validation are placed along the centerline of the pilot cabin 10z is on the base 13z the front midsection and 16z the top of the pilot cabin the enforced dynamic simulations conducted in section 3 are repeated here with different sets of input enforced accelerations that selectively excluded those accelerometers placed off line or above deck height only subcase 3 of the constant speed envelope is selected as a demonstrative seakeeping run in this study the vessel in this case runs with an average speed of 20 3 knots and an average wave period 6 4 seconds the rmsd s and the associated normalized values of various scenarios with different sets of input accelerometers are summarized in table 4 along with the data of the original runs for comparison it is observed that removal of accelerometers involved 17z and 21z which are on the port side and the starboard respectively will reduce the accuracy of the dynamic responses at three selected output accelerometers which are mounted on the base the front and the top of the pilot cabin particularly large errors are observed at the output accelerometers 13z and 16z which are on the front console and on the top of the pilot cabin removal of the un symmetric accelerometer 9z alone doesn t affect the accuracy of the output accelerometers nor does removal of accelerometers 4z and 8z accelerometer 4z locates at the stern on the top surface right above 3z which is mounted on the keel accelerometer 8z is mounted on the base of the front bulkhead of the pilot cabin along the centerline as an example the acceleration output of the case with removal of 8z and 9z is plotted in fig 10 along with the sea trial raw data note that fig 7 c displays the initial acceleration responses without removing 8z and 9z from input data set in a summary two primary conclusions may be drawn from the study in this section one it is more important to place the enforced accelerometers along the keel or near to it than those high above it and two it is beneficial to place the input enforced accelerometers around the structural area of concern particularly if this area is flexible in this case these enforced accelerometers serve as constraints or adjustments rather than the representations of the input excitation forces 5 dynamic substructure analysis of the pilot cabin dynamic substructure analysis could be used to accomplish refined analysis without imposing a burden on computer resources in this study one will focus on the vibration characteristics of the pilot cabin which affects onboard instrument noise and crew comfortability while operating a rib the finite element model of the pilot cabin isolated from the main deck of the rib is shown in fig 11 the base of the pilot cabin is rectangular around 1 92 by 2 92 m 75 5 by 115 inches the dynamic analysis of the pilot cabin during a wave impact is carried out following the same acceleration enforcement procedure as presented before however in this case the input accelerations at the selected points on the base of the isolated pilot cabin are taken not from the sea trials but from the full boat dynamic analysis conducted in section 2 to this end it is necessary to select an appropriate set of input base excitation accelerations as well as their locations ideal locations for the input acceleration nodes are assumed to be at the top of bulkheads beneath the cabin for the rigidity of the bulkheads however in the current design the walls of the pilot cabin at its base are not aligned with the bulkhead intersections therefore the nodes on the base of the cabin that are closest to the intersections of the transverse and the longitudinal bulkheads are first selected as the cabin input acceleration three additional acceleration input nodes are then selected one is on the middle section along the port side of the pilot cabin another along the starboard and the other is at the center of the front bulkhead at the end seven acceleration input nodes in total are selected in this study the side view of the transverse bulkhead and the pilot cabin is shown in fig 12 while the locations of the seven input acceleration nodes are marked in fig 13 on the mesh model of the base of the pilot cabin note that like those in figs 1 and 2 the purple bars in figs 11 and 12 mark the rigid bar elements connecting lumped masses to the key structural nodes and the orange nodes are those with smeared masses next the acceleration data at the seven selected nodes are taken from the output of the full boat dynamic analysis filtered out at 10 hz and then input as the enforced base excitation for the dynamic analysis of the isolated pilot cabin model this is carried out only for subcase 3 seakeeping trial run of the constant speed envelope the output of acceleration data at 10z 13z and 16z mounted on the pilot cabin are selected and compared with the sea trial acceleration data as well as those out of the full boat dynamic analysis all these data are filtered out at 10 hz and displayed in fig 14 a it is evident that all three cases engage high local vibration after peak acceleration this is particularly significant in accelerometer 16z which is on the top of the pilot cabin this leads to the reinvestigation of the spectrum plot of the raw acceleration data at 16z fig 15 shows that the frequencies ranging between 9 and 12 hz do contribute significantly to the content of 16z acceleration in fact corbishdale 2014 reported in his full boat finite element modal analysis that significant local modes related to the pilot cabin are at 11 2 hz and 12 6 hz consequently the dynamic substructure analysis is repeated by filtering out the output of the full boat dynamic analysis at 13 hz before taking them as input to enforce excitation the newly obtained results are plotted in fig 14 b when filtered at a higher frequency more local vibration modes are observed due to the high frequency filtered enforced excitation results show that a 45 reduction in normalized rmsd from 0 0558 to 0 0306 is observed when filtered at 13 hz instead of 10 hz this example demonstrates that the dynamic analysis of a full boat with enforced acceleration can be successfully extended to an isolated substructure if the number and the location of the interface excitation nodes are properly selected this is done without any additional sea trial data as a final investigation the acceleration and the stress output around the seat pedestals are collected for the isolated pilot cabin all these results reported here are filtered at 13 hz the acceleration plots for the port seat pedestal and the starboard seat pedestal are summarized in fig 16 for a single wave impact it is interesting to notice that after peak impact both seat pedestals are subjected to around 8 hz of high acceleration repeated impact which are not noticeable in the output of all other accelerometers in this study this conclusion however is drawn only for subcase 3 sea trial of constant speed envelope due to the requirement of a large data storage space nastran is unable to report the stress time history for the full rib model as the size of the finite element model is reduced it is then feasible to report the stress contour time history of the entire isolated pilot cabin particularly the von mises stress histories during a wave impact at the port and the starboard seat pedestals are selected and plotted in fig 17 and the stress contour plots of the pilot cabin are reported at time 0 298 s and 0 458 s respectively in fig 18 the first plot in fig 18 a is associated with the first acceleration peak of the port seat pedestal at 0 298 s while the second plot in fig 18 b is with the second acceleration peak of the starboard seat pedestal at 0 458 s 6 conclusion and recommendations the development of methods and procedures to better understand the dynamic responses of high speed planing hulls to wave impacts is necessary in order to mitigate risk to crew and equipment in the current work the structure dynamic analysis of a high speed planing craft is completed by enforcing the collected pointwise acceleration data on a valid finite element model the thoughtfully built finite element model of a rib along with the acceleration data collected from sea trails are essential to facilitate this study the proposed method is validated by focusing on nine single wave impacts each of which is associated with one specific seakeeping condition selected from the available sea trial data the acceleration data acquired from 11 accelerometers placed inside the lower boat hull are selected as the input enforced acceleration while those collected from 3 accelerometers mounted on the top and the base of the pilot cabin are used to investigate the accuracy of the simulation the results demonstrate that the output of the proposed method matches well with those of sea trial data particularly the proposed method achieves higher accuracy for the higher peak acceleration case than for the lower ones for example the simulation achieves less than 7 3 error measured by the normalized rmsd for the seakeeping run with an average craft speed of 18 9 knots significant wave height 1 19 m and wave period of 5 6 s the peak acceleration in this case collected during sea trials ranges from 6 48 g to 7 39 g in the three output accelerometers mounted around the pilot cabin the high peak acceleration is usually a condition of major concern for design and operation of a high speed planing hull in the second phase of this study the issue about the number and the placement of input accelerometers is investigated the accelerometers aligned along the keel and near the bottom hull are found to be more important to the accuracy of the simulation than those away and off the centerline furthermore it is beneficial to place the input accelerometers around the base of the pilot cabin even though these accelerometers do not directly represent the impact load they are the constrained forces which adjust the solution of the substructure that is placed far away from the keel finally the enforced acceleration method is extended successfully to conduct the dynamic analysis of an isolated pilot cabin the input acceleration data set is selected from the output of the full boat numerical simulation to excite the pilot cabin this approach allows for more focused efficient and comprehensive substructure analysis which is needed for mounting instrument and crew seats onboard a high speed craft this paper represents an initial attempt to employ the base excitation method for dynamic analysis of a high speed craft with the enforced acceleration based upon the sea trial data this method is structure based doesn t involve computational fluid dynamics nor fluid structure interaction though the effects of structural damping and large pitching movement were not considered in this study the results of this study were validated satisfactorily it should be noticed that its success relies upon the accurate finite element model and the carefully filtered acceleration data the successful demonstration presented in this paper has opened a door for more broad investigation of the proposed method one is to calculate the constraint loads λ in eq 8 which are the ones to enforce the prescribed motion the magnitudes of λ could be useful to correlate the pressure load distribution to acceleration and provide an insight into selecting proper locations to place accelerometers the other is to extend the method to simulate a planing hull operated under large pitching and yawing conditions in these cases additional sensor data such as those collected from imu 3 axis accelerometers and strain gauges may be used for further enforcement and validation acknowledgements this research was partially funded by the naval engineering education consortium neec under the navy grant n0017416c0031 awarded to old dominion university research foundation the authors would like to express their gratitude to dr timothy coats

22371,an approach is investigated in this study for structural dynamic analysis of a high speed planing hull in which the pointwise acceleration data collected from sea trials are enforced as base excitation the paper first performed the full boat analysis of an 11 meter high speed craft for a period of one wave impact selected from each of nine seakeeping runs the sea trial acceleration data collected from 11 accelerometers placed close to the centerline and the keel are enforced as input while those from 3 accelerometers placed around the pilot cabin are selected for validation the substructure dynamic analysis of the isolated pilot cabin was then conducted and validated in which 7 pointwise enforced accelerations are selected from the simulation output of the full boat dynamic analysis the substructure dynamic analysis enables detailed investigation of local stress concentrations where critical equipment and personnel are located the proposed approach can be extended to rigid flexible body coupling analysis of a high speed craft when it is running with large pitching and yawing motion keywords finite element model nd nastran patran planing hulls enforced acceleration rigid inflatable boat rib sea trials wave impact base excitation 1 introduction small fast vessels are usually equipped with planing hulls to increase speed the planing hull will locally generate high hydrodynamic pressure in high speed to reduce friction drag and wave resistance unfortunately a planing hull craft often encounters high slamming loads with high encountering frequency such slamming can suddenly alter sailing direction and speed and creates hazardous conditions not only for those individuals aboard but also for the traversing sea vessel itself from boat hull to onboard equipment in order to mitigate risk it is important that steps are taken to ensure the sea vessel is structurally sound for safe operation the slamming phenomena of a planing hull involves fully coupled dynamic interaction between fluid structure wind wave and the vessel itself it is a very challenging undertaking to fully understand the slamming phenomena and its consequences on the design and operation of a planing hull it has drawn attention of many researchers in the past to aid these efforts many drop wedge tests towing tank tests sea trials and numerical simulations have been conducted to collect the data on pointwise accelerations pressures and strains on planing hulls based upon the collected data allen et al 1978 introduced a semi empirical equation that correlates the impact pressure to the value of the 1 10th highest peak vertical acceleration similar semi empirical equations to estimate the impact pressure in terms of different levels of average acceleration have been developed and incorporated in design and safety rules chosen by various classification societies such as american bureau of shipping abs det norske veritas dnv or lloyd s register grimsley et al 2010 the different levels of the averaged vertical acceleration required in these impact pressure equations can be approximated in terms of wave height forward speed and geometry features of the planing hull savitsky and brown 1976 hoggard and jones 1980 as an example ojeda and his colleagues 2004 employed this approach to conduct a finite element analysis of a composite catamaran under static slamming load in their study both the impact pressure and the averaged acceleration are estimated based upon the dnv rules and assumed to be uniformly distributed through the wetted areas the different levels of averaged acceleration may also be directly represented in terms of the statistical parameters of the experimentally collected acceleration data in this case the collected acceleration data is commonly assumed to follow an exponential distribution as suggested early by fridsma 1971 recent studies have cautioned the use of the allen and jones equation these new investigations have come about by conducting new experiments or by numerical simulation riley et al 2010 2016 have pointed out the need of standardizing the definition of a slamming event to better characterize acceleration data razola et al 2014 improved the accuracy of the allen and jones equation by modifying the existing load carrying area aspect ratio and adding a new factor to count for the load transverse reduction furthermore some researchers have questioned the use of the exponential distribution to quantify the peak acceleration data razola et al 2016 vanderwerken and judge 2017 others have called for a dynamic structural analysis of a planing hull in a slamming event dessi and ciappi 2013 addressed the importance of taking both the impact force and its induced vibration into consideration to identify a slamming event on fast ships their conclusion was made based upon the slamming statistics collected from their investigation on the impact dynamics of a high speed ferry model in a towing tank razola et al 2014 indicated that to design a planing hull serving for a long life requires the understanding of local deformation and stresses under extreme slamming pressure joo et al 2017 and riley and peterson 2017 pointed out the need of pointwise impulse acceleration profile right under a crew seat or an on board equipment which are important for design of a suitable shock isolation mount for crew and operation safety these additional design considerations of a safe and robust planing hull require not only the average design pressure but the detailed structural responses of the boat at various concerned time instances this calls for a detailed dynamic structural analysis of the flexible boat in a slamming event full simulation of a slam impact event for a planing hull is still under development though significant advancement has been made recently the challenges lie on its multidisciplinary nature which requires intensive modeling and computational efforts the emerging approach is to develop a unified set of governing differential equations to cover all involved disciplines which are then solved with a unified numerical mesh and algorithm this approach is called the closely coupled approach hou et al 2012 yang 2018 studied the breaking water generated by a free fall rigid body due to an impact he modeled three different domains air fluid and rigid body in the same form of navier stokes equation in which the velocity and the pressure are the unknowns this method has yet to be extended to planing hulls the commonly used approach at this moment is called the loosely coupled approach yang and huang 2016 at each time instance the approach uses independently developed disciplinary models to simulate waves fluid and vessel structure separately the disciplinary solutions are then reconciled based upon the common interface conditions before moving on to the next time step the main challenges of this approach lie on the difficulties of accurately tracing the location of the moving boundary and transfer boundary velocity and pressure between domains which are modeled and discretized differently in many fsi applications the structure problem is usually solved by the finite element method the fluid problem on the other hand can be formulated and solved by a variety of methods in the case where the navier stokes equation was solved with a fixed grid in the fluid domain overset grids sukas et al 2017 and immersed method yang 2018 were proposed to overcome the issues of mismatched interface meshes others formulated and solved the fluid flow by the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian technique which incorporates the mesh movement in the fluid domain simulation aymone 2004 nordanger et al 2016 the isogeometric finite element approach was employed by nordanger et al 2016 to generate domain mesh automatically in each discipline and to produce an exact and smooth parameterization of the interface between domains furthermore a linear static structure subjected to boundary displacement was solved to guide the movement of meshes in the fluid domain the magnitude of the mesh movement in different areas in the fluid domain can be controlled by assigning different values of young s modulus to the areas of concern recently the lagrangian based smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method has been developed and applied to solve various multi physics problems including fluid structure interaction liu and liu 2010 the method can model detailed physics and handle large deformation and breaking surfaces it usually covers the fluid domain with mesh free particles each of which occupies a compact support along the fluid structure interface the sph method requires an efficient algorithm to calculate the distance between the structure boundary and the nearby fluid particles siemann and langrand 2017 hu et al 2014 ma and mahfuz 2012 simulated the heave and pitch of a multi hull ship model moving forward with a constant speed in a water tank its hull panel girders and web frames are made of sandwich composite panels the entire structure is discretized with 3 247 nodes and 3 162 shell elements ansys is used for a coupled fluid and structural analysis incorporated with harmonic surface waves simulated by a 2d potential flow model their results demonstrated that it is important to take the elastic deformation into account in the fsi analysis as it affects the fluid pressure distribution around the ship hull to further study the detailed failure modes in the web girder interface the authors first identified the high stress area from the global fsi analysis which was carried out based on a coarse mesh the local substructure was then constructed around the high stressed area with refined meshes the quasi static analysis of the substructure model was then performed subjected to the boundary force and displacement values obtained in the global fsi analysis xie et al 2018 investigated a water entry hydro elastic problem using fluent for fluid dynamics simulation ansys for structural analysis and the volume of fluid method for air water interface a constrained minimization was constructed to convert the element center pressure output from fluent to nodal pressure input to ansys the simulation results were compared satisfactorily with water entrance testing data stern and his colleagues used their comprehensive software cfdship iowa which models the viscous fluid domain with moving interface boundary between the vessel and the fluid and models the free surface with the level set method the surface pressure is first collected to derive the motion of the vessel which in turn alters the fluid domain boundary overset gridding is used for data transfer between interfaced domains this method enables visualization of physics details in fluid structure interaction carrica et al 2010 though this method is comprehensive it is computationally intensive in their recent work elastic deformation was considered only for part of the ship hull and solved by ansys finite element code volpi et al 2017 the results compared favorably with the testing results in sea trials alternatively fluid structure interaction in time domain was carried out only for a rigid vessel the instantaneous surface pressure was then applied to the finite element model of the flexible vessel to find the dynamic responses in a quasi static state volpi et al 2017 faltinsen 2005 recently fragassa 2019 conducted fsi simulation of a slamming of the boat hull of a rigid inflatable boat rib entering a calm water tank the model boat is 4 95 m long and 1 75 m wide the fsi simulation was done with the framework of the ls dyna software in which the boat hull was made of composite materials and discretized with 26 000 shell finite elements and the fluid domain was modeled and solved with the sph method the results showed that during water entry of the boat the maximal stress happened along the keel while the maximal deformation happened along the starboard and the port sides of the boat fragassa et al 2019 had also extended the ls dyna based tool to simulate the drop test of a composite laminated cylinder which fell into calm water with different impact velocities in this research effort the sph method was applied to model both air and water the results showed that including the air in the impact model improved the solution accuracy in predicting the maximal deformation during impact the studies of rosen garme and their colleagues razola et al 2014 2016 focused on the long term motion profile of a planing hull the approach they used is termed as a single disciplinary approach they solved only the equation of motion of a rigid planing hull for surging heaving and pitching subjected to the loads integrated from time dependent sectional pressures these sectional pressures were evaluated based upon the nonlinear strip theory which was derived from a potential flow model for vertical impact of a 2d wedge the advantage of this approach is its computational efficiency which enables the research team to conduct numerical simulation for a long period of time to generate enough acceleration data for statistical quantification in their study they pointed out the importance of setting the maximal allowable displacement and stress values of each panel for the lifelong design of a planing hull this is because local structure responses are the results of local extreme pressure applied to the flexible boat hull during slamming not the results of the averaged design pressure to address this issue they razola et al 2014 built a finite element model of a section of a boat hull structure dynamic analysis was then conducted for the modeled section subjected to a non uniform pressure distribution reconstructed from the pressure data collected from 12 pressure transducers the pressure distribution reconstruction strategy was derived based upon the assumption that a fluid particle moves with the same speed during an impact from the keel to the chine on a section of the planing hull rosen and garme 2004 rosen 2005 the single disciplinary approach will be employed in this paper as well to investigate structural dynamic response of a planing hull slamming event however in this study instead of pressure transducers the data collected from accelerometers will be used as enforced excitation to simulate the slamming loads enforced excitation referred here is a type of dynamic response induced by the time dependent boundary conditions prescribed in terms of displacement velocity or acceleration structural analysis through enforced excitation has been conducted on structures in the air and on the ground alike most notably in the analysis of space shuttle main engine structures and the induced vibration of structures during earthquakes or on a shaker table the large mass method is commonly used to enforce a single degree boundary motion in which the excitation force is set to be equal to the acceleration multiplied by the mass value clough and penzien 1975 davis et al 2012 used the enforced base excitation method to simulate the drop test response of an onboard equipment using a 6 degree of freedom dof motion simulator using the motion profile measured by a single base accelerometer mounted on the base of the platform as input the method is proved successful by validation through frequency and transient responses of the onboard equipment in a broader view a structure under enforced excitation can be formulated as a differential algebra equation dae which can be solved by introducing lagrange multipliers to impose the prescribed boundary motion the resultant set of equations can be solved by the elimination method or the penalty method chandrupatla and belegundu 2012 the elimination method separates the displacements into the boundary set and the relative or the interior set cho et al 2016 flanigan 1994 bampton and craig 1968 blades and craig 1997 the equation of motion of the entire structure can then be reformulated into two one is an ordinary differential equation solved for the interior or the relative displacements while the other is an algebra equation directly used to compute the value of the lagrange multipliers the penalty method has been commonly used in finite element problems for static structural analysis or dealing with incompressibility conditions in velocity pressure flow problems reddy 1984 though seldom used in the time dependent problems the work of liu and lu 2010 is an example which applied the penalty method to count for earthquake base excitation in seismic analysis of structures scovazzi et al 2017 proposed an interesting approach which not only achieves accurate velocity as well as stresses but accommodates easily with enforced velocity and stress boundary conditions their equation of motion is expressed in terms of the first order time derivatives of stresses and velocities the structural dynamic analysis of an 11 meter zodiac h1110 2005 rigid inflatable boat rib under a slamming event will be investigated here this is done by adopting the enforced motion analysis capability provided by the commercially available finite element analysis software nd patran and nastran which is built upon the elimination approach 2010 to handle single point acceleration constraints the report of this investigation is organized and grouped into four sections methods and materials full boat validation accelerometer placement and substructure application section 2 covers the methods and materials employed in this study this section is made of three sub sections section 2 1 briefly outlines the derivation of the equation of motion subjected to pointwise acceleration constraints this constrained dynamic equation forms the mathematical base for structural dynamic analysis under enforced excitation the required input variables for solving the derived equation of motion are the finite element data of the 11 meter rib of concern and the acceleration data collected during the sea trials of the same boat the details of the former are presented in section 2 2 and the latter in section 2 3 section 3 reports the validation process which is done by taking advantage of the commercially rated nastran software to perform the enforced structural dynamic analysis of the 11 meter rib pointwise acceleration profiles collected from eleven accelerometers during sea trials are filtered and prepared as input for these dynamic analyses the proposed enforced base excitation method was then validated by comparing the simulated acceleration output with the associated data collected at three above deck accelerometers from sea trials section 4 investigates the effects of the placement and the number of input accelerometers on the accuracy of numerical simulation it is followed by section 5 where the dynamic analysis of the pilot cabin is conducted the pilot cabin is separated from the hull boat as an isolated substructure the acceleration profiles are enforced at the selected 7 points located at the base of the pilot cabin values of these 7 input acceleration profiles are taken from the numerical simulation of the full boat analysis section 6 is the final section which concludes this study with conclusion remarks and suggestions for future study 2 methods and materials the first part of this section presents the detailed derivation of the equation of motion associated with base excitation the equation of motion is derived based upon the framework of constrained dynamics haug 1989 1992 this theoretical formulation serves as the foundation for dynamic analysis subjected to enforced acceleration the input data required for solving the derived equation of motion include the stiffness and mass matrices of the structure and the pointwise acceleration data for base excitation the second part of this section describes the finite element model of the 11 meter rib corbishdale 2014 which is the application focus of this study the last part of this section describes the acceleration data extraction process this is done with the help of a matlab code standard g murphy and planchak 2015 this code takes the acceleration data as input filters out the high frequency noise caused by vibration and uses a peak identification algorithm to count the number of peaks the model algorithm and data they provided were essential in the dynamic response analysis of the rib 2 1 equation of motion under base excitation the equation of motion of a free flexible structure under the given loading p t can be described as 1 m x t c x t k x t p t where m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrices and p t and x t are the force and the displacement vectors respectively the displacement vector x t in eq 1 is unknown the above equation maybe simplified as m x t f t x x p t c x t k x t in the case of enforced motion a given subset of degrees of freedom of the system are subjected to enforced acceleration which can be viewed as constraints imposed upon the solution of eq 1 that is 2 m x t f t x x subject to x b a t where the displacement vector is divided into two parts prescribed or free x t x i x b in which x i denotes the degrees of freedom free of constraints while the acceleration associated with x b are prescribed by the given values a t it should be noted that eq 2 can be extended to cases with enforced displacements and velocities haug 1992 as the constraint is holonomic eq 2 can be augmented by introducing the lagrange multipliers λ as 3 m i i m i b 0 m b i m b b i 0 i 0 x i x b λ f i t x i x i x b x b f b t x i x i x b x b a t equation 3 is a dae index 3 system the constraint imposed on the system equation is holonomic and with one single degree of freedom 4 x b a t which can be directly integrated and result in the velocity and the position constrains with given initial velocity and position u 0 and u 0 as 5 x b a t u 0 x b 1 2 a t 2 u 0 t u 0 therefore the solution of eq 3 is not subjected to any hidden constraints on velocity and displacement the most convenient way to solve eq 3 is by direct substitution of eq 4 the resultant equations become 6 m i i 0 m b i i x i λ f i m i b a f b m b b a the first row of eq 6 is a typical ode which can be solved with help of eq 3 as 7 m i i x i f i t x i x i x b x b m i b x b f i t x i x i u 0 u 0 a m i b a which yields the solutions x i t and x i t these solutions can be substituted back to the second row of eq 6 to compute the lagrange multiplier as λ f b t x i x i x b x b m b i x b f b t x i x i u 0 u 0 a m b i x i m b b a or more specifically 8 λ f b t x i x i u 0 u 0 a m b i m i i 1 f i m b i m i i 1 m i b m b b a the lagrange multiplier represents in fact the constraint force required to enable the system to maintain the prescribed acceleration alternative forms of dynamic equations to express eq 2 are available and can be found in the literature for applications in earthquake analysis launching of space rocket and impact drop test cho et al 2016 flanigan 1994 bampton and craig 1968 blades and craig 1997 2 2 finite element model of the rib the finite element model of a zodiac h1110 rib 2005 was originally created by researchers in order to find the approximate ideal locations for the sensors through modal analysis corbishdale 2014 the total length of the boat is 10 82 m with a maximum beam width of 2 68 m the boat is mainly made of composite and aluminum further specifications of the boat can be found on the zodiac milpro website listed in the references at the end of this paper the finite element model of the boat as shown in figs 1 and 2 was originally built by the software femap the model is made of 50 732 nodes 211 beam 50 634 quadrilateral and 798 triangular elements a total of 45 rigid bars were used to connect key structural nodes on the boat to 4 372 lumped masses these lumped masses represented the motor aft fuel tanks inside the boat and aft facility mounts aft and forward and other onboard equipment the rigid bar elements are shown in the model figs 1 and 2 as purple lines and circles some of the other nodes in the images of the model are an orange color to represent nodes connected to smeared masses such as armor plating hatches windows radar and other equipment the finite element model was later imported to nd nastran and patran which is the finite element code used in this study the longitudinal center of gravity lcg of the physical boat as measured from the transom keel intersection was approximately 3 18 m with an uncertainty of approximately 0 872 the finite element model of the boat had its lcg located at approximately 3 43 m as measured from the transom keel intersection corbishdale 2014 this difference between the lcg locations on the physical boat and the finite element model is approximately 7 76 which is outside the uncertainty in the lcg measurement of the real world boat however the finite element model of the boat was given the same weight 15 320 lbs as its real world counterpart corbishdale 2014 it is also important to note that both the calm water and rough water trials were conducted with a weight of 15 845 lbs with the addition of crew seats ballast and instrumentation it had reduced fuel and the rack and bench were removed corbishdale 2014 this also changed the lcg of the physical boat from 3 18 m to 3 22 m from the transom keel intersection corbishdale 2014 the modal analysis of the rib boat was initially conducted by neinastran with three different sets of boundary conditions corbishdale 2014 one is done with no boundary conditions the others are done with 1 hz and 2 hz vertical spring constraints the spring constraints allow calculation of the percent modal mass of each elastic mode the modal analysis was then repeated with nd nastran for validation the averaged differences between the reported results and those obtained from nd nastran are 1 16 1 20 and 1 14 for all 200 modes respectively with free free 1 hz and 2 hz spring boundary conditions the highest error is 2 97 in mode 22 with free free boundary condition three example results of modal analysis with all three boundary conditions are reported in table 1 for both the reported and the newly obtained ones the primary hull bending mode is a global mode of interest and the seat pedestal box mode and the aft cabin panel modes are the local modes associated with the pilot cabin the percent modal masses of the global mode the seat pedestal box mode and the aft cabin panel mode are about 70 0 2 and 3 3 respectively 2 3 vertical acceleration data sea trials were conducted on an 11 meter rib to investigate wave impact phenomena murphy and planchak 2015 the sea trials covered a wide range of speeds and significant wave heights a total of 23 accelerometers were mounted around the boat to collect the acceleration data mainly associated with vertical motion the accelerometers were placed at the locations which are rigid and stiff to avoid the effects of flexible vibration although the finite element model was highly detailed it did not model all structural components with the same materials and properties as those in the physical rib as such only fourteen accelerometers are used in this study whose physical locations can be identified and associated with finite element nodal numbers eleven of them 1z 2z 3z 4z 6z 7z 8z 9z 11z 17z and 21z are selected for input of enforced excitation while three of the fourteen 10z 13z and 16z are for validation the locations of all said accelerometers are presented in figs 1 and 2 the vertical accelerometers are marked with red arrows in fig 1 while they are marked with red dots in fig 2 the accelerometers 1z 3z and 6z are all aligned with the centerline around the keel and 2z is also centered but placed in front of the engine box the accelerometers 4z and 7z are placed on the deck plate one is at transom and the other is in front of the pilot cabin the rest of the accelerometers are placed around the cabin the accelerometers 8z and 9z are placed respectively at the centerline and on the port side underneath the front bulkhead of the cabin the accelerometer 10z is centered on the deck plate inside the cabin and the accelerometer 11z is underneath the cabin door near the lcg the accelerometer 16z is on the cabin top while the accelerometers 13z 17z and 21z are all placed inside the cabin to measure the motions of the console and the seats on the port and starboard sides respectively two types of accelerometers were used silicon designs model 2260 025 and 2260 050 the sample rate of these accelerometers is set as 2000 per second in this study these accelerometers could measure acceleration along three coordinate axes and the positive coordinate directions are labeled on the accelerometer housings the accelerometers were mounted so that the positive z coordinate direction was pointed normal to the deck of the rib and skyward efforts were made to keep the boat as level as possible during the sea trials however in rougher seas it was much more difficult it is assumed in this study that the planing craft during the sea trials was not subjected to large angular rotation consequently the z direction of the accelerometers remains parallel during the simulation to the z direction of the global coordinate system which was the base in deriving the equation of motion eq 7 nine head sea run data are selected in this study their information is summarized in table 2 the data collected was categorized into three envelopes depending upon the conditions of head sea runs the top three runs listed in table 2 make up the constant speed envelope where the average craft speed was approximately the same over three different wave heights the middle three runs make up the constant wave height envelope where the significant wave heights were about the same over three different average craft speeds and the last three runs are where the rib was at or near the maximum safe speed for the boat operator in the given ocean conditions and make up the maximum safe speed envelope the maximum safe speed referred here was related to significant wave height after approximately 1 m in significant wave height the maximum speed of the boat had to be reduced in order to prevent risk of damage to the sensors and related equipment the boat and personnel in depth details of the data collection effort are presented in murphy and planchak 2015 the acceleration data collected from sea trials are the results of the combined rigid body motion and the flexible vibration to correlate the acceleration data with the impact force for a slamming event a standardized process riley et al 2010 2012 has been developed in order to extract the rigid body dominated acceleration data associated with an isolated slamming event the process first filters out the high frequency vibration modes and then sets up the amplitude and the time thresholds in order to identify the peaks of accelerations statistical terms of the collected peak acceleration data such as rms and the average of the highest one third or one tenth can then be quantified to estimate the static equivalent impact load a matlab code called the standard g riley and coats 2013 murphy and planchak 2015 developed based upon the described process was used in this study to filter out the acceleration data around a peak of acceleration 3 full boat validation the process begins with analysis of data collected during sea trials the raw data collected from the accelerometer 1z and the associated single sided amplitude spectrum are displayed in figs 3 and 4 as an example input and output of the standard g code fig 4 demonstrates that the dominated modes are below 10 hz as suggested by riley and coats 2012a b the low pass fourth order butterworth filter is then applied to the data set to remove the high frequency noise the filtered data forms the base for the peak acceleration and wave impact counts in order to obtain meaningful results with manageable simulation time and data storage space only one impact event is considered in this study for one specific sea trial run the specific impact event is selected based upon the data collected from 11z which is located near the lcg the highest peak of the acceleration is first identified a total of 2000 data points before and after the highest peak to cover a period of one second are then collected to form the data set of a single wave impact the data sets are all collected for the rest of 13 accelerometers with the same time frame as that of 11z this process is carried out for all seakeeping runs listed in table 2 the full boat dynamic analysis is conducted by nd nastran the detailed input commands and examples for enforced transient analysis can be found in nd nastran user manual 2010 the procedure is mainly centered on two key bulk data commands tload1 and lseq tload1 provides the time history of the excited force while lseq specifies the location where the excited force is imposed pamidi and reymond 2000 the type entry in tload1 is specified as acce so that the input data listed in table 1 is taken as an enforced acceleration the excited entry in tload1 is linked to the darea entry in lseq lseq on the other hand refers to the spcd command card to identify the nodal number where the excitation enforcement is imposed the same nodal number is also referred in the spc1 command card so that the node of concern and the associated degrees of freedom at which the acceleration is enforced can be treated as a single point boundary condition the entire simulation is done with a dell desktop model optiplex 990 due to the limit on memory only every fourth of the collected data are collected and included as input in the table 1 format this process is carried out for all 11 input acceleration data sets associated with 1z 2z 3z 4z 6z 7z 8z 9z 11z 17z and 21z limited by the simulation time and the computer memory only two sets of output at the selected nodes are reported in these simulation runs the nodal displacement and the nodal acceleration the sample snapshots of the motion profile of the boat during one second of a wave impact period are presented in fig 5 for the subcase 3 seakeeping run in the constant speed envelope the colors in the figures range from red to blue denoting the magnitudes of the point displacements from high to low the dark blue mesh indicates the initial position of the vessel which starts with zero displacement and zero velocity particularly fig 6 shows two different views of the instantaneous deformation of the entire boat at time 0 31 s which is at the acceleration peak during the constant speed subcase 3 seakeeping run it can be observed that the boat heaves and pitches during this wave impact event the nastran acceleration data at 10z 13z and 16z are output specifically for comparison purpose with the filtered raw data figs 7 9 display the nastran output data filtered at 10 hz alongside with the full boat raw data filtered also at 10 hz for all three seakeeping envelopes each of which has three subcases the speeds of the vessels and wave conditions of these envelopes and subcases can be found in table 2 the simulation results match well with the raw data in the high and smooth acceleration regions also note that the simulation generates high frequency oscillation after the impact which is not found in the filtered raw data this is particularly evident at the accelerometer 16z which is mounted on the top of the pilot cabin far away from the keel of the boat to better quantify the difference between the raw data and the simulation output the root mean square deviation rmsd and the normalized rmsd are calculated for each of the subcases the results are tabulated in table 3 let the error ε i at the ith time instance be defined as the difference between the filtered sea trial acceleration data a i e x p and the filtered nastran output a i s i m that is 9 ε i a i e x p a i s i m based on eq 9 the rmsd is obtained for n total number of samples r m s d i 1 n ε i 2 n while the normalized rmsd represents the percentage deviation relative to the range of the given data set n o r m a l i z e d r m s d r m s d a i m a x e x p a i m i n e x p data in table 3 reveal that subcase 2 of the constant speed envelope has the highest percentage error among all subcases while subcase 2 of the constant wave height envelope has the lowest percentage error the maximal acceleration of the former is lower than 2 46 g while that of the latter is greater than 6 48 g this observation implies that the acceleration enforced dynamic simulation achieves better accuracy with higher peak acceleration impact it is also interesting to notice that among all output accelerometers 10z 13z and 16z the simulation data at 16z produces the most accurate results the latter observation could be the result of the fact that 16z is mounted at the top of the pilot cabin farthest away from the keel of the boat the elasticity of the vessel structure softens the impact of rigid modes on acceleration while promoting local low amplitude vibration after impact in fact fig 7 through 9 appear to support this conclusion based on the higher acceleration frequency of 16z in the unfiltered data as compared to the acceleration frequency of 10z and 13z 4 placement of accelerometers in the enforced excitation the input pointwise accelerations are viewed as the impact forces most of the 11 accelerometers selected as input for dynamic modeling are placed along the centerline and in the lower deck near the keel except 3 accelerometers 9z 17z and 21z as shown in fig 2 all these three are placed at the base of the pilot cabin the accelerometers 17z and 21z are symmetrically placed along the centerline 17z is on the port side while 21z is on the starboard the accelerometer 9z is placed on the port side underneath the front bulkhead of the pilot cabin the locations of these three accelerometers are far from the wet surface therefore their accelerometers may not directly relate to the wave impact forces rather they serve as the enforced adjustment this section first investigates the effects of these three off center acceleration enforcements on the accuracy of the output pointwise accelerations at 10z 13z and 16z it is then extended to include 4z and 8z in this study that are the accelerometers placed near the top deck note that the output accelerometers 10z 13z and 16z that are used for validation are placed along the centerline of the pilot cabin 10z is on the base 13z the front midsection and 16z the top of the pilot cabin the enforced dynamic simulations conducted in section 3 are repeated here with different sets of input enforced accelerations that selectively excluded those accelerometers placed off line or above deck height only subcase 3 of the constant speed envelope is selected as a demonstrative seakeeping run in this study the vessel in this case runs with an average speed of 20 3 knots and an average wave period 6 4 seconds the rmsd s and the associated normalized values of various scenarios with different sets of input accelerometers are summarized in table 4 along with the data of the original runs for comparison it is observed that removal of accelerometers involved 17z and 21z which are on the port side and the starboard respectively will reduce the accuracy of the dynamic responses at three selected output accelerometers which are mounted on the base the front and the top of the pilot cabin particularly large errors are observed at the output accelerometers 13z and 16z which are on the front console and on the top of the pilot cabin removal of the un symmetric accelerometer 9z alone doesn t affect the accuracy of the output accelerometers nor does removal of accelerometers 4z and 8z accelerometer 4z locates at the stern on the top surface right above 3z which is mounted on the keel accelerometer 8z is mounted on the base of the front bulkhead of the pilot cabin along the centerline as an example the acceleration output of the case with removal of 8z and 9z is plotted in fig 10 along with the sea trial raw data note that fig 7 c displays the initial acceleration responses without removing 8z and 9z from input data set in a summary two primary conclusions may be drawn from the study in this section one it is more important to place the enforced accelerometers along the keel or near to it than those high above it and two it is beneficial to place the input enforced accelerometers around the structural area of concern particularly if this area is flexible in this case these enforced accelerometers serve as constraints or adjustments rather than the representations of the input excitation forces 5 dynamic substructure analysis of the pilot cabin dynamic substructure analysis could be used to accomplish refined analysis without imposing a burden on computer resources in this study one will focus on the vibration characteristics of the pilot cabin which affects onboard instrument noise and crew comfortability while operating a rib the finite element model of the pilot cabin isolated from the main deck of the rib is shown in fig 11 the base of the pilot cabin is rectangular around 1 92 by 2 92 m 75 5 by 115 inches the dynamic analysis of the pilot cabin during a wave impact is carried out following the same acceleration enforcement procedure as presented before however in this case the input accelerations at the selected points on the base of the isolated pilot cabin are taken not from the sea trials but from the full boat dynamic analysis conducted in section 2 to this end it is necessary to select an appropriate set of input base excitation accelerations as well as their locations ideal locations for the input acceleration nodes are assumed to be at the top of bulkheads beneath the cabin for the rigidity of the bulkheads however in the current design the walls of the pilot cabin at its base are not aligned with the bulkhead intersections therefore the nodes on the base of the cabin that are closest to the intersections of the transverse and the longitudinal bulkheads are first selected as the cabin input acceleration three additional acceleration input nodes are then selected one is on the middle section along the port side of the pilot cabin another along the starboard and the other is at the center of the front bulkhead at the end seven acceleration input nodes in total are selected in this study the side view of the transverse bulkhead and the pilot cabin is shown in fig 12 while the locations of the seven input acceleration nodes are marked in fig 13 on the mesh model of the base of the pilot cabin note that like those in figs 1 and 2 the purple bars in figs 11 and 12 mark the rigid bar elements connecting lumped masses to the key structural nodes and the orange nodes are those with smeared masses next the acceleration data at the seven selected nodes are taken from the output of the full boat dynamic analysis filtered out at 10 hz and then input as the enforced base excitation for the dynamic analysis of the isolated pilot cabin model this is carried out only for subcase 3 seakeeping trial run of the constant speed envelope the output of acceleration data at 10z 13z and 16z mounted on the pilot cabin are selected and compared with the sea trial acceleration data as well as those out of the full boat dynamic analysis all these data are filtered out at 10 hz and displayed in fig 14 a it is evident that all three cases engage high local vibration after peak acceleration this is particularly significant in accelerometer 16z which is on the top of the pilot cabin this leads to the reinvestigation of the spectrum plot of the raw acceleration data at 16z fig 15 shows that the frequencies ranging between 9 and 12 hz do contribute significantly to the content of 16z acceleration in fact corbishdale 2014 reported in his full boat finite element modal analysis that significant local modes related to the pilot cabin are at 11 2 hz and 12 6 hz consequently the dynamic substructure analysis is repeated by filtering out the output of the full boat dynamic analysis at 13 hz before taking them as input to enforce excitation the newly obtained results are plotted in fig 14 b when filtered at a higher frequency more local vibration modes are observed due to the high frequency filtered enforced excitation results show that a 45 reduction in normalized rmsd from 0 0558 to 0 0306 is observed when filtered at 13 hz instead of 10 hz this example demonstrates that the dynamic analysis of a full boat with enforced acceleration can be successfully extended to an isolated substructure if the number and the location of the interface excitation nodes are properly selected this is done without any additional sea trial data as a final investigation the acceleration and the stress output around the seat pedestals are collected for the isolated pilot cabin all these results reported here are filtered at 13 hz the acceleration plots for the port seat pedestal and the starboard seat pedestal are summarized in fig 16 for a single wave impact it is interesting to notice that after peak impact both seat pedestals are subjected to around 8 hz of high acceleration repeated impact which are not noticeable in the output of all other accelerometers in this study this conclusion however is drawn only for subcase 3 sea trial of constant speed envelope due to the requirement of a large data storage space nastran is unable to report the stress time history for the full rib model as the size of the finite element model is reduced it is then feasible to report the stress contour time history of the entire isolated pilot cabin particularly the von mises stress histories during a wave impact at the port and the starboard seat pedestals are selected and plotted in fig 17 and the stress contour plots of the pilot cabin are reported at time 0 298 s and 0 458 s respectively in fig 18 the first plot in fig 18 a is associated with the first acceleration peak of the port seat pedestal at 0 298 s while the second plot in fig 18 b is with the second acceleration peak of the starboard seat pedestal at 0 458 s 6 conclusion and recommendations the development of methods and procedures to better understand the dynamic responses of high speed planing hulls to wave impacts is necessary in order to mitigate risk to crew and equipment in the current work the structure dynamic analysis of a high speed planing craft is completed by enforcing the collected pointwise acceleration data on a valid finite element model the thoughtfully built finite element model of a rib along with the acceleration data collected from sea trails are essential to facilitate this study the proposed method is validated by focusing on nine single wave impacts each of which is associated with one specific seakeeping condition selected from the available sea trial data the acceleration data acquired from 11 accelerometers placed inside the lower boat hull are selected as the input enforced acceleration while those collected from 3 accelerometers mounted on the top and the base of the pilot cabin are used to investigate the accuracy of the simulation the results demonstrate that the output of the proposed method matches well with those of sea trial data particularly the proposed method achieves higher accuracy for the higher peak acceleration case than for the lower ones for example the simulation achieves less than 7 3 error measured by the normalized rmsd for the seakeeping run with an average craft speed of 18 9 knots significant wave height 1 19 m and wave period of 5 6 s the peak acceleration in this case collected during sea trials ranges from 6 48 g to 7 39 g in the three output accelerometers mounted around the pilot cabin the high peak acceleration is usually a condition of major concern for design and operation of a high speed planing hull in the second phase of this study the issue about the number and the placement of input accelerometers is investigated the accelerometers aligned along the keel and near the bottom hull are found to be more important to the accuracy of the simulation than those away and off the centerline furthermore it is beneficial to place the input accelerometers around the base of the pilot cabin even though these accelerometers do not directly represent the impact load they are the constrained forces which adjust the solution of the substructure that is placed far away from the keel finally the enforced acceleration method is extended successfully to conduct the dynamic analysis of an isolated pilot cabin the input acceleration data set is selected from the output of the full boat numerical simulation to excite the pilot cabin this approach allows for more focused efficient and comprehensive substructure analysis which is needed for mounting instrument and crew seats onboard a high speed craft this paper represents an initial attempt to employ the base excitation method for dynamic analysis of a high speed craft with the enforced acceleration based upon the sea trial data this method is structure based doesn t involve computational fluid dynamics nor fluid structure interaction though the effects of structural damping and large pitching movement were not considered in this study the results of this study were validated satisfactorily it should be noticed that its success relies upon the accurate finite element model and the carefully filtered acceleration data the successful demonstration presented in this paper has opened a door for more broad investigation of the proposed method one is to calculate the constraint loads λ in eq 8 which are the ones to enforce the prescribed motion the magnitudes of λ could be useful to correlate the pressure load distribution to acceleration and provide an insight into selecting proper locations to place accelerometers the other is to extend the method to simulate a planing hull operated under large pitching and yawing conditions in these cases additional sensor data such as those collected from imu 3 axis accelerometers and strain gauges may be used for further enforcement and validation acknowledgements this research was partially funded by the naval

for the existing monopile foundations therefore a prefabricated footing plate can be applied to provide additional horizontal bearing capacity of the structure hybrid pile foundations were first used to build embedded retaining walls along wide traffic roads positioned in excavations powrie chandler 1998 powrie et al 1999 watson carder 1994 the idea was to take into account the pile cap and soil pile interaction the footing plate the pile cap was made below the excavation s bottom level experimental evaluations of lateral load resistance of pile caps were made at full scale in 1970 duncan and mokwa 2001 kim et al 1979a 1979b mokwa and duncan 2001 2003 rollins and cole 2006 results of laboratory tests and analyses of retaining walls with cantilever plates were reported by powrie richards et al 2004 powrie daly 2007 scientific discussion was focused only on the ultimate limit state of the retaining wall carder et al 1999 at the same time a number of similar concepts of hybrid foundations for offshore structures have been studied in various research centers arshi 2016 el marassi 2011 pedram 2015b wang 2017 stone et al 2010a b lehane et al 2014 trojnar 1997 conducted preliminary assessment research on increasing the lateral stiffness of large diameter rc hybrid piles in bridge supports tests were conducted in natural scale on a special test stand with lateral load trojnar 2013 maharaj 2003 and mahiyar patel 2000 analyzed various numerical models of hybrid foundations taking into account the influence of the l b ratio 0 25 5 hybrid pile resistance was found to depend mainly on the geometry of a hybrid foundation system especially the pile length to footing width ratio a series of centrifuge model tests of hybrid monopiles has been conducted recently it was demonstrated that the hybrid foundation system did show advantages under lateral load behaviors centrifuge tests by arshi 2011 arshi stone 2011 on a 0 95 m diameter pile combined with a steel circular footing of 5 m in diameter at a prototype scale reported an increase in the lateral pile capacity in sand the 1 g model tests conducted by arshi et al 2013 also indicated that the addition of 80 mm diameter steel footings increased the lateral pile capacity in sand by approximately 50 relative to capacity of the single pile similarly centrifuge tests and fe analyses by lehane et al 2014 indicated that at prototype scale a steel footing 17 5 m in diameter when used in combination with a 3 3 m diameter monopile in sand led to almost a doubling of the lateral pile capacity all centrifuge test results and the corresponding fe back analyses show considerable benefits of the use of a circular footing plate in combination with a pile to resist moment loading also the soil beneath the footing plate was found to be displaced in front of the monopile and provided some passive earth pressure on the pile during the tests numerical analysis by stone et al stone et al 2018 zdravković et al 2015 and pedram 2015a 2015c 2018 captured general mechanisms of both coupled and decoupled systems providing sufficient consistency with test results but only as regards experiments in the laboratory scale in particular the fe analysis of the coupled hybrid system demonstrated the development of high stress in the ground caused by rotation of the plate el marassi 2011 and cheng gaudin casidy cheng et al 2019 have developed and implemented comprehensive research programs for hybrid foundation systems the behavior of the hybrid systems in different combined loads v h m was analyzed the numerical study indicated that taking into account the interaction between the three elements of the hybrid system plate soil monopile influences the increase of its load capacity and lateral stiffness even at low strains these studies indicate promising results although they are limited to steel footings and relatively small steel pile models in centrifuge tests this paper extends studies on hybrid monopiles by examining the benefits of using reinforced concrete rc footings in conjunction with full scale large diameter rc piles in sand using field investigations in real ground conditions a 3d numerical analysis of the soil deformation near the hybrid pile in sand was also carried out the results were calibrated on the basis of own tests and field measurements made in real conditions 2 multi scale model tests 2 1 small scale tests model tests were conducted at the rzeszów university of technology poland using a special geotechnical stand the central part of the stand holds a box 2 m long x 1 m high and 1 m wide filled with model soil fig 2 the front wall of the box is transparent to allow observation of the behavior of the ground near the foundation model under load dry fine sand was used as model soil the soil parameters are shown in table 1 the box was filled with sand using the curtain method from a container moving at a constant height to provide uniform compaction conditions the inside of the box was lined with hdpe foil 0 15 mm thick in order to reduce friction of the model sand on back and sides of the box during its filling for humidity protection the large dimensions of the box did not affect the boundary conditions of the model test colored layers or checkpoints were used in the sand placed in the box for better observation of models of foundations and soil through the transparent box wall the models had a width of d 0 2 m and were made of 10 mm thick steel sheet the vertical shafts of the models were set in the ground to a depth of l 0 3 m and 0 6 m respectively and equipped with horizontal cantilever plates with a range of b 2 0 2 m in the soil level the geometric scaling law 1 n 10 was applied in model tests length of the model corresponded to the pile length l 3 m and 6 m in prototype scale of the later field tests carried out 5 m long pile a hybrid foundation model was subjected to horizontal force 0 2 kn in reduced scale 1 n2 100 compared to the field tests of piles until the ultimate limit state in the ground was obtained baguelin et al 1977 bolton 1986 stone wood 1992 the aim of the tests was to qualitatively assess the behavior of the soil under the plate in front of a hybrid pile for load scheme m h in each test the plate was resting on equally compacted sand the foundation models were loaded with a horizontal force h applied at 0 3 m above the sand level in the box resulting in an m h load scheme in the pile head during the loading the view behind the transparent box wall and the shape of the body of soil pushed upwards in the box were recorded based on these observations significant differences in the behavior of models were found depending on the depth of their immersion in the soil characteristic shapes of active zones of the soil in front of two foundation models are shown in fig 3 in the case of the short model of length l 0 3 m a shallow soil displacement zone in front of the plate and an active area in the corner between the plate and the pile in the examination of the model with the shaft of twice the length l 0 6 m the active area along the pile was visibly larger and the displacement zone in front of the plate reached deeper fig 4 shows the extent of displaced soil visible on the surface near both models in the case of the model with a short shaft of length l 0 3 m the change of extent of the soil displacement zone at the beginning and at the end of loading was small a much bigger change in the soil displacement zone was observed during loading of the model with the long shaft of l 0 6 m in this case the soil was displaced both in the direction of the load applied and in the lateral zones of the model fig 5 shows the locations of momentary rotation points in the soil for both models under load the higher the lateral load became the momentary rotation point moved further away from the pile for the model with the long shaft the location of the rotation point in the soil became lower whereas for the short shaft model the rotation occurred at the same depth 2 2 full scale tests full scale tests were performed at the rzeszów university of technology poland two 5 m long 1 2 m diameter bored cast in place reinforced concrete piles with permanent steel casing were made after six months lateral load was simultaneously applied on two hybrid monopiles with plates and two standard piles without plates this allowed a direct comparison of the deflections of piles operating in identical conditions the tests were carried out for lateral load applied to the piles horizontally at 4 m of height load scheme m h and near the ground surface load scheme h the data collected allowed the assessment of the effect of the footing plate on the lateral stiffness of a hybrid monopile and enabled defining real soil pile interaction in both schemes stability of large diameter piles models of the monopiles was analyzed on the basis of plots showing the relation of the pile deflection at the ground surface lateral displacement to the lateral load the field test results were used for drawing conclusions with regard to the effectiveness of the soil plate interaction and the stability of laterally loaded hybrid monopiles in real cohesionless soils the distance between the pile axes was 5 m the geotechnical conditions are shown in table 2 the subsoil consists of a 13 m thick layer of fine sand the cone penetration test cpt and the dilatometric test dmt were used to describe the geotechnical parameters of the fine sand the investigation results are shown in figs 6 and 7 monopiles were extended to about 5 m over the ground with i section steel columns whose 3 m long bottom sections were embedded in the piles at the ground surface outside both piles cantilever rc plates were made rigidly connected with the pile heads the test system of the hybrid monopiles and the shape of the footing plate are shown in fig 8 the cantilever rc plates rigidly connected with the piles were trapezium shaped with their shorter sides connected to the pile heads the dimensions of the plate were adjusted to the passive zone of the ground which could be seen in front of a pile under a lateral load in the ultimate limit state of the ground in laboratory tests trojnar 2008a zhang et al 2005 the assumed reach of the cantilever plate was 1 8 m 1 5 d its width at the end of the cantilever being 3 m 2 5 d and its thickness 0 5 m the proportion l b 1 4 of main dimensions of the hybrid monopile in the field investigation has similar value to that in the tests conducted by other authors stone et al 2007 2010a b the plates were made on a special controlled compacted sand layer 0 6 m thick e 20 mpa and 80 mpa measurements of the sand deformability was made after concreting of cantilever plate using plate loading test plt the plt test consisted in loading a steel plate having 300 mm in diameter previously placed under an rc plate with a through hole trojnar 2004 2010 due to simultaneous bending of two piles while dragging or pushing them together the deflections of the hybrid piles with plates or the standard ones without plates could be directly compared the lateral loading of the piles was conducted in four stages the applied force variants and load schemes are shown in table 3 the various horizontal force level variants allowed estimation of the reaction of the piles under high force and bending moment forces h1 h2 applied 4 2 m above the ground surface as well as under high horizontal force with low bending moment forces h3 h4 applied at the height of 0 2 m above the ground in stage 1 the hybrid monopiles were loaded up to their design capacity and unloaded in stage 2 piles were loaded again as the standard ones after two weeks when the standard piles were loaded with a horizontal force h2 applied high above the ground the relieving effect of the back plate was small in stages 3 and 4 when hybrid piles were loaded near ground level forces h3 h4 the friction effect of the back plate was important so the piles were tested using half circular plate b 2 and twins plates b the load applied was increased until the ultimate bearing capacity of the soil was reached during each stage the loads were applied gradually and each step continued until displacements stabilized the measurements were made after each load increment and after unloading the piles while comparing the deflections and rotation of the pile heads the flexible deformation effects of the steel i section were taken into account due to their being bent above the ground load was applied to the piles with hydraulic jacks a clamp made of steel sections was used for pushing the piles together during the dragging stage two hydraulic jacks and a strut made of a piece of a 200 mm diameter steel pipe were placed between the i sections fig 9 shows displacement measurements for hybrid and standard monopiles in stages 1 and 2 with regard to lateral load values fig 10 shows a comparison of displacement in 5 m long hybrid and standard monopiles with correction effects of the testing sequence the effect of the application of a footing plate in the hybrid monopile was a reduction of the displacement compared to that of a standard monopile the effect of the plate increased with the plate s rotation causing passive earth pressure in front of the pile fig 11 shows displacement measurements for hybrid and standard monopiles in stage 3 with horizontal force applied near the ground level fig 12 shows a comparison of displacements of the hybrid monopiles with various footing plates b 2 and b with correction effects in consecutive testing sequences stages 3 4 other studies wang et al 2018b already identified the effect of friction between the ground and the bottom of the plate however no full scale investigations of hybrid piles with measurement of permanent displacements after their unloading were carried out the results of the displacement in the field tests are presented in table 4 as shown in fig 13 a for the load scheme m h the value of the permanent total displacement ratio for hybrid and standard piles is similar for the load scheme h fig 13b the value of this ratio is significantly higher more than two times for a hybrid pile regardless of the type plates b 2 and b the friction under the plate is important especially when the hybrid piles are unloaded however the limited number of tests performed in real scale does not allow this issue to be discussed the use of skirted footing plates with grouting may be an interesting solution to reduce the permanent displacement of hybrid piles stone et al 2007 haiderali and madabhushi 2015 cheng et al 2019 2 3 numerical model validation numerical modelling was carried out using the finite element method and the plaxis 3d foundation software the analysis was conducted for a monopile of 1 2 m in diameter in homogenous sand the mohr coulomb nonlinear elastic plastic model of soil was used kim jeong 2011 the following sand parameters were used for mes calculations internal friction angle φ 35o young s modulus variants e 20 mpa 80 mpa increased 1 5z with depth z cohesion c 0 001 mpa poisson s ratio ʋ 0 30 and dilatation angle 5o while calculating the displacements and strains in the soil in the 3d setup consecutive stages of applying load to piles were simulated the assumed 3d numerical model of the hybrid monopile consists of over 33 000 elements and more than 89 000 nodes it was built of 15 node solid elements each containing 6 gauss points the dimensions of the model of the hybrid monopile were the same as of the piles in field investigation trojnar 2008b the numerical model of monopile was subjected to validation in view of adapting it to the field investigation conditions and the computation results were referred to the approximation of displacements of the standard pile on fig 14 achmus et al 2009 lesny et al 2007 pedram 2015a trojnar 2008b the application of the 3d fe analysis for the hybrid monopile allowed obtaining a great deal of information about the processes occurring in the subsoil around the pile the numerical analysis was used to qualitatively identify the behavior of the ground around the hybrid monopile and to develop a practical method for its calculation in the future fan long 2005 byrne et al 2017 3 hybrid monopile stiffness evaluation 3 1 small scale test results fig 15 shows the characteristic layout of the soil in front of the hybrid foundation due to the horizontal displacement and the rotation of the foundation model a passive zone a wedge shaped and tapering downward was formed underneath the plate three dimensional stress occurred in this zone caused by simultaneous action of the pile and the plate zone a caused stiffening of the hybrid foundation in the soil an increase of three dimensional interaction and a reduced bending of the pile zone b lies to the right with the peak pointing upwards this is where occurrence of momentary rotation points was observed directly in front of the plate is the displacement zone c also visible on the soil surface the extent and shapes of all zones changed alongside with increasing the horizontal load in the finite limit state of the subsoil shearing of the ground occurred between zones between a and b the shearing plane slanted from the perpendicular at angle β corresponding to the value of the angle of internal friction of sand used in model tests φ 30 based on model tests at small scale it was shown that hybrid foundations interact with the soil differently from standard piles loaded horizontally the horizontal plate fixed to the pile decreases the displacement of the foundation and enhances its three dimensional interaction with the soil results of model tests 1 g confirmed that the effectiveness of limiting the horizontal displacement of the hybrid pile depends on the pile length conclusions from the qualitative examination of the soil behavior around a hybrid foundation were used in the further part of the paper preparing a numeric model of the hybrid foundation 3 2 full scale test results fig 16 presents the plots of the dependence of the ep coefficient on the lateral load on a monopile of 1 2 m in diameter in sand the value of the ep is described as a ratio of the standard pile displacement to the hybrid pile displacement under the same lateral load which was assumed as a measure of the plate effect the ep parameter defined in this way characterizes the plate s influence on the lateral stiffness of a hybrid monopile based on the field investigation results a comparative analysis of the deflections of hybrid and standard monopiles was conducted within the range of load values applied during particular investigation stages the analysis ignored the responses of the monopiles at the initial load stage 0 60 kn because the scatter of the results resulted from initially different density of the soil under the plates of the two tested piles during the two stages of loading the effectiveness of the plate was 1 7 and is consistent with the results of centrifuge model tests conducted by other authors el marassi et al 2008 stone et al 2018 the values above 1 0 mean that the deflection of the hybrid monopile was smaller than that of a standard one the increase in lateral load was accompanied by a gradual increase in the effectiveness of the plates the activity differences between the plate effect ep at the first and the second loading stage 1 2 follow first of all from the different modulus of deformation of the sand control compacted layer surface under the plate it can be seen that at the reloading of the two piles stage 2 within the load range of the previous test stage 1 a change in the monotonic of the effectiveness curve of the plates occurred in this case the values of the ep parameter were greater than in the previous investigation despite lower lateral load values at the same time it is clear that at a pile reloading stage 2 the ep curve decreases monotonically and asymptotically approaches the values obtained in the previous test stage 1 at a pile load above 300 kn the plate effect remained at the same level fig 17 shows the approximate values of the ep coefficient for a hybrid monopile with a plate resting on compacted sand with different values of the young s modulus e 80 mpa and 20 mpa 3 3 results of 3d fe analysis the lateral load on the numerical model monopile was 500 kn it was applied to the pile at 4 m over the ground surface as in the field investigation fig 18 shows comparison of shapes of soil strain fields in the area around two numerical models of 5 m long piles a hybrid one and a standard one the results presented are for successive stages causing the following pile head displacements 10 mm 20 mm and 40 mm respectively the 3d fe analysis allowed a better understanding of the soil and hybrid monopile interactions the lateral load of the monopile assumed for the calculations allowed precise analysis of its behavior in the displacement range of up to 60 mm fig 19 shows shapes of strain fields and zones on the surface of the ground around two monopiles a standard one and a hybrid one at their lateral displacement 10 20 and 40 mm the results of numerical fe calculations are qualitatively similar to those obtained in small scale model tests 1 g as regards the range of compared load values applied in the field investigation and the 3d fe analysis the computed lateral displacements were basically consistent with those measured figs 20 and 21 show calculated values of stresses and displacements of hybrid monopiles below ground level and differences in stress distribution in front of standard and hybrid monopiles with the same lateral load the displacement of the hybrid monopile head is four times smaller than in the case of the standard monopile within the range of loads corresponding to field examinations the maximum strain on the ground of a 5 m hybrid monopile is 25 smaller compared to that of a standard monopile the difference of horizontal stress in the ground indicates that the range of beneficial effect of a foundation plate in field examination conditions was 1 5 m beneath the plate which corresponds to 40 of the monopile length by the use of a coupled plate rigidly connected with the pile the ground in front of a hybrid monopile has higher bearing capacity than in the case of a standard monopile 4 conclusions the effect of the work presented is an explanation of the phenomena occurring in cohesionless soil around hybrid monopiles the behavior of such new foundations in the 3d soil foundation interaction system is described the small scale tests full scale field investigations and numerical 3d analysis of hybrid monopiles show greater lateral stiffness in the ground due to the effective interaction between the monopile the footing plate and the soil within the examined range of displacement caused by test load lateral load on the hybrid monopile activates an additional reaction of the substrate which has a positive effect on limiting the bending of the pile in the soil based on the results of tests and analyses carried out in various scales and based on computational analyses for full size piles with a diameter of 1 2 m the following conclusions can be drawn 1 hybrid piles show greater lateral stiffness in the ground due to the effectiveness of the vertical shaft the horizontal plate and soil within a definite range of displacement of up to 40 mm caused by lateral load 2 when the hybrid piles embedded in cohesionless soil were subjected to horizontal force and bending moment their deflections were smaller than those of the standard piles depending on the plate subsoil deformability and the length of the pile in the case of investigated hybrid monopiles with a diameter of 1 2 m the plate effect rose gradually at a displacement range of 2 10 mm to stabilize under a load greater than 300 kn at 1 7 for 5 m long monopiles 3 field tests show that the impact of friction under the plate is important when hybrid monopiles are unloaded for the lateral load by horizontal force near the ground surface with low bending moment the value of permanent displacement of the pile head after unloading is two times higher than in the case of a standard pile 4 the reduction of hybrid monopile deflection observed during field tests shows an increase in monopile and soil stiffness in the upper segment of a 5 m hybrid monopile to a depth of 1 5 m below the footing plate

for offshore structures have been studied in various research centers arshi 2016 el marassi 2011 pedram 2015b wang 2017 stone et al 2010a b lehane et al 2014 trojnar 1997 conducted preliminary assessment research on increasing the lateral stiffness of large diameter rc hybrid piles in bridge supports tests were conducted in natural scale on a special test stand with lateral load trojnar 2013 maharaj 2003 and mahiyar patel 2000 analyzed various numerical models of hybrid foundations taking into account the influence of the l b ratio 0 25 5 hybrid pile resistance was found to depend mainly on the geometry of a hybrid foundation system especially the pile length to footing width ratio a series of centrifuge model tests of hybrid monopiles has been conducted recently it was demonstrated that the hybrid foundation system did show advantages under lateral load behaviors centrifuge tests by arshi 2011 arshi stone 2011 on a 0 95 m diameter pile combined with a steel circular footing of 5 m in diameter at a prototype scale reported an increase in the lateral pile capacity in sand the 1 g model tests conducted by arshi et al 2013 also indicated that the addition of 80 mm diameter steel footings increased the lateral pile capacity in sand by approximately 50 relative to capacity of the single pile similarly centrifuge tests and fe analyses by lehane et al 2014 indicated that at prototype scale a steel footing 17 5 m in diameter when used in combination with a 3 3 m diameter monopile in sand led to almost a doubling of the lateral pile capacity all centrifuge test results and the corresponding fe back analyses show considerable benefits of the use of a circular footing plate in combination with a pile to resist moment loading also the soil beneath the footing plate was found to be displaced in front of the monopile and provided some passive earth pressure on the pile during the tests numerical analysis by stone et al stone et al 2018 zdravković et al 2015 and pedram 2015a 2015c 2018 captured general mechanisms of both coupled and decoupled systems providing sufficient consistency with test results but only as regards experiments in the laboratory scale in particular the fe analysis of the coupled hybrid system demonstrated the development of high stress in the ground caused by rotation of the plate el marassi 2011 and cheng gaudin casidy cheng et al 2019 have developed and implemented comprehensive research programs for hybrid foundation systems the behavior of the hybrid systems in different combined loads v h m was analyzed the numerical study indicated that taking into account the interaction between the three elements of the hybrid system plate soil monopile influences the increase of its load capacity and lateral stiffness even at low strains these studies indicate promising results although they are limited to steel footings and relatively small steel pile models in centrifuge tests this paper extends studies on hybrid monopiles by examining the benefits of using reinforced concrete rc footings in conjunction with full scale large diameter rc piles in sand using field investigations in real ground conditions a 3d numerical analysis of the soil deformation near the hybrid pile in sand was also carried out the results were calibrated on the basis of own tests and field measurements made in real conditions 2 multi scale model tests 2 1 small scale tests model tests were conducted at the rzeszów university of technology poland using a special geotechnical stand the central part of the stand holds a box 2 m long x 1 m high and 1 m wide filled with model soil fig 2 the front wall of the box is transparent to allow observation of the behavior of the ground near the foundation model under load dry fine sand was used as model soil the soil parameters are shown in table 1 the box was filled with sand using the curtain method from a container moving at a constant height to provide uniform compaction conditions the inside of the box was lined with hdpe foil 0 15 mm thick in order to reduce friction of the model sand on back and sides of the box during its filling for humidity protection the large dimensions of the box did not affect the boundary conditions of the model test colored layers or checkpoints were used in the sand placed in the box for better observation of models of foundations and soil through the transparent box wall the models had a width of d 0 2 m and were made of 10 mm thick steel sheet the vertical shafts of the models were set in the ground to a depth of l 0 3 m and 0 6 m respectively and equipped with horizontal cantilever plates with a range of b 2 0 2 m in the soil level the geometric scaling law 1 n 10 was applied in model tests length of the model corresponded to the pile length l 3 m and 6 m in prototype scale of the later field tests carried out 5 m long pile a hybrid foundation model was subjected to horizontal force 0 2 kn in reduced scale 1 n2 100 compared to the field tests of piles until the ultimate limit state in the ground was obtained baguelin et al 1977 bolton 1986 stone wood 1992 the aim of the tests was to qualitatively assess the behavior of the soil under the plate in front of a hybrid pile for load scheme m h in each test the plate was resting on equally compacted sand the foundation models were loaded with a horizontal force h applied at 0 3 m above the sand level in the box resulting in an m h load scheme in the pile head during the loading the view behind the transparent box wall and the shape of the body of soil pushed upwards in the box were recorded based on these observations significant differences in the behavior of models were found depending on the depth of their immersion in the soil characteristic shapes of active zones of the soil in front of two foundation models are shown in fig 3 in the case of the short model of length l 0 3 m a shallow soil displacement zone in front of the plate and an active area in the corner between the plate and the pile in the examination of the model with the shaft of twice the length l 0 6 m the active area along the pile was visibly larger and the displacement zone in front of the plate reached deeper fig 4 shows the extent of displaced soil visible on the surface near both models in the case of the model with a short shaft of length l 0 3 m the change of extent of the soil displacement zone at the beginning and at the end of loading was small a much bigger change in the soil displacement zone was observed during loading of the model with the long shaft of l 0 6 m in this case the soil was displaced both in the direction of the load applied and in the lateral zones of the model fig 5 shows the locations of momentary rotation points in the soil for both models under load the higher the lateral load became the momentary rotation point moved further away from the pile for the model with the long shaft the location of the rotation point in the soil became lower whereas for the short shaft model the rotation occurred at the same depth 2 2 full scale tests full scale tests were performed at the rzeszów university of technology poland two 5 m long 1 2 m diameter bored cast in place reinforced concrete piles with permanent steel casing were made after six months lateral load was simultaneously applied on two hybrid monopiles with plates and two standard piles without plates this allowed a direct comparison of the deflections of piles operating in identical conditions the tests were carried out for lateral load applied to the piles horizontally at 4 m of height load scheme m h and near the ground surface load scheme h the data collected allowed the assessment of the effect of the footing plate on the lateral stiffness of a hybrid monopile and enabled defining real soil pile interaction in both schemes stability of large diameter piles models of the monopiles was analyzed on the basis of plots showing the relation of the pile deflection at the ground surface lateral displacement to the lateral load the field test results were used for drawing conclusions with regard to the effectiveness of the soil plate interaction and the stability of laterally loaded hybrid monopiles in real cohesionless soils the distance between the pile axes was 5 m the geotechnical conditions are shown in table 2 the subsoil consists of a 13 m thick layer of fine sand the cone penetration test cpt and the dilatometric test dmt were used to describe the geotechnical parameters of the fine sand the investigation results are shown in figs 6 and 7 monopiles were extended to about 5 m over the ground with i section steel columns whose 3 m long bottom sections were embedded in the piles at the ground surface outside both piles cantilever rc plates were made rigidly connected with the pile heads the test system of the hybrid monopiles and the shape of the footing plate are shown in fig 8 the cantilever rc plates rigidly connected with the piles were trapezium shaped with their shorter sides connected to the pile heads the dimensions of the plate were adjusted to the passive zone of the ground which could be seen in front of a pile under a lateral load in the ultimate limit state of the ground in laboratory tests trojnar 2008a zhang et al 2005 the assumed reach of the cantilever plate was 1 8 m 1 5 d its width at the end of the cantilever being 3 m 2 5 d and its thickness 0 5 m the proportion l b 1 4 of main dimensions of the hybrid monopile in the field investigation has similar value to that in the tests conducted by other authors stone et al 2007 2010a b the plates were made on a special controlled compacted sand layer 0 6 m thick e 20 mpa and 80 mpa measurements of the sand deformability was made after concreting of cantilever plate using plate loading test plt the plt test consisted in loading a steel plate having 300 mm in diameter previously placed under an rc plate with a through hole trojnar 2004 2010 due to simultaneous bending of two piles while dragging or pushing them together the deflections of the hybrid piles with plates or the standard ones without plates could be directly compared the lateral loading of the piles was conducted in four stages the applied force variants and load schemes are shown in table 3 the various horizontal force level variants allowed estimation of the reaction of the piles under high force and bending moment forces h1 h2 applied 4 2 m above the ground surface as well as under high horizontal force with low bending moment forces h3 h4 applied at the height of 0 2 m above the ground in stage 1 the hybrid monopiles were loaded up to their design capacity and unloaded in stage 2 piles were loaded again as the standard ones after two weeks when the standard piles were loaded with a horizontal force h2 applied high above the ground the relieving effect of the back plate was small in stages 3 and 4 when hybrid piles were loaded near ground level forces h3 h4 the friction effect of the back plate was important so the piles were tested using half circular plate b 2 and twins plates b the load applied was increased until the ultimate bearing capacity of the soil was reached during each stage the loads were applied gradually and each step continued until displacements stabilized the measurements were made after each load increment and after unloading the piles while comparing the deflections and rotation of the pile heads the flexible deformation effects of the steel i section were taken into account due to their being bent above the ground load was applied to the piles with hydraulic jacks a clamp made of steel sections was used for pushing the piles together during the dragging stage two hydraulic jacks and a strut made of a piece of a 200 mm diameter steel pipe were placed between the i sections fig 9 shows displacement measurements for hybrid and standard monopiles in stages 1 and 2 with regard to lateral load values fig 10 shows a comparison of displacement in 5 m long hybrid and standard monopiles with correction effects of the testing sequence the effect of the application of a footing plate in the hybrid monopile was a reduction of the displacement compared to that of a standard monopile the effect of the plate increased with the plate s rotation causing passive earth pressure in front of the pile fig 11 shows displacement measurements for hybrid and standard monopiles in stage 3 with horizontal force applied near the ground level fig 12 shows a comparison of displacements of the hybrid monopiles with various footing plates b 2 and b with correction effects in consecutive testing sequences stages 3 4 other studies wang et al 2018b already identified the effect of friction between the ground and the bottom of the plate however no full scale investigations of hybrid piles with measurement of permanent displacements after their unloading were carried out the results of the displacement in the field tests are presented in table 4 as shown in fig 13 a for the load scheme m h the value of the permanent total displacement ratio for hybrid and standard piles is similar for the load scheme h fig 13b the value of this ratio is significantly higher more than two times for a hybrid pile regardless of the type plates b 2 and b the friction under the plate is important especially when the hybrid piles are unloaded however the limited number of tests performed in real scale does not allow this issue to be discussed the use of skirted footing plates with grouting may be an interesting solution to reduce the permanent displacement of hybrid piles stone et al 2007 haiderali and madabhushi 2015 cheng et al 2019 2 3 numerical model validation numerical modelling was carried out using the finite element method and the plaxis 3d foundation software the analysis was conducted for a monopile of 1 2 m in diameter in homogenous sand the mohr coulomb nonlinear elastic plastic model of soil was used kim jeong 2011 the following sand parameters were used for mes calculations internal friction angle φ 35o young s modulus variants e 20 mpa 80 mpa increased 1 5z with depth z cohesion c 0 001 mpa poisson s ratio ʋ 0 30 and dilatation angle 5o while calculating the displacements and strains in the soil in the 3d setup consecutive stages of applying load to piles were simulated the assumed 3d numerical model of the hybrid monopile consists of over 33 000 elements and more than 89 000 nodes it was built of 15 node solid elements each containing 6 gauss points the dimensions of the model of the hybrid monopile were the same as of the piles in field investigation trojnar 2008b the numerical model of monopile was subjected to validation in view of adapting it to the field investigation conditions and the computation results were referred to the approximation of displacements of the standard pile on fig 14 achmus et al 2009 lesny et al 2007 pedram 2015a trojnar 2008b the application of the 3d fe analysis for the hybrid monopile allowed obtaining a great deal of information about the processes occurring in the subsoil around the pile the numerical analysis was used to qualitatively identify the behavior of the ground around the hybrid monopile and to develop a practical method for its calculation in the future fan long 2005 byrne et al 2017 3 hybrid monopile stiffness evaluation 3 1 small scale test results fig 15 shows the characteristic layout of the soil in front of the hybrid foundation due to the horizontal displacement and the rotation of the foundation model a passive zone a wedge shaped and tapering downward was formed underneath the plate three dimensional stress occurred in this zone caused by simultaneous action of the pile and the plate zone a caused stiffening of the hybrid foundation in the soil an increase of three dimensional interaction and a reduced bending of the pile zone b lies to the right with the peak pointing upwards this is where occurrence of momentary rotation points was observed directly in front of the plate is the displacement zone c also visible on the soil surface the extent and shapes of all zones changed alongside with increasing the horizontal load in the finite limit state of the subsoil shearing of the ground occurred between zones between a and b the shearing plane slanted from the perpendicular at angle β corresponding to the value of the angle of internal friction of sand used in model tests φ 30 based on model tests at small scale it was shown that hybrid foundations interact with the soil differently from standard piles loaded horizontally the horizontal plate fixed to the pile decreases the displacement of the foundation and enhances its three dimensional interaction with the soil results of model tests 1 g confirmed that the effectiveness of limiting the horizontal displacement of the hybrid pile depends on the pile length conclusions from the qualitative examination of the soil behavior around a hybrid foundation were used in the further part of the paper preparing a numeric model of the hybrid foundation 3 2 full scale test results fig 16 presents the plots of the dependence of the ep coefficient on the lateral load on a monopile of 1 2 m in diameter in sand the value of the ep is described as a ratio of the standard pile displacement to the hybrid pile displacement under the same lateral load which was assumed as a measure of the plate effect the ep parameter defined in this way characterizes the plate s influence on the lateral stiffness of a hybrid monopile based on the field investigation results a comparative analysis of the deflections of hybrid and standard monopiles was conducted within the range of load values applied during particular investigation stages the analysis ignored the responses of the monopiles at the initial load stage 0 60 kn because the scatter of the results resulted from initially different density of the soil under the plates of the two tested piles during the two stages of loading the effectiveness of the plate was 1 7 and is consistent with the results of centrifuge model tests conducted by other authors el marassi et al 2008 stone et al 2018 the values above 1 0 mean that the deflection of the hybrid monopile was smaller than that of a standard one the increase in lateral load was accompanied by a gradual increase in the effectiveness of the plates the activity differences between the plate effect ep at the first and the second loading stage 1 2 follow first of all from the different modulus of deformation of the sand control compacted layer surface under the plate it can be seen that at the reloading of the two piles stage 2 within the load range of the previous test stage 1 a change in the monotonic of the effectiveness curve of the plates occurred in this case the values of the ep parameter were greater than in the previous investigation despite lower lateral load values at the same time it is clear that at a pile reloading stage 2 the ep curve decreases monotonically and asymptotically approaches the values obtained in the previous test stage 1 at a pile load above 300 kn the plate effect remained at the same level fig 17 shows the approximate values of the ep coefficient for a hybrid monopile with a plate resting on compacted sand with different values of the young s modulus e 80 mpa and 20 mpa 3 3 results of 3d fe analysis the lateral load on the numerical model monopile was 500 kn it was applied to the pile at 4 m over the ground surface as in the field investigation fig 18 shows comparison of shapes of soil strain fields in the area around two numerical models of 5 m long piles a hybrid one and a standard one the results presented are for successive stages causing the following pile head displacements 10 mm 20 mm and 40 mm respectively the 3d fe analysis allowed a better understanding of the soil and hybrid monopile interactions the lateral load of the monopile assumed for the calculations allowed precise analysis of its behavior in the displacement range of up to 60 mm fig 19 shows shapes of strain fields and zones on the surface of the ground around two monopiles a standard one and a hybrid one at their lateral displacement 10 20 and 40 mm the results of numerical fe calculations are qualitatively similar to those obtained in small scale model tests 1 g as regards the range of compared load values applied in the field investigation and the 3d fe analysis the computed lateral displacements were basically consistent with those measured figs 20 and 21 show calculated values of stresses and displacements of hybrid monopiles below ground level and differences in stress distribution in front of standard and hybrid monopiles with the same lateral load the displacement of the hybrid monopile head is four times smaller than in the case of the standard monopile within the range of loads corresponding to field examinations the maximum strain on the ground of a 5 m hybrid monopile is 25 smaller compared to that of a standard monopile the difference of horizontal stress in the ground indicates that the range of beneficial effect of a foundation plate in field examination conditions was 1 5 m beneath the plate which corresponds to 40 of the monopile length by the use of a coupled plate rigidly connected with the pile the ground in front of a hybrid monopile has higher bearing capacity than in the case of a standard monopile 4 conclusions the effect of the work presented is an explanation of the phenomena occurring in cohesionless soil around hybrid monopiles the behavior of such new foundations in the 3d soil foundation interaction system is described the small scale tests full scale field investigations and numerical 3d analysis of hybrid monopiles show greater lateral stiffness in the ground due to the effective interaction between the monopile the footing plate and the soil within the examined range of displacement caused by test load lateral load on the hybrid monopile activates an additional reaction of the substrate which has a positive effect on limiting the bending of the pile in the soil based on the results of tests and analyses carried out in various scales and based on computational analyses for full size piles with a diameter of 1 2 m the following conclusions can be drawn 1 hybrid piles show greater lateral stiffness in the ground due to the effectiveness of the vertical shaft the horizontal plate and soil within a definite range of displacement of up to 40 mm caused by lateral load 2 when the hybrid piles embedded in cohesionless soil were subjected to horizontal force and bending moment their deflections were smaller than those of the standard piles depending on the plate subsoil deformability and the length of the pile in the case of investigated hybrid monopiles with a diameter of 1 2 m the plate effect rose gradually at a displacement range of 2 10 mm to stabilize under a load greater than 300 kn at 1 7 for 5 m long monopiles 3 field tests show that the impact of friction under the plate is important when hybrid monopiles are unloaded for the lateral load by horizontal force near the ground surface with low bending moment the value of permanent displacement of the pile head after unloading is two times higher than in the case of a standard pile 4 the reduction of hybrid monopile deflection observed during field tests shows an increase in monopile and soil stiffness in the upper segment of a 5 m hybrid monopile to a depth of 1 5 m below the footing plate 
22373,this paper proposes a comprehensive method for reliability analysis of a deep water mooring system the novelty of the newly developed method is that it considers the failure modes of floater offset excess the function of the intact mooring system mooring line breakage safety and fatigue persistence as part of the mooring system s reliability assessment in addition the quantitative relation between mooring line breaking strength and cumulative fatigue damage is considered in this research the annual maximum floater offset and mooring line tension are calculated based on the wave condition with a 1 year return period long term mooring line tension ranges are obtained from coupled analysis in the time domain for all the sea states in the wave scatter diagram and the fatigue damage is assessed using the palmgren miner rule and t n curve then the mooring system s reliability is investigated by running monte carlo simulations the results demonstrate that the failure probability considering the three failure modes is much greater than that of any single mode and neglecting the correlation between different failure modes leads to significant underestimation of the mooring system failure probability moreover the sensitivity analysis indicates that the underestimation proportion is obviously affected by the fatigue exponent m keywords multi mode reliability analysis mooring system floating structure probability distribution function 1 introduction the mooring system is a critical component of offshore floating structures that are widely used in various industrial fields from oil and gas to renewable energy floating structures and their mooring systems are exposed to the ocean environment during their whole service life an intact mooring system will fail in terms of function when the horizontal displacement of the connected floating structure exceeds the limited value in addition breaking damage begg et al 2018 and fatigue damage jameel and ahmad 2011 of mooring lines also leads to mooring system failure mooring system failure leads to great costs in terms of lives the economy and the marine ecological environment therefore mooring system safety during a state of continuous operation particularly under severe environmental conditions is a major research concern in the industry especially given the increasingly recognized importance and development of deeper water exploration grime and langley 2008 uncertainties in mooring system design arise from several sources including the assumptions contained in the selections of the environmental load or response models limitations on available physical data and potential human error during the design process melchers and beck 2018 a deterministic analysis is too difficult to use to present the safe and efficient characteristics of a floater mooring system as a result a probabilistic reliability assessment is essential for a complex mooring system under varying and complex marine environmental conditions goyet et al 2013 reliability is the likelihood of healthy and flawless functionality for a specific time according to existing and predetermined conditions eghbali et al 2018 for the reliability design of a mooring system the system responses including floater excursion and mooring line tension are the main inputs the responses of the offshore system are always characterized by the statistical parameters from a short period of 3 6 h because the statistical properties of the environmental parameters can be considered as approximately stationary at this time scale madsen et al 1986 accordingly the characterization of a long term response can be obtained based on short term response and long term environmental parameter statistics farnes and moan 1994 videiro et al 2002 typically the system response in short term waves can be assumed to be gaussian and narrow banded for linear structures gao and moan 2008 and the long term response can be derived however for a floater mooring system the floater offset and mooring line tension is non gaussian and its spectrum is typically wide banded because of the nonlinearity of the system and sea loads gao and moan 2007 during normal operation the floater s displacement typically comprises a mean offset gaussian wave frequency wf motions with small amplitude and non gaussian low frequency lf motions with large amplitude barltrop 1998 the last response from the resonant excitation of the mooring system are caused by the second order hydrodynamic force all these aspects introduce numerous difficulties in the characterization of the short and long term system responses which are very important in the reliability analysis vazquez hernandez et al 2006 to date unified distribution functions for wide banded and non gaussian responses of a nonlinear system remain unavailable to the authors best knowledge there are only a few studies regarding the long term distribution of the non gaussian process of offshore structural dynamic responses an example is the research completed by dong et al 2011 who presented the long term statistical distribution of a fixed wind turbine s hot spot stress amplitudes under wave and wind loads the hot spot stress amplitudes were numerically simulated and the results indicated that the weibull function can fit the long term statistical distribution of the turbine stress amplitudes only for the case of wave loads however for the cases of wind loads only and a combination of wave and wind loads the generalized gamma distribution is better than the weibull distribution floating system resistances including offset limit breaking strength and fatigue strength are also important inputs for a mooring system reliability assessment constraining the horizontal offset of the moored floater can ensure offshore production or drilling operations under sea loads normally the offset limit of the intact mooring system is determined by the riser performance and the surrounding facilities it is different for systems with different riser configurations api 1993 dnv 2015 the breaking and fatigue strength of the mooring chain are stochastic because of the uncertainty in the material manufacturing and welding two distribution functions normal and lognormal distribution have been accepted to accurately determine the characteristics of the mooring chain breaking strength vazquez hernandez et al 2006 between the two distributions the more popular choice is the lognormal model in which the distribution parameters are the average value and variable coefficient of the mooring line breaking tension montes iturrizaga et al 2007 similar to the breaking strength the fatigue strength of the mooring line is always assumed to obey the lognormal distribution with a mean value of 1 and a variable coefficient of from 0 2 to 0 8 hu et al 2010 notably the mooring line breaking strength and the fatigue strength are not independent of each other although general reliability analyses do not consider their relation the breaking strength decreases with the accumulation of fatigue damage which will in turn accelerate fatigue damage accumulation to date considerable attention has been paid to mooring line reliability analysis vazquez hernandez et al 2006 some of these studies have focused on the application of reliability technologies to offshore engineering to improve prediction accuracy larsen and mathisen 1996 luo and ahilan 1991 or design criteria through a reliability based comparative study of mooring lines vazquez hernandez et al 2006 others have utilized reliability techniques to assess mooring system reliability based on the criteria of the floater offset limit fang et al 2013 analyze the risk probability of mooring lines against their breakage montes iturrizaga et al 2007 or estimate mooring line fatigue damage probability jameel and ahmad 2011 following the mooring system design standards of api api 2005 and abs abs 2003 more specifically the calibration considering the mooring system in an intact condition is addressed in goodwin et al 2000 and horte et al 1998 and the broken line case is presented by goodwin et al 2000 and mathisen et al 1998 recently close attention has been paid to mooring system reliability for initiating a study on mooring line reliability started with questions raised regarding the applicability of mooring standards hørte et al 2017 from the detailed review it has been observed that considerable work has been completed on reliability assessment of mooring systems however most studies only focused on the maximum tension or fatigue damage there are few studies related to reliability assessments of mooring systems simultaneously considering the floater offset limit mooring line breakage and fatigue damage studies considering the quantitative relation between mooring line breaking strength and cumulative fatigue damage are even more scarce in reality three failure modes are coexistent for a mooring system and in principle they are all important in practice from this perspective this study developed a multi mode reliability analysis of a mooring system combining the floater offset limit mooring line tension strength and fatigue strength to improve the reliability analysis rationality the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the time domain coupled dynamic theory for a floater mooring system from which responses were obtained for reliability analysis the preliminary about reliability analysis is presented in section 3 section 4 shows the multi mode reliability analysis method considering the correlation between the breaking strength and fatigue strength in section 5 numerical studies of a generally used reliability analysis method and the new monte carlo theory based method proposed in this paper are presented and compared with each other finally the main conclusions drawn from this study are presented in section 6 2 floater mooring system coupled dynamics a floater and its mooring lines are connected to each other and the system is strongly nonlinear such that the coupled analysis method in the time domain is employed the motion equation for a floating platform with a mooring system in the time domain is as follows reinholdtsen and falkenberg 2001 1 m a x t t κ t τ x τ d τ k s x t f m x t f where m is the floater mass matrix a is the added mass matrix x t is the system displacement x t and x t are the first and second derivative respectively of x t to time t κ t τ is the retardation function accounting for frequency dependent damping k s is the hydrostatic restoring stiffness f m x t is the nonlinear restoring force from the mooring riser system and f is the environmental force including both the wf and lf components potential flow theory is adopted to calculate the wave hydrodynamics for the large floater the first order hydrodynamic problem of a floating body can be divided into three components i e the forces and moments on the body resulting from incident waves diffraction waves and radiation waves the first order wave exciting forces and moments are acquired by integrating the pressure over the wetted surface of the body as follows 2 f j 1 re i s b ρ ω e i ω t φ i φ d φ r n j d s j 1 2 6 where ρ ω φ i φ d φ r n j and s b are the water density wave frequency incident wave potential diffraction wave potential radiation wave potential generalized surface normal in the jth direction and wetted body of the structure in calm water respectively the floater s second order sum frequency forces can be ignored because of the large natural period of each motion degree of freedom the lf wave force f 2 oscillating in difference frequencies ω r ω s can be calculated by means of the so called quadratic transfer function qtf matrix pinkster 1975 matos et al 2011 and the diagonal of the qtf matrix ω r ω s corresponds to the mean wave drift forces in wadam dnv 1994 it is generally given by the following expression dnv 2007 3 f j 2 re r s n a r a s h 2 ω r ω s e i ω r ω s t where a r and a s are the individual wave amplitudes ω r and ω s are the individual wave frequencies r and s are the wave component numbers h 2 is the qtfs for the difference frequency load and t is the time the qtf can be calculated by the direct method lee et al 1991 and the indirect method faltinsen and loken 1978 lighthill 1979 molin 1979 and the later one is adopted in this study the mooring lines are simulated using the finite element method fem and its geometry deformation is calculated in the coupled analysis with a large floater in the time domain the drag inertial and added mass forces are calculated according to the morison equation because of the small diameter of the section compared with the wave length the morison force for unit length element is expressed as follows 4 f m o r c i ρ π d 2 4 u c a ρ π d 2 4 x 1 2 c d ρ u x u x d where d c a and c d are the diameter added mass coefficient and drag coefficients of the morison element respectively and c i c a 1 u u x and x denote the flow velocity flow acceleration element velocity and element acceleration respectively the force at the up end of the mooring lines is applied to the floater in time as the restoring force the restoring force of the mooring system is nonlinear due to the nonlinear wave forces on the mooring lines and large geometry deformation of the mooring lines themselves 3 mooring system limit states the concept of a limit state is used to define the failure in the context of structural reliability analysis failure of a structure or system is always defined through the limit state function g x which is negative or equal to zero at failure x x 1 x 2 x n is the vector of the basic variables describing loads material properties geometry variables statistical estimates and model uncertainties where is the vector transpose the limit state function is defined as z g x s a where s is the system resistance and a is the load effect from the environment based on the limit state function the probability of failure is as follows 5 p p z 0 z 0 f x x d x where f x x is the joint probability density function of vector x uncertainties of resistance and load effect are commonly represented by a joint distribution of key parameters where the mean vector represents the design values and the covariance matrix defines the relative parametric uncertainty grime and langley 2008 the coefficient of variation cov of individual parameters may be measured or reasoned from experience the shape of the joint distribution is typically assumed schall et al 1991 or reasoned as gaussian from a central limit theorem argument lin 1967 for a mooring system it is considered in failure when the offset of the floater constrained by the intact mooring system exceeds the offset limit or one mooring line breaks in the case of undergoing extreme mooring line tension or a mooring line is damaged because of cumulative fatigue thus it is essential to consider all the main failure modes in mooring system reliability analysis in this research all three types of limit states are considered as follows the offset ultimate strength and fatigue limit states 3 1 excess offset limit state function a mooring system is designed to control the offset of the floater connected to it and the platform system installed risers could be out of work when the excess offset occurs if the offset of the floater is described as y and the limit of the offset is determined as y o the state function z o is 6 z o g o y o y y o y here the probability density of the extreme offsets during 1 year is set as f o y the offset limit is always defined as a certain percentage of water depth in addition the two variables y o and y are independent of each other based on eq 5 the failure probability of the mooring system during 1 year caused by excess offset is as follows 7 p o p z o 0 z o 0 f o y d y thus the excess offset failure probability of the system over q years p o l can be calculated as follows 8 p o l q p z o 1 0 z o 2 0 z o q 0 where z o i is the offset failure state during the ith year because the resistance is a constant and the floater offset response in every year is independent of that during other years the failure state during 1 year is independent of that during other years as a result p o l can be calculated as follows 9 p o l q 1 1 p o q 3 2 ultimate limit state here the ultimate limit state for a mooring system is specifically related to the mooring line breaking the mooring line breaking strength for each mooring chain link t b is always obtained from the breaking tensile test and obeys the lognormal distribution f to t b as follows 10 f t o t b 1 2 π σ t t b e ln t b μ t 2 2 σ t 2 where the coefficients μ t and σ t are determined by the expectation value e t and variance d t of the chain link breaking strength as shown in eq 11 11 σ t ln d t e t 2 1 μ t ln e t 2 d t e t 2 the expected breaking tension is always assumed as 1 2 times the minimum breaking tension mbt and the standard deviation is 0 1 times the mean breaking tension bruen et al 1991 bush et al 1992 montes iturrizaga et al 2007 based on eq 7 the cumulative probability function of the breaking strength can be written as follows 12 f t o t b 0 t b f t o t d t the aforementioned description is suitable for a single mooring chain link meanwhile a mooring line or mooring system comprises many links and it can be treated as a series system the resistances of individual components are statistically independent and identically distributed thus the breaking strength of the mooring line should meet the minimum strength principle montes iturrizaga et al 2007 vazquez hernandez et al 2006 the cumulative strength probability of the mooring line f tl can be written as follows 13 f t l t b 1 1 f t o t b h where h is the number of the mooring chain links when h is sufficiently large f tl can be rewritten as follows 14 f t l t b 1 exp h f t 0 t b substituting eqs 10 and 12 into eq 14 the breaking strength of the mooring line is as follows 15 f t l t b 1 exp λ t b k where λ e t 1 δ 2 exp υ ln 1 δ 2 k α ln 1 δ 2 δ is the variable coefficient of the mooring line breaking strength υ 2 ln h ln ln h ln 4 π 2 2 ln h and α 2 ln h making a derivative of f tl to t the probability density function of a whole mooring line breaking strength can be obtained as follows 16 f t l t b k λ k t b k 1 exp λ t b k it is assumed that the extreme mooring line tension during 1 year t can also be described by a probability density function ex f t t the breaking strength limit state function can be written as follows 17 z b g b t b t t b t 3 3 the failure probability during 1 year is as follows 18 p b p z b 0 the failure probability of a mooring system caused by extreme line tension over q years can be computed as follows 19 p b l q p z b 1 0 z b 2 0 z b q 0 where z b i is the breaking failure state function during the ith year 3 4 fatigue limit state mooring line fatigue damage is determined by tension ranges double amplitude and their corresponding circle numbers based on the palmgren miner rule and the number of cycles to failure t n curve for mooring lines t n curves are often obtained from the results of fatigue experiments as follows api 2005 20 n r m k where n is the number of cycles to cause failure for a constant tension range r is the ratio of the tension range to the mooring line breaking tension m and k empirically determined from fatigue experiments are the t n curve negative inverse slope and intercept parameter respectively it is an acceptable practice that the fatigue damage induced by tensions can be obtained as the ratio of the number of cycles n i whose tension range ratio is r i to the number of cycles n i that will cause fatigue failure at that tension range as determined from the t n curve the cumulative fatigue damage is the linear summation of the individual damages from all of the considered tension range intervals which is referred to as the palmgren miner rule miner 1945 as follows 21 d n i n i n i r i m k when the probability density function of the mooring line tension ranges during 1 year f t is known the annual fatigue damage of the mooring line can be written as follows 22 d n t k 0 r m f t r d t n t k t b m 0 t r m f t r d t r where n t is total number of mooring line tension cycles during 1 year and t r is the tension range in general fatigue analysis the structural fatigue strength d f is often taken as 1 however the fatigue strength is actually stochastic and obeys the lognormal distribution f d wirsching 1984 as follows 23 f d d f 1 2 π σ d d f e ln d f μ d 2 2 σ d 2 where the distribution parameters μ d and σ d are determined by the expectation value e d and variance d d of the mooring line fatigue strength as follows 24 σ d ln d d e d 2 1 μ d ln e d 2 d d e d 2 where e d and d d are often determined to be 1 and 0 2 respectively similar to the mooring line ultimate strength the probability density function of the fatigue strength of mooring lines composed of many chain links is easily derived as follows 25 f d l d f k d λ d k d d f k 1 exp λ d d f k d where k d and λ d have a similar meaning to that of k and λ in eq 16 thus the state function for fatigue z f can be written as follows 26 z f d f d d f n t k t b m 0 t r m f t d t r to consider the uncertainties associated with the aforementioned expression the factors involved in the expression are modeled as random variables the fatigue limit state function is as follows 27 z f g f x d f b m k n t t b m 0 t r m f t d t r where x d f b k and d f b and k are random variables independent of each other here b describes the inaccuracies in mooring line tension estimation in offshore engineering random variables required for participating in the fatigue limit state evaluation are tabulated as listed in table 1 dnv 2010 jameel and ahmad 2011 similarly the annual fatigue failure probability can be written as follows 28 p f p z f 0 the fatigue failure probability of the mooring system over q years is as follows 29 p f l q p z f l q d f i 1 q d i 0 where d i is the fatigue damage during the ith year and z f l q is the fatigue limit state function during the qth year 4 multi mode reliability analysis method in section 3 the three common mooring system failure modes including offset ultimate strength and fatigue failure were introduced the three failure modes coexist for a mooring system and it is unreasonable to consider only a single failure mode in the reliability analysis which would however overestimate the safety reliability of the mooring system to overcome this issue a multi mode reliability analysis method is proposed here the three failure modes are in series because the mooring system will be in a state of failure when any failure mode occurs assuming that the aforementioned failure modes are independent of each other the failure probability of the mooring system over q years p sys l is as follows 30 p s y s l q 1 1 p o l q 1 p b l q 1 p f l q however the variables of the responses and the resistances in different failure modes are not independent of each other for the responses as shown in section 2 the floater and mooring lines are considered as a whole coupled system with strong nonlinearity when dynamic analysis is conducted the correlation among floater offset mooring line tension and line tension range is complex and difficult to analytically express it will be investigated using numerical method in section 5 in addition the responses and resistances are dependent in each other in which the relationship between the breaking strength and cumulative fatigue damage is most significant and should be specially considered 4 1 relationship between breaking strength and cumulative fatigue damage as described in section 2 3 mooring line breakage reliability is assessed based on a certain tension strength distribution function and parameters are generally considered as constants for the entire design life however in fact the structural tensile strength decreases with fatigue damage accumulation hanswille et al 2007 oehlers 1990 as a result the breaking strength should be updated with the fatigue damage accumulation during the reliability analysis of a mooring system in the simulation the breaking strength is annually updated but not in real time to simplify the numerical computation the residual breaking strength during the qth year is calculated as follows 31 t b q t b 0 q 1 t b 0 1 i 1 q 1 d i q 2 where t b0 is the initial breaking strength of the mooring line d q is the fatigue damage of the mooring line during the ith year and t b q is the residual breaking strength of the mooring line during the qth year in return the decrease in breaking tension will accelerate the mooring line fatigue damage accumulation eq 22 can be rewritten as follows 32 d q n t k t b m q 0 t r m f t r d t r 4 2 reliability analysis method based on multi failure modes the resistance and load effect of a mooring system are correlated with each other as shown in fig 1 a mooring system s failure limit state function considering the floater offset excess mooring line breakage and fatigue damage can be written as follows 33 z s y s g s y s x min g o g b g f in which x y y 0 t t l d f b k thus the failure probability of the mooring system is as follows 34 p s y s p z s y s 0 p z o 0 z b 0 z f 0 failure probability of the mooring system until it has worked q years is as follows 35 p s y s l q p z o 1 0 z o 2 0 z o q 0 z b 1 0 z b 2 0 z b q 0 z f l q 0 the derivate of the joint distribution of the variables is difficult to analytically derive because the correlations between the responses and load responses is complex the exact calculation of the failure probability of the system is typically quite difficult if at all possible nowak and collins 2012 thus in this research the monte carlo method is adopted and the flowchart is shown in fig 2 5 numerical study in this section the reliability analysis is described for the mooring system of a deep water semi submersible platform failure probabilities of different single modes and a combined case are assessed and the results from the proposed method are compared with those of conventional methods 5 1 numerical model of a semi submersible platform and mooring system the numerical model of the coupled platform mooring system established in this research is shown in fig 3 the platform is double symmetrical about the x and y axis and its particular dimensions are as follows the total length is 114 07 m the width is 79 m and the draft is 18 m with a displacement of 52 275 t the catenary mooring system consists of 12 lines divided into 4 groups each group of mooring lines is 90 apart with 3 lines 5 apart in each corner four groups of the mooring line are centered at 45 135 225 and 315 respectively each mooring line is composed of three components in a chain wire chain configuration the components of each mooring line at the fairlead and anchor adopted a stud link chain and the spiral strand wire is between the two segments of chain links the physical properties of the mooring lines are tabulated in table 2 and table 3 lists the mooring system configuration 5 2 environmental condition in the simulation the short term sea state is modeled using the jonswap spectrum and the long term sea state is described by the north atlantic ocean scatter diagram as listed in table 4 the short term responses of the semi submersible platform motion and mooring line tension are calculated in the time domain for every sea state the long term statistical characteristics during 1 year can be studied by superimposing the short term results of all the sea states in the wave scatter diagram for an extreme response of the mooring line tension and floater offset an extreme sea state with a 1 year return period is needed and it can be predicted by the joint distribution function of the significant wave height and spectral peak period f h s t p there are several long term statistical models described in the literature such as those of haver and nyhus 1986 and mathisen and bitner gregersen 1990 in this work the haver nyhus formulation is adopted as follows 36 f h s t p f h s f t p h s where the marginal probability density function of h s is given as follows 37 f h s 1 2 π ξ h s exp ln h s μ h 2 2 ξ 2 if h s η ˆ β ρ h s ρ β 1 exp h s ρ β if h s η ˆ the conditional probability density function of t p is 38 f t p h s 1 2 π σ t p exp i n t p μ t 2 2 σ 2 39 μ t h s a 1 a 2 h s a 3 σ 2 h s b 1 b 2 exp b 3 h s b 4 in these functions ξ μ h η p β a 1 a 2 a 3 b 1 b 2 b 3 and b 4 are the experienced parameters and vary within different sea areas for the present research these parameters are estimated using the least square method according to the data in the wave scatter diagram as shown in table 4 ξ μ h η ˆ β and ρ are estimated as 0 751 1 03 2 35 1 67 and 3 45 respectively based on the data in the rightmost column of table 4 the fitting result is shown in fig 4 similarly a 1 a 2 a 3 b 1 b 2 b 3 and b 4 are estimated as 1 21 0 974 0 140 0 159 0 130 0 0119 and 2 32 respectively based on the data in each row of table 4 fig 5 shows the fitting results of the conditional probability density function of t p for different significant wave heights it seems that the fitted curve underestimates the probability near the peak particularly for the large significant wave height however it is gratifying that the position of the peaks of the sample and the fitted curve are nearly the same every short term state is considered as a 3 h process such that the exceedance probability of the wave condition with a return period of 1 year is 3 365 24 3 42 10 4 according to eq 37 the annual extreme significant wave height is 11 98 m then the most likely spectral peak period can be obtained as 11 4 s using through eq 38 and it is the position of the peak of the conditional probability density curve as shown in fig 6 5 3 floater mooring dynamic responses and distribution characteristics the semi submersible platform model is built using the sesam genie software published by the dnv gl the wetted surface of the platform hull is described with panel elements while the bracing and mooring lines as small dimensional structures are modeled with the morrison elements then the first and second order hydrodynamic coefficients of the floater are calculated using the sesam wadam software and exported to the sesam deepc software for coupled dynamic analysis after that the floater response and mooring line tension time histories under the 73 sea states of the wave scatter diagram and under the annual extreme wave condition are treated as the database for fatigue damage assessment and multi mode reliability analysis 5 3 1 probability distribution of the annual extreme horizontal offset and mooring line tension the annual extreme platform offset and mooring line tension are obtained from the analysis under the annual extreme wave condition as described in subsection 5 2 coupled simulations of the floater and mooring system with a typical 3 h duration are conducted 30 times for the annual extreme wave condition from each simulation the maximum value is detected as one extreme sample and finally the distributions of the annual extreme floater offset and mooring line tension are both determined as a weibull distribution as shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively through distribution fitting and comparing 5 3 2 probability distribution of the mooring line tension ranges generally the weibull distribution is the most commonly used approach for long term distribution of offshore structural response ranges however because of the strong nonlinearity of the coupled system and the environmental loads the weibull distribution does not agree well with the actual statistical result of the mooring line tension ranges li et al 2016 to conduct a realistic long term mooring line tension amplitude simulation gamma distribution is introduced here fig 9 shows that the gamma distribution seems to reasonably agree with the long term statistical distribution of the mooring line tension amplitudes 5 4 reliability analysis of the mooring system the failure probability of the mooring system is evaluated by means of monte carlo simulation considering the probabilistic description of the random variables in the input and output in which 107 simulations of the mooring system service life are conducted these simulations take approximately 15 min using a 32 core computer with an e 5 central processing unit at a main frequency of 3 20 ghz 5 4 1 failure probability of the mooring system based on an independent assumption in this subsection the three failure modes of the mooring system are assumed to be independent from each other as shown in fig 10 and they are compared with the proposed method in section 5 4 2 fig 11 shows the failure probability of the mooring system for the independent failure modes for the offset failure mode the resistance is a constant which is often provided by the owner and designer of the platform mooring system and the responses during different years are independent from each other as a consequence the annual offset failure probability in each year is same theoretically and the cumulative offset failure probability nearly linearly increases as shown in fig 11 the probability of breaking is slightly greater than the offset during the first few years but it is gradually outpaced the slow increasing rate of the breaking failure probability in the late years can be explained as follows the breaking strength of the 107 mooring systems obeys log normal distribution and once a mooring system is chosen its resistance for every failure mode is deterministic the extreme tensions for these mooring systems are independent with their breaking strength the mooring system with a weaker breaking strength fails at a higher probability during the first few years whereas for the rest intact mooring systems normally have greater breaking strength however the extreme tension doesn t increase thus the number of newly failed mooring systems during the last years is much lower than that during the first few years from the perspective of the entire service life fatigue failure is the most severe of the three failure modes during the first few years the fatigue failure probability is nearly same with that of the other two failure modes however the fatigue damage of the mooring system cumulates annually and the failure probability rapidly increases in addition the increasing rate of failure probability is increasingly greater with years based on the assumption that the three failure modes are independent from each other the combined failure probability can be calculated using eq 30 and it is higher than every single failure mode because of the serial relation of the failure modes the failure probability of the mooring system is 4 7 10 3 when the operation time is 25 years while the failure probability of the mooring system for fatigue breaking and offset is only 2 4 10 3 8 6 10 4 and 1 4 10 3 respectively it can be concluded that the failure probability of the mooring system is significantly underestimated if only one failure mode is considered in the reliability design 5 4 2 failure probability of the mooring system based on the proposed model in this section the failure probability of the mooring system is described using the proposed model as shown in figs 1 and 2 the average fatigue damage during different operation years is shown in fig 12 which indicates that the annual fatigue damage significantly increases with operation year this result can be explained by the accumulation of fatigue damage reducing the breaking strength as shown in eq 31 and the reduction of the breaking strength can increase the annual fatigue damage in return as described in eq 22 for a certain failure mode the difference between the calculated failure probability and the independent case is mainly caused by considering the relation of the breaking strength and cumulative fatigue damage in the proposed method as a result it can be concluded that the offset failure probability is the same as the independent case while the failure probabilities of fatigue damage and breakage determined using the proposed model significantly increased as shown in fig 13 comparing figs 11 13 the breaking and fatigue failure probability in the independent case is underestimated by 53 1 and 26 8 respectively for the combined failure probability to intensively observe the effect of the dependence between the different failure modes the underestimation proportion for failure probability of the mooring system in the independent state is listed in table 5 table 5 shows that the failure probability of the mooring system is obviously underestimated when the correlation is neglected and the underestimation proportion increases annually with the accumulation of fatigue damage and decrease in the breaking strength for the entire design life the failure probability is underestimated by greater than 27 which may lead to considerable safety risk that cannot be ignored 5 4 3 parametric sensitivity analysis as described in section 5 4 2 fatigue damage is the most important aspect of the three failure modes thus in this subsection the contribution of the fatigue damage to the mooring system is described and sensitivity analysis of the system failure probability for the related parameter fatigue exponent m is conducted because the ratio of the mooring line tension range to the breaking tension is less than 1 the smaller the parameter m the larger the increase in fatigue damage as shown in fig 14 at the same time because of the mutually reinforcing effect of the fatigue damage and the breaking strength the growth rate of the increasing proportion of the annual fatigue damage is higher when the value of m is smaller the failure probability of the mooring system is significantly affected by the value of m as shown in fig 15 the failure probability in the independent case is more seriously underestimated when m is smaller the underestimation percentage is greater than 60 when the value of m is 2 8 but is only approximately 10 when m is 3 2 the smaller the m the more attention should be paid to the correlation between the different failure modes this can be explained by the effect of m on the mooring line breaking strength and fatigue damage a smaller m leads to greater fatigue damage which decreases the breaking strength which leads to greater fatigue damage in return 6 conclusions the reliability of a mooring system used for a deep water semi submersible platform was investigated during the reliability analysis three failure modes including floater offset mooring line breakage and fatigue damage were considered as well as the quantitative relation between the mooring line breaking strength and cumulative fatigue damage the failure probability of the mooring system assessed using the proposed method was presented and compared with the results of the conventional independent method the following conclusions can be drawn from the present study 1 through statistical analysis of the response time trace obtained from the coupled dynamic analysis in the time domain the probability density of the annual maximum floater offset and mooring line tension are both well described by the weibull distribution and the mooring line tension range obeys a gamma distribution 2 fatigue failure is the most important mode among the three common failure modes assessed in this study and the failure probability considering the three failure modes as independent and serial is much greater than that of any single mode 3 consideration of the relation of the breaking strength and the cumulative fatigue damage accelerates the increase in fatigue damage and decrease in the mooring line breaking strength the failure probabilities of fatigue damage and breakage are significantly greater than in the case neglecting the relation of the breaking strength and cumulative fatigue damage 4 ignoring the correlation between the three failure modes and the quantitative relation between the mooring line breaking strength and cumulative fatigue damage leads to significant underestimation of the failure probability of the mooring system the underestimated proportion is greater than 27 for the operation lifecycle in this numerical example and should be paid attention during system design 5 the effect of consideration of multiple failure modes on the reliability analysis of the mooring system is affected by the fatigue exponent m a decrease in m leads to a greater underestimation acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the support by the national natural science foundation of china 51709247

22373,this paper proposes a comprehensive method for reliability analysis of a deep water mooring system the novelty of the newly developed method is that it considers the failure modes of floater offset excess the function of the intact mooring system mooring line breakage safety and fatigue persistence as part of the mooring system s reliability assessment in addition the quantitative relation between mooring line breaking strength and cumulative fatigue damage is considered in this research the annual maximum floater offset and mooring line tension are calculated based on the wave condition with a 1 year return period long term mooring line tension ranges are obtained from coupled analysis in the time domain for all the sea states in the wave scatter diagram and the fatigue damage is assessed using the palmgren miner rule and t n curve then the mooring system s reliability is investigated by running monte carlo simulations the results demonstrate that the failure probability considering the three failure modes is much greater than that of any single mode and neglecting the correlation between different failure modes leads to significant underestimation of the mooring system failure probability moreover the sensitivity analysis indicates that the underestimation proportion is obviously affected by the fatigue exponent m keywords multi mode reliability analysis mooring system floating structure probability distribution function 1 introduction the mooring system is a critical component of offshore floating structures that are widely used in various industrial fields from oil and gas to renewable energy floating structures and their mooring systems are exposed to the ocean environment during their whole service life an intact mooring system will fail in terms of function when the horizontal displacement of the connected floating structure exceeds the limited value in addition breaking damage begg et al 2018 and fatigue damage jameel and ahmad 2011 of mooring lines also leads to mooring system failure mooring system failure leads to great costs in terms of lives the economy and the marine ecological environment therefore mooring system safety during a state of continuous operation particularly under severe environmental conditions is a major research concern in the industry especially given the increasingly recognized importance and development of deeper water exploration grime and langley 2008 uncertainties in mooring system design arise from several sources including the assumptions contained in the selections of the environmental load or response models limitations on available physical data and potential human error during the design process melchers and beck 2018 a deterministic analysis is too difficult to use to present the safe and efficient characteristics of a floater mooring system as a result a probabilistic reliability assessment is essential for a complex mooring system under varying and complex marine environmental conditions goyet et al 2013 reliability is the likelihood of healthy and flawless functionality for a specific time according to existing and predetermined conditions eghbali et al 2018 for the reliability design of a mooring system the system responses including floater excursion and mooring line tension are the main inputs the responses of the offshore system are always characterized by the statistical parameters from a short period of 3 6 h because the statistical properties of the environmental parameters can be considered as approximately stationary at this time scale madsen et al 1986 accordingly the characterization of a long term response can be obtained based on short term response and long term environmental parameter statistics farnes and moan 1994 videiro et al 2002 typically the system response in short term waves can be assumed to be gaussian and narrow banded for linear structures gao and moan 2008 and the long term response can be derived however for a floater mooring system the floater offset and mooring line tension is non gaussian and its spectrum is typically wide banded because of the nonlinearity of the system and sea loads gao and moan 2007 during normal operation the floater s displacement typically comprises a mean offset gaussian wave frequency wf motions with small amplitude and non gaussian low frequency lf motions with large amplitude barltrop 1998 the last response from the resonant excitation of the mooring system are caused by the second order hydrodynamic force all these aspects introduce numerous difficulties in the characterization of the short and long term system responses which are very important in the reliability analysis vazquez hernandez et al 2006 to date unified distribution functions for wide banded and non gaussian responses of a nonlinear system remain unavailable to the authors best knowledge there are only a few studies regarding the long term distribution of the non gaussian process of offshore structural dynamic responses an example is the research completed by dong et al 2011 who presented the long term statistical distribution of a fixed wind turbine s hot spot stress amplitudes under wave and wind loads the hot spot stress amplitudes were numerically simulated and the results indicated that the weibull function can fit the long term statistical distribution of the turbine stress amplitudes only for the case of wave loads however for the cases of wind loads only and a combination of wave and wind loads the generalized gamma distribution is better than the weibull distribution floating system resistances including offset limit breaking strength and fatigue strength are also important inputs for a mooring system reliability assessment constraining the horizontal offset of the moored floater can ensure offshore production or drilling operations under sea loads normally the offset limit of the intact mooring system is determined by the riser performance and the surrounding facilities it is different for systems with different riser configurations api 1993 dnv 2015 the breaking and fatigue strength of the mooring chain are stochastic because of the uncertainty in the material manufacturing and welding two distribution functions normal and lognormal distribution have been accepted to accurately determine the characteristics of the mooring chain breaking strength vazquez hernandez et al 2006 between the two distributions the more popular choice is the lognormal model in which the distribution parameters are the average value and variable coefficient of the mooring line breaking tension montes iturrizaga et al 2007 similar to the breaking strength the fatigue strength of the mooring line is always assumed to obey the lognormal distribution with a mean value of 1 and a variable coefficient of from 0 2 to 0 8 hu et al 2010 notably the mooring line breaking strength and the fatigue strength are not independent of each other although general reliability analyses do not consider their relation the breaking strength decreases with the accumulation of fatigue damage which will in turn accelerate fatigue damage accumulation to date considerable attention has been paid to mooring line reliability analysis vazquez hernandez et al 2006 some of these studies have focused on the application of reliability technologies to offshore engineering to improve prediction accuracy larsen and mathisen 1996 luo and ahilan 1991 or design criteria through a reliability based comparative study of mooring lines vazquez hernandez et al 2006 others have utilized reliability techniques to assess mooring system reliability based on the criteria of the floater offset limit fang et al 2013 analyze the risk probability of mooring lines against their breakage montes iturrizaga et al 2007 or estimate mooring line fatigue damage probability jameel and ahmad 2011 following the mooring system design standards of api api 2005 and abs abs 2003 more specifically the calibration considering the mooring system in an intact condition is addressed in goodwin et al 2000 and horte et al 1998 and the broken line case is presented by goodwin et al 2000 and mathisen et al 1998 recently close attention has been paid to mooring system reliability for initiating a study on mooring line reliability started with questions raised regarding the applicability of mooring standards hørte et al 2017 from the detailed review it has been observed that considerable work has been completed on reliability assessment of mooring systems however most studies only focused on the maximum tension or fatigue damage there are few studies related to reliability assessments of mooring systems simultaneously considering the floater offset limit mooring line breakage and fatigue damage studies considering the quantitative relation between mooring line breaking strength and cumulative fatigue damage are even more scarce in reality three failure modes are coexistent for a mooring system and in principle they are all important in practice from this perspective this study developed a multi mode reliability analysis of a mooring system combining the floater offset limit mooring line tension strength and fatigue strength to improve the reliability analysis rationality the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the time domain coupled dynamic theory for a floater mooring system from which responses were obtained for reliability analysis the preliminary about reliability analysis is presented in section 3 section 4 shows the multi mode reliability analysis method considering the correlation between the breaking strength and fatigue strength in section 5 numerical studies of a generally used reliability analysis method and the new monte carlo theory based method proposed in this paper are presented and compared with each other finally the main conclusions drawn from this study are presented in section 6 2 floater mooring system coupled dynamics a floater and its mooring lines are connected to each other and the system is strongly nonlinear such that the coupled analysis method in the time domain is employed the motion equation for a floating platform with a mooring system in the time domain is as follows reinholdtsen and falkenberg 2001 1 m a x t t κ t τ x τ d τ k s x t f m x t f where m is the floater mass matrix a is the added mass matrix x t is the system displacement x t and x t are the first and second derivative respectively of x t to time t κ t τ is the retardation function accounting for frequency dependent damping k s is the hydrostatic restoring stiffness f m x t is the nonlinear restoring force from the mooring riser system and f is the environmental force including both the wf and lf components potential flow theory is adopted to calculate the wave hydrodynamics for the large floater the first order hydrodynamic problem of a floating body can be divided into three components i e the forces and moments on the body resulting from incident waves diffraction waves and radiation waves the first order wave exciting forces and moments are acquired by integrating the pressure over the wetted surface of the body as follows 2 f j 1 re i s b ρ ω e i ω t φ i φ d φ r n j d s j 1 2 6 where ρ ω φ i φ d φ r n j and s b are the water

r and ω s are the individual wave frequencies r and s are the wave component numbers h 2 is the qtfs for the difference frequency load and t is the time the qtf can be calculated by the direct method lee et al 1991 and the indirect method faltinsen and loken 1978 lighthill 1979 molin 1979 and the later one is adopted in this study the mooring lines are simulated using the finite element method fem and its geometry deformation is calculated in the coupled analysis with a large floater in the time domain the drag inertial and added mass forces are calculated according to the morison equation because of the small diameter of the section compared with the wave length the morison force for unit length element is expressed as follows 4 f m o r c i ρ π d 2 4 u c a ρ π d 2 4 x 1 2 c d ρ u x u x d where d c a and c d are the diameter added mass coefficient and drag coefficients of the morison element respectively and c i c a 1 u u x and x denote the flow velocity flow acceleration element velocity and element acceleration respectively the force at the up end of the mooring lines is applied to the floater in time as the restoring force the restoring force of the mooring system is nonlinear due to the nonlinear wave forces on the mooring lines and large geometry deformation of the mooring lines themselves 3 mooring system limit states the concept of a limit state is used to define the failure in the context of structural reliability analysis failure of a structure or system is always defined through the limit state function g x which is negative or equal to zero at failure x x 1 x 2 x n is the vector of the basic variables describing loads material properties geometry variables statistical estimates and model uncertainties where is the vector transpose the limit state function is defined as z g x s a where s is the system resistance and a is the load effect from the environment based on the limit state function the probability of failure is as follows 5 p p z 0 z 0 f x x d x where f x x is the joint probability density function of vector x uncertainties of resistance and load effect are commonly represented by a joint distribution of key parameters where the mean vector represents the design values and the covariance matrix defines the relative parametric uncertainty grime and langley 2008 the coefficient of variation cov of individual parameters may be measured or reasoned from experience the shape of the joint distribution is typically assumed schall et al 1991 or reasoned as gaussian from a central limit theorem argument lin 1967 for a mooring system it is considered in failure when the offset of the floater constrained by the intact mooring system exceeds the offset limit or one mooring line breaks in the case of undergoing extreme mooring line tension or a mooring line is damaged because of cumulative fatigue thus it is essential to consider all the main failure modes in mooring system reliability analysis in this research all three types of limit states are considered as follows the offset ultimate strength and fatigue limit states 3 1 excess offset limit state function a mooring system is designed to control the offset of the floater connected to it and the platform system installed risers could be out of work when the excess offset occurs if the offset of the floater is described as y and the limit of the offset is determined as y o the state function z o is 6 z o g o y o y y o y here the probability density of the extreme offsets during 1 year is set as f o y the offset limit is always defined as a certain percentage of water depth in addition the two variables y o and y are independent of each other based on eq 5 the failure probability of the mooring system during 1 year caused by excess offset is as follows 7 p o p z o 0 z o 0 f o y d y thus the excess offset failure probability of the system over q years p o l can be calculated as follows 8 p o l q p z o 1 0 z o 2 0 z o q 0 where z o i is the offset failure state during the ith year because the resistance is a constant and the floater offset response in every year is independent of that during other years the failure state during 1 year is independent of that during other years as a result p o l can be calculated as follows 9 p o l q 1 1 p o q 3 2 ultimate limit state here the ultimate limit state for a mooring system is specifically related to the mooring line breaking the mooring line breaking strength for each mooring chain link t b is always obtained from the breaking tensile test and obeys the lognormal distribution f to t b as follows 10 f t o t b 1 2 π σ t t b e ln t b μ t 2 2 σ t 2 where the coefficients μ t and σ t are determined by the expectation value e t and variance d t of the chain link breaking strength as shown in eq 11 11 σ t ln d t e t 2 1 μ t ln e t 2 d t e t 2 the expected breaking tension is always assumed as 1 2 times the minimum breaking tension mbt and the standard deviation is 0 1 times the mean breaking tension bruen et al 1991 bush et al 1992 montes iturrizaga et al 2007 based on eq 7 the cumulative probability function of the breaking strength can be written as follows 12 f t o t b 0 t b f t o t d t the aforementioned description is suitable for a single mooring chain link meanwhile a mooring line or mooring system comprises many links and it can be treated as a series system the resistances of individual components are statistically independent and identically distributed thus the breaking strength of the mooring line should meet the minimum strength principle montes iturrizaga et al 2007 vazquez hernandez et al 2006 the cumulative strength probability of the mooring line f tl can be written as follows 13 f t l t b 1 1 f t o t b h where h is the number of the mooring chain links when h is sufficiently large f tl can be rewritten as follows 14 f t l t b 1 exp h f t 0 t b substituting eqs 10 and 12 into eq 14 the breaking strength of the mooring line is as follows 15 f t l t b 1 exp λ t b k where λ e t 1 δ 2 exp υ ln 1 δ 2 k α ln 1 δ 2 δ is the variable coefficient of the mooring line breaking strength υ 2 ln h ln ln h ln 4 π 2 2 ln h and α 2 ln h making a derivative of f tl to t the probability density function of a whole mooring line breaking strength can be obtained as follows 16 f t l t b k λ k t b k 1 exp λ t b k it is assumed that the extreme mooring line tension during 1 year t can also be described by a probability density function ex f t t the breaking strength limit state function can be written as follows 17 z b g b t b t t b t 3 3 the failure probability during 1 year is as follows 18 p b p z b 0 the failure probability of a mooring system caused by extreme line tension over q years can be computed as follows 19 p b l q p z b 1 0 z b 2 0 z b q 0 where z b i is the breaking failure state function during the ith year 3 4 fatigue limit state mooring line fatigue damage is determined by tension ranges double amplitude and their corresponding circle numbers based on the palmgren miner rule and the number of cycles to failure t n curve for mooring lines t n curves are often obtained from the results of fatigue experiments as follows api 2005 20 n r m k where n is the number of cycles to cause failure for a constant tension range r is the ratio of the tension range to the mooring line breaking tension m and k empirically determined from fatigue experiments are the t n curve negative inverse slope and intercept parameter respectively it is an acceptable practice that the fatigue damage induced by tensions can be obtained as the ratio of the number of cycles n i whose tension range ratio is r i to the number of cycles n i that will cause fatigue failure at that tension range as determined from the t n curve the cumulative fatigue damage is the linear summation of the individual damages from all of the considered tension range intervals which is referred to as the palmgren miner rule miner 1945 as follows 21 d n i n i n i r i m k when the probability density function of the mooring line tension ranges during 1 year f t is known the annual fatigue damage of the mooring line can be written as follows 22 d n t k 0 r m f t r d t n t k t b m 0 t r m f t r d t r where n t is total number of mooring line tension cycles during 1 year and t r is the tension range in general fatigue analysis the structural fatigue strength d f is often taken as 1 however the fatigue strength is actually stochastic and obeys the lognormal distribution f d wirsching 1984 as follows 23 f d d f 1 2 π σ d d f e ln d f μ d 2 2 σ d 2 where the distribution parameters μ d and σ d are determined by the expectation value e d and variance d d of the mooring line fatigue strength as follows 24 σ d ln d d e d 2 1 μ d ln e d 2 d d e d 2 where e d and d d are often determined to be 1 and 0 2 respectively similar to the mooring line ultimate strength the probability density function of the fatigue strength of mooring lines composed of many chain links is easily derived as follows 25 f d l d f k d λ d k d d f k 1 exp λ d d f k d where k d and λ d have a similar meaning to that of k and λ in eq 16 thus the state function for fatigue z f can be written as follows 26 z f d f d d f n t k t b m 0 t r m f t d t r to consider the uncertainties associated with the aforementioned expression the factors involved in the expression are modeled as random variables the fatigue limit state function is as follows 27 z f g f x d f b m k n t t b m 0 t r m f t d t r where x d f b k and d f b and k are random variables independent of each other here b describes the inaccuracies in mooring line tension estimation in offshore engineering random variables required for participating in the fatigue limit state evaluation are tabulated as listed in table 1 dnv 2010 jameel and ahmad 2011 similarly the annual fatigue failure probability can be written as follows 28 p f p z f 0 the fatigue failure probability of the mooring system over q years is as follows 29 p f l q p z f l q d f i 1 q d i 0 where d i is the fatigue damage during the ith year and z f l q is the fatigue limit state function during the qth year 4 multi mode reliability analysis method in section 3 the three common mooring system failure modes including offset ultimate strength and fatigue failure were introduced the three failure modes coexist for a mooring system and it is unreasonable to consider only a single failure mode in the reliability analysis which would however overestimate the safety reliability of the mooring system to overcome this issue a multi mode reliability analysis method is proposed here the three failure modes are in series because the mooring system will be in a state of failure when any failure mode occurs assuming that the aforementioned failure modes are independent of each other the failure probability of the mooring system over q years p sys l is as follows 30 p s y s l q 1 1 p o l q 1 p b l q 1 p f l q however the variables of the responses and the resistances in different failure modes are not independent of each other for the responses as shown in section 2 the floater and mooring lines are considered as a whole coupled system with strong nonlinearity when dynamic analysis is conducted the correlation among floater offset mooring line tension and line tension range is complex and difficult to analytically express it will be investigated using numerical method in section 5 in addition the responses and resistances are dependent in each other in which the relationship between the breaking strength and cumulative fatigue damage is most significant and should be specially considered 4 1 relationship between breaking strength and cumulative fatigue damage as described in section 2 3 mooring line breakage reliability is assessed based on a certain tension strength distribution function and parameters are generally considered as constants for the entire design life however in fact the structural tensile strength decreases with fatigue damage accumulation hanswille et al 2007 oehlers 1990 as a result the breaking strength should be updated with the fatigue damage accumulation during the reliability analysis of a mooring system in the simulation the breaking strength is annually updated but not in real time to simplify the numerical computation the residual breaking strength during the qth year is calculated as follows 31 t b q t b 0 q 1 t b 0 1 i 1 q 1 d i q 2 where t b0 is the initial breaking strength of the mooring line d q is the fatigue damage of the mooring line during the ith year and t b q is the residual breaking strength of the mooring line during the qth year in return the decrease in breaking tension will accelerate the mooring line fatigue damage accumulation eq 22 can be rewritten as follows 32 d q n t k t b m q 0 t r m f t r d t r 4 2 reliability analysis method based on multi failure modes the resistance and load effect of a mooring system are correlated with each other as shown in fig 1 a mooring system s failure limit state function considering the floater offset excess mooring line breakage and fatigue damage can be written as follows 33 z s y s g s y s x min g o g b g f in which x y y 0 t t l d f b k thus the failure probability of the mooring system is as follows 34 p s y s p z s y s 0 p z o 0 z b 0 z f 0 failure probability of the mooring system until it has worked q years is as follows 35 p s y s l q p z o 1 0 z o 2 0 z o q 0 z b 1 0 z b 2 0 z b q 0 z f l q 0 the derivate of the joint distribution of the variables is difficult to analytically derive because the correlations between the responses and load responses is complex the exact calculation of the failure probability of the system is typically quite difficult if at all possible nowak and collins 2012 thus in this research the monte carlo method is adopted and the flowchart is shown in fig 2 5 numerical study in this section the reliability analysis is described for the mooring system of a deep water semi submersible platform failure probabilities of different single modes and a combined case are assessed and the results from the proposed method are compared with those of conventional methods 5 1 numerical model of a semi submersible platform and mooring system the numerical model of the coupled platform mooring system established in this research is shown in fig 3 the platform is double symmetrical about the x and y axis and its particular dimensions are as follows the total length is 114 07 m the width is 79 m and the draft is 18 m with a displacement of 52 275 t the catenary mooring system consists of 12 lines divided into 4 groups each group of mooring lines is 90 apart with 3 lines 5 apart in each corner four groups of the mooring line are centered at 45 135 225 and 315 respectively each mooring line is composed of three components in a chain wire chain configuration the components of each mooring line at the fairlead and anchor adopted a stud link chain and the spiral strand wire is between the two segments of chain links the physical properties of the mooring lines are tabulated in table 2 and table 3 lists the mooring system configuration 5 2 environmental condition in the simulation the short term sea state is modeled using the jonswap spectrum and the long term sea state is described by the north atlantic ocean scatter diagram as listed in table 4 the short term responses of the semi submersible platform motion and mooring line tension are calculated in the time domain for every sea state the long term statistical characteristics during 1 year can be studied by superimposing the short term results of all the sea states in the wave scatter diagram for an extreme response of the mooring line tension and floater offset an extreme sea state with a 1 year return period is needed and it can be predicted by the joint distribution function of the significant wave height and spectral peak period f h s t p there are several long term statistical models described in the literature such as those of haver and nyhus 1986 and mathisen and bitner gregersen 1990 in this work the haver nyhus formulation is adopted as follows 36 f h s t p f h s f t p h s where the marginal probability density function of h s is given as follows 37 f h s 1 2 π ξ h s exp ln h s μ h 2 2 ξ 2 if h s η ˆ β ρ h s ρ β 1 exp h s ρ β if h s η ˆ the conditional probability density function of t p is 38 f t p h s 1 2 π σ t p exp i n t p μ t 2 2 σ 2 39 μ t h s a 1 a 2 h s a 3 σ 2 h s b 1 b 2 exp b 3 h s b 4 in these functions ξ μ h η p β a 1 a 2 a 3 b 1 b 2 b 3 and b 4 are the experienced parameters and vary within different sea areas for the present research these parameters are estimated using the least square method according to the data in the wave scatter diagram as shown in table 4 ξ μ h η ˆ β and ρ are estimated as 0 751 1 03 2 35 1 67 and 3 45 respectively based on the data in the rightmost column of table 4 the fitting result is shown in fig 4 similarly a 1 a 2 a 3 b 1 b 2 b 3 and b 4 are estimated as 1 21 0 974 0 140 0 159 0 130 0 0119 and 2 32 respectively based on the data in each row of table 4 fig 5 shows the fitting results of the conditional probability density function of t p for different significant wave heights it seems that the fitted curve underestimates the probability near the peak particularly for the large significant wave height however it is gratifying that the position of the peaks of the sample and the fitted curve are nearly the same every short term state is considered as a 3 h process such that the exceedance probability of the wave condition with a return period of 1 year is 3 365 24 3 42 10 4 according to eq 37 the annual extreme significant wave height is 11 98 m then the most likely spectral peak period can be obtained as 11 4 s using through eq 38 and it is the position of the peak of the conditional probability density curve as shown in fig 6 5 3 floater mooring dynamic responses and distribution characteristics the semi submersible platform model is built using the sesam genie software published by the dnv gl the wetted surface of the platform hull is described with panel elements while the bracing and mooring lines as small dimensional structures are modeled with the morrison elements then the first and second order hydrodynamic coefficients of the floater are calculated using the sesam wadam software and exported to the sesam deepc software for coupled dynamic analysis after that the floater response and mooring line tension time histories under the 73 sea states of the wave scatter diagram and under the annual extreme wave condition are treated as the database for fatigue damage assessment and multi mode reliability analysis 5 3 1 probability distribution of the annual extreme horizontal offset and mooring line tension the annual extreme platform offset and mooring line tension are obtained from the analysis under the annual extreme wave condition as described in subsection 5 2 coupled simulations of the floater and mooring system with a typical 3 h duration are conducted 30 times for the annual extreme wave condition from each simulation the maximum value is detected as one extreme sample and finally the distributions of the annual extreme floater offset and mooring line tension are both determined as a weibull distribution as shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively through distribution fitting and comparing 5 3 2 probability distribution of the mooring line tension ranges generally the weibull distribution is the most commonly used approach for long term distribution of offshore structural response ranges however because of the strong nonlinearity of the coupled system and the environmental loads the weibull distribution does not agree well with the actual statistical result of the mooring line tension ranges li et al 2016 to conduct a realistic long term mooring line tension amplitude simulation gamma distribution is introduced here fig 9 shows that the gamma distribution seems to reasonably agree with the long term statistical distribution of the mooring line tension amplitudes 5 4 reliability analysis of the mooring system the failure probability of the mooring system is evaluated by means of monte carlo simulation considering the probabilistic description of the random variables in the input and output in which 107 simulations of the mooring system service life are conducted these simulations take approximately 15 min using a 32 core computer with an e 5 central processing unit at a main frequency of 3 20 ghz 5 4 1 failure probability of the mooring system based on an independent assumption in this subsection the three failure modes of the mooring system are assumed to be independent from each other as shown in fig 10 and they are compared with the proposed method in section 5 4 2 fig 11 shows the failure probability of the mooring system for the independent failure modes for the offset failure mode the resistance is a constant which is often provided by the owner and designer of the platform mooring system and the responses during different years are independent from each other as a consequence the annual offset failure probability in each year is same theoretically and the cumulative offset failure probability nearly linearly increases as shown in fig 11 the probability of breaking is slightly greater than the offset during the first few years but it is gradually outpaced the slow increasing rate of the breaking failure probability in the late years can be explained as follows the breaking strength of the 107 mooring systems obeys log normal distribution and once a mooring system is chosen its resistance for every failure mode is deterministic the extreme tensions for these mooring systems are independent with their breaking strength the mooring system with a weaker breaking strength fails at a higher probability during the first few years whereas for the rest intact mooring systems normally have greater breaking strength however the extreme tension doesn t increase thus the number of newly failed mooring systems during the last years is much lower than that during the first few years from the perspective of the entire service life fatigue failure is the most severe of the three failure modes during the first few years the fatigue failure probability is nearly same with that of the other two failure modes however the fatigue damage of the mooring system cumulates annually and the failure probability rapidly increases in addition the increasing rate of failure probability is increasingly greater with years based on the assumption that the three failure modes are independent from each other the combined failure probability can be calculated using eq 30 and it is higher than every single failure mode because of the serial relation of the failure modes the failure probability of the mooring system is 4 7 10 3 when the operation time is 25 years while the failure probability of the mooring system for fatigue breaking and offset is only 2 4 10 3 8 6 10 4 and 1 4 10 3 respectively it can be concluded that the failure probability of the mooring system is significantly underestimated if only one failure mode is considered in the reliability design 5 4 2 failure probability of the mooring system based on the proposed model in this section the failure probability of the mooring system is described using the proposed model as shown in figs 1 and 2 the average fatigue damage during different operation years is shown in fig 12 which indicates that the annual fatigue damage significantly increases with operation year this result can be explained by the accumulation of fatigue damage reducing the breaking strength as shown in eq 31 and the reduction of the breaking strength can increase the annual fatigue damage in return as described in eq 22 for a certain failure mode the difference between the calculated failure probability and the independent case is mainly caused by considering the relation of the breaking strength and cumulative fatigue damage in the proposed method as a result it can be concluded that the offset failure probability is the same as the independent case while the failure probabilities of fatigue damage and breakage determined using the proposed model significantly increased as shown in fig 13 comparing figs 11 13 the breaking and fatigue failure probability in the independent case is underestimated by 53 1 and 26 8 respectively for the combined failure probability to intensively observe the effect of the dependence between the different failure modes the underestimation proportion for failure probability of the mooring system in the independent state is listed in table 5 table 5 shows that the failure probability of the mooring system is obviously underestimated when the correlation is neglected and the underestimation proportion increases annually with the accumulation of fatigue damage and decrease in the breaking strength for the entire design life the failure probability is underestimated by greater than 27 which may lead to considerable safety risk that cannot be ignored 5 4 3 parametric sensitivity analysis as described in section 5 4 2 fatigue damage is the most important aspect of the three failure modes thus in this subsection the contribution of the fatigue damage to the mooring system is described and sensitivity analysis of the system failure probability for the related parameter fatigue exponent m is conducted because the ratio of the mooring line tension range to the breaking tension is less than 1 the smaller the parameter m the larger the increase in fatigue damage as shown in fig 14 at the same time because of the mutually reinforcing effect of the fatigue damage and the breaking strength the growth rate of the increasing proportion of the annual fatigue damage is higher when the value of m is smaller the failure probability of the mooring system is significantly affected by the value of m as shown in fig 15 the failure probability in the independent case is more seriously underestimated when m is smaller the underestimation percentage is greater than 60 when the value of m is 2 8 but is only approximately 10 when m is 3 2 the smaller the m the more attention should be paid to the correlation between the different failure modes this can be explained by the effect of m on the mooring line breaking strength and fatigue damage a smaller m leads to greater fatigue damage which decreases the breaking strength which leads to greater fatigue damage in return 6 conclusions the reliability of a mooring system used for a deep water semi submersible platform was investigated during the reliability analysis three failure modes including floater offset mooring line breakage and fatigue damage were considered as well as the quantitative relation between the mooring line breaking strength and cumulative fatigue damage the failure probability of the mooring system assessed using the proposed method was presented and compared with the results of the conventional independent method the following conclusions can be drawn from the present study 1 through statistical analysis of the response time trace obtained from the coupled dynamic analysis in the time domain the probability density of the annual maximum floater offset and mooring line tension are both well described by the weibull distribution and the mooring line tension range obeys a gamma distribution 2 fatigue failure is the most important mode among the three common failure modes assessed in this study and the failure probability considering the three failure modes as independent and serial is much greater than that of any single mode 3 consideration of the relation of the breaking strength and the cumulative fatigue damage accelerates the increase in fatigue damage and decrease in the mooring line breaking strength the failure probabilities of fatigue damage and breakage are significantly greater than in the case neglecting the relation of the breaking strength and cumulative fatigue damage 4 ignoring the correlation between the three failure modes and the quantitative relation between the mooring line breaking strength and cumulative fatigue damage leads to significant underestimation of the failure probability of the mooring system the underestimated proportion is greater than 27 for the operation lifecycle in this numerical example and should be paid attention during system design 5 the effect of consideration of multiple failure modes on the reliability analysis of the mooring system is affected by the fatigue exponent m a decrease in m leads to a greater underestimation acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the support by the national natural science foundation of china 51709247

dynamic model colregs predictive control beetle antennae search 1 introduction ship collision avoidance has been always a hot topic in maritime safety area zhao 1996 which has attracted a lot of attention in the maritime industry recently with the introduction of the concept of the intelligent ship yun and wei 2017 thieme et al 2018 advanced theories and methods such as expert system sosnin 2009 lee and rhee 2001 fuzzy control zhao et al 1995 hong et al 1999b a perera et al 2012 line of sight guidance wilson et al 2003 genetic algorithm kim et al 2017 tsou et al 2010 evidence reasoning zhao et al 2016 neural network simsir et al 2014 ahn et al 2012 artificial potential field mousazadeh et al 2018 xue et al 2011 and swarm intelligence optimization algorithm ma et al 2018 lazarowska 2015 tsou and hsueh 2010 have been applied in the studies of automatic collision avoidance in the past decades in this section a survey of the existing ship collision avoidance methods and the related works of the algorithms adopted in this study i e model predictive control and beetle antenna search are introduced 1 1 a survey of ship collision avoidance methods the collision avoidance problems solved by these methods can be briefly divided to two categories traditional path generation methods and intelligent optimization methods 1 1 1 traditional path generation methods path generation can be divided to global path generation and local path generation global path generation methods are represented by grid network based methods e g a and its improved algorithms tanakitkorn et al 2014 ma et al 2014 singh et al 2018 liu et al 2019 local path generation methods are mainly represented by artificial potential field apf and its improved algorithms xue et al 2011 2012 as a heuristic search algorithm a hart et al 1968 considers both the start position and the destination which has global optimality original a algorithm has two main shortcomings i e the low search efficiency with a large grid map and the unsmooth paths with a low resolution grid map cheng et al 2014 hierarchical planning wang et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 is a commonly used approach to deal with low efficiency problem by pre processing a higher level graph before path planning additional cost constraint or post process with respect to the smoothness fernandes et al 2015 song et al 2019 are the commonly used approaches to obtain smooth paths in a apf uses artificial gravitational and repulsive field to model the navigation environment with a small computation kim et al 2011 the generated paths of apf are smoother than those of the grid based methods e g a which are more suitable for ships related works of apf lyu and yin 2018 lazarowska 2018 for ship path planning have been carried out in past years however suffering from local optimum and oscillation mohanan and salgoankar 2018 the original apf is also difficult to be implemented in a practical complex environment in summary path generation methods are relatively mature in ship collision avoidance in spite of this most path generation methods regard the ship as a mass point with less consideration of the inertia and nonlinear dynamics of real ships which needs further research 1 1 2 intelligent optimization methods with the development of intelligent optimization algorithms the quantitative study of ship collision risk based on optimization methods e g fuzzy mathematics neural networks swarm intelligence and machine learning etc has become the trend in ship collision avoidance field szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 fuzzy mathematics hasegawa et al 1989 has been applied in the fuzzy classification and reasoning of ship collision risk for a long time in aspect of fuzzy classification the appropriate membership function is a key issue in hasegawa et al 1989 the triangular and trapezoidal membership functions are proposed to represent different fuzzy variables of collision avoidance parameters in further researches hara and hammer 1993 the subjective feelings of the crew are also considered in fuzzy classification in aspect of fuzzy reasoning perera et al 2011 uses fuzzy maximum first fmf for reasoning and several representative achievements are achieved perera et al 2014 2012 in park et al 2007 a case based reasoning cbr fuzzy mathematical method is also used for collision avoidance and obtained reliable results park and kim 2011 park et al 2007 generally the output of fuzzy mathematics relies on the membership functions set in advance which needs more prior knowledge besides neural networks inaishi and matsumura 1992 is another powerful approach which has the ability to model the uncertain factors in reasoning the ship collision risk generally the neural networks is commonly combined with fuzzy mathematics ahn et al 2012 and expert system es simsir et al 2014 to realize the collision avoidance with the development of computer science swarm intelligence and machine learning methods have become hot topics in ship collision avoidance ant colony optimization aco lazarowska 2014 2015 tsou and hsueh 2010 and particle swarm optimization pso ma et al 2018 naeem et al 2016 chen and huang 2012 liu et al 2017 are the most commonly used swarm intelligence algorithms in ship collision avoidance which can obtain good results with an appropriate fitness function including the collision risk similar to swarm intelligence the model free reinforcement learning methods cheng and zhang 2018 kim et al 2019 shen et al 2019 also attract much attention in ship collision avoidance recently however the relative high computation of swarm intelligence and reinforcement learning methods have become the main barriers in the practical applications in ship collision avoidance generally speaking intelligent optimization methods establish the collision risk model and use a series of optimization algorithms to achieve collision avoidance benefiting from the consideration of the ship collision risk index cri and international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs cockroft and lameijer 2004 most intelligent optimization methods can obtain reasonable collision avoidance results in typical encounter scenarios under the premise of real time ability 1 2 related works of mpc for ship collision avoidance for underactuated surface vessels accurate tracking of the planned path harris et al 1999 is also necessary in a reasonable collision avoidance system if the system does not fully consider the constraints and maneuverability of the ship motion or the real time performance cannot meet the control requirements tran et al 2002 the effect of collision avoidance will become worse which may lead to a large difference between the actual results and the expectation at present it is still difficult to realize effective automatic collision avoidance in consideration of constraints ship s maneuvering characteristics and colregs as an effective method to deal with the control constraints model predictive control mpc method has the characteristics of rolling prediction and on line optimization zheng et al 2014 which is more suitable for real ship control with large inertia and hysteresis zhang et al 2017 in the field of collision avoidance distributed model predictive control dmpc method zheng et al 2017 negenborn and maestre 2014 has already been used in multi agent cooperative collision avoidance to solve the problem of motion conflict between multi autonomous individuals zheng et al 2017 has proposed a novel cost effective robust distributed control approach for waterborne autonomous guided vessels agvs which models the price of robustness by explicitly considering uncertainty and system characteristics in a tube based robust control framework dai et al 2017 has also applied dmpc to multi uav motion planning and the virtual state trajectory with compatibility constraints is used to guide the multi uav motion planning instead of the real trajectory which guarantees the stability of the whole system in perizzato et al 2015 dmpc is introduced into the collision avoidance of multi autonomous ground robots and the path planning of multi robot is realized with external and internal collision avoidance constraints in the aspect of ship collision avoidance scholars mainly regard the ship domain model as a constraint condition of mpc to solve the collision avoidance problem abdelaal et al 2016 have proposed a path tracking and collision avoidance method based on nonlinear mpc nmpc with elliptical ship domain and applied the method to a 3 dof ship model after that a disturbance observer is introduced in the controller to realize the effective control and collision avoidance under uncertain disturbances abdelaal et al 2018 1 3 related works of bas algorithm stochastic optimization algorithms such as grey wolf optimization algorithm gwo yao et al 2016 ant colony optimization aco algorithm bououden et al 2015 particle swarm optimization pso algorithm chen et al 2018 wang et al 2018b etc are widely used in complex optimization tasks e g the dynamic programming in mpc among them the pso algorithm is most commonly used in various optimization problems due to its simple structure and fast convergence as a novel stochastic optimization algorithm similar to pso beetle antenna search bas algorithm is proposed in 2017 jiang and li 2018 which has a more concise search strategy based on the foraging behavior of beetles the effectivenesses of bas based algorithms have been validated in various optimization problems wang et al 2018a sun et al 2019 lin et al 2018 lin and li 2018 lin et al 2018 use the bas algorithm to solve the pid fine tuning problem of the double closed loop dc motor speed regulator sun et al 2019 propose a bas based fine tuning method for the back propagation neural network bpnn wu et al 2019 propose a novel fall back bas algorithm for collision free path planning due to the concise search strategy bas based algorithms are considered to have great potential in solving optimization problems in mpc 1 4 contributions and outlines although rich achievements have been obtained there still exists several main drawbacks in existing ship collision avoidance methods 1 most of the path generation methods take fewer considerations of the ship maneuverability which may lead to a large gap between the actual collision avoidance results and the expectation 2 existing real time optimization based methods usually use static maneuvering characteristics e g the turning radius and maximum heading change to set constraints and realize real time collision avoidance by a delayed feedback which cannot foresee the potential collisions 3 the premature and local optimum problems in optimization algorithms e g the pso and bas also affects the collision avoidance results in addition the widely used ship hydrodynamic model has plenty of parameters which also has influences on the real time performance of collision avoidance in this study a simplified 3 degree of freedom 3 dof ship model is established and a predictive collision avoidance method is proposed based on mpc and an improved bas algorithm the main contributions of this study are briefly summarized as follows 1 a simplified 3 dof ship model is proposed by ignoring higher order terms of the abkowitz model for collision avoidance which reduces the complexity for prediction and optimization 2 a predictive collision avoidance strategy derived from mpc is proposed to give full considerations of ship maneuverability and real time ability which can predict potential collision risks and obtain feedback from the environment simultaneously 3 in order to solve the nonlinear optimization problem in mpc better the original bas algorithm is improved in this study based on antenna performances to defect the local optimum problem the remainder of this article is organized as follows in section 2 a simplified 3 dof motion model based on abkowitz model is proposed in section 3 a predictive collision avoidance strategy based on the simplified model colregs and predictive control method is designed in section 4 an improved bas algorithm is proposed and the convergence of the proposed method is analyzed theoretically in section 5 ship collision avoidance experiments under typical encounter scenarios are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparisons with the original bas algorithm in section 7 conclusions and further research are presented 2 simplified 3 dof ship dynamic model the 3 dof motion coordinate system of a underactuated surface vessel is shown in fig 1 here o o x o y o is the inertial coordinate system of the vessel o x y is the co rotational coordinate system of the vessel u v and r are the velocities in surge body fixed x sway body fixed y and yaw directions respectively δ and ψ are the rudder and heading angle of the vessel respectively β is the drift angle then the 3 dof hydrodynamic model can be obtained as shown in eq 1 1 m u v r x g r 2 x m v u r x g r 2 y i z r m x g v u r n where m is the total mass of the vessel x g is the longitudinal coordinate of the gravity center of the vessel in surge direction i z is the moment of the inertia x y and n are the hydrodynamics of the vessel in 3 dof directions respectively 2 1 abkowitz hydrodynamic model abkowitz model is obtained by mechanical analysis of the ship as a whole object including rudder and propeller zhang and zou 2011 the hydrodynamics on the right side of eq 1 are expanded as shown in eq 2 2 m x u u f 1 u v r δ m y v v m x g y r r f 2 u v r δ m x g n v v i z z n r r f 3 u v r δ where f 1 f 2 and f 3 are the integrations of the coupling multiplication the square terms of u v r and δ and the lift drag terms furthermore this model can be organized into a state space form 3 u f x δ u δ v δ r δ δ v f y δ u δ v δ r δ δ r f n δ u δ v δ r δ δ where δ u δ v δ r and δ δ are the changes of the state variable u v r and δ f x f y and f n are the high order polynomials of the state 2 2 simplified hydrodynamic model based on the real time requirement of ship collision avoidance the parameters in the original abkowitz model need to be simplified under the premise of guaranteeing the accuracy of the model and the assumption that the hull is left right symmetrical some higher order terms in the right of eq 3 can be ignored 1 surge direction the main force in the surge direction of a ship is the propeller s thrust which is directly proportional to the square of the propeller s speed so x 0 x n n n 2 is used to represent the propulsion force and the rest terms unrelated to δ u are kept to 2nd order 4 f x

underactuated ship is sailing directly under a constant speed δ v δ r 0 and the rudder angle δ δ δ 0 the force is balanced in the sway direction where δ 0 is the needed rudder angle to keep the heading directly so the changes of δ u δ v δ r or δ δ will make contributions to the force in sway direction considering that the changes of δ u and δ δ have greater influences on the force in sway direction terms which are only related to δ v and δ r are kept to 1st order and terms which are related to δ u and δ δ are kept to 3rd order 5 f y y u u δ u 2 y v δ v u 0 y r δ r u 0 y δ δ δ u 0 2 y δ

is similar to the parameters in sway direction 6 f n n u u δ u 2 n v δ v u 0 n r δ r u 0 n δ δ δ u 0 2 n δ δ δ δ δ 3 u 0 2 n v v δ δ v 2 δ δ n v δ δ δ v δ δ 2 u 0 n δ u δ δ δ u u 0 n v u δ v δ u n r u δ r δ u n δ u u δ δ δ u 2 then the states of the motion model are redefined as 7 x δ u u 0 δ u 2 δ u 3 u 0 δ v 2 δ r 2 δ δ 2 u 0 2 δ δ 2 δ u u 0 δ v δ r δ v δ δ u 0 δ v δ δ δ u n 2 11 1 t y δ u 2 δ v

δ δ δ u 2 11 1 t where x y and n are the redefined states then the motion model in eq 3 can be rewritten as 8 u v r a x 0 0 0 a y 0 0 0 a n x y n where a x a y and a n are the coefficient matrices to be identified in addition the relationship model between x y ψ and u v r is shown in eq 9 9 x y ψ sin ψ cos ψ 0 cos ψ sin ψ 0 0 0 1 u v r then the following simplified 3 dof state model can be obtained by combining eqs 8 and 9 10 x s f x s x s u v r x y ψ t f x s θ x y n d x d y d ψ t θ d i a g a x a y a n 1 1 1 d x u sin ψ v cos ψ d y u cos ψ v cos ψ d ψ r where f is the derivation function of the lumped state x s after the parameter matrix θ in eq 10 is identified completely the final 3 dof model can be used for ship state prediction 3 collision avoidance based on predictive control the proposed simplified model in eq 10 is used to predict the future states of the ship motion then the ship collision risks in different encounter scenarios in finite time horizon are calculated based on the predicted states of the own ship and the target ship finally both the safety factor collision risk and the economic factor control changes are considered comprehensively to form the optimization problem of collision avoidance 3 1 model discretization and risk prediction in view of that the computer can only process discrete data it is necessary to discrete the continuous state model in eq 10 to minimize the loss of model accuracy the widely used runge kutta wambecq 1978 method is adopted in the discretization for the own ship the following step by step prediction equations can be obtained based on runge kutta 11 x s t 1 f s x s t f s x s t x s t h 6 k 1 2 k 2 2 k 3 k 4 k 1 f x s t k 2 f x s t h 2 k 1 k 3 f x s t h 2 k 2 k 4 f x s t h k 3 where f s is the discretization form of the derivation function f h is the discretization step k 1 k 4 are the derivation function values of f at different moments in one step in this paper we focus on the situation that the own ship is the give way ship and the target ship is the stand on ship which has no sway velocity v and yaw velocity r therefore the lumped state of target ship is 12 x t u t 0 0 x t y t ψ t t where u t is the surge velocity of the target ship x t and y t are the inertial coordinates of the target ship ψ t is the heading of the target ship then the derivation function of x t is simplified as 13 f x t u t 0 0 u t sin ψ t u t cos ψ t 0 t based on eq 13 the discretization state model of the target ship can be obtained by replacing x s and the function f in eq 11 with x t and f respectively 14 x t t 1 f t x t t where f t is the discretization form of f after the discretization of the own ship and the target ship the encounter parameters i e relative position body fixed θ t real relative position α t relative velocity v r and the direction of the relative velocity ψ r can be calculated by geometric method as shown in fig 2 furthermore the distance at closest point of approach dcpa and the time to closest point of approach tcpa are calculated as shown in eq 15 15 d c p a r t sin ψ r α t π t c p a r t cos ψ r α t π v r then the collision risk between two ships at time t can be obtained based on fuzzy mathematic method 16 f c r i t λ d c p a λ t c p a λ r t λ θ t λ k u d c p a t u t c p a t u r t t u θ t t u k t t where f c r i is the collision risk u d c p a t u t c p a t u r t t u θ t t and u k t are the membership functions of d c p a t c p a r t θ t and the ship speed ratio k at time t which are calculated based on the widely used ship risk model in zheng and wu 2002 λ d c p a λ t c p a λ r t λ θ t and λ k are the set weights of the membership functions which are usually set as 0 400 0 367 0 133 0 067 and 0 033 respectively in addition a negative tcpa indicates that the two ships have passed each other and the collision risk f c r i should be close to zero therefore an additional condition is set to eliminating the impacts of residual dcpa and tcpa 17 λ d c p a λ t c p a 0 i f tcpa 0 assuming that the implicit function between the collision risk and the ship states is f c r i t γ x s t x t t which can be obtained by eqs 11 16 the prediction equation of the collision risk in a prediction horizon is 18 f c r i t f c r i t 1 f c r i t 2 f c r i t n p t γ f s x s t f t x t t γ f s f s x s t f t f t x t t γ f s f s n p x s t f t f t n p x t t where n p is the prediction horizon f c r i t is the final prediction collision risk at time t 3 2 constraint condition according to the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs cockroft and lameijer 2004 the encounter scenarios can be divided to three typical categories i e head on crossing and overtaking based on the relative position of the target ship as shown in fig 3 the colregs stipulate that the own ship is the give way ship and has the duty of steering to avoid collision in head on and starboard crossing encounter scenarios otherwise the own ship is the stand on ship and should keep its course and speed when the own ship is the give way ship it is recommended to turn right in head on rule 14 and starboard crossing scenarios rule 15 in addition the own ship is also recommended as the give way ship when the own ship wants to overtake other ships rule 13 based on the above advices the following constraint conditions for rudder angle are set in different relative position θ t 19 0 δ δ max i f 355 θ t 360 0 θ t 112 5 δ max δ δ max i f 112 5 θ t 355 where δ max is the maximum angle of the rudder actuator then the constraint conditions can ensure that the collision avoidance decisions conform to the rules as far as possible under different encounter scenarios in addition the actuator of a real ship also has constraints in maximum rudder angle speed the following condition is set on the rudder angle changes 20 δ δ t δ δ max δ δ t δ t δ t 1 δ δ max h δ max where δ t is the rudder angle at time t h is the control period δ max is the maximum rudder angle speed 3 3 optimization problem reasonable objective function is very important in the application of model predictive control to ship collision avoidance generally both the safety cost and economic cost are considered in existing researches in this study the actual rudder angle is chosen as the control variable to be optimized the target is to minimize the predictive collision risks f t and the rudder changes 21 j p δ p μ 1 f t μ 2 f δ δ p t f δ δ t δ δ p t 1 δ δ p t n p δ δ p i 1 δ p i 1 δ p i i 1 n p where μ 1 and μ 2 are the weights of the safety cost and economic cost respectively represents for 2 norms function f δ δ p is the cost for rudder changes δ p is the predictive input sequence in prediction horizon n p therefore the collision avoidance method based on predictive control can be described as the following optimization problem 22 arg min δ p j p δ p s t eqs 11 14 18 19 20 after solving the above optimization problem at time t the first value of the input sequence δ p is taken as the actual rudder angle i e δ t 1 δ p t 1 which is used for motion control in the control horizon n c generally in order to reflect the prediction effect n c n p is adopted 3 4 re sailing and stand on since the collision states e g the dcpa tcpa etc will change during the voyage the ship is considered to be re sailed back to the route if there is no collision risk moreover the give way ship may change to a stand on ship after collision avoidance measures are taken which requires a stable course angle and speed based on colregs in order to solve the course keeping and re sailing problem at the same time the widely used line of sight los guidance strategy liu et al 2018 is adopted in this study to transform the re sailing problem to a course keeping problem then a pid controller is used to keep the course of the ship assuming that the pid inputs for re sailing and stand on scenarios are δ r e and δ s t respectively the final input for the entire voyage of the ship is determined by the following switching strategy 23 i f f c r i t f c r i min t c p a 0 δ t δ r e t e l s e i f 112 5 θ t 355 δ t δ s t t e l s e δ t δ p t where f c r i min is a set minimum threshold for the collision risk f c r i δ p t is the calculated input result of mpc in section 3 3 4 improved bas algorithm for collision avoidance at present swarm intelligence and evolution algorithms i e genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso and ant colony search algorithm aco have been applied in nonlinear optimization problems successfully however the essence of this kind of stochastic optimization methods represented by pso is using a certain population of species to share the optimal value according to some strategy when the population size is large the prediction process in eq 18 in each iteration consumes a large amount of time which is disadvantaged to rapidly solving of collision avoidance problem the beetle antennae search bas algorithm is a highly efficient optimization algorithm proposed in 2017 compared with the pso search algorithm only one individual is needed in bas i e a beetle which has the characteristics of small calculation fast convergence and strong global optimization ability 4 1 original bas algorithm from eq 22 it can be seen that the parameters to be optimized are the control sequence δ p δ p 1 δ p 2 δ p n p and the search dimension is the prediction horizon n p then the steps of the original bas algorithm are summarized as follows step 1 define two n p dimensional vectors x l and x r as the left and the right antenna of the beetle respectively then use x and d s represents the centroid of the beetle and the distance between the antennae respectively after the initial values of δ p are assigned to the centroid x calculate the initial cost value and regard it as the current minimum cost j p min step 2 assuming that the direction of the beetle antennae is random which can be represented by a random vector dir r a n d n p 1 from the right antenna to the left antenna then calculate the two antennae with the normalization of dir is d dir n o r m dir as 24 x l x d s d 2 x r x d s d 2 where d s can be also regarded as the exploring step of two antennae then choose x l or x r crosswise based on eq 24 for multi step control simulation in prediction horizon and collect the motion data of the ships to calculate the objective function values j p x x l and j p x x r by eq 21 step 3 if j p x x l j p x x r then make the beetle run a fixed distance l s t e p k d s toward the left direction that is x x l s t e p d if j p x x l j p x x r then make the beetle run a fixed distance l s t e p k d s toward the right direction that is x x l s t e p d then the unified equation using symbolic function s g n is 25 x x s g n j p x x r j p x x l l s t e p d step 4 when the centroid of the beetle x is updated choose it for control simulation and recalculate the cost j p x at the same time then compare j p x with the current minimum cost j p b e s t to update the optimal parameters x b e s t and the minimum cost function value j p b e s t by greedy strategy 26 j p b e s t j p x x b e s t x i f f b a s x j p b e s t at this point one search iteration of bas is completed execute step 2 4 circularly until the end of the iterations or the time when the minimum cost meets the requirement step 5 adopt the first value of x b e s t as the rudder input to control the own ship in control horizon i e δ t x b e s t 1 and repeat step 1 5 until the end of the collision avoidance in addition fig 4 shows the flow chart of the bas algorithm for better illustration a simplified beetle in 2 dof is used to visualize the search process and the geometric distance in 2 dof space is regarded as the fitness function as can be seen from fig 4 the beetle becomes closer to the theoretical optimum after exploring in an iteration and the left flow shows the details of the bas algorithm 4 2 improved bas algorithm for constrained problem although the original bas algorithm is more concise in search strategy and requires less calculation cost than pso it is still a stochastic optimization method without changing the optimization object when the calculation cost of the model prediction increases the real time performance of the search algorithm will be reduced therefore more reasonable initialization and the update strategy of the parameters can improve the search efficiency to a certain extent 4 2 1 searching strategy improvement it can be seen from eq 24 that the left and right antennae of the beetle are always searched from both sides of the centroid x which cannot make full use of the historical trajectories of the two antennae in the search process even if the step size l s t e p changes the locations of the two antennae are always constrained by the position of the current centroid x which is easy to fall into local extremum in case of only one individual therefore the local optimal positions of two antennae and the corresponding optimal objective function values are introduced to improve the search strategy using the update strategy of pso for references eq 24 is modified as 27 x l x l b e s t d s d 2 x r x r b e s t d s d 2 where x l b e s t and x r b e s t are the historical optimal parameters of the left antenna and right antenna respectively after the two antennae have been searched based on eq 27 the x l b e s t and x r b e s t are updated as 28 j p l b e s t j p x x l x l b e s t x l i f j p x x l j p l b e s t j p r b e s t j p x x r x r b e s t x r i f j p x x r j p r b e s t where j p l b e s t and j p r b e s t are the historical optimal objective function values of the left and right antennae respectively referring to the strategy of particle velocity updating in pso x l b e s t and x r b e s t are used to correct the centroid position x in each iteration as 29 x x s g n j p x x r j p x x l l s t e p d c l r d x l b e s t x c r r d x r b e s t x where r d 0 1 is a random value c l and c r are the defined learning factors of the left antenna and right antenna respectively in general c l and c r should be determined by the historical optimal cost j p l b e s t and j p r b e s t in the search process if j p l b e s t is smaller than j p r b e s t it is considered that the current optimal position of the left antenna is closer to the global optimal position then c l c r should be satisfied and vice versa therefore the following c l and c r are selected 30 c l λ j p r b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t c r λ j p l b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t where represents the 2 norms function 0 λ 1 is the set positive constant which is similar to the weight of particle velocity in pso 4 2 2 parameters initialization in the improved strategy the centroid x is no longer restricted to the two antennae which is also affected by the introduced local optimal values x l b e s t and x r b e s t then the initialization of x l b e s t and x r b e s t should be more reliable at present most of the stochastic search algorithms use a set of random values in the search space as the initial parameters without prior knowledge nevertheless for the optimization problem in eq 22 the parameters to be optimized are the sequence of ship rudder angles in the predicted horizon which have strong continuities in a limited horizon restricted by the constrains and large inertia of the ship and the actual actuator therefore the optimal values should be changed continuously and the initial values of x l b e s t and x r b e s t can be set to the fixed values according to the constrains of rudder angle without losing generality the original problem is simplified to a 1 dof space search problem for parameter initialization analyze the learning term produced by the introduced x l b e s t and x r b e s t in eq 29 is 31 δ x c l r d x l b e s t x c r r d x r b e s t x λ r d j p r b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t x l b e s t j p l b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t x r b e s t x where δ x represents the learning term then a learning object x l r can be defined as 32 x l r j p r b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t x l b e s t j p l b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t x r b e s t from eq 32 it can be seen that the improved beetle runs a further distance to the position of x l r in each iteration compared with original bas assuming that the theoretical optimal position is x b e s t the maximum distance between x l r and x b e s t should be as small as possible generally the initial values of x l b e s t and x r b e s t have two relative positions as shown in fig 5 1 when both x l b e s t and x r b e s t are on the same side of x b e s t the upper limit of the distance between initial x and x r b e s t is determined by the constraint area of the side on which x l b e s t and x r b e s t are located assuming that the constraint of x is x x min x max then the maximum distance between x l r and x b e s t occurs when x l b e s t x r b e s t x min or x l b e s t x r b e s t x max 33 d 1 max x b e s t x min x max x b e s t where d 1 is the maximum distance between x l r and x b e s t if both x l b e s t and x r b e s t are on the same side of x b e s t 2 when x l b e s t and x r b e s t are on the opposite sides of x b e s t the maximum distance d 2 between x l r and x b e s t occurs when x l b e s t x min x r b e s t x b e s t or x l b e s t x b e s t x r b e s t x max 34 d 2 max x b e s t a r x min 1 a r x b e s t x max a r x b e s t 1 a r x max max a r x b e s t x min 1 a r x max x b e s t max x b e s t x min x max x b e s t d 1 a r j p r b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t where d 2 is the maximum distance between x l r and x b e s t if x l b e s t and x r b e s t are on the opposite sides of x b e s t based on eq 34 x l b e s t x min and x r b e s t x max are set for initialization to make sure that the x l b e s t and x r b e s t are located on the opposite sides of x b e s t respectively furthermore the following initial values of x l b e s t and x r b e s t are set combined with eq 19 35 x l b e s t i i 1 2 n p δ max x r b e s t i i 1 2 n p δ max i f 112 5 θ t 355 x l b e s t i i 1 2

needs to be analyzed stability analysis based on linear time invariant discrete systems is a common method for this kind of stochastic search algorithm in this section the range of learning factor λ introduced in the improved bas algorithm is analyzed based on this method firstly combining eqs 29 and 30 we get 36 x x s g n j p x x r j p x x l l s t e p d λ j p r b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t r d x l b e s t x λ j p l b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t r d x r b e s t x for the convenience of analysis the direction d in eq 27 and fitness function values j p r b e s t and j p r b e s t are regarded as discrete variables without loss of generality make 37 φ 1 t j p r b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t φ 2 t s g n j p x x r j p x x l d then the discrete form of eq 37 is 38 x t 1 x t l s t e p t 1 φ 2 t λ φ 1 t r d x l b e s t x λ 1 φ 1 t r d x r b e s t x 1 λ φ 1 t r d 1 φ 1 t r d x t l s t e p t 1 φ 2 t λ φ 1 t r d x l b e s t λ 1 φ 1 t r d x r b e s t to simplify the calculation the random values r d behind the two learning factors are set the same then eq 38 is simplified to 39 x t 1 1 λ x t l s t e p t 1 φ 2 t φ 3 t φ 3 t λ φ 1 t r d x l b e s t λ 1 φ 1 t r d x r b e s t generally the attenuation strategy is widely applied for the step l s t e p in bas 40 τ s t e p t 1 α τ s t e p t l s t e p t τ s t e p t l 0 where α is the attenuation coefficient of l s t e p l 0 is the set minimum step combining eqs 39 and 40 we can get a linear discrete equation 41 z t 1 a t z t b t z t x t τ s t e p t t a t 1 λ α φ 2 t 0 α b t l 0 φ 2 t φ 3 t 0 t assuming that φ φ 1 t φ 2 t φ 3 t is a constant matrix eq 41 is a typical linear time invariant discrete system the necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of the system in eq 41 is that the two eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix a t satisfy the following conditions 42 1 λ 1 α 1 0 λ 2 1 α 1 therefore the following theorem can be summarized theorem 1 the necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of the improved bas algorithm is 0 λ 2 a n d 1 α 1 finally the proposed ship predictive collision avoidance algorithm based on the improved bas is denoted in algorithm 1 4 4 validation on benchmark functions to verify the optimization performance of the improved bas algorithm several benchmark functions are used for optimization tests as shown in table 1 using the original bas algorithm and the widely used linear decreasing weight pso ldwpso algorithm as comparisons considering the real time requirement of on line optimization i e the proposed predictive collision avoidance problem it is necessary to compare both the performance under the same calculation amount and the required calculation amount to achieve the same performance 4 4 1 performance comparisons under the same calculation amount since the original bas and the improved bas algorithm calculate the objective function value three times per iteration left antenna right antenna and centroid the population size of ldwpso is set to 3 the remaining parameters of the algorithms are set as table 2 in view of the uncertainty of stochastic search algorithm 50 groups of repeated experiments are taken for each benchmark and the final optimal function values and convergence times are recorded as shown in figs 6 and 7 the mean values and standard deviations std are further calculated as indicators as shown in table 3 it can be seen from figs 6 7 and table 3 that 1 in terms of the final optimization results both the mean and std of the optimal values of the original bas and ldwpso are at the same level while those of the improved bas are smaller in all benchmarks which indicates that the improved bas algorithm has better performance in the average ability and stability of optimization 2 in terms of the convergence times mean convergence time of the improved bas algorithm are shorter than those of the original bas and ldwpso in all benchmarks which indicated that the average convergence speed of the improved bas algorithm is faster for relative simpler functions i e f 4 f 3 the improved bas algorithm can converge to the optimal value in less than 10 iterations besides the std of the convergence time of the improved bas algorithm are also shorter than those of the original bas and ldwpso in most of the functions except the relative complex function f 1 which shows the advantage of the improved bas algorithm in convergence speed to illustrate the optimization process more intuitively descent curves of fitness and parameter optimization process in a single test are shown in figs 8 and 9 4 4 2 computation comparisons with the same performance since the improved bas and original bas algorithms have the same calculation amount repeated experiments are conducted on the improved bas and ldwpso with population size n 3 6 9 and 12 respectively the mean values of the final optimal results and convergence time are recorded as shown in figs 10 and 11 and the descent curves of the function values in one of the tests are shown in fig 12 the abscissas of each subgraph in figs 10 and 11 are the population sizes of ldwpso it can be seen that both the mean optimal values and the convergence time of ldwpso are gradually reduced with the increase of the population size of ldwpso while the optimal fitness values and the convergence time of the proposed improved bas are still smaller and shorter than those of ldwpso respectively until the population size of ldwpso reaches 12 at this time the computational complexities of ldwpso and improved bas are theoretically o 12 and o 3 and the actual average time cost of ldwpso and improved bas in a single iteration are about 0 31 s and 0 09 s respectively which further indicates that the improved bas could achieve the same optimization performance as ldwpso with less calculation cost 5 simulation experiments simulation experiments are carried out in two aspects 1 maneuverability predictions of zig zag tests and turning test are carried out based on the widely used kvlcc2 ship model and the proposed simplified 3 dof hydrodynamic model for accuracy verification 2 typical encounter scenarios head on crossing over taking etc are set up and the collision avoidance simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed predictive collision avoidance method based on the improved bas 5 1 simplified 3 dof model verification taking the 20 20 zig zag test data of kvlcc2 model as training samples the parameters of the simplified 3 dof model are identified by the widely used least squares support vector machine ls svm as shown in table 4 then the maneuverability predictions of 10 10 20 20 30 30 zig zag tests and 35 left turning test are conducted based on the identified model with parameters in table 4 the comparisons of the prediction results and the actual state of the validation samples i e u v r x y ψ are shown in figs 13 16 and the root mean square errors rsme of the predictions are further calculated as shown in table 5 1 it can be seen from the curves in figs 13 16 that the simplified 3 dof model with the training samples of 20 20 zigzag test can accurately predict the zig zag and turning test data under other rudder angles i e 10 10 and 30 30 2 the results in table 5 show that the simplified model has low precision loss and strong generalization in addition the rmses of each state variable in 10 10 and 30 30 zig zag tests are slightly higher than those in 20 20 zig zag test which indicates that the changes of the maneuverability under different rudder angles has a certain influence on the accuracy of the identified hydrodynamic coefficients this result can be accepted since the proposed simplified model is an abkowitz based model generally speaking the accuracy of the proposed 3 dof simplified model is verified by the small prediction error moreover the prediction error of the ship position can reach under 1 4 of the ship length l p p which basically meets the precision requirements of predictive collision avoidance in a finite time horizon 5 2 collision avoidance experiments the kvlcc2 ship model is used to calculate the ship s real motion state in the simulation experiment and the simplified 3 dof model is used to predict the ship s state in the predictive horizon the control horizon and predictive horizon are set as 1 s and 3 s respectively since the weight of objective function in eq 22 also affects the final collision avoidance effect μ 1 0 9 and μ 2 0 1 are set in the experiments to take more safety cost into account and observe the collision avoidance effect easily in order to form reasonable typical ship encounter scenarios the initial states of the target ship are set based on eq 43 to ensure collisions with the own ship if no measures are taken 43 x t 0 x 0 r sin ψ 0 k r sin ψ 0 θ y t 0 y 0 r cos ψ 0 k r cos ψ 0 θ ψ t 0 ψ 0 θ π u t 0 k u 0 k u v t 0 v 0 0 r t 0 r 0 0 where x 0 y 0 ψ 0 u 0 v 0 r 0 are the initial states of the own ship x t 0 y t 0 ψ t 0 u t 0 v t 0 r t 0 are the initial states of the target ship u is the service speed of the own ship and k is the speed ratio r is the set distance before the collision and θ is the set relative position angle of the target ship by setting different k and θ the target ship will collide with the own ship if no avoidance measures are taken since the scale of the kvlcc2 model ship is 1 45 the distance r is set as r 6 nm 45 287 m in head on and crossing encounters and r 8 nm 45 330 m in overtaking encounter other parameters are set in table 6 for comprehensive verification two crossing encounter scenarios with different position angles are set in this study throughout this section the os and ts in each figure represent the own ship and target ship respectively the cp represents the closest positions of two ships during the collision avoidance besides the minimum collision risk threshold for re sailing is set as f c r i min 0 05 5 2 1 scenario 1 head on the trajectories of the own ship and the target ship in head on encounter are recorded as shown in fig 17 and the real time collision avoidance parameters i e dcpa tcpa actual rudder angle and collision risk are recorded as shown in fig 18 for easy analysis the minimum relative distance mean and maximum of dcpa mean and maximum of collision risk index cri i e f c r i are further calculated as the indicators in table 7 the closest positions cp of the own ship os and the target ship ts are marked with different shapes in the original and the partial enlarged graph in fig 17 it can be seen from the results in table 7 that the minimum distance mean and maximum dcpa of the improved bas based algorithm are obviously larger than those of the original bas furthermore the mean and maximum cri of the improved bas are also smaller than bas which indicates that the improved bas obtains better collision avoidance results than the original bas in addition the initial rudder inputs of the own ship based on the improved bas are more responsive to the potential collision as shown in fig 18 which results in larger dcpa and smaller cri after taking the avoidance measures 5 2 2 scenario 2 crossing both small angle and large angle crossing encounter scenarios on starboard are considered in this section according to fig 3 and 10 and 80 crossing angles are set as in table 6 the trajectories of the two ships in small angle crossing and large angle crossing encounters are shown in figs 19 and 21 respectively the real time collision avoidance parameters in small angle crossing and large angle crossing encounters are recorded as shown in figs 20 and 22 respectively the evaluation indicators of collision avoidance are further calculated in table 8 it can be seen that 1 in aspect of small angle crossing encounter the mean and max cri of the improved bas algorithm 0 034 and 0 487 respectively are both smaller than those of the original bas 0 111 and 0 603 respectively however the initial optimal results of the improved bas are close to the full rudder which results in a larger steering angle and increases the time required for re sailing as shown in the actual trajectories in fig 19 and the rudder changes in fig 20 in addition it can be seen from table 8 that the steering time for collision avoidance is longer in starboard crossing encounter than that in head on encounter which will result in larger dcpa and smaller cri the reason for this phenomenon is that the own ship cannot be relieved of the obligation of collision avoidance until the target ship has moved into the port area under the limitation of colregs which takes more time in starboard crossing encounter 2 in aspect of large angle crossing encounter the simulation results in large angle crossing encounter are very similar to those in small angle crossing encounter the improved bas can obviously obtain larger minimum distance mean and maximum dcpa 189 m 222 m and 269 m respectively than the original bas 73 m 102 m and 151 m respectively in addition as can be seen from the changes of rudder angle and cri in fig 22 that the improved bas adopts a starboard steering much earlier than the original bas which reduces the cri in time with a slight acceleration of the decreasing of tcpa from the trajectories in fig 21 it can be also seen that the trajectory obtained by the improved bas also turns much earlier than that of the original bas which is more obvious than that in small angle crossing encounter therefore the improved bas algorithm can avoid collisions by passing through the stern of the target ship in time and obtains safer avoidance results than the original bas in both small and large angle starboard crossing encounters 5 2 3 scenario 3 overtaking the trajectories of the own ship and the target ship under over taking encounter are shown in fig 23 the collision avoidance parameters are shown in fig 24 and the evaluation indicators are further calculated in table 9 theoretically the evaluate indicators of collision avoidance in overtaking encounter should be similar to those in head on encounter because of the similarity of the relative position between the two ships in overtaking and head on encounters which can be verified by the results from tables 7 and 9 in addition it can be seen from the collision risk curves in fig 24 that the decreasing speed of the cri in over taking encounter is slower than that in the head on encounter since the own ship re sailings to the same course as the target ship after collision avoidance in spite of this the cri is also close to zero in the end of the simulation which indicates the effectiveness of collision avoidance in the over taking encounter 5 2 4 scenario 4 multi ship encounter considering the limitation of colregs and ship maneuverability most of the current researches on multi ship collision avoidance in open waters determine the avoidance order of different target ships by avoiding the current key ship i e the most dangerous ship so as to decompose the multi ship encounters into continuous encounters in this section continuous encounters head on and crossing are set to verify the continuous avoidance ability of the proposed method since the initialization method in typical encounters is not suitable for multi ship encounters the initial states of two target ships are set as shown in table 10 the trajectories of the own ship and the target ships are shown in fig 25 the collision avoidance parameters are shown in fig 26 and the evaluation indicators are further calculated in table 11 it can be seen from the trajectory curves in fig 25 and the data in table 11 that the collision avoidance results between target ship 1 and 2 of the improved bas are effective i e avoiding the two target ships successfully with continuous starboard steering actions while the original bas obtains smaller minimum distance 14 m than the improved bas 33 m with target ship 1 and even fails to avoid target ship 2 moreover as can be seen from fig 26 that the improved bas obtains positive dcpa results with target ship 2 very quickly by continuous starboard steering and the own ship passes through the stern of the target ship 2 effectively which is conformity with the colregs while the original bas does not take the steering actions in time resulting in non positive dcpa results with target ship 2 until the collision happens which indicates the effectiveness of the improvement on the bas algorithm overall from the indicators in table 11 the improved bas obtains larger dcpa and smaller cri results than the original bas e g the mean dcpa and cri with target ship 2 of the improved bas are 114 983 m and 0 080 while those of the original bas are 30 446 m and 0 236 which are similar to the results in typical encounters therefore it can be concluded that the proposed improved bas method also outperforms the original bas in the setting multi ship encounter 6 summary in summary a simplified 3 dof ship dynamic model is introduced and a predictive collision avoidance method is proposed based on model predictive control and an improved beetle antenna search bas algorithm the ship dynamic model is simplified by ignoring several higher order terms in the taylor extensions of the force and moment in abkowitz model then a predictive collision avoidance strategy is proposed by applying the model predictive control method with the simplified ship model and collision risk model in order to solve the optimization problem in the predictive strategy an improved bas algorithm is proposed by improving the searching strategy of the original bas with historical antenna optimums the convergence of the improved bas is analyzed theoretically and the general optimization ability of the improved bas are also verified based on several benchmarks finally the effectiveness of the simplified ship model and the proposed improved bas based predictive collision avoidance method are verified in simulations based on the widely used kvlcc2 ship model 7 conclusions and future works the main works of this paper are concluded as follows 1 with respect to the simplified ship dynamic model the zigzag tests and turning tests results show that the predictions of the proposed simplified 3 dof model are accurate compared with the complete model which indicates the effectiveness of the simplified model 2 with respect to the proposed improved bas algorithm the results in benchmark function tests and ship collision avoidance tests show that the improved bas algorithm outperforms the original bas in both numeral optimization and the predictive ship collision avoidance which indicates the effectiveness of the improvements on bas 3 with respect to the proposed predictive collision avoidance strategy experiment results show that the proposed strategy can realize effective ship collision avoidance in both typical ship encounters and a multi ship encounter which indicates the effectiveness of the predictive strategy with the improved bas algorithm the future works will focus on the following aspects 1 in this study the ship s speed is given by the service speed and the simplified model is also established under the service speed when the speed changes greatly the ship maneuverability will change accordingly therefore a sensitivity analysis of the simplified model parameters under different speeds will be considered in future research to extract the parameters which are sensitive to the speed changes then a possible regression analysis of the important parameters will be carried out on the basis of the sensitivity analysis results 2 since the prediction horizon of the predictive strategy also affects the collision avoidance results in this study in further research different prediction horizons can be set for fine tuning of the proposed method declaration of

dynamic model colregs predictive control beetle antennae search 1 introduction ship collision avoidance has been always a hot topic in maritime safety area zhao 1996 which has attracted a lot of attention in the maritime industry recently with the introduction of the concept of the intelligent ship yun and wei 2017 thieme et al 2018 advanced theories and methods such as expert system sosnin 2009 lee and rhee 2001 fuzzy control zhao et al 1995 hong et al 1999b a perera et al 2012 line of sight guidance wilson et al 2003 genetic algorithm kim et al 2017 tsou et al 2010 evidence reasoning zhao et al 2016 neural network simsir et al 2014 ahn et al 2012 artificial potential field mousazadeh et al 2018 xue et al 2011 and swarm intelligence optimization algorithm ma et al 2018 lazarowska 2015 tsou and hsueh 2010 have been applied in the studies of automatic collision avoidance in the past decades in this section a survey of the existing ship collision avoidance methods and the related works of the algorithms adopted in this study i e model predictive control and beetle antenna search are introduced 1 1 a survey of ship collision avoidance methods the collision avoidance problems solved by these methods can be briefly divided to two categories traditional path generation methods and intelligent optimization methods 1 1 1 traditional path generation methods path generation can be divided to global path generation and local path generation global path generation methods are represented by grid network based methods e g a and its improved algorithms tanakitkorn et al 2014 ma et al 2014 singh et al 2018 liu et al 2019 local path generation methods are mainly represented by artificial potential field apf and its improved algorithms xue et al 2011 2012 as a heuristic search algorithm a hart et al 1968 considers both the start position and the destination which has global optimality original a algorithm has two main shortcomings i e the low search efficiency with a large grid map and the unsmooth paths with a low resolution grid map cheng et al 2014 hierarchical planning wang et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 is a commonly used approach to deal with low efficiency problem by pre processing a higher level graph before path planning additional cost constraint or post process with respect to the smoothness fernandes et al 2015 song et al 2019 are the commonly used approaches to obtain smooth paths in a apf uses artificial gravitational and repulsive field to model the navigation environment with a small computation kim et al 2011 the generated paths of apf are smoother than those of the grid based methods e g a which are more suitable for ships related works of apf lyu and yin 2018 lazarowska 2018 for ship path planning have been carried out in past years however suffering from local optimum and oscillation mohanan and salgoankar 2018 the original apf is also difficult to be implemented in a practical complex environment in summary path generation methods are relatively mature in ship collision avoidance in spite of this most path generation methods regard the ship as a mass point with less consideration of the inertia and nonlinear dynamics of real ships which needs further research 1 1 2 intelligent optimization methods with the development of intelligent optimization algorithms the quantitative study of ship collision risk based on optimization methods e g fuzzy mathematics neural networks swarm intelligence and machine learning etc has become the trend in ship collision avoidance field szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 fuzzy mathematics hasegawa et al 1989 has been applied in the fuzzy classification and reasoning of ship collision risk for a long time in aspect of fuzzy classification the appropriate membership function is a key issue in hasegawa et al 1989 the triangular and trapezoidal membership functions are proposed to represent different fuzzy variables of collision avoidance parameters in further researches hara and hammer 1993 the subjective feelings of the crew are also considered in fuzzy classification in aspect of fuzzy reasoning perera et al 2011 uses fuzzy maximum first fmf for reasoning and several representative achievements are achieved perera et al 2014 2012 in park et al 2007 a case based reasoning cbr fuzzy mathematical method is also used for collision avoidance and obtained reliable results park and kim 2011 park et al 2007 generally the output of fuzzy mathematics relies on the membership functions set in advance which needs more prior knowledge besides neural networks inaishi and matsumura 1992 is another powerful approach which has the ability to model the uncertain factors in reasoning the ship collision risk generally the neural networks is commonly combined with fuzzy mathematics ahn et al 2012 and expert system es simsir et al 2014 to realize the collision avoidance with the development of computer science swarm intelligence and machine learning methods have become hot topics in ship collision avoidance ant colony optimization aco lazarowska 2014 2015 tsou and hsueh 2010 and particle swarm optimization pso ma et al 2018 naeem et al 2016 chen and huang 2012 liu et al 2017 are the most commonly used swarm intelligence algorithms in ship collision avoidance which can obtain good results with an appropriate fitness function including the collision risk similar to swarm intelligence the model free reinforcement learning methods cheng and zhang 2018 kim et al 2019 shen et al 2019 also attract much attention in ship collision avoidance recently however the relative high computation of swarm intelligence and reinforcement learning methods have become the main barriers in the practical applications in ship collision avoidance generally speaking intelligent optimization methods establish the collision risk model and use a series of optimization algorithms to achieve collision avoidance benefiting from the consideration of the ship collision risk index cri and international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs cockroft and lameijer 2004 most intelligent optimization methods can obtain reasonable collision avoidance results in typical encounter scenarios under the premise of real time ability 1 2 related works of mpc for ship collision avoidance for underactuated surface vessels accurate tracking of the planned path harris et al 1999 is also necessary in a reasonable collision avoidance system if the system does not fully consider the constraints and maneuverability of the ship motion or the real time performance cannot meet the control requirements tran et al 2002 the effect of collision avoidance will become worse which may lead to a large difference between the actual results and the expectation at present it is still difficult to realize effective automatic collision avoidance in consideration of constraints ship s maneuvering characteristics and colregs as an effective method to deal with the control constraints model predictive control mpc method has the characteristics of rolling prediction and on line optimization zheng et al 2014 which is more suitable for real ship control with large inertia and hysteresis zhang et al 2017 in the field of collision avoidance distributed model predictive control dmpc method zheng et al 2017 negenborn and maestre 2014 has already been used in multi agent cooperative collision avoidance to solve the problem of motion conflict between multi autonomous individuals zheng et al 2017 has proposed a novel cost effective robust distributed control approach for waterborne autonomous guided vessels agvs which models the price of robustness by explicitly considering uncertainty and system characteristics in a tube based robust control framework dai et al 2017 has also applied dmpc to multi uav motion planning and the virtual state trajectory with compatibility constraints is used to guide the multi uav motion planning instead of the real trajectory which guarantees the stability of the whole system in perizzato et al 2015 dmpc is introduced into the collision avoidance of multi autonomous ground robots and the path planning of multi robot is realized with external and internal collision avoidance constraints in the aspect of ship collision avoidance scholars mainly regard the ship domain model as a constraint condition of mpc to solve the collision avoidance problem abdelaal et al 2016 have proposed a path tracking and collision avoidance method based on nonlinear mpc nmpc with elliptical ship domain and applied the method to a 3 dof ship model after that a disturbance observer is introduced in the controller to realize the effective control and collision avoidance under uncertain disturbances abdelaal et al 2018 1 3 related works of bas algorithm stochastic optimization algorithms such as grey wolf optimization algorithm gwo yao et al 2016 ant colony optimization aco algorithm bououden et al 2015 particle swarm optimization pso algorithm chen et al 2018 wang et al 2018b etc are widely used in complex optimization tasks e g the dynamic programming in mpc among them the pso algorithm is most commonly used in various optimization problems due to its simple structure and fast convergence as a novel stochastic optimization algorithm similar to pso beetle antenna search bas algorithm is proposed in 2017 jiang and li 2018 which has a more concise search strategy based on the foraging behavior of beetles the effectivenesses of bas based algorithms have been validated in various optimization problems wang et al 2018a sun et al 2019 lin et al 2018 lin and li 2018 lin et al 2018 use the bas algorithm to solve the pid fine tuning problem of the double closed loop dc motor speed regulator sun et al 2019 propose a bas based fine tuning method for the back propagation neural network bpnn wu et al 2019 propose a novel fall back bas algorithm for collision free path planning due to the concise search strategy bas based algorithms are considered to have great potential in solving optimization problems in mpc 1 4 contributions and outlines although rich achievements have been obtained there still exists several main drawbacks in existing ship collision avoidance methods 1 most of the path generation methods take fewer considerations of the ship maneuverability which may lead to a large gap between the actual collision avoidance results and the expectation 2 existing real time optimization based methods usually use static maneuvering characteristics e g the turning radius and maximum heading change to set constraints and realize real time collision avoidance by a delayed feedback which cannot foresee the potential collisions 3 the premature and local optimum problems in optimization algorithms e g the pso and bas also affects the collision avoidance results in addition the widely used ship hydrodynamic model has plenty of parameters which also has influences on the real time performance of collision avoidance in this study a simplified 3 degree of freedom 3 dof ship model is established and a predictive collision avoidance method is proposed based on mpc and an improved bas algorithm the main contributions of this study are briefly summarized as follows 1 a simplified 3 dof ship model is proposed by ignoring higher order terms of the abkowitz model for collision avoidance which reduces the complexity for prediction and optimization 2 a predictive collision avoidance strategy derived from mpc is proposed to give full considerations of ship maneuverability and real time ability which can predict potential collision risks and obtain feedback from the environment simultaneously 3 in order to solve the nonlinear optimization problem in mpc better the original bas algorithm is improved in this study based on antenna performances to defect the local optimum problem the remainder of this article is organized as follows in section 2 a simplified 3 dof motion model based on abkowitz model is proposed in section 3 a predictive collision avoidance strategy based on the simplified model colregs and predictive control method is designed in section 4 an improved bas algorithm is proposed and the convergence of the proposed method is analyzed theoretically in section 5 ship collision avoidance experiments under typical encounter scenarios are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparisons with the original bas algorithm in section 7 conclusions and further research are presented 2 simplified 3 dof ship dynamic model the 3 dof motion coordinate system of a underactuated surface vessel is shown in fig 1 here o o x o y o is the inertial coordinate system of the vessel o x y is the co rotational coordinate system of the vessel u v and r are the velocities in surge body fixed x sway body fixed y and yaw directions respectively δ and ψ are the rudder and heading angle of the vessel respectively β is the drift angle then the 3 dof hydrodynamic model can be obtained as shown in eq 1 1 m u v r x g r 2 x m v u r x g r 2 y i z r m x g v u r n where m is the total mass of the vessel x g is the longitudinal coordinate of the gravity center of the vessel in surge direction i z is the moment of the inertia x y and n are the hydrodynamics of the vessel in 3 dof directions respectively 2 1 abkowitz hydrodynamic model abkowitz model is obtained by mechanical analysis of the ship as a whole object including rudder and propeller zhang and zou 2011 the hydrodynamics on the right side of eq 1 are expanded as shown in eq 2 2 m x u u f 1 u v r δ m y v v m x g y r r f 2 u v r δ m x g n v v i z z n r r f 3 u v r δ where f 1 f 2 and f 3 are the integrations of the coupling multiplication the square terms of u v r and δ and the lift drag terms furthermore this model can be organized into a state space form 3 u f x δ u δ v δ r δ δ v f y δ u δ v δ r δ δ r f n δ u δ v δ r δ δ where δ u δ v δ r and δ δ are the changes of the state variable u v r and δ f x f y and f n are the high order polynomials of the state 2 2 simplified hydrodynamic model based on the real time requirement of ship collision avoidance the parameters in the original abkowitz model need to be simplified under the premise of guaranteeing the accuracy of the model and the assumption that the hull is left right symmetrical some higher order terms in the right of eq 3 can be ignored 1 surge direction the main force in the surge direction of a ship is the propeller s thrust which is directly proportional to the square of the propeller s speed so x 0 x n n n 2 is used to represent the propulsion force and the rest terms unrelated to δ u are kept to 2nd order 4 f x

underactuated ship is sailing directly under a constant speed δ v δ r 0 and the rudder angle δ δ δ 0 the force is balanced in the sway direction where δ 0 is the needed rudder angle to keep the heading directly so the changes of δ u δ v δ r or δ δ will make contributions to the force in sway direction considering that the changes of δ u and δ δ have greater influences on the force in sway direction terms which are only related to δ v and δ r are kept to 1st order and terms which are related to δ u and δ δ are kept to 3rd order 5 f y y u u δ u 2 y v δ v u 0 y r δ r u 0 y δ δ δ u 0 2 y δ

is similar to the parameters in sway direction 6 f n n u u δ u 2 n v δ v u 0 n r δ r u 0 n δ δ δ u 0 2 n δ δ δ δ δ 3 u 0 2 n v v δ δ v 2 δ δ n v δ δ δ v δ δ 2 u 0 n δ u δ δ δ u u 0 n v u δ v δ u n r u

δ δ δ u 2 11 1 t where x y and n are the redefined states then the motion model in eq 3 can be rewritten as 8 u v r a x 0 0 0 a y 0 0 0 a n x y n where a x a y and a n are the coefficient matrices to be identified in addition the relationship model between x y ψ and u v r is shown in eq 9 9 x y ψ sin ψ cos ψ 0 cos ψ sin ψ 0 0 0 1 u v r then the following simplified 3 dof state model can be obtained by combining eqs 8 and 9 10 x s f x s x s u v r x y ψ t f x s θ x y n d x d y d ψ t θ d i a g a x a y a n 1 1 1 d x u sin ψ v cos ψ d y u cos ψ v cos ψ d ψ r where f is the derivation function of the lumped state x s after the parameter matrix θ in eq 10 is identified completely the final 3 dof model can be used for ship state prediction 3 collision avoidance based on predictive control the proposed simplified model in eq 10 is used to predict the future states of the ship motion then the ship collision risks in different encounter scenarios in finite time horizon are calculated based on the predicted states of the own ship and the target ship finally both the safety factor collision risk and the economic factor control changes are considered comprehensively to form the optimization problem of collision avoidance 3 1 model discretization and risk prediction in view of that the computer can only process discrete data it is necessary to discrete the continuous state model in eq 10 to minimize the loss of model accuracy the widely used runge kutta wambecq 1978 method is adopted in the discretization for the own ship the following step by step prediction equations can be obtained based on runge kutta 11 x s t 1 f s x s t f s x s t x s t h 6 k 1 2 k 2 2 k 3 k 4 k 1 f x s t k 2 f x s t h 2 k 1 k 3 f x s t h 2 k 2 k 4 f x s t h k 3 where f s is the discretization form of the derivation function f h is the discretization step k 1 k 4 are the derivation function values of f at different moments in one step in this paper we focus on the situation that the own ship is the give way ship and the target ship is the stand on ship which has no sway velocity v and yaw velocity r therefore the lumped state of target ship is 12 x t u t 0 0 x t y t ψ t t where u t is the surge velocity of the target ship x t and y t are the inertial coordinates of the target ship ψ t is the heading of the target ship then the derivation function of x t is simplified as 13 f x t u t 0 0 u t sin ψ t u t cos ψ t 0 t based on eq 13 the discretization state model of the target ship can be obtained by replacing x s and the function f in eq 11 with x t and f respectively 14 x t t 1 f t x t t where f t is the discretization form of f after the discretization of the own ship and the target ship the encounter parameters i e relative position body fixed θ t real relative position α t relative velocity v r and the direction of the relative velocity ψ r can be calculated by geometric method as shown in fig 2 furthermore the distance at closest point of approach dcpa and the time to closest point of approach tcpa are calculated as shown in eq 15 15 d c p a r t sin ψ r α t π t c p a r t cos ψ r α t π v r then the collision risk between two ships at time t can be obtained based on fuzzy mathematic method 16 f c r i t λ d c p a λ t c p a λ r t λ θ t λ k u d c p a t u t c p a t u r t t u θ t t u k t t where f c r i is the collision risk u d c p a t u t c p a t u r t t u θ t t and u k t are the membership functions of d c p a t c p a r t θ t and the ship speed ratio k at time t which are calculated based on the widely used ship risk model in zheng and wu 2002 λ d c p a λ t c p a λ r t λ θ t and λ k are the set weights of the membership functions which are usually set as 0 400 0 367 0 133 0 067 and 0 033 respectively in addition a negative tcpa indicates that the two ships have passed each other and the collision risk f c r i should be close to zero therefore an additional condition is set to eliminating the impacts of residual dcpa and tcpa 17 λ d c p a λ t c p a 0 i f tcpa 0 assuming that the implicit function between the collision risk and the ship states is f c r i t γ x s t x t t which can be obtained by eqs 11 16 the prediction equation of the collision risk in a prediction horizon is 18 f c r i t f c r i t 1 f c r i t 2 f c r i t n p t γ f s x s t f t x t t γ f s f s x s t f t f t x t t γ f s f s n p x s t f t f t n p x t t where n p is the prediction horizon f c r i t is the final prediction collision risk at time t 3 2 constraint condition according to the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs cockroft and lameijer 2004 the encounter scenarios can be divided to three typical categories i e head on crossing and overtaking based on the relative position of the target ship as shown in fig 3 the colregs stipulate that the own ship is the give way ship and has the duty of steering to avoid collision in head on and starboard crossing encounter scenarios otherwise the own ship is the stand on ship and should keep its course and speed when the own ship is the give way ship it is recommended to turn right in head on rule 14 and starboard crossing scenarios rule 15 in addition the own ship is also recommended as the give way ship when the own ship wants to overtake other ships rule 13 based on the above advices the following constraint conditions for rudder angle are set in different relative position θ t 19 0 δ δ max i f 355 θ t 360 0 θ t 112 5 δ max δ δ max i f 112 5 θ t 355 where δ max is the maximum angle of the rudder actuator then the constraint conditions can ensure that the collision avoidance decisions conform to the rules as far as possible under different encounter scenarios in addition the actuator of a real ship also has constraints in maximum rudder angle speed the following condition is set on the rudder angle changes 20 δ δ t δ δ max δ δ t δ t δ t 1 δ δ max h δ max where δ t is the rudder angle at time t h is the control period δ max is the maximum rudder angle speed 3 3 optimization problem reasonable objective function is very important in the application of model predictive control to ship collision avoidance generally both the safety cost and economic cost are considered in existing researches in this study the actual rudder angle is chosen as the control variable to be optimized the target is to minimize the predictive collision risks f t and the rudder changes 21 j p δ p μ 1 f t μ 2 f δ δ p t f δ δ t δ δ p t 1 δ δ p t n p δ δ p i 1 δ p i 1 δ p i i 1 n p where μ 1 and μ 2 are the weights of the safety cost and economic cost respectively represents for 2 norms function f δ δ p is the cost for rudder changes δ p is the predictive input sequence in prediction horizon n p therefore the collision avoidance method based on predictive control can be described as the following optimization problem 22 arg min δ p j p δ p s t eqs 11 14 18 19 20 after solving the above optimization problem at time t the first value of the input sequence δ p is taken as the actual rudder angle i e δ t 1 δ p t 1 which is used for motion control in the control horizon n c generally in order to reflect the prediction effect n c n p is adopted 3 4 re sailing and stand on since the collision states e g the dcpa tcpa etc will change during the voyage the ship is considered to be re sailed back to the route if there is no collision risk moreover the give way ship may change to a stand on ship after collision avoidance measures are taken which requires a stable course angle and speed based on colregs in order to solve the course keeping and re sailing problem at the same time the widely used line of sight los guidance strategy liu et al 2018 is adopted in this study to transform the re sailing problem to a course keeping problem then a pid controller is used to keep the course of the ship assuming that the pid inputs for re sailing and stand on scenarios are δ r e and δ s t respectively the final input for the entire voyage of the ship is determined by the following switching strategy 23 i f f c r i t f c r i min t c p a 0 δ t δ r e t e l s e i f 112 5 θ t 355 δ t δ s t t e l s e δ t δ p t where f c r i min is a set minimum threshold for the collision risk f c r i δ p t is the calculated input result of mpc in section 3 3 4 improved bas algorithm for collision avoidance at present swarm intelligence and evolution algorithms i e genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso and ant colony search algorithm aco have been applied in nonlinear optimization problems successfully however the essence of this kind of stochastic optimization methods represented by pso is using a certain population of species to share the optimal value according to some strategy when the population size is large the prediction process in eq 18 in each iteration consumes a large amount of time which is disadvantaged to rapidly solving of collision avoidance problem the beetle antennae search bas algorithm is a highly efficient optimization algorithm proposed in 2017 compared with the pso search algorithm only one individual is needed in bas i e a beetle which has the characteristics of small calculation fast convergence and strong global optimization ability 4 1 original bas algorithm from eq 22 it can be seen that the parameters to be optimized are the control sequence δ p δ p 1 δ p 2 δ p n p and the search dimension is the prediction horizon n p then the steps of the original bas algorithm are summarized as follows step 1 define two n p dimensional vectors x l and x r as the left and the right antenna of the beetle respectively then use x and d s represents the centroid of the beetle and the distance between the antennae respectively after the initial values of δ p are assigned to the centroid x calculate the initial cost value and regard it as the current minimum cost j p min step 2 assuming that the direction of the beetle antennae is random which can be represented by a random vector dir r a n d n p 1 from the right antenna to the left antenna then calculate the two antennae with the normalization of dir is d dir n o r m dir as 24 x l x d s d 2 x r x d s d 2 where d s can be also regarded as the exploring step of two antennae then choose x l or x r crosswise based on eq 24 for multi step control simulation in prediction horizon and collect the motion data of the ships to calculate the objective function values j p x x l and j p x x r by eq 21 step 3 if j p x x l j p x x r then make the beetle run a fixed distance l s t e p k d s toward the left direction that is x x l s t e p d if j p x x l j p x x r then make the beetle run a fixed distance l s t e p k d s toward the right direction that is x x l s t e p d then the unified equation using symbolic function s g n is 25 x x s g n j p x x r j p x x l l s t e p d step 4 when the centroid of the beetle x is updated choose it for control simulation and recalculate the cost j p x at the same time then compare j p x with the current minimum cost j p b e s t to update the optimal parameters x b e s t and the minimum cost function value j p b e s t by greedy strategy 26 j p b e s t j p x x b e s t x i f f b a s x j p b e s t at this point one search iteration of bas is completed execute step 2 4 circularly until the end of the iterations or the time when the minimum cost meets the requirement step 5 adopt the first value of x b e s t as the rudder input to control the own ship in control horizon i e δ t x b e s t 1 and repeat step 1 5 until the end of the collision avoidance in addition fig 4 shows the flow chart of the bas algorithm for better illustration a simplified beetle in 2 dof is used to visualize the search process and the geometric distance in 2 dof space is regarded as the fitness function as can be seen from fig 4 the beetle becomes closer to the theoretical optimum after exploring in an iteration and the left flow shows the details of the bas algorithm 4 2 improved bas algorithm for constrained problem although the original bas algorithm is more concise in search strategy and requires less calculation cost than pso it is still a stochastic optimization method without changing the optimization object when the calculation cost of the model prediction increases the real time performance of the search algorithm will be reduced therefore more reasonable initialization and the update strategy of the parameters can improve the search efficiency to a certain extent 4 2 1 searching strategy improvement it can be seen from eq 24 that the left and right antennae of the beetle are always searched from both sides of the centroid x which cannot make full use of the historical trajectories of the two antennae in the search process even if the step size l s t e p changes the locations of the two antennae are always constrained by the position of the current centroid x which is easy to fall into local extremum in case of only one individual therefore the local optimal positions of two antennae and the corresponding optimal objective function values are introduced to improve the search strategy using the update strategy of pso for references eq 24 is modified as 27 x l x l b e s t d s d 2 x r x r b e s t d s d 2 where x l b e s t and x r b e s t are the historical optimal parameters of the left antenna and right antenna respectively after the two antennae have been searched based on eq 27 the x l b e s t and x r b e s t are updated as 28 j p l b e s t j p x x l x l b e s t x l i f j p x x l j p l b e s t j p r b e s t j p x x r x r b e s t x r i f j p x x r j p r b e s t where j p l b e s t and j p r b e s t are the historical optimal objective function values of the left and right antennae respectively referring to the strategy of particle velocity updating in pso x l b e s t and x r b e s t are used to correct the centroid position x in each iteration as 29 x x s g n j p x x r j p x x l l s t e p d c l r d x l b e s t x c r r d x r b e s t x where r d 0 1 is a random value c l and c r are the defined learning factors of the left antenna and right antenna respectively in general c l and c r should be determined by the historical optimal cost j p l b e s t and j p r b e s t in the search process if j p l b e s t is smaller than j p r b e s t it is considered that the current optimal position of the left antenna is closer to the global optimal position then c l c r should be satisfied and vice versa therefore the following c l and c r are selected 30 c l λ j p r b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t c r λ j p l b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t where represents the 2 norms function 0 λ 1 is the set positive constant which is similar to the weight of particle velocity in pso 4 2 2 parameters initialization in the improved strategy the centroid x is no longer restricted to the two antennae which is also affected by the introduced local optimal values x l b e s t and x r b e s t then the initialization of x l b e s t and x r b e s t should be more reliable at present most of the stochastic search algorithms use a set of random values in the search space as the initial parameters without prior knowledge nevertheless for the optimization problem in eq 22 the parameters to be optimized are the sequence of ship rudder angles in the predicted horizon which have strong continuities in a limited horizon restricted by the constrains and large inertia of the ship and the actual actuator therefore the optimal values should be changed continuously and the initial values of x l b e s t and x r b e s t can be set to the fixed values according to the constrains of rudder angle without losing generality the original problem is simplified to a 1 dof space search problem for parameter initialization analyze the learning term produced by the introduced x l b e s t and x r b e s t in eq 29 is 31 δ x c l r d x l b e s t x c r r d x r b e s t x λ r d j p r b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t x l b e s t j p l b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t x r b e s t x where δ x represents the learning term then a learning object x l r can be defined as 32 x l r j p r b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t x l b e s t j p l b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t x r b e s t from eq 32 it can be seen that the improved beetle runs a further distance to the position of x l r in each iteration compared with original bas assuming that the theoretical optimal position is x b e s t the maximum distance between x l r and x b e s t should be as small as possible generally the initial values of x l b e s t and x r b e s t have two relative positions as shown in fig 5 1 when both x l b e s t and x r b e s t are on the same side of x b e s t the upper limit of the distance between initial x and x r b e s t is determined by the constraint area of the side on which x l b e s t and x r b e s t are located assuming that the constraint of x is x x min x max then the maximum distance between x l r and x b e s t occurs when x l b e s t x r b e s t x min or x l b e s t x r b e s t x max 33 d 1 max x b e s t x min x max x b e s t where d 1 is the maximum distance between x l r and x b e s t if both x l b e s t and x r b e s t are on the same side of x b e s t 2 when x l b e s t and x r b e s t are on the opposite sides of x b e s t the maximum distance d 2 between x l r and x b e s t occurs when x l b e s t x min x r b e s t x b e s t or x l b e s t x b e s t x r b e s t x max 34 d 2 max x b e s t a r x min 1 a r x b e s t x max a r x b e s t 1 a r x max max a r x b e s t x min 1 a r x max x b e s t max x b e s t x min x max x b e s t d 1 a r j p r b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t where d 2 is the maximum distance between x l r and x b e s t if x l b e s t and x r b e s t are on the opposite sides of x b e s t based on eq 34 x l b e s t x min and x r b e s t x max are set for initialization to make sure that the x l b e s t and x r b e s t are located on the opposite sides of x b e s t respectively furthermore the following initial values of x l b e s t and x r b e s t are set combined with eq 19 35 x l b e s t i i 1 2 n p δ max x r b e s t i i 1 2 n p δ max i f 112 5 θ t 355 x l b e s t i i 1 2

needs to be analyzed stability analysis based on linear time invariant discrete systems is a common method for this kind of stochastic search algorithm in this section the range of learning factor λ introduced in the improved bas algorithm is analyzed based on this method firstly combining eqs 29 and 30 we get 36 x x s g n j p x x r j p x x l l s t e p d λ j p r b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t r d x l b e s t x λ j p l b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t r d x r b e s t x for the convenience of analysis the direction d in eq 27 and fitness function values j p r b e s t and j p r b e s t are regarded as discrete variables without loss of generality make 37 φ 1 t j p r b e s t j p l b e s t j p r b e s t φ 2 t s g n j p x x r j p x x l d then the discrete form of eq 37 is 38 x t 1 x t l s t e p t 1 φ 2 t λ φ 1 t r d x l b e s t x λ 1 φ 1 t r d x r b e s t x 1 λ φ 1 t r d 1 φ 1 t r d x t l s t e p t 1 φ 2 t λ φ 1 t r d x l b e s t λ 1 φ 1 t r d x r b e s t to simplify the calculation the random values r d behind the two learning factors are set the same then eq 38 is simplified to 39 x t 1 1 λ x t l s t e p t 1 φ 2 t φ 3 t φ 3 t λ φ 1 t r d x l b e s t λ 1 φ 1 t r d x r b e s t generally the attenuation strategy is widely applied for the step l s t e p in bas 40 τ s t e p t 1 α τ s t e p t l s t e p t τ s t e p t l 0 where α is the attenuation coefficient of l s t e p l 0 is the set minimum step combining eqs 39 and 40 we can get a linear discrete equation 41 z t 1 a t z t b t z t x t τ s t e p t t a t 1 λ α φ 2 t 0 α b t l 0 φ 2 t φ 3 t 0 t assuming that φ φ 1 t φ 2 t φ 3 t is a constant matrix eq 41 is a typical linear time invariant discrete system the necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of the system in eq 41 is that the two eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix a t satisfy the following conditions 42 1 λ 1 α 1 0 λ 2 1 α 1 therefore the following theorem can be summarized theorem 1 the necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of the improved bas algorithm is 0 λ 2 a n d 1 α 1 finally the proposed ship predictive collision avoidance algorithm based on the improved bas is denoted in algorithm 1 4 4 validation on benchmark functions to verify the optimization performance of the improved bas algorithm several benchmark functions are used for optimization tests as shown in table 1 using the original bas algorithm and the widely used linear decreasing weight pso ldwpso algorithm as comparisons considering the real time requirement of on line optimization i e the proposed predictive collision avoidance problem it is necessary to compare both the performance under the same calculation amount and the required calculation amount to achieve the same performance 4 4 1 performance comparisons under the same calculation amount since the original bas and the improved bas algorithm calculate the objective function value three times per iteration left antenna right antenna and centroid the population size of ldwpso is set to 3 the remaining parameters of the algorithms are set as table 2 in view of the uncertainty of stochastic search algorithm 50 groups of repeated experiments are taken for each benchmark and the final optimal function values and convergence times are recorded as shown in figs 6 and 7 the mean values and standard deviations std are further calculated as indicators as shown in table 3 it can be seen from figs 6 7 and table 3 that 1 in terms of the final optimization results both the mean and std of the optimal values of the original bas and ldwpso are at the same level while those of the improved bas are smaller in all benchmarks which indicates that the improved bas algorithm has better performance in the average ability and stability of optimization 2 in terms of the convergence times mean convergence time of the improved bas algorithm are shorter than those of the original bas and ldwpso in all benchmarks which indicated that the average convergence speed of the improved bas algorithm is faster for relative simpler functions i e f 4 f 3 the improved bas algorithm can converge to the optimal value in less than 10 iterations besides the std of the convergence time of the improved bas algorithm are also shorter than those of the original bas and ldwpso in most of the functions except the relative complex function f 1 which shows the advantage of the improved bas algorithm in convergence speed to illustrate the optimization process more intuitively descent curves of fitness and parameter optimization process in a single test are shown in figs 8 and 9 4 4 2 computation comparisons with the same performance since the improved bas and original bas algorithms have the same calculation amount repeated experiments are conducted on the improved bas and ldwpso with population size n 3 6 9 and 12 respectively the mean values of the final optimal results and convergence time are recorded as shown in figs 10 and 11 and the descent curves of the function values in one of the tests are shown in fig 12 the abscissas of each subgraph in figs 10 and 11 are the population sizes of ldwpso it can be seen that both the mean optimal values and the convergence time of ldwpso are gradually reduced with the increase of the population size of ldwpso while the optimal fitness values and the convergence time of the proposed improved bas are still smaller and shorter than those of ldwpso respectively until the population size of ldwpso reaches 12 at this time the computational complexities of ldwpso and improved bas are theoretically o 12 and o 3 and the actual average time cost of ldwpso and improved bas in a single iteration are about 0 31 s and 0 09 s respectively which further indicates that the improved bas could achieve the same optimization performance as ldwpso with less calculation cost 5 simulation experiments simulation experiments are carried out in two aspects 1 maneuverability predictions of zig zag tests and turning test are carried out based on the widely used kvlcc2 ship model and the proposed simplified 3 dof hydrodynamic model for accuracy verification 2 typical encounter scenarios head on crossing over taking etc are set up and the collision avoidance simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed predictive collision avoidance method based on the improved bas 5 1 simplified 3 dof model verification taking the 20 20 zig zag test data of kvlcc2 model as training samples the parameters of the simplified 3 dof model are identified by the widely used least squares support vector machine ls svm as shown in table 4 then the maneuverability predictions of 10 10 20 20 30 30 zig zag tests and 35 left turning test are conducted based on the identified model with parameters in table 4 the comparisons of the prediction results and the actual state of the validation samples i e u v r x y ψ are shown in figs 13 16 and the root mean square errors rsme of the predictions are further calculated as shown in table 5 1 it can be seen from the curves in figs 13 16 that the simplified 3 dof model with the training samples of 20 20 zigzag test can accurately predict the zig zag and turning test data under other rudder angles i e 10 10 and 30 30 2 the results in table 5 show that the simplified model has low precision loss and strong generalization in addition the rmses of each state variable in 10 10 and 30 30 zig zag tests are slightly higher than those in 20 20 zig zag test which indicates that the changes of the maneuverability under different rudder angles has a certain influence on the accuracy of the identified hydrodynamic coefficients this result can be accepted since the proposed simplified model is an abkowitz based model generally speaking the accuracy of the proposed 3 dof simplified model is verified by the small prediction error moreover the prediction error of the ship position can reach under 1 4 of the ship length l p p which basically meets the precision requirements of predictive collision avoidance in a finite time horizon 5 2 collision avoidance experiments the kvlcc2 ship model is used to calculate the ship s real motion state in the simulation experiment and the simplified 3 dof model is used to predict the ship s state in the predictive horizon the control horizon and predictive horizon are set as 1 s and 3 s respectively since the weight of objective function in eq 22 also affects the final collision avoidance effect μ 1 0 9 and μ 2 0 1 are set in the experiments to take more safety cost into account and observe the collision avoidance effect easily in order to form reasonable typical ship encounter scenarios the initial states of the target ship are set based on eq 43 to ensure collisions with the own ship if no measures are taken 43 x t 0 x 0 r sin ψ 0 k r sin ψ 0 θ y t 0 y 0 r cos ψ 0 k r cos ψ 0 θ ψ t 0 ψ 0 θ π u t 0 k u 0 k u v t 0 v 0 0 r t 0 r 0 0 where x 0 y 0 ψ 0 u 0 v 0 r 0 are the initial states of the own ship x t 0 y t 0 ψ t 0 u t 0 v t 0 r t 0 are the initial states of the target ship u is the service speed of the own ship and k is the speed ratio r is the set distance before the collision and θ is the set relative position angle of the target ship by setting different k and θ the target ship will collide with the own ship if no avoidance measures are taken since the scale of the kvlcc2 model ship is 1 45 the distance r is set as r 6 nm 45 287 m in head on and crossing encounters and r 8 nm 45 330 m in overtaking encounter other parameters are set in table 6 for comprehensive verification two crossing encounter scenarios with different position angles are set in this study throughout this section the os and ts in each figure represent the own ship and target ship respectively the cp represents the closest positions of two ships during the collision avoidance besides the minimum collision risk threshold for re sailing is set as f c r i min 0 05 5 2 1 scenario 1 head on the trajectories of the own ship and the target ship in head on encounter are recorded as shown in fig 17 and the real time collision avoidance parameters i e dcpa tcpa actual rudder angle and collision risk are recorded as shown in fig 18 for easy analysis the minimum relative distance mean and maximum of dcpa mean and maximum of collision risk index cri i e f c r i are further calculated as the indicators in table 7 the closest positions cp of the own ship os and the target ship ts are marked with different shapes in the original and the partial enlarged graph in fig 17 it can be seen from the results in table 7 that the minimum distance mean and maximum dcpa of the improved bas based algorithm are obviously larger than those of the original bas furthermore the mean and maximum cri of the improved bas are also smaller than bas which indicates that the improved bas obtains better collision avoidance results than the original bas in addition the initial rudder inputs of the own ship based on the improved bas are more responsive to the potential collision as shown in fig 18 which results in larger dcpa and smaller cri after taking the avoidance measures 5 2 2 scenario 2 crossing both small angle and large angle crossing encounter scenarios on starboard are considered in this section according to fig 3 and 10 and 80 crossing angles are set as in table 6 the trajectories of the two ships in small angle crossing and large angle crossing encounters are shown in figs 19 and 21 respectively the real time collision avoidance parameters in small angle crossing and large angle crossing encounters are recorded as shown in figs 20 and 22 respectively the evaluation indicators of collision avoidance are further calculated in table 8 it can be seen that 1 in aspect of small angle crossing encounter the mean and max cri of the improved bas algorithm 0 034 and 0 487 respectively are both smaller than those of the original bas 0 111 and 0 603 respectively however the initial optimal results of the improved bas are close to the full rudder which results in a larger steering angle and increases the time required for re sailing as shown in the actual trajectories in fig 19 and the rudder changes in fig 20 in addition it can be seen from table 8 that the steering time for collision avoidance is longer in starboard crossing encounter than that in head on encounter which will result in larger dcpa and smaller cri the reason for this phenomenon is that the own ship cannot be relieved of the obligation of collision avoidance until the target ship has moved into the port area under the limitation of colregs which takes more time in starboard crossing encounter 2 in aspect of large angle crossing encounter the simulation results in large angle crossing encounter are very similar to those in small angle crossing encounter the improved bas can obviously obtain larger minimum distance mean and maximum dcpa 189 m 222 m and 269 m respectively than the original bas 73 m 102 m and 151 m respectively in addition as can be seen from the changes of rudder angle and cri in fig 22 that the improved bas adopts a starboard steering much earlier than the original bas which reduces the cri in time with a slight acceleration of the decreasing of tcpa from the trajectories in fig 21 it can be also seen that the trajectory obtained by the improved bas also turns much earlier than that of the original bas which is more obvious than that in small angle crossing encounter therefore the improved bas algorithm can avoid collisions by passing through the stern of the target ship in time and obtains safer avoidance results than the original bas in both small and large angle starboard crossing encounters 5 2 3 scenario 3 overtaking the trajectories of the own ship and the target ship under over taking encounter are shown in fig 23 the collision avoidance parameters are shown in fig 24 and the evaluation indicators are further calculated in table 9 theoretically the evaluate indicators of collision avoidance in overtaking encounter should be similar to those in head on encounter because of the similarity of the relative position between the two ships in overtaking and head on encounters which can be verified by the results from tables 7 and 9 in addition it can be seen from the collision risk curves in fig 24 that the decreasing speed of the cri in over taking encounter is slower than that in the head on encounter since the own ship re sailings to the same course as the target ship after collision avoidance in spite of this the cri is also close to zero in the end of the simulation which indicates the effectiveness of collision avoidance in the over taking encounter 5 2 4 scenario 4 multi ship encounter considering the limitation of colregs and ship maneuverability most of the current researches on multi ship collision avoidance in open waters determine the avoidance order of different target ships by avoiding the current key ship i e the most dangerous ship so as to decompose the multi ship encounters into continuous encounters in this section continuous encounters head on and crossing are set to verify the continuous avoidance ability of the proposed method since the initialization method in typical encounters is not suitable for multi ship encounters the initial states of two target ships are set as shown in table 10 the trajectories of the own ship and the target ships are shown in fig 25 the collision avoidance parameters are shown in fig 26 and the evaluation indicators are further calculated in table 11 it can be seen from the trajectory curves in fig 25 and the data in table 11 that the collision avoidance results between target ship 1 and 2 of the improved bas are effective i e avoiding the two target ships successfully with continuous starboard steering actions while the original bas obtains smaller minimum distance 14 m than the improved bas 33 m with target ship 1 and even fails to avoid target ship 2 moreover as can be seen from fig 26 that the improved bas obtains positive dcpa results with target ship 2 very quickly by continuous starboard steering and the own ship passes through the stern of the target ship 2 effectively which is conformity with the colregs while the original bas does not take the steering actions in time resulting in non positive dcpa results with target ship 2 until the collision happens which indicates the effectiveness of the improvement on the bas algorithm overall from the indicators in table 11 the improved bas obtains larger dcpa and smaller cri results than the original bas e g the mean dcpa and cri with target ship 2 of the improved bas are 114 983 m and 0 080 while those of the original bas are 30 446 m and 0 236 which are similar to the results in typical encounters therefore it can be concluded that the proposed improved bas method also outperforms the original bas in the setting multi ship encounter 6 summary in summary a simplified 3 dof ship dynamic model is introduced and a predictive collision avoidance method is proposed based on model predictive control and an improved beetle antenna search bas algorithm the ship dynamic model is simplified by ignoring several higher order terms in the taylor extensions of the force and moment in abkowitz model then a predictive collision avoidance strategy is proposed by applying the model predictive control method with the simplified ship model and collision risk model in order to solve the optimization problem in the predictive strategy an improved bas algorithm is proposed by improving the searching strategy of the original bas with historical antenna optimums the convergence of the improved bas is analyzed theoretically and the general optimization ability of the improved bas are also verified based on several benchmarks finally the effectiveness of the simplified ship model and the proposed improved bas based predictive collision avoidance method are verified in simulations based on the widely used kvlcc2 ship model 7 conclusions and future works the main works of this paper are concluded as follows 1 with respect to the simplified ship dynamic model the zigzag tests and turning tests results show that the predictions of the proposed simplified 3 dof model are accurate compared with the complete model which indicates the effectiveness of the simplified model 2 with respect to the proposed improved bas algorithm the results in benchmark function tests and ship collision avoidance tests show that the improved bas algorithm outperforms the original bas in both numeral optimization and the predictive ship collision avoidance which indicates the effectiveness of the improvements on bas 3 with respect to the proposed predictive collision avoidance strategy experiment results show that the proposed strategy can realize effective ship collision avoidance in both typical ship encounters and a multi ship encounter which indicates the effectiveness of the predictive strategy with the improved bas algorithm the future works will focus on the following aspects 1 in this study the ship s speed is given by the service speed and the simplified model is also established under the service speed when the speed changes greatly the ship maneuverability will change accordingly therefore a sensitivity analysis of the simplified model parameters under different speeds will be considered in future research to extract the parameters which are sensitive to the speed changes then a possible regression analysis of the important parameters will be carried out on the basis of the sensitivity analysis results 2 since the prediction horizon of the predictive strategy also affects the collision avoidance results in this study in further research different prediction horizons can be set for fine tuning of the proposed method declaration of
