4165,climate change has already made significant alterations to various elements of the hydrologic cycle one relatively less attended hydrologic impact of climate change is on the landscape freeze thaw ft which largely affects surface and sub surface hydrology phenology and land atmospheric interactions particularly in cold regions understanding the impacts of climate change on ft patterns however is not trivial due to sparse networks of in situ measurements as well as limitations in current physically based modeling schemes aiming at continuous simulations of ft states here we propose shifting the focus of ft modeling from continuous simulations in time and space and move toward statistical representations of ft characteristics at larger temporal and spatial scales we accordingly suggest using copulas to formally describe the impacts of temperature alterations on ft characteristics using conditional probabilities to showcase the application of this framework in practice we pair datasets of satellite based ft with gridded temperature over québec canada the results show strong and rather unique dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics across different regions and or timeframes our findings demonstrate copulas as effective tools to capture such dependencies and to reconstruct marginal ft characteristics through a set of impact assessments it is shown that a similar change in temperature conditions can result in different regional responses in landscape ft these responses are often nonsymmetric meaning that the magnitude of change in ft conditions can be different under warming and cooling conditions in addition we highlight intensifications in ft responses to a similar magnitude of change in temperature under more recent years which is linked to alterations in dependencies between temperature and ft this study provides another line of evidence for complex responses of landscape ft to climate change keywords freeze thaw cold region hydrology gridded datasets copulas conditional probabilities québec 1 introduction landscape freeze and thaw ft is arguably one of the most important land surface characteristics in cold regions ft acts as a controller to various natural processes taking place in the critical zone kim et al 2019 wang et al 2019 including bulk density and hydraulic conductivity that determine the storage and movement of moisture and nutrients elliott and henry 2009 han et al 2020 henry 2013 when soil freezes hydraulic conductivity reduces mccauley et al 2002 leading to decreasing infiltration and increasing surface transport iwata et al 2010 qi et al 2019 zheng et al 2018 when the landscape thaws water pathways are formed below and above the land surface and in some regions surface and sub surface water reserves connect to one another johansson et al 2015 karlsson et al 2013 transitions between frozen and thawed states are also important drivers for erosion in natural and built environments kimiaghalam et al 2015 kreyling et al 2006 and therefore are important considerations for the design and operation of infrastructure in cold regions roseen et al 2012 shahrajabian and behfarnia 2018 ft dynamics also control the vegetation growth posing seasonal constraints on agriculture and ecosystem livelihood sharma et al 2006 zhou et al 2015 statistical characteristics of ft states such as its timing and duration can be determined by the soil temperature dynamics depending largely on the air temperature frauenfeld et al 2004 he et al 2015 shati et al 2018 the global air temperature has been increasing in the recent past due to the increased anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions since the mid 19th century francey et al 2010 huang et al 2017 the warming pattern has higher rates across northern latitudes ipcc 2013 rosenzweig et al 2008 particularly during winter and spring smith et al 2004 this unprecedented warming has already affected ft dynamics by decreasing frozen periods kim et al 2014 kim et al 2015 deepening active soil layer qin et al 2016 wu and zhang 2010 zhao et al 2010 as well as retreating permafrost boundaries lawrence et al 2008 schuur and abbott 2011 these changes can impact regional hydrology genxu et al 2017 krogh et al 2017 liu et al 2009 pedology hachem et al 2012 park et al 2016a phenology white et al 2009 williams et al 2015 water quality meshesha et al 2020 wei et al 2017 and land atmospheric interactions entekhabi et al 2004 vogel et al 2017 changes in landscape ft can result in environmental and socio economic challenges that can be accompanied with opportunities for new development in northern countries such as canada ho and gough 2006 for instance frozen landscape and short growing seasons that have constrained agricultural activities in the north are about to be replaced by warm and extended growing seasons making new opportunities for growing crops over northern lands king et al 2018 parry 2019 warmer temperature with the help of technological advancements makes other resources such as oil and gas and minerals accessible poppel et al 2015 on the other hand the changing ft dynamics can also pose considerable challenges as the agriculture and natural resources industry enters in northern regions environmental risk particularly in terms of contamination increases ali 2009 in addition as soil thaws near a hillside or a stream it can trigger erosions and landslides lewkowicz and way 2019 patton et al 2019 localized thawing especially in northern villages undermines roads and schools cracks pipelines and deteriorates infrastructures hjort et al 2018 melvin et al 2017 teufel and sushama 2019 this has major societal implications as these communities mainly indigenous have faced longstanding inequalities moreover as the north thaws and businesses are spreading northward the unique way of life and cultural values of indigenous people become largely vulnerable andrews et al 2016 last but not the least thawing soil can unleash substantial amounts of carbon into the atmosphere butterbach bahl and wolf 2017 mu et al 2015 a threat that has not been fully accounted for in climate models knoblauch et al 2018 plaza et al 2019 while current studies provide clear lines of evidence for impacts of warming temperature on ft states across cold regions they are mainly based on in situ data fang et al 2019 smith et al 2004 tran et al 2018 for instance henry 2008 studied the impacts of winter s temperature on soil frozen days and ft cycles in 31 in situ stations across canada indicating higher impacts of warming on ft dynamics in southern regions while in situ observations provide valuable local knowledge on the linkage between ft characteristics and air temperature sparse observation networks and the lack of continuous data availability limit capturing spatial and temporal patterns of ft at the larger scales takala et al 2009 williams et al 2000 zhang et al 2007 in addition current physically based modeling capability is limited due lack of process representations cao et al 2020 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 and limited data availability for model parametrizations mccarty et al 2020 tape et al 2018 this study is an effort to address some of the gaps in in situ data and physically based models we recognize that the advent of satellite technology provides a new opportunity to overcome some of the limitations of in situ observations at least at larger scales kim et al 2011 tucker et al 2005 zhang and armstrong 2001 the remotely sensed ft data can be further paired with the gridded temperature records to investigate the statistical link between air temperature and ft dynamics in addition quantifying ft response to changing climate conditions requires implementing mathematical models that can project the future states of ft based on relevant climate and or environmental variables sinha and cherkauer 2008 here we shift the purpose of modeling from continuous simulations of ft states to statistical modeling of ft characteristics over coarser temporal and spatial scales using joint dependencies with temperature if the joint dependence between ft and temperature characteristics can be formed then the statistical properties of ft conditioned to temperature can be quantified we suggest using copulas to represent and quantify these dependencies and their changes in time and space the copula methodology is a formal framework to describe joint distribution between two or more variables favre et al 2004 and has gained enormous popularity in hydrology in recent years chen et al 2019 de michele and salvadori 2003 jalili pirani and najafi 2020 particularly to assess the changes in the depednece structure over time singh et al 2021 tebaldi and sansó 2009 as well as investigating the conditional control of one variable on another huning and aghakouchak 2018 madadgar et al 2013 we showcase the application of the proposed framework in the province of québec the largest province in canada with diverse ecological and landscape characteristics we specifically illustrate i how ft characteristics and temperature are linked across a range of spatial and temporal scales in québec ii how such interdependencies can change in time and space and iii how changes in temperature conditions can affect ft characteristics across different regions and timeframes in québec the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the proposed methodology section 3 introduces the case study and datasets used section 4 provides results with respect to the first and second research questions outlined above in section 5 various examples are presented to pursue the third research question section 6 summarizes and concludes this study and provides some further remarks 2 methodology our proposed framework is developed to serve two key purposes first we aim at formal inspection of the dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics and their variations in time and space second we aim at providing a bottom up basis for addressing the impact of changing temperature on ft characteristics the proposed framework is shown in fig 1 and starts with a preprocessing step for matching gridded ft and temperature datasets we skip describing this step and will come back to it in section 3 methodologically the framework starts with measuring dependence between ft and temperature characteristics we use kendall s tau a non parametric measure for quantifying the associations between a pair of random variables nelsen 2006 kendall s tau is calculated using eq 1 where x y are considered random variables n c and n d are the number of concordant and discordant pairs of x and y the significance of a kendall s tau measure is assessed by a p value genest and favre 2007 chosen in this paper as 0 05 1 τ x y n c n d n 2 to quantitatively describe the joint dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics we use bivariate copulas in simple words a copula is a continuous parametric function coupling cumulative distribution functions cdfs of two or more marginal variables to come up with a joint cdf salvadori et al 2016 if x and y are two random variables with marginal cdfs of f 1 x and f 2 y then the joint dependencies structure h x y can be described as 2 h x y c f 1 x f 2 y where c is the bivariate copula describing the joint dependence between f 1 x and f 2 y the theoretical work of sklar 1959 shows that the joint cdfs formulated by copulas are equivalent to the joint cdfs of the initial random variables from which the marginal cdfs are inferred an important benefit of the copula methodology is in separating the description of marginal distribution from the joint dependence structure this provides an opportunity for addressing whether changes in ft characteristics are solely related to marginal changes in the air temperature or the changes in the association between air temperature and ft states the procedure of model identification parametrization and validation of copula models has been discussed in detail in several other sources e g genest and favre 2007 nazemi and elshorbagy 2012 as well as sadegh et al 2017 and is not repeated again here the specific setups for model identification and parametrization of copula models in this study are introduced in section 3 when the copula model is established fig 2 a it can be used for two purposes 1 as a stochastic simulator to regenerate pairs of temperature and ft conditions from the copula space fig 2b and 2 as a basis to estimate the probability distribution of ft characteristic under a known temperature condition fig 2c regarding the first purpose the resampled pairs of temperature and ft characteristics can be used to re estimate the kendall s tau coefficient eq 1 which can accordingly demonstrate how well the copula model is able to reconstruct the empirical dependence this can be used as a basis for validating the parametrized copula model aas and berg 2009 berg and aas 2007 hatami and nazemi 2019 in addition if the same analysis is repeated in a different timeframe and or region using an identical copula structure then the difference in characteristics of simulated samples of kendall s tau coefficients can be used as a basis to formally inspect the variations in the dependence structure across time and space here we use the one way analysis of variance anova with bonferroni correction bland and altman 1995 stuart and jones 2006 nazemi et al 2020 to formally examine the changes in the simulated samples of kendall s tau coefficients between ft characteristics and temperature conditions obtained in different regions and or timeframes here the anova test analyzes the probability distribution of resampled kendall s tau coefficients over different regions and or timeframes to find a notion for statistical difference in the dependence structure in time and space the null hypothesis of the anova test in this study is that the expected kendall s tau coefficients in two samples of simulated kendall s tau coefficients obtained at two different regions and or timeframes are the same the test can be rejected at a particular significance level indicating meaningful differences in the dependence structure of temperature and ft characteristics here we choose p values 0 05 as the threshold in which the null hypothesis of the anova test is rejected verifying a meaningful difference in estimated kendall s tau coefficients in different regions and or timeframes the bonferroni correction allows for multiple pairwise comparisons among samples with more than two variable maity et al 2016 nayak and villarini 2018 changes in the dependence structure obtained during a unique time period over different regions can show the impacts of land surface characteristics such as vegetation type elevation slope and latitude on regulating the control of temperature on ft characteristics in parallel changes in the dependence structure in a given region but in different timeframes can highlight temporal variations in the dependence between ft characteristics and temperature conditions and can be taken as the revelation of climate change the parametrized copula model can also serve as a probabilistic impact model with which the control of temperature on ft characteristics can be described through the general rule of conditional probability considering the same notation as eqs 1 and 2 y can be conditioned to x at a given x within the empirical range as nelsen 2006 bouezmarni et al 2019 3 f 2 y y x x h x x y y f 1 x x c f 1 x x f 2 y f 1 x x c f 1 x f 2 y f 1 x x x the above conditional modeling is generic and has been applied in several studies in hydrology grimaldi and serinaldi 2006a b nazemi et al 2013 2020 salvadori and michele 2007 among several others here it can provide a generic basis for quantifying the impact of changing temperature on altering the ft conditions the procedure of quantifying the conditional control can be described as the following i obtain the marginal cdfs i e f 1 x and f 2 y of random variables x and y ii seek and establish the joint distribution using bivariate copula c f 1 x f 2 y iii estimate the copula parameter s using observed datasets iv obtain the conditional cdf of target variable here y subject to a particular value of the conditioning variable here x at x x using eq 3 v back transform the conditional cdf of target variable i e f 2 y y x x from the cdf space to the quantile space using the inverse cumulative distribution function 3 case study and implementation to showcase the application of the proposed framework we consider the largest province in canada québec qc with the elevation varying from 0 to 1652 m québec has a total area of 1 542 056 km2 from which 176 928 km2 are waterbodies making québec the richest canadian jurisdiction in terms of available surface water resources atlas of canada 2016 with eight distinct ecological units known as ecozones wiken 1986 québec is the richest canadian region in terms of ecosystem diversity delineating the whole québec area to ecozones provides an opportunity to assess the potential changes in temperature control on the ft characteristics across different ecological sub regions the eight ecozones covering québec include northern arctic 2 3 of the area coops et al 2008 southern arctic 10 4 of the area coops et al 2008 arctic cordillera 0 8 of the area lespinas et al 2015 taiga shield 34 8 of the area marshall et al 1999 hudson plains 2 4 of the area goodbody et al 2020 boreal shield 42 7 of the area rowe and sheard 1981 ireson et al 2015 mixed wood plains 1 7 of the area kerr and cihlar 2004 and atlantic maritime 4 3 of the area lespinas et al 2015 these ecozones are named from north to south by ids of ez1 to ez8 respectively see fig 3 to extract ft characteristics we use the global landscape ft earth system data record ft esdr available from national snow and ice data center nsidc https doi org 10 5067 measures cryosphere nsidc 0477 004 the dataset includes daily ft states based on four classes of 1 am and pm frozen 2 am and pm non frozen 3 am frozen and pm thawed transitional and 4 am thawed and pm frozen inverse transitional with spatial resolution of 25 25 km2 over the period of 1979 2017 kim et al 2017 by having the gridded daily ft states various ft characteristics can be extracted across multiple temporal and spatial scales each having different relevance and implications as an example annual number of frozen days at each grid can reveal the temporal alterations in the frozen period at the grid scale similarly the number of frozen days from all grids in one ecozone can provide a notion for spatiotemporal variations in the number of frozen days in a given ecozone period as another example the expected daily percentage of frozen area can be calculated at each ecozone to provide a notion for how the total area of frozen land can change across different regions table 1 summarizes the list of ft characteristics considered in this study which can be categorized into three categories the first category of ft variables includes three ft characteristics related to the duration of events at the grid and or ecozone scales namely number of frozen days hereafter fd number of thawed days hereafter td and number of transient days either as transitional or inverse transitions hereafter ftd fd td and ftd are defined as the total number of days with the above mentioned states at annual seasonal and monthly scales note that the annual ft characteristics are calculated from the month of september of each year to the month of august of the year after in contrast to a julian and or hydrologic years this ft year in suggested to capture the time in which the majority of the landscape is thawed and a fresh cycle of ft is recurring kim et al 2017 park et al 2016a for monthly ft characteristics and for the sake of brevity we only focus on the months of april october and january as the representative months in the spring fall and winter seasons the second category of variables includes expected monthly extents of daily frozen and thawed areas hereafter efa and eta respectively as well as the monthly variability in daily extents of frozen and thawed areas hereafter vfa and vta respectively the variables are only calculated in representative months of april october and january as their seasonal and annual estimates are not informative due to high variability of daily ft extents over coarser temporal scales the last variable investigated is the annual permafrost extent hereafter pe defined as the percentage of the land where the annual fd is higher than sum of annual td and ftd dobinski 2011 park et al 2016b pe is relevant in the northern ecozones ez1 to ez4 we obtain the temperature dataset from the global meteorological forcing dataset gmfd https hydrology princeton edu data pgf php gmfd includes global near surface meteorological data with various spatial resolutions and is constructed by combining the reanalysis products from national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research and a group of global observation datasets providing higher global accuracy as well as better temporal and spatial consistency comparing to conventional reanalysis products sheffield et al 2006 the data has been widely used to support large scale hydrologic and land surface modeling efforts funk et al 2015 haile et al 2019 sheffield et al 2012 we consider gridded records of daily maximum and minimum temperature from gmfd to estimate the daily mean temperature at 0 25 0 25 from 1979 to 2016 overlapping with the available data for the ft characteristics prior to any further analysis we transfer the temperature and ft data into a unique spatial scale by considering the grids of ft esdr as the reference we use the k nearest neighbor interpolation steinfeld et al 2020 to estimate the mean daily temperature at the same grid resolution as ft data in brief k nearest neighbor is a non parametric geostatistical method to estimate a variable in an unknown point based on its known neighborhood fekete et al 2001 grant et al 2008 the nearest neighbors are identified here as those with the smallest euclidian distance to the centers of ft esdr grids by performing a series of numerical experiments we find that considering four nearest neighbors can provide the highest accuracy in modeling the mean and standard deviation of daily temperature dataset over different ecozones as well as the québec as a whole hatami and nazemi 2019 the regridded estimations of mean daily temperature are then used to estimate temperature conditions and to pair them with ft characteristics at the same temporal and spatial scales the utilized dataset in this study along with additional data related to snow cover and snow depth elevation land use and land cover as well as existing in situ climatic and hydrometric networks are available through the cold region data accessibility portal for québec crdap qc nazemi et al 2021 we apply the proposed methodology in fig 1 to diagnose represent and quantify the control of temperature on ft characteristics as the marginal variables should be independent and identically distributed random variables we first study the existence of autocorrelation in the temperature and ft data based on the results the autocorrelation is only relevant in annual gridded temperature and less than 17 of grids with no obvious geographic concentration these grids are excluded from the analysis at the annual scale note that autocorrelation could have been theoretically removed using e g a simple regression model see jalili pirani and najafi 2020 however this would have caused the issue of heterogeneity in our comparing our results with those grids in which autocorrelation was not removed considering other spatial and temporal scales no significant autocorrelation structure is found in neither temperature nor ft characteristics we consider three frequently used and parsimonious bivariate copula structures i e gaussian frank and clayton copula families arns et al 2017 liu et al 2020 shi et al 2020 to find the best copula to describe the joint interdependencies between ft and temperature characteristics across québec these copulas are considered due to their simplicity as well as generation properties and the fact that they together can represent a wide range of dependencies with different characteristics nelsen 2006 we use empirical distribution to describe marginal characteristics of ft and temperature as a result any difference between the performances of copula models can be referred to the difference in considered copula structures the method of moments is implemented to parametrize the considered copula structures oh and patton 2013 after fitting the copula models we consider comparing the simulated and observed kendall s tau coefficients between ft characteristics and temperature at the spatial and temporal scales noted in table 1 considering the overall performance the frank copula is found as the best bivariate copula structure with a good performance in modeling all cases of interdependencies considered for experimental results see hatami and nazemi 2019 it should be noted that here our focus is not on extremes and therefore representing the kendall s tau can be sufficient in studies focusing on extremes and tail dependencies other goodness of fit measures should be used to assess the performance of the fitted model genest et al 2009 nazemi and elshorbagy 2012 singh and najafi 2020 considering f 1 x and f 2 y as the marginal cdfs of random variables x and y frank copula can be described as chen et al 2017 favre et al 2004 4 c θ f 1 x f 2 y 1 θ l o g 1 e θ f 1 x 1 e θ f 2 y 1 e θ 1 θ 0 where θ is the copula parameter which is directly linked to the kendall s tau through the following equations acar et al 2011 ghotbi et al 2020 5 τ 1 4 θ θ 0 t e t 1 d t 1 we first identify the grids with significant dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics across considered temporal and spatial scales accordingly a statistical analysis is performed to quantify the changes in dependencies over space and time to address spatial variations we look into changes in the kendall s tau across different ecozones to demonstrate temporal variation we look at differences in kendall s tau between two non overlapping equally long and consecutive sub periods of 1980 1997 1 september 1979 to 31 august 1997 and 1998 2016 1 september 1997 to 31 august 2016 the analysis of spatial and temporal variations in the dependence structure is presented in section 4 in parallel using developed copulas we perform a set of impact assessments to illustrate how changes in temperature condition would result in changes in ft characteristics these examples are presented in section 5 4 large scale dependencies between freeze thaw and temperature conditions 4 1 empirical dependencies across temporal and spatial scales we first quantify the empirical dependencies between ft characteristics and temperature conditions at the grid scale and during the entire data period fig 4 summarizes the results for the annual fig 4a seasonal fig 4b and monthly fig 4c time scales in which red and blue colors indicate significant positive and negative dependencies regions with no colors are where dependencies are not significant black dots indicate grids where significant autocorrelations in temperature data are seen as noted above this condition only appears in annual temperature and in less than 17 of grids with no particular regional pattern considering annual and seasonal scales the dependencies are stronger for the case of t and fd as well as t and td compared to t and ftd except for summer the strongest dependencies between t and these ft characteristics are observed in the annual time scale as well as in spring for fd 0 45 and td 0 4 considering ftd the largest magnitude for expected dependence between t and ftd across québec is observed over winter 0 20 regarding the dependencies between t and fd as well as t and td at monthly scale it is clear that the dependencies are stronger in april 0 50 and 0 37 respectively in april significant negative and positive dependence between t and fd as well as t and td are pronounced across the province in contrast to t and ftd for which a clear departure is observed in the sign of dependence in the north positive and south negative while positive dependencies between t and ftd are stronger in northern québec in april statistically significant negative dependencies mainly take place in october across southern parts of the province fig 4 also points at spatial variations in the dependencies between t and ft conditions at the grid scale to take a closer look in fig 5 we monitor changes in regional dependencies between t and ft characteristics across ecozones and the province as a whole in each panel color bars show the sign and magnitude of significant kendall s tau during the complete data period the color code used for bars corresponds to those used for identifying ecozones in fig 3 the gray bars also show the results for québec panels a b and c correspond to the duration of ft states the spatial extent of ft states as well as the extent of permafrost area respectively considering the dependence between t and duration of ft states it is clear that the dependencies are stronger for the case of fd and td compared to ftd in addition there is a clear increase in the magnitude of dependencies between t and fd as well as t and td by moving from north to south in all time scales considered similar to the analysis made at the grid scale the dependence between t and fd as well as t and td are stronger during spring particularly in april in contrast statistically significant dependencies between t and ftd mainly happen during winter particularly in january similar to the case of fd and td the magnitude of dependence between t and ftd increases in southern ecozones over the winter season regarding the dependence between temperature and spatial extent of ft states the dependence between temperature and efa eta vfa as well as vta are more pronounced in april in the case of vfa and vta there are clear departures between the sign of dependence in the north positive and south negative considering the dependence between t and pe the negative dependencies exist in all four northern ecozones however the dependence is insignificant in ez3 and the magnitudes of dependencies are stronger in ez2 and ez4 compared to ez1 overall duration based ft characteristics i e fd td and ftd demonstrate more significant dependencies with temperature particularly in annual and seasonal scales the dependence between seasonal temperature and duration based ft characteristics spring for fd and td winter for ftd are significant in all ecozones as well as the province as a whole considering the spatial extent of ft states during april significant dependencies are observed between mean temperature and efa and vfa in all ecozones except ez1 during the same month the dependence between eta and temperature is significant across all ecozones except ez1 and ez3 and the dependence between vta and temperature is only significant across ez1 ez2 ez4 ez5 and ez7 from now on we only consider these strong and significant seasonal and monthly dependencies along with significant annual dependencies between average temperature and pe for further investigation 4 2 variations of dependencies in time and space and the suitability of copula methodology although fig 5 reveals significant dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics in most of the investigated cases two important issues require more attention first it is still unknown how well parametrized copulas can capture the observed dependence between temperature and ft characteristics across different ecozones second although empirical kendall s tau measures for the considered dependency cases are changing across different ecozones it is not yet clear how significant these differences are to address these we recalculate kendall s taus using randomly synthesized pairs of temperature and ft characteristics generated using parametrized copulas in each ecozone and compare the expected values of sampled kendall s taus with observed ones in addition by comparing the probability distributions of sampled kendall s taus across different ecozones it would be possible to formally address how dependence between temperature and ft characteristics varies across space fig 6 presents the results of this analysis in which the interquartile range and mean values of simulated kendall s taus are shown in different ecozones as well as the province positive and negative dependencies are shown with red and blue colors respectively the black dots and the solid lines within interquartile ranges represent the observed and mean values of simulated kendall s taus in each region the results show that parametrized copulas are able to capture the empirical dependencies fairly well with an overall mean relative error of 1 6 0 7 and 2 1 for duration and spatial based characteristics respectively in general ranges of simulated dependencies are less for duration based characteristics revealing more robust simulations compared to spatial indices using the one way anova we formally assess the difference between simulated kendall s taus across various ecozones the results are provided in table a1 in the appendix highlighting the uniqueness of dependence between temperature and ft characteristics in the majority of cases particularly for duration based characteristics the spring s dependence between temperature and fd is unique across all considered regions in québec for the case of td the spring s dependence is similar only between ez2 and ez7 for ftd during winter this is only the case between ez3 and ez4 for the efa during april there are similarities between ez2 and ez7 qc and ez4 as well as ez5 and ez8 for the dependence between temperature and eta during april there are clear pairwise similarities in southern regions particularly across ez4 ez5 ez6 and ez7 for dependencies between vfa and temperature during april there are similarities between the dependence structures in ez2 and ez3 as well as ez5 and ez8 for the case of dependencies between temperature and vta during april there are similarities between ez1 and ez5 as well as ez2 ez4 and ez5 dependence is similar between the annual pe and temperature only in ez2 and ez4 these significant differences in dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics across québec ecozones can reveal the role of ecosystem conditions in regulating the impact of temperature on ft characteristics in section 5 we will show how these spatial differences in dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics can translate into different responses to changing temperature conditions apart from spatial variations in the dependence structure the dependence in a given region can be also subject to change in time to assess this and using observed pairs of temperature and ft conditions in the first and second sub periods i e 1980 1997 vs 1998 to 2016 we parametrize copula models and recalculate kendall s tau dependence using randomly generated pairs of temperature and ft characteristics we accordingly compare the expected values of simulated kendall s taus with observed values fig 7 summarizes the results in which the boxplots of simulated kendall s taus related to the first and the second time episodes are displayed with gray and pink colors respectively the black dots and gray crosses represent the observed empirical and the mean of simulated dependence coefficients in each sub period as it can be seen parametrized copulas are able to capture the empirical dependencies fairly well based on the expected kendall s taus obtained through simulation parametrized copulas are able to capture the observed values of dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics with overall relative mean error of 1 2 1 9 for duration based characteristics 0 7 for spatial based characteristics similar to the results obtained in fig 6 it is clear that the range of simulated dependencies is strictly lower for duration based ft characteristics considering the dependency between temperature and fd there is a substantial increase in negative dependence over time in all ecozones as well as québec for dependency case between temperature and td the dependence is also strengthening over the second period 1998 2016 with higher rates of increase in northern ecozones the same conclusion is drawn from the results of pe to formally assess the temporal changes in the dependence structure between temperature and ft characteristics we use the corrected one way anova the results are provided in table a2 in the appendix highlighting the uniqueness of dependence between temperature and ft characteristics in the majority of comparison cases there are significant differences between temperature and duration based ft characteristics i e fd td and ftd during the first and the second sub periods across all considered regions there are more cases of similarity in dependencies between temperature and other spatial based characteristics i e efa eta vfa and vta during the first and the second sub periods in brief the dependence between temperature and efa during april is similar over time in ez2 and ez8 the dependence between temperature and eta during april is not changing in time across ez7 as well as the province although the dependence between temperature and vfa changes temporally across all ecozones of québec except ez2 it stays unchanged in the province the dependence between temperature and vta as well as the dependence between annual average temperature and pe is significantly different during the first 1980 1997 and second 1998 2016 sub periods in all considered ecozones significant temporal changes in the interdependencies between temperature and ft characteristics can be an indicator for a profound change that is not only related to the marginal characteristics of temperature and ft but the change in their joint characteristics below we discuss how these variations can result into a changing landscape response to alterations in temperature conditions 5 application examples for impact assessment section 4 provides several lines of evidence for strong dependencies between statistical properties of temperature and ft that are significantly variant in time and space in this section we demonstrate i how such dependencies can be used as a basis for assessing the impacts of temperature change on ft characteristics and ii what implications spatial and temporal variations in joint dependencies have on ft characteristics we pursue these questions through a set of illustrative examples the first two examples showcase how developed copula models can be used as a basis for estimating temporal and spatial ft characteristics given a known alteration in expected temperature conditions the third and fourth case studies demonstrate how spatial and temporal changes in dependencies can impact the ft response to changing temperature conditions 5 1 impacts of unit degree change in gridded temperature on the duration of frozen and thawed periods in spring the kendall s tau coefficients presented in fig 4 b show strong grid base dependencies between temperature and fd as well as td during spring developed copulas can provide a basis to estimate changes in these ft conditions under a prescribed change in average temperature at the grid scale eq 3 fig 8 summarizes the results for 1 c change in average temperature in which the top and bottom rows are related to fd and td respectively the left column shows the expected grid base fd and td during spring under current temperature conditions using shades of gray the middle and right columns show changes in expected ft conditions under 1 c cooling and warming respectively shades of red blue represent increasing decreasing fd and td as a result of 1 c change in temperature conditions looking at expected values under historical condition the period of fd in spring is considerably longer in the north i e ez1 to ez4 compared to the south i e ez5 to ez8 the variation in fd period in spring is ranging from 14 to 83 days in ez7 and ez1 respectively with an average of 42 days over the whole province this pattern is reversed for period of td during spring panel e in which longer thawed periods are observed in southern grids maximum of 75 days in ez8 with the mean of 34 days in the province the comparison of the change in expected fd and td in spring under 1 c alteration in average temperature indicates the higher impacts of cooling than warming for instance the impacts of 1 c cooling on fd are higher compared to that of 1 c warming in about 61 of grids over the province 1 c cooling leads to an average of roughly 5 more frozen days in spring while the same magnitude of warming causes 4 less non frozen days similarly for td higher impacts of 1 c cooling are observed in more than 66 of grids one degree cooling causes the expected td to decrease by 5 days over the province while 1 c warming increases the expected td by 3 days over québec more details related to spatial differences in the response of fd and td to temperature change in spring are discussed in section 5 3 5 2 impacts of unit degree temperature change on the annual permafrost extent in northern ecozones here we use the empirical dependence between pe and annual temperature as a basis to assess the impacts of changing temperature on annual pe across québec s northern ecozones similar to the example presented in section 5 1 we assume that joint dependencies and marginal distributions of temperature and pe remain unchanged in each ecozone and aim at quantifying alterations in the probability density function pdf of pe due to 1 c change in expected annual temperature this analysis is performed in ez1 ez2 and ez4 where dependencies between pe and temperature are significant we use the parametrized copula model in each ecozone to estimate the pdf of pe corresponding to 1 c change as well no change in the expected temperature fig 9 summarizes the results in which panels a to c show this analysis for ez1 ez2 and ez4 respectively pdfs corresponding to 1 c cooling no change and 1 c warming are shown in blue black and red pdf of observed values over each ecozone is displayed with a dashed black line comparison between the observed pdfs with simulated ones for no change conditions dashed vs solid black pdfs highlights the ability of the proposed framework to capture the observed statistics of pe over three studied ecozones the parametrized copulas can effectively represent the 1st 2nd and 3rd moments of pe with overall expected relative errors of 1 7 7 8 and 11 2 considering changes in temperature conditions the results show considerably higher impacts of 1 c warming compared to the same magnitude of cooling in ez1 9 decrease vs 5 7 increase and ez2 12 9 decrease vs 11 increase this is different in ez4 where the expected shift in pe due to unit degree cooling is higher than warming 2 5 increase vs 0 9 decrease in panel d the likelihood of pe being larger than the expected pe during historical condition is presented under the three temperature scenarios in ez1 the exceedance probability decreases from 67 5 for 1 c cooling to 34 1 for 1 c warming this alteration is more intense in ez2 where the exceedance probability decreases from 73 9 for 1 c cooling to 15 5 for 1 c warming in ez4 the rate of change is from 63 5 for 1 c cooling to 13 4 for 1 c warming the results clearly show the nonsymmetric response of pe to a unit degree changes in temperature 5 3 regional impact of changing temperature on duration of frozen and thawed periods in spring to showcase how ft characteristics can change spatially due to unique changes in temperature characteristics we implement a bottom up assessment to quantify expected changes in the long term average of fd and td in spring given a range of changes in expected temperature at each ecozone we consider the change in mean temperature at each ecozone from 2 c to 2 c with a sampling step of 0 5 c fig 10 summarizes the results of this analysis in which the left and right panels are related to fd and td respectively each row is related to specific ecozones ordered from north top to south bottom red blue color is the indicator of increasing decreasing changes in the long term average of fd and td at each ecozone considering unique changes in temperature conditions it is clear that the changes in spring s fd due to identical change in regional temperature is considerably higher in northern ecozones while td is more sensitive to changes in expected temperature in southern ecozones due to 2 c cooling warming for instance the increase decrease in the long term average of spring s fd is ranging from 10 8 to 6 5 days in ez1 and ez8 respectively these shifts for td are 4 4 and 10 9 days in ez1 and ez8 for 2 c cooling warming respectively moreover the comparison of changes in expected spring s fd as a result of a unique magnitude of positive and negative changes in average temperature conditions indicates the higher impacts of cooling than warming the average increase in fd over all ecozones due to 2 c cooling temperature conditions is 7 days while due to 2 c warming the average decrease in fd is 6 days similarly looking at changes in expected td the results highlight the higher sensitivity to cooling temperature conditions comparing to the same magnitude of warming over all ecozones on average 2 c cooling warming leads to an average of 7 less 6 more thawed days in spring the higher impacts of cooling is consistent with the results obtained at grid scale in section 5 1 5 4 impacts of changing regional dependencies on mean and variance of frozen area during april as noted in section 4 2 dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics are subject to significant temporal changes in the majority of comparison cases here we investigate how temporal changes in dependence structures can alter the response of ft characteristics to unique changes in temperature conditions to showcase this we quantify the impact of unit degree warming on efa and vfa during april in two distinct time episodes of 1980 1997 and 1998 2016 across québec s ecozones and the province as a whole the results are shown in fig 11 where the top and bottom panels correspond to efa and vfa respectively four colored interquartile ranges are shown for each region except for ez1 where the dependencies are not significant for each region light gray and red show the interquartile ranges corresponding to historical temperature conditions for the periods of 1980 1997 and 1998 2016 respectively in parallel dark gray and red show the impact of 1 c warming during each sub period for each range the corresponding mean ensemble is depicted with black dots and the long term average of ft characteristics during the entire data period is displayed with black lines by looking at the shifts in interquartile ranges and the mean values of both efa and vfa higher alterations are observed during the second period in most regions particularly in southern ecozones as well as the province as a whole over québec for instance the decline in long term average efa due to 1 c warming is 6 6 for 1980 1997 compared to 9 6 for 1998 2016 these shifts are respectively 1 1980 1997 vs 4 1998 2016 for vfa over québec the intensifying impact of 1 c warming on efa during the second period is vividly observed in ez5 where there are shifts of 9 in long term average values over 1998 2016 comparing to only 4 over 1980 1997 for vfa over ez5 decreases of 9 and 2 in expected values are estimated over the second and first half sub periods respectively also by looking at vfa over both time episodes a unit degree warming leads to an increase decrease in interquartile ranges as well as expected values over northern southern ecozones this effect is consistent with the changes in sign of dependence between temperatures vfa over the different region fig 5b the nonstationary in the dependence structure has been reported in some other studies looking at climate variables in canada e g singh and najafi 2020 singh et al 2021 and deserves giving more attention 6 summary and conclusion recurring cycles of ft are among the most important landscape features in cold regions controlling various environmental processes below and above the soil as the dynamics of ft are largely governed by the near surface air temperature warming climate can alter historical characteristics of ft quite substantially and such changes have been already observed across cold regions having said that there are still several rooms for improving our knowledge about the effects of warming climate on ft patterns under current and future conditions first and foremost the current understandings about the alterations in ft patterns and how they relate to the warming climate are mainly built on in situ measurements that are crucial yet sparse and locally relevant second projecting ft characteristics under future conditions is not trivial due to the limitations in available datasets and or process representations in current hydrology and land surface models third it is not yet clear whether changes in the ft characteristics are solely due to changes in temperature conditions or it is due to a more profound change in the relationship between temperature and ft characteristics at the landscape scale to tackle these questions we suggest shifting the focus of ft modeling from continuous descriptions of ft states in time and space to quantifications of statistical properties of ft variables at coarser temporal and spatial scales we accordingly propose using copulas a set of generic multivariate mathematical functions that quantify dependence between random variables to formally account for the link between temperature and ft variables at relevant scales using copulas we can 1 describe the statistical dependence between temperature and ft variables 2 diagnose temporal and spatial variations in the dependence and 3 estimate ft characteristics conditioned to a given change in temperature to showcase the application of the developed modeling framework we consider the province of québec the largest province in canada over the period between 1979 and 2016 we consider pairing a global satellite based ft with a gridded climate datasets and extract a number of ft variables across a range of temporal and spatial scales the results of this study reveal the existence of strong dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics relatively speaking the dependence between temperature and duration of frozen and thawed states are stronger particularly during spring and in april when significant dependencies between temperature and spatial extent of ft are also observed the empirical dependencies that are extracted from the gridded datasets can be reconstructed using the parameterized copulas in general the ranges of simulated dependencies are less for duration based ft characteristics revealing better capability of copula models in representing the empirical dependence between temperature and duration based compared to spatial ft characteristics our findings clearly highlight significant variations in the dependencies across time and space most importantly the magnitudes of dependencies between temperature and duration of ft states increase by moving from north to south and in more recent time episodes 1998 2016 these changes can reveal the role of ecosystem conditions and or climate change in regulating the impact of temperature on ft characteristics using parametrized copula models we show the nonsymmetric response of ft characteristics to temperature change as an example the comparison of the change in expected fd and td in spring under 1 alteration in average temperature indicates the higher impacts of cooling than warming across spatial scales from grid to ecozone to the whole province we also show that a similar magnitude of change causes higher impacts under more recent dependencies particularly in southern ecozones as well as the province as a whole the intensifying impact of temperature change under changing dependence conditions can be vividly seen in hudson plains areas within québec for which the impact of 1 c warming on vfa is up to 4 5 times more under dependencies observed in 1998 2016 compared to 1980 1997 these findings point at a complex and multifaceted nature of climate change impacts on ft conditions caused by both variations in marginal characteristics of temperature as well as joint dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics although this method is applied in québec and using a particular dataset it is globally relevant and can be implemented through pairing other relevant datasets too having said that still several improvements can be made first and foremost although air temperature is the most influencing climate variables on ft characteristics other variables such as snow cover and depth can also influence ft patterns iwata et al 2010 yi et al 2015 including more climate variables require going beyond bivariate copulas and inevitably lead to more computational complexities particularly with respect to conditional modeling but it is a necessary step toward a better understanding of ft patterns under changing conditions second it is not yet clear how much the findings are sensitive to specific datasets from which temperature and ft characteristics along with their joint dependencies are inferred this requires performing systematic sensitivity and intercomparison studies which is an important step towards quantifying uncertainty in our findings in québec and should be also considered in other regions we hope that this study can inspire more efforts towards better understandings of landscape responses in changing cold regions

4165,climate change has already made significant alterations to various elements of the hydrologic cycle one relatively less attended hydrologic impact of climate change is on the landscape freeze thaw ft which largely affects surface and sub surface hydrology phenology and land atmospheric interactions particularly in cold regions understanding the impacts of climate change on ft patterns however is not trivial due to sparse networks of in situ measurements as well as limitations in current physically based modeling schemes aiming at continuous simulations of ft states here we propose shifting the focus of ft modeling from continuous simulations in time and space and move toward statistical representations of ft characteristics at larger temporal and spatial scales we accordingly suggest using copulas to formally describe the impacts of temperature alterations on ft characteristics using conditional probabilities to showcase the application of this framework in practice we pair datasets of satellite based ft with gridded temperature over québec canada the results show strong and rather unique dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics across different regions and or timeframes our findings demonstrate copulas as effective tools to capture such dependencies and to reconstruct marginal ft characteristics through a set of impact assessments it is shown that a similar change in temperature conditions can result in different regional responses in landscape ft these responses are often nonsymmetric meaning that the magnitude of change in ft conditions can be different under warming and cooling conditions in addition we highlight intensifications in ft responses to a similar magnitude of change in temperature under more recent years which is linked to alterations in dependencies between temperature and ft this study provides another line of evidence for complex responses of landscape ft to climate change keywords freeze thaw cold region hydrology gridded datasets copulas conditional probabilities québec 1 introduction landscape freeze and thaw ft is arguably one of the most important land surface characteristics in cold regions ft acts as a controller to various natural processes taking place in the critical zone kim et al 2019 wang et al 2019 including bulk density and hydraulic conductivity that determine the storage and movement of moisture and nutrients elliott and henry 2009 han et al 2020 henry 2013 when soil freezes hydraulic conductivity reduces mccauley et al 2002 leading to decreasing infiltration and increasing surface transport iwata et al 2010 qi et al 2019 zheng et al 2018 when the landscape thaws water pathways are formed below and above the land surface and in some regions surface and sub surface water reserves connect to one another johansson et al 2015 karlsson et al 2013 transitions between frozen and thawed states are also important drivers for erosion in natural and built environments kimiaghalam et al 2015 kreyling et al 2006 and therefore are important considerations for the design and operation of infrastructure in cold regions roseen et al 2012 shahrajabian and behfarnia 2018 ft dynamics also control the vegetation growth posing seasonal constraints on agriculture and ecosystem livelihood sharma et al 2006 zhou et al 2015 statistical characteristics of ft states such as its timing and duration can be determined by the soil temperature dynamics depending largely on the air temperature frauenfeld et al 2004 he et al 2015 shati et al 2018 the global air temperature has been increasing in the recent past due to the increased anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions since the mid 19th century francey et al 2010 huang et al 2017 the warming pattern has higher rates across northern latitudes ipcc 2013 rosenzweig et al 2008 particularly during winter and spring smith et al 2004 this unprecedented warming has already affected ft dynamics by decreasing frozen periods kim et al 2014 kim et al 2015 deepening active soil layer qin et al 2016 wu and zhang 2010 zhao et al 2010 as well as retreating permafrost boundaries lawrence et al 2008 schuur and abbott 2011 these changes can impact regional hydrology genxu et al 2017 krogh et al 2017 liu et al 2009 pedology hachem et al 2012 park et al 2016a phenology white et al 2009 williams et al 2015 water quality meshesha et al 2020 wei et al 2017 and land atmospheric interactions entekhabi et al 2004 vogel et al 2017 changes in landscape ft can result in environmental and socio economic challenges that can be accompanied with opportunities for new development in northern countries such as canada ho and gough 2006 for instance frozen landscape and short growing seasons that have constrained agricultural activities in the north are about to be replaced by warm and extended growing seasons making new opportunities for growing crops over northern lands king et al 2018 parry 2019 warmer temperature with the help of technological advancements makes other resources such as oil and gas and minerals accessible poppel et al 2015 on the other hand the changing ft dynamics can also pose considerable challenges as the agriculture and natural resources industry enters in northern regions environmental risk particularly in terms of contamination increases ali 2009 in addition as soil thaws near a hillside or a stream it can trigger erosions and landslides lewkowicz and way 2019 patton et al 2019 localized thawing especially in northern villages undermines roads and schools cracks pipelines and deteriorates infrastructures hjort et al 2018 melvin et al 2017 teufel and sushama 2019 this has major societal implications as these communities mainly indigenous have faced longstanding inequalities moreover as the north thaws and businesses are spreading northward the unique way of life and cultural values of indigenous people become largely vulnerable andrews et al 2016 last but not the least thawing soil can unleash substantial amounts of carbon into the atmosphere butterbach bahl and wolf 2017 mu et al 2015 a threat that has not been fully accounted for in climate models knoblauch et al 2018 plaza et al 2019 while current studies provide clear lines of evidence for impacts of warming temperature on ft states across cold regions they are mainly based on in situ data fang et al 2019 smith et al 2004 tran et al 2018 for instance henry 2008 studied the impacts of winter s temperature on soil frozen days and ft cycles in 31 in situ stations across canada indicating higher impacts of warming on ft dynamics in southern regions while in situ observations provide valuable local knowledge on the linkage between ft characteristics and air temperature sparse observation networks and the lack of continuous data availability limit capturing spatial and temporal patterns of ft at the larger scales takala et al 2009 williams et al 2000 zhang et al 2007 in addition current physically based modeling capability is limited due lack of process representations cao et al 2020 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 and limited data availability for model parametrizations mccarty et al 2020 tape et al 2018 this study is an effort to address some of the gaps in in situ data and physically based models we recognize that the advent of satellite technology provides a new opportunity to overcome some of the limitations of in situ observations at least at larger scales kim et al 2011 tucker et al 2005 zhang and armstrong 2001 the remotely sensed ft data can be further paired with the gridded temperature records to investigate the statistical link between air temperature and ft dynamics in addition quantifying ft response to changing climate conditions requires implementing mathematical models that can project the future states of ft based on relevant climate and or environmental variables sinha and cherkauer 2008 here we shift the purpose of modeling from continuous simulations of ft states to statistical modeling of ft characteristics over coarser temporal and spatial scales using joint dependencies with temperature if the joint dependence between ft and temperature characteristics can be formed then the statistical properties of ft conditioned to temperature can be quantified we suggest using copulas to represent and quantify these dependencies and their changes in time and space the copula methodology is a formal framework to describe joint distribution between two or more variables favre et al 2004 and has gained enormous popularity in hydrology in recent years chen et al 2019 de michele and salvadori 2003 jalili pirani and najafi 2020 particularly to assess the changes in the depednece structure over time singh et al 2021 tebaldi and sansó 2009 as well as investigating the conditional control of one variable on another huning and aghakouchak 2018 madadgar et al 2013 we showcase the application of the proposed framework in the province of québec the largest province in canada with diverse ecological and landscape characteristics we specifically illustrate i how ft characteristics and temperature are linked across a range of spatial and temporal scales in québec ii how such interdependencies can change in time and space and iii how changes in temperature conditions can affect ft characteristics across different regions and timeframes in québec the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the proposed methodology section 3 introduces the case study and datasets used section 4 provides results with respect to the first and second research questions outlined above in section 5 various examples are presented to pursue the third research question section 6 summarizes and concludes this study and provides some further remarks 2 methodology our proposed framework is developed to serve two key purposes first we aim at formal inspection of the dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics and their variations in time and space second we aim at providing a bottom up basis for addressing the impact of changing temperature on ft characteristics the proposed framework is shown in fig 1 and starts with a preprocessing step for matching gridded ft and temperature datasets we skip describing this step and will come back to it in section 3 methodologically the framework starts with measuring dependence between ft and temperature characteristics we use kendall s tau a non parametric measure for quantifying the associations between a pair of random variables nelsen 2006 kendall s tau is calculated using eq 1 where x y are considered random variables n c and n d are the number of concordant and discordant pairs of x and y the significance of a kendall s tau measure is assessed by a p value genest and favre 2007 chosen in this paper as 0 05 1 τ x y n c n d n 2 to quantitatively describe the joint dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics we use bivariate copulas in simple words a copula is a continuous parametric function coupling cumulative distribution functions cdfs of two or more marginal variables to come up with a joint cdf salvadori et al 2016 if x and y are two random variables with marginal cdfs of f 1 x and f 2 y then the joint dependencies structure h x y can be described as 2 h x y c f 1 x f 2 y where c is the bivariate copula describing the joint dependence between f 1 x and f 2 y the theoretical work of sklar 1959 shows that the joint cdfs formulated by copulas are equivalent to the joint cdfs of the initial random variables from which the marginal cdfs are inferred an important benefit of the copula methodology is in separating the description of marginal distribution from the joint dependence structure this provides an opportunity for addressing whether changes in ft characteristics are solely related to marginal changes in the air temperature or the changes in the association between air temperature and ft states the procedure of model identification parametrization and validation of copula models has been discussed in detail in several other sources e g genest and favre 2007 nazemi and elshorbagy 2012 as well as sadegh et al 2017 and is not repeated again here the specific setups for model identification and parametrization of copula models in this study are introduced in section 3 when the copula model is established fig 2 a it can be used for two purposes 1 as a stochastic simulator to regenerate pairs of temperature and ft conditions from the copula space fig 2b and 2 as a basis to estimate the probability distribution of ft characteristic under a known temperature condition fig 2c regarding the first purpose the resampled pairs of temperature and ft characteristics can be used to re estimate the kendall s tau coefficient eq 1 which can accordingly demonstrate how well the copula model is able to reconstruct the empirical dependence this can be used as a basis for validating the parametrized copula model aas and berg 2009 berg and aas 2007 hatami and nazemi 2019 in addition if the same analysis is repeated in a different timeframe and or region using an identical copula structure then the difference in characteristics of simulated samples of kendall s tau coefficients can be used as a basis to formally inspect the variations in the dependence structure across time and space here we use the one way analysis of variance anova with bonferroni correction bland and altman 1995 stuart and jones 2006 nazemi et al 2020 to formally examine the changes in the simulated samples of kendall s tau coefficients between ft characteristics and temperature conditions obtained in different regions and or timeframes here the anova test analyzes the probability distribution of resampled kendall s tau coefficients over different regions and or timeframes to find a notion for statistical difference in the dependence structure in time and space the null hypothesis of the anova test in this study is that the expected kendall s tau coefficients in two samples of simulated kendall s tau coefficients obtained at two different regions and or timeframes are the same the test can be rejected at a particular significance level indicating meaningful differences in the dependence structure of temperature and ft characteristics here we choose p values 0 05 as the threshold in which the null hypothesis of the anova test is rejected verifying a meaningful difference in estimated kendall s tau coefficients in different regions and or timeframes the bonferroni correction allows for multiple pairwise comparisons among samples with more than two variable maity et al 2016 nayak and villarini 2018 changes in the dependence structure obtained during a unique time period over different regions can show the impacts of land surface characteristics such as vegetation type elevation slope and latitude on regulating the control of temperature on ft characteristics in parallel changes in the dependence structure in a given region but in different timeframes can highlight temporal variations in the dependence between ft characteristics and temperature conditions and can be taken as the revelation of climate change the parametrized copula model can also serve as a probabilistic impact model with which the control of temperature on ft characteristics can be described through the general rule of conditional probability considering the same notation as eqs 1 and 2 y can be conditioned to x at a given x within the empirical range as nelsen 2006 bouezmarni et al 2019 3 f 2 y y x x h x x y y f 1 x x c f 1 x x f 2 y f 1 x x c f 1 x f 2 y f 1 x x x the above conditional modeling is generic and has been applied in several studies in hydrology grimaldi and serinaldi 2006a b nazemi et al 2013 2020 salvadori and michele 2007 among several others here it can provide a generic basis for quantifying the impact of changing temperature on altering the ft conditions the procedure of quantifying the conditional control can be described as the following i obtain the marginal cdfs i e f 1 x and f 2 y of random variables x and y ii seek and establish the joint distribution using bivariate copula c f 1 x f 2 y iii estimate the copula parameter s using observed datasets iv obtain the conditional cdf of target variable here y subject to a particular value of the conditioning variable here x at x x using eq 3 v back transform the conditional cdf of target variable i e f 2 y y x x from the cdf space to the quantile space using the inverse cumulative distribution function 3 case study and implementation to showcase the application of the proposed framework we consider the largest province in canada québec qc with the elevation varying from 0 to 1652 m québec has a total area of 1 542 056 km2 from which 176 928 km2 are waterbodies making québec the richest canadian jurisdiction in terms of available surface water resources atlas of canada 2016 with eight distinct ecological units known as ecozones wiken 1986 québec is the richest canadian region in terms of ecosystem diversity delineating the whole québec area to ecozones provides an opportunity to assess the potential changes in temperature control on the ft characteristics across different ecological sub regions the eight ecozones covering québec include northern arctic 2 3 of the area coops et al 2008 southern arctic 10 4 of the area coops et al 2008 arctic cordillera 0 8 of the area lespinas et al 2015 taiga shield 34 8 of the area marshall et al 1999 hudson plains 2 4 of the area goodbody et al 2020 boreal shield 42 7 of the area rowe and sheard 1981 ireson et al 2015 mixed wood plains 1 7 of the area kerr and cihlar 2004 and atlantic maritime 4 3 of the area lespinas et al 2015 these ecozones are named from north to south by ids of ez1 to ez8 respectively see fig 3 to extract ft characteristics we use the global landscape ft earth system data record ft esdr available from national snow and ice data center nsidc https doi org 10 5067 measures cryosphere nsidc 0477 004 the dataset includes daily ft states based on four classes of 1 am and pm frozen 2 am and pm non frozen 3 am frozen and pm thawed transitional and 4 am thawed and pm frozen inverse transitional with spatial resolution of 25 25 km2 over the period of 1979 2017 kim et al 2017 by having the gridded daily ft states various ft characteristics can be extracted across multiple temporal and spatial scales each having different relevance and implications as an example annual number of frozen days at each grid can reveal the temporal alterations in the frozen period at the grid scale similarly the number of frozen days from all grids in one ecozone can provide a notion for spatiotemporal variations in the number of frozen days in a given ecozone period as another example the expected daily percentage of frozen area can be calculated at each ecozone to provide a notion for how the total area of frozen land can change across different regions table 1 summarizes the list of ft characteristics considered in this study which can be categorized into three categories the first category of ft variables includes three ft characteristics related to the duration of events at the grid and or ecozone scales namely number of frozen days hereafter fd number of thawed days hereafter td and number of transient days either as transitional or inverse transitions hereafter ftd fd td and ftd are defined as the total number of days with the above mentioned states at annual seasonal and monthly scales note that the annual ft characteristics are calculated from the month of september of each year to the month of august of the year after in contrast to a julian and or hydrologic years this ft year in suggested to capture the time in which the majority of the landscape is thawed and a fresh cycle of ft is recurring kim et al 2017 park et al 2016a for monthly ft characteristics and for the sake of brevity we only focus on the months of april october and january as the representative months in the spring fall and winter seasons the second category of variables includes expected monthly extents of daily frozen and thawed areas hereafter efa and eta respectively as well as the monthly variability in daily extents of frozen and thawed areas hereafter vfa and vta respectively the variables are only calculated in representative months of april october and january as their seasonal and annual estimates are not informative due to high variability of daily ft extents over coarser temporal scales the last variable investigated is the annual permafrost extent hereafter pe defined as the percentage of the land where the annual fd is higher than sum of annual td and ftd dobinski 2011 park et al 2016b pe is relevant in the northern ecozones ez1 to ez4 we obtain the temperature dataset from the global meteorological forcing dataset gmfd https hydrology princeton edu data pgf php gmfd includes global near surface meteorological data with various spatial resolutions and is constructed by combining the reanalysis products from national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research and a group of global observation datasets providing higher global accuracy as well as better temporal and spatial consistency comparing to conventional reanalysis products sheffield et al 2006 the data has been widely used to support large scale hydrologic and land surface modeling efforts funk et al 2015 haile et al 2019 sheffield et al 2012 we consider gridded records of daily maximum and minimum temperature from gmfd to estimate the daily mean temperature at 0 25 0 25 from 1979 to 2016 overlapping with the available data for the ft characteristics prior to any further analysis we transfer the temperature and ft data into a unique spatial scale by considering the grids of ft esdr as the reference we use the k nearest neighbor interpolation steinfeld et al 2020 to estimate the mean daily temperature at the same grid resolution as ft data in brief k nearest neighbor is a non parametric geostatistical method to estimate a variable in an unknown point based on its known neighborhood fekete et al 2001 grant et al 2008 the nearest neighbors are identified here as those with the smallest euclidian distance to the centers of ft esdr grids by performing a series of numerical experiments we find that considering four nearest neighbors can provide the highest accuracy in modeling the mean and standard deviation of daily temperature dataset over different ecozones as well as the québec as a whole hatami and nazemi 2019 the regridded estimations of mean daily temperature are then used to estimate temperature conditions and to pair them with ft characteristics at the same temporal and spatial scales the utilized dataset in this study along with additional data related to snow cover and snow depth elevation land use and land cover as well as existing in situ climatic and hydrometric networks are available through the cold region data accessibility portal for québec crdap qc nazemi et al 2021 we apply the proposed methodology in fig 1 to diagnose represent and quantify the control of temperature on ft characteristics as the marginal variables should be independent and identically distributed random variables we first study the existence of autocorrelation in the temperature and ft data based on the results the autocorrelation is only relevant in annual gridded temperature and less than 17 of grids with no obvious geographic concentration these grids are excluded from the analysis at the annual scale note that autocorrelation could have been theoretically removed using e g a simple regression model see jalili pirani and najafi 2020 however this would have caused the issue of heterogeneity in our comparing our results with those grids in which autocorrelation was not removed considering other spatial and temporal scales no significant autocorrelation structure is found in neither temperature nor ft characteristics we consider three frequently used and parsimonious bivariate copula structures i e gaussian frank and clayton copula families arns et al 2017 liu et al 2020 shi et al 2020 to find the best copula to describe the joint interdependencies between ft and temperature characteristics across québec these copulas are considered due to their simplicity as well as generation properties and the fact that they together can represent a wide range of dependencies with different characteristics nelsen 2006 we use empirical distribution to describe marginal characteristics of ft and temperature as a result any difference between the performances of copula models can be referred to the difference in considered copula structures the method of moments is implemented to parametrize the considered copula structures oh and patton 2013 after fitting the copula models we consider comparing the simulated and observed kendall s tau coefficients between ft characteristics and temperature at the spatial and temporal scales noted in table 1 considering the overall performance the frank copula is found as the best bivariate copula structure with a good performance in modeling all cases of interdependencies considered for experimental results see hatami and nazemi 2019 it should be noted that here our focus is not on extremes and therefore representing the kendall s tau can be sufficient in studies focusing on extremes and tail dependencies other goodness of fit measures should be used to assess the performance of the fitted model genest et al 2009 nazemi and elshorbagy 2012 singh and najafi 2020 considering f 1 x and f 2 y as the marginal cdfs of random variables x and y frank copula can be described as chen et al 2017 favre et al 2004 4 c θ f 1 x f 2 y 1 θ l o g 1 e θ f 1 x 1 e θ f 2 y 1 e θ 1 θ 0 where θ is the copula parameter which is directly linked to the kendall s tau through the following equations acar et al 2011 ghotbi et al 2020 5 τ 1 4 θ θ 0 t e t 1 d t 1 we first identify the grids with significant dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics across considered temporal and spatial scales accordingly a statistical analysis is performed to quantify the changes in dependencies over space and time to address spatial variations we look into changes in the kendall s tau across different ecozones to demonstrate temporal variation we look at differences in kendall s tau between two non overlapping equally long and consecutive sub periods of 1980 1997 1 september 1979 to 31 august 1997 and 1998 2016 1 september 1997 to 31 august 2016 the analysis of spatial and temporal variations in the dependence structure is presented in section 4 in parallel using developed copulas we perform a set of impact assessments to illustrate how changes in temperature condition would result in changes in ft characteristics these examples are presented in section 5 4 large scale dependencies between freeze thaw and temperature conditions 4 1 empirical dependencies across temporal and spatial scales we first quantify the empirical dependencies between ft characteristics and temperature conditions at the grid scale and during the entire data period fig 4 summarizes the results for the annual fig 4a seasonal fig 4b and monthly fig 4c time scales in which red and blue colors indicate significant positive and negative dependencies regions with no colors are where dependencies are not significant black dots indicate grids where significant autocorrelations in temperature data are seen as noted above this condition only appears in annual temperature and in less than 17 of grids with no particular regional pattern considering annual and seasonal scales the dependencies are stronger for the case of t and fd as well as t and td compared to t and ftd except for summer the strongest dependencies between t and these ft characteristics are observed in the annual time scale as well as in spring for fd 0 45 and td 0 4 considering ftd the largest magnitude for expected dependence between t and ftd across québec is observed over winter 0 20 regarding the dependencies between t and fd as well as t and td at monthly scale it is clear that the dependencies are stronger in april 0 50 and 0 37 respectively in april significant negative and positive dependence between t and fd as well as t and td are pronounced across the province in contrast to t and ftd for which a clear departure is observed in the sign of dependence in the north positive and south negative while positive dependencies between t and ftd are stronger in northern québec in april statistically significant negative dependencies mainly take place in october across southern parts of the province fig 4 also points at spatial variations in the dependencies between t and ft conditions at the grid scale to take a closer look in fig 5 we monitor changes in regional dependencies between t and ft characteristics across ecozones and the province as a whole in each panel color bars show the sign and magnitude of significant kendall s tau during the complete data period the color code used for bars corresponds to those used for identifying ecozones in fig 3 the gray bars also show the results for québec panels a b and c correspond to the duration of ft states the spatial extent of ft states as well as the extent of permafrost area respectively considering the dependence between t and duration of ft states it is clear that the dependencies are stronger for the case of fd and td compared to ftd in addition there is a clear increase in the magnitude of dependencies between t and fd as well as t and td by moving from north to south in all time scales considered similar to the analysis made at the grid scale the dependence between t and fd as well as t and td are stronger during spring particularly in april in contrast statistically significant dependencies between t and ftd mainly happen during winter particularly in january similar to the case of fd and td the magnitude of dependence between t and ftd increases in southern ecozones over the winter season regarding the dependence between temperature and spatial extent of ft states the dependence between temperature and efa eta vfa as well as vta are more pronounced in april in the case of vfa and vta there are clear departures between the sign of dependence in the north positive and south negative considering the dependence between t and pe the negative dependencies exist in all four northern ecozones however the dependence is insignificant in ez3 and the magnitudes of dependencies are stronger in ez2 and ez4 compared to ez1 overall duration based ft characteristics i e fd td and ftd demonstrate more significant dependencies with temperature particularly in annual and seasonal scales the dependence between seasonal temperature and duration based ft characteristics spring for fd and td winter for ftd are significant in all ecozones as well as the province as a whole considering the spatial extent of ft states during april significant dependencies are observed between mean temperature and efa and vfa in all ecozones except ez1 during the same month the dependence between eta and temperature is significant across all ecozones except ez1 and ez3 and the dependence between vta and temperature is only significant across ez1 ez2 ez4 ez5 and ez7 from now on we only consider these strong and significant seasonal and monthly dependencies along with significant annual dependencies between average temperature and pe for further investigation 4 2 variations of dependencies in time and space and the suitability of copula methodology although fig 5 reveals significant dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics in most of the investigated cases two important issues require more attention first it is still unknown how well parametrized copulas can capture the observed dependence between temperature and ft characteristics across different ecozones second although empirical kendall s tau measures for the considered dependency cases are changing across different ecozones it is not yet clear how significant these differences are to address these we recalculate kendall s taus using randomly synthesized pairs of temperature and ft characteristics generated using parametrized copulas in each ecozone and compare the expected values of sampled kendall s taus with observed ones in addition by comparing the probability distributions of sampled kendall s taus across different ecozones it would be possible to formally address how dependence between temperature and ft characteristics varies across space fig 6 presents the results of this analysis in which the interquartile range and mean values of simulated kendall s taus are shown in different ecozones as well as the province positive and negative dependencies are shown with red and blue colors respectively the black dots and the solid lines within interquartile ranges represent the observed and mean values of simulated kendall s taus in each region the results show that parametrized copulas are able to capture the empirical dependencies fairly well with an overall mean relative error of 1 6 0 7 and 2 1 for duration and spatial based characteristics respectively in general ranges of simulated dependencies are less for duration based characteristics revealing more robust simulations compared to spatial indices using the one way anova we formally assess the difference between simulated kendall s taus across various ecozones the results are provided in table a1 in the appendix highlighting the uniqueness of dependence between temperature and ft characteristics in the majority of cases particularly for duration based characteristics the spring s dependence between temperature and fd is unique across all considered regions in québec for the case of td the spring s dependence is similar only between ez2 and ez7 for ftd during winter this is only the case between ez3 and ez4 for the efa during april there are similarities between ez2 and ez7 qc and ez4 as well as ez5 and ez8 for the dependence between temperature and eta during april there are clear pairwise similarities in southern regions particularly across ez4 ez5 ez6 and ez7 for dependencies between vfa and temperature during april there are similarities between the dependence structures in ez2 and ez3 as well as ez5 and ez8 for the case of dependencies between temperature and vta during april there are similarities between ez1 and ez5 as well as ez2 ez4 and ez5 dependence is similar between the annual pe and temperature only in ez2 and ez4 these significant differences in dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics across québec ecozones can reveal the role of ecosystem conditions in regulating the impact of temperature on ft characteristics in section 5 we will show how these spatial differences in dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics can translate into different responses to changing temperature conditions apart from spatial variations in the dependence structure the dependence in a given region can be also subject to change in time to assess this and using observed pairs of temperature and ft conditions in the first and second sub periods i e 1980 1997 vs 1998 to 2016 we parametrize copula models and recalculate kendall s tau dependence using randomly generated pairs of temperature and ft characteristics we accordingly compare the expected values of simulated kendall s taus with observed values fig 7 summarizes the results in which the boxplots of simulated kendall s taus related to the first and the second time episodes are displayed with gray and pink colors respectively the black dots and gray crosses represent the observed empirical and the mean of simulated dependence coefficients in each sub period as it can be seen parametrized copulas are able to capture the empirical dependencies fairly well based on the expected kendall s taus obtained through simulation parametrized copulas are able to capture the observed values of dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics with overall relative mean error of 1 2 1 9 for duration based characteristics 0 7 for spatial based characteristics similar to the results obtained in fig 6 it is clear that the range of simulated dependencies is strictly lower for duration based ft characteristics considering the dependency between temperature and fd there is a substantial increase in negative dependence over time in all ecozones as well as québec for dependency case between temperature and td the dependence is also strengthening over the second period 1998 2016 with higher rates of increase in northern ecozones the same conclusion is drawn from the results of pe to formally assess the temporal changes in the dependence structure between temperature and ft characteristics we use the corrected one way anova the results are provided in table a2 in the appendix highlighting the uniqueness of dependence between temperature and ft characteristics in the majority of comparison cases there are significant differences between temperature and duration based ft characteristics i e fd td and ftd during the first and the second sub periods across all considered regions there are more cases of similarity in dependencies between temperature and other spatial based characteristics i e efa eta vfa and vta during the first and the second sub periods in brief the dependence between temperature and efa during april is similar over time in ez2 and ez8 the dependence between temperature and eta during april is not changing in time across ez7 as well as the province although the dependence between temperature and vfa changes temporally across all ecozones of québec except ez2 it stays unchanged in the province the dependence between temperature and vta as well as the dependence between annual average temperature and pe is significantly different during the first 1980 1997 and second 1998 2016 sub periods in all considered ecozones significant temporal changes in the interdependencies between temperature and ft characteristics can be an indicator for a profound change that is not only related to the marginal characteristics of temperature and ft but the change in their joint characteristics below we discuss how these variations can result into a changing landscape response to alterations in temperature conditions 5 application examples for impact assessment section 4 provides several lines of evidence for strong dependencies between statistical properties of temperature and ft that are significantly variant in time and space in this section we demonstrate i how such dependencies can be used as a basis for assessing the impacts of temperature change on ft characteristics and ii what implications spatial and temporal variations in joint dependencies have on ft characteristics we pursue these questions through a set of illustrative examples the first two examples showcase how developed copula models can be used as a basis for estimating temporal and spatial ft characteristics given a known alteration in expected temperature conditions the third and fourth case studies demonstrate how spatial and temporal changes in dependencies can impact the ft response to changing temperature conditions 5 1 impacts of unit degree change in gridded temperature on the duration of frozen and thawed periods in spring the kendall s tau coefficients presented in fig 4 b show strong grid base dependencies between temperature and fd as well as td during spring developed copulas can provide a basis to estimate changes in these ft conditions under a prescribed change in average temperature at the grid scale eq 3 fig 8 summarizes the results for 1 c change in average temperature in which the top and bottom rows are related to fd and td respectively the left column shows the expected grid base fd and td during spring under current temperature conditions using shades of gray the middle and right columns show changes in expected ft conditions under 1 c cooling and warming respectively shades of red blue represent increasing decreasing fd and td as a result of 1 c change in temperature conditions looking at expected values under historical condition the period of fd in spring is considerably longer in the north i e ez1 to ez4 compared to the south i e ez5 to ez8 the variation in fd period in spring is ranging from 14 to 83 days in ez7 and ez1 respectively with an average of 42 days over the whole province this pattern is reversed for period of td during spring panel e in which longer thawed periods are observed in southern grids maximum of 75 days in ez8 with the mean of 34 days in the province the comparison of the change in expected fd and td in spring under 1 c alteration in average temperature indicates the higher impacts of cooling than warming for instance the impacts of 1 c cooling on fd are higher compared to that of 1 c warming in about 61 of grids over the province 1 c cooling leads to an average of roughly 5 more frozen days in spring while the same magnitude of warming causes 4 less non frozen days similarly for td higher impacts of 1 c cooling are observed in more than 66 of grids one degree cooling causes the expected td to decrease by 5 days over the province while 1 c warming increases the expected td by 3 days over québec more details related to spatial differences in the response of fd and td to temperature change in spring are discussed in section 5 3 5 2 impacts of unit degree temperature change on the annual permafrost extent in northern ecozones here we use the empirical dependence between pe and annual temperature as a basis to assess the impacts of changing temperature on annual pe across québec s northern ecozones similar to the example presented in section 5 1 we assume that joint dependencies and marginal distributions of temperature and pe remain unchanged in each ecozone and aim at quantifying alterations in the probability density function pdf of pe due to 1 c change in expected annual temperature this analysis is performed in ez1 ez2 and ez4 where dependencies between pe and temperature are significant we use the parametrized copula model in each ecozone to estimate the pdf of pe corresponding to 1 c change as well no change in the expected temperature fig 9 summarizes the results in which panels a to c show this analysis for ez1 ez2 and ez4 respectively pdfs corresponding to 1 c cooling no change and 1 c warming are shown in blue black and red pdf of observed values over each ecozone is displayed with a dashed black line comparison between the observed pdfs with simulated ones for no change conditions dashed vs solid black pdfs highlights the ability of the proposed framework to capture the observed statistics of pe over three studied ecozones the parametrized copulas can effectively represent the 1st 2nd and 3rd moments of pe with overall expected relative errors of 1 7 7 8 and 11 2 considering changes in temperature conditions the results show considerably higher impacts of 1 c warming compared to the same magnitude of cooling in ez1 9 decrease vs 5 7 increase and ez2 12 9 decrease vs 11 increase this is different in ez4 where the expected shift in pe due to unit degree cooling is higher than warming 2 5 increase vs 0 9 decrease in panel d the likelihood of pe being larger than the expected pe during historical condition is presented under the three temperature scenarios in ez1 the exceedance probability decreases from 67 5 for 1 c cooling to 34 1 for 1 c warming this alteration is more intense in ez2 where the exceedance probability decreases from 73 9 for 1 c cooling to 15 5 for 1 c warming in ez4 the rate of change is from 63 5 for 1 c cooling to 13 4 for 1 c warming the results clearly show the nonsymmetric response of pe to a unit degree changes in temperature 5 3 regional impact of changing temperature on duration of frozen and thawed periods in spring to showcase how ft characteristics can change spatially due to unique changes in temperature characteristics we implement a bottom up assessment to quantify expected changes in the long term average of fd and td in spring given a range of changes in expected temperature at each ecozone we consider the change in mean temperature at each ecozone from 2 c to 2 c with a sampling step of 0 5 c fig 10 summarizes the results of this analysis in which the left and right panels are related to fd and td respectively each row is related to specific ecozones ordered from north top to south bottom red blue color is the indicator of increasing decreasing changes in the long term average of fd and td at each ecozone considering unique changes in temperature conditions it is clear that the changes in spring s fd due to identical change in regional temperature is considerably higher in northern ecozones while td is more sensitive to changes in expected temperature in southern ecozones due to 2 c cooling warming for instance the increase decrease in the long term average of spring s fd is ranging from 10 8 to 6 5 days in ez1 and ez8 respectively these shifts for td are 4 4 and 10 9 days in ez1 and ez8 for 2 c cooling warming respectively moreover the comparison of changes in expected spring s fd as a result of a unique magnitude of positive and negative changes in average temperature conditions indicates the higher impacts of cooling than warming the average increase in fd over all ecozones due to 2 c cooling temperature conditions is 7 days while due to 2 c warming the average decrease in fd is 6 days similarly looking at changes in expected td the results highlight the higher sensitivity to cooling temperature conditions comparing to the same magnitude of warming over all ecozones on average 2 c cooling warming leads to an average of 7 less 6 more thawed days in spring the higher impacts of cooling is consistent with the results obtained at grid scale in section 5 1 5 4 impacts of changing regional dependencies on mean and variance of frozen area during april as noted in section 4 2 dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics are subject to significant temporal changes in the majority of comparison cases here we investigate how temporal changes in dependence structures can alter the response of ft characteristics to unique changes in temperature conditions to showcase this we quantify the impact of unit degree warming on efa and vfa during april in two distinct time episodes of 1980 1997 and 1998 2016 across québec s ecozones and the province as a whole the results are shown in fig 11 where the top and bottom panels correspond to efa and vfa respectively four colored interquartile ranges are shown for each region except for ez1 where the dependencies are not significant for each region light gray and red show the interquartile ranges corresponding to historical temperature conditions for the periods of 1980 1997 and 1998 2016 respectively in parallel dark gray and red show the impact of 1 c warming during each sub period for each range the corresponding mean ensemble is depicted with black dots and the long term average of ft characteristics during the entire data period is displayed with black lines by looking at the shifts in interquartile ranges and the mean values of both efa and vfa higher alterations are observed during the second period in most regions particularly in southern ecozones as well as the province as a whole over québec for instance the decline in long term average efa due to 1 c warming is 6 6 for 1980 1997 compared to 9 6 for 1998 2016 these shifts are respectively 1 1980 1997 vs 4 1998 2016 for vfa over québec the intensifying impact of 1 c warming on efa during the second period is vividly observed in ez5 where there are shifts of 9 in long term average values over 1998 2016 comparing to only 4 over 1980 1997 for vfa over ez5 decreases of 9 and 2 in expected values are estimated over the second and first half sub periods respectively also by looking at vfa over both time episodes a unit degree warming leads to an increase decrease in interquartile ranges as well as expected values over northern southern ecozones this effect is consistent with the changes in sign of dependence between temperatures vfa over the different region fig 5b the nonstationary in the dependence structure has been reported in some other studies looking at climate variables in canada e g singh and najafi 2020 singh et al 2021 and deserves giving more attention 6 summary and conclusion recurring cycles of ft are among the most important landscape features in cold regions controlling various environmental processes below and above the soil as the dynamics of ft are largely governed by the near surface air temperature warming climate can alter historical characteristics of ft quite substantially and such changes have been already observed across cold regions having said that there are still several rooms for improving our knowledge about the effects of warming climate on ft patterns under current and future conditions first and foremost the current understandings about the alterations in ft patterns and how they relate to the warming climate are mainly built on in situ measurements that are crucial yet sparse and locally relevant second projecting ft characteristics under future conditions is not trivial due to the limitations in available datasets and or process representations in current hydrology and land surface models third it is not yet clear whether changes in the ft characteristics are solely due to changes in temperature conditions or it is due to a more profound change in the relationship between temperature and ft characteristics at the landscape scale to tackle these questions we suggest shifting the focus of ft modeling from continuous descriptions of ft states in time and space to quantifications of statistical properties of ft variables at coarser temporal and spatial scales we accordingly propose using copulas a set of generic multivariate mathematical functions that quantify dependence between random variables to formally account for the link between temperature and ft variables at relevant scales using copulas we can 1 describe the statistical dependence between temperature and ft variables 2 diagnose temporal and spatial variations in the dependence and 3 estimate ft characteristics conditioned to a given change in temperature to showcase the application of the developed modeling framework we consider the province of québec the largest province in canada over the period between 1979 and 2016 we consider pairing a global satellite based ft with a gridded climate datasets and extract a number of ft variables across a range of temporal and spatial scales the results of this study reveal the existence of strong dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics relatively speaking the dependence between temperature and duration of frozen and thawed states are stronger particularly during spring and in april when significant dependencies between temperature and spatial extent of ft are also observed the empirical dependencies that are extracted from the gridded datasets can be reconstructed using the parameterized copulas in general the ranges of simulated dependencies are less for duration based ft characteristics revealing better capability of copula models in representing the empirical dependence between temperature and duration based compared to spatial ft characteristics our findings clearly highlight significant variations in the dependencies across time and space most importantly the magnitudes of dependencies between temperature and duration of ft states increase by moving from north to south and in more recent time episodes 1998 2016 these changes can reveal the role of ecosystem conditions and or climate change in regulating the impact of temperature on ft characteristics using parametrized copula models we show the nonsymmetric response of ft characteristics to temperature change as an example the comparison of the change in expected fd and td in spring under 1 alteration in average temperature indicates the higher impacts of cooling than warming across spatial scales from grid to ecozone to the whole province we also show that a similar magnitude of change causes higher impacts under more recent dependencies particularly in southern ecozones as well as the province as a whole the intensifying impact of temperature change under changing dependence conditions can be vividly seen in hudson plains areas within québec for which the impact of 1 c warming on vfa is up to 4 5 times more under dependencies observed in 1998 2016 compared to 1980 1997 these findings point at a complex and multifaceted nature of climate change impacts on ft conditions caused by both variations in marginal characteristics of temperature as well as joint dependencies between temperature and ft characteristics although this method is applied in québec and using a particular dataset it is globally relevant and can be implemented through pairing other relevant datasets too having said that still several improvements can be made first and foremost although air temperature is the most influencing climate variables on ft characteristics other variables such as snow cover and depth can also influence ft patterns iwata et al 2010 yi et al 2015 including more climate variables require going beyond bivariate copulas and inevitably lead to more computational complexities particularly with respect to conditional modeling but it is a necessary step toward a better understanding of ft patterns under changing conditions second it is not yet clear how much the findings are sensitive to specific datasets from which temperature and ft characteristics along with their joint dependencies are inferred this requires performing systematic sensitivity and intercomparison studies which is an important step towards quantifying uncertainty in our findings in québec and should be also considered in other regions we hope that this study can inspire more efforts towards better understandings of landscape responses in changing cold regions

4166,we use two dimensional numerical models to identify controls on groundwater recharge water table dynamics and the sink source function of fine textured hummocks in water limited environments a silty clay loam hummock with aspen forest cover in the sub humid boreal plains region of canada is used to develop a conceptual model and calibrate a variably saturated flow model to better investigate the dynamics of recharge water table position and lateral flow between the forested hummock and adjacent peatland scenario testing achieved by raising and lowering the hydraulic conductivity by an order of magnitude and altering the hummock height and length provides further understanding of the controls that hydraulic conductivity and hummock morphometry exert on recharge and forestland peatland interactions we find that the hydraulic conductivity of the glacial till has the largest control over recharge followed by the hummock height and length and lastly annual atmospheric fluxes hummocks with higher hydraulic conductivity or long morphometric profiles are most often sinks of water as they promote increased root water uptake while taller hummocks with lower hydraulic conductivity tend to act as hydrologic sources for adjacent wetlands the magnitude of annual recharge and water table elevation are poorly correlated with annual atmospheric fluxes due to the strong effects of multi year storage deficits or surpluses however they are appreciably affected by decadal wet dry cycles typical of the boreal plains climate additionally we show that both distance along a hummock and elevation are key factors in controlling the spatial distribution of recharge at a single hummock it is common to conceptualize the water table as a shallow and subdued replica of surface topography where water flows from topographic highs i e forestlands to topographic lows i e peatlands in humid environments however as we show here recharge rates water table elevation and the sink source function of a forested hummock in water limited environments is highly variable in time and space and strongly dependent on both the hydrogeological and morphometric properties of the hummock keywords recharge groundwater water table forestland peatland interactions sink source function hillslope hydrology 1 introduction the canadian boreal plains are dominated by aspen mixedwood forests shallow lakes and peatlands the intrinsic variability in water storage of these land covers in conjunction with the sub humid climate causes large interannual variability in runoff generation and hydrological connectivity at local to landscape scales small local groundwater flow systems are defined here as systems where the recharge area is above and directly adjacent to its discharge area similar to winter s fundamental hydrologic landscape unit winter 2001 these local groundwater flow systems are necessary to hydrologically link forested hummocks i e small low hills generally under 15 m in height with adjacent peatlands or ponds and subsequently create runoff from the landscape however the development of groundwater mounds beneath hummocks which is required to generate these local groundwater flow systems may be both spatially and temporally infrequent in low relief and low recharge settings like the boreal plains hokanson et al 2020 thus identifying the spatiotemporal controls on groundwater mounding is crucial to understanding the climatic and geological conditions required for landscape connectivity and runoff generation at larger regional scales this insight is becoming increasingly important as water security ecosystem sustainability and environmental quality become the focus of land management reclamation and reconstruction efforts for large parts of north america forestlands are the primary source of landscape scale runoff however in the boreal plains it has been shown that sparsely vegetated coarse glacial outwashes and peatlands are the primary water producing landforms barr et al 2012 devito et al 2017 hokanson et al 2020 smerdon et al 2007 nevertheless large parts of the boreal plains are characterized by fine textured glacial deposits with aspen mixedwood forests thus far the hydrologic function of fine textured i e silts and clays forested hummocks has not been adequately defined for sub humid regions water tables in low relief water limited environments are generally not topographically controlled and therefore local groundwater flow systems are scarce haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 hokanson et al 2019 tóth 1963 rather these systems are recharge controlled meaning water table positions are more dependent on transient recharge events than the gravity driven flow of more stable topographically controlled water tables haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 groundwater recharge an essential process by which a downward flux of water enters groundwater storage healy and scanlon 2010 is controlled by complex interactions between precipitation both timing rate and magnitude evaporation to the atmosphere and transpiration by vegetation interception of precipitation by the canopy soil water retention properties and depth to the water table wang et al 2009 2015 turkeltaub et al 2015 carrera hernández et al 2011 smerdon et al 2008 healy and scanlon 2010 although it is an important component in groundwater systems and is vital to understanding subsurface water movement and availability recharge is difficult to measure and the relative importance of these controlling factors is poorly understood healy and scanlon 2010 using a combination of field observations and numerical modelling this study identifies the role of aspen forested hummocks in the generation or loss of groundwater and hydrologic connectivity to adjacent peatlands by examining the simulated recharge patterns and sink source functions of various hummock regimes in the boreal plains a silty clay loam hummock located in the boreal plains is used to develop and calibrate a numerical model to better understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of recharge water table position and lateral flow between the forestland and adjacent peatland the calibrated model is then used for scenario testing to further understand the controls on recharge and forestland peatland interactions specifically we test the effects of altering the height length and hydraulic conductivity of the forested hummock under both wet and dry climatic periods 1 1 motivation numerous forested hummocks have been monitored since 2000 as part of the larger ursa long term observation network devito et al 2016 the hummocks are dominated by trembling aspen populus tremuloides and are adjacent to peatlands the peatlands have fairly stable water elevations 0 5 m above or below the peat surface thompson et al 2015 hokanson et al 2020 however the hummocks exhibit very different water table configurations all of the monitored hummocks at ursa are located in the same 100 km2 region so are subject to the similar annual weather patterns e g p pet nevertheless through the various studies conducted at ursa it is evident that no simple metric annual p multi year cumulative p pet saturated hydraulic conductivity etc is a good predictor for water table elevation or potential mounding within the hummocks hummocks with similar storage potential i e height of hummock above the adjacent peatland may have very different water table behavior over time devito unpublished data hokanson et al 2020 for example two hummocks with similar textures will exhibit extremely different water table patterns where one might exhibit groundwater mounding above the adjacent peatland every year and the other might only wet up once or twice over twenty years consistent groundwater mounding i e the generation of groundwater via recharge and subsequent flow away from the hummock is required for hummocks to act as a hydrologic sources of water and while it is often assumed that local topographic highs like hummocks act as sources of water to the larger landscape it has been shown that this is not the case for many hummocks in the boreal plains hokanson et al 2020 an instrumented hummock was selected to develop and calibrate a variably saturated two dimensional numerical model to simulate observed water table behavior and concomitant recharge rates this particular study hummock was part of a larger modelling effort by thompson et al 2015 thompson et al 2017 thompson et al 2018 who examined the hydrological effects of climate and aspen harvesting however while thompson et al focused on peatland pond and riparian hydrologic dynamics here we focus on the groundwater hydrology of the mineral hummock itself this work uses a numerical model to examine the controls hummock morphometry hydraulic conductivity and annual atmospheric fluxes over recharge water table position and forestland peatland hydrologic interactions in fine textured sub humid glacial environments 2 study area the utikuma region study area ursa 56 n 115 w is located 370 km north of edmonton alberta in the boreal plains ecozone of

et al 2009 the primary modes of precipitation i e 50 60 are short duration convective cell storms which occur during the summer months when evapotranspiration is highest devito et al 2005 brown et al 2014 previous research at ursa has included several multi year ecohydrological and hydrogeological studies devito et al 2016 previous work by smerdon et al 2005 smerdon et al 2008 and carrera hernández et al 2011 focused on water table and recharge dynamics in coarse textured materials in the boreal plain this study focuses on water table and recharge dynamics in the fine textured hummocky moraine regions of ursa these glacial landforms are characterized by silty clay loam hummocks underlain by clays and clay tills where shallow i e 1 15 m below the surface mineral hydraulic conductivity ranges from 1 10 9 to 1 10 6 m s hokanson et al 2019 thompson et al 2015 2 1 study hummock site field measurements the study hummock is in the catchment of pond 40 at ursa petrone et al 2016 thompson et al 2015 and is part of a pond peatland forested hummock complex fig 1b pond 40 and its catchment are located on a regional high which functions as a regional recharge zone with strong vertical gradients ferone and devito 2004 hokanson et al 2019 the hummock is separated from pond 40 by a 50 m wide peatland above which the mineral hummock rises approximately 6 m the study hummock and those around it are characterized by gray luvisolic soils soil classification working group 1998 developed from disintegration moraine deposits which are typically silt rich but spatially heterogeneous with zones of high clay or sand content fenton et al 2013 redding and devito 2008 the a soil horizon is typically 0 1 m thick and the b horizon typically only extends 0 5 m to 0 7 m below the ground surface redding and devito 2008 boreholes indicate an extremely heterogeneous glacial landscape with evidence of sand and clay lenses in largely silty clay loam hillslopes hokanson et al 2019 thompson et al 2015 vogwill 1978 the water table elevation in the hillslope was monitored from 2004 to 2018 at three monitoring wells near the crest of the hummock wa mid slope wb and at the toe of the slope wc fig 1c these water levels were recorded both manually i e water level tape and remotely i e pressure transducers with dataloggers solinst hydraulic conductivity of the glacial substrate and upper soil layers were estimated using slug tests and a guelph permeameter respectively these data have been reported previously redding and devito 2011 thompson et al 2015 thompson et al 2018 the pond 40 catchment was clear cut during the winters of 2007 north side of lake 40 and 2008 south side of pond 40 thompson et al 2018 studied the hydrological impacts of this harvest and compared them with an adjacent reference catchment they found that aspen harvesting had limited impacts on groundwater levels beyond the initial post harvest years due to the rapid recovery of aspen evapotranspiration and high soil moisture storage capacity of the native glacial materials thompson et al 2018 depending on the seasonal and interannual climatic conditions the water table exhibits periods with groundwater mounds i e the water table is above the adjacent peatland and periods with groundwater depressions i e the water table is below the adjacent peatland the water table elevation near the top of the hummock wa fig 1c ranges from approximately 1 5 m below the adjacent peatland to more than 3 m above the peatland while the water table in the peatland varies less than 0 5 m in a given year and remains within 0 5 m above or below the peat surface thompson et al 2015 daily p data were collected from 1999 to 2018 at ursa using two to three tipping bucket rain gauges adapted for snowfall by using anti freeze reservoirs historic daily p was taken from the fort mcmurray cs weather station wmo 71585 56 65 n 111 21 w from 1944 to 1999 and at the fort mcmurray weather station wmo 2581 56 73 n 111 38 w from 1920 to 1943 the closest maintained weather stations to ursa with the most continuous data environment canada 2019 daily average temperature from 1921 to 2018 was also obtained from the fort mcmurray weather stations environment canada 2019 precipitation expressed as cumulative departure from the long term mean annual p cdm is used in some analyses the cdm was calculated by a creating a daily time series of annual p a moving sum of daily p with a backward window of 365 days b subtracting the long term annual mean p 444 mm from the moving sum of annual precipitation values resulting in a daily time series of moving window one year departures from the mean cdm 1 and c accumulating the resulting departures over a period of either two or three years cdm 2 cdm 3 this approach of moving window cumulative departures has the advantage of showing both long term cumulative trends in moisture deficit or surplus as well as short term effects such as large melt or storm events smail et al 2019 3 numerical modelling and statistical methods 3 1 general approach the surficial geology at the study site is highly heterogeneous however the model was constructed as a simplified representation with homogeneous layers to capture the essential hydraulic characteristics and behavior of the system yet still be applicable to a range of hummock scenarios this generalization inevitably reduces the accuracy of the transient heads predicted by the model however and more importantly it allows for the model to later be applied to different hummock morphometries without being limited by idiosyncratic site specific features such as a buried sand lens a two dimensional profile from the hillslope crest to the peatland was chosen to represent the system fig 1b and 1c this domain is consistent with the conceptual flow field where lateral flow is from the crest of the hummock to the peatland or vice versa observed water table elevations along the primary study hummock are used to calibrate the model which represents the integrated responses to recharge rates root water uptake and lateral fluxes between the peatland and hummock the calibrated model is then modified for scenario testing to represent other hummock regimes namely by increasing or decreasing the available storage vertically and laterally away from the peatland i e hummock height and length and changing the transmission properties of the hummock substrate i e hydraulic conductivity this approach allows for the identification of the major controls or thresholds governing water table behavior recharge and the development of local groundwater flow systems 3 2 transient variably saturated model due to the sub humid nature of the boreal plain region p et is close to unity meaning small changes in either p or et have large effects on infiltration vadose zone storage root water uptake and ultimately recharge variably saturated conditions are therefore fundamental to understanding the entire system to simulate both saturated and unsaturated conditions transient two dimensional simulations were carried out in hydrus 2d which is a finite element model for simulating the movement of water in variably saturated media by solving the richard s equation with a sink term for root water uptake version 2 05 šimůnek et al 2006 the soil water retention curve and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function were modelled using the van genuchten mualem constitutive relationships mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 3 2 1 model domain and material properties the model domain extends laterally from the middle of the peatland to the crest of the hummock and vertically from the crest of the hill to 26 m depth fig 1c the finite element mesh was discretized such that the upper layers have vertical and horizontal nodal spacing of approximately 0 15 m and 0 45 m respectively the nodal spacing gradually increases with depth so that the lowest part of the domain has vertical and horizontal nodal spacing of approximately 0 8 m and 4 m respectively four primary hydrogeologic units were included in the model peat forest floor soil and glacial till table 1 fig 1c the peatland is represented by two model materials a less dense fibric peat and a denser sapric peat fibric peat is found at the surface and is least decomposed and least dense and sapric peat is found at the bottom and margins of peatlands and is more decomposed and denser the soil horizons are represented by two model layers a forest floor layer representing the lfh litter fibric humic materials and a soil layer representing the a and b horizons the c horizon and underlying glacial till are simplified to a single extensive glacial till unit which has the same soil hydraulic parameters but is discretized into 3 layers upper mid and lower till where the saturated hydraulic conductivity decreases with depth table 1 the soil hydraulic properties of the forest floor soil and glacial till were informed by field measurements and previous modeling efforts redding and devito 2008 2011 thompson et al 2015 thompson et al 2018 before being calibrated an anisotropy ratio kx kz of 30 1 which represents one and a half orders of magnitude contrast was applied for all materials except the peat which had an anisotropy ratio of 10 1 and the forest floor which was isotropic due to the impact they have on recharge the soil hydraulic properties for the forest floor and soil layers were calibrated using a separate but complementary 1d modelling approach utilizing measured soil water content over two winter summer cycles see appendix a for further details on the 1d model construction and calibration when calibrating the 2d model to best simulate water table dynamics along the study hummock the glacial till soil hydraulic properties i e hydraulic conductivity van genuchten alpha and n parameters porosity were adjusted manually in an iterative trial and error approach 3 2 2 boundary and initial conditions the upper surface of the model represents the aspen forestland the peatland and the transition between the two fig 1c net p consisting of daily fluxes of throughfall i e rain not intercepted by vegetation and snow melt after sublimation and root water uptake were applied to the surface of the model composed of the aspen forestland and the narrow peatland forestland transition and peatland margin represented here by sapric peat daily p was considered rain on days with average air temperature greater than 0 c it was then applied directly to the surface of the model after accounting for interception otherwise it was considered snow and accumulated on the surface to determine snowmelt a simple degree day melting model was applied nrcs 2004a nrcs 2004b evaporation was removed from the daily precipitation externally from the model in the forms of rain interception and snow sublimation free water evaporation from the soil surface was assumed to be negligible blanken et al 2001 and therefore not considered a constant daily canopy interception of 0 5 mm in the spring and 2 mm following full leaf out was applied to the daily rain data thompson et al 2015 and 13 of snow water equivalent was removed from melting snow to account for snow sublimation pomeroy et al 1998 daily pet was determined using the hamon 1963 method daily potential transpiration tp was partitioned from daily pet using the leaf area index lai of the hummock vegetation via the beer lambert law ritchie 1972 the initiation of leaf emergence and time until the full leaf period was determined by the cumulative degree day d method where leaf emergence begins when the sum of d exceeds 69 days prior to which lai is zero a fully leafed canopy during which lai is 4 5 and incorporates the aspen canopy and shrub subcanopy little devito unpublished data is assumed when the sum of d reaches 316 days barr et al 2004 between leaf emergence and full leaf out lai increased linearly the senescence of boreal aspen has been found to be primarily controlled by decreased daylight hours therefore the initiation and completion of leaf senescence was set to the same day of year in the hydrologic year starting november 1 226 and 259 respectively for every year barr et al 2004 sutton and price 2020 to simulate the limited effects of aspen harvesting tp was reduced to 0 7 tp for the first post harvest year and returned to full tp by the 7th post harvest year consistent with thompson et al 2018 previous studies have shown that fine shallow lateral roots primarily exploit resources water and nutrients while deep large diameter roots are responsible for structural stability block et al 2006 strong and roi 1983 snedden 2013 found that along a hillslope at the ursa aspen root mass was most concentrated in the top 0 2 0 3 m of the soil profile root water uptake was therefore concentrated in the upper 0 3 m of the hillslope in the model domain the peatland was represented by a constant pressure head boundary ψ 0 3 m which represents a stable water table 0 3 m below the surface of the peatland middle the implications of this are explored in the sensitivity analysis a constant head boundary h 662 m asl ψ 11 m was applied to the base of the model to simulate connection with the deeper regional groundwater flow system this implementation is supported by deep piezometers in the area which show little to no seasonal or inter annual variability in hydraulic head hokanson et al 2019 thompson et al 2015 this lower boundary condition resulted in a downward head gradient of 0 4 similar to the vertical gradients reported by hokanson et al 2019 for the same catchment no flow boundary conditions were applied to the lateral edges of the domain representative initial conditions were obtained by allowing the model to spin up from hydrostatic conditions using observed climate data for the ten years prior to the period of interest ten years was deemed more than sufficient as any period greater than 5 years resulted in equivalent model results 3 3 scenario testing 3 3 1 hummock regimes once calibrated the model domain was modified to represent a spectrum of forested hummock regimes with differing combinations of hydraulic conductivity hummock height and hummock length the topography of the study hummock was simplified and adjusted to represent these hummock morphometries the ground surface elevation z leading away from the peatland was represented by a sine function z a sin e b x where x is the distance into the hillslope away from the peatland a is the vertical distance from the peatland to the top of the hummock i e hummock height b controls the distance from the peatland edge to the hummock crest i e hummock length and e controls the concavity to focus on the controls of hummock morphometry on water table position and recharge e was held constant at a value of 2 hummock height a was to set to 2 6 and 10 m and b was to set to 0 0118 0 018 and 0 038 hummock lengths of approximately 45 85 and 135 m respectively for a total of 9 different hummock morphometry combinations fig 2 of these nine morphometric scenarios a through i hummock e most closely resembles the morphometry of the study hummock used to calibrate the numerical model fig 1c three hydraulic conductivity k scenarios were tested by varying the base k in the glacial till units base k the same conductivities as the study hummock table 1 high k k values increased by an order of magnitude and low k k values decreased by an order of magnitude the combinations of the three heights three lengths and three conductivity scenarios result in 27 unique hummock regimes these parameters were chosen to approximate the range of hummock characteristics morphometry and hydraulic conductivity observed in the field across the glaciated western boreal plains hokanson et al 2020 simulations were run from 1930 to 2018 after a ten year spin up period 1920 1930 and did not include a reduction in tp due to harvesting 3 3 2 sink source dynamics the long term sink or source function for each hummock regime was assessed by examining the water fluxes to and from the adjacent peatland if by the end of the 88 year simulation period more than 90 m3 m i e approximately 1 m3 m yr of water was sourced to the peatland from the hummock or to the hummock from the peatland it was deemed a long term source or sink of water respectively if the function switched or fluctuated or was otherwise very small throughout the simulation and therefore the end net value was less than 90 m3 m in either direction it was deemed a weak sink source in this 2d representation of a 3d hillslope 1 m3 m represents 1 m3 flowing across the peatland forestland interface per meter along the interface 3 3 3 relative controls on groundwater recharge the simulated annual recharge rates 88 years for each of 27 regimes n 2376 were then used to train a boosted regression tree brt ensemble to evaluate the relative importance of the morphometric hydrogeological and climatic controls on the model results brts create hundreds to thousands of regression trees in this case predicting groundwater recharge which are produced forward and stage wise by re weighting residuals from previous trees the final brt model is a linear combination of all the created trees that can be conceptualized as a regression model where each term is a tree elith et al 2008 from which we can estimate each predictor variable s importance by averaging the relative importance or influence of the variables over the collection of trees de ath 2007 brts are valuable because they do not assume normality or stationarity they ignore non informative predictors can accept both numeric and categorical predictors are unaffected by outliers are not prone to overfitting due to correlated or redundant predictors and are efficient at modelling non linear relationships de ath 2007 dormann et al 2013 elith et al 2008 not only do brts build predictive regression models they can provide insight to the relative importance of each predictor variable which are used here to determine which hummock scale parameters influence recharge the most although brts are a relatively new machine learning method they have been successfully applied in previous hydrogeological studies such as developing frameworks for groundwater nitrate models nolan et al 2015 aquifer salinity knierim et al 2020 groundwater spring mapping chen et al 2020 and examining the relative controls of climate and geology on basin water yield sun et al 2019 the brt analysis here was performed in matlab using the machine learning toolbox where a ten fold cross validation process was used to evaluate the performance of the brt model and to prevent overfitting babyak 2004 kohavi 1995 the hyperparameters of the brt e g leaf size number of trees were optimized to improve the accuracy and further prevent the overfitting of the developed brt model similar to that of lou et al 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance 4 1 1 comparing observed and simulated water table elevations simulated transient water table elevations were compared with measured water table elevations at three monitoring wells along the study hummock hillslope wa n 2277 wb n 111 and wc n 87 fig 3 for wa only the continuous data set which was resampled at a daily time step was used for calibration considering all synchronous water table observations and model predictions n 2475 89 of observations were within 1 m of simulated values and 73 of observations were within 0 5 m because we greatly simplified the hydrogeology of the hummock perfectly modelling the minutia of water table dynamics at specific points in the heterogeneous subsurface was never an expectation nevertheless by visually examining the transient simulation results it appears that the model is adequately representing the basic hydrologic functions of the hummock in general the characteristics of the water table hydrographs e g peaks rising limb and recession in the hillslope were well represented by the model fig 3 seasonal and interannual trends were also well represented by the model in most years winter periods show a gradual increase in water table elevation in the modelled data that is absent in the observed data this is an expected artefact of the numerical model since hydrus does not simulate ice or frozen groundwater in the peatland or riparian zones which may lead to increased lateral subsurface flow from the peatland to the hillslope during winter periods the timing of the spring water table rise which is the result of snowmelt infiltration is for the most part accurate however for some years it is early by several weeks and is a limitation of the simplistic degree day melting approach implemented here the rate of melt and therefore potential recharge is dependent on snowpack size and density which can delay melt bartlett et al 2006 the observed water table elevations at the wa monitoring well were considerably lower in the first three years of observational data 2006 2007 and 2008 when compared to the remainder of the time series 2009 to 2019 this discrepancy may be due to several factors for example the monitoring well at wa installed in 2006 had not reached equilibrium with the surrounding fine textured substrate or as redding and devito 2008 noted periodic freeze melt cycles can result in concrete frost which inhibits virtually all snowmelt infiltration alternatively a buried lens of contrasting material could have a threshold effect on water table response which was not explored here 4 1 2 sensitivity analysis this model builds on the work of thompson et al 2015 thompson et al 2018 which contains a detailed sensitivity analysis and emphasizes the role of the pond and peatland this work however focuses on the water table position in the mineral hummock consequently the sensitivity analysis reflects these different objectives changing the lower boundary condition peatland hydraulic conductivity and the range between saturated and residual water content of the till was found to have minimal impacts on the model results changing the soil thickness increase resulted in a decrease in recharge the anisotropy ratio increase resulted in lower water tables and the till unsaturated flow parameters had disproportionate effects at the upper slope of the hummock wa where the vadose zone is thickest compared to the mid slope wb and toe of slope wc regions however changing the elevation of the fixed water table in the peatland decrease resulted in lower water tables had a stronger effect on the water table position in the lower portions of the hummock and a negligible effect in the upper slope the detailed sensitivity analysis can be found in appendix b 4 2 hummock water balance during the 88 year simulation the dominant annual fluxes in the hummock water budget were p and evapotranspiration the sum of evaporation composed of interception and sublimation and root water uptake which had annual mean values of 443 and 385 mm yr respectively over the entire modelling period annual precipitation snowmelt recharge and cdm 1 cdm 2 and cdm 3 for the modelling period are shown in fig 4 all major budget components are plotted in fig 5 for a ten year period hydrologic years 1961 to 1970 which contains some of the highest 186 mm 1970 and lowest 35 mm 1965 recharge rates p is partitioned into evaporation infiltration and runoff fig 5b the latter of which is the residual of p evaporation and infiltration for the entirety of the model run there was little to no surface runoff at the top of the hillslope however during spring melt and high intensity summer storms there was intermittent runoff at the toe of the slope which on an annual basis had a median value of 18 mm yr and is most correlated with precipitation that occurred prior to full leaf out of the aspen r2 0 61 while most years had relatively low runoff values only during especially wet periods i e precipitation prior to full leaf out exceeds 230 mm annual runoff exceeded 85 mm yr large runoff events have been recorded in aspen dominated catchments in the boreal plains but are infrequent and may only occur every 10 to 20 years devito et al 2005 the cumulative change in storage became relatively large i e 75 150 mm in april or may of each year but by the end of the hydrologic year was starting to decline fig 5b however most years ended with an appreciable storage surplus or deficit when compared to the average long term storage in the hummock the maximum end of year storage deficit was 84 mm and the maximum end of year storage surplus was 83 mm fig 6 a the middle 68 i e one standard deviation of the end of year storage difference ranged from 40 mm to 40 mm this indicates that the system does not reset itself each year and there are opportunities for multi year impacts on water levels or recharge that is when the change in storage does not return to zero it may have a disproportionate effect on the next year s recharge as a product of precipitation such behaviour is contrary to the very common assumption that the annual change in storage is zero which can lead to either under or overestimation of other parameters in a water balance study han et al 2020 devito et al 2005 4 2 1 water table elevations and peatland forestland fluxes the hydrographs for all three wells showed seasonal peaks and associated recessions in response to annual spring melt however the hydrographs at wb and wc had earlier peaks and quicker recessions than those at wa a time series of the simulated water table elevations at the three monitoring wells for a selected five year period 1960 1965 are shown in fig 7 b the water table exhibited a similar pattern on an annual basis where the annual spring melt usually in mid april would cause the water table to rise and the subsequent onset of transpiration from the aspen forest land would both retard recharge and draw down the water table reaching a minimum elevation in the late summer or early fall throughout the simulation the water table elevation at the top of the hummock wa was more dynamic than at the mid slope wb and toe of slope wc positions however the water table lower on the hummock were deeper and lower than the peatland for longer durations water table configurations representing the 5 50 95 and 99 percentile ranks are shown with empirical cumulative distribution functions for water table elevations for each well in fig 7a while the trends in the hydrographs were the same along the hillslope the timings were not in sync at the toe and mid slope locations wc and wb respectively the hydrographs would peak and start to decline much earlier than at the crest of the hummock wa water table behaviour of this kind is controlled by the thickness of the unsaturated zone above the water table only the 90th and 95th percentiles cases c and d in fig 7a have water tables that truly follow topography the 5th and 50th percentiles cases a and b in fig 7a show a water table extending from the peatland laterally into the hummock where at the toe and mid slope there is a notable depression for large parts of the year this water table depression is caused by groundwater upflux i e upward flow of water away from the water table into the unsaturated zone due to root water uptake i e transpiration which in turn generates a gradient for groundwater to flow into the depression from the peatland and later in year from upslope near wa fig 7b fluxes of water between the peatland and the forested hummock are transient and vary from year to year and are dependent on water table elevations at the toe of the slope fig 5b and 7b on a daily basis the directions of the flow of water between the peatland and hummock was almost evenly split where the direction of flow was towards the hummock approximately 49 of the time however especially during spring snow melt the magnitude of the fluxes was larger when flow was from the hummock to the peatland and on an annual basis the median peatland flux was 13 mm away from the hummock 4 2 2 groundwater recharge daily recharge was calculated at each location along the hummock i e wa wb wc and was either positive to represent downward flow of water that intersects the water table or negative to represent upflux usually due to root water uptake and redistribution under capillary action fig 5a the spatial distribution of recharge patterns along the hillslope was generally organized into the classic tóthian unit basin tóth 1962 where at the top of the hummock wa there was generally positive recharge throughout the year and at the bottom of the hummock wc there was predominantly upflux this upflux was usually due to root water uptake however when water tables at the mid and toe of the slope were especially high e g hydrologic years 1961 and 1970 in fig 5a wc acted as a groundwater discharge zone and upflux through the land surface was the result the mid slope wb showed greater temporal variability than either wa or wc with recharge dominating in the snow melt season and upflux dominating once transpiration began during leaf out of the aspen forest during most years wa received the most recharge followed by wb and wc this is due to the depth of the water table below the ground surface and the thickness of the unsaturated zone where percolating water has the greatest probability of escaping the rooting zone before it can transpire cross correlation analyses indicate that there is an average 26 day lag time between daily p and recharge at wa whereas the lag times for wb and wc average only 1 day total precipitation applied to the forested hummock which is a combination of throughfall and snow melt after sublimation ranged from 187 to 605 mm yr while recharge at the crest of the hummock wa ranged from only 15 mm to 200 mm fig 4a notably there was no strong correlation between annual recharge and annual precipitation r2 0 16 annual snowmelt r2 0 28 or p pet r2 0 15 however there was a stronger relationship between annual recharge and the sum of the previous two years total precipitation r2 0 48 and the two year departure from the long term mean cdm 2 r2 0 56 this is mostly likely a consequence of the control exerted by the state of the hummock storage i e deficit or surplus at the end of the previous year if a hydrologic year begins under storage deficit conditions a the water table itself is likely lower and transit times through the vadose zone will be longer b the low soil moisture in the vadose zone reduces the effective hydraulic conductivity and c increased available storage must be filled before recharge can commence han et al 2008 wossenyeleh et al 2020 fig 6b shows the relationship between recharge and the storage state at the beginning of the hydrologic year i e at the end of the previous hydrologic year this relationship makes it clear that the previous hydrologic year has a dominant influence on the current year s recharge rate regardless of current atmospheric fluxes 4 3 scenario testing water table elevation and groundwater recharge the 27 hummock regimes presented here test the effects of hummock morphometry height and length and hydraulic conductivity on water table elevation and recharge the general water table behaviour fluctuations frequency of groundwater mounding and recharge rates were evaluated for each scenario and were measured at the top of each respective hummock similar to wa observation point at the study hummock previous studies have focused on plot scale controls on recharge such as van genuchten parameters α and n rooting depth and depth of forest floor material e g lukenbach et al 2019 wang et al 2009 naylor et al 2016 or on regional scale controls such as climate topography and geology healy and scanlon 2010 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 however there is a noticeable lack of studies that examine the hierarchy of controls over water table configurations and recharge at the hillslope or hummock scale and how variations therein affect regional hydrology appels et al 2015 de vries and simmers 2002 hillslopes are nonetheless the building blocks and fundamental units of larger scale hydrologic systems winter 2001 they serve as local topographic highs and are a key scale for the generation and determination of local groundwater flow and discharge patterns systems and therefore all groundwater flow accumulation for intermediate scale systems when comparing the annual recharge rates to either previous studies in the same region or to other regions in the world it is important to note that the recharge rates reported here are for the top of the hummock in a similar position to wa in the study hummock fig 1c water that infiltrates at the top of the hummock has the highest probability of escaping the aspen rooting zone and becoming recharge and therefore represents the upper limits of groundwater recharge for a given hummock furthermore to avoid ambiguity the words short and tall are reserved for describing hummock height while narrow and long are reserved for describing hummock length 4 3 1 effects of hydraulic conductivity within a single hummock morphometric scenario i e hummocks a i fig 2 lower k conditions i e decreasing the k of the glacial till by a factor of 10 generally acted to increase the elevation and the flashiness or seasonal variability of the water table fig 8 in the smaller hummocks short and narrow e g hummock g low k conditions delayed the hydrograph peak most years and generally depressed the water table additionally in the smaller hummocks during years with lower than average snowmelt the late spring hydrograph peak was very muted as the annual melt was held in storage and subsequently removed from the domain by root water uptake during years with average or greater spring snow melt the hydrograph peaks were similar in magnitude between the low and base k conditions conversely in the large hummocks tall and long e g hummock c low k conditions resulted in consistently higher water tables low k conditions also appeared to amplify interannual patterns e g the dry period from 1940 to 1955 where there are prolonged periods of low or high water tables due to climatic conditions discussed below between hummocks the effects of changing k were more amplified in larger hummocks high k conditions i e increasing the k of the glacial till by a factor of 10 had similar effects in all hummocks where the general elevations of the water tables were lowered seasonal fluctuations were amplified and the interannual fluctuations were dampened in all cases the high k scenarios resulted in water tables with elevations similar to that of the peatland this is due to increased root water uptake and increased lateral distribution of water within the hummock which results in a generally flat water table as the higher k substrates cannot support a steep gradient over such a short distance for the shorter hummocks i e 2 and 6 m high the longer the hummock was the deeper the water tables were under high k conditions temporarily perched water tables were a frequent phenomena in the low k scenarios fig 8 and resulted from high precipitation events quickly saturating the soil and top of the till while the underlying till remained unsaturated however these conditions only lasted for a few days before the saturated front dispersed through the soil profile or was taken up by the aspen changing the k had dramatic effects on the annual recharge rates for all the hummocks where high k scenarios increased the median annual recharge by an average of 150 and low k conditions decreased the median annual recharge by an average of 70 fig 9 annual recharge rates under low k conditions did not have very much interannual variability however under high k conditions the spread was considerably larger 4 3 2 effects of hummock morphometry the effects of hummock morphometry on both water table elevation and recharge can be seen in figs 8 and 9 respectively hummock height and length have strong synergistic effects where increases in both height and length result in elevated water tables and increased recharge however increasing only one parameter does not cause an increase in either water table elevation or recharge for example an especially tall and narrow hummock hummock a does not have appreciably higher water table elevations compared to a shorter hummock of the same length hummock g increasing the length while keeping the height the same e g from hummock d to f reduces the recharge and promotes groundwater depressions beneath the hummock the increased hummock height and narrow length promote increased flux to and from the peatland and the short lateral distance does not promote the development of high hydraulic gradients so the propensity for groundwater mounding is low conversely the tallest and longest hummock c has the highest recharge rates and most elevated water tables while hummock i which is both short and long has the lowest recharge rates and water tables the variation in recharge between tall and short hummocks and long and narrow hummocks mirrors the spatial variability of recharge along the slope i e distance and elevation from the peatland in the study hummock fig 5a the actual annual recharge rates violin plots in fig 9 had high interannual variability especially under base and high k conditions due to large variability in annual precipitation fig 4 however the ratio of recharge to available net precipitation i e precipitation after interception and sublimation recharge p e showed much less variability between years and allows for more robust comparisons between hummock regimes regardless of annual precipitation conditions box plots in fig 9 when examining only the base k conditions the median recharge p ratios ranged from as low as 0 04 hummock i to as high as 0 42 hummock c which have the longest hummock length tested both absolute and variability in recharge p ratios were higher in the taller hummocks this supports previous findings which show that increasing the unsaturated zone thickness also increases the probability of recharge smerdon et al 2008 who performed 1d models of outwash sands and gravels found a threshold height of 4 m above the water table is required for reliable recharge lukenbach et al 2019 who performed 2d simulations of forest floor material over tailings sand in a reclaimed mining landscape found a similar threshold of only 2 m above the water table additionally we show that both distance and elevation along a hummock are key factors in controlling recharge in these water limited environments fig 5a and 9 therefore the common practice in saturated groundwater flow modelling of applying a uniform recharge rate across similar land units could result in gross over or underestimations of actual recharge through space in small or mesoscale models systems although only the effects of hummock length and height were explicitly tested here there is an opportunity to examine the effects of topography on potential recharge the study hummock has a subtly undulating ground surface topography fig 1c and when this surface was simplified by smoothing this undulation was removed the hummock scenario that most closely resembles the study hummock is hummock e fig 2 under the same geologic and atmospheric conditions the study hummock had a median annual recharge rate of 89 mm yr 45 mm standard deviation and hummock e hummock only had a median annual recharge rate of 57 mm yr 13 mm hummock e had both significantly less recharge p 0 001 and much less interannual variability the variation in ground surface elevation in the study hummock creates a depression that allows for focused recharge before it leaves the system as runoff these various forms of relief on a single hillslope in the form of both microtopography and mesotopography e g on the scales of centimeters and tens of meters respectively have been shown to focus infiltration and enhance recharge appels et al 2015 2017 le and kumar 2014 thompson et al 2010 4 3 3 effects of climate across all 27 hummock regimes there were notable temporal patterns in water table elevations regardless of morphometry or conductivity that are attributed to interannual precipitation patterns fig 4a and 8 notably there were extended periods with lower than normal water tables e g from about 1940 to 1950 and from about 1998 to 2005 and higher than normal water tables e g from about 1955 to 1965 and from about 1975 to 1980 present in each hummock regime these wet and dry periods align very well with the cdm 2 and cdm 3 precipitation indices however on an annual basis e g annual p or cdm 1 there is little correlation in most cases for example in 2000 the simulated recharge total at the study hummock was 41 mm fig 4 which represents the 16th percentile of annual recharge and the water table elevations were far below average however the annual p was 442 mm which would be considered an average year i e long term mean annual p is 444 mm fig 4 while the cdm 1 was essentially zero for that year the cdm 2 and cdm 3 were approximately 80 mm and 250 mm respectively this further highlights the role that multi year storage deficits or surpluses play in modulating annual atmospheric fluxes these multi year water deficits and surpluses have large implications for both land management and research approaches common time scales for site investigations environmental assessments or even scientific research efforts are on the order of one to several years however climate cycles in the boreal plains are on the order of 15 years fig 4a mwale et al 2009 consequently results and implications from any site investigation must be put into a long term climatic context through understanding of relationships and processes such as those developed here 4 4 sink source function of hummocks a conductivity paradox the sink source relationship between the forested hummock and adjacent peatland is dependent not on the magnitude of recharge but on the water table position within the hummock which drives lateral hydraulic gradients between the land units fig 8 the long term hydrologic function i e sink or source to the adjacent peatland was affected by all three tested parameters i e hummock length height and hydraulic conductivity by varying degrees hydraulic conductivity had the greatest effect whereby in all but the largest hummock c high k conditions resulted in the hummock being a long term sink moreover hummock c alternated between being a sink and a source depending on climatic conditions and was therefore classified as a weak sink source although dramatically increased recharge may be present under the high k scenarios fig 9 the increased k also allows for increased lateral redistribution of water within the hummock and permits more water to be available for root water uptake by the aspen forest it is also important to note that the k values presented here do not represent the full range of k present in the glaciated boreal plains region of canada but a range of k representative of fine textured moraine deposits the paradox of relatively increased k conditions e g kz 1 10 7 m s resulting in a hummock with elevated recharge rates while also acting as a hydrologic sink would not arise under high k conditions e g kz 1 10 4 m s in a sand hummock the latter would have especially high recharge rates while also acting as a hydrologic source because water would percolate quickly to a low water table below the rooting zone and flow laterally to adjacent land units hummock height had less control over the sink source function of the hummock by which hummocks of similar length but varying height had similar sink source functions based on hydraulic conductivity regardless of height e g hummocks a d g fig 9 interestingly while the longest hummocks f and i were sinks in all cases the longest and tallest hummock c was either a long term source low and base k or weak sink source high k the longer the hummock the larger and or more persistent the groundwater depression caused by root water uptake similar to that shown in fig 7a can become resulting in a long term sink of water from the landscape this phenomenon has also been observed in the prairie pothole region between wetlands and adjacent uplands rosenberry and winter 1997 however at some threshold height e g 10 m above the peatland hummock c a sustained gradient provides a consistent source of water to neighboring land units it is common to conceptualize the water table as a subdued replica of surface topography where water flows from topographic highs to topographic lows this concept is also widely applied to peatland hydrology where the assumption of peatlands being fed water by adjacent forestlands through topography driven flow is ubiquitous hokanson et al 2020 however as we show here the sink source function of a hummock in a sub humid landscape is highly sensitive to both hydrogeological properties and hummock morphometry the sink source function of a land unit and it s proclivity to change through time is crucial to understanding the regional water balance both now and in the future in water limited environments it has been shown at the basin scale that peatlands and forestlands have important but competing roles in influencing surface and subsurface hydrological systems both through empirical observations devito et al 2017 and numerical models hwang et al 2018 boreal plains peatlands despite existing in a water deficit environment have lower actual evapotranspiration rates than forestlands barker et al 2009 devito et al 2005 2017 petrone et al 2007 prepas et al 2006 which when coupled with the internal water conserving feedback mechanisms typical of boreal peatlands waddington et al 2015 makes them primary water sources to the larger landscape in the boreal plains forested hummocks which at the basin scale average don t provide as much water as peatlands may be important at the local scale future work is needed to explore the thresholds and implications that various landscape topologies and topographies may have on intermediate and regional groundwater and surface water systems 4 5 controls on groundwater recharge the modelled annual recharge rates from each hummock regime over the 88 year simulation were used to train a boosted regression tree brt to examine and rank the relative importance of each of the tested hummock parameters hummock height hummock length and glacial till hydraulic conductivity as well as several annual climatic variables potential evapotranspiration pet total precipitation prior to full leaf out throughfall and snowmelt the overall performance of the final trained and fitted brt model can be seen in fig 10 a which had an rmse of 17 mm and an r squared of 0 96 there was no pronounced under or overestimation of annual recharge and the model performed well over the range of hummock regimes tested here the relative predictor importance can be seen in fig 10b where it is clear that in fine textured landscapes hydrogeologic and morphometric factors exerted far more influence than annual climatic variables the hydraulic conductivity had by far the greatest effect on annual recharge followed by hummock height and length which had equal importance these patterns are evident but not entirely obvious in fig 9 where the greatest disparity in annual recharge can be seen between k scenarios and that hummock height and length appear to have a synergistic effect of the climatic variables snow melt was most important followed by throughfall these results confirm observations from several empirical and modeling studies from the same region which showed that surficial geology had a larger control over hydrological responses than climate or topography hokanson et al 2019 and that annual recharge is mostly sourced from spring melt smerdon et al 2008 thompson et al 2015 the brt machine learning method was used here to explore the relative importance of each hydrogeological and climatic variable however it s successful implementation and high prediction confidence makes it clear that it has the potential to be a valuable tool in predicting hydrological responses to highly non linear and interdependent processes in complex landscapes such as the boreal plains when looking at the timing of the hydrographs from the top of both the study hummock and the various hummock regimes figs 3 7b 8 as well as the cumulative recharge along the study hummock fig 5a it is surprising that snowmelt or precipitation prior to full leaf out did not have significantly higher estimated importance when compared to throughfall this is likely because while the timing of the annual hydrograph indicates recharge sourced from spring snow melt there is a low correlation between the actual magnitude of recharge and the magnitude of the spring melt due to the effects of antecedent storage deficits or surpluses fig 6b 5 summary conclusions the controls on the spatiotemporal variability of water table elevation recharge and the sink source function of fine textured forested hummocks in low releif low recharge environments were explored using a two dimensional variably saturated flow model in addition to a site specific model which was created to simulate a study hummock in the boreal plains region of canada with over 13 years of collected hydrogeologic observations 27 generic model domains were created to represent a range of hummock morphometries and hydraulic conductivities we found that between hummocks geology and morphometry had a greater control over recharge rates than annual atmospheric fluxes specifically high conductivity values and larger hummock heights resulted in greatly elevated recharge rates however higher hydraulic conductivity values and longer hummock lengths also allowed for more root water uptake had a greater propensity for water table depressions and resulted in the hummock acting as a hydrologic sink taller hummocks with lower conductivity values tended to act as hydrologic sources within a single hummock regime the magnitude of recharge and water table elevation responses were poorly correlated with annual atmospheric fluxes due to the strong residual effects of storage deficits and surpluses within the hummock however the timing of water table hydrographs both observed and simulated indicate that the bulk of recharge is sourced from spring melt recharge and water table elevation did correlate well with both two and three year cumulative departure from the long term mean annual precipitation this study demonstrates that both recharge rates and the sink source function of fine textured forested hummocks are highly dependent on and sensitive to geology and morphometry of the hummock in heterogeneous glacial landscapes recharge is therefore highly variable in space and time additionally while the magnitude of recharge and water table elevation are less sensitive to annual atmospheric fluxes they are markedly affected by the decadal wet dry cycles typical of the boreal plains climate improving our understanding of the spatial and temporal variation of recharge and water table elevation will promote better management practices and assist in planning for the future the boreal plains are home to ever increasing and unprecedented anthropogenic disturbance in the forms of forestry agriculture oil and gas operations and climate change predicting the local scale hydrologic connections and sink source relationships between land units is necessary to manage and mitigate

2008 to simulate measured volumetric water content vwc at a soil pit located near the wa well on the study hummock fig 2 this modelling was performed to assign appropriate van genuchten mualem soil hydraulic parameters for the forest floor and upper soil layers in the 2d model of the primary text the soil pit was instrumented with five soil water content probes csi model 616 campbell scientific inc logan utah at the following depths 0 05 m lfh forest floor 0 2 m 0 4 m 0 6 m 0 95 m the calibrated van genuchten mualem vgm soil hydraulic parameters were then used in the 2d model for the forest floor and soil layers fig 2 table 1 fig a1 the 1d model was constructed to be 10 m deep and discretized into 0 01 m layers with a constant pressure head lower boundary condition where ψ 4 2 m this translates to a water table ψ 0 positioned 5 8 m below the soil pit which was the highest water table elevation during the instrumented period soil layer thicknesses saturated hydraulic conductivity k saturated soil water content θs bulk density and soil texture sand and clay for the forest floor and soil horizons were explored and quantified by redding 2009 for this and nearby hummocks these values were used both as a starting point and to constrain the calibrated vgm parameters the vgm α and n parameters were initially informed by pedotransfer function values for soils with parameters similar to those reported in redding and devito 2008 for the forest floor and upper soil layers rosetta schaap et al 2001 the vgm parameters were then calibrated to best simulate the observed vwc for each soil layer corresponding to each sensor depth the final calibrated suite of vgm parameters yielded simulated vwc that had an r squared of 0 95 and a root mean square weighted error of 0 0059 when compared to the observed vwc the model was fairly insensitive to the parameters attributed to the till therefore they were not optimized in the 1d modelling exercise and were the focus of the calibration of the 2d model in the main manuscript the final calibrated vgm parameters for the 1d model can be seen in table a1 however in the subsequent 2d model domain the soil layers were generalized and are represented by 2 layers the forest floor 0 1 m thick and the combined a and b horizons 0 6 m thick table a1 appendix b sensitivity analysis of the 2d model this model serves as a natural outgrowth or continuation of the work conducted by thompson et al 2015 thompson et al 2018 which contains a much more detailed sensitivity analysis and has more emphasis on the role of the peatland and atmospheric fluxes i e et and p the scope of this work however is focused on the water table position in the mineral hummock the subsequent sensitivity analysis therefore reflects this several model parameters and boundary conditions were considered for the sensitivity analysis soil thickness above the glacial till the anisotropy ratio the van genuchten α and n parameters of the till and the peatland water table elevation the results of this analysis can be seen in fig b1 changing the lower boundary condition peatland vgm parameters and the range between saturated and residual water content of the till was found to have minimal impacts on the model results and are therefore not reported here changing the soil thickness the anisotropy ratio and the till unsaturated flow parameters had disproportionate effects at the upper slope of the hummock wa where the vadose zone is thickest compared to the mid slope wb and toe of slope wc regions however changing the elevation of the fixed water table in the peatland had a stronger effect on the water table position in the lower portions of the hummock and had a negligible effect in the upper slope the soil layer which represents the weathered a and b horizons below the forest floor and above the parent material has a large control over groundwater recharge lukenbach et al 2019 naylor et al 2016 the soil layer acts to hold and retard infiltration from precipitation before it percolates to deeper regions beyond the aspen root zone when the soil layer is thick e g it extends to 1 0 m below the model surface groundwater recharge is reduced thereby reducing and delaying the spring peak in the groundwater mound elevation contrastingly reducing the soil thickness e g it extends to 0 3 m below the model surface has the opposite effect where the spring groundwater mound elevation peak is increased by approximately 2 5 m and advanced by approximately 20 days this has been explored thoroughly in lukenbach et al 2019 who found similar results in a reclamation setting anisotropy in the model was adjusted by holding the vertical hydraulic conductivity constant and increasing the horizontal hydraulic conductivity by applying a multiplier for all scenarios the forest floor was kept isotropic as the anisotropy ratio kx kz increased from the base case 30 1 to 100 1 the groundwater mound elevation decreased and seasonal water table fluctuations were dampened as the resistance to lateral flow decreased conversely under isotropic conditions 1 1 groundwater mounding was increased and seasonal water table fluctuations were amplified there were discrepancies in some years in the form of late season precipitation events for example in 2011 2013 and 2016 it is evident that significant mid and late summer precipitation events caused rises in the water table at wa however they were not present in the simulated water tables fig 4a this is most likely due to the presence of dual permeability perhaps in the form of macropore or fracture flow in the till that is not captured in the model if a high enough kz value 5 10 2 m d was used the late season hydrograph peaks could be seen however the overall timing and magnitude of the hydrographs were too early and low respectively fig b1e the van genuchten α and n parameters were therefore calibrated in conjunction with hydraulic conductivity holistically to best represent the system as a whole again as a means of avoiding over parameterizing the model so as to increase it s applicability elsewhere the effects of changing the vgm parameters α and n can be shown in fig b1d and b1e higher values of α and n parameters result in greater groundwater recharge and therefore higher water tables fig b1e consistent with previous findings wang et al 2009 in the model the upper boundary condition in the peatland is a specified pressure head ψ of 0 3 m in other words the water table is fixed at a depth of 0 3 m below the peat surface for this sensitivity analysis the water table elevation was increased to be equal to the peat surface ψ 0 and decreased to depth of 1 m ψ 1 0 m to show the effects that a high and low water table configuration in the peatland would have on the adjacent hillslope the change in peatland water table position had negligible effects on the water table behaviour in the upper slope of the hummock however areas closer to the peatland had more amplified effects fig b1c at the toe of the slope wc adjacent to the peatland margin the decrease in peatland water table position caused a corresponding decrease in the fall hillslope water table of approximately 0 3 0 4 m in the mid slope region the water tables showed lower positions in the fall but the spring peaks area similar within 0 2 m of the base case 
4166,we use two dimensional numerical models to identify controls on groundwater recharge water table dynamics and the sink source function of fine textured hummocks in water limited environments a silty clay loam hummock with aspen forest cover in the sub humid boreal plains region of canada is used to develop a conceptual model and calibrate a variably saturated flow model to better investigate the dynamics of recharge water table position and lateral flow between the forested hummock and adjacent peatland scenario testing achieved by raising and lowering the hydraulic conductivity by an order of magnitude and altering the hummock height and length provides further understanding of the controls that hydraulic conductivity and hummock morphometry exert on recharge and forestland peatland interactions we find that the hydraulic conductivity of the glacial till has the largest control over recharge followed by the hummock height and length and lastly annual atmospheric fluxes hummocks with higher hydraulic conductivity or long morphometric profiles are most often sinks of water as they promote increased root water uptake while taller hummocks with lower hydraulic conductivity tend to act as hydrologic sources for adjacent wetlands the magnitude of annual recharge and water table elevation are poorly correlated with annual atmospheric fluxes due to the strong effects of multi year storage deficits or surpluses however they are appreciably affected by decadal wet dry cycles typical of the boreal plains climate additionally we show that both distance along a hummock and elevation are key factors in controlling the spatial distribution of recharge at a single hummock it is common to conceptualize the water table as a shallow and subdued replica of surface topography where water flows from topographic highs i e forestlands to topographic lows i e peatlands in humid environments however as we show here recharge rates water table elevation and the sink source function of a forested hummock in water limited environments is highly variable in time and space and strongly dependent on both the hydrogeological and morphometric properties of the hummock keywords recharge groundwater water table forestland peatland interactions sink source function hillslope hydrology 1 introduction the canadian boreal plains are dominated by aspen mixedwood forests shallow lakes and peatlands the intrinsic variability in water storage of these land covers in conjunction with the sub humid climate causes large interannual variability in runoff generation and hydrological connectivity at local to landscape scales small local groundwater flow systems are defined here as systems where the recharge area is above and directly adjacent to its discharge area similar to winter s fundamental hydrologic landscape unit winter 2001 these local groundwater flow systems are necessary to hydrologically link forested hummocks i e small low hills generally under 15 m in height with adjacent peatlands or ponds and subsequently create runoff from the landscape however the development of groundwater mounds beneath hummocks which is required to generate these local groundwater flow systems may be both spatially and temporally infrequent in low relief and low recharge settings like the boreal plains hokanson et al 2020 thus identifying the spatiotemporal controls on groundwater mounding is crucial to understanding the climatic and geological conditions required for landscape connectivity and runoff generation at larger regional scales this insight is becoming increasingly important as water security ecosystem sustainability and environmental quality become the focus of land management reclamation and reconstruction efforts for large parts of north america forestlands are the primary source of landscape scale runoff however in the boreal plains it has been shown that sparsely vegetated coarse glacial outwashes and peatlands are the primary water producing landforms barr et al 2012 devito et al 2017 hokanson et al 2020 smerdon et al 2007 nevertheless large parts of the boreal plains are characterized by fine textured glacial deposits with aspen mixedwood forests thus far the hydrologic function of fine textured i e silts and clays forested hummocks has not been adequately defined for sub humid regions water tables in low relief water limited environments are generally not topographically controlled and therefore local groundwater flow systems are scarce haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 hokanson et al 2019 tóth 1963 rather these systems are recharge controlled meaning water table positions are more dependent on transient recharge events than the gravity driven flow of more stable topographically controlled water tables haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 groundwater recharge an essential process by which a downward flux of water enters groundwater storage healy and scanlon 2010 is controlled by complex interactions between precipitation both timing rate and magnitude evaporation to the atmosphere and transpiration by vegetation interception of precipitation by the canopy soil water retention properties and depth to the water table wang et al 2009 2015 turkeltaub et al 2015 carrera hernández et al 2011 smerdon et al 2008 healy and scanlon 2010 although it is an important component in groundwater systems and is vital to understanding subsurface water movement and availability recharge is difficult to measure and the relative importance of these controlling factors is poorly understood healy and scanlon 2010 using a combination of field observations and numerical modelling this study identifies the role of aspen forested hummocks in the generation or loss of groundwater and hydrologic connectivity to adjacent peatlands by examining the simulated recharge patterns and sink source functions of various hummock regimes in the boreal plains a silty clay loam hummock located in the boreal plains is used to develop and calibrate a numerical model to better understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of recharge water table position and lateral flow between the forestland and adjacent peatland the calibrated model is then used for scenario testing to further understand the controls on recharge and forestland peatland interactions specifically we test the effects of altering the height length and hydraulic conductivity of the forested hummock under both wet and dry climatic periods 1 1 motivation numerous forested hummocks have been monitored since 2000 as part of the larger ursa long term observation network devito et al 2016 the hummocks are dominated by trembling aspen populus tremuloides and are adjacent to peatlands the peatlands have fairly stable water elevations 0 5 m above or below the peat surface thompson et al 2015 hokanson et al 2020 however the hummocks exhibit very different water table configurations all of the monitored hummocks at ursa are located in the same 100 km2 region so are subject to the similar annual weather patterns e g p pet nevertheless through the various studies conducted at ursa it is evident that no simple metric annual p multi year cumulative p pet saturated hydraulic conductivity etc is a good predictor for water table elevation or potential mounding within the hummocks hummocks with similar storage potential i e height of hummock above the adjacent peatland may have very different water table behavior over time devito unpublished data hokanson et al 2020 for example two hummocks with similar textures will exhibit extremely different water table patterns where one might exhibit groundwater mounding above the adjacent peatland every year and the other might only wet up once or twice over twenty years consistent groundwater mounding i e the generation of groundwater via recharge and subsequent flow away from the hummock is required for hummocks to act as a hydrologic sources of water and while it is often assumed that local topographic highs like hummocks act as sources of water to the larger landscape it has been shown that this is not the case for many hummocks in the boreal plains hokanson et al 2020 an instrumented hummock was selected to develop and calibrate a variably saturated two dimensional numerical model to simulate observed water table behavior and concomitant recharge rates this particular study hummock was part of a larger modelling effort by thompson et al 2015 thompson et al 2017 thompson et al 2018 who examined the hydrological effects of climate and aspen harvesting however while thompson et al focused on peatland pond and riparian hydrologic dynamics here we focus on the groundwater hydrology of the mineral hummock itself this work uses a numerical model to examine the controls hummock morphometry hydraulic conductivity and annual atmospheric fluxes over recharge water table position and forestland peatland hydrologic interactions in fine textured sub humid glacial environments 2 study area the utikuma region study area ursa 56 n 115 w is located 370 km north of edmonton alberta in the boreal plains ecozone of

hernández et al 2011 focused on water table and recharge dynamics in coarse textured materials in the boreal plain this study focuses on water table and recharge dynamics in the fine textured hummocky moraine regions of ursa these glacial landforms are characterized by silty clay loam hummocks underlain by clays and clay tills where shallow i e 1 15 m below the surface mineral hydraulic conductivity ranges from 1 10 9 to 1 10 6 m s hokanson et al 2019 thompson et al 2015 2 1 study hummock site field measurements the study hummock is in the catchment of pond 40 at ursa petrone et al 2016 thompson et al 2015 and is part of a pond peatland forested hummock complex fig 1b pond 40 and its catchment are located on a regional high which functions as a regional recharge zone with strong vertical gradients ferone and devito 2004 hokanson et al 2019 the hummock is separated from pond 40 by a 50 m wide peatland above which the mineral hummock rises approximately 6 m the study hummock

al 2019 thompson et al 2015 vogwill 1978 the water table elevation in the hillslope was monitored from 2004 to 2018 at three monitoring wells near the crest of the hummock wa mid slope wb and at the toe of the slope wc fig 1c these water levels were recorded both manually i e water level tape and remotely i e pressure transducers with dataloggers solinst hydraulic conductivity of the glacial substrate and upper soil layers were estimated using slug tests and a guelph permeameter respectively these data have been reported previously redding and devito 2011 thompson et al 2015 thompson et al 2018 the pond 40 catchment was clear cut during the winters of 2007 north side of lake 40 and 2008 south side of pond 40 thompson et al 2018 studied the hydrological impacts of this harvest and compared them with an adjacent reference catchment they found that aspen harvesting had limited impacts on groundwater levels beyond the initial post harvest years due to the rapid recovery of aspen evapotranspiration and high soil moisture storage capacity of the native glacial materials thompson et al 2018 depending on the seasonal and interannual climatic conditions the water table exhibits periods with groundwater mounds i e the water table is above the adjacent peatland and periods with groundwater depressions i e the water table is below the adjacent peatland the water table elevation near the top of the hummock wa fig 1c ranges from approximately 1 5 m below the adjacent peatland to more than 3 m above the peatland while the water table in the peatland varies less than 0 5 m in a given year and remains within 0 5 m above or below the peat surface thompson et al 2015 daily p data were collected from 1999 to 2018 at ursa using two to three tipping bucket rain gauges adapted for

obtained from the fort mcmurray weather stations environment canada 2019 precipitation expressed as cumulative departure from the long term mean annual p cdm is used in some analyses the cdm was calculated by a creating a daily time series of annual p a moving sum of daily p with a backward window of 365 days b subtracting the long term annual mean p 444 mm from the moving sum of annual precipitation values resulting in a daily time series of moving window one year departures from the mean cdm 1 and c accumulating the resulting departures over a period of either two or three years cdm 2 cdm 3 this approach of moving window cumulative departures has the advantage of showing both long term cumulative trends in moisture deficit or surplus as well as short term effects such as large melt or storm events smail et al 2019 3 numerical modelling and statistical methods 3 1 general approach the surficial geology at the study site is highly heterogeneous however the model was constructed as a simplified representation with homogeneous layers to capture the essential hydraulic characteristics and behavior of the system yet still be applicable to a range of hummock scenarios this generalization inevitably reduces the accuracy of the transient heads predicted by the model however and more importantly it allows for the model to later be applied to different hummock morphometries without being limited by idiosyncratic site specific features such as a buried sand lens a two dimensional profile from the hillslope crest to the peatland was chosen to represent the system fig 1b and 1c this domain is consistent with the conceptual flow field where lateral flow is from the crest of the hummock to the peatland or vice versa observed water table elevations along the primary study hummock are used to calibrate the model which represents the integrated responses to recharge rates root water uptake and lateral fluxes between the peatland and hummock the calibrated model is then modified for scenario testing to represent other hummock regimes namely by increasing or decreasing the available storage vertically and laterally away from the peatland i e hummock height and length and changing the transmission properties of the hummock substrate i e hydraulic conductivity this approach allows for the identification of the major controls or thresholds governing water table behavior recharge and the development of local groundwater flow systems 3 2 transient variably saturated model due to the sub humid nature of the boreal plain region p et is close to unity meaning small changes in either p or et have large effects on infiltration vadose zone storage root water uptake and ultimately recharge variably saturated conditions are therefore fundamental to understanding the entire system to simulate both saturated and unsaturated conditions transient two dimensional simulations were carried out in hydrus 2d which is a finite element model for simulating the movement of water in variably saturated media by solving the richard s equation with a sink term for root water uptake version 2 05 šimůnek et al 2006 the soil water retention curve and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function were modelled using the van genuchten mualem constitutive relationships mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 3 2 1 model domain and material properties the model domain extends laterally from the middle of the peatland to the crest of the hummock and vertically from the crest of the hill to 26 m depth fig 1c the finite element mesh was discretized such that the upper layers have vertical and horizontal nodal spacing of approximately 0 15 m and 0 45 m respectively the nodal spacing gradually increases with depth so that the lowest part of the domain has vertical and horizontal nodal spacing of approximately 0 8 m and 4 m respectively four primary hydrogeologic units were included in the model peat forest floor soil and glacial till table 1 fig 1c the peatland is represented by two model materials a less dense fibric peat and a denser sapric peat fibric peat is found at the surface and is least decomposed and least dense and sapric peat is found at the bottom and margins of peatlands and is more decomposed and denser the soil horizons are represented by two model layers a forest floor layer representing the lfh litter fibric humic materials and a soil layer representing the a and b horizons the c horizon and underlying glacial till are simplified to a single extensive glacial till unit which has the same soil hydraulic parameters but is discretized into 3 layers upper mid and lower till where the saturated hydraulic conductivity decreases with depth table 1 the soil hydraulic properties of the forest floor soil and glacial till were informed by field measurements and previous modeling efforts redding and devito 2008 2011 thompson et al 2015 thompson et al 2018 before being calibrated an anisotropy ratio kx kz of 30 1 which represents one and a half orders of magnitude contrast was applied for all materials except the peat which had an anisotropy ratio of 10 1 and the forest floor which was isotropic due to the impact they have on recharge the soil hydraulic properties for the forest floor and soil layers were calibrated using a separate but complementary 1d modelling approach utilizing measured soil water content over two winter summer cycles see appendix a for further details on the 1d model construction and calibration when calibrating the 2d model to best simulate water table dynamics along the study hummock the glacial till soil hydraulic properties i e hydraulic conductivity van genuchten alpha and n parameters porosity were adjusted manually in an iterative trial and error approach 3 2 2 boundary and initial conditions the upper surface of the model represents the aspen forestland the peatland and the transition between the two fig 1c net p consisting of daily fluxes of throughfall i e rain not intercepted by vegetation and snow melt after sublimation and root water uptake were applied to the surface of the model composed of the aspen forestland and the narrow peatland forestland transition and peatland margin represented here by sapric peat daily p was considered rain on days with average air temperature greater than 0 c it was then applied directly to the surface of the model after accounting for interception otherwise it was considered snow and accumulated on the surface to determine snowmelt a simple degree day melting model was applied nrcs 2004a nrcs 2004b evaporation was removed from the daily precipitation externally from the model in the forms of rain interception and snow sublimation free water evaporation from the soil surface was assumed to be negligible blanken et al 2001 and therefore not considered a constant daily canopy interception of 0 5 mm in the spring and 2 mm following full leaf out was applied to the daily rain data thompson et al 2015 and 13 of snow water equivalent was removed from melting snow to account for snow sublimation pomeroy et al 1998 daily pet was determined using the hamon 1963 method daily potential transpiration tp was partitioned from daily pet using the leaf area index lai of the hummock vegetation via the beer lambert law ritchie 1972 the initiation of leaf emergence and time until the full leaf period was determined by the cumulative degree day d method where leaf emergence begins when the sum of d exceeds 69 days prior to which lai is zero a fully leafed canopy during which lai is 4 5 and incorporates the aspen canopy and shrub subcanopy little devito unpublished data is assumed when the sum of d reaches 316 days barr et al 2004 between leaf emergence and full leaf out lai increased linearly the senescence of boreal aspen has been found to be primarily controlled by decreased daylight hours therefore the initiation and completion of leaf senescence was set to the same day of year in the hydrologic year starting november 1 226 and 259 respectively for every year barr et al 2004 sutton and price 2020 to simulate the limited effects of aspen harvesting tp was reduced to 0 7 tp for the first post harvest year and returned to full tp by the 7th post harvest year consistent with thompson et al 2018 previous studies have shown that fine shallow lateral roots primarily exploit resources water and nutrients while deep large diameter roots are responsible for structural stability block et al 2006 strong and roi 1983 snedden 2013 found that along a hillslope at the ursa aspen root mass was most concentrated in the top 0 2 0 3 m of the soil profile root water uptake was therefore concentrated in the upper 0 3 m of the hillslope in the model domain the peatland was represented by a constant pressure head boundary ψ 0 3 m which represents a stable water table 0 3 m below the surface of the peatland middle the implications of this are explored in the sensitivity analysis a constant head boundary h 662 m asl ψ 11 m was applied to the base of the model to simulate connection with the deeper regional groundwater flow system this implementation is supported by deep piezometers in the area which show little to no seasonal or inter annual variability in hydraulic head hokanson et al 2019 thompson et al 2015 this lower boundary condition resulted in a downward head gradient of 0 4 similar to the vertical gradients reported by hokanson et al 2019 for the same catchment no flow boundary conditions were applied to the lateral edges of the domain representative initial conditions were obtained by allowing the model to spin up from hydrostatic conditions using observed climate data for the ten years prior to the period of interest ten years was deemed more than sufficient as any period greater than 5 years resulted in equivalent model results 3 3 scenario testing 3 3 1 hummock regimes once calibrated the model domain was modified to represent a spectrum of forested hummock regimes with differing combinations of hydraulic conductivity hummock height and hummock length the topography of the study hummock was simplified and adjusted to represent these hummock morphometries the ground surface elevation z leading away from the peatland was represented by a sine function z a sin e b x where x is the distance into the hillslope away from the peatland a is the vertical distance from the peatland to the top of the hummock i e hummock height b controls the distance from the peatland edge to the hummock crest i e hummock length and e controls the concavity to focus on the controls of hummock morphometry on water table position and recharge e was held constant at a value of 2 hummock height a was to set to 2 6 and 10 m and b was to set to 0 0118 0 018 and 0 038 hummock lengths of approximately 45 85 and 135 m respectively for a total of 9 different hummock morphometry combinations fig 2 of these nine morphometric scenarios a through i hummock e most closely resembles the morphometry of the study hummock used to calibrate the numerical model fig 1c three hydraulic conductivity k scenarios were tested by varying the base k in the glacial till units base k the same conductivities as the study hummock table 1 high k k values increased by an order of magnitude and low k k values decreased by an order of magnitude the combinations of the three heights three lengths and three conductivity scenarios result in 27 unique hummock regimes these parameters were chosen to approximate the range of hummock characteristics morphometry and hydraulic conductivity observed in the field across the glaciated western boreal plains hokanson et al 2020 simulations were run from 1930 to 2018 after a ten year spin up period 1920 1930 and did not include a reduction in tp due to harvesting 3 3 2 sink source dynamics the long term sink or source function for each hummock regime was assessed by examining the water fluxes to and from the adjacent peatland if by the end of the 88 year simulation period more than 90 m3 m i e approximately 1 m3 m yr of water was sourced to the peatland from the hummock or to the hummock from the peatland it was deemed a long term source or sink of water respectively if the function switched or fluctuated or was otherwise very small throughout the simulation and therefore the end net value was less than 90 m3 m in either direction it was deemed a weak sink source in this 2d representation of a 3d hillslope 1 m3 m represents 1 m3 flowing across the peatland forestland interface per meter along the interface 3 3 3 relative controls on groundwater recharge the simulated annual recharge rates 88 years for each of 27 regimes n 2376 were then used to train a boosted regression tree brt ensemble to evaluate the relative importance of the morphometric hydrogeological and climatic controls on the model results brts create hundreds to thousands of regression trees in this case predicting groundwater recharge which are produced forward and stage wise by re weighting residuals from previous trees the final brt model is a linear combination of all the created trees that can be conceptualized as a regression model where each term is a tree elith et al 2008 from which we can estimate each predictor variable s importance by averaging the relative importance or influence of the variables over the collection of trees de ath 2007 brts are valuable because they do not assume normality or stationarity they ignore non informative predictors can accept both numeric and categorical predictors are unaffected by outliers are not prone to overfitting due to correlated or redundant predictors and are efficient at modelling non linear relationships de ath 2007 dormann et al 2013 elith et al 2008 not only do brts build predictive regression models they can provide insight to the relative importance of each predictor variable which are used here to determine which hummock scale parameters influence recharge the most although brts are a relatively new machine learning method they have been successfully applied in previous hydrogeological studies such as developing frameworks for groundwater nitrate models nolan et al 2015 aquifer salinity knierim et al 2020 groundwater spring mapping chen et al 2020 and examining the relative controls of climate and geology on basin water yield sun et al 2019 the brt analysis here was performed in matlab using the machine learning toolbox where a ten fold cross validation process was used to evaluate the performance of the brt model and to prevent overfitting babyak 2004 kohavi 1995 the hyperparameters of the brt e g leaf size number of trees were optimized to improve the accuracy and further prevent the overfitting of the developed brt model similar to that of lou et al 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance 4 1 1 comparing observed and simulated water table elevations simulated transient water table elevations were compared with measured water table elevations at three monitoring wells along the study hummock hillslope wa n 2277 wb n 111 and wc n 87 fig 3 for wa only the continuous data set which was resampled at a daily time step was used for calibration considering all synchronous water table observations and model predictions n 2475 89 of observations were within 1 m of simulated values and 73 of observations were within 0 5 m because we greatly simplified the hydrogeology of the hummock perfectly modelling the minutia of water table dynamics at specific points in the heterogeneous subsurface was never an expectation nevertheless by visually examining the transient simulation results it appears that the model is adequately representing the basic hydrologic functions of the hummock in general the characteristics of the water table hydrographs e g peaks rising limb and recession in the hillslope were well represented by the model fig 3 seasonal and interannual trends were also well represented by the model in most years winter periods show a gradual increase in water table elevation in the modelled data that is absent in the observed data this is an expected artefact of the numerical model since hydrus does not simulate ice or frozen groundwater in the peatland or riparian zones which may lead to increased lateral subsurface flow from the peatland to the hillslope during winter periods the timing of the spring water table rise which is the result of snowmelt infiltration is for the most part accurate however for some years it is early by several weeks and is a limitation of the simplistic degree day melting approach implemented here the rate of melt and therefore potential recharge is dependent on snowpack size and density which can delay melt bartlett et al 2006 the observed water table elevations at the wa monitoring well were considerably lower in the first three years of observational data 2006 2007 and 2008 when compared to the remainder of the time series 2009 to 2019 this discrepancy may be due to several factors for example the monitoring well at wa installed in 2006 had not reached equilibrium with the surrounding fine textured substrate or as redding and devito 2008 noted periodic freeze melt cycles can result in concrete frost which inhibits virtually all snowmelt infiltration alternatively a buried lens of contrasting material could have a threshold effect on water table response which was not explored here 4 1 2 sensitivity analysis this model builds on the work of thompson et al 2015 thompson et al 2018 which contains a detailed sensitivity analysis and emphasizes the role of the pond and peatland this work however focuses on the water table position in the mineral hummock consequently the sensitivity analysis reflects these different objectives changing the lower boundary condition peatland hydraulic conductivity and the range between saturated and residual water content of the till was found to have minimal impacts on the model results changing the soil thickness increase resulted in a decrease in recharge the anisotropy ratio increase resulted in lower water tables and the till unsaturated flow parameters had disproportionate effects at the upper slope of the hummock wa where the vadose zone is thickest compared to the mid slope wb and toe of slope wc regions however changing the elevation of the fixed water table in the peatland decrease resulted in lower water tables had a stronger effect on the water table position in the lower portions of the hummock and a negligible effect in the upper slope the detailed sensitivity analysis can be found in appendix b 4 2 hummock water balance during the 88 year simulation the dominant annual fluxes in the hummock water budget were p and evapotranspiration the sum of evaporation composed of interception and sublimation and root water uptake which had annual mean values of 443 and 385 mm yr respectively over the entire modelling period annual precipitation snowmelt recharge and cdm 1 cdm 2 and cdm 3 for the modelling period are shown in fig 4 all major budget components are plotted in fig 5 for a ten year period hydrologic years 1961 to 1970 which contains some of the highest 186 mm 1970 and lowest 35 mm 1965 recharge rates p is partitioned into evaporation infiltration and runoff fig 5b the latter of which is the residual of p evaporation and infiltration for the entirety of the model run there was little to no surface runoff at the top of the hillslope however during spring melt and high intensity summer storms there was intermittent runoff at the toe of the slope which on an annual basis had a median value of 18 mm yr and is most correlated with precipitation that occurred prior to full leaf out of the aspen r2 0 61 while most years had relatively low runoff values only during especially wet periods i e precipitation prior to full leaf out exceeds 230 mm annual runoff exceeded 85 mm yr large runoff events have been recorded in aspen dominated catchments in the boreal plains but are infrequent and may only occur every 10 to 20 years devito et al 2005 the cumulative change in storage became relatively large i e 75 150 mm in april or may of each year but by the end of the hydrologic year was starting to decline fig 5b however most years ended with an appreciable storage surplus or deficit when compared to the average long term storage in the hummock the maximum end of year storage deficit was 84 mm and the maximum end of year storage surplus was 83 mm fig 6 a the middle 68 i e one standard deviation of the end of year storage difference ranged from 40 mm to 40 mm this indicates that the system does not reset itself each year and there are opportunities for multi year impacts on water levels or recharge that is when the change in storage does not return to zero it may have a disproportionate effect on the next year s recharge as a product of precipitation such behaviour is contrary to the very common assumption that the annual change in storage is zero which can lead to either under or overestimation of other parameters in a water balance study han et al 2020 devito et al 2005 4 2 1 water table elevations and peatland forestland fluxes the hydrographs for all three wells showed seasonal peaks and associated recessions in response to annual spring melt however the hydrographs at wb and wc had earlier peaks and quicker recessions than those at wa a time series of the simulated water table elevations at the three monitoring wells for a selected five year period 1960 1965 are shown in fig 7 b the water table exhibited a similar pattern on an annual basis where the annual spring melt usually in mid april would cause the water table to rise and the subsequent onset of transpiration from the aspen forest land would both retard recharge and draw down the water table reaching a minimum elevation in the late summer or early fall throughout the simulation the water table elevation at the top of the hummock wa was more dynamic than at the mid slope wb and toe of slope wc positions however the water table lower on the hummock were deeper and lower than the peatland for longer durations water table configurations representing the 5 50 95 and 99 percentile ranks are shown with empirical cumulative distribution functions for water table elevations for each well in fig 7a while the trends in the hydrographs were the same along the hillslope the timings were not in sync at the toe and mid slope locations wc and wb respectively the hydrographs would peak and start to decline much earlier than at the crest of the hummock wa water table behaviour of this kind is controlled by the thickness of the unsaturated zone above the water table only the 90th and 95th percentiles cases c and d in fig 7a have water tables that truly follow topography the 5th and 50th percentiles cases a and b in fig 7a show a water table extending from the peatland laterally into the hummock where at the toe and mid slope there is a notable depression for large parts of the year this water table depression is caused by groundwater upflux i e upward flow of water away from the water table into the unsaturated zone due to root water uptake i e transpiration which in turn generates a gradient for groundwater to flow into the depression from the peatland and later in year from upslope near wa fig 7b fluxes of water between the peatland and the forested hummock are transient and vary from year to year and are dependent on water table elevations at the toe of the slope fig 5b and 7b on a daily basis the directions of the flow of water between the peatland and hummock was almost evenly split where the direction of flow was towards the hummock approximately 49 of the time however especially during spring snow melt the magnitude of the fluxes was larger when flow was from the hummock to the peatland and on an annual basis the median peatland flux was 13 mm away from the hummock 4 2 2 groundwater recharge daily recharge was calculated at each location along the hummock i e wa wb wc and was either positive to represent downward flow of water that intersects the water table or negative to represent upflux usually due to root water uptake and redistribution under capillary action fig 5a the spatial distribution of recharge patterns along the hillslope was generally organized into the classic tóthian unit basin tóth 1962 where at the top of the hummock wa there was generally positive recharge throughout the year and at the bottom of the hummock wc there was predominantly upflux this upflux was usually due to root water uptake however when water tables at the mid and toe of the slope were especially high e g hydrologic years 1961 and 1970 in fig 5a wc acted as a groundwater discharge zone and upflux through the land surface was the result the mid slope wb showed greater temporal variability than either wa or wc with recharge dominating in the snow melt season and upflux dominating once transpiration began during leaf out of the aspen forest during most years wa received the most recharge followed by wb and wc this is due to the depth of the water table below the ground surface and the thickness of the unsaturated zone where percolating water has the greatest probability of escaping the rooting zone before it can transpire cross correlation analyses indicate that there is an average 26 day lag time between daily p and recharge at wa whereas the lag times for wb and wc average only 1 day total precipitation applied to the forested hummock which is a combination of throughfall and snow melt after sublimation ranged from 187 to 605 mm yr while recharge at the crest of the hummock wa ranged from only 15 mm to 200 mm fig 4a notably there was no strong correlation between annual recharge and annual precipitation r2 0 16 annual snowmelt r2 0 28 or p pet r2 0 15 however there was a stronger relationship between annual recharge and the sum of the previous two years total precipitation r2 0 48 and the two year departure from the long term mean cdm 2 r2 0 56 this is mostly likely a consequence of the control exerted by the state of the hummock storage i e deficit or surplus at the end of the previous year if a hydrologic year begins under storage deficit conditions a the water table itself is likely lower and transit times through the vadose zone will be longer b the low soil moisture in the vadose zone reduces the effective hydraulic conductivity and c increased available storage must be filled before recharge can commence han et al 2008 wossenyeleh et al 2020 fig 6b shows the relationship between recharge and the storage state at the beginning of the hydrologic year i e at the end of the previous hydrologic year this relationship makes it clear that the previous hydrologic year has a dominant influence on the current year s recharge rate regardless of current atmospheric fluxes 4 3 scenario testing water table elevation and groundwater recharge the 27 hummock regimes presented here test the effects of hummock morphometry height and length and hydraulic conductivity on water table elevation and recharge the general water table behaviour fluctuations frequency of groundwater mounding and recharge rates were evaluated for each scenario and were measured at the top of each respective hummock similar to wa observation point at the study hummock previous studies have focused on plot scale controls on recharge such as van genuchten parameters α and n rooting depth and depth of forest floor material e g lukenbach et al 2019 wang et al 2009 naylor et al 2016 or on regional scale controls such as climate topography and geology healy and scanlon 2010 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 however there is a noticeable lack of studies that examine the hierarchy of controls over water table configurations and recharge at the hillslope or hummock scale and how variations therein affect regional hydrology appels et al 2015 de vries and simmers 2002 hillslopes are nonetheless the building blocks and fundamental units of larger scale hydrologic systems winter 2001 they serve as local topographic highs and are a key scale for the generation and determination of local groundwater flow and discharge patterns systems and therefore all groundwater flow accumulation for intermediate scale systems when comparing the annual recharge rates to either previous studies in the same region or to other regions in the world it is important to note that the recharge rates reported here are for the top of the hummock in a similar position to wa in the study hummock fig 1c water that infiltrates at the top of the hummock has the highest probability of escaping the aspen rooting zone and becoming recharge and therefore represents the upper limits of groundwater recharge for a given hummock furthermore to avoid ambiguity the words short and tall are reserved for describing hummock height while narrow and long are reserved for describing hummock length 4 3 1 effects of hydraulic conductivity within a single hummock morphometric scenario i e hummocks a i fig 2 lower k conditions i e decreasing the k of the glacial till by a factor of 10 generally acted to increase the elevation and the flashiness or seasonal variability of the water table fig 8 in the smaller hummocks short and narrow e g hummock g low k conditions delayed the hydrograph peak most years and generally depressed the water table additionally in the smaller hummocks during years with lower than average snowmelt the late spring hydrograph peak was very muted as the annual melt was held in storage and subsequently removed from the domain by root water uptake during years with average or greater spring snow melt the hydrograph peaks were similar in magnitude between the low and base k conditions conversely in the large hummocks tall and long e g hummock c low k conditions resulted in consistently higher water tables low k conditions also appeared to amplify interannual patterns e g the dry period from 1940 to 1955 where there are prolonged periods of low or high water tables due to climatic conditions discussed below between hummocks the effects of changing k were more amplified in larger hummocks high k conditions i e increasing the k of the glacial till by a factor of 10 had similar effects in all hummocks where the general elevations of the water tables were lowered seasonal fluctuations were amplified and the interannual fluctuations were dampened in all cases the high k scenarios resulted in water tables with elevations similar to that of the peatland this is due to increased root water uptake and increased lateral distribution of water within the hummock which results in a generally flat water table as the higher k substrates cannot support a steep gradient over such a short distance for the shorter hummocks i e 2 and 6 m high the longer the hummock was the deeper the water tables were under high k conditions temporarily perched water tables were a frequent phenomena in the low k scenarios fig 8 and resulted from high precipitation events quickly saturating the soil and top of the till while the underlying till remained unsaturated however these conditions only lasted for a few days before the saturated front dispersed through the soil profile or was taken up by the aspen changing the k had dramatic effects on the annual recharge rates for all the hummocks where high k scenarios increased the median annual recharge by an average of 150 and low k conditions decreased the median annual recharge by an average of 70 fig 9 annual recharge rates under low k conditions did not have very much interannual variability however under high k conditions the spread was considerably larger 4 3 2 effects of hummock morphometry the effects of hummock morphometry on both water table elevation and recharge can be seen in figs 8 and 9 respectively hummock height and length have strong synergistic effects where increases in both height and length result in elevated water tables and increased recharge however increasing only one parameter does not cause an increase in either water table elevation or recharge for example an especially tall and narrow hummock hummock a does not have appreciably higher water table elevations compared to a shorter hummock of the same length hummock g increasing the length while keeping the height the same e g from hummock d to f reduces the recharge and promotes groundwater depressions beneath the hummock the increased hummock height and narrow length promote increased flux to and from the peatland and the short lateral distance does not promote the development of high hydraulic gradients so the propensity for groundwater mounding is low conversely the tallest and longest hummock c has the highest recharge rates and most elevated water tables while hummock i which is both short and long has the lowest recharge rates and water tables the variation in recharge between tall and short hummocks and long and narrow hummocks mirrors the spatial variability of recharge along the slope i e distance and elevation from the peatland in the study hummock fig 5a the actual annual recharge rates violin plots in fig 9 had high interannual variability especially under base and high k conditions due to large variability in annual precipitation fig 4 however the ratio of recharge to available net precipitation i e precipitation after interception and sublimation recharge p e showed much less variability between years and allows for more robust comparisons between hummock regimes regardless of annual precipitation conditions box plots in fig 9 when examining only the base k conditions the median recharge p ratios ranged from as low as 0 04 hummock i to as high as 0 42 hummock c which have the longest hummock length tested both absolute and variability in recharge p ratios were higher in the taller hummocks this supports previous findings which show that increasing the unsaturated zone thickness also increases the probability of recharge smerdon et al 2008 who performed 1d models of outwash sands and gravels found a threshold height of 4 m above the water table is required for reliable recharge lukenbach et al 2019 who performed 2d simulations of forest floor material over tailings sand in a reclaimed mining landscape found a similar threshold of only 2 m above the water table additionally we show that both distance and elevation along a hummock are key factors in controlling recharge in these water limited environments fig 5a and 9 therefore the common practice in saturated groundwater flow modelling of applying a uniform recharge rate across similar land units could result in gross over or underestimations of actual recharge through space in small or mesoscale models systems although only the effects of hummock length and height were explicitly tested here there is an opportunity to examine the effects of topography on potential recharge the study hummock has a subtly undulating ground surface topography fig 1c and when this surface was simplified by smoothing this undulation was removed the hummock scenario that most closely resembles the study hummock is hummock e fig 2 under the same geologic and atmospheric conditions the study hummock had a median annual recharge rate of 89 mm yr 45 mm standard deviation and hummock e hummock only had a median annual recharge rate of 57 mm yr 13 mm hummock e had both significantly less recharge p 0 001 and much less interannual variability the variation in ground surface elevation in the study hummock creates a depression that allows for focused recharge before it leaves the system as runoff these various forms of relief on a single hillslope in the form of both microtopography and mesotopography e g on the scales of centimeters and tens of meters respectively have been shown to focus infiltration and enhance recharge appels et al 2015 2017 le and kumar 2014 thompson et al 2010 4 3 3 effects of climate across all 27 hummock regimes there were notable temporal patterns in water table elevations regardless of morphometry or conductivity that are attributed to interannual precipitation patterns fig 4a and 8 notably there were extended periods with lower than normal water tables e g from about 1940 to 1950 and from about 1998 to 2005 and higher than normal water tables e g from about 1955 to 1965 and from about 1975 to 1980 present in each hummock regime these wet and dry periods align very well with the cdm 2 and cdm 3 precipitation indices however on an annual basis e g annual p or cdm 1 there is little correlation in most cases for example in 2000 the simulated recharge total at the study hummock was 41 mm fig 4 which represents the 16th percentile of annual recharge and the water table elevations were far below average however the annual p was 442 mm which would be considered an average year i e long term mean annual p is 444 mm fig 4 while the cdm 1 was essentially zero for that year the cdm 2 and cdm 3 were approximately 80 mm and 250 mm respectively this further highlights the role that multi year storage deficits or surpluses play in modulating annual atmospheric fluxes these multi year water deficits and surpluses have large implications for both land management and research approaches common time scales for site investigations environmental assessments or even scientific research efforts are on the order of one to several years however climate cycles in the boreal plains are on the order of 15 years fig 4a mwale et al 2009 consequently results and implications from any site investigation must be put into a long term climatic context through understanding of relationships and processes such as those developed here 4 4 sink source function of hummocks a conductivity paradox the sink source relationship between the forested hummock and adjacent peatland is dependent not on the magnitude of recharge but on the water table position within the hummock which drives lateral hydraulic gradients between the land units fig 8 the long term hydrologic function i e sink or source to the adjacent peatland was affected by all three tested parameters i e hummock length height and hydraulic conductivity by varying degrees hydraulic conductivity had the greatest effect whereby in all but the largest hummock c high k conditions resulted in the hummock being a long term sink moreover hummock c alternated between being a sink and a source depending on climatic conditions and was therefore classified as a weak sink source although dramatically increased recharge may be present under the high k scenarios fig 9 the increased k also allows for increased lateral redistribution of water within the hummock and permits more water to be available for root water uptake by the aspen forest it is also important to note that the k values presented here do not represent the full range of k present in the glaciated boreal plains region of canada but a range of k representative of fine textured moraine deposits the paradox of relatively increased k conditions e g kz 1 10 7 m s resulting in a hummock with elevated recharge rates while also acting as a hydrologic sink would not arise under high k conditions e g kz 1 10 4 m s in a sand hummock the latter would have especially high recharge rates while also acting as a hydrologic source because water would percolate quickly to a low water table below the rooting zone and flow laterally to adjacent land units hummock height had less control over the sink source function of the hummock by which hummocks of similar length but varying height had similar sink source functions based on hydraulic conductivity regardless of height e g hummocks a d g fig 9 interestingly while the longest hummocks f and i were sinks in all cases the longest and tallest hummock c was either a long term source low and base k or weak sink source high k the longer the hummock the larger and or more persistent the groundwater depression caused by root water uptake similar to that shown in fig 7a can become resulting in a long term sink of water from the landscape this phenomenon has also been observed in the prairie pothole region between wetlands and adjacent uplands rosenberry and winter 1997 however at some threshold height e g 10 m above the peatland hummock c a sustained gradient provides a consistent source of water to neighboring land units it is common to conceptualize the water table as a subdued replica of surface topography where water flows from topographic highs to topographic lows this concept is also widely applied to peatland hydrology where the assumption of peatlands being fed water by adjacent forestlands through topography driven flow is ubiquitous hokanson et al 2020 however as we show here the sink source function of a hummock in a sub humid landscape is highly sensitive to both hydrogeological properties and hummock morphometry the sink source function of a land unit and it s proclivity to change through time is crucial to understanding the regional water balance both now and in the future in water limited environments it has been shown at the basin scale that peatlands and forestlands have important but competing roles in influencing surface and subsurface hydrological systems both through empirical observations devito et al 2017 and numerical models hwang et al 2018 boreal plains peatlands despite existing in a water deficit environment have lower actual evapotranspiration rates than forestlands barker et al 2009 devito et al 2005 2017 petrone et al 2007 prepas et al 2006 which when coupled with the internal water conserving feedback mechanisms typical of boreal peatlands waddington et al 2015 makes them primary water sources to the larger landscape in the boreal plains forested hummocks which at the basin scale average don t provide as much water as peatlands may be important at the local scale future work is needed to explore the thresholds and implications that various landscape topologies and topographies may have on intermediate and regional groundwater and surface water systems 4 5 controls on groundwater recharge the modelled annual recharge rates from each hummock regime over the 88 year simulation were used to train a boosted regression tree brt to examine and rank the relative importance of each of the tested hummock parameters hummock height hummock length and glacial till hydraulic conductivity as well as several annual climatic variables potential evapotranspiration pet total precipitation prior to full leaf out throughfall and snowmelt the overall performance of the final trained and fitted brt model can be seen in fig 10 a which had an rmse of 17 mm and an r squared of 0 96 there was no pronounced under or overestimation of annual recharge and the model performed well over the range of hummock regimes tested here the relative predictor importance can be seen in fig 10b where it is clear that in fine textured landscapes hydrogeologic and morphometric factors exerted far more influence than annual climatic variables the hydraulic conductivity had by far the greatest effect on annual recharge followed by hummock height and length which had equal importance these patterns are evident but not entirely obvious in fig 9 where the greatest disparity in annual recharge can be seen between k scenarios and that hummock height and length appear to have a synergistic effect of the climatic variables snow melt was most important followed by throughfall these results confirm observations from several empirical and modeling studies from the same region which showed that surficial geology had a larger control over hydrological responses than climate or topography hokanson et al 2019 and that annual recharge is mostly sourced from spring melt smerdon et al 2008 thompson et al 2015 the brt machine learning method was used here to explore the relative importance of each hydrogeological and climatic variable however it s successful implementation and high prediction confidence makes it clear that it has the potential to be a valuable tool in predicting hydrological responses to highly non linear and interdependent processes in complex landscapes such as the boreal plains when looking at the timing of the hydrographs from the top of both the study hummock and the various hummock regimes figs 3 7b 8 as well as the cumulative recharge along the study hummock fig 5a it is surprising that snowmelt or precipitation prior to full leaf out did not have significantly higher estimated importance when compared to throughfall this is likely because while the timing of the annual hydrograph indicates recharge sourced from spring snow melt there is a low correlation between the actual magnitude of recharge and the magnitude of the spring melt due to the effects of antecedent storage deficits or surpluses fig 6b 5 summary conclusions the controls on the spatiotemporal variability of water table elevation recharge and the sink source function of fine textured forested hummocks in low releif low recharge environments were explored using a two dimensional variably saturated flow model in addition to a site specific model which was created to simulate a study hummock in the boreal plains region of canada with over 13 years of collected hydrogeologic observations 27 generic model domains were created to represent a range of hummock morphometries and hydraulic conductivities we found that between hummocks geology and morphometry had a greater control over recharge rates than annual atmospheric fluxes specifically high conductivity values and larger hummock heights resulted in greatly elevated recharge rates however higher hydraulic conductivity values and longer hummock lengths also allowed for more root water uptake had a greater propensity for water table depressions and resulted in the hummock acting as a hydrologic sink taller hummocks with lower conductivity values tended to act as hydrologic sources within a single hummock regime the magnitude of recharge and water table elevation responses were poorly correlated with annual atmospheric fluxes due to the strong residual effects of storage deficits and surpluses within the hummock however the timing of water table hydrographs both observed and simulated indicate that the bulk of recharge is sourced from spring melt recharge and water table elevation did correlate well with both two and three year cumulative departure from the long term mean annual precipitation this study demonstrates that both recharge rates and the sink source function of fine textured forested hummocks are highly dependent on and sensitive to geology and morphometry of the hummock in heterogeneous glacial landscapes recharge is therefore highly variable in space and time additionally while the magnitude of recharge and water table elevation are less sensitive to annual atmospheric fluxes they are markedly affected by the decadal wet dry cycles typical of the boreal plains climate improving our understanding of the spatial and temporal variation of recharge and water table elevation will promote better management practices and assist in planning for the future the boreal plains are home to ever increasing and unprecedented anthropogenic disturbance in the forms of forestry agriculture oil and gas operations and climate change predicting the local scale hydrologic connections and sink source relationships between land units is necessary to manage and mitigate

on behalf of all authors the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest appendix a complementary 1d model a one dimensional model was constructed in hydrus 1 d šimůnek et al 2008 to simulate measured volumetric water content vwc at a soil pit located near the wa well on the study hummock fig 2 this modelling was performed to assign appropriate van genuchten mualem soil hydraulic parameters for the forest floor and upper soil layers in the 2d model of the primary text the soil pit was instrumented with five soil water content probes csi model 616 campbell scientific inc logan utah at the following depths 0 05 m lfh forest floor 0 2 m 0 4 m 0 6 m 0 95 m the calibrated van genuchten mualem vgm soil hydraulic parameters were then used in the 2d model for the forest floor and soil layers fig 2 table 1 fig a1 the 1d model was constructed to be 10 m deep and discretized into 0 01 m layers with a constant pressure head lower boundary condition where ψ 4 2 m this translates to a water table ψ 0 positioned 5 8 m below the soil pit which was the highest water table elevation during the instrumented period soil layer thicknesses saturated hydraulic conductivity k saturated soil water content θs bulk density and soil texture sand and clay for the forest floor and soil horizons were explored and quantified by redding 2009 for this and nearby hummocks these values were used both as a starting point and to constrain the calibrated vgm parameters the vgm α and n parameters were initially informed by pedotransfer function values for soils with parameters similar to those reported in redding and devito 2008 for the forest floor and upper soil layers rosetta schaap et al 2001 the vgm parameters were then calibrated to best simulate the observed vwc for each soil layer corresponding to each sensor depth the final calibrated suite of vgm parameters yielded simulated vwc that had an r squared of 0 95 and a root mean square weighted error of 0 0059 when compared to the observed vwc the model was fairly insensitive to the parameters attributed to the till therefore they were not optimized in the 1d modelling exercise and were the focus of the calibration of the 2d model in the main manuscript the final calibrated vgm parameters for the 1d model can be seen in table a1 however in the subsequent 2d model domain the soil layers were generalized and are represented by 2 layers the forest floor 0 1 m thick and the combined a and b horizons 0 6 m thick table a1 appendix b sensitivity analysis of the 2d model this model serves as a natural outgrowth or continuation of the work conducted by thompson et al 2015 thompson et al 2018 which contains a much more detailed sensitivity analysis and has more emphasis on the role of the peatland and atmospheric fluxes i e et and p the scope of this work however is focused on the water table position in the mineral hummock the subsequent sensitivity analysis therefore reflects this several model parameters and boundary conditions were considered for the sensitivity analysis soil thickness above the glacial till the anisotropy ratio the van genuchten α and n parameters of the till and the peatland water table elevation the results of this analysis can be seen in fig b1 changing the lower boundary condition peatland vgm parameters and the range between saturated and residual water content of the till was found to have minimal impacts on the model results and are therefore not reported here changing the soil thickness the anisotropy ratio and the till unsaturated flow parameters had disproportionate effects at the upper slope of the hummock wa where the vadose zone is thickest compared to the mid slope wb and toe of slope wc regions however changing the elevation of the fixed water table in the peatland had a stronger effect on the water table position in the lower portions of the hummock and had a negligible effect in the upper slope the soil layer which represents the weathered a and b horizons below the forest floor and above the parent material has a large control over groundwater recharge lukenbach et al 2019 naylor et al 2016 the soil layer acts to hold and retard infiltration from precipitation before it percolates to deeper regions beyond the aspen root zone when the soil layer is thick e g it extends to 1 0 m below the model surface groundwater recharge is reduced thereby reducing and delaying the spring peak in the groundwater mound elevation contrastingly reducing the soil thickness e g it extends to 0 3 m below the model surface has the opposite effect where the spring groundwater mound elevation peak is increased by approximately 2 5 m and advanced by approximately 20 days this has been explored thoroughly in lukenbach et al 2019 who found similar results in a reclamation setting anisotropy in the model was adjusted by holding the vertical hydraulic conductivity constant and increasing the horizontal hydraulic conductivity by applying a multiplier for all scenarios the forest floor was kept isotropic as the anisotropy ratio kx kz increased from the base case 30 1 to 100 1 the groundwater mound elevation decreased and seasonal water table fluctuations were dampened as the resistance to lateral flow decreased conversely under isotropic conditions 1 1 groundwater mounding was increased and seasonal water table fluctuations were amplified there were discrepancies in some years in the form of late season precipitation events for example in 2011 2013 and 2016 it is evident that significant mid and late summer precipitation events caused rises in the water table at wa however they were not present in the simulated water tables fig 4a this is most likely due to the presence of dual permeability perhaps in the form of macropore or fracture flow in the till that is not captured in the model if a high enough kz value 5 10 2 m d was used the late season hydrograph peaks could be seen however the overall timing and magnitude of the hydrographs were too early and low respectively fig b1e the van genuchten α and n parameters were therefore calibrated in conjunction with hydraulic conductivity holistically to best represent the system as a whole again as a means of avoiding over parameterizing the model so as to increase it s applicability elsewhere the effects of changing the vgm parameters α and n can be shown in fig b1d and b1e higher values of α and n parameters result in greater groundwater recharge and therefore higher water tables fig b1e consistent with previous findings wang et al 2009 in the model the upper boundary condition in the peatland is a specified pressure head ψ of 0 3 m in other words the water table is fixed at a depth of 0 3 m below the peat surface for this sensitivity analysis the water table elevation was increased to be equal to the peat surface ψ 0 and decreased to depth of 1 m ψ 1 0 m to show the effects that a high and low water table configuration in the peatland would have on the adjacent hillslope the change in peatland water table position had negligible effects on the water table behaviour in the upper slope of the hummock however areas closer to the peatland had more amplified effects fig b1c at the toe of the slope wc adjacent to the peatland margin the decrease in peatland water table position caused a corresponding decrease in the fall hillslope water table of approximately 0 3 0 4 m in the mid slope region the water tables showed lower positions in the fall but the spring peaks area similar within 0 2 m of the base case 
4167,satellite rainfall products are one of the most valuable tools for water resources monitoring in data scarce regions due to their low latency and quasi global range however there are still uncertainties associated with rainfall products performance used to estimate hydrologic signatures in several regions such as brazil here we investigate the performance of three rainfall products in estimating daily precipitation daily river discharge and hydrologic signatures over brazil the sm2rain ascat and the gpm sm2rain satellite products and the era5 reanalysis product we used a subset of 520 catchments from the catchments attributes for brazil cabra dataset and the hydrologic modeling was carried out using the misdc hydrologic model satellite based products performed better than era5 for most brazilian biomes in estimating daily precipitation when compared with ground observations used as reference daily river discharge was also better modeled with sm2rain ascat and gpm sm2rain hydrologic modeling presented low values of bias and 80 of catchments with kge 0 5 in calibration lastly hydrologic signatures were well estimated by sm2rain ascat and gpm sm2rain and for some biomes atlantic forest cerrado and caatinga they are better predictors than ground based observations we showed that there is a significant added value when using sm2rain ascat and gpm sm2rain products in tropical catchments allowing a high quality continuous water resources monitoring even in data scarce regions besides our findings pave the way for a better understanding of hydrologic extremes droughts and floods using these satellite rainfall products on multiple spatial and temporal scales keywords satellite climate streamflow catchments hydrologic signatures 1 introduction precipitation is a prerequisite for human life and development and its monitoring is crucial for several applications in many fields such as hydrology climatology geology and agriculture it is of great interest for understanding earth s system as a whole barrett and beaumont 1994 as it is considered the most important variable in geosciences maggioni and massari 2018 due to its high spatio temporal variability it is a hard variable to measure with a considerable uncertainty associated and the ground based rainfall monitoring generally suffers from a lack of station s density especially in developing countries barrett and beaumont 1994 brocca et al 2020 xavier et al 2016 among the alternative options to ground based stations currently available for precipitation monitoring weather prediction models weather radar and satellite based observations the satellite based products are the most comprehensive and viable and sometimes the unique source of information with low cost and easy access for users in data scarce regions brocca et al 2019 camici et al 2020 massari et al 2020 wagner et al 2012 products like the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm have been extensively used worldwide and it is one of the most known satellite rainfall products huffman et al 2007 the bottom up approach for precipitation monitoring arose in recent years and uses the soil moisture of soil to estimate and improve the precipitation over land contrary to the conventional and most commonly used approach top down brocca et al 2014 a set of papers using the kalman filter kf and satellite soil moisture have been published crow et al 2009 crow and ryu 2009 crow and zhan 2007 showing improvements in rainfall and streamflow estimates pellarin et al 2009 pellarin et al 2013 adopted an antecedent precipitation index api constrained with the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos amsr e to improve trmm satellite based rainfall product recently brocca et al 2019 presented a new satellite based rainfall product based on soil moisture the sm2rain ascat this product is based on the implementation of the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2014 to soil moisture observations from the advanced scatterometer ascat unlike the previous ones the sm2rain ascat is a rainfall product estimated with soil moisture and not corrected by soil moisture the sm2rain based rainfall products were also combined with the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg resulting in an enhanced product named gpm sm2rain massari et al 2020 the sm2rain ascat and gpm sm2rain are the most advanced satellite based rainfall products that use the bottom up approach so far both are low latency 1 day with a global range that may be useful for continuous monitoring of water resources despite the facility and advantages of using the satellite based rainfall products we must keep in mind that still have uncertainties associated brocca et al 2014 and these uncertainties are transferred to the applications such as hydrological modeling thus it is important to assess not only the reliability of estimating precipitation but also the suitability for river discharge simulation or any other application as done in brocca et al 2020 brunetti et al 2021 and camici et al 2020 for instance brunetti et al 2021 employed the sm2rain ascat and the gpm products and their integration to perform landslide forecasting in india establishing that the satellite rainfall products generally outperform ground based observations in this goal hydrological signatures are important indicators to provide an understanding of the hydrological functionality and behavior of a catchment sawicz et al 2011 because of this the hydrologic signatures can also be used as indicators of hydrologic modeling ability in simulate catchment s responses variability euser et al 2013 therefore if a combination of rainfall product and hydrologic model can provide accurate hydrologic signatures it is a good indicator of product model capability to reproduce the hydrological behavior of a catchment brazil is a country covering almost 50 of south america s area presenting heterogeneous hydrological climatic and geophysical attributes it should be underlined that between 12 and 18 of the world s renewable freshwater flows in brazilian rivers rodrigues et al 2015 unep and ana 2007 despite being one of the most important countries to the global water fluxes brazil has a scarce allocation of funding for hydro meteorological monitoring which creates great challenges for proper knowledge of its water resources including precipitation there is a lack of gauge stations for precipitation monitoring as shown in xavier et al 2016 with stations density lower than recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo making the satellite rainfall products an important tool for water resources monitoring in brazil some studies have been carried out to evaluate the performance of sm2rain based rainfall products in brazil paredes trejo et al 2018 evaluated the performance of sm2rain cci ciabatta et al 2018 product to simulate rainfall characteristics and temporal distribution over northeastern brazil showing quite good performance on daily estimations later paredes trejo et al 2019 expanded the previous analysis for entire brazil and found that sm2rain based products cci and ascat can be effectively used for water resources and agricultural purposes on a daily scale however none of the abovementioned studies address broader applications of the satellite rainfall products such as river discharge and hydrologic signatures estimations across the country thus the performance of hydrological applications of satellite based rainfall products that use a bottom up approach is still unknown for brazilian catchments to our knowledge this is the first study evaluating and validating the performance of the bottom up satellite rainfall products in simulating daily river discharge and hydrologic signatures for brazilian catchments thus the objective of this study is to assess the performance of the sm2rain ascat and gpm sm2rain rainfall products in simulating daily precipitation in brazil for that at the catchment scale the sm2rain based products are compared with ground based observations used as a reference and the performance is evaluated against a widely used reanalysis rainfall product era5 hersbach et al 2020 moreover the hydrological application of these data in simulating daily river discharge on 520 brazilian catchments is investigated we have used a large sample catchment attributes dataset the catchment attributes for brazil cabra to calibrate and validate the simulations of the misdc hydrological model brocca et al 2011 2 study area our study adopts 520 catchments in brazil as case studies they are located in six different biomes throughout brazil amazon atlantic forest cerrado caatinga pampa and pantanal see fig 1 brazil has continental dimensions with 8 500 000 km2 ranging from longitudes 34 w to 73 w and latitudes 6 n to 34 s catchment areas range from 22 to 4 800 000 km2 covering a wide range of climate patterns land use geology and soil types according to almagro et al 2020b precipitation in brazil ranges from 400 mm year 1 in the caatinga which is a semi arid region comprised mostly by secondary vegetation herbaceous and arboreous with a severe dry season to 4 000 mm year 1 in the amazon the largest tropical biome in the world consisting of a densely vegetated rainforest high values of precipitation are also observed in the atlantic forest characterized by rainforest cover in the coastal area and the semi deciduous forest in the continental intermediate amounts of precipitation 1 500 to 2 500 mm year 1 are observed in the cerrado woodlands and savanna the pantanal one of the largest flooded areas in the world and in the pampa biome predominance of natural pastures with tree formations and sparse shrub 3 datasets 3 1 ground observations to evaluate the bottom up remote sensing precipitation products we used a gridded interpolated product derived from observations developed by xavier et al 2016 for entire brazil as a ground truth reference this product used observed precipitation data and many other climatic variables derived from approximately 4 000 rain gauges from the brazilian water agency ana the national institute of meteorology inmet and the water and electric energy department of são paulo state daee sp presenting a 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution and covering the 1980 2015 period moreover this reference dataset has been extensively applied in previous studies such as evaluation of remote sensing products melo et al 2015 paredes trejo et al 2018 paredes trejo and barbosa 2017 paredes trejo et al 2017 vegetation response to rainfall variability souza et al 2016 impacts of climatic extremes melo et al 2016 and climate change historical simulations and projections almagro et al 2017 2020 avila diaz et al 2020 the xavier s dataset can be accessed through http careyking com data downloads the observed river discharge for the brazilian catchments is derived from the catchment attributes for brazil cabra dataset developed by almagro et al 2021 the cabra dataset is a large sample dataset of catchment attributes for 735 catchments in brazil the authors collected synthesized organized and made available a set of 100 catchment attributes for eight main classes topography climate streamflow groundwater soil geology land cover and hydrological disturbance due to the continental scale of brazil there is high heterogeneity in the hydrological behavior of the catchments cabra provides daily river discharge for each of its catchments which was obtained from the ana covering the hydrological period from 1980 to 2010 with high quality records 10 of missing data moreover cabra river discharge data were quality checked for inconsistencies and outliers the cabra dataset is available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 4070146 to increase the performance evaluation reliability we have extended the time series of river discharge from the cabra dataset to overlap the whole period of satellite monitoring so the cabra dataset used in this study is an updated version of the published one covering the 2007 2018 period 3 2 rainfall products in this study we adopted three different precipitation products to conduct the performance on precipitation estimates and hydrological modeling two of them are satellite derived sm2rain ascat and the gpm sm2rain the last one is derived from reanalysis data the era5 the first remote sensing product used in this study is sm2rain ascat sm2rain ascat is a gridded rainfall dataset based on soil moisture which is commonly called as bottom up method the sm2rain algorithm is based on the inversion of the soil water balance equation to estimate the amount of water entering the soil by using soil moisture as input sm2rain ascat rainfall product uses the satellite observations of soil moisture data from the advanced scatterometer ascat carried by three satellites from the metop family the sm2rain ascat precipitation product was developed by brocca et al 2019 presents a spatial resolution of 12 5 km and its latest release covers the 2007 2020 period sm2rain ascat has been extensively tested and applied throughout the world since its release and appears as a valuable product for short latency rainfall monitoring sm2rain ascat is referred to here as sm2rasc and version 1 2 used in the study can be download at https zenodo org record 3635932 the second satellite rainfall product used here is gpm sm2rain this product is a short latency daily 25 km satellite based rainfall product generated by integrating the imerg er and sm2rain products it was developed by massari et al 2020 by using the optimal linear combination olc approach bishop and abramowitz 2013 which optimally merges multiple estimates from the same climatological variable rainfall in this case by minimizing the error with a calibration dataset the era5 gpm sm2rain covers the 2007 2018 period is referred to here as gpmsm2r and is available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 3345322 the third precipitation product used in our study is the era5 reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 era5 is the latest version of climate reanalysis data from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and provides hourly daily and monthly data on several atmospheric sea and land variables as a reanalysis dataset era5 employs past observations and models to generate accurate and consistent time series of climate variables and parameters being one of the most widely used datasets in geosciences era5 precipitation is available at 36 km spatial resolution from 1950 to the present here we also make use of the era5 s temperature product for the hydrological modeling input era5 products can be explored and downloaded through the copernicus climate data store https cds climate copernicus eu 4 methodology 4 1 hydrologic modeling to perform the hydrologic modeling we have used the modello idrologico semi distribuito in continuo misdc brocca et al 2011 which is a semi distributed continuous rainfall runoff model the misdc is a parsimonious and reliable rainfall runoff model to estimate the total streamflow considering the wetness conditions of the soil before the rainfall event to calibrate its nine parameters table 1 the misdc solves the objective function to maximize the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 between the simulated and observed river discharge the calibration period was taken in the first 7 years of data jan 2007 to mar 2014 with a warm up period of one year while the validation period englobes the apr 2014 to dec 2018 period misdc model has been widely used in recent years brocca et al 2020 conducted a study in 10 catchments in europe west africa and south africa and found that the remote sensing products outperform the gauge based rainfall products in simulating daily river discharge for western africa catchments in europe camici et al 2020 tested the accuracy of different satellite rainfall products against observations for 1318 catchments covering 23 countries using misdc the authors found that sm2rain ascat is the most reliable product for river discharge simulation across europe to minimize the uncertainties of the hydrological modeling we filtered the total number of catchments selecting only those with long and consistent series from the extended version of the cabra dataset almagro et al 2021 we have applied the following criteria only perennial catchments with data covering all the observation period of the remote sensing products 12 years from jan 2007 to dec 2018 and with 5 of missing data this procedure reduced the number of catchments from 735 to 520 covering five of six brazilian biomes 4 2 hydrologic signatures to assess the long term reliability of the satellite rainfall products we calculated a series of hydrological signatures that quantifies the hydrological characteristics providing a better understanding of hydrological behavior these signatures can be used to explain the catchment s variability in responses to climate forcings we calculated for the 520 catchments a subset of 11 hydrological signatures for the sm2rasc gpmsm2r era5 and the ground based reference product related to the magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change of river discharge sawicz et al 2011 and westerberg and mcmillan 2015 listed in table 2 the calculation of the hydrological series was carried out using the toolbox for streamflow signatures in hydrology tossh developed by gnann et al 2021 4 3 performance evaluation on precipitation estimates and hydrologic modeling to evaluate the performance and quality of simulated precipitation against the observed data product during an overlap period 2007 2015 between them we used the following statistical metrics bias bias root mean squared error rmse and correlation coefficient cc eqs 1 3 1 bias 1 n i 1 n p sim i p obs i

included two more widely used performance metrics to calibrate and evaluate hydrologic models with observed data the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 described in eqs 4 and 5 both metrics might be interpreted in the same way but with different approaches the closer to 1 is the nse and kge the better is the agreement between simulations and observations when nse and kge 0 0 41 it indicates that it is better to use the mean as a predictor 4 nse 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 i 1 n q obs i μ obs 2 5 kge 1 r 1 2 σ sim σ obs 1 2 μ

are presented in fig 2 the sm2rasc bias of daily precipitation is close to zero in almost all brazilian biomes with exception of the amazon where it shows overestimation in central amazon and underestimation in western and eastern portions the bias presented by the merged product gpmsm2r is slightly greater than sm2rasc but still with most of the areas with values close to zero on the other hand the era5 rainfall product follows the same pattern of sm2rasc underestimating overestimating the precipitation in all amazon and close to zero bias on most of brazil in rmse spatial analysis sm2rasc and gpmsm2r perform similarly and the era5 product presents the highest values up to 10 mm day 1 the correlation coefficient presents better performance in satellite rainfall products than in era5 products with the highest values in amazon pampa and caatinga showing its high reliability on estimating the precipitation in different regions of brazil with different climates and seasonal cycles the added value of satellite rainfall products in relation to era5 can be seen in the radar chart in all regions and biomes of brazil fig 3 and table 3 the radar chart allows us to infer what is the most suitable product by the area of the polygon since better values of each performance skill are converging to the center of the chart the lower the polygon s area the better is the product represented by this polygon for almost all biomes on average the satellite rainfall products perform better than the era5 estimations the exception is the caatinga where era5 presents the best performances in the area averaged values of bias and rmse referred to as abias and armse 5 2 streamflow estimates on brazilian catchments the performance of the sm2rasc gpmsm2r and era5 rainfall products in simulating the river discharge of brazilian catchments during the calibration period carried from jan 2007 to mar 2014 from the misdc hydrological model is illustrated in fig 4 all products present a close to zero mean daily river discharge bias bias q in most of the catchments with some overestimated values in the southern portion and underestimated values in the northeastern part especially in the são francisco river basin this is probably due to the large reservoir s regulation capacity and due to the groundwater exploration in this region as shown in almagro et al 2021 and lucas et al 2021 which is not taken into account in the hydrological modeling on median terms mbias q the gpmsm2r and era5 present best performances with absolute mbias q 0 001 mm day 1 followed by the sm2rasc mbias q 0 006 mm day 1 spatial variability of mean daily river discharge root mean squared error rmse q shows a similar pattern and median values ranging from 0 780 to 0 923 mm day 1 with rmse q 2 mm day 1 for 80 of the catchments the highest values of rmse q are found for the southern region in the pampa biome reaching up to 5 mm day 1 the mean nash sutcliffe efficiency for daily river discharge nse q demonstrates a better performance of gpmsm2r against other products analyzed here with median value of 0 614 and 68 of the catchments with nse q 0 5 considering the sm2rasc and era5 products we found median values of nse q mnse q of 0 501 and 0 453 and 51 and 42 of the catchments with nse q 0 5 in terms of the kling gupta efficiency on daily river discharge kge q all products perform well with median values mkge q higher than 0 7 sm2rasc presented kge q 0 5 in 82 of the catchments mkge q 0 748 while in gpmsm2r and era5 there were 92 mkge q 0 807 and 85 mkge q 0 727 respectively values of kge q 0 5 in the southern portion of brazil should be attributed to the absence of a well defined seasonality of precipitation in this region which is important to establish a temporal correlation between observations and simulations another point to note is the poor performance in terms of nse q and kge q for some catchments in the caatinga biome in northeastern brazil we can explain the poor performance by the large number of reservoirs in catchments located in this region which again is not taken in account in the hydrological modeling in fig 5 the results of performance scores on the validation period carried from apr 2014 to dec 2018 from the hydrological modeling are shown the same color scheme from the calibration period was kept for a direct comparison between modeling phases the bias q from all rainfall products presents higher values than the calibration period keeping the characteristic of underestimation in the southern portion in the pampa biome sm2rasc presents mbias q value of 0 178 mm day 1 while gpmsm2r and era5 present values of 0 156 mm day 1 and 0 152 mm day 1 respectively although median values indicate an overall overestimation for satellite rainfall products there is high spatial variability across the whole country fig 5d 5e and 5f show that the validation period presented similar spatial patterns of the calibration period for brazilian catchments with the highest values in the southern portion the values of mrmse q are close to those obtained in the calibration period being 0 888 mm day 1 0 708 mm day 1 and 1 026 mm day 1 for sm2rain gpmsm2r and era5 respectively nse q from the era5 product mnse q 0 161 is considerably lower than those obtained for the daily river discharge estimated with satellite rainfall as inputs gmpsm2r shows the best performance with 40 of the catchments with nse 0 5 and mnse q 0 418 sm2rasc and era5 present similar results with mnse q 0 204 and mnse q 0 161 respectively and 21 of the catchments with nse q 0 5 in terms of kge satellite rainfall products also perform better than the era5 rainfall product employing the sm2rasc as input for modeling daily river discharge we obtain 52 of the catchments with kge 0 5 in the validation period with mkge q 0 510 gpmsm2r is slightly better with mkge q 0 574 and 61 of the catchments with kge q 0 5 the worst performance overall is achieved by the era5 product mkge q 0 487 even though 48 of the catchments with kge q 0 5 as expected the general performance scores of the hydrological modeling in simulating the river discharge in brazilian catchments decrease from the calibration to the validation period as illustrated in fig 6 the median bias q of the era5 product slightly increases while the satellite rainfall products present a decrease it is also clear to note that the range of the bias q is considerably increased in the validation period the range of rmse q is slightly increased in the validation period for all products analyzed while the median of rmse q mrmse q is diminished for era5 and sm2rasc and improved for gpmsm2r nse q and kge q present a significant reduction of their values indicating that hydrological modeling has a great dependency on the observed data important to note that we used a relatively short series for calibration and validation and the results might be better with longer series nonetheless median values of kge q are mostly 0 5 even though the performance of the daily river discharge modeling is not satisfactory for all the catchments analyzed here the satellite rainfall products showed their ability to be a reliable tool in different hydroclimatic conditions of brazil in fig 7 we show the kge as a function of the catchment size through our set of 520 catchments for the subset of catchments with areas smaller than 1 000 km2 many of them perform very well kge q 0 5 with a small group presenting negative values the same pattern is noted for the catchments with areas varying between 10 000 km2 and 100 000 km2 while for those with a range of 1 000 km2 10 000 km2 some catchments are presenting extremely poor performance kge q 0 for the group of large catchments 100 000 km2 we can note that a larger percentage presents negative values of kge indicating that the model was not capable of capturing the main features of streamflow generation in those catchments even though most of these catchments present good performance as in jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 we also did not find a clear pattern between catchment size and model product performance four specific examples of catchments with distinct characteristics of rainfall temperature and river discharge regimes are shown in fig 8 fig 8a and 8b are related to the óbidos streamflow monitoring a catchment with 4 800 000 km2 in the amazon river basin with large amounts of annual precipitation and low interannual variability of precipitation as can be seen the misdc model showed a good agreement with all the products kge q 0 88 and this was carried for the validation period with kge q 0 77 modeling results for the araguantins station are shown in fig 8c and 8d this station is in the tocantins araguaia river basin in the cerrado biome which has a great impact on evapotranspiration and groundwater withdraws for irrigations purposes our results demonstrate the high reliability of both satellite rainfall products and hydrological model to simulate daily river discharge under these conditions with kge 0 5 for calibration and validation periods fig 8e and 8f in turn are related to the vila urucuia monitoring station in the cerrado biome which has well defined rainy and dry seasons with long periods of streamflow recession in this catchment gpmsm2r performs better than sm2rasc and era5 in the calibration with kge q 0 90 while sm2rasc with kge q 0 77 performs better in the validation the last catchment results are shown in fig 8g and 8h for the campos ponte municipal streamflow gauge related to the paraíba do sul river basin this catchment is especially important due to its role as a water supplier for the most populous regions of brazil including the metropolitan areas of são paulo and rio de janeiro providing water for 14 million people the calibration period generates much better values of kge q than the validation but it is still possible to estimate the river discharge with reliability in the validation period with remote sensing products kge q 0 56 simulations with sm2rasc and gpmsm2r are also able to capture the 2014 2015 megadrought in são paulo escobar 2015 with signs of decreasing river discharge since previous years this fact reinforces the importance of hydrologic modeling using remote sensing products to support water management agents our results are in accordance with those found by camici et al 2020 for european basins also using the misdc and the sm2rasc as the precipitation input they found a mkge q 0 722 and mkge q 0 569 for a subset of 1318 catchments in the calibration and validations periods respectively in turn our results for the calibration and the validation are mkge q 0 748 and mkge q 0 510 for the sm2rasc as input in hydrological modeling even though we cannot directly compare the performance score results due to methodological differences it is possible to correlate the good performance of the gpmsm2r in this study and in that conducted for a subset of african basins brocca et al 2020 in which this rainfall product outperformed other rainfall products in estimating daily river flow discharge with mkge q 0 8 in mnse q terms our results of sm2rasc performance are slightly worse than those found by camici et al 2018 for italy but we have used a larger subset of catchments and a longer time series during calibration and validation although there is a clear advantage of forcing the hydrological model with the ground based rainfall product against satellite and reanalysis rainfall products in catchments in southern and southeastern brazil it is clear the added value of the satellite rainfall products in simulating estimating the daily river in regions with low density of rain gauge stations such as northern brazil amazon discharge by observing the skill scores results presented in fig 9 when comparing only the non ground based data bottom up satellite rainfall products present more reliability on estimating river discharge than reanalysis data as we can see in fig 8d wherein 383 catchments is better to use sm2rain ascat 260 catchments or gpm sm2rain 123 catchments products than the era5 and 137 catchments in which is preferable to employ the era5 data aside from our results it is possible to find robust performance of these products over different areas of the globe with distinct climatic and geophysical conditions such as brazil africa and europe allowing a reliable and continuous river discharge monitoring 5 3 reliability of remote sensing products on hydrologic signatures the reliability of the ground based sm2rasc gpmsm2r and era5 rainfall products to simulate hydrologic signatures in brazilian biomes in terms of coefficient of determination is shown in fig 10 in terms of determination coefficient between observed and estimated signatures for all catchments in each biome additionally we present a qualitative analysis based on a performance ranking on the right side we highlight here the good ability of products to estimate the hydrologic signatures mean q q5 and q95 related to the magnitude of river discharge frequency and duration of low flows and high flows are poorly simulated by rainfall products through bfi and hfd are well represented while the fdc slope and 7 day minimum q are not correctly represented from the knowledge that high low flows are in some cases more important than normal flows it is important to note that the model estimations did not perform satisfactorily for all the catchments and the employment of the misdc model combined with the rainfall products ground based satellite or reanalysis should be carefully taken this is probably due to the lack of streamflow generation process by the model which was developed for different physical and geomorphological conditions of brazilian catchments overall the satellite based products sm2rasc and gpmsm2r are better predictors for hydrologic signatures than counterpart ground based for the atlantic forest cerrado and caatinga biomes on the other hand ground based rainfall product performs better in the pampa where there is no well defined seasonal cycle the performance between products was similar in the amazon biome with the satellite based rainfall products being better predictors for mean and low flows signatures and the ground based rainfall product being a better predictor for high flows baseflow and timing of river discharge the era5 rainfall product presented a satisfactory performance achieving better results than ground based products in atlantic forest cerrado and caatinga biomes 6 conclusions in this study we evaluated the performance of three rainfall products in estimating daily precipitation over brazil the satellite based bottom up sm2rain ascat the satellite based bottom up plus top down gpm sm2rain and the reanalysis based era5 additionally we assessed the suitability of these products in simulating the daily river discharge and hydrologic signatures in brazilian catchments we used a subset of 520 catchments from the cabra dataset and the hydrologic modeling was carried out using the misdc hydrologic model the performance evaluation was executed by the employment of statistical scores such as the bias root mean squared error nash sutcliffe efficiency and kling gupta efficiency the performance of the satellite based products in simulating daily precipitation over brazil was better than era5 for five of six biomes sm2rain ascat presented the lowest bias values while gpm sm2rain presented the lowest values of rmse daily river discharge was also better modeled with sm2rain ascat and gpm sm2rain in terms of kge during calibration all products presented low values of bias and 82 of catchments have median values of kge 0 5 performance scores were slightly worsened in the validation but are still able to estimate daily river discharge with great accuracy mkge 0 5 finally satellite rainfall products performed well in estimating hydrologic signatures of brazilian catchments being better predictors than ground based observations for atlantic forest cerrado and caatinga biomes aside from being as good as ground based rainfall product in the amazon our study shows that there is an added value when using products like sm2rain ascat and gpm sm2rain in tropical catchments like those in brazil the employment of near real time satellite based rainfall products in hydrologic extremes analysis such as floods and droughts improves the capacity of impact mitigation of these extremes irrigation on agricultural lands could be done with sustainable use of water resources social and economic impacts caused by floods could be mitigated and a better understanding of water fluxes could be achieved on multiple spatial and temporal scales definitively satellite based rainfall products are a valuable tool for data scarce regions due to their

4167,satellite rainfall products are one of the most valuable tools for water resources monitoring in data scarce regions due to their low latency and quasi global range however there are still uncertainties associated with rainfall products performance used to estimate hydrologic signatures in several regions such as brazil here we investigate the performance of three rainfall products in estimating daily precipitation daily river discharge and hydrologic signatures over brazil the sm2rain ascat and the gpm sm2rain satellite products and the era5 reanalysis product we used a subset of 520 catchments from the catchments attributes for brazil cabra dataset and the hydrologic modeling was carried out using the misdc hydrologic model satellite based products performed better than era5 for most brazilian biomes in estimating daily precipitation when compared with ground observations used as reference daily river discharge was also better modeled with sm2rain ascat and gpm sm2rain hydrologic modeling presented low values of bias and 80 of catchments with kge 0 5 in calibration lastly hydrologic signatures were well estimated by sm2rain ascat and gpm sm2rain and for some biomes atlantic forest cerrado and caatinga they are better predictors than ground based observations we showed that there is a significant added value when using sm2rain ascat and gpm sm2rain products in tropical catchments allowing a high quality continuous water resources monitoring even in data scarce regions besides our findings pave the way for a better understanding of hydrologic extremes droughts and floods using these satellite rainfall products on multiple spatial and temporal scales keywords satellite climate streamflow catchments hydrologic signatures 1 introduction precipitation is a prerequisite for human life and development and its monitoring is crucial for several applications in many fields such as hydrology climatology geology and agriculture it is of great interest for understanding earth s system as a whole barrett and beaumont 1994 as it is considered the most important variable in geosciences maggioni and massari 2018 due to its high spatio temporal variability it is a hard variable to measure with a considerable uncertainty associated and the ground based rainfall monitoring generally suffers from a lack of station s density especially in developing countries barrett and beaumont 1994 brocca et al 2020 xavier et al 2016 among the alternative options to ground based stations currently available for precipitation monitoring weather prediction models weather radar and satellite based observations the satellite based products are the most comprehensive and viable and sometimes the unique source of information with low cost and easy access for users in data scarce regions brocca et al 2019 camici et al 2020 massari et al 2020 wagner et al 2012 products like the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm have been extensively used worldwide and it is one of the most known satellite rainfall products huffman et al 2007 the bottom up approach for precipitation monitoring arose in recent years and uses the soil moisture of soil to estimate and improve the precipitation over land contrary to the conventional and most commonly used approach top down brocca et al 2014 a set of papers using the kalman filter kf and satellite soil moisture have been published crow et al 2009 crow and ryu 2009 crow and zhan 2007 showing improvements in rainfall and streamflow estimates pellarin et al 2009 pellarin et al 2013 adopted an antecedent precipitation index api constrained with the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos amsr e to improve trmm satellite based rainfall product recently brocca et al 2019 presented a new satellite based rainfall product based on soil moisture the sm2rain ascat this product is based on the implementation of the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2014 to soil moisture observations from the advanced scatterometer ascat unlike the previous ones the sm2rain ascat is a rainfall product estimated with soil moisture and not corrected by soil moisture the sm2rain based rainfall products were also combined with the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg resulting in an enhanced product named gpm sm2rain massari et al 2020 the sm2rain ascat and gpm sm2rain are the most advanced satellite based rainfall products that use the bottom up approach so far both are low latency 1 day with a global range that may be useful for continuous monitoring of water resources despite the facility and advantages of using the satellite based rainfall products we must keep in mind that still have uncertainties associated brocca et al 2014 and these uncertainties are transferred to the applications such as hydrological modeling thus it is important to assess not only the reliability of estimating precipitation but also the suitability for river discharge simulation or any other application as done in brocca et al 2020 brunetti et al 2021 and camici et al 2020 for instance brunetti et al 2021 employed the sm2rain ascat and the gpm products and their integration to perform landslide forecasting in india establishing that the satellite rainfall products generally outperform ground based observations in this goal hydrological signatures are important indicators to provide an understanding of the hydrological functionality and behavior of a catchment sawicz et al 2011 because of this the hydrologic signatures can also be used as indicators of hydrologic modeling ability in simulate catchment s responses variability euser et al 2013 therefore if a combination of rainfall product and hydrologic model can provide accurate hydrologic signatures it is a good indicator of product model capability to reproduce the hydrological behavior of a catchment brazil is a country covering almost 50 of south america s area presenting heterogeneous hydrological climatic and geophysical attributes it should be underlined that between 12 and 18 of the world s renewable freshwater flows in brazilian rivers rodrigues et al 2015 unep and ana 2007 despite being one of the most important countries to the global water fluxes brazil has a scarce allocation of funding for hydro meteorological monitoring which creates great challenges for proper knowledge of its water resources including precipitation there is a lack of gauge stations for precipitation monitoring as shown in xavier et al 2016 with stations density lower than recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo making the satellite rainfall products an important tool for water resources monitoring in brazil some studies have been carried out to evaluate the performance of sm2rain based rainfall products in brazil paredes trejo et al 2018 evaluated the performance of sm2rain cci ciabatta et al 2018 product to simulate rainfall characteristics and temporal distribution over northeastern brazil showing quite good performance on daily estimations later paredes trejo et al 2019 expanded the previous analysis for entire brazil and found that sm2rain based products cci and ascat can be effectively used for water resources and agricultural purposes on a daily scale however none of the abovementioned studies address broader applications of the satellite rainfall products such as river discharge and hydrologic signatures estimations across the country thus the performance of hydrological applications of satellite based rainfall products that use a bottom up approach is still unknown for brazilian catchments to our knowledge this is the first study evaluating and validating the performance of the bottom up satellite rainfall products in simulating daily river discharge and hydrologic signatures for brazilian catchments thus the objective of this study is to assess the performance of the sm2rain ascat and gpm sm2rain rainfall products in simulating daily precipitation in brazil for that at the catchment scale the sm2rain based products are compared with ground based observations used as a reference and the performance is evaluated against a widely used reanalysis rainfall product era5 hersbach et al 2020 moreover the hydrological application of these data in simulating daily river discharge on 520 brazilian catchments is investigated we have used a large sample catchment attributes dataset the catchment attributes for brazil cabra to calibrate and validate the simulations of the misdc hydrological model brocca et al 2011 2 study area our study adopts 520 catchments in brazil as case studies they are located in six different biomes throughout brazil amazon atlantic forest cerrado caatinga pampa and pantanal see fig 1 brazil has continental dimensions with 8 500 000 km2 ranging from longitudes 34 w to 73 w and latitudes 6 n to 34 s catchment areas range from 22 to 4 800 000 km2 covering a wide range of climate patterns land use geology and soil types according to almagro et al 2020b precipitation in brazil ranges from 400 mm year 1 in the caatinga which is a semi arid region comprised mostly by secondary vegetation herbaceous and arboreous with a severe dry season to 4 000 mm year 1 in the amazon the largest tropical biome in the world consisting of a densely vegetated rainforest high values of precipitation are also observed in the atlantic forest characterized by rainforest cover in the coastal area and the semi deciduous forest in the continental intermediate amounts of precipitation 1 500 to 2 500 mm year 1 are observed in the cerrado woodlands and savanna the pantanal one of the largest flooded areas in the world and in the pampa biome predominance of natural pastures with tree formations and sparse shrub 3 datasets 3 1 ground observations to evaluate the bottom up remote sensing precipitation products we used a gridded interpolated product derived from observations developed by xavier et al 2016 for entire brazil as a ground truth reference this product used observed precipitation data and many other climatic variables derived from approximately 4 000 rain gauges from the brazilian water agency ana the national institute of meteorology inmet and the water and electric energy department of são paulo state daee sp presenting a 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution and covering the 1980 2015 period moreover this reference dataset has been extensively applied in previous studies such as evaluation of remote sensing products melo et al 2015 paredes trejo et al 2018 paredes trejo and barbosa 2017 paredes trejo et al 2017 vegetation response to rainfall variability souza et al 2016 impacts of climatic extremes melo et al 2016 and climate change historical simulations and projections almagro et al 2017 2020 avila diaz et al 2020 the xavier s dataset can be accessed through http careyking com data downloads the observed river discharge for the brazilian catchments is derived from the catchment attributes for brazil cabra dataset developed by almagro et al 2021 the cabra dataset is a large sample dataset of catchment attributes for 735 catchments in brazil the authors collected synthesized organized and made available a set of 100 catchment attributes for eight main classes topography climate streamflow groundwater soil geology land cover and hydrological disturbance due to the continental scale of brazil there is high heterogeneity in the hydrological behavior of the catchments cabra provides daily river discharge for each of its catchments which was obtained from the ana covering the hydrological period from 1980 to 2010 with high quality records 10 of missing data moreover cabra river discharge data were quality checked for inconsistencies and outliers the cabra dataset is available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 4070146 to increase the performance evaluation reliability we have extended the time series of river discharge from the cabra dataset to overlap the whole period of satellite monitoring so the cabra dataset used in this study is an updated version of the published one covering the 2007 2018 period 3 2 rainfall products in this study we adopted three different precipitation products to conduct the performance on precipitation estimates and hydrological modeling two of them are satellite derived sm2rain ascat and the gpm sm2rain the last one is derived from reanalysis data the era5 the first remote sensing product used in this study is sm2rain ascat sm2rain ascat is a gridded rainfall dataset based on soil moisture which is commonly called as bottom up method the sm2rain algorithm is based on the inversion of the soil water balance equation to estimate the amount of water entering the soil by using soil moisture as input sm2rain ascat rainfall product uses the satellite observations of soil moisture data from the advanced scatterometer ascat carried by three satellites from the metop family the sm2rain ascat precipitation product was developed by brocca et al 2019 presents a spatial resolution of 12 5 km and its latest release covers the 2007 2020 period sm2rain ascat has been extensively tested and applied throughout the world since its release and appears as a valuable product for short latency rainfall monitoring sm2rain ascat is referred to here as sm2rasc and version 1 2 used in the study can be download at https zenodo org record 3635932 the second satellite rainfall product used here is gpm sm2rain this product is a short latency daily 25 km satellite based rainfall product generated by integrating the imerg er and sm2rain products it was developed by massari et al 2020 by using the optimal linear combination olc approach bishop and abramowitz 2013 which optimally merges multiple estimates from the same climatological variable rainfall in this case by minimizing the error with a calibration dataset the era5 gpm sm2rain covers the 2007 2018 period is referred to here as gpmsm2r and is available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 3345322 the third precipitation product used in our study is the era5 reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 era5 is the latest version of climate reanalysis data from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and provides hourly daily and monthly data on several atmospheric sea and land variables as a reanalysis dataset era5 employs past observations and models to generate accurate and consistent time series of climate variables and parameters being one of the most widely used datasets in geosciences era5 precipitation is available at 36 km spatial resolution from 1950 to the present here we also make use of the era5 s temperature product for the hydrological modeling input era5 products can be explored and downloaded through the copernicus climate data store https cds climate copernicus eu 4 methodology 4 1 hydrologic modeling to perform the hydrologic modeling we have used the modello idrologico semi distribuito in continuo misdc brocca et al 2011 which is a semi distributed continuous rainfall runoff model the misdc is a parsimonious and reliable rainfall runoff model to estimate the total streamflow considering the wetness conditions of the soil before the rainfall event to calibrate its nine parameters table 1 the misdc solves the objective function to maximize the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 between the simulated and observed river discharge the calibration period was taken in the first 7 years of data jan 2007 to mar 2014 with a warm up period of one year while the validation period englobes the apr 2014 to dec 2018 period misdc model has been widely used in recent years brocca et al 2020 conducted a study in 10 catchments in europe west africa and south africa and found that the remote sensing products outperform the gauge based rainfall products in simulating daily river discharge for western africa catchments in europe camici et al 2020 tested the accuracy of different satellite rainfall products against observations for 1318 catchments covering 23 countries using misdc the authors found that sm2rain ascat is the most reliable product for river discharge simulation across europe to minimize the uncertainties of the hydrological modeling we filtered the total number of catchments selecting only those with long and consistent series from the extended version of the cabra dataset almagro et al 2021 we have applied the following criteria only perennial catchments with data covering all the observation period of the remote sensing products 12 years from jan 2007 to dec 2018 and with 5 of missing data this procedure reduced the number of catchments from 735 to 520 covering five of six brazilian biomes 4 2 hydrologic signatures to assess the long term reliability of the satellite rainfall products we calculated a series of hydrological signatures that quantifies the hydrological characteristics providing a better understanding of hydrological behavior these signatures can be used to explain the catchment s variability in responses to climate forcings we calculated for the 520 catchments a subset of 11 hydrological signatures for the sm2rasc gpmsm2r era5 and the ground based reference product related to the magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change of river discharge sawicz et al 2011 and westerberg and mcmillan 2015 listed in table 2 the calculation of the hydrological series was carried out using the toolbox for streamflow signatures in hydrology tossh developed by gnann et al 2021 4 3 performance evaluation on precipitation estimates and hydrologic modeling to evaluate the performance and quality of simulated precipitation against the observed data product during an overlap period 2007 2015 between them we used the following statistical metrics bias bias root mean squared error rmse and correlation coefficient cc eqs 1 3 1 bias 1 n i 1 n p sim i p obs i p obs i 2 cc n i 1 n p sim i p obs i i 1 n p sim i i 1 n p obs i n i 1 n p sim i 2 i 1 n p sim i 2 n i 1 n p obs i 2 i 1 n p obs i 2 3 rmse i 1 n p obs i p sim i 2 n where p is the long term mean precipitation from observations obs and simulations sim σ is the standard deviation of the annual precipitation n is the number of points for each biome to the river discharge simulations we have included two more widely used performance metrics to calibrate and evaluate hydrologic models with observed data the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 described in eqs 4 and 5 both metrics might be interpreted in the same way but with different approaches the closer to 1 is the nse and kge the better is the agreement between

are presented in fig 2 the sm2rasc bias of daily precipitation is close to zero in almost all brazilian biomes with exception of the amazon where it shows overestimation in central amazon and underestimation in western and eastern portions the bias presented by the merged product gpmsm2r is slightly greater than sm2rasc but still with most of the areas with values close to zero on the other hand the era5 rainfall product follows the same pattern of sm2rasc underestimating overestimating the precipitation in all amazon and close to zero bias on most of brazil in rmse spatial analysis sm2rasc and gpmsm2r perform similarly and the era5 product presents the highest values up to 10 mm day 1 the correlation coefficient presents better performance in satellite rainfall products than in era5 products with the highest values in amazon pampa and caatinga showing its high reliability on estimating the precipitation in different regions of brazil with different climates and seasonal cycles the added value of satellite rainfall products in relation to era5 can be seen in the radar chart in all regions and biomes of brazil fig 3 and table 3 the radar chart allows us to infer what is the most suitable product by the area of the polygon since better values of each performance skill are converging to the center of the chart the lower the polygon s area the better is the product represented by this polygon for almost all biomes on average the satellite rainfall products perform better than the era5 estimations the exception is the caatinga where era5 presents the best performances in the area averaged values of bias and rmse referred to as abias and armse 5 2 streamflow estimates on brazilian catchments the performance of the sm2rasc gpmsm2r and era5 rainfall products in simulating the river discharge of brazilian catchments during the calibration period carried from jan 2007 to mar 2014 from the misdc hydrological model is illustrated in fig 4 all products present a close to zero mean daily river discharge bias bias q in most of the catchments with some overestimated values in the southern portion and underestimated values in the northeastern part especially in the são francisco river basin this is probably due to the large reservoir s regulation capacity and due to the groundwater exploration in this region as shown in almagro et al 2021 and lucas et al 2021 which is not taken into account in the hydrological modeling on median terms mbias q the gpmsm2r and era5 present best performances with absolute mbias q 0 001 mm day 1 followed by the sm2rasc mbias q 0 006 mm day 1 spatial variability of mean daily river discharge root mean squared error rmse q shows a similar pattern and median values ranging from 0 780 to 0 923 mm day 1 with rmse q 2 mm day 1 for 80 of the catchments the highest values of rmse q are found for the southern region in the pampa biome reaching up to 5 mm day 1 the mean nash sutcliffe efficiency for daily river discharge nse q demonstrates a better performance of gpmsm2r against other products analyzed here with median value of 0 614 and 68 of the catchments with nse q 0 5 considering the sm2rasc and era5 products we found median values of nse q mnse q of 0 501 and 0 453 and 51 and 42 of the catchments with nse q 0 5 in terms of the kling gupta efficiency on daily river discharge kge q all products perform well with median values mkge q higher than 0 7 sm2rasc presented kge q 0 5 in 82 of the catchments mkge q 0 748 while in gpmsm2r and era5 there were 92 mkge q 0 807 and 85 mkge q 0 727 respectively values of kge q 0 5 in the southern portion of brazil should be attributed to the absence of a well defined seasonality of precipitation in this region which is important to establish a temporal correlation between observations and simulations another point to note is the poor performance in terms of nse q and kge q for some catchments in the caatinga biome in northeastern brazil we can explain the poor performance by the large number of reservoirs in catchments located in this region which again is not taken in account in the hydrological modeling in fig 5 the results of performance scores on the validation period carried from apr 2014 to dec 2018 from the hydrological modeling are shown the same color scheme from the calibration period was kept for a direct comparison between modeling phases the bias q from all rainfall products presents higher values than the calibration period keeping the characteristic of underestimation in the southern portion in the pampa biome sm2rasc presents mbias q value of 0 178 mm day 1 while gpmsm2r and era5 present values of 0 156 mm day 1 and 0 152 mm day 1 respectively although median values indicate an overall overestimation for satellite rainfall products there is high spatial variability across the whole country fig 5d 5e and 5f show that the validation period presented similar spatial patterns of the calibration period for brazilian catchments with the highest values in the southern portion the values of mrmse q are close to those obtained in the calibration period being 0 888 mm day 1 0 708 mm day 1 and 1 026 mm day 1 for sm2rain gpmsm2r and era5 respectively nse q from the era5 product mnse q 0 161 is considerably lower than those obtained for the daily river discharge estimated with satellite rainfall as inputs gmpsm2r shows the best performance with 40 of the catchments with nse 0 5 and mnse q 0 418 sm2rasc and era5 present similar results with mnse q 0 204 and mnse q 0 161 respectively and 21 of the catchments with nse q 0 5 in terms of kge satellite rainfall products also perform better than the era5 rainfall product employing the sm2rasc as input for modeling daily river discharge we obtain 52 of the catchments with kge 0 5 in the validation period with mkge q 0 510 gpmsm2r is slightly better with mkge q 0 574 and 61 of the catchments with kge q 0 5 the worst performance overall is achieved by the era5 product mkge q 0 487 even though 48 of the catchments with kge q 0 5 as expected the general performance scores of the hydrological modeling in simulating the river discharge in brazilian catchments decrease from the calibration to the validation period as illustrated in fig 6 the median bias q of the era5 product slightly increases while the satellite rainfall products present a decrease it is also clear to note that the range of the bias q is considerably increased in the validation period the range of rmse q is slightly increased in the validation period for all products analyzed while the median of rmse q mrmse q is diminished for era5 and sm2rasc and improved for gpmsm2r nse q and kge q present a significant reduction of their values indicating that hydrological modeling has a great dependency on the observed data important to note that we used a relatively short series for calibration and validation and the results might be better with longer series nonetheless median values of kge q are mostly 0 5 even though the performance of the daily river discharge modeling is not satisfactory for all the catchments analyzed here the satellite rainfall products showed their ability to be a reliable tool in different hydroclimatic conditions of brazil in fig 7 we show the kge as a function of the catchment size through our set of 520 catchments for the subset of catchments with areas smaller than 1 000 km2 many of them perform very well kge q 0 5 with a small group presenting negative values the same pattern is noted for the catchments with areas varying between 10 000 km2 and 100 000 km2 while for those with a range of 1 000 km2 10 000 km2 some catchments are presenting extremely poor performance kge q 0 for the group of large catchments 100 000 km2 we can note that a larger percentage presents negative values of kge indicating that the model was not capable of capturing the main features of streamflow generation in those catchments even though most of these catchments present good performance as in jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 we also did not find a clear pattern between catchment size and model product performance four specific examples of catchments with distinct characteristics of rainfall temperature and river discharge regimes are shown in fig 8 fig 8a and 8b are related to the óbidos streamflow monitoring a catchment with 4 800 000 km2 in the amazon river basin with large amounts of annual precipitation and low interannual variability of precipitation as can be seen the misdc model showed a good agreement with all the products kge q 0 88 and this was carried for the validation period with kge q 0 77 modeling results for the araguantins station are shown in fig 8c and 8d this station is in the tocantins araguaia river basin in the cerrado biome which has a great impact on evapotranspiration and groundwater withdraws for irrigations purposes our results demonstrate the high reliability of both satellite rainfall products and hydrological model to simulate daily river discharge under these conditions with kge 0 5 for calibration and validation periods fig 8e and 8f in turn are related to the vila urucuia monitoring station in the cerrado biome which has well defined rainy and dry seasons with long periods of streamflow recession in this catchment gpmsm2r performs better than sm2rasc and era5 in the calibration with kge q 0 90 while sm2rasc with kge q 0 77 performs better in the validation the last catchment results are shown in fig 8g and 8h for the campos ponte municipal streamflow gauge related to the paraíba do sul river basin this catchment is especially important due to its role as a water supplier for the most populous regions of brazil including the metropolitan areas of são paulo and rio de janeiro providing water for 14 million people the calibration period generates much better values of kge q than the validation but it is still possible to estimate the river discharge with reliability in the validation period with remote sensing products kge q 0 56 simulations with sm2rasc and gpmsm2r are also able to capture the 2014 2015 megadrought in são paulo escobar 2015 with signs of decreasing river discharge since previous years this fact reinforces the importance of hydrologic modeling using remote sensing products to support water management agents our results are in accordance with those found by camici et al 2020 for european basins also using the misdc and the sm2rasc as the precipitation input they found a mkge q 0 722 and mkge q 0 569 for a subset of 1318 catchments in the calibration and validations periods respectively in turn our results for the calibration and the validation are mkge q 0 748 and mkge q 0 510 for the sm2rasc as input in hydrological modeling even though we cannot directly compare the performance score results due to methodological differences it is possible to correlate the good performance of the gpmsm2r in this study and in that conducted for a subset of african basins brocca et al 2020 in which this rainfall product outperformed other rainfall products in estimating daily river flow discharge with mkge q 0 8 in mnse q terms our results of sm2rasc performance are slightly worse than those found by camici et al 2018 for italy but we have used a larger subset of catchments and a longer time series during calibration and validation although there is a clear advantage of forcing the hydrological model with the ground based rainfall product against satellite and reanalysis rainfall products in catchments in southern and southeastern brazil it is clear the added value of the satellite rainfall products in simulating estimating the daily river in regions with low density of rain gauge stations such as northern brazil amazon discharge by observing the skill scores results presented in fig 9 when comparing only the non ground based data bottom up satellite rainfall products present more reliability on estimating river discharge than reanalysis data as we can see in fig 8d wherein 383 catchments is better to use sm2rain ascat 260 catchments or gpm sm2rain 123 catchments products than the era5 and 137 catchments in which is preferable to employ the era5 data aside from our results it is possible to find robust performance of these products over different areas of the globe with distinct climatic and geophysical conditions such as brazil africa and europe allowing a reliable and continuous river discharge monitoring 5 3 reliability of remote sensing products on hydrologic signatures the reliability of the ground based sm2rasc gpmsm2r and era5 rainfall products to simulate hydrologic signatures in brazilian biomes in terms of coefficient of determination is shown in fig 10 in terms of determination coefficient between observed and estimated signatures for all catchments in each biome additionally we present a qualitative analysis based on a performance ranking on the right side we highlight here the good ability of products to estimate the hydrologic signatures mean q q5 and q95 related to the magnitude of river discharge frequency and duration of low flows and high flows are poorly simulated by rainfall products through bfi and hfd are well represented while the fdc slope and 7 day minimum q are not correctly represented from the knowledge that high low flows are in some cases more important than normal flows it is important to note that the model estimations did not perform satisfactorily for all the catchments and the employment of the misdc model combined with the rainfall products ground based satellite or reanalysis should be carefully taken this is probably due to the lack of streamflow generation process by the model which was developed for different physical and geomorphological conditions of brazilian catchments overall the satellite based products sm2rasc and gpmsm2r are better predictors for hydrologic signatures than counterpart ground based for the atlantic forest cerrado and caatinga biomes on the other hand ground based rainfall product performs better in the pampa where there is no well defined seasonal cycle the performance between products was similar in the amazon biome with the satellite based rainfall products being better predictors for mean and low flows signatures and the ground based rainfall product being a better predictor for high flows baseflow and timing of river discharge the era5 rainfall product presented a satisfactory performance achieving better results than ground based products in atlantic forest cerrado and caatinga biomes 6 conclusions in this study we evaluated the performance of three rainfall products in estimating daily precipitation over brazil the satellite based bottom up sm2rain ascat the satellite based bottom up plus top down gpm sm2rain and the reanalysis based era5 additionally we assessed the suitability of these products in simulating the daily river discharge and hydrologic signatures in brazilian catchments we used a subset of 520 catchments from the cabra dataset and the hydrologic modeling was carried out using the misdc hydrologic model the performance evaluation was executed by the employment of statistical scores such as the bias root mean squared error nash sutcliffe efficiency and kling gupta efficiency the performance of the satellite based products in simulating daily precipitation over brazil was better than era5 for five of six biomes sm2rain ascat presented the lowest bias values while gpm sm2rain presented the lowest values of rmse daily river discharge was also better modeled with sm2rain ascat and gpm sm2rain in terms of kge during calibration all products presented low values of bias and 82 of catchments have median values of kge 0 5 performance scores were slightly worsened in the validation but are still able to estimate daily river discharge with great accuracy mkge 0 5 finally satellite rainfall products performed well in estimating hydrologic signatures of brazilian catchments being better predictors than ground based observations for atlantic forest cerrado and caatinga biomes aside from being as good as ground based rainfall product in the amazon our study shows that there is an added value when using products like sm2rain ascat and gpm sm2rain in tropical catchments like those in brazil the employment of near real time satellite based rainfall products in hydrologic extremes analysis such as floods and droughts improves the capacity of impact mitigation of these extremes irrigation on agricultural lands could be done with sustainable use of water resources social and economic impacts caused by floods could be mitigated and a better understanding of water fluxes could be achieved on multiple spatial and temporal scales definitively satellite based rainfall products are a valuable tool for data scarce regions due to their low latency and global land range allowing continuous and high quality water resources monitoring credit authorship contribution statement andré almagro conceptualization methodology software formal

4168,the capillary fringe cf is the last barrier for groundwater protection studies investigating the effects of cyclic groundwater fluctuation on nitrogen transformations a critical biogenic element in soil systems received less attention relative to near surface and groundwater processes we conducted an experiment in a highly instrumented 91 cm sandy soil column under five hydrologic regimes 1 stagnant system with a static water level 2 periodic pulsed infiltration with a constant water level and 3 groundwater fluctuation under three frequencies 6 12 18 day cycle under groundwater fluctuation regimes the soil column can be divided into four zones aerobic zone 10 30 cm hypoxic zone 40 50 cm anoxic zone 60 70 cm and anaerobic zone 80 100 cm the stable high eh occurred in the aerobic and hypoxic zones while the stable low eh appeared in the anaerobic zone the eh at the upper anoxic zone 60 cm appeared to show a strong cyclic pattern and the eh at the lower anoxic zone 70 cm gradually decreased until it reached values similar to the anaerobic zone nitrate overwhelmed other nitrogen species in the aerobic and hypoxic zones the lower boundary of the nitrate dominant zone was sensitive to the water level which means that oxygen supply depends on the water level fluctuation ammonium dominated the anoxic and anaerobic zones and the upper boundary of the high ammonium zone was constant which implies that denitrification reached the maximum capacity in the anaerobic zone the dominance of a single species in these zones suggests incomplete cycling of nitrogen in contrast nitrogen removal was enhanced with increasing frequency of groundwater fluctuation low total nitrogen concentration was observed at the hypoxic and anoxic zones boundary due to the co occurrence of nitrification and denitrification the ratio of dissolved organic carbon to dissolved inorganic nitrogen can indicate the relative strength of nitrification denitrification subsequently distinguish the zonation of nitrogen status in this soil system additionally ferrous sulfide particles accumulated at the anaerobic zone with intensified reducing condition which deserves more

operated in infiltration cycles 2 4 wet and 4 dry days and provided suggestions for the operation of sat sites silver et al 2018 used treated wastewater infiltration to study n cycling and the origin of nh 4 with cycles of drying 3 4 days and wetting 3 4 days in a short term and long term column experiment 140 and 615 days respectively their results suggested that a combination of dnra and denitrification occurred during the wetting phase of the cycle and nitrification occurred during the drying phase additionally the study suggested that introducing o2 into the subsurface is helpful to eliminate some nitrogen mass through nitrification during the drying phase and denitrification during the subsequent wetting phase ben moshe et al 2020 found that by adjusting the frequency and length of drying and rewetting n transformations can be somewhat controlled both spatially depth and temporally while studies that focus on cyclic top n input with variable frequencies are common those that investigated the effects of cyclic water level fluctuation in soil systems are less frequent in the field scale hefting et al 2004 monitored several riparian zones with a fluctuating water level and concluded that the water level was the dominant factor for the n dynamics and its end product ye et al 2012 studied n dynamics in the riparian systems the elevations of 145 m to 175 m in a reservoir region under two cycles of drying and wetting for two years and found soil inorganic n decreased in the lab scale sasikala et al 2009 conducted wetland mesocosms to investigate the effects of water level fluctuation on n dynamics and aeration conditions in soils their results showed n removal and aeration of the soil can be significantly improved by water level fluctuation additionally rezanezhad et al 2014 adopted cyclic water level fluctuation 20 days for the 45 cm deep unsaturated zone with the continuous and automated upward and downward flow 4 8 cm d to study soil biogeochemical processes but did not consider the effects on nitrogen furthermore with a similar experimental setup pronk et al 2020 found distinct organic carbon consumption in the fluctuation zone of the soil column which was driven by a more active rather than more diverse microbial community while a suitable amount of knowledge exists regarding the effect of different cyclic dynamic hydrologic regimes with top input on n dynamics in soil systems only a limited number of studies used cyclic groundwater fluctuation with different frequencies and durations to understand n transformations in soil systems furthermore the comparison of n dynamics under cyclic hydrologic regimes with different frequencies and durations between the top and bottom input in a single system is also lacking our main goal is to analyze redox sensitive processes i e n cycling at the capillary fringe cf in a deep soil column induced by hydrologic regimes with different frequencies specific objectives include 1 quantifying the range of the functional zones in the soil column and revealing their roles for n transformations under different hydrologic regimes and 2 assessing the impacts of redox distribution on predicting n transformations and associated redox processes under different hydrologic regimes we hypothesize that 1 under the cyclic oxic and anoxic conditions of the soil system nitrification occurs at the upper unsaturated zone and denitrification exists at the lower unsaturated zone and saturated zone 2 the midportion of the soil column which undergoes alternative drying and rewetting contributes to both aerobic and anaerobic redox processes 3 the range of the midportion of the soil column changes with the hydrologic regimes in a unique sandy soil column that is highly instrumented we have investigated n transformations under five different hydrologic regimes including static periodic pulsed recharge and three dynamic groundwater fluctuation regimes our focus here is understanding the involved n processes and their reflectance in the eh dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 column description the research is conducted in a rectangular perspex soil

experiment were conducted as follows fig 2 1 static water level water level was kept at 55 cm following water and gas sampling every 3 days water level recovery was made from the bottom 2 periodic pulsed recharge water level was kept at 55 cm after water and gas sampling every 3 or 4 days a pulse of water was introduced from the top at 4 5 ml min continuously to replace 15 water in the column in 5 h simultaneously a tube that was connected to the bottom of the column was used to drain the surplus water to a plastic bottle 3 1 3 3 groundwater fluctuation the water level was increased by 20 30 60 cm respectively every 3 or 4 days from 85 cm to 25 cm then the water level was decreased by 20 30 60 cm respectively every 3 or 4 days from 25 cm to 85 cm the sampling campaigns at the end of each water level manipulation extracted minimal volume of water that accounts for 7 of the porewater therefore it had only minor and short lived effect on the biogeochemical processes that can recover

discussed finally other redox processes fe mn p s are depicted to fulfill the evolution of soil biogeochemical processes in the soil column 3 1 eh dynamics 3 1 1 eh distributions in case 1 fig 3a following a stabilization period of about 15 days the eh at almost all depths became stable at 400 mv or slightly above this indicates either a decent supply of o2 at almost all depths or relatively low o2 demand on the other hand in case 2 fig 3b that in terms of the experiment is a continuation of case 1 the eh layering was observed after a similar stabilization time the main difference between cases 1 and 2 is the influent direction quantity and influent composition table s2 the top influent has higher concentrations of no 3 and nh 4 compared to the bottom influent this mild mixing and addition of nutrients are significant in the dynamics of the system close examination of the three different groundwater fluctuation cases cases 3 1 through 3 3 figs 3c e suggests that the upper parts of the soil column which were never fully saturated were virtually unaffected by the soil column operation and presented stable eh of 400 mv at the same time the lower depths were also mostly unaffected with the eh values at the 400 mv range with the exception of a short term increase when water was injected into or extracted out of the system the do in the bottom tank was 1 33 0 39 mg l this suggests that limited o2 in the influent 4 90 0 48 mg l was quickly consumed before it reached the upper depths in the groundwater fluctuation cases the water level can influence the o2 content in the headspace fig s1 si because o2 content has a linear relationship with the water content at 20 cm case 2 r2 0 31 case 3 1 r2 0 29 case 3 2 r2 0 20 case 3 3 r2 0 42 p 0 01 for all cases both drainage and imbibition can cause o2 content to decrease dramatically and recover gradually which was obvious in case 3 3 this phenomenon is related to the birch effect which is characterized by a burst in decomposition and mineralization along with the short term release of inorganic nitrogen and co2 upon rewetting during imbibition birch 1958 jarvis et al 2007 moyano et al 2013 this phenomenon occurs due to the increasing water content which connects pores and better enables labile organic matter om to be consumed by microbes and utilized for growth and respiration moyano et al 2013 during drainage o2 penetrated deeper into the soil column which stimulated the mineralization of om to co2 by soil microbes rezanezhad et al 2014 the upward movement of co2 was facilitated as the unsaturated portion of the soil expanded rezanezhad et al 2014 3 1 2 comparison of oxygen availability comparing cases 1 and 2 to the three different groundwater fluctuation cases cases 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 indicates similarity to case 2 in that the eh remained high in the shallow depths 400 mv low at the deepest end of the system 400 mv and in between in the more dynamic range this indicates o2 availability was close at the surface with limited o2 transfers to greater depths though the soil column was semi sealed it appears that the gaseous o2 was still sufficient to maintain oxidizing conditions in the unsaturated zone fig s1 the volumetric o2 content in the open atmosphere is 20 94 average volumetric o2 contents at the headspace from case 1 to case 3 3 were 17 51 16 96 17 62 17 81 and 17 77 respectively when considering o2 transfer through diffusion in both the gaseous and liquid phases these percentages make sense from a qualitative perspective the lower eh values in cases 2 and 3 when compared to case 1 suggest that mixing and om availability are important to consider we note that the reducing zone in case 3 all subcases was wider than that in case 2 and the carbon sources in cases 2 and 3 top and bottom sources respectively were similar which further support the importance of o2 availability in a system the average co2 concentration in the unsaturated zone at the lowest water level in each case was 3 762 ppm case 1 8 120 ppm case 2 13 186 ppm case 3 1 9 541 ppm case 3 2 and 10 093 ppm case 3 3 this indicates that both pulsed infiltration and groundwater fluctuation increase c respiration significantly in case 3 the intensity of c respiration did not show much variation except for case 3 1 this indicates that the difference in gas generation mostly appeared between cases not including subcases the exceptional high co2 concentration in case 3 1 is because the low water level water level wl 85 cm was much lower than that in case 2 wl 55 cm within this transition period of case 2 and case 3 a burst of co2 was released at the deep depth of the soil column which was exposed to the air for the first time the difference in co2 concentration between case 2 and case 3 was due to two reasons 1 expanded depth of the unsaturated zone and 2 more efficient o2 supply for respiration in the groundwater fluctuation case silver et al 2018 used 1 m height loamy sand column to study nitrogen infiltration with drying wetting cycles 3 4 days 3 4 days the water level was at 50 cm during the drying period they found the constant low eh 250 mv from 45 75 cm in case 2 the anaerobic condition can only be observed at 95 cm 500 mv in case 3 the low eh 400 mv zone can reach 70 cm comparing silver et al 2018 s results and our cases 2 and 3 it is suggested here that groundwater fluctuation can form anaerobic conditions more efficiently than the infiltration case both silver et al 2018 s and our results support the importance of o2 availability for the redox processes distribution in the subsurface 3 1 3 redox zonation the redox status of soils can be classified into four zones as follows mansfeldt 2003 oxidizing weakly reducing moderately reducing and strongly reducing conditions 400 200 to 400 100 to 200 and 100 mv respectively the main redox pairs in each zone can be found in the redox ladder zhang and furman 2021 based on this qualitative standard we divide the redox zones for each case fig 4 the classification of redox zonation is made by comparing all eh values at each depth of each case with the above criteria case 1 fig 3a was the beginning of the experiment so the redox zones did not obey the depth characteristic strictly in case 2 fig 3b the apparent transformation from oxidation to strong reduction was observed along the depth in case 3 figs 3c e a clear oxidizing zone was formed at 10 50 cm while the 70 100 cm depth was always in the strongly reducing range the regions around 60 cm in cases 3 2 and 3 3 were characterized by the changing eh regime according to the water level dynamics 3 1 4 conditions at the lower parts of the system in case 3 in all three groundwater fluctuation cases case 3 the lower end of the transition zone 60 70 cm showed more dynamic eh variation compared to the upper part 10 50 cm and the lower part 80 100 cm of the soil column this is to be expected as those depths shifted between unsaturated and saturated conditions the 60 cm data depicted much higher variation alternating between oxidizing conditions 400 mv and strongly reducing conditions 400 mv the 60 cm depth was at the boundary of unsaturated and saturated zones thus it is vulnerable to show the o2 availability from sections 3 2 and 3 3 below redox sensitive species no 3 nh 4 fe mn p s were in low concentration at this depth which means the dominant redox sensitive species can switch easily with the o2 availability the 70 cm data was generally tending to more reducing conditions and showed large variation for the beginning and ending in each case 436 330 mv the eh at 70 cm showed a gradually decreasing trend and eventually reached the same value as 80 cm in case 3 3 however the duration of the decreasing eh in case 3 1 and 3 2 can be estimated based on the trend based on the eh slope it is estimated to take 70 45 and 29 days for the eh at 70 cm to reach the stable values for cases 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 respectively this indicates that more frequent drying rewetting cycles form anaerobic conditions faster at 70 cm when the experiment was stopped at the end of each case and water was drained the low eh at 70 cm would immediately jump to the high eh values the 70 cm depth then needs another period of running to gradually reach anaerobic conditions this was to be expected as 70 cm was almost always very close to saturation fig s2 si both the high variability in the eh at 60 cm with water content at 50 cm fig s2 and the return of the eh at 70 cm suggests that gaseous o2 even with relatively low concentration was dominant over other o2 transfer mechanisms in the liquid phase diffusion and advection close examination of case 3 3 fig 3e suggests the eh at 60 cm at the beginning of ejection at low water level and the end of ejection at high water level rose from around 0 mv to 400 mv and 400 to 100 mv respectively this again supports the previous statement about the vulnerability of this depth to o2 availability interestingly the beginning of water injection to the system triggered a sharp eh increase to the 400 mv range followed by a slower decrease of the eh to the 400 mv range during drainage after a sharp increase to about 100 mv the eh remained stable it is important to note that these significant changes in the eh were associated with only about 8 8 change in water content from saturation of about 45 4 to 36 6 water content suggesting again that transport in the gaseous phase was dominant over the liquid phase transport even in very low aerated porosity furthermore there is a trend to extend the reducing conditions from 70 cm to 60 cm from cycle 1 to cycle 5 the stable eh at 60 cm at low water level decreased gradually 16 07 43 36 61 37 94 99 187 13 mv for cycles 4 and 5 fluctuation started to occur for the eh at the low water level simultaneously the eh at 70 cm had already reached the same value as 80 cm these two phenomenons hint that 60 cm started to approach to the reducing condition following the tracks of the eh at 70 cm in a 1 m column infiltration experiment silver et al 2018 found reducing condition was present at all the depths during the wetting period and the unsaturated zone 45 cm displayed large eh fluctuation during the drying period in another 2 m column infiltration experiment zhang et al 2018 a clear aerobic zone with constant high eh 25 cm a hypoxic zone with fluctuating high eh 40 cm an anoxic zone with fluctuating low eh 65 cm and an anaerobic zone with constant low eh 95 145 cm can be distinguished due to the eh values in our experiment we also observed the eh stratification and cyclic pattern and the evolution of the eh 60 70 cm in the unsaturated zone under different frequencies of water level fluctuation 3 2 n and doc dynamics 3 2 1 nitrogen mass balance we start our discussion by comparing overall system efficiency in terms of biogeochemical degradation although it is difficult to reach full mass balance in such a complex system bulk numbers do provide an interesting view of the mixing and cycling efficiency normalized values for n removal from the system are presented in table 1 values were either computed using overall system mass balance over operation cycles cases 3 1 3 3 or according to sampling times cases 1 and 2 and normalized for cycle length due to the sampling depth the n mass balance in cases 1 and 2 can only indicate the depth between 50 and 100 cm generally the net tn mass was calculated by subtracting tn output mass from tn input mass then the net tn mass was averaged throughout two adjacent samplings the input tn mass was calculated by multiplying influent concentration and volume in case 1 the output tn mass was calculated by multiplying effluent concentration and volume during sampling in cases 2 and 3 the excess drainage volume which adjusted the water level needs to be considered for output tn mass in case 1 n mass was lost in the soil column continuously and eventually almost reached equilibrium n accumulated in the soil column in case 2 as excess influent was infiltrated and n was washed from the upper part of the column to the bottom part in case 3 the lost n mass in one cycle decreased with the increasing frequency of groundwater fluctuation because high tn at 10 40 cm was consumed gradually with the soil column operation figs 7 8 9 additionally tn at 70 100 cm had already been in an equilibrium state 3 2 2 n and doc distributions we move to look at the dynamics of various n and related species in the column figs 5 and 6 present the spatio temporal distribution of nh 4 no 3 doc and tn for cases 1 and 2 respectively in the saturated zone in case 1 where o2 was more limited nitrification was likely minimal chen et al 2018 sopilniak et al 2017 whereas nitrate reduction denitrification was significant in the early stage of the experiment 15 days especially in the deeper layers we associate much of the dynamics in the early stages first 15 days or so to initial conditions and stabilization of the system for case 2 the pictures are very similar to case 1 but with much milder initial effects note that case 2 is a direct continuation of case 1 the o2 that entered the system through the pulsed infiltration events combined with better mixing in comparison to case 1 was sufficient for significant n degradation in the system the average of doc in each depth was lower than that in case 1 thus most of the initial carbon in the system was consumed the results indicated that the mild vertical flow in the system due to the pulsed infiltration events was sufficient to create much better mixing conditions for o2 and the superiority of oxidizing processes nitrification mineralization over reducing ones was observed even at the deeper layers fig 7 presents the system dynamics for the low frequency fluctuations 18 day cycle nitrate and tn patterns followed the water level with a sharp interface between high above the water level and low below the water level concentrations clear advection processes were dominant here with minimal mixing between the above and below compartments denitrification above 60 cm was minimal if at all nitrate concentrations below the water level were very low while nh 4 and organic n were present suggesting little o2 to facilitate nitrification ammonium below 60 cm was very stable and seemed not to be affected by the water movement in part this may be related to sorption related retention although sorption in sandy soil is relatively small cec 2 56 cmol kg here generally similar results are seen for case 3 2 fig 8 12 day cycle but with several interesting differences similar to case 3 1 the high and low no 3 patterns followed the water level with an apparent phase delay because the soil column lost tn continuously and slowly in case 3 1 table 1 no 3 at each depth in case 3 2 was slightly lower than that of case 3 1 ammonium followed the water level fluctuations but with a much smaller vertical amplitude of roughly 5 cm compared to 30 cm amplitude for the water level furthermore unlike case 3 1 nh 4 concentrations below the water level fell slowly over time from 11 to 6 mg n l clear chemical smearing of the sharp interface across the water level that is best seen for no 3 in all earlier cases is evident in case 3 2 which is due to the important role of the cf the cf can increase the contact between gaseous and aqueous phases in the zone around the water level which may drive some transport and reaction processes in both the cf and the shallow regions of the saturated zone including 1 geochemical alteration and 2 o2 availability and nutrient to microbes berkowitz et al 2004 the vertical motion of a fluid can form unequal distribution of chemicals o2 and bacteria at the cf which makes the cf a highly active zone of biodegradation hack et al 2015 case 3 3 fig 9 6 day cycle further amplifies the observations seen for case 3 2 fluctuations in all species are seen but they are more restrained for example while in case 3 2 the tn interface amplitude is 10 cm in case 3 3 it is smeared and only islands of elevated values are seen at about 50 cm depth similar patterns are seen for nh 4 with a slight drop in concentration for the high ammonium belt 70 90 cm seen just before the water level drops no 3 similar islands at about 50 cm associated with the timing of the water level increases and doc islands at 50 70 cm associated with the water level increases it is important to note however that in many of the plots the islands are associated with the shallowest point where samples could be obtained sampling points are the crosses from fig 5 to fig 9 and therefore it is more than likely that those islands extend further upwards that is the fluctuations are likely more intense than they appear in the plots this suggests much better mixing in the cf region which intensifies with the frequency of the fluctuations 3 2 3 eh and n based zonation the zonation of redox has been shown in fig 4 only depends on the eh based on the eh distribution fig 3 the redox zonation fig 4 no 3 and nh 4 concentrations the soil column can be divided into four functional zones in case 3 table 2 which depict the zonation in the soil column more accurately in our case no 3 produced at the near surface hardly moved downward no2 was in low concentration in the soil column because it is a labile and intermediate product thus no2 is not considered specifically when we analyze n transformation anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria oshiki et al 2016 were not detected in the soil column 16 s rrna sequencing results are not shown here so we ignore anammox processes here depending on the water level the distribution of no 3 was influenced but there was not a constant bottom boundary for the nitrification region however the constant upper boundaries of the denitrification region exist for each case they were 50 cm 60 cm 70 cm for cases 1 2 and 3 respectively this indicates the amount of o2 was enough for nitrification in the shallow depths and the transport distance of o2 was only influenced by soil properties and the water level location in miller et al 2006 s study they found o2 can penetrate to a depth of about 0 6 m within the first few days of dry periods because of the combination of biochemical oxygen demand and slow water transport i e advection o2 contents increased more slowly at greater depths miller et al 2006 in our soil column we infer that o2 can reach to the anoxic zone 70 cm 3 2 4 tn related biogeochemical processes the distribution of tn was related to the dominant n species when the water level decreased o2 could flow into the system in the aerobic and hypoxic zones no 3 was the dominant n species and nitrification of nh 4 to no 3 and no 3 accumulation caused high tn in the anoxic and anaerobic zones nh 4 was the dominant n species denitrification was effective in removing no 3 to nh 4 the average tn concentrations for certain depths and time are listed in table 3 in the last cycle of each case the nutrition state in the soil column was relatively stable which can represent the performance for each case during the last cycle the nutrition state from 40 to 90 cm at a high water level was the lowest so it is the optimal moment and range to extract post treatment water for downstream usage similar tn states between subcases in case 3 at the high water level means a short cycle case 3 3 can be applied in case 3 a large difference of tn between wl 25 cm and wl 85 cm occurred at 50 cm and 60 cm and a relative low tn was observed at 40 to 60 cm when wl 25 cm this indicates that coupling nitrification and denitrification here was effective to remove tn at this active region which can partly be supported by the fluctuating eh at 60 cm considering stable no 3 nh 4 and tn at 20 30 and 70 100 cm we can infer n transformations was under the capacity of nitrifier at shallow depths and denitrifier at deep depths two paths can contribute to the loss of tn 1 volatilization of unionized ammonia 2 n2o and n2 emission from denitrification volatilization of unionized ammonia needs high ph 9 4 zhang et al 2015 however the effluent ph was 7 09 0 23 in this soil column thus denitrification was the only path for tn removal in sat systems some nh 4 is nitrified during drying periods and subsequently denitrified during wetting periods miller et al 2006 sopilniak et al 2017 also found that all the nh 4 which accumulated in the shallow subsurface 0 0 8 m during the flooding period was converted to no 3 during the drying period denitrification requires a reducing or anoxic environment in the soil with abundant bacterial population and electron donors e g doc ollivier et al 2013 subramaniam et al 2016 in our system infiltration limited denitrification due to the supply of o2 at the shallow depths in case 2 compared to case 3 3 2 5 doc related biogeochemical processes doc states in the soil column are presented as the same form of tn table 3 similar to tn the average doc concentration from 40 90 cm at the high water level during the last cycle was the lowest from case 3 1 to case 3 3 the drastic decrease of doc at each depth supports the idea that a high frequency of groundwater fluctuation is efficient to remove doc doc can be removed either by respiration denitrification sorption precipitation or agglomeration of particulate om on the soil surface in the reducing condition cameron and schipper 2010 kaiser et al 2001 ollivier et al 2013 zheng et al 2009 in our system doc consumption is mainly contributed by respiration and denitrification where o2 content is the key factor the volume of influent was small and the do was relatively low 4 90 0 48 mg l making diffusive transport from the soil surface sufficient for nitrification miller et al 2006 elkayam et al 2015 found that during drying periods air that penetrated from the surface driven by gravitational water drainage increased the do in the system in our case superfluous doc was present for all depths to guarantee reducing condition which was the same as ollivier et al 2013 s work therefore doc availability was not the limiting factor for denitrification we move to doc distribution in cases 1 and 2 in case 1 doc concentration in the soil column was higher than the influent due to the original om in the soil in case 2 doc at 50 70 cm was consumed due to aerobic respiration at 80 90 cm doc was higher than the shallower depths because the conversion rate of doc for denitrification is less than that of aerobic respiration chen and strous 2013 thus we conclude that the introduction of om source and o2 through the pulsed infiltration and the water mixing associated with these pulses trigged more significant oxidation reduction processes at most depths at the shallow depths o2 availability was much higher than in the deeper ones where it was more limited this also suggests that in case 1 minimal o2 demand was the dominant factor rather than o2 availability good correlation between doc and soil matric potential spearman correlation case 2 r 0 63 case 3 2 r 0 62 case 3 3 r 0 74 p 0 01 for all cases indicates that doc is strongly dependent on water level after comparing doc between the three groundwater fluctuation cases case 3 the decreasing trend of doc with the increasing frequency of groundwater fluctuation case 3 1 towards case 3 3 can be observed this trend is most likely caused by both the increasing respiration due to increasing o2 supply at depth 70 cm and increasing denitrification at 70 cm as the anaerobic zone became more reducing the distribution of doc in case 2 had an increasing trend along with the depth while in case 1 and case 3 the opposite trend was observed this effect could be because within the infiltration case it was relatively easy to bring o2 into the column with water flow which supported doc decomposition above the anoxic zone i e 70 cm also the decomposition rate of om in the aerobic depths was much higher than that in the anaerobic depths zhang et al 2018 in case 3 o2 was relatively limited in the subsurface so denitrification was the main path to consume doc however case 2 had much more abundant o2 relative to that in case 3 at 20 70 cm due to water flow direction and low water content fig s2 abundant o2 supply contributed to low doc in these depths relative to the doc in case 3 additionally in case 3 1 there is a decreasing trend of doc at 90 cm until the 27th day 48 89 to 11 73 mg l fig 7 this can be seen as a transition time period between two different hydrologic cases case 2 and case 3 3 2 6 doc din ratio the ratio of the five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 to the total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn is a rule of thumb parameter to indicate the competition between nitrifiers and heterotrophs for the common substrates in the nitrifying systems of the wastewater treatment rittmann and mccarty 2001 the ratio shows variations according to the removal efficiency of nitrogen phosphate and other pollutants zhao et al 2010 for different studies different expressions were adopted for the same usage such as cod tn carrera et al 2004 bod5 tn waki et al 2007 cod no 3 chiu and chung 2003 and so on in summary they used two items to represent heterotrophs and nitrifiers respectively as doc has a similar biogeochemical meaning as bod5 and chemical oxygen demand cod it can be used to interpret heterotrophs cod tkn is common in nitrifying wastewater treatment gupta and sharma 1996 ryu et al 2008 however in the different depths of this soil column the dominant n species no 3 or nh 4 varied so tkn ignored the contribution from no 3 in order to show the whole picture of coupling nitrification denitrification processes herein we adopted the ratio of doc to the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din fig 10 as discussed above the column had excessive doc throughout the experiment as denitrification was dominant and no 3 was consumed in the lower portion of the soil column a stable low doc din ratio was observed in cases 1 and 2 doc din at 100 cm was a little higher in case 2 5 49 0 66 compared to case 1 1 42 1 32 this is due to two reasons 1 high no 3 in the original soil flowed in and accumulated here 2 at the end of case 1 no 3 at 100 cm was consumed up in cases 3 1 and 3 2 low and constant doc din was observed at 20 40 cm and 70 90 cm due to high no 3 in the upper portion of the soil column doc din was lower at 20 40 cm relative to 70 90 cm at 50 60 cm doc din exhibited high values relative to other depths except for the low water level stage wl 85 cm this is due to the low values of no 3 and nh 4 additionally doc din was stable and high at 100 cm due to doc accumulation hence the soil column exhibited 4 different zones 20 40 50 60 70 90 100 cm in case 3 3 it had the same zonation but the range of high doc din zone expanded from 50 60 cm to 40 60 cm we believe both aerobic microsites and anaerobic microsites existed closely here during the drying period to support nitrification and denitrification respectively azam et al 2002 subramaniam et al 2016 the process of diffusion can effectively transport no 3 which is the end product of nitrification from the aerobic microsite to the boundaries of the aerobic microsite and anaerobic microsite to maintain denitrification though long distance transportation is limited in an anaerobic microsite subramaniam et al 2016 thus efficient tn removal was achieved while the hypoxic zone was originally defined within this range 40 50 cm with the increasing frequency of groundwater fluctuation the residual water content can cause it to expand as observed in case 3 3 generally doc din in case 3 was higher than cases 1 and 2 which was mainly caused by the decreasing no 3 and nh 4 in the lower half of the soil column the above discussions proved doc din is effective in detecting the strength of nitrification denitrification and distinguish the zonation in a soil system few studies explored the role of the cf for the n cycle under water level fluctuation which was similar to the processes in our soil column among these studies bouskill et al 2019 studied the n cycle in the cf with an annual fluctuation of water level in a floodplain and concluded that abiotic dilution by rising groundwater and biotic processes nitrification and denitrification are responsible for n dynamics at the cf and are driven by the water level fluctuation they found facultative denitrifying aerobes with flexible metabolism can switch from respiration through o2 to no 3 as an electron acceptor at the cf under fluctuating aerobic conditions in a drained sandy soil abit et al 2008 revealed that due to the re supply o2 at the cf with partially saturated property it can limit the development of anoxic conditions for denitrification additionally some studies discussed the o2 availability in the cf under water level fluctuation which can be used to indirectly indicate the c and n cycle haberer et al 2014 haberer et al 2012 haberer et al 2014 pointed out that in the case of a fluctuating water level two pronounced mechanisms of o2 transfer within the cf can be identified mass transfer between entrapped gas and groundwater and vertical diffusive mass flux of o2 water level fluctuations enhanced the mass transfer of o2 from the atmosphere into the groundwater relative to steady state conditions haberer et al 2012 this o2 facilitated the oxidation of nh 4 at the lower part of the soil column when this o2 was consumed up nitrate which is the end product of nitrification was sufficient for denitrification in the middle of our column moreover no similar field observation can be found to compare with our lab results which deserves future attention 3 3 indications of major aqueous elements of porewater to the redox processes in case 3 all the redox sensitive chemicals no 3 nh 4 fe mn p s had a significant relationship with the eh table s3 si fig 11 compares major aqueous elements in all cases at different depths essentially aqueous elements concentrations at 100 cm in case 2 were much higher than those of case 3 except for p this indicates that the infiltration washed elements faster from the soil column and the concentrations of these aqueous elements in the column were higher than those of the influent in cases 2 and 3 fe and mn can hardly be detected in the aerobic and hypoxic zone 20 60 cm while they were abundant in the anoxic and anaerobic zone 70 90 cm fe and mn were not added into the influent this fe distribution indicates the reductive dissolution of ferric iron mineral phases aqueous elements i e p mn which have a close relationship with fe redox cycling exhibited the same depth trends rezanezhad et al 2014 a significant positive relationship was found for pairs of aqueous fe and p and aqueous fe and mn in each case table s4 si this is because they can all be released from the soil surface at the low eh conditions reddy and delaune 2008b schönbrunner et al 2012 from case 3 1 to case 3 3 aqueous fe at 60 90 cm decreased significantly case 3 1 1 35 mg l case 3 2 0 44 mg l case 3 3 0 18 mg l in case 3 3 most of the aqueous fe had been washed in the previous cases while aqueous mn at 60 90 cm decreased gradually case 3 1 2 49 mg l case 3 2 2 19 mg l case 3 3 1 85 mg l it infers fe and mn moved out of the soil column gradually in case 2 p concentration in the soil column was close to the influent 1 41 mg l and was stable in case 3 p concentration was much higher than the influent from 70 to 90 cm which indicates aqueous p accumulated in the anoxic and anaerobic zone case 3 1 7 12 mg l case 3 2 6 38 mg l case 3 3 8 05 mg l additionally p concentrations were similar in the trend and range within subcases of case 3 in case 2 aqueous s at 60 to 90 cm was stable and a little higher than that of the influent 35 28 mg l which was much higher than the aqueous s in case 3 case 3 1 8 39 mg l case 3 2 8 10 mg l case 3 3 6 55 mg l from case 3 1 to case 3 3 aqueous s concentration at 20 to 50 cm decreased and the decreasing slope from 20 to 50 cm for each case was similar aqueous s concentration was lower than that of the influent at 60 40 30 cm for cases 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 respectively since 60 cm aqueous s remained similar at lower depths between cases phosphorus adsorption in soils is affected by both physical and chemical factors among which alternative redox conditions in soils and the related fe oxides transformations are extremely important brand klibanski et al 2007 consequently alternative oxidation reduction conditions cause p to move through the soil scalenghe et al 2014 in the anoxic and anaerobic zone of our column p in the porewater was higher than that in the aerobic and hypoxic zone this is the opposite situation to ollivier et al 2013 s study where most of the p precipitated on near surface soil cha et al 2006 and ollivier et al 2013 found in the high cec soil phosphate from the influent can be physically adsorbed onto the minerals ferric hydroxides aluminum oxides silicate minerals of the clays carbonate minerals or chemically precipitate to react with ammonium magnesium or calcium but our research soil is sandy soil with low cec 2 56 cmol kg under a reducing condition sulfate so 4 2 could transform to sulfite so 3 2 and if possible further to sulfide s2 which is subsequently removed from solution as sulfide mineral phases cha et al 2006 rezanezhad et al 2014 this explains the drastic change of s from the aerobic zone to the anaerobic zone in this soil column in the anaerobic zone black particles accumulated fig s3 si considering aqueous fe was also consumed quickly we infer these particles were ferrous sulfide fes gong et al 2016 personna et al 2008 we predict after the consumption of fe manganese sulfide mns will be generated subsequently according to the sequence of redox pairs stumm and morgan 1996 near soil surface sulfide can be oxidized to sulfate this contributed to a high concentration of aqueous s at 20 to 30 cm due to the increasing frequency of groundwater fluctuation the range of low aqueous s extended from case 3 1 to case 3 3 in case 3 3 aqueous s at 20 to 50 cm was much lower than those of case 3 1 and case 3 2 this supports the idea that the column became more anaerobic fes is a prevalent non toxic mineral and a precursor to other stable iron sulfide minerals gong et al 2016 fes can not only adsorb pollutants but also involve redox processes to remove redox sensitive pollutants chen et al 2019 thus the naturally generated fes particles in the anaerobic zone of a redox dynamic system is crucial for biogeochemical processes which need further research to figure out its fate and transport here si originates from the sand it was distributed equally from 20 80 cm in case 3 which indicates homogeneous soil distribution to rule out the effect of redox processes based on the correlation analysis with soil matric potential ca is selected to be the conservative tracer to show the purely physical processes from its distribution spearman correlation case 2 r 0 60 case 3 1 r 0 71 case 3 2 r 0 64 case 3 3 r 0 81 p 0 05 for all cases the leach of the si and ca ions to the bottom tank caused the drop of their concentrations when the soil depth was lower than 80 cm in case 3 this indicates the bottom boundary influences the deep depths the highest ca concentration was found at 20 cm in case 3 which can partly explain the accumulation of no 3 in the shallow surface from physical processes the experience of long term operation of such a long column experiment suggests that a highly instrumented soil column is useful to mimic soil biogeochemical processes and the experimental design to be improved in four aspects 1 using a fully sealed soil column can help better control the aerobic status and can allow for better measuring greenhouse gases co2 ch4 and n2o emissions for accurate estimation of carbon and nitrogen mass balance 2 setting of ph and do electrodes can achieve better monitoring as the eh is influenced by ph it is useful to record ph in parallel to the eh making the analysis more accurate and the comparison to other studies easier zhang and furman 2021 do measurement can provide more direct evidence for the aerobic status along the soil column than the eh alone 3 comparing the same frequency of water level fluctuation induced by both groundwater fluctuation and infiltration can advance the understanding of the biogeochemical processes in the subsurface under simultaneous multiple dynamic hydrologic regimes 4 measuring microbial community composition and function in such column can provide further insight for the biogeochemical processes 4 conclusions we examined n transformations at a dynamic cf through a highly instrumented sandy soil column experiment under five hydrologic regimes including static water level periodic pulsed infiltration with a constant water level and groundwater fluctuation under three frequencies 6 12 18 day cycle four distinct redox zones can be recognized in the soil column for all groundwater fluctuation cases aerobic zone 10 30 cm hypoxic zone 40 50 cm anoxic zone 60 70 cm anaerobic zone 80 100 cm the eh was relatively stable for all the zones except for the anoxic zone the cyclic pattern of the eh with groundwater fluctuation occurred at the upper anoxic zone 60 cm and the eh declined slowly to reach those of the anaerobic zone at the lower anoxic zone 70 cm in the aerobic and hypoxic zones no 3 was the dominant nitrogen species while nh 4 was the dominant nitrogen species in the anoxic and anaerobic zones fig 12 summarizes the different biogeochemical processes that characterize the system for case 3 through controlling o2 supply water level fluctuation impacts the cycling pattern of the lower boundary of the nitrate dominant zone as denitrification achieved its full capacity in the anaerobic zone the upper boundary of the high ammonium zone was constant the increasing frequency of groundwater fluctuation can enhance nitrogen removal with alternating nitrification and denitrification the co occurrence of nitrification and denitrification at the boundary of the hypoxic and anoxic zones facilitated high total nitrogen removal the relative strength of nitrification denitrification and the zonation of n status in the soil system can be inferred by the ratio of

4168,the capillary fringe cf is the last barrier for groundwater protection studies investigating the effects of cyclic groundwater fluctuation on nitrogen transformations a critical biogenic element in soil systems received less attention relative to near surface and groundwater processes we conducted an experiment in a highly instrumented 91 cm sandy soil column under five hydrologic regimes 1 stagnant system with a static water level 2 periodic pulsed infiltration with a constant water level and 3 groundwater fluctuation under three frequencies 6 12 18 day cycle under groundwater fluctuation regimes the soil column can be divided into four zones aerobic zone 10 30 cm hypoxic zone 40 50 cm anoxic zone 60 70 cm and anaerobic zone 80 100 cm the stable high eh occurred in the aerobic and hypoxic zones while the stable low eh appeared in the anaerobic zone the eh at the upper anoxic zone 60 cm appeared to show a strong cyclic pattern and the eh at the lower anoxic zone 70 cm gradually decreased until it reached values similar to the anaerobic zone nitrate overwhelmed other nitrogen species in the aerobic and hypoxic zones the lower boundary of the nitrate dominant zone was sensitive to the water level which means that oxygen supply depends on the water level fluctuation ammonium dominated the anoxic and anaerobic zones and the upper boundary of the high ammonium zone was constant which implies that denitrification reached the maximum capacity in the anaerobic zone the dominance of a single species in these zones suggests incomplete cycling of nitrogen in contrast nitrogen removal was enhanced with increasing frequency of groundwater fluctuation low total nitrogen concentration was observed at the hypoxic and anoxic zones boundary due to the co occurrence of nitrification and denitrification the ratio of dissolved organic carbon to dissolved inorganic nitrogen can indicate the relative strength of nitrification denitrification subsequently distinguish the zonation of nitrogen status in this soil system additionally ferrous sulfide particles accumulated at the anaerobic zone with intensified reducing condition which deserves more attention the observations presented in this study strengthen the understanding that the cf acts as a hot spot and occasionally as a hot moment which is of great importance to chemical cycling

effect on soil o2 and eh pal et al 2010 studied nitrification and denitrification dynamics during three oxic anoxic cycles of microcosms in partially degraded peat they observed high nitrification activity while denitrification activity decreased with each anoxic phase due to limited degradable carbon sources therefore soil systems with fluctuating water levels can be considered a

ben moshe et al 2020 miller et al 2006 silver et al 2018 regarding wastewater infiltration miller et al 2006 explored the dependence of nitrogen fate and transport on o2 availability at an sat site operated in infiltration cycles 2 4 wet and 4 dry days and provided suggestions for the operation of sat sites silver et al 2018 used treated wastewater infiltration to study n cycling and the origin of nh 4 with cycles of drying 3 4 days and wetting 3 4 days in a short term and long term column experiment 140 and 615 days respectively their results suggested that a combination of dnra and denitrification occurred during the wetting phase of the cycle and nitrification occurred during the drying phase additionally the study suggested that introducing o2 into the subsurface is helpful to eliminate some nitrogen mass through nitrification during the drying phase and denitrification during the subsequent wetting phase ben moshe et al 2020 found that by adjusting the frequency and length of drying and rewetting n transformations can be somewhat controlled both spatially depth and temporally while studies that focus on cyclic top n input with variable frequencies are common those that investigated the effects of cyclic water level fluctuation in soil systems are less frequent in the field scale hefting et al 2004 monitored several riparian zones with a fluctuating water level and concluded that the water level was the dominant factor for the n dynamics and its end product ye et al 2012 studied n dynamics in the riparian systems the elevations of 145 m to 175 m in a reservoir region under two cycles of drying and wetting for two years and found soil inorganic n decreased in the lab scale sasikala et al 2009 conducted wetland mesocosms to investigate the effects of water level fluctuation on n dynamics and aeration conditions in soils their results showed n removal and aeration of the soil can be significantly improved by water level fluctuation additionally rezanezhad et al 2014 adopted cyclic water level fluctuation 20 days for the 45 cm deep unsaturated zone with the continuous and automated upward and downward flow 4 8 cm d to study soil biogeochemical processes but did not consider the effects on nitrogen furthermore with a similar experimental setup pronk et al 2020 found distinct organic carbon consumption in the fluctuation zone of the soil column which was driven by a more active rather than more diverse microbial community while a suitable amount of knowledge exists regarding the effect of different cyclic dynamic hydrologic regimes with top input on n dynamics in soil systems only a limited number of studies used cyclic groundwater fluctuation with different frequencies and durations to understand n transformations in soil systems furthermore the comparison of n dynamics under cyclic hydrologic regimes with different frequencies and durations between the top and bottom input in a single system is also lacking our main goal is to analyze redox sensitive processes i e n cycling at the capillary fringe cf in a deep soil column induced by hydrologic regimes with different frequencies specific objectives include 1 quantifying the range of the functional zones in the soil column and revealing their roles for n transformations under different hydrologic regimes and 2 assessing the impacts of redox distribution on predicting n transformations and associated redox processes under different hydrologic regimes we hypothesize that 1 under the cyclic oxic and anoxic conditions of the soil system nitrification occurs at the upper unsaturated zone and denitrification exists at the lower unsaturated zone and saturated zone 2 the midportion of the soil column which undergoes alternative drying and rewetting contributes to both aerobic and anaerobic redox processes 3 the range of the midportion of the soil column changes with the hydrologic regimes in a unique sandy soil column that is highly instrumented we have investigated n transformations under five different hydrologic regimes including static periodic pulsed recharge and three dynamic groundwater fluctuation regimes our focus here is understanding the involved n processes and their reflectance in the eh dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 column description the research is conducted in a rectangular perspex soil

et al 2012 and the tucson az sat site in the usa miller et al 2006 that use cyclic drying and wetting period of several days we designed the experiment presented here accordingly three cases of the experiment were conducted as follows fig 2 1 static water level water level was kept at 55 cm following water and gas sampling every 3 days water level recovery was made from the bottom 2 periodic pulsed recharge water level was kept at 55 cm after water and gas sampling every 3 or 4 days a pulse of water was introduced from the top at 4 5 ml min continuously to replace 15 water in the column in 5 h simultaneously a tube that was connected to the bottom of the column was used to drain the surplus water to a plastic bottle 3 1 3 3 groundwater fluctuation the water level was increased by 20 30 60 cm respectively every 3 or 4 days from 85 cm to 25 cm then the water level was decreased by 20 30 60 cm respectively every 3 or 4 days from 25 cm to 85 cm the sampling campaigns at the end of each water level manipulation extracted minimal volume of water that accounts for 7 of the porewater therefore it had only minor and short lived effect on the biogeochemical processes that can recover shortly after sampling this minor effect is evident also in redox and nitrogen data continuity 2 4 analytical procedures before analysis porewater was filtered through a 0 22 µm filter unit pvdf

examined secondly after presenting the no 3 nh 4 tn doc dynamics biogeochemical processes i e nitrification denitrification and aerobic respiration which are coordinated with the eh distribution are discussed finally other redox processes fe mn p s are depicted to fulfill the evolution of soil biogeochemical processes in the soil column 3 1 eh dynamics 3 1 1 eh distributions in case 1 fig 3a following a stabilization period of about 15 days the eh at almost all depths became stable at 400 mv or slightly above this indicates either a decent supply of o2 at almost all depths or relatively low o2 demand on the other hand in case 2 fig 3b that in terms of the experiment is a continuation of case 1 the eh layering was observed after a similar stabilization time the main difference between cases 1 and 2 is the influent direction quantity and influent composition table s2 the top influent has higher concentrations of no 3 and nh 4 compared to the bottom influent this mild mixing and addition of nutrients are significant in the dynamics of the system close examination of the three different groundwater fluctuation cases cases 3 1 through 3 3 figs 3c e suggests that the upper parts of the soil column which were never fully saturated were virtually unaffected by the soil column operation and presented stable eh of 400 mv at the same time the lower depths were also mostly unaffected with the eh values at the 400 mv range with the exception of a short term increase when water was injected into or extracted out of the system the do in the bottom tank was 1 33 0 39 mg l this suggests that limited o2 in the influent 4 90 0 48 mg l was quickly consumed before it reached the upper depths in the groundwater fluctuation cases the water level can influence the o2 content in the headspace fig s1 si because o2 content has a linear relationship with the water content at 20 cm case 2 r2 0 31 case 3 1 r2 0 29 case 3 2 r2 0 20 case 3 3 r2 0 42 p 0 01 for all cases both drainage and imbibition can cause o2 content to decrease dramatically and recover gradually which was obvious in case 3 3 this phenomenon is related to the birch effect which is characterized by a burst in decomposition and mineralization along with the short term release of inorganic nitrogen and co2 upon rewetting during imbibition birch 1958 jarvis et al 2007 moyano et al 2013 this phenomenon occurs due to the increasing water content which connects pores and better enables labile organic matter om to be consumed by microbes and utilized for growth and respiration moyano et al 2013 during drainage o2 penetrated deeper into the soil column which stimulated the mineralization of om to co2 by soil microbes rezanezhad et al 2014 the upward movement of co2 was facilitated as the unsaturated portion of the soil expanded rezanezhad et al 2014 3 1 2 comparison of oxygen availability comparing cases 1 and 2 to the three different groundwater fluctuation cases cases 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 indicates similarity to case 2 in that the eh remained high in the shallow depths 400 mv low at the deepest end of the system 400 mv and in between in the more dynamic range this indicates o2 availability was close at the surface with limited o2 transfers to greater depths though the soil column was semi sealed it appears that the gaseous o2 was still sufficient to maintain oxidizing conditions in the unsaturated zone fig s1 the volumetric o2 content in the open atmosphere is 20 94 average volumetric o2 contents at the headspace from case 1 to case 3 3 were 17 51 16 96 17 62 17 81 and 17 77 respectively when considering o2 transfer through diffusion in both the gaseous and liquid phases these percentages make sense from a qualitative perspective the lower eh values in cases 2 and 3 when compared to case 1 suggest that mixing and om availability are important to consider we note that the reducing zone in case 3 all subcases was wider than that in case 2 and the carbon sources in cases 2 and 3 top and bottom sources respectively were similar which further support the importance of o2 availability in a system the average co2 concentration in the unsaturated zone at the lowest water level in each case was 3 762 ppm case 1 8 120 ppm case 2 13 186 ppm case 3 1 9 541 ppm case 3 2 and 10 093 ppm case 3 3 this indicates that both pulsed infiltration and groundwater fluctuation increase c respiration significantly in case 3 the intensity of c respiration did not show much variation except for case 3 1 this indicates that the difference in gas generation mostly appeared between cases not including subcases the exceptional high co2 concentration in case 3 1 is because the low water level water level wl 85 cm was much lower than that in case 2 wl 55 cm within this transition period of case 2 and case 3 a burst of co2 was released at the deep depth of the soil column which was exposed to the air for the first time the difference in co2 concentration between case 2 and case 3 was due to two reasons 1 expanded depth of the unsaturated zone and 2 more efficient o2 supply for respiration in the groundwater fluctuation case silver et al 2018 used 1 m height loamy sand column to study nitrogen infiltration with drying wetting cycles 3 4 days 3 4 days the water level was at 50 cm during the drying period they found the constant low eh 250 mv from 45 75 cm in case 2 the anaerobic condition can only be observed at 95 cm 500 mv in case 3 the low eh 400 mv zone can reach 70 cm comparing silver et al 2018 s results and our cases 2 and 3 it is suggested here that groundwater fluctuation can form anaerobic conditions more efficiently than the infiltration case both silver et al 2018 s and our results support the importance of o2 availability for the redox processes distribution in the subsurface 3 1 3 redox zonation the redox status of soils can be classified into four zones as follows mansfeldt 2003 oxidizing weakly reducing moderately reducing and strongly reducing conditions 400 200 to 400 100 to 200 and 100 mv respectively the main redox pairs in each zone can be found in the redox ladder zhang and furman 2021 based on this qualitative standard we divide the redox zones for each case fig 4 the classification of redox zonation is made by comparing all eh values at each depth of each case with the above criteria case 1 fig 3a was the beginning of the experiment so the redox zones did not obey the depth characteristic strictly in case 2 fig 3b the apparent transformation from oxidation to strong reduction was observed along the depth in case 3 figs 3c e a clear oxidizing zone was formed at 10 50 cm while the 70 100 cm depth was always in the strongly reducing range the regions around 60 cm in cases 3 2 and 3 3 were characterized by the changing eh regime according to the water level dynamics 3 1 4 conditions at the lower parts of the system in case 3 in all three groundwater fluctuation cases case 3 the lower end of the transition zone 60 70 cm showed more dynamic eh variation compared to the upper part 10 50 cm and the lower part 80 100 cm of the soil column this is to be expected as those depths shifted between unsaturated and saturated conditions the 60 cm data depicted much higher variation alternating between oxidizing conditions 400 mv and strongly reducing conditions 400 mv the 60 cm depth was at the boundary of unsaturated and saturated zones thus it is vulnerable to show the o2 availability from sections 3 2 and 3 3 below redox sensitive species no 3 nh 4 fe mn p s were in low concentration at this depth which means the dominant redox sensitive species can switch easily with the o2 availability the 70 cm data was generally tending to more reducing conditions and showed large variation for the beginning and ending in each case 436 330 mv the eh at 70 cm showed a gradually decreasing trend and eventually reached the same value as 80 cm in case 3 3 however the duration of the decreasing eh in case 3 1 and 3 2 can be estimated based on the trend based on the eh slope it is estimated to take 70 45 and 29 days for the eh at 70 cm to reach the stable values for cases 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 respectively this indicates that more frequent drying rewetting cycles form anaerobic conditions faster at 70 cm when the experiment was stopped at the end of each case and water was drained the low eh at 70 cm would immediately jump to the high eh values the 70 cm depth then needs another period of running to gradually reach anaerobic conditions this was to be expected as 70 cm was almost always very close to saturation fig s2 si both the high variability in the eh at 60 cm with water content at 50 cm fig s2 and the return of the eh at 70 cm suggests that gaseous o2 even with relatively low concentration was dominant over other o2 transfer mechanisms in the liquid phase diffusion and advection close examination of case 3 3 fig 3e suggests the eh at 60 cm at the beginning of ejection at low water level and the end of ejection at high water level rose from around 0 mv to 400 mv and 400 to 100 mv respectively this again supports the previous statement about the vulnerability of this depth to o2 availability interestingly the beginning of water injection to the system triggered a sharp eh increase to the 400 mv range followed by a slower decrease of the eh to the 400 mv range during drainage after a sharp increase to about 100 mv the eh remained stable it is important to note that these significant changes in the eh were associated with only about 8 8 change in water content from saturation of about 45 4 to 36 6 water content suggesting again that transport in the gaseous phase was dominant over the liquid phase transport even in very low aerated porosity furthermore there is a trend to extend the reducing conditions from 70 cm to 60 cm from cycle 1 to cycle 5 the stable eh at 60 cm at low water level decreased gradually 16 07 43 36 61 37 94 99 187 13 mv for cycles 4 and 5 fluctuation started to occur for the eh at the low water level simultaneously the eh at 70 cm had already reached the same value as 80 cm these two phenomenons hint that 60 cm started to approach to the reducing condition following the tracks of the eh at 70 cm in a 1 m column infiltration experiment silver et al 2018 found reducing condition was present at all the depths during the wetting period and the unsaturated zone 45 cm displayed large eh fluctuation during the drying period in another 2 m column infiltration experiment zhang et al 2018 a clear aerobic zone with constant high eh 25 cm a hypoxic zone with fluctuating high eh 40 cm an anoxic zone with fluctuating low eh 65 cm and an anaerobic zone with constant low eh 95 145 cm can be distinguished due to the eh values in our experiment we also observed the eh stratification and cyclic pattern and the evolution of the eh 60 70 cm in the unsaturated zone under different frequencies of water level fluctuation 3 2 n and doc dynamics 3 2 1 nitrogen mass balance we start our discussion by comparing overall system efficiency in terms of biogeochemical degradation although it is difficult to reach full mass balance in such a complex system bulk numbers do provide an interesting view of the mixing and cycling efficiency normalized values for n removal from the system are presented in table 1 values were either computed using overall system mass balance over operation cycles cases 3 1 3 3 or according to sampling times cases 1 and 2 and normalized for cycle length due to the sampling depth the n mass balance in cases 1 and 2 can only indicate the depth between 50 and 100 cm generally the net tn mass was calculated by subtracting tn output mass from tn input mass then the net tn mass was averaged throughout two adjacent samplings the input tn mass was calculated by multiplying influent concentration and volume in case 1 the output tn mass was calculated by multiplying effluent concentration and volume during sampling in cases 2 and 3 the excess drainage volume which adjusted the water level needs to be considered for output tn mass in case 1 n mass was lost in the soil column continuously and eventually almost reached equilibrium n accumulated in the soil column in case 2 as excess influent was infiltrated and n was washed from the upper part of the column to the bottom part in case 3 the lost n mass in one cycle decreased with the increasing frequency of groundwater fluctuation because high tn at 10 40 cm was consumed gradually with the soil column operation figs 7 8 9 additionally tn at 70 100 cm had already been in an equilibrium state 3 2 2 n and doc distributions we move to look at the dynamics of various n and related species in the column figs 5 and 6 present the spatio temporal distribution of nh 4 no 3 doc and tn for cases 1 and 2 respectively in the saturated zone in case 1 where o2 was more limited nitrification was likely minimal chen et al 2018 sopilniak et al 2017 whereas nitrate reduction denitrification was significant in the early stage of the experiment 15 days especially in the deeper layers we associate much of the dynamics in the early stages first 15 days or so to initial conditions and stabilization of the system for case 2 the pictures are very similar to case 1 but with much milder initial effects note that case 2 is a direct continuation of case 1 the o2 that entered the system through the pulsed infiltration events combined with better mixing in comparison to case 1 was sufficient for significant n degradation in the system the average of doc in each depth was lower than that in case 1 thus most of the initial carbon in the system was consumed the results indicated that the mild vertical flow in the system due to the pulsed infiltration events was sufficient to create much better mixing conditions for o2 and the superiority of oxidizing processes nitrification mineralization over reducing ones was observed even at the deeper layers fig 7 presents the system dynamics for the low frequency fluctuations 18 day cycle nitrate and tn patterns followed the water level with a sharp interface between high above the water level and low below the water level concentrations clear advection processes were dominant here with minimal mixing between the above and below compartments denitrification above 60 cm was minimal if at all nitrate concentrations below the water level were very low while nh 4 and organic n were present suggesting little o2 to facilitate nitrification ammonium below 60 cm was very stable and seemed not to be affected by the water movement in part this may be related to sorption related retention although sorption in sandy soil is relatively small cec 2 56 cmol kg here generally similar results are seen for case 3 2 fig 8 12 day cycle but with several interesting differences similar to case 3 1 the high and low no 3 patterns followed the water level with an apparent phase delay because the soil column lost tn continuously and slowly in case 3 1 table 1 no 3 at each depth in case 3 2 was slightly lower than that of case 3 1 ammonium followed the water level fluctuations but with a much smaller vertical amplitude of roughly 5 cm compared to 30 cm amplitude for the water level furthermore unlike case 3 1 nh 4 concentrations below the water level fell slowly over time from 11 to 6 mg n l clear chemical smearing of the sharp interface across the water level that is best seen for no 3 in all earlier cases is evident in case 3 2 which is due to the important role of the cf the cf can increase the contact between gaseous and aqueous phases in the zone around the water level which may drive some transport and reaction processes in both the cf and the shallow regions of the saturated zone including 1 geochemical alteration and 2 o2 availability and nutrient to microbes berkowitz et al 2004 the vertical motion of a fluid can form unequal distribution of chemicals o2 and bacteria at the cf which makes the cf a highly active zone of biodegradation hack et al 2015 case 3 3 fig 9 6 day cycle further amplifies the observations seen for case 3 2 fluctuations in all species are seen but they are more restrained for example while in case 3 2 the tn interface amplitude is 10 cm in case 3 3 it is smeared and only islands of elevated values are seen at about 50 cm depth similar patterns are seen for nh 4 with a slight drop in concentration for the high ammonium belt 70 90 cm seen just before the water level drops no 3 similar islands at about 50 cm associated with the timing of the water level increases and doc islands at 50 70 cm associated with the water level increases it is important to note however that in many of the plots the islands are associated with the shallowest point where samples could be obtained sampling points are the crosses from fig 5 to fig 9 and therefore it is more than likely that those islands extend further upwards that is the fluctuations are likely more intense than they appear in the plots this suggests much better mixing in the cf region which intensifies with the frequency of the fluctuations 3 2 3 eh and n based zonation the zonation of redox has been shown in fig 4 only depends on the eh based on the eh distribution fig 3 the redox zonation fig 4 no 3 and nh 4 concentrations the soil column can be divided into four functional zones in case 3 table 2 which depict the zonation in the soil column more accurately in our case no 3 produced at the near surface hardly moved downward no2 was in low concentration in the soil column because it is a labile and intermediate product thus no2 is not considered specifically when we analyze n transformation anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria oshiki et al 2016 were not detected in the soil column 16 s rrna sequencing results are not shown here so we ignore anammox processes here depending on the water level the distribution of no 3 was influenced but there was not a constant bottom boundary for the nitrification region however the constant upper boundaries of the denitrification region exist for each case they were 50 cm 60 cm 70 cm for cases 1 2 and 3 respectively this indicates the amount of o2 was enough for nitrification in the shallow depths and the transport distance of o2 was only influenced by soil properties and the water level location in miller et al 2006 s study they found o2 can penetrate to a depth of about 0 6 m within the first few days of dry periods because of the combination of biochemical oxygen demand and slow water transport i e advection o2 contents increased more slowly at greater depths miller et al 2006 in our soil column we infer that o2 can reach to the anoxic zone 70 cm 3 2 4 tn related biogeochemical processes the distribution of tn was related to the dominant n species when the water level decreased o2 could flow into the system in the aerobic and hypoxic zones no 3 was the dominant n species and nitrification of nh 4 to no 3 and no 3 accumulation caused high tn in the anoxic and anaerobic zones nh 4 was the dominant n species denitrification was effective in removing no 3 to nh 4 the average tn concentrations for certain depths and time are listed in table 3 in the last cycle of each case the nutrition state in the soil column was relatively stable which can represent the performance for each case during the last cycle the nutrition state from 40 to 90 cm at a high water level was the lowest so it is the optimal moment and range to extract post treatment water for downstream usage similar tn states between subcases in case 3 at the high water level means a short cycle case 3 3 can be applied in case 3 a large difference of tn between wl 25 cm and wl 85 cm occurred at 50 cm and 60 cm and a relative low tn was observed at 40 to 60 cm when wl 25 cm this indicates that coupling nitrification and denitrification here was effective to remove tn at this active region which can partly be supported by the fluctuating eh at 60 cm considering stable no 3 nh 4 and tn at 20 30 and 70 100 cm we can infer n transformations was under the capacity of nitrifier at shallow depths and denitrifier at deep depths two paths can contribute to the loss of tn 1 volatilization of unionized ammonia 2 n2o and n2 emission from denitrification volatilization of unionized ammonia needs high ph 9 4 zhang et al 2015 however the effluent ph was 7 09 0 23 in this soil column thus denitrification was the only path for tn removal in sat systems some nh 4 is nitrified during drying periods and subsequently denitrified during wetting periods miller et al 2006 sopilniak et al 2017 also found that all the nh 4 which accumulated in the shallow subsurface 0 0 8 m during the flooding period was converted to no 3 during the drying period denitrification requires a reducing or anoxic environment in the soil with abundant bacterial population and electron donors e g doc ollivier et al 2013 subramaniam et al 2016 in our system infiltration limited denitrification due to the supply of o2 at the shallow depths in case 2 compared to case 3 3 2 5 doc related biogeochemical processes doc states in the soil column are presented as the same form of tn table 3 similar to tn the average doc concentration from 40 90 cm at the high water level during the last cycle was the lowest from case 3 1 to case 3 3 the drastic decrease of doc at each depth supports the idea that a high frequency of groundwater fluctuation is efficient to remove doc doc can be removed either by respiration denitrification sorption precipitation or agglomeration of particulate om on the soil surface in the reducing condition cameron and schipper 2010 kaiser et al 2001 ollivier et al 2013 zheng et al 2009 in our system doc consumption is mainly contributed by respiration and denitrification where o2 content is the key factor the volume of influent was small and the do was relatively low 4 90 0 48 mg l making diffusive transport from the soil surface sufficient for nitrification miller et al 2006 elkayam et al 2015 found that during drying periods air that penetrated from the surface driven by gravitational water drainage increased the do in the system in our case superfluous doc was present for all depths to guarantee reducing condition which was the same as ollivier et al 2013 s work therefore doc availability was not the limiting factor for denitrification we move to doc distribution in cases 1 and 2 in case 1 doc concentration in the soil column was higher than the influent due to the original om in the soil in case 2 doc at 50 70 cm was consumed due to aerobic respiration at 80 90 cm doc was higher than the shallower depths because the conversion rate of doc for denitrification is less than that of aerobic respiration chen and strous 2013 thus we conclude that the introduction of om source and o2 through the pulsed infiltration and the water mixing associated with these pulses trigged more significant oxidation reduction processes at most depths at the shallow depths o2 availability was much higher than in the deeper ones where it was more limited this also suggests that in case 1 minimal o2 demand was the dominant factor rather than o2 availability good correlation between doc and soil matric potential spearman correlation case 2 r 0 63 case 3 2 r 0 62 case 3 3 r 0 74 p 0 01 for all cases indicates that doc is strongly dependent on water level after comparing doc between the three groundwater fluctuation cases case 3 the decreasing trend of doc with the increasing frequency of groundwater fluctuation case 3 1 towards case 3 3 can be observed this trend is most likely caused by both the increasing respiration due to increasing o2 supply at depth 70 cm and increasing denitrification at 70 cm as the anaerobic zone became more reducing the distribution of doc in case 2 had an increasing trend along with the depth while in case 1 and case 3 the opposite trend was observed this effect could be because within the infiltration case it was relatively easy to bring o2 into the column with water flow which supported doc decomposition above the anoxic zone i e 70 cm also the decomposition rate of om in the aerobic depths was much higher than that in the anaerobic depths zhang et al 2018 in case 3 o2 was relatively limited in the subsurface so denitrification was the main path to consume doc however case 2 had much more abundant o2 relative to that in case 3 at 20 70 cm due to water flow direction and low water content fig s2 abundant o2 supply contributed to low doc in these depths relative to the doc in case 3 additionally in case 3 1 there is a decreasing trend of doc at 90 cm until the 27th day 48 89 to 11 73 mg l fig 7 this can be seen as a transition time period between two different hydrologic cases case 2 and case 3 3 2 6 doc din ratio the ratio of the five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 to the total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn is a rule of thumb parameter to indicate the competition between nitrifiers and heterotrophs for the common substrates in the nitrifying systems of the wastewater treatment rittmann and mccarty 2001 the ratio shows variations according to the removal efficiency of nitrogen phosphate and other pollutants zhao et al 2010 for different studies different expressions were adopted for the same usage such as cod tn carrera et al 2004 bod5 tn waki et al 2007 cod no 3 chiu and chung 2003 and so on in summary they used two items to represent heterotrophs and nitrifiers respectively as doc has a similar biogeochemical meaning as bod5 and chemical oxygen demand cod it can be used to interpret heterotrophs cod tkn is common in nitrifying wastewater treatment gupta and sharma 1996 ryu et al 2008 however in the different depths of this soil column the dominant n species no 3 or nh 4 varied so tkn ignored the contribution from no 3 in order to show the whole picture of coupling nitrification denitrification processes herein we adopted the ratio of doc to the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din fig 10 as discussed above the column had excessive doc throughout the experiment as denitrification was dominant and no 3 was consumed in the lower portion of the soil column a stable low doc din ratio was observed in cases 1 and 2 doc din at 100 cm was a little higher in case 2 5 49 0 66 compared to case 1 1 42 1 32 this is due to two reasons 1 high no 3 in the original soil flowed in and accumulated here 2 at the end of case 1 no 3 at 100 cm was consumed up in cases 3 1 and 3 2 low and constant doc din was observed at 20 40 cm and 70 90 cm due to high no 3 in the upper portion of the soil column doc din was lower at 20 40 cm relative to 70 90 cm at 50 60 cm doc din exhibited high values relative to other depths except for the low water level stage wl 85 cm this is due to the low values of no 3 and nh 4 additionally doc din was stable and high at 100 cm due to doc accumulation hence the soil column exhibited 4 different zones 20 40 50 60 70 90 100 cm in case 3 3 it had the same zonation but the range of high doc din zone expanded from 50 60 cm to 40 60 cm we believe both aerobic microsites and anaerobic microsites existed closely here during the drying period to support nitrification and denitrification respectively azam et al 2002 subramaniam et al 2016 the process of diffusion can effectively transport no 3 which is the end product of nitrification from the aerobic microsite to the boundaries of the aerobic microsite and anaerobic microsite to maintain denitrification though long distance transportation is limited in an anaerobic microsite subramaniam et al 2016 thus efficient tn removal was achieved while the hypoxic zone was originally defined within this range 40 50 cm with the increasing frequency of groundwater fluctuation the residual water content can cause it to expand as observed in case 3 3 generally doc din in case 3 was higher than cases 1 and 2 which was mainly caused by the decreasing no 3 and nh 4 in the lower half of the soil column the above discussions proved doc din is effective in detecting the strength of nitrification denitrification and distinguish the zonation in a soil system few studies explored the role of the cf for the n cycle under water level fluctuation which was similar to the processes in our soil column among these studies bouskill et al 2019 studied the n cycle in the cf with an annual fluctuation of water level in a floodplain and concluded that abiotic dilution by rising groundwater and biotic processes nitrification and denitrification are responsible for n dynamics at the cf and are driven by the water level fluctuation they found facultative denitrifying aerobes with flexible metabolism can switch from respiration through o2 to no 3 as an electron acceptor at the cf under fluctuating aerobic conditions in a drained sandy soil abit et al 2008 revealed that due to the re supply o2 at the cf with partially saturated property it can limit the development of anoxic conditions for denitrification additionally some studies discussed the o2 availability in the cf under water level fluctuation which can be used to indirectly indicate the c and n cycle haberer et al 2014 haberer et al 2012 haberer et al 2014 pointed out that in the case of a fluctuating water level two pronounced mechanisms of o2 transfer within the cf can be identified mass transfer between entrapped gas and groundwater and vertical diffusive mass flux of o2 water level fluctuations enhanced the mass transfer of o2 from the atmosphere into the groundwater relative to steady state conditions haberer et al 2012 this o2 facilitated the oxidation of nh 4 at the lower part of the soil column when this o2 was consumed up nitrate which is the end product of nitrification was sufficient for denitrification in the middle of our column moreover no similar field observation can be found to compare with our lab results which deserves future attention 3 3 indications of major aqueous elements of porewater to the redox processes in case 3 all the redox sensitive chemicals no 3 nh 4 fe mn p s had a significant relationship with the eh table s3 si fig 11 compares major aqueous elements in all cases at different depths essentially aqueous elements concentrations at 100 cm in case 2 were much higher than those of case 3 except for p this indicates that the infiltration washed elements faster from the soil column and the concentrations of these aqueous elements in the column were higher than those of the influent in cases 2 and 3 fe and mn can hardly be detected in the aerobic and hypoxic zone 20 60 cm while they were abundant in the anoxic and anaerobic zone 70 90 cm fe and mn were not added into the influent this fe distribution indicates the reductive dissolution of ferric iron mineral phases aqueous elements i e p mn which have a close relationship with fe redox cycling exhibited the same depth trends rezanezhad et al 2014 a significant positive relationship was found for pairs of aqueous fe and p and aqueous fe and mn in each case table s4 si this is because they can all be released from the soil surface at the low eh conditions reddy and delaune 2008b schönbrunner et al 2012 from case 3 1 to case 3 3 aqueous fe at 60 90 cm decreased significantly case 3 1 1 35 mg l case 3 2 0 44 mg l case 3 3 0 18 mg l in case 3 3 most of the aqueous fe had been washed in the previous cases while aqueous mn at 60 90 cm decreased gradually case 3 1 2 49 mg l case 3 2 2 19 mg l case 3 3 1 85 mg l it infers fe and mn moved out of the soil column gradually in case 2 p concentration in the soil column was close to the influent 1 41 mg l and was stable in case 3 p concentration was much higher than the influent from 70 to 90 cm which indicates aqueous p accumulated in the anoxic and anaerobic zone case 3 1 7 12 mg l case 3 2 6 38 mg l case 3 3 8 05 mg l additionally p concentrations were similar in the trend and range within subcases of case 3 in case 2 aqueous s at 60 to 90 cm was stable and a little higher than that of the influent 35 28 mg l which was much higher than the aqueous s in case 3 case 3 1 8 39 mg l case 3 2 8 10 mg l case 3 3 6 55 mg l from case 3 1 to case 3 3 aqueous s concentration at 20 to 50 cm decreased and the decreasing slope from 20 to 50 cm for each case was similar aqueous s concentration was lower than that of the influent at 60 40 30 cm for cases 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 respectively since 60 cm aqueous s remained similar at lower depths between cases phosphorus adsorption in soils is affected by both physical and chemical factors among which alternative redox conditions in soils and the related fe oxides transformations are extremely important brand klibanski et al 2007 consequently alternative oxidation reduction conditions cause p to move through the soil scalenghe et al 2014 in the anoxic and anaerobic zone of our column p in the porewater was higher than that in the aerobic and hypoxic zone this is the opposite situation to ollivier et al 2013 s study where most of the p precipitated on near surface soil cha et al 2006 and ollivier et al 2013 found in the high cec soil phosphate from the influent can be physically adsorbed onto the minerals ferric hydroxides aluminum oxides silicate minerals of the clays carbonate minerals or chemically precipitate to react with ammonium magnesium or calcium but our research soil is sandy soil with low cec 2 56 cmol kg under a reducing condition sulfate so 4 2 could transform to sulfite so 3 2 and if possible further to sulfide s2 which is subsequently removed from solution as sulfide mineral phases cha et al 2006 rezanezhad et al 2014 this explains the drastic change of s from the aerobic zone to the anaerobic zone in this soil column in the anaerobic zone black particles accumulated fig s3 si considering aqueous fe was also consumed quickly we infer these particles were ferrous sulfide fes gong et al 2016 personna et al 2008 we predict after the consumption of fe manganese sulfide mns will be generated subsequently according to the sequence of redox pairs stumm and morgan 1996 near soil surface sulfide can be oxidized to sulfate this contributed to a high concentration of aqueous s at 20 to 30 cm due to the increasing frequency of groundwater fluctuation the range of low aqueous s extended from case 3 1 to case 3 3 in case 3 3 aqueous s at 20 to 50 cm was much lower than those of case 3 1 and case 3 2 this supports the idea that the column became more anaerobic fes is a prevalent non toxic mineral and a precursor to other stable iron sulfide minerals gong et al 2016 fes can not only adsorb pollutants but also involve redox processes to remove redox sensitive pollutants chen et al 2019 thus the naturally generated fes particles in the anaerobic zone of a redox dynamic system is crucial for biogeochemical processes which need further research to figure out its fate and transport here si originates from the sand it was distributed equally from 20 80 cm in case 3 which indicates homogeneous soil distribution to rule out the effect of redox processes based on the correlation analysis with soil matric potential ca is selected to be the conservative tracer to show the purely physical processes from its distribution spearman correlation case 2 r 0 60 case 3 1 r 0 71 case 3 2 r 0 64 case 3 3 r 0 81 p 0 05 for all cases the leach of the si and ca ions to the bottom tank caused the drop of their concentrations when the soil depth was lower than 80 cm in case 3 this indicates the bottom boundary influences the deep depths the highest ca concentration was found at 20 cm in case 3 which can partly explain the accumulation of no 3 in the shallow surface from physical processes the experience of long term operation of such a long column experiment suggests that a highly instrumented soil column is useful to mimic soil biogeochemical processes and the experimental design to be improved in four aspects 1 using a fully sealed soil column can help better control the aerobic status and can allow for better measuring greenhouse gases co2 ch4 and n2o emissions for accurate estimation of carbon and nitrogen mass balance 2 setting of ph and do electrodes can achieve better monitoring as the eh is influenced by ph it is useful to record ph in parallel to the eh making the analysis more accurate and the comparison to other studies easier zhang and furman 2021 do measurement can provide more direct evidence for the aerobic status along the soil column than the eh alone 3 comparing the same frequency of water level fluctuation induced by both groundwater fluctuation and infiltration can advance the understanding of the biogeochemical processes in the subsurface under simultaneous multiple dynamic hydrologic regimes 4 measuring microbial community composition and function in such column can provide further insight for the biogeochemical processes 4 conclusions we examined n transformations at a dynamic cf through a highly instrumented sandy soil column experiment under five hydrologic regimes including static water level periodic pulsed infiltration with a constant water level and groundwater fluctuation under three frequencies 6 12 18 day cycle four distinct redox zones can be recognized in the soil column for all groundwater fluctuation cases aerobic zone 10 30 cm hypoxic zone 40 50 cm anoxic zone 60 70 cm anaerobic zone 80 100 cm the eh was relatively stable for all the zones except for the anoxic zone the cyclic pattern of the eh with groundwater fluctuation occurred at the upper anoxic zone 60 cm and the eh declined slowly to reach those of the anaerobic zone at the lower anoxic zone 70 cm in the aerobic and hypoxic zones no 3 was the dominant nitrogen species while nh 4 was the dominant nitrogen species in the anoxic and anaerobic zones fig 12 summarizes the different biogeochemical processes that characterize the system for case 3 through controlling o2 supply water level fluctuation impacts the cycling pattern of the lower boundary of the nitrate dominant zone as denitrification achieved its full capacity in the anaerobic zone the upper boundary of the high ammonium zone was constant the increasing frequency of groundwater fluctuation can enhance nitrogen removal with alternating nitrification and denitrification the co occurrence of nitrification and denitrification at the boundary of the hypoxic and anoxic zones facilitated high total nitrogen removal the relative strength of nitrification denitrification and the zonation of n status in the soil system can be inferred by the ratio of doc din we infer that the reducing conditions at the anaerobic zone were intensified and that fes sediments were generated which deserves more focus credit authorship contribution statement zengyu

4169,meteorological droughts propagate through the hydrological cycle causing hydrological droughts and societal impacts however the effects of climate and basin characteristics on hydrologic drought propagation vary regionally and remain largely unclear in this paper we characterize meteorological and hydrological droughts in 457 basins in brazil using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardized streamflow index ssi we investigate hydrologic drought propagation based on differences in drought onset the center of mass and time to peak additionally we estimate the recovery time of meteorological and hydrologic drought events the results indicate that hydrological droughts are usually more long lasting severe and with a slower recovery time compared to meteorological droughts while the most severe meteorological droughts are observed in humid regions e g amazon and southern brazil the most severe and long lasting hydrological droughts are found in the driest region i e northeast brazil or mostly impacted by human activities i e southeast brazil hydrological droughts in dry regions can take four times longer to recover than meteorological ones for most regions the propagation time was slightly different considering the different approaches our results highlight the importance of a multi indicator approach to fully characterize the mechanisms controlling the development and propagation of droughts through the water cycle keywords drought propagation meteorological drought hydrological drought standardized drought indices brazil 1 introduction droughts are associated with major economic losses and damages to the ecosystem wilhite 2000 between 1970 and 2012 droughts were responsible for approximately one third of deaths related to natural disasters and an economic loss of 200 billion dollars worldwide wmo 2014 they threaten food production energy generation water supply and can intensify wildfires and tree mortality doughty et al 2015 melo et al 2016 taufik et al 2017 brás et al 2019 thus improving drought characterization is crucial to enhance its monitoring management and prediction drought is defined as the period in which water availability is below what would be normally expected and fails to meet human or environmental needs wilhite and pulwarty 2018 these events are broadly classified into four categories wilhite and glantz 1985 i meteorological drought associated with negative anomalies in precipitation ii agricultural drought related to a decline in soil moisture iii hydrological drought when there is a deficit in the streamflow iv socio economic drought when events have socio economic impacts several drought indices have been developed to identify characterize and compare these events for example the world meteorological organization wmo recommends the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 for monitoring meteorological droughts hayes et al 2011 for hydrological droughts the standardized streamflow index ssi shukla and wood 2008 vicente serrano et al 2012 is commonly used yet since droughts are related to more than a single variable using only one variable index may lead to an incomplete analysis therefore several multivariate indices have been created vicente serrano et al 2010 hao and aghakouchak 2014 typically negative anomalies in precipitation propagate slowly through the hydrological cycle giving rise to hydrological drought this process is denoted as drought propagation eltahir and yeh 1999 and depends on the climate biophysical and geographic properties of the region as well as anthropogenic influences wu et al 2021 it is well known that under limited or no anthropogenic influences drought propagation is primarily controlled by the climate and biophysical characteristics of the hydrographic basin van loon 2015 van lanen et al 2013 in addition human activities such as land cover change dams irrigation and urbanization can significantly alter hydrological processes e g evaporation infiltration and consequently drought propagation van loon et al 2016 numerous studies have attempted to model and understand drought propagation and its drivers apurv and cai 2020 wu et al 2021 barker et al 2016 found that in the united kingdom propagation time from meteorological to hydrological droughts was mostly one or two months with basins with large aquifers showing a longer propagation time a similar propagation time was found by zeng et al 2015 in the jialing river basin xu et al 2019 showed that for a basin in china human changes such as the increase in domestic water supply and the expansion of urbanization decreased drought propagation time while agriculture activities increased it land cover can also have a strong influence on the propagation time wu et al 2018 forest areas presented a longer propagation time while pasture areas had a slower propagation for basins in china moreover climate and land use changes are the major aspects that modify drought propagation zhou et al 2019 wu et al 2020 outlined a framework for hydrological drought recovery analysis based on a drought propagation perspective however the absence of a standard methodology to calculate the time of propagation and the limited understanding of how meteorological droughts develop into hydrological droughts hinders the analysis monitoring and development of early warning systems barker et al 2016 brazil is particularly vulnerable to droughts given that hydroelectricity corresponds to 70 of its energy generation and irrigated agriculture is 32 of the country s water use getirana 2016 melo et al 2016 recently most brazilian regions faced the most severe and intense droughts of the last 60 years cunha et al 2019 the northeast region has suffered severe impacts due to the 2013 drought the worst in 100 years which affected agriculture and livestock gutiérrez et al 2014 in southeastern brazil the 2014 drought compromised the water supply of 28 million people melo et al 2016 water consumption and climatic changes are predicted to intensify droughts even more marengo et al 2017 morales et al 2020 threatening food security electricity generation and water supply paredes trejo et al 2021 rodrigues et al 2020 the impacts of such changes on surface water availability and how meteorological droughts propagate to hydrological droughts in brazil are largely unknown in this paper we i identify and quantify meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics ii estimate the recovery time for meteorological and hydrological droughts and iii calculate the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological droughts in 457 hydrographic basins throughout brazil we use a multi indicator approach that combines the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and the standardized streamflow index ssi to analyze drought propagation based on differences in drought onset the center of mass and time to peak 2 material and methods 2 1 study area we analyze 457 hydrographic basins across the brazilian territory fig 1 a most basin areas 51 are between 1 500 km2 and 10 000 km2 35 of them between 10 000 km2 and 100 000 km2 and few 14 are more than 100 000 km2 the wettest regions are the amazon and with precipitation over 2000 mm per year fig 1b and streamflow higher than 1000 mm per year fig 1c the northeast is the driest region with precipitation ranging between 600 mm and 1200 mm and streamflow less than 300 mm 2 2 precipitation and streamflow data we use daily precipitation p data grids from xavier et al 2016 within the brazilian territory and from climate prediction center cpc outside the brazilian territory xavier et al 2016 dataset spatial resolution is 0 25 while the cpc dataset resolution is 0 50 both precipitation products were computed using interpolation of hydrometeorological gauges potential evapotranspiration pet daily data grid is from the global land evaporation amsterdam model v3 3a gleam martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 with a resolution of 0 25 we compute daily p and pet for each basin by averaging the cells within the basin boundaries which we define using the digital elevation model from the srtm shuttle radar topographic mission usgs 2006 we analyze streamflow data from the camels br dataset chagas et al 2020 where only basins with less than 30 of missing data are considered and gauges with unrealistic streamflow values are removed 2 3 drought indices and characteristics as the indicator for meteorological droughts we use the spei vicente serrano et al 2010 by estimating a simplified water balance using precipitation minus pet we then aggregate the water balance over different timescales 1 to 12 months and fit it to a parametric probability distribution the drought index is obtained by using the inverse of the standard normal distribution the ssi shukla and wood 2008 vicente serrano et al 2012 indicates hydrological droughts and its calculation follows the same principles of spei but only uses streamflow data in this paper we calculate the spei and ssi for the accumulation period of 1 to 12 months furthermore according to the literature recommendation we choose the generalized extreme distribution gev as the parametric distribution stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2012 for both indices spei i and ssi i denote the i month where i 1 2 12 accumulation period spei and ssi respectively for each basin we compute the total number of meteorological drought events their duration severity and recovery time fig 2 a the same computations are used for hydrological droughts using ssi we define the start of a drought event as when the spei or ssi falls below the threshold of 1 the event ends when the index goes back to zero or more drought duration is the time from the beginning to the end of a drought event the severity of an event is the sum of the spei or ssi values for each month during a drought event the recovery time r time consists of how long it takes for a drought event to reach its end once it has reached its peak fig 2a the r time is estimated by subtracting the peak time t peak by the end time t end we divide the recovery time of the hydrological drought by that of the meteorological drought to estimate the recovery rate for each basin i e how many times more a hydrological drought takes to recover in comparison to a meteorological drought moreover we use the mann kendall test with a significance level of 0 05 mann 1945 kendall 1975 to test for trends and the theil sen slope theil 1950 sen 1968 to calculate the magnitude of trends in the spei and ssi series of each basin 2 4 drought propagation following on from fig 2 we analyze the propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts using three different methods following barker et al 2016 we compare the spei and ssi series to estimate the time it takes for a precipitation deficit to affect the streamflow this is achieved by evaluating the pearson s correlation coefficients between the spei 1 to spei 12 series with respect to the ssi 1 to avoid potentially spurious correlations chatfield 2016 the underlying trendlines in spei and ssi series are removed using the theil sen slope theil 1950 sen 1968 the second method consists of calculating three indicators of the propagation time fig 2b according to i the time difference between the beginnings δ b of a meteorological and a hydrological drought event ii the time difference between the peaks δ p of those events iii the time difference between the ends δ e of those events we analyze i the events in which the meteorological drought begins before the hydrological drought ii we considered that a hydrological drought is due to a meteorological drought if it starts before the meteorological drought ended iii we also analyzed just the events where the peak and the end of meteorological drought occur before the peak and end of hydrological drought fig 2e lastly in the third method we estimate the propagation time using the center of mass of the drought event we calculate the center of mass of the same meteorological and hydrological drought events then we compute the time difference between the center of mass of the hydrological and meteorological droughts events δ c fig 2b the propagation time for each basin is the average of the time differences between the center of masses 3 results and discussion 3 1 drought characteristics fig 3 shows spei and ssi time series at the 6 month time scale for every basin by visually exploring the time series it becomes clear that meteorological droughts do not always lead to hydrological droughts especially when the meteorological drought lasts for up to three months many short scale meteorological droughts are attenuated by the catchment and consequently there are more meteorological droughts than hydrological ones on the other hand hydrological droughts can last longer in comparison to meteorological ones similar results can be seen at the time scales of 3 month and 12 month figs s1 and s2 from 2012 onwards major long lasting drought events have affected the southeast and the northeast regions gutiérrez et al 2014 melo et al 2016 marengo et al 2017 de brito et al 2021 in fact the number of drought events and their severity has become more severe in those regions particularly in the são francisco basin as can be seen by the trend analysis fig s3 spei and ssi values have been increasing in northern amazon and southern brazil while they have been decreasing elsewhere 72 of the spei and 76 of the ssi trends are statistically significant significance level α 0 05 these results are similar to brasil neto et al 2021 for the spi in the state of paraiba in northeastern brazil trends in hydrological droughts are more pronounced than those in meteorological droughts which implies that other drivers e g land use change and water use also influence the development of hydrological droughts meteorological droughts in brazil are twice as frequent as hydrological droughts fig 4 on average there are 17 meteorological droughts and 8 5 hydrological droughts per basin between 1980 and 2015 on the other hand hydrological droughts are longer on average 14 6 months each than meteorological droughts on average 8 4 months each as many sequential short scale droughts are either pooled into a single longer hydrological drought or attenuated by the basin as the spei and ssi accumulation periods increase so do drought duration and severity while the opposite occurs for the number of events fig s5 and s6 the wet regions amazon and southern brazil present the longest between 10 and 15 months and most severe meteorological droughts the dry regions são francisco and northeastern brazil are characterized by a high number of short meteorological droughts between 15 and 25 events lasting from 5 to 10 months each which are commonly grouped close to each other while there is a close match between spatial patterns of annual rainfall and streamflow in brazil i e fig 1b and c the characteristics of hydrological droughts are substantially different than those of meteorological droughts in fact hydrological drought characteristics are not well explained by meteorological droughts as the spearman correlation between the number of meteorological and hydrological drought events is 0 14 or 0 15 for the duration of events fig s4 the spatial distribution of hydrological droughts is not as smooth as the meteorological ones which indicates the fundamental importance of catchment attributes in drought propagation hydrological drought severity is highly influenced by terrestrial hydrological processes and anthropogenic activities van loon and laaha 2014 in brazil it has been shown that changes in land cover such as deforestation can intensify drought severity bagley et al 2014 and that reservoirs influences drought propagation melo et al 2016 future studies should investigate those drivers of hydrological droughts as opposed to meteorological droughts the longest and most severe hydrological droughts are in the southeastern and northeastern regions with great variability between basins fig 4 the highest differences between spei and ssi total number of events average duration and average severity occur in the são francisco and eastern atlantic regions fig 5 the uruguay and the amazon basins on the other hand have similar spei and ssi characteristics 3 2 recovery time fig 6 a shows that as expected hydrological droughts take more time to recover than meteorological droughts in most basins 77 however in 23 of the basins most of them in the amazon the average recovery time of meteorological droughts is higher than hydrological ones as it was observed for the drought characteristics the average recovery times of hydrological droughts are not correlated with those from meteorological droughts spearman correlation of 0 06 fig s4 it shows that catchment attributes are also fundamental to the recovery of drought events the recovery rate in fig 6b defined here as the ratio between the average recovery time for ssi and spei indicates on average how many times longer it takes for a hydrological drought to recover compared to its generating meteorological drought event they are between 1 and 2 for 47 of the basins and higher than 2 for 29 of the basins for some basins in the são francisco region hydrological droughts can take over four times more to recover again recovery time has high spatial variability in the são francisco while a lower variability in the uruguay region we hypothesize that regions with higher variability in recovery time are more vulnerable to droughts than the ones with lower variability 3 3 propagation time the propagation time indices are useful indicators of the relative differences across regions however the absolute value of the propagation time depends completely on the method being used fig 7 the propagation time using spei n fig 7d considers the month accumulation with the highest correlation with ssi 1 correlations for spei accumulation periods of 1 to 12 months with ssi 1 are shown in fig s7 the spei n average value is usually between δ e the longest time as ssi takes longer to recover fig 7c and that of δ c and δ p both of which produce similar values fig 7e and b the time to onset δ b fig 7a is not a sensitive index compared to the others and provides the lowest and most smoothed out values for the propagation time these results indicate that using the propagation time as calculated by the difference in time to onset δ b may not be a good predictor of the time to reach the peak nor the end of a hydrological drought event in comparison to the meteorological one those relative differences among indices are consistent for other accumulation periods results not shown however as the accumulation period increases the average propagation time usually increases as well due to averaging effects the results using spei n fig 7d show that while the propagation time of 2 months was the most common 119 basins for most of the basins the propagation time was considerably higher ranging from 6 to 12 months these results contrast with that of barker et al 2016 and zeng et al 2015 who found a spei n of 1 month for most basins in the uk and china respectively for the e atlantic são francisco and the north region of parana in which the propagation time is predominantly high 6 12 months high correlations are observed from the third month onwards spei n of 1 to 6 months accumulation are highly correlated with ssi 1 in the south atlantic uruguay and the south region of parana indicating that the effects on the streamflow are persistent and can be noticed from the first month of drought additionally there is a low correlation for these values for all accumulation periods in northern amazon and são francisco which indicate either a high influence of catchment attributes or anthropogenic interference the e atlantic and são francisco regions are the driest regions in the country and where propagation time is slower the propagation time is relatively faster in the wetter regions such as s atlantic uruguay northern amazon and tocantins the relationship between the propagation time basin area and the average annual precipitation of the basins is presented in fig s8 there is no clear relationship between the propagation time and the basin area similar to what barker et al 2016 found for the uk basins moreover differently from barker et al 2016 there is no relationship between the propagation time and the average annual precipitation the average propagation time using the difference in the onset time of the events is less than the results found for the spei n with a propagation time of fewer than 6 months for 91 of the basins fig 7a using the difference in time of the peak the time of propagation of 65 of the basins is also below 6 months similar results for the difference in center of mass fig 7b and e while in the case of difference in the end time the value for most basins varies from 6 to 12 months these results again corroborate that the onset of droughts is usually quicker and not a good estimator of time to peak and recovery moreover the similar correlation found for various spei n and the differences in time of propagation methods indicates the importance of considering the complexity of the drought phenomena and the several sources of uncertainty when characterizing it 4 conclusion in this paper we use a multi indicator framework to identify and analyze droughts in 457 brazilian basins we calculate meteorological and hydrological characteristics and estimate the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought events by comparing different methodologies our results show that meteorological droughts are more frequent and less severe than hydrological droughts in most of the territory while short scale meteorological drought events can be attenuated by the catchment and may ultimately not propagate to a hydrological drought a sequence of those events may lead to longer and more severe hydrological droughts moreover trends in hydrological droughts are more pronounced than what would be expected from trends in meteorological droughts alone highlighting the importance of considering other drivers of hydrological droughts such as land and water use recovery time and recovery rate vary depending on the region and severity of the drought event the recovery time of hydrological drought events is on average twice that of meteorological ones the variability and high values of recovery rate are especially noticeable in são francisco one of the driest regions and paraná a region highly impacted by human activities there are several basins for which propagation time are greater than 4 months which is considerably higher than what has been previously estimated in the literature it became clear that the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought can vary considerably depending on the index chosen for the calculation for example the difference in timing of onset of meteorological and hydrological droughts is shorter than that using the timing in peak severity or the end of the event therefore while we can have an estimate of the onset of hydrological drought it is much harder to predict how much longer a hydrological drought will last in comparison to meteorological droughts these results suggest that only using meteorological droughts is not sufficient to fully characterize droughts multi indicator

4169,meteorological droughts propagate through the hydrological cycle causing hydrological droughts and societal impacts however the effects of climate and basin characteristics on hydrologic drought propagation vary regionally and remain largely unclear in this paper we characterize meteorological and hydrological droughts in 457 basins in brazil using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardized streamflow index ssi we investigate hydrologic drought propagation based on differences in drought onset the center of mass and time to peak additionally we estimate the recovery time of meteorological and hydrologic drought events the results indicate that hydrological droughts are usually more long lasting severe and with a slower recovery time compared to meteorological droughts while the most severe meteorological droughts are observed in humid regions e g amazon and southern brazil the most severe and long lasting hydrological droughts are found in the driest region i e northeast brazil or mostly impacted by human activities i e southeast brazil hydrological droughts in dry regions can take four times longer to recover than meteorological ones for most regions the propagation time was slightly different considering the different approaches our results highlight the importance of a multi indicator approach to fully characterize the mechanisms controlling the development and propagation of droughts through the water cycle keywords drought propagation meteorological drought hydrological drought standardized drought indices brazil 1 introduction droughts are associated with major economic losses and damages to the ecosystem wilhite 2000 between 1970 and 2012 droughts were responsible for approximately one third of deaths related to natural disasters and an economic loss of 200 billion dollars worldwide wmo 2014 they threaten food production energy generation water supply and can intensify wildfires and tree mortality doughty et al 2015 melo et al 2016 taufik et al 2017 brás et al 2019 thus improving drought characterization is crucial to enhance its monitoring management and prediction drought is defined as the period in which water availability is below what would be normally expected and fails to meet human or environmental needs wilhite and pulwarty 2018 these events are broadly classified into four categories wilhite and glantz 1985 i meteorological drought associated with negative anomalies in precipitation ii agricultural drought related to a decline in soil moisture iii hydrological drought when there is a deficit in the streamflow iv socio economic drought when events have socio economic impacts several drought indices have been developed to identify characterize and compare these events for example the world meteorological organization wmo recommends the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 for monitoring meteorological droughts hayes et al 2011 for hydrological droughts the standardized streamflow index ssi shukla and wood 2008 vicente serrano et al 2012 is commonly used yet since droughts are related to more than a single variable using only one variable index may lead to an incomplete analysis therefore several multivariate indices have been created vicente serrano et al 2010 hao and aghakouchak 2014 typically negative anomalies in precipitation propagate slowly through the hydrological cycle giving rise to hydrological drought this process is denoted as drought propagation eltahir and yeh 1999 and depends on the climate biophysical and geographic properties of the region as well as anthropogenic influences wu et al 2021 it is well known that under limited or no anthropogenic influences drought propagation is primarily controlled by the climate and biophysical characteristics of the hydrographic basin van loon 2015 van lanen et al 2013 in addition human activities such as land cover change dams irrigation and urbanization can significantly alter hydrological processes e g evaporation infiltration and consequently drought propagation van loon et al 2016 numerous studies have attempted to model and understand drought propagation and its drivers apurv and cai 2020 wu et al 2021 barker et al 2016 found that in the united kingdom propagation time from meteorological to hydrological droughts was mostly one or two months with basins with large aquifers showing a longer propagation time a similar propagation time was found by zeng et al 2015 in the jialing river basin xu et al 2019 showed that for a basin in china human changes such as the increase in domestic water supply and the expansion of urbanization decreased drought propagation time while agriculture activities increased it land cover can also have a strong influence on the propagation time wu et al 2018 forest areas presented a longer propagation time while pasture areas had a slower propagation for basins in china moreover climate and land use changes are the major aspects that modify drought propagation zhou et al 2019 wu et al 2020 outlined a framework for hydrological drought recovery analysis based on a drought propagation perspective however the absence of a standard methodology to calculate the time of propagation and the limited understanding of how meteorological droughts develop into hydrological droughts hinders the analysis monitoring and development of early warning systems barker et al 2016 brazil is particularly vulnerable to droughts given that hydroelectricity corresponds to 70 of its energy generation and irrigated agriculture is 32 of the country s water use getirana 2016 melo et al 2016 recently most brazilian regions faced the most severe and intense droughts of the last 60 years cunha et al 2019 the northeast region has suffered severe impacts due to the 2013 drought the worst in 100 years which affected agriculture and livestock gutiérrez et al 2014 in southeastern brazil the 2014 drought compromised the water supply of 28 million people melo et al 2016 water consumption and climatic changes are predicted to intensify droughts even more marengo et al 2017 morales et al 2020 threatening food security electricity generation and water supply paredes trejo et al 2021 rodrigues et al 2020 the impacts of such changes on surface water availability and how meteorological droughts propagate to hydrological droughts in brazil are largely unknown in this paper we i identify and quantify meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics ii estimate the recovery time for meteorological and hydrological droughts and iii calculate the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological droughts in 457 hydrographic basins throughout brazil we use a multi indicator approach that combines the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and the standardized streamflow index ssi to analyze drought propagation based on differences in drought onset the center of mass and time to peak 2 material and methods 2 1 study area we analyze 457 hydrographic basins across the brazilian territory fig 1 a most basin areas 51 are between 1 500 km2 and 10 000 km2 35 of them between 10 000 km2 and 100 000 km2 and few 14 are more than 100 000 km2 the wettest regions are the amazon and with precipitation over 2000 mm per year fig 1b and streamflow higher than 1000 mm per year fig 1c the northeast is the driest region with precipitation ranging between 600 mm and 1200 mm and streamflow less than 300 mm 2 2 precipitation and streamflow data we use daily precipitation p data grids from xavier et al 2016 within the brazilian territory and from climate prediction center cpc outside the brazilian territory xavier et al 2016 dataset spatial resolution is 0 25 while the cpc dataset resolution is 0 50 both precipitation products were computed using interpolation of hydrometeorological gauges potential evapotranspiration pet daily data grid is from the global land evaporation amsterdam model v3 3a gleam martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 with a resolution of 0 25 we compute daily p and pet for each basin by averaging the cells within the basin boundaries which we define using the digital elevation model from the srtm shuttle radar topographic mission usgs 2006 we analyze streamflow data from the camels br dataset chagas et al 2020 where only basins with less than 30 of missing data are considered and gauges with unrealistic streamflow values are removed 2 3 drought indices and characteristics as the indicator for meteorological droughts we use the spei vicente serrano et al 2010 by estimating a simplified water balance using precipitation minus pet we then aggregate the water balance over different timescales 1 to 12 months and fit it to a parametric probability distribution the drought index is obtained by using the inverse of the standard normal distribution the ssi shukla and wood 2008 vicente serrano et al 2012 indicates hydrological droughts and its calculation follows the same principles of spei but only uses streamflow data in this paper we calculate the spei and ssi for the accumulation period of 1 to 12 months furthermore according to the literature recommendation we choose the generalized extreme distribution gev as the parametric distribution stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2012 for both indices spei i and ssi i denote the i month where i 1 2 12 accumulation period spei and ssi respectively for each basin we compute the total number of meteorological drought events their duration severity and recovery time fig 2 a the same computations are used for hydrological droughts using ssi we define the start of a drought event as when the spei or ssi falls below the threshold of 1 the event ends when the index goes back to zero or more drought duration is the time from the beginning to the end of a drought event the severity of an event is the sum of the spei or ssi values for each month during a drought event the recovery time r time consists of how long it takes for a drought event to reach its end once it has reached its peak fig 2a the r time is estimated by subtracting the peak time t peak by the end time t end we divide the recovery time of the hydrological drought by that of the meteorological drought to estimate the recovery rate for each basin i e how many times more a hydrological drought takes to recover in comparison to a meteorological drought moreover we use the mann kendall test with a significance level of 0 05 mann 1945 kendall 1975 to test for trends and the theil sen slope theil 1950 sen 1968 to calculate the magnitude of trends in the spei and ssi series of each basin 2 4 drought propagation following on from fig 2 we analyze the propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts using three different methods following barker et al 2016 we compare the spei and ssi series to estimate the time it takes for a precipitation deficit to affect the streamflow this is achieved by evaluating the pearson s correlation coefficients between the spei 1 to spei 12 series with respect to the ssi 1 to avoid potentially spurious correlations chatfield 2016 the underlying trendlines in spei and ssi series are removed using the theil sen slope theil 1950 sen 1968 the second method consists of calculating three indicators of the propagation time fig 2b according to i the time difference between the beginnings δ b of a meteorological and a hydrological drought event ii the time difference between the peaks δ p of those events iii the time difference between the ends δ e of those events we analyze i the events in which the meteorological drought begins before the hydrological drought ii we considered that a hydrological drought is due to a meteorological drought if it starts before the meteorological drought ended iii we also analyzed just the events where the peak and the end of meteorological drought occur before the peak and end of hydrological drought fig 2e lastly in the third method we estimate the propagation time using the center of mass of the drought event we calculate the center of mass of the same meteorological and hydrological drought events then we compute the time difference between the center of mass of the hydrological and meteorological droughts events δ c fig 2b the propagation time for each basin is the average of the time differences between the center of masses 3 results and discussion 3 1 drought characteristics fig 3 shows spei and ssi time series at the 6 month time scale for every basin by visually exploring the time series it becomes clear that meteorological droughts do not always lead to hydrological droughts especially when the meteorological drought lasts for up to three months many short scale meteorological droughts are attenuated by the catchment and consequently there are more meteorological droughts than hydrological ones on the other hand hydrological droughts can last longer in comparison to meteorological ones similar results can be seen at the time scales of 3 month and 12 month figs s1 and s2 from 2012 onwards major long lasting drought events have affected the southeast and the northeast regions gutiérrez et al 2014 melo et al 2016 marengo et al 2017 de brito et al 2021 in fact the number of drought events and their severity has become more severe in those regions particularly in the são francisco basin as can be seen by the trend analysis fig s3 spei and ssi values have been increasing in northern amazon and southern brazil while they have been decreasing elsewhere 72 of the spei and 76 of the ssi trends are statistically significant significance level α 0 05 these results are similar to brasil neto et al 2021 for the spi in the state of paraiba in northeastern brazil trends in hydrological droughts are more pronounced than those in meteorological droughts which implies that other drivers e g land use change and water use also influence the development of hydrological droughts meteorological droughts in brazil are twice as frequent as hydrological droughts fig 4 on average there are 17 meteorological droughts and 8 5 hydrological droughts per basin between 1980 and 2015 on the other hand hydrological droughts are longer on average 14 6 months each than meteorological droughts on average 8 4 months each as many sequential short scale droughts are either pooled into a single longer hydrological drought or attenuated by the basin as the spei and ssi accumulation periods increase so do drought duration and severity while the opposite occurs for the number of events fig s5 and s6 the wet regions amazon and southern brazil present the longest between 10 and 15 months and most severe meteorological droughts the dry regions são francisco and northeastern brazil are characterized by a high number of short meteorological droughts between 15 and 25 events lasting from 5 to 10 months each which are commonly grouped close to each other while there is a close match between spatial patterns of annual rainfall and streamflow in brazil i e fig 1b and c the characteristics of hydrological droughts are substantially different than those of meteorological droughts in fact hydrological drought characteristics are not well explained by meteorological droughts as the spearman correlation between the number of meteorological and hydrological drought events is 0 14 or 0 15 for the duration of events fig s4 the spatial distribution of hydrological droughts is not as smooth as the meteorological ones which indicates the fundamental importance of catchment attributes in drought propagation hydrological drought severity is highly influenced by terrestrial hydrological processes and anthropogenic activities van loon and laaha 2014 in brazil it has been shown that changes in land cover such as deforestation can intensify drought severity bagley et al 2014 and that reservoirs influences drought propagation melo et al 2016 future studies should investigate those drivers of hydrological droughts as opposed to meteorological droughts the longest and most severe hydrological droughts are in the southeastern and northeastern regions with great variability between basins fig 4 the highest differences between spei and ssi total number of events average duration and average severity occur in the são francisco and eastern atlantic regions fig 5 the uruguay and the amazon basins on the other hand have similar spei and ssi characteristics 3 2 recovery time fig 6 a shows that as expected hydrological droughts take more time to recover than meteorological droughts in most basins 77 however in 23 of the basins most of them in the amazon the average recovery time of meteorological droughts is higher than hydrological ones as it was observed for the drought characteristics the average recovery times of hydrological droughts are not correlated with those from meteorological droughts spearman correlation of 0 06 fig s4 it shows that catchment attributes are also fundamental to the recovery of drought events the recovery rate in fig 6b defined here as the ratio between the average recovery time for ssi and spei indicates on average how many times longer it takes for a hydrological drought to recover compared to its generating meteorological drought event they are between 1 and 2 for 47 of the basins and higher than 2 for 29 of the basins for some basins in the são francisco region hydrological droughts can take over four times more to recover again recovery time has high spatial variability in the são francisco while a lower variability in the uruguay region we hypothesize that regions with higher variability in recovery time are more vulnerable to droughts than the ones with lower variability 3 3 propagation time the propagation time indices are useful indicators of the relative differences across regions however the absolute value of the propagation time depends completely on the method being used fig 7 the propagation time using spei n fig 7d considers the month accumulation with the highest correlation with ssi 1 correlations for spei accumulation periods of 1 to 12 months with ssi 1 are shown in fig s7 the spei n average value is usually between δ e the longest time as ssi takes longer to recover fig 7c and that of δ c and δ p both of which produce similar values fig 7e and b the time to onset δ b fig 7a is not a sensitive index compared to the others and provides the lowest and most smoothed out values for the propagation time these results indicate that using the propagation time as calculated by the difference in time to onset δ b may not be a good predictor of the time to reach the peak nor the end of a hydrological drought event in comparison to the meteorological one those relative differences among indices are consistent for other accumulation periods results not shown however as the accumulation period increases the average propagation time usually increases as well due to averaging effects the results using spei n fig 7d show that while the propagation time of 2 months was the most common 119 basins for most of the basins the propagation time was considerably higher ranging from 6 to 12 months these results contrast with that of barker et al 2016 and zeng et al 2015 who found a spei n of 1 month for most basins in the uk and china respectively for the e atlantic são francisco and the north region of parana in which the propagation time is predominantly high 6 12 months high correlations are observed from the third month onwards spei n of 1 to 6 months accumulation are highly correlated with ssi 1 in the south atlantic uruguay and the south region of parana indicating that the effects on the streamflow are persistent and can be noticed from the first month of drought additionally there is a low correlation for these values for all accumulation periods in northern amazon and são francisco which indicate either a high influence of catchment attributes or anthropogenic interference the e atlantic and são francisco regions are the driest regions in the country and where propagation time is slower the propagation time is relatively faster in the wetter regions such as s atlantic uruguay northern amazon and tocantins the relationship between the propagation time basin area and the average annual precipitation of the basins is presented in fig s8 there is no clear relationship between the propagation time and the basin area similar to what barker et al 2016 found for the uk basins moreover differently from barker et al 2016 there is no relationship between the propagation time and the average annual precipitation the average propagation time using the difference in the onset time of the events is less than the results found for the spei n with a propagation time of fewer than 6 months for 91 of the basins fig 7a using the difference in time of the peak the time of propagation of 65 of the basins is also below 6 months similar results for the difference in center of mass fig 7b and e while in the case of difference in the end time the value for most basins varies from 6 to 12 months these results again corroborate that the onset of droughts is usually quicker and not a good estimator of time to peak and recovery moreover the similar correlation found for various spei n and the differences in time of propagation methods indicates the importance of considering the complexity of the drought phenomena and the several sources of uncertainty when characterizing it 4 conclusion in this paper we use a multi indicator framework to identify and analyze droughts in 457 brazilian basins we calculate meteorological and hydrological characteristics and estimate the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought events by comparing different methodologies our results show that meteorological droughts are more frequent and less severe than hydrological droughts in most of the territory while short scale meteorological drought events can be attenuated by the catchment and may ultimately not propagate to a hydrological drought a sequence of those events may lead to longer and more severe hydrological droughts moreover trends in hydrological droughts are more pronounced than what would be expected from trends in meteorological droughts alone highlighting the importance of considering other drivers of hydrological droughts such as land and water use recovery time and recovery rate vary depending on the region and severity of the drought event the recovery time of hydrological drought events is on average twice that of meteorological ones the variability and high values of recovery rate are especially noticeable in são francisco one of the driest regions and paraná a region highly impacted by human activities there are several basins for which propagation time are greater than 4 months which is considerably higher than what has been previously estimated in the literature it became clear that the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought can vary considerably depending on the index chosen for the calculation for example the difference in timing of onset of meteorological and hydrological droughts is shorter than that using the timing in peak severity or the end of the event therefore while we can have an estimate of the onset of hydrological drought it is much harder to predict how much longer a hydrological drought will last in comparison to meteorological droughts these results suggest that only using meteorological droughts is not sufficient to fully characterize droughts multi indicator approaches are necessary to determine the mechanisms of drought development and propagation through the water cycle credit authorship contribution statement alena g bevacqua data curation
