the shorter region 412 bp was chosen for novel primer design the peaks and troughs of nucleotide diversity fig 2a reflect a high degree of variation of putative geoa genes among the cyanobacteria genera independent sliding window analysis performed on each major clade identified by ml clustering fig 1 showed significant genetic diversity except in the d ucrainicum like clade including d circinale and d planctonicum fig 2b nucleotide identity heat map fig 2c of all geoa sequences identified 60 99 nucleotide sequence identity across all taxa based on sliding window analysis of the d ucrainicum clade new pcr primers i e geo799f geo927f internal to geo78f geo982r were designed a primer blast analysis of geo799f geo927f suggests that the new primers can amplify geoa genes in d ucrainicum and other cyanobacteria species such as d circinale d planctonicum and presumably aphanizomenon gracile to further validate the newly synthesised primers genomic dna from a subset of geoa positive n 12 and geoa negative n 5 samples were tested by pcr using the newly designed geo799f geo927f primers a subsequent validation step of geo799f geo927f primer set was performed on all previously amplified pcr amplicons generated from geo 78f 982r geo78f geo971r and geo250f geo971r along with d circinalis awqc ana 131cr and n punctiforme pcc73102 using pcr the new primers amplified an expected product of 129 bp confirmed by sequencing for all geoa positive samples as well as for positive controls i e d circinale awqc ana 131cr and n punctiforme pcc73102 that were detected using any of the three separate primers in the current study figs s3 and s4 4 discussion in the present study we undertook a geoa based genetic screening of 253 environmental samples using pcr collected over a period of six years from 115 different locations around victoria australia we identified four different putative geoa sequence types using three different primer sets based on blastn blastx searches and clustering analysis d ucrainicum a filamentous planktonic cyanobacterium of the order nostocales was identified as the dominant type over all six years of study our results agree with other global reports otten et al 2016 wang et al 2014 indicating d ucrainicum as a particularly common geosmin producer and with previous studies showing geosmin are usually produced by species belonging to filamentous cyanobacteria of the order nostocales or oscillatoriales giglio et al 2008 suurnäkki et al 2015 the primers i e geo78f geo250f geo971r and geo982r used in this study have previously been shown to identify most geosmin producers from either nostocales or oscillatoriales however none of our samples yielded a pcr product identified through blast search to be from a species of oscillatoriales the most likely explanation for this is that most known geosmin producing species of the order oscillatoriales e g species of planktothrix oscillatoria geitlerinema lyngbya and phormidium are benthic hobson et al 2010 jüttner and watson 2007 and all samples tested in our study were from planktonic blooms subsequent screening of benthic cyanobacterial mats for additional geoa sequence types should be undertaken phylogenetic analysis fig 1 clustered all sequences from the current study and previously published for geoa in genbank into four primary clades all d ucrainicum sequences i e 53 sequences from current study clustered with geoa sequences previously annotated as d ucrainicum d circinale and d planctonicum several novel geoa sequence types that did not cluster closely with known geosmin producing cyanobacteria were also identified in this study e g unknown bacterium uom78 and uom79 these sequences likely represent a presently uncharacterized geosmin producing species that should be pursued in subsequent study a sliding window analysis focusing on d ucrainicum clade including d circinale and d planctonicum identified several suitable regions for conserved primer design we targeted a 129 bp region from position 799 to 927 bp of the geoa gene comprehensive testing of all 253 samples showed that the new primer set was able to amplify all geoa positive samples detected using the three separate primer pairs giglio et al 2008 suurnäkki et al 2015 including the two positive controls i e d circinale awqc ana 131cr and n punctiforme pcc73102 moreover a primer blast analysis indicated that the new primers should also amplify geoa genes of d planctonicum and aphanizomenon gracile based on our results this new geoa pcr is a suitable single protocol tool for broad detection of the major geosmin producing cyanobacteria given the small size of the novel geo799 927 amplicon developed herein 130bp and its consistency across numerous taxa the current primer set is likely to support development of a geoa targeted quantitative pcr qpcr as has been developed recently for a number of cyanotoxin biosynthetic genes baker et al 2013 a geoa targeted qpcr would have significant utility in understanding the abundance of geosmin producing cyanobacteria in a bloom and their spatial and temporal distribution as well as providing a basis for exploring variability in geoa gene expression patterns yielding insights into the function and timing of geosmin synthesis giglio et al 2008 2011 su et al 2013 tsao et al 2014 watson et al 2016 although qpcr assays detecting geoa genes have been previously developed they are targeted to a select range of species such as d circinale awqc318 giglio et al 2011 dolichopsermum sp su et al 2013 d circinale tsao et al 2014 and d lemmermannii kutovaya and watson 2014 and have shown applicability in environmental samples while our method detects potential geosmin producing cyanobacteria in environmental samples this study has not directly demonstrated using direct chemical analysis or rna expression studies the potential of pcr positive samples to produce geosmin however it is worth noting that previous studies giglio et al 2011 su et al 2013 tsao et al 2014 have shown strong correlation between cyanobacterial samples encoding the geosmin synthase gene and geosmin production and therefore this study justifies the use of the newly designed primer pair as an effective tool to monitor potential geosmin producing cyanobacteria furthermore recent studies graham et al 2010 suurnäkki et al 2015 have reported that toxigenic and t o producing cyanobacteria tend to co exist within a bloom this provides scope for incorporating the current short geoa amplicon into an existing multiplex tandem pcr tool developed previously for routine monitoring of toxigenic cyanobacteria baker et al 2013 allowing simultaneous monitoring of cyanotoxins as well as geosmin in a single standardised platform a similar approach may also be developed to identify the major producers of other t o compounds such as mib 5 conclusions we screened 253 environmental bloom samples from different locations in victoria australia using pcr to understand the genetic diversity of geosmin producing cyanobacteria our results indicate that d ucrainicum is an important geosmin contributor in various water resources across victoria our study supported development of a novel small amplicon pcr primer set able to broadly identify all geosmin producing cyanobacteria identified in the current study using a single protocol this newly designed tool may now be explored for development as a quantitative assay and packaged with existing qpcr assays targeting cyanotoxin biosynthetic gene clusters providing a much needed tool for routine monitoring of surface water quality our study further emphasises the necessity to identify sequence yet uncharacterized geosmin producing cyanobacteria and better designing of pcr primers to systematically detect all geoa genes conflict of interest authors declare no conflict of interest authors contributions manuscript written by n j n

the shorter region 412 bp was chosen for novel primer design the peaks and troughs of nucleotide diversity fig 2a reflect a high degree of variation of putative geoa genes among the cyanobacteria genera independent sliding window analysis performed on each major clade identified by ml clustering fig 1 showed significant genetic diversity except in the d ucrainicum like clade including d circinale and d planctonicum fig 2b nucleotide identity heat map fig 2c of all geoa sequences identified 60 99 nucleotide sequence identity across all taxa based on sliding window analysis of the d ucrainicum clade new pcr primers i e geo799f geo927f internal to geo78f geo982r were designed a primer blast analysis of geo799f geo927f suggests that the new primers can amplify geoa genes in d ucrainicum and other cyanobacteria species such as d circinale d planctonicum and presumably aphanizomenon gracile to further validate the newly synthesised primers genomic dna from a subset of geoa positive n 12 and geoa negative n 5 samples were tested by pcr using the newly designed geo799f geo927f primers a subsequent validation step of geo799f geo927f primer set was performed on all previously amplified pcr amplicons generated from geo 78f 982r geo78f geo971r and geo250f geo971r along with d circinalis awqc ana 131cr and n punctiforme pcc73102 using pcr the new primers amplified an expected product of 129 bp confirmed by sequencing for all geoa positive samples as well as for positive controls i e d circinale awqc ana 131cr and n punctiforme pcc73102 that were detected using any of the three separate primers in the current study figs s3 and s4 4 discussion in the present study we undertook a geoa based genetic screening of 253 environmental samples using pcr collected over a period of six years from 115 different locations around victoria australia we identified four different putative geoa sequence types using three different primer sets based on blastn blastx searches and clustering analysis d ucrainicum a filamentous planktonic cyanobacterium of the order nostocales was identified as the dominant type over all six years of study our results agree with other global reports otten et al 2016 wang et al 2014 indicating d ucrainicum as a particularly common geosmin producer and with previous studies showing geosmin are usually produced by species belonging to filamentous cyanobacteria of the order nostocales or oscillatoriales giglio et al 2008 suurnäkki et al 2015 the primers i e geo78f geo250f geo971r and geo982r used in this study have previously been shown to identify most geosmin producers from either nostocales or oscillatoriales however none of our samples yielded a pcr product identified through blast search to be from a species of oscillatoriales the most likely explanation for this is that most known geosmin producing species of the order oscillatoriales e g species of planktothrix oscillatoria geitlerinema lyngbya and phormidium are benthic hobson et al 2010 jüttner and watson 2007 and all samples tested in our study were from planktonic blooms subsequent screening of benthic cyanobacterial mats for additional geoa sequence types should be undertaken phylogenetic analysis fig 1 clustered all sequences from the current study and previously published for geoa in genbank into four primary clades all d ucrainicum sequences i e 53 sequences from current study clustered with geoa sequences previously annotated as d ucrainicum d circinale and d planctonicum several novel geoa sequence types that did not cluster closely with known geosmin producing cyanobacteria were also identified in this study e g unknown bacterium uom78 and uom79 these sequences likely represent a presently uncharacterized geosmin producing species that should be pursued in subsequent study a sliding window analysis focusing on d ucrainicum clade including d circinale and d planctonicum identified several suitable regions for conserved primer design we targeted a 129 bp region from position 799 to 927 bp of the geoa gene comprehensive testing of all 253 samples showed that the new primer set was able to amplify all geoa positive samples detected using the three separate primer pairs giglio et al 2008 suurnäkki et al 2015 including the two positive controls i e d circinale awqc ana 131cr and n punctiforme pcc73102 moreover a primer blast analysis indicated that the new primers should also amplify geoa genes of d planctonicum and aphanizomenon gracile based on our results this new geoa pcr is a suitable single protocol tool for broad detection of the major geosmin producing cyanobacteria given the small size of the novel geo799 927 amplicon developed herein 130bp and its consistency across numerous taxa the current primer set is likely to support development of a geoa targeted quantitative pcr qpcr as has been developed recently for a number of cyanotoxin biosynthetic genes baker et al 2013 a geoa targeted qpcr would have significant utility in understanding the abundance of geosmin producing cyanobacteria in a bloom and their spatial and temporal distribution as well as providing a basis for exploring variability in geoa gene expression patterns yielding insights into the function and timing of geosmin synthesis giglio et al 2008 2011 su et al 2013 tsao et al 2014 watson et al 2016 although qpcr assays detecting geoa genes have been previously developed they are targeted to a select range of species such as d circinale awqc318 giglio et al 2011 dolichopsermum sp su et al 2013 d circinale tsao et al 2014 and d lemmermannii kutovaya and watson 2014 and have shown applicability in environmental samples while our method detects potential geosmin producing cyanobacteria in environmental samples this study has not directly demonstrated using direct chemical analysis or rna expression studies the potential of pcr positive samples to produce geosmin however it is worth noting that previous studies giglio et al 2011 su et al 2013 tsao et al 2014 have shown strong correlation between cyanobacterial samples encoding the geosmin synthase gene and geosmin production and therefore this study justifies the use of the newly designed primer pair as an effective tool to monitor potential geosmin producing cyanobacteria furthermore recent studies graham et al 2010 suurnäkki et al 2015 have reported that toxigenic and t o producing cyanobacteria tend to co exist within a bloom this provides scope for incorporating the current short geoa amplicon into an existing multiplex tandem pcr tool developed previously for routine monitoring of toxigenic cyanobacteria baker et al 2013 allowing simultaneous monitoring of cyanotoxins as well as geosmin in a single standardised platform a similar approach may also be developed to identify the major producers of other t o compounds such as mib 5 conclusions we screened 253 environmental bloom samples from different locations in victoria australia using pcr to understand the genetic diversity of geosmin producing cyanobacteria our results indicate that d ucrainicum is an important geosmin contributor in various water resources across victoria our study supported development of a novel small amplicon pcr primer set able to broadly identify all geosmin producing cyanobacteria identified in the current study using a single protocol this newly designed tool may now be explored for development as a quantitative assay and packaged with existing qpcr assays targeting cyanotoxin biosynthetic gene clusters providing a much needed tool for routine monitoring of surface water quality our study further emphasises the necessity to identify sequence yet uncharacterized geosmin producing cyanobacteria and better designing of pcr primers to systematically detect all geoa genes conflict of interest authors declare no conflict of interest authors contributions manuscript written by n j n

six years of monitoring data for 22 metals in the infiltrate from three permeable pavements pa pc and picp are summarized values are contrasted with the corresponding traditional hma surface runoff cc and rainwater rw the objectives are 1 to give characterized metals concentrations in rainwater stormwater surface runoff and infiltrate from different types of permeable pavements in commercial area 2 to use total metal emc values from permeable pavement infiltrates to compare with existing standards gel and mcl to determine the potential impact on groundwater and drinking water supply and 3 to

strategy 2 methods 2 1 site description and sampling methods during 2009 the u s epa constructed a 4000 m2 parking lot at the edison environmental center eec in edison new jersey fig 1 it is used by eec staff and visitors during workdays the parking lot is surfaced with three permeable pavements picp pc and pa from north to south the storage gallery under the parking lot is constructed of american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto no 2 size compacted recycled concrete aggregate rca the pc and pa were placed directly on the compacted rca the picp was placed on a aashto no 8 aggregate bedding course with aashto no 57 aggregate used as a choker above the aashto no 2 each permeable surface has four epdm ethylene propylene diene monomer lined sections numbered 1 4 from west to east the liner is isolates the upper 0 41 m of the storage gallery infiltrating water from each lined section was piped to a 5 7 m3 high density polyethylene hdpe tank for homogenizing and sampling the tanks completely collected rain events as large as 38 mm rainfall exceeding 38 mm bypasses the collection tanks sampling tanks were emptied and cleaned before each event the driving lanes and the southernmost single row were paved with hma the runoff from the southernmost hma section entered the rain gardens through six curb cuts the runoff was sampled at two inlets cc4 and cc5 selected by lot as sampling points at the start of the experiments to serve as a control the parking lot was built on a 1 6 longitudinal slope from north to south and permeable surface area to drainage area ratio is 60 winter maintenance used a rubber edged plow blade and pelletized cacl2 with no added sand applied from a typical truck mounted impeller based spreader the impeller turns at a constant speed so more pellets are applied per unit area as the truck slows leading to uneven distribution from january 2010 to october 2015 samples were collected from infiltrates of the three permeable pavement picp pc pa surface runoff from curb cuts draining from traditional asphalt cc and rainwater rw samples were analyzed for 22 metals in both total and dissolved phases by icp aes epa method 200 7 usepa 1994 the sampling timeline and strategy is presented in fig 2 samples were immediately carried to the on site laboratory after collection sample ph was analyzed at the on site laboratory using an ion specific electrode orion dual star ph ise meter thermo fisher scientific inc beverly ma dissolved samples were first passed through a 0 45 μm polypropylene membrane ghp membrane pall corp port washington ny and all metal samples total and dissolved were acidified ph 2 with hno3 for preservation samples were refrigerated until shipped in coolers with cold packs for overnight delivery to epa s laboratory in cincinnati ohio for analysis the metals list including the number of samples their detection limits dl and the censored percentage for each meal from each source can be found in table s1 in the supplementary information metals in new permeable pavement surface materials were extracted using di water at a weight volume ratio g ml of 1 4 for 24 h to help understand the potential surface material contribution of metal concentrations in permeable pavement infiltrates then the liquid samples were treated and analyzed the same as metal infiltrate samples 2 2 data handling and statistical analyses data in this research are left censored indicating some values are less than the dl substitution maximum likelihood estimation mle and nonparametric methods are three basic methods for analyzing data with non detects substitution is recommended by usepa 2000 when censored data are a small proportion less than 15 of the total population this approach artificially affects both mean and variance estimates and has been shown to give poor results in simulation studies huston and juarez colunga 2009 for this study the robust regression on order statistics ros demonstrated to work well for both small and large data sets helsel 2011 was selected to estimate summary statistics when censored data proportion was less than 80 when the data set contained more than 80 censored data the percentage of uncensored data was reported without the summary descriptive statistics total metal mt and dissolved metal md concentrations were analyzed separately for summary statistics hypothesis comparisons were performed using both parametric and non parametric methods table 1 mle is a parametric method used to compare center differences between two or more independent groups of censored data mle is a large sample method uncensored samples 30 50 based on parametric distributions and sensitive to outliers helsel 2011 wilcoxon rank sum tests are non parametric methods for testing differences between two groups and the wilcoxon score test is a multivariate extension of it for comparisons among multiple groups although non parametric methods are not as powerful as parametric methods at detecting difference they require fewer assumptions about the underlying data distribution and are less sensitive to sample size and outliers huston and juarez colunga 2009 non parametric methods provide a check for its corresponding parametric method although the confidence interval estimate is not available there may be evidence of assumption violations if these two methods provided different results huston and juarez colunga 2009 when comparisons were applied between paired observations the difference between each pair which are interval censored were calculated first and then either the parametric paired mle test or non parametric modified sign test was performed on differences between measurements the dissolved fraction f d is defined as f d c d c t where c d dissolved concentration of a metal element mg l c t total concentration of a metal element mg l since concentrations may be lower than dl in some cases the range of the median f d was reported the exceedance probability plots were created by ranking the measured values from the largest to the smallest and plotted in a semi log scale li and davis 2009 to compare concentrations distribution in different sources box and whisker plots were used to show the shape of the distribution the central value and its variability censored values were modeled by ros method lee 2013 the procedure first computes the weibull type plotting positions of all observations a linear regression was performed using the plotting positions of the uncensored observations and their normal quantiles this model was then used to estimate the concentration of the censored observations as a function of their normal quantiles statistical analysis was performed using r r development core team 2014 with the nada package lee 2013 for computing statistics with non detects a significance level of α 0 05 was set for all statistical comparisons hypotheses tests were applied on stressors with non detectable samples less than 80 3 results 3 1 general statistical analysis result table s1 in the supplementary information lists the summary statistics number of observations n

during the first 1 5 year period the large duplication rate was established to demonstrate adequate homogenization and sampling techniques for the 5 7 m3 tanks the wilcoxon signed rank test for uncensored paired samples and non parametric modified sign test for censored paired samples indicate that only 2 out of 105 21 stressors 5 sources groups of duplicate samples showed significant differences for either filtered or unfiltered samples this demonstrated that the procedures of sample collection storage and analysis were adequate to obtain representative samples and supported the decision in the following period to collect 10 duplicate samples total and dissolved concentrations for each metal were compared pairwise to identify if there was a difference metals with a significant difference between the dissolved and total concentrations indicate at least some of the metal is particulate associated the dissolved fraction is an important indicator of bioavailability

dissolved fraction and the comparison of total and dissolved concentrations are summarized in table s1 in the supplementary information location section was not a significant effect for most metals in surface runoff total concentrations of al fe and v collected from cc4 were statistically less than those collected from cc5 for permeable pavement infiltrates 2 ba cu 6 al ba ca fe mg sr and 5 ca fe k sr v out of 21 metals showed statistical differences by locations in the infiltrates of picp pa and pc respectively section 4 showed statistical difference either larger or smaller more frequently than other sections al ba ca and sr concentrations in section 4 in pa infiltrates were the largest among all four sections whereas cu concentrations in picp as well as ca and sr concentrations in pc section 4 were the smallest among the four sections the reasons for the differences in the infiltrate concentrations from this section are unknown uneven salt application seems unlikely as ba cu k and v which were not detected in the deicing salt were among the significantly different melts metals with statistically significant difference for locations from different sources are shown in table 2 table 3 summarizes the statistical groups among all five sources by kruskal wallis test uncensored data or wilcoxon score test censored data to investigate if there is a treatment difference between permeable pavements and if there is a metal concentration difference after passing through the permeable pavements 3 2 comparing metals with existing standards exceedance probabilities were calculated

in this study an analytical method with a smaller detection limit would be needed to analyze be in future study the remaining twelve metals are grouped by their concentrations compared with established standards and the performance of three permeable pavements and listed in table 4 3 2 1 group i ba cr cu mn ni zn although concentrations differed among permeable pavement infiltrates most metals concentrations in three permeable pavement infiltrates were less than both the gels and mcls cu is taken as an example to show the exceedance probability plots and boxplots style in this group fig 3 there was no significant difference between the total concentrations in rw and cc for ba cr and zn mn cu and ni in cc total concentrations were statistically larger than in rw but all at very low level less than 3 of their gels the increase of cu and mn was mostly based on particulate metals accumulation from impervious area since these two metals were almost totally dissolved in rw whereas f d 50 in cc the dissolved and total metal cr cu ni zn concentrations in cc were either close to or less than the median values for runoff from commercial areas listed in the national stormwater quality database nsqd pitt et al 2004a differences in concentrations with the nsqd can be attributed at least in part to the reduced traffic at the eec compared with the coming and goings at many commercial activates such a convenience store zn concentrations total in all the three permeable pavement infiltrates mn cu and ni concentrations total in pc and pa infiltrates were smaller than in cc metals concentrations total in picp infiltrates were usually the largest among the three permeable pavements with large fraction particulate bounded take mn concentration in picp infiltrate as an example the m n d was less than 0 001 mg l whereas m n t 0 062 mg l this can be mainly attribute to the particulate metals which were filtered from the runoff in the pc and pa but carried into the picp infiltrates however ba is an exception ba concentrations in pa infiltrate b a t 0 022 mg l was larger than in picp infiltrate b a t 0 011 mg l which is due to the large fraction of dissolved part in pa b a d 0 021 mg l f d 85 3 2 2 group ii as cd pb sb nearly 60 99 metal concentrations in permeable pavement infiltrates are less than gels and mcls no statistically measureable difference was found among the five sources for metals in this group suggesting permeable pavements in this study had no effect on metals in this group as fig 4 the concentration of many samples in this group were non detectable more than half of as cd and sb samples and 40 of pb samples were less than dls pb p b t 0 004 mg l p b d 0 003 mg l and cd c d t 0 0003 mg l c d d 0 0003 mg l concentrations in cc

attributable to the continued steady decline in runoff lead concentrations since the elimination of leaded gasoline both the nsqd median as concentration values in surface runoff 0 0024 mg l and the median cc value in edison parking lot 0 004 mg l were less than as dl 0 004 mg l more than 80 cd and pb samples were smaller than criteria however around 40 of as and 30 of sb were larger than the mcls 3 2 3 group iii al fe al and fe are primary soil sediment constituents approximately eight percent and five percent of lithosphere is al and fe respectively lindsay 1979 they can both cause detrimental effects in receiving waters in their dissolved forms more than 90 of the al and fe fig 5 concentrations in pa and pc infiltrates were less than the gels however only 50 of al and 7 of fe concentrations met the standards in picp infiltrates the median value of al and fe were both almost one order of magnitude larger in surface runoff than rainwater cc rw there was picp a l t 2 009 mg l pa a l t 1 291 mg l cc a l t 0 348 mg l pc a l t 0 181 mg l f d in picp and pa are 4 and 94 respectively suggesting that al in pa infiltrates is mainly dissolved and in picp infiltrates is mainly particulate bound an increase in ph substantially increases the abundance of dissolved al p h p i c p 9 p h p c 9 3 p h p a 11 1 al is an amphoteric metal which is more soluble at higher al oh 4 and lower ph al3 and reaches minimum solubility at a specific ph around 6 5 this also happens for other metals such as zn cu and ni but not the same as the common finding that metals become soluble and mobile at lower ph mikkelsen et al 1994 sparks 2003 based on the median f d values fe is found mainly particulate bound in all five sources which is in accordance with solubility diagram for iron that ferric hydroxide fe2o3 3h2o is the most common species in the ph range of 5 11 and eh range of 0 4 0 6 v compared with the cc f e t 0 309 mg l fe concentrations in picp f e t 3 720 mg l were dramatically larger whereas in pa f e t 0 063 mg l and pc f e t 0 125 mg l were smaller 3 3 metals associated with deicing chemicals road salt was the only material intentionally introduced to the system na mg and ca are metals predominantly associated with road salt as a deicing chemical the concentration of these metals was larger in the surface runoff than rainwater cc rw due to the deicing salts application during snow season na fig 6 concentrations in the three permeable pavement infiltrates pc n a t 131 8 mg l pcip n a t 99 6 mg l pa n a t 81 5 mg l were statistically larger than in cc samples n a t 3 5 mg l and rw n a t 0 6 mg l surface material leaching tests showed na concentrations from pc n a t 107 1 mg l were larger than from pa n a t 28 4 mg l and picp n a t 8 1 mg l this suggests that part of the na in the infiltrate may be leaching directly from the materials of construction although results from surface material test are only used for qualitative comparison due to the large variation in results they may explain the large na concentration in pc infiltrates ca fig 7 concentrations were found pa c a t 34 29 mg l picp c a t 7 20 mg l pc c a t 5 42 mg l cc c a t 4 61 mg l rw c a t 0 46 mg l whereas ca concentrations in pa were c a t 7 52 mg l much less than picp c a t 20 90 mg l and pc c a t 18 38 mg l in surface material test the infiltration test reported pc 4000 cm h picp 2400 cm h pa 200 cm h borst 2010 the smallest infiltration rate in pa resulted in larger concentrations of dissolved ca in pa c a d 31 59 mg l compared to picp c a d 4 64 mg l and pc c a d 4 73 mg l the same results was found in chloride cl by borst and brown 2014 the ca like the cl is released slowly from pa and persisted at larger concentrations compared to picp and pc during no snow season this may explain the largest median total ca concentration in pa infiltrates during the entire study mg fig 8 had picp m g t 4 59 mg l pc m g t 0 49 mg l cc m g t 0 51 mg l pa m g t 0 11 mg l rw m g t 0 12 mg l pa can effectively remove mg mg concentrations in picp infiltrates were an order larger than the other two permeable pavement infiltrates for all three metals in this group a prominent jump was found in exceedance probability plots figs 6 8 for dissolved metal concentrations at 10 samples in picp and pc infiltrates which may indicate the deicing salts application 3 4 other metals this research monitored k li si sn sr and v which are rarely mentioned by current research sn concentrations were small and no statistical differences were found among the five sources k li si sr and v in all permeable pavement infiltrates were statistically larger than in cc and rw moreover k si sr and v accumulated on the surface and runoff concentrations were larger than rainwater cc rw k and v were not detected in deicing salts k is an essential element for human animal and plant tissues adverse health effects due to k consumption from drinking water are unlikely to occur in healthy individuals there was pc k t 26 7 mg l pa k t 13 5 mg l picp k t 7 5 mg l surface material test shows that k concentrations in pc k t 176 0 mg l were much larger than in pa k t 0 3 mg l and picp k t 33 0 mg l moreover a prominent jump at 10 in samples for dissolved metals in picp and pc infiltrates was found for k as well extensive cation exchange during snow season may be a possible explanation of it v concentrations pc v t 0 024 mg l picp v t 0 021 mg l pa v t 0 011 mg l in permeable pavement infiltrates were in the range of v concentrations in drinking water of 0 0002 mg l to more than 0 1 mg l vouk 1979 si sr and li were found in both deicers and surface material leachate si is the second most abundant element in the earth s crust the median values of si concentrations in permeable pavement infiltrates ranged from 6 5 to 10 5 mg l mcneely et al 1979 reported that silicon commonly ranges of 1 30 mg l in natural waters in canada sr concentration in pa infiltrates was s r t 1 007 mg l with the f d 92 it is one order of magnitude larger than in picp s r t 0 020 mg l and pc s r t 0 019 mg l no water quality criteria is set for sr however the toxicity of sr is believed very minimal usepa 2007 the median value of li concentrations in permeable pavement infiltrates is from 0 016 to 0 020 mg l which is much smaller than the maximum recommended concentration of li in irrigation water of 2 5 mg l environmental studies borad 1972 4 conclusions and discussion several metals were detected as statistically different by locations section in both surface runoff and permeable pavement infiltrates unevenly spread of deicing salts for winter application and preferred vehicle parking pattern may both be the reasons of metal concentrations different among sections deicing salts applied in snow season were not evenly spread which may be one of the reasons for al ca fe mg and sr concentration differences among sections however ba cu k and v which were not detected in the deicing salt also showed the concentration differences among sections metal release in the parking lots might also be effected by the vehicle parking pattern preferential parking near the doors of the adjacent building has been observed by brown and borst 2015 and moreover some vehicles are likely to park in the east part of parking lot section 4 the dissolved and total metal cr cu ni zn as cd pb concentrations in surface runoff were within one order magnitude of the median values in the nsqd indicating its representative of national surface runoff for this study eleven metals were detected in surface runoff at larger concentrations than the rainwater these metals include mn cu al fe ca mg na k si sr and v with cu the only priority metal pollutants in the usepa list usepa 2012 studied in this research the larger relative concentration indicates surface accumulation between rain events thirteen metals in this study have existing standards such as gels or mcls be was identified in less than 10 of the samples at concentrations larger than the laboratory reported detection limit the dl in this study 0 005 mg l was larger than mcl 0 004 mg l ba cr mn cu ni and zn concentrations in permeable pavement infiltrates were uniformly less than the gels and mcls the concentrations of as cd pb and sb in permeable pavement infiltrates exceeded the gels and mcls for 1 40 more than 90 of al and fe samples in pa and pc infiltrates are less than gels however 50 of al and 93 of fe samples in picp infiltrates exceeded the gels as cd pb sb and sn samples did not vary by surfaces this may be 1 because these metals passed through the systems without reaction 2 or because permeable pavements act as filters for particulate bound metals sansalone 1999 and could trap dissolved heavy metals to their fixed media dierkes et al 2000 and then keep a steady state adsorption and desorption some metal concentrations total in permeable pavement infiltrates were larger than hma runoff picp ba cr mn cu al fe ca mg na k li si sr v pa ba cr al ca na k li si sr v pc cr na k li si sr v this may be attributes to 1 surface material of permeable pavement leaching 2 spatial variability in deicing salt application and the influence of previous events borst and brown 2014 and 3 na and k may exchange for ca and mg in underlying aggregates which promotes leaching or mobilization of heavy metals granato et al 1995 marsalek et al 2003 cu mn ni al fe mg concentrations in picp infiltrates were much larger than the other two permeable pavement infiltrates most of which are mainly particulate bounded this may be because suspended solids or salt particles trapped in the gap between picp and underlying aggregate were directly flushed into the collection tank pa had the slowest release rate and persisted at larger dissolved ca concentrations than picp and pc which is in accordance with the conclusion found for chloride borst and brown 2014 this theory may also explain the relatively larger concentration of ba and sr in pa infiltrates pc infiltrates had the largest metal concentrations of na k and v which may contribute to the surface material leaching

pavers picp pervious concrete pc and porous asphalt pa samples of each permeable pavement infiltrate surface runoff from traditional asphalt and rainwater were analyzed in duplicate for 22 metals total and dissolved for 6 years in more than 99 of the samples the concentration of barium chromium copper manganese nickel and zinc and in 60 90 of the samples the concentration of arsenic cadmium lead and antimony in infiltrates from all three permeable pavements met both the groundwater effluent limitations gel and maximum contaminant levels mcl the concentration of aluminum 50 and iron 93 in picp infiltrates samples exceed the gels however the concentration in more than 90 samples pa and pc infiltrates met the gels no measurable difference in metal concentrations was found from the five sources for arsenic cadmium lead antimony and tin large concentrations of eleven metals including manganese copper aluminum iron calcium magnesium sodium potassium silica strontium and vanadium were detected in surface runoff than the rainwater chromium copper manganese nickel aluminum zinc iron and magnesium concentrations in picp infiltrates calcium barium and strontium concentrations in pa infiltrates sodium potassium and vanadium concentrations in pc infiltrates were statistically larger than the other two permeable pavement infiltrates graphical abstract image 1 keywords stormwater permeable pavements metals water quality 1 introduction during urbanization traditionally undeveloped lands became impervious this change dramatically reduces rainfall pathways for storage

sometimes includes geotextiles and underdrains drake et al 2014 during a storm event stormwater first infiltrates into an underground storage area and then is either conveyed by perforated pipes or exfiltrates to the surrounding soil and ultimately recharges in the groundwater brattebo and booth 2003 sansalone and buchberger 1995 permeable pavements are considered a good alternative for urban stormwater drainage management because they provide water quality treatment and they restore the predevelopment hydrology bean et al 2007 borst and brown 2014 sansalone et al 2008 possible pollutant

the existing underlying soil metals in the infiltrating water interact with vadose zone soils but some metals from the permeable pavement systems may reach the groundwater that serve as a source of

deicing salts legret and colandini 1999 studied the effects of a porous pavement with reservoir structure on runoff water quality of heavy metals pb cu cd and zn in france and found that metal concentrations were reduced by the passage through the porous pavement berbee et al 1999 reported that runoff from well maintained pa contains a relatively small concentration of heavy metals than traditional hma in the research conducted in netherlands in the rushton 2001 research study at the florida aquarium in tampa fl metal load reductions of cu fe pb and mn were all more than 75 after passing through porous paving with a swale brattebo and booth 2003 did six years of research in renton wa on four different types of permeable pavements and found that cu and zn concentrations are significantly lower in infiltrate water from permeable pavements than in runoff from adjacent asphalt lot picp was monitored in waterford ct and concentrations of cu pb and zn were significantly less than runoff from asphalt driveways gilbert and clausen 2006 in a field research in auckland new zealand the event mean concentrations of zinc and copper in discharge from a permeable modular concrete paver were statistically less than that from the reference conventional asphalt fassman and blackbourn 2011 drake et al 2014 compared the winter quality of stormwater outflows from three permeable pavement systems one pc and two picp with runoff from an asphalt control pavement and found that the permeable pavement systems performed similarly in reducing the event mean concentrations emc and total pollutant loadings for cu fe mn and zn in recent research novel techniques such as carbon negative aggregate or high sulfur and high carbon fly ashes were used to retrofit the traditional

application nearby in the twin cities metropolitan area of minnesota over 46 months and found na and cl concentrations were 10 25 times lager in these lakes than in other non urban lakes in this paper six years of monitoring data for 22 metals in the infiltrate from three permeable pavements pa pc and picp are summarized values are contrasted with the corresponding traditional hma surface runoff cc and rainwater rw the objectives are 1 to give characterized metals concentrations in rainwater stormwater surface runoff and infiltrate from different types of permeable pavements in commercial area 2 to use total metal emc values from permeable pavement infiltrates to compare with existing standards gel and mcl to determine the potential impact on groundwater and drinking water supply and 3 to compare metal concentrations in infiltrates among three permeable pavements as well as in surface runoff and rainwater to identify if the permeable pavements is a promising stormwater management strategy 2 methods 2 1 site description and sampling methods during 2009 the u s epa constructed a 4000 m2 parking lot at the edison environmental center eec in edison new jersey fig 1 it is used by eec staff and visitors during workdays the parking lot is surfaced with three permeable pavements picp pc and pa from north to south the storage gallery under the parking lot is constructed of american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto no 2 size compacted recycled concrete aggregate rca the pc and pa were placed directly on the compacted rca the picp was placed on a aashto no 8 aggregate bedding course with aashto no 57 aggregate used as a choker above the aashto no 2 each permeable surface has four epdm ethylene propylene diene monomer lined sections numbered 1 4 from west to east the liner is isolates the upper 0 41 m of the storage gallery infiltrating water from each lined section was piped to a 5 7 m3 high density polyethylene hdpe tank for homogenizing and sampling the tanks completely collected rain events as large as 38 mm rainfall exceeding 38 mm bypasses the collection tanks sampling tanks were emptied and cleaned before each event the driving lanes and the southernmost single row were paved with hma the runoff from the southernmost hma section entered the rain gardens through six curb cuts the runoff was sampled at two inlets cc4 and cc5 selected by lot as sampling points at the start of the experiments to serve as a control the parking lot was built on a 1 6 longitudinal slope from north to south and permeable surface area to drainage area ratio is 60 winter maintenance used a rubber edged plow blade and pelletized cacl2 with no added sand applied from a typical truck mounted impeller based spreader the impeller turns at a constant speed so more pellets are applied per unit area as the truck slows leading to uneven distribution from january 2010 to october 2015 samples were collected from infiltrates of the three permeable pavement picp pc pa surface runoff from curb cuts draining from traditional asphalt cc and rainwater rw samples were analyzed for 22 metals in both total and dissolved phases by icp aes epa method 200 7 usepa 1994 the sampling timeline and strategy is presented in fig 2 samples were immediately carried to the on site laboratory after collection sample ph was analyzed at the on site laboratory using an ion specific electrode orion dual star ph ise meter thermo fisher scientific inc beverly ma dissolved samples were first passed through a 0 45 μm polypropylene membrane ghp membrane pall corp port washington ny and all metal samples total and dissolved were acidified ph 2 with hno3 for preservation samples were refrigerated until shipped in coolers with cold packs for overnight delivery to epa s laboratory in cincinnati ohio for analysis the metals list including the number of samples their detection limits dl and the censored percentage for each meal from each source can be found in table s1 in the supplementary information metals in new permeable pavement surface materials were extracted using di water at a weight volume ratio g ml of 1 4 for 24 h to help understand the potential surface material contribution of metal concentrations in permeable pavement infiltrates then the liquid samples were treated and analyzed the same as metal infiltrate samples 2 2 data handling and statistical analyses data in this research are left censored indicating some values are less than the dl substitution maximum likelihood estimation mle and nonparametric methods are three basic methods for analyzing data with non detects substitution is recommended by usepa 2000 when censored data are a small proportion less than 15 of the total population this approach artificially affects both mean and variance estimates and has been shown to give poor results in simulation studies huston and juarez colunga 2009 for this study the robust regression on order statistics ros demonstrated to work well for both small and large data sets helsel 2011 was selected to estimate summary statistics when censored data proportion was less than 80 when the data set contained more than 80 censored data the percentage of uncensored data was reported without the summary descriptive statistics total metal mt and dissolved metal md concentrations were analyzed separately for summary statistics hypothesis comparisons were performed using both parametric and non parametric methods table 1 mle is a parametric method used to compare center differences between two or more independent groups of censored data mle is a large sample method uncensored samples 30 50 based on parametric distributions and sensitive to outliers helsel 2011 wilcoxon rank sum tests are non parametric methods for testing differences between two groups and the wilcoxon score test is a multivariate extension of it for comparisons among multiple groups although non parametric methods are not as powerful as parametric methods at detecting difference they require fewer assumptions about the underlying data distribution and are less sensitive to sample size and outliers huston and juarez colunga 2009 non parametric methods provide a check for its corresponding parametric method although the confidence interval estimate is not available there may be evidence of assumption violations if these two methods provided different results huston and juarez colunga 2009 when comparisons were applied between paired observations the difference between each pair which are interval censored were calculated first and then either the parametric paired mle test or non parametric modified sign test was performed on differences between measurements the dissolved fraction f d is defined as f d c d c t where c d dissolved concentration of a metal element mg l c t total concentration of a metal element mg l since concentrations may be lower than dl in some cases the range of the median f d was reported the exceedance probability plots were created by ranking the measured values from the largest to the smallest and plotted in a semi log scale li and davis 2009 to compare concentrations distribution in different sources box and whisker plots were used to show the shape of the distribution the central value and its variability censored values were modeled by ros method lee 2013 the procedure first computes the weibull type plotting positions of all observations a linear regression was performed using the plotting positions of the uncensored observations and their normal quantiles this model was then used to estimate the concentration of the censored observations as a function of their normal quantiles statistical analysis was performed using r r development core team 2014 with the nada package lee 2013 for computing statistics with non detects a significance level of α 0 05 was set for all statistical comparisons hypotheses tests were applied on stressors with non detectable samples less than 80 3 results 3 1 general statistical analysis result table s1 in the supplementary information lists the summary statistics number of observations n percentage of censored observations dl median m mean m standard deviation sd calculated for all 22 metals in both total and dissolved phases other than beryllium be all metals have censored percentages less than 80 no summary statistics or statistical comparison were applied on be results will be discussed later by metal groups as shown in fig 2 and 100 duplicate samples were collected during the first 1 5 year period the large duplication rate was established to demonstrate adequate homogenization and sampling techniques for the 5 7 m3 tanks the wilcoxon signed rank test for uncensored paired samples and non parametric modified sign test for censored paired samples indicate that only 2 out of 105 21 stressors 5 sources groups of duplicate samples showed significant differences for either filtered or unfiltered samples this demonstrated that the procedures of sample collection storage and analysis were adequate to obtain representative samples and supported the decision in the following period to collect 10 duplicate samples total and dissolved concentrations for each metal were compared pairwise to identify if there was a difference metals with a significant difference between the dissolved and total concentrations indicate at least some of the metal is particulate associated the dissolved fraction is an important indicator of bioavailability and an implication for metal transport and immobilization which were used by epa to set and measure compliance with water quality standards cfr 1995 sansalone and buchberger 1997a the range of median dissolved fraction and the comparison of total and dissolved concentrations are summarized in table s1 in the supplementary information location section was not a significant effect for most metals in surface runoff total concentrations of al fe and v collected from cc4 were statistically less than those collected from cc5 for permeable pavement infiltrates 2 ba cu 6 al ba ca fe mg sr and 5 ca fe k

than other sections al ba ca and sr concentrations in section 4 in pa infiltrates were the largest among all four sections whereas cu concentrations in picp as well as ca and sr concentrations in pc section 4 were the smallest among the four sections the reasons for the differences in the infiltrate concentrations from this section are unknown uneven salt application seems unlikely as ba cu k and v which were not detected in the deicing salt were among the significantly different melts metals with statistically significant difference for locations from different sources are shown in table 2 table 3 summarizes the statistical groups among all five sources by kruskal wallis test uncensored data or wilcoxon score test censored data to investigate if there is a treatment difference between permeable pavements and if there is a metal concentration difference after passing through the permeable pavements 3 2 comparing metals with existing standards exceedance probabilities were calculated for metals total with criterion of gels and mcls in five sources pa pc picp cc rw table s1 in the supplementary information there are both gels and mcls for ba cr cu as cd pb and sb only gels for be mn ni zn al and fe other than cu the mcls are smaller than gels the exceedance probability plots and boxplots for selected metals are presented in fig 3 to fig 8 plots for other metals can be found in the supplementary information fig s1 fig s16 in exceedance probability plots solid symbols indicate ranked values above the dl open symbols are values modeled by ros be a priority metal pollutant usepa 2012 was detected in less than 10 of the analyses from any source for either the total or the dissolved concentration the mcl for be is 0 004 mg l usepa 2009 which is less than the 0 005 mg l dl in this study an analytical method with a smaller detection limit would be needed to analyze be in future study the remaining twelve metals are grouped by their concentrations compared with established standards and the performance of three permeable pavements and listed in table 4 3 2 1 group i ba cr cu mn ni zn although concentrations differed among permeable pavement infiltrates most metals concentrations in three permeable pavement infiltrates were less than both the gels and mcls cu is taken as an example to show the exceedance probability plots and boxplots style in this group fig 3 there was no significant difference between the total concentrations in rw and cc for ba cr and zn mn cu and ni in cc total concentrations were statistically larger than in rw but all at very low level less than 3 of their gels the increase of cu and mn was mostly based on particulate metals accumulation from impervious area since these two metals were almost totally dissolved in rw whereas f d 50 in cc the dissolved and total metal cr cu ni zn concentrations in cc were either close to or less than the median values for runoff from commercial areas listed in the national stormwater quality database nsqd pitt et al 2004a differences in concentrations with the nsqd can be attributed at least in part to the reduced traffic at the eec compared with the coming and goings at many commercial activates such a convenience store zn concentrations total in all the three permeable pavement infiltrates mn cu and ni concentrations total in pc and pa infiltrates were smaller than in cc metals concentrations total in picp infiltrates were usually the largest among the three permeable pavements with large fraction particulate bounded take mn concentration in picp infiltrate as an example the m n d was less than 0 001 mg l whereas m n t 0 062 mg l this can be mainly attribute to the particulate metals which were filtered from the runoff in the pc and pa but carried into the picp infiltrates however ba is an exception ba concentrations in pa infiltrate b a t 0 022 mg l was larger than in picp infiltrate b a t 0 011 mg l which is due to the large fraction of dissolved part in pa b a d 0 021 mg l f d 85 3 2 2 group ii as cd pb sb nearly 60 99 metal concentrations in permeable pavement infiltrates are less than gels and mcls no statistically measureable difference was found among the five sources for metals in this group suggesting permeable pavements in this study had no effect on metals in this group as fig 4 the concentration of many samples in this group were non detectable more than half of as cd and sb samples and 40 of pb samples were less than dls pb p b t 0 004 mg l p b d 0 003 mg l and cd c d t 0 0003 mg l c d d 0 0003 mg l concentrations in cc

attributable to the continued steady decline in runoff lead concentrations since the elimination of leaded gasoline both the nsqd median as concentration values in surface runoff 0 0024 mg l and the median cc value in edison parking lot 0 004 mg l were less than as dl 0 004 mg l more than 80 cd and pb samples were smaller than criteria however around 40 of as and 30 of sb were larger than the mcls 3 2 3 group iii al fe al and fe are primary soil sediment constituents approximately eight percent and five percent of lithosphere is al and fe respectively lindsay 1979 they can both cause detrimental effects in receiving waters in their dissolved forms more than 90 of the al and fe fig 5 concentrations in pa and pc infiltrates were less than the gels however only 50 of al and 7 of fe concentrations met the standards in picp infiltrates the median value of al and fe were both almost one order of magnitude larger in surface runoff than rainwater cc rw there was picp a l t 2 009 mg l pa a l t 1 291 mg l cc a l t 0 348 mg l pc a l t 0 181 mg l f d in picp and pa are 4 and 94 respectively suggesting that al in pa infiltrates is mainly dissolved and in picp infiltrates is mainly particulate bound an increase in ph substantially increases the abundance of dissolved al p h p i c p 9 p h p c 9 3 p h p a 11 1 al is an amphoteric metal which is more soluble at higher al oh 4 and lower ph al3 and reaches minimum solubility at a specific ph around 6 5 this also happens for other metals such as zn cu and ni but not the same as the common finding that metals become soluble and mobile at lower ph mikkelsen et al 1994 sparks 2003 based on the median f d values fe is found mainly particulate bound in all five sources which is in accordance with solubility diagram for iron that ferric hydroxide fe2o3 3h2o is the most common species in the ph range of 5 11 and eh range of 0 4 0 6 v compared with the cc f e t 0 309 mg l fe concentrations in picp f e t 3 720 mg l were dramatically larger whereas in pa f e t 0 063 mg l and pc f e t 0 125 mg l were smaller 3 3 metals associated with deicing chemicals road salt was the only material intentionally introduced to the system na mg and ca are metals predominantly associated with road salt as a deicing chemical the concentration of these metals was larger in the surface runoff than rainwater cc rw due to the deicing salts application during snow season na fig 6 concentrations in the three permeable pavement infiltrates pc n a t 131 8 mg l pcip n a t 99 6 mg l pa n a t 81 5 mg l were statistically larger than in cc samples n a t 3 5 mg l and rw n a t 0 6 mg l surface material leaching tests showed na concentrations from pc n a t 107 1 mg l were larger than from pa n a t 28 4 mg l and picp n a t 8 1 mg l this suggests that part of the na in the infiltrate may be leaching directly from the materials of construction although results from surface material test are only used for qualitative comparison due to the large variation in results they may explain the large na concentration in pc infiltrates ca fig 7 concentrations were found pa c a t 34 29 mg l picp c a t 7 20 mg l pc c a t 5 42 mg l cc c a t 4 61 mg l rw c a t 0 46 mg l whereas ca concentrations in pa were c a t 7 52 mg l much less than picp c a t 20 90 mg l and pc c a t 18 38 mg l in surface material test the infiltration test reported pc 4000 cm h picp 2400 cm h pa 200 cm h borst 2010 the smallest infiltration rate in pa resulted in larger concentrations of dissolved ca in pa c a d 31 59 mg l compared to picp c a d 4 64 mg l and pc c a d 4 73 mg l the same results was found in chloride cl by borst and brown 2014 the ca like the cl is released slowly from pa and persisted at larger concentrations compared to picp and pc during no snow season this may explain the largest median total ca concentration in pa infiltrates during the entire study mg fig 8 had picp m g t 4 59 mg l pc m g t 0 49 mg l cc m g t 0 51 mg l pa m g t 0 11 mg l rw m g t 0 12 mg l pa can effectively remove mg mg concentrations in picp infiltrates were an order larger than the other two permeable pavement infiltrates for all three metals in this group a prominent jump was found in exceedance probability plots figs 6 8 for dissolved metal concentrations at 10 samples in picp and pc infiltrates which may indicate the deicing salts application 3 4 other metals this research monitored k li si sn sr and v which are rarely mentioned by current research sn concentrations were small and no statistical differences were found among the five sources k li si sr and v in all permeable pavement infiltrates were statistically larger than in cc and rw moreover k si sr and v accumulated on the surface and runoff concentrations were larger than rainwater cc rw k and v were not detected in deicing salts k is an essential element for human animal and plant tissues adverse health effects due to k consumption from drinking water are unlikely to occur in healthy individuals there was pc k t 26 7 mg l pa k t 13 5 mg l picp k t 7 5 mg l surface material test shows that k concentrations in pc k t 176 0 mg l were much larger than in pa k t 0 3 mg l and picp k t 33 0 mg l moreover a prominent jump at 10 in samples for dissolved metals in picp and pc infiltrates was found for k as well extensive cation exchange during snow season may be a possible explanation of it v concentrations pc v t 0 024 mg l picp v t 0 021 mg l pa v t 0 011 mg l in permeable pavement infiltrates were in the range of v concentrations in drinking water of 0 0002 mg l to more than 0 1 mg l vouk 1979 si sr and li were found in both deicers and surface material leachate si is the second most abundant element in the earth s crust the median values of si concentrations in permeable pavement infiltrates ranged from 6 5 to 10 5 mg l mcneely et al 1979 reported that silicon commonly ranges of 1 30 mg l in natural waters in canada sr concentration in pa infiltrates was s r t 1 007 mg l with the f d 92 it is one order of magnitude larger than in picp s r t 0 020 mg l and pc s r t 0 019 mg l no water quality criteria is set for sr however the toxicity of sr is believed very minimal usepa 2007 the median value of li concentrations in permeable pavement infiltrates is from 0 016 to 0 020 mg l which is much smaller than the maximum recommended concentration of li in irrigation water of 2 5 mg l environmental studies borad 1972 4 conclusions and discussion several metals were detected as statistically different by locations section in both surface runoff and permeable pavement infiltrates unevenly spread of deicing salts for winter application and preferred vehicle parking pattern may both be the reasons of metal concentrations different among sections deicing salts applied in snow season were not evenly spread which may be one of the reasons for al ca fe mg and sr concentration differences among sections however ba cu k and v which were not detected in the deicing salt also showed the concentration differences among sections metal release in the parking lots might also be effected by the vehicle parking pattern preferential parking near the doors of the adjacent building has been observed by brown and borst 2015 and moreover some vehicles are likely to park in the east part of parking lot section 4 the dissolved and total metal cr cu ni zn as cd pb concentrations in surface runoff were within one order magnitude of the median values in the nsqd indicating its representative of national surface runoff for this study eleven metals were detected in surface runoff at larger concentrations than the rainwater these metals include mn cu al fe ca mg na k si sr and v with cu the only priority metal pollutants in the usepa list usepa 2012 studied in this research the larger relative concentration indicates surface accumulation between rain events thirteen metals in this study have existing standards such as gels or mcls be was identified in less than 10 of the samples at concentrations larger than the laboratory reported detection limit the dl in this study 0 005 mg l was larger than mcl 0 004 mg l ba cr mn cu ni and zn concentrations in permeable pavement infiltrates were uniformly less than the gels and mcls the concentrations of as cd pb and sb in permeable pavement infiltrates exceeded the gels and mcls for 1 40 more than 90 of al and fe samples in pa and pc infiltrates are less than gels however 50 of al and 93 of fe samples in picp infiltrates exceeded the gels as cd pb sb and sn samples did not vary by surfaces this may be 1 because these metals passed through the systems without reaction 2 or because permeable pavements act as filters for particulate bound metals sansalone 1999 and could trap dissolved heavy metals to their fixed media dierkes et al 2000 and then keep a steady state adsorption and desorption some metal concentrations total in permeable pavement infiltrates were larger than hma runoff picp ba cr mn cu al fe ca mg na k li si sr v pa ba cr al ca na k li si sr v pc cr na k li si sr v this may be attributes to 1 surface material of permeable pavement leaching 2 spatial variability in deicing salt application and the influence of previous events borst and brown 2014 and 3 na and k may exchange for ca and mg in underlying aggregates which promotes leaching or mobilization of heavy metals granato et al 1995 marsalek et al 2003 cu mn ni al fe mg concentrations in picp infiltrates were much larger than the other two permeable pavement infiltrates most of which are mainly particulate bounded this may be because suspended solids or salt particles trapped in the gap between picp and underlying aggregate were directly flushed into the collection tank pa had the slowest release rate and persisted at larger dissolved ca concentrations than picp and pc which is in accordance with the conclusion found for chloride borst and brown 2014 this theory may also explain the relatively larger concentration of ba and sr in pa infiltrates pc infiltrates had the largest metal concentrations of na k and v which may contribute to the surface material leaching

19647,packing nano mediators into anaerobic system is an attractive technology to strengthen refractory pollutant removal and methane production from wastewater but is limited by the drawbacks such as easy loss and poor mass transfer in this study gac nzvi mediator was added into egsb reactor to investigate the enhancement effects and mechanism for anaerobic digestion of tetracycline wastewater and its impacts on microbial community structure the results indicated that gac nzvi could enhance cod and toc removal by 12 1 and 10 3 while have no evident influence on tetracycline removal and sulfide production the biogas production and methane content were increased by 21 2 and 26 9 respectively gac nzvi addition resulted in formation of densely packed aggregates and evidently increased the electrical conductivity and eps content in sludge fe content in sludge was 20 43 with the loss of only 5 4 during 34 d operation microbial community analysis revealed that gac nzvi addition could both increase the chao 1 richness index and shannon diversity index of bacteria and archaea it was notable that total methanogens contents increased from 74 7 to 81 74 at genera level resulting in higher methane production while treponema increase might promote the degradation of tetracycline and its metabolite leading to higher cod removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion tetracycline wastewater strengthening gac nzvi mediator methane production 1 introduction tetracycline tc as the cheapest antibiotics with a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity had been widely used in many areas such as human and veterinary medicine zhang et al 2014 tc production wastewater contained high contents of residual antibiotics and by products with the higher cod 15000 mg l ammonium 300 mg l and sulfate 2000 mg l levels and treated effluent was considered as the important source of antibiotic pollution in environment li et al 2004 2008a the tetracycline residue in mother liquor was reported in extremely high levels 844 1077 mg l while that in wastewater treatment plants ranged from several to dozens of mg l even after dilution li et al 2008b due to lower sludge handling costs higher energy efficiency and lower chemical usage comparing with aerobic treatment anaerobic digestion had been normally used for high concentration antibiotic wastewater and sludge treatment as well as biogas production latif et al 2011 however presence of high concentration tc and its biodegradation intermediates in wastewater could disturb the stability of anaerobic biological treatment due to their strong bacteriostatic action which would decrease the treatment efficiency and inhibit biogas production deng et al 2012 the best ways to ensure high efficiency treatment of tc wastewater was to destroy the antibacterial activity of tc and strength the microorganism activity various advanced oxidation process aops such as photocatalytic degradation electro coagulation ultrasonic induced processes uv h2o2 h2o2 o3 fenton electro fenton and photo fenton showed a good performance for tc removal and transformation from the aqueous environment chen et al 2017 jorfi et al 2016 liu et al 2016 yang et al 2016 however high coexisting organic matters in tc production wastewater interfered with tc removal and greatly increased the operation costs which limited aops application in tc wastewater treatment anaerobic biological treatment was a feasible selection for high efficient and low costs treatment of tc wastewater introducing conductive mediator materials into anaerobic digester could help to reinforce the syntrophic actions between bacteria and methanogens and therefore to enhance the metabolic activity for pollutants and the digester s effectiveness zhao et al 2015 carbon based and iron based materials were the commonly used conductive mediators to improve the performance and microbial activity in anaerobic process previous studies reported that conductive carbon materials including biochar granular activated carbon gac carbon cloth and carbon nanotubes could strengthen ethanol transfer to methane via direct interspecies electron transfer diet between special species such as geobacter metallireducens and methanosarcina barkeri or mixture culture in methanogenic sludge chen et al 2014a 2014b li et al 2015 liu et al 2012 luo et al 2015 injection of conductive carbon materials into continuous flow reactors were also found to enhance the transformation of acetate ethanol to methane and the loading rates without failed operation and the mediators might help to degrade the complex organic matters lee et al 2016 xu et al 2015 as a reducing agent zero valent iron zvi could help to create an anaerobic environment which might improve the performance of anaerobic process and alter the community structure of dominant bacteria in anaerobic digesters feng et al 2014 yang et al 2013 zvi addition in bioreactor could provide a more favorable environment for anaerobic microbes by rapidly lowering the oxidation reduction potential orp and buffering acid while h2 produced by iron corrosion could serve as electron donor for hydrogen consuming microorganisms such as methanogenic archaea and denitrifying bacteria son et al 2006 zhang et al 2011c recently zvi packed anaerobic reactor were developed to enhance treatment efficiency of sulfate wastewater azo dye decolorization and sludge digestion resulting in higher cod removal methane production and sulfate reduction feng et al 2014 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2011a other iron materials such as magnetite iron oxide nanoparticles and iron shavings were also used to enhance microbiological activity and methane production in anaerobic condition ambuchi et al 2017 ou et al 2016 however previous studies almost all used the single mediator and the promotion removal efficiency and mechanisms for refractory pollution were not very clear whether the composite mediators had promotion effects for anaerobic digestion process and the relation of microbial community and mediators were also needed further investigation the objectives of the present study were to 1 investigate whether the composite conductive mediators could enhance the conversion of antibiotics and methane production in anaerobic digesters 2 clarify the strengthening mechanisms of mediators on the metabolism of anaerobic microbes in egsb and 3 resolve the relation of mediator and microbial community structure 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor design and operation experiments were conducted in a lab scale egsb reactor with an effective volume of 4 l internal diameter of 8 0 cm height of 120 cm and an overall volume of 7 5 l the reactor was made with strong plexiglass and temperature was controlled at 35 1 c with a thermostat heating system to improve mixing effluent was partially pumped back to the inlet and the up flow velocity was constant at 0 7 m h by controlling the recirculation ratio of 20 1 the hrt of egsb was set as 24 h with the organic loading rate of 5 06 kg cod m3 d biogas and solids were separated from the liquid phase with a gas liquid solids separator at the top of column ph and orp probes were equipped in reactor to real timely measure the ph value and orp after stabilized operating for 51 d gac 1 2 mm tianjin benchmark instrument co ltd and nzvi 50 nm 99 9 purity dk nano tech co ltd were added into egsb reactor with the final contents of 1200 and 1000 mg l respectively which were optimized with the orthogonal test in batch experiments high recirculation ratio was temporarily used to completely mix the gac nzvi and sludge 2 2 sludge and wastewater granular sludge obtained from uasb reactor of beer industry in harbin was used as the seed sludge the total suspended sludge tss of seed sludge was 22 38 g l and the ratio of volatile suspended sludge vss and tss was 0 63 sludge was stored at 4 c under anaerobic condition before use the seed amount was 66 7 v v of the effective volume at the start of experiments synthetic tetracycline wastewater was used in this work for feeding the reactor saccharose was used as carbon source with the concentration of 5 35 g l in addition 2 38 g nh4cl 0 6 g k2hpo4 1 48 g na2so4 0 25 g tetracycline and 10 ml trace element solution were added per liter to supply necessary nutrient for microbial growth the total cod of original solution for synthetic wastewater was approximate 6000 mg l the composition of the trace element solution in g l was as follows morita et al 2011 feso4 7h2o 0 1 nicl2 6h2o 0 04 mnso4 h2o 0 5

methods water quality parameters such as cod toc so4 2 s s2 mlss mlvss ph and orp were determined according to the standard methods apha 1998 the biogas production rate was measured with a wet gas meter lml 1 china while the composition h2 ch4 and co2 were determined using a gas chromatograph agilent 6890a usa sheng and yu 2007 for volatile fatty acids vfas measurement the mixed liquor slurry was first centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min then supernatant was acidified with formic acid 98 purity to ph below 2 and filtrated through with 0 22 μm acetate cellulose membranes and finally measured with a gas chromatograph agilent gc 7890a usa with flame ionization detector fid equipped with a hp innowax column the tetracycline concentration was determined using a liquid chromatograph lc 2010 shimadzu japan with variable wavelength uv vis detector equipped with a c18 column 4 6 150 mm wang et al 2017 mobile phase was a mixture of 60 acetonitrile and 40 deionized water containing 0 1 formic acid at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min and the detection wavelength was 273 nm the injection volume was 10 0 μl and the column temperature was set at 30 c fe in effluent was digested with concentrated nitric acid and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes four probe electrodes were used to measure the sludge conductivity before and after gac nzvi addition the sludge samples were collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min and washed three times with 0 1 m nacl the pellets were placed on the circle mold and freezed dried for 24 h the functional groups of organic matters in sludge were determined using ftir spectra the samples were freezed dried for 24 h and analyzed using a ftir spectrometer the scanning was conducted in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 cyclic voltammetry curve of sludge supernatant was measured in three electrodes electrolytic cell system using an autolab electrochemical workstation mixed liquor of sludge was firstly centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was transferred into electrolytic cell n2 was used to remove the influence of oxygen on electrode the scanning ranged from 1 v to 1 v with the rate of 10 mv s extracellular polymeric substance eps was extracted from the sludge mixture with a heat method sludge was first washed twice with npw then dissolved in nacl solution 0 85 heated in 80 c water bath for 30 min and finally centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 20 min at 4 c eps in the supernatant was the total of polysaccharides and proteins which were determined by the phenol sulfuric method and the bicinchoninic acid method with a total protein assay kit sigma respectively sem images were used to analyze the morphology and structure of granule sludge before and after gac nzvi addition at day 51 and 85 the aliquots was taken from egsb and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min the detail procedure for sem treatment was shown in our previous study zhang et al 2016 edx was used to determine the element contents of sludge 2 4 microbial community analysis the bacterial and archaea communities in egsb before and after gac nzvi mediator addition were investigated by

into operational taxonomic units otus by setting a 97 similarity using the mothur program rarefaction curves shannon diversity index and species richness estimator of chao 1 were generated for each sludge sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 impacts of gac nzvi on egsb performance fig 1 showed the orp and ph profiles of influent and effluent in egsb before and after gac nzvi addition orp could reflect the operational status of anaerobic reactor due to the higher height diameter ratio of egsb orp at the up and bottom of reactor might be different gac nzvi addition decreased orp from approximate 490 mv upper and 480 mv bottom to 500 mv and 490 mv respectively which was caused by the strong reducibility of zvi the influent ph was almost stabilized at 8 0 0 3 over the period of study while effluent ph firstly kept at about 7 8 0 1 then decreased to 7 3 at day 38 and finally increased to 7 6 0 1 the effluent ph was slightly lower than the influent which was caused by the acidization of tetracycline wastewater moreover ph decrease in day 33 51 might be due to the acid accumulation in the system while gac nzvi addition slightly increased the effluent ph though nzvi addition could neutralize parts of acidity in reactor sodium bicarbonate in influent and alkalinity produced in sulfate reduction process could completely neutralize vfas produced in egsb reactor as shown in fig 2 a the influent cod was stabilized at 5995 172 mg l while effluent cod was different at each stage before gac nzvi addition cod removal efficiency was kept stable at approximate 72 in first 28 d then decreased to 67 at day 37 and finally recovered to 70 5 the tolerant bacteria for tetracycline were accumulated in egsb after long time operation which ensured the high efficiency treatment of tetracycline wastewater moreover amounts of metabolites were accumulated in reactor during the long term operation which could inhibit the anaerobic microbial activity and result in decrease of cod removal in day 37 the recovery of cod removal indicated the inhibition could also be eliminated by long term acclimation gac nzvi addition could elevate cod removal to 79 increasing by 12 1 the reason was that gac nzvi could strengthen the interspecies electron transfer and synergic metabolic activity of anaerobic microbes while nzvi and the released fe2 could provide a suitable condition to strengthen the activity of anaerobic microbe moreover the fate of cod in egsb mainly contained residual in effluent using for methane production sulfate reduction and microbial growth metabolism etc in stable stage 7 1 gcod d 29 5 was discharged in effluent 6 91 gcod d 28 8 was used for methane production 2 55 gcod d 10 6 was used for sulfate reduction and 7 42 gcod d 30 9 was consumed for microbial growth metabolism by comparison at strengthen stage 5 0 gcod d 21 was discharged in effluent 10 9 gcod d 45 5 was used for methane production 2 58 gcod d 10 8 was used for sulfate reduction and 5 5 gcod d 22 9 was consumed for microbial growth metabolism fig 2b showed influent toc stabilized at approximate 2250 mg l the removal efficiency was kept at 81 in first 28 d then decreased slightly to 78 at 52 d and enhanced to 86 after media addition which had the similar trend with cod fig 2c showed the vfas variations in effluent of egsb acetate and butyrate were the predominant vfas in aqueous solution and the proportion was influenced by various factors including ph temperature and hydraulic retention time etc xu et al 2014 they were stabilized at about 450 and 240 mg l in first 27 d and then increased to 550 and 280 mg l until 52 d finally reduced to 350 and 170 mg l after gac nzvi addition the inhibition effects of tetracycline and its metabolites on hydrogen producing acetogens or methanogens might increase with the load enhancement and their accumulation in system resulting in the accumulation of vfas in reactor as shown in fig 2c it also indicated that gac nzvi did not change the metabolic type but a faster consumption of vfas which was good agreement with methane production profiles gac nzvi addition could promote the electron syntrophism of acetogenic bacteria and methanogens resulting in the rapid transformation of acetate and the elimination of products inhibition the decrease of butyrate also suggested that gac nzvi could accelerate the oxidization of butyrate to acetate gac nzvi addition had no impact on propionic acid and valeric acid contents which kept at 20 40 and 6 15 mg l during the study fig 2d showed the removal status of tetracycline in the reactor the influent tetracycline concentration was 250 mg l and removal efficiency was stabilized at 81 5 at the stable stage it decreased to 76 2 at day 37 and then it recovered to the previous level the slight decrease of tc removal on day 37 was caused by the inhibition effects of metabolic products generated in anaerobic degradation process of tetracycline while long term acclimation could eliminate this influence which was corresponding to the removal of cod and toc due to hydrolysis fermentation was not the rate limiting step of anaerobic degradation while tetracycline removal mainly depended on hydrolysis fermentation bacteria so gac nzvi addition had no evident influence on tetracycline removal fig 2e showed higher sulfate removal 94 5 were obtained in egsb system while gac nzvi addition could slightly enhance it to 95 6 compared with vfas and sulfate profiles the accumulated tetracycline and its metabolites did not caused evident inhibition on sulfate reducing bacteria srb while produced evident impacts on the activity of acetogenic bacteria and methanogens indicating srb was predominant in the competition with methanogens compared with cod or toc profiles enhancing degree of gac nzvi on sulfate was much lower than that for cod or toc which was relevant to the higher reduction rate of srb and the slower metabolic rate of methanogenesis moreover nzvi could serve as electron donor to reduce sulfate without srb promoting the removal efficiency of sulfate sulfide content almost kept constant at 245 mg l during the whole experiment which accounted for 74 2 of the total sulfur in effluent indicating that gac nzvi had no impact on sulfide production fig 2f showed the concentration variation of fe in effluent it was normally kept at 3 10 mg l except at day 60 and 80 it reached 43 and 25 mg l which was caused by the sludge washout from reactor fe content in influent was only detected at 1 92 mg l the lost fe weight after gac nzvi addition was calculated as 1 01 g based on the fe concentration and flux which was only 4 04 of the injected nzvi it indicated that the loss of nzvi was not serious during the egsb operation nzvi could adsorb on the surface of anaerobic microbes and be coated by extracellular polymeric substances eps secreting from microbes which would prevent the loss of nzvi 3 2 impacts of gac nzvi on biogas composition and production as key parameters to evaluate the anaerobic digestion process the composition and contents of biogas were measured during the operation of egsb as shown in fig 3 before gac nzvi addition biogas production rate firstly stabilized at 5 4 l d then slightly decreased to 4 6 l d and finally increased to 5 2 l d which might be caused by the toxicity of tetracycline and its metabolite after gac nnzvi addition biogas production rate reached to 6 3 l d increasing by 21 2 which was higher than the increasing amplitude of toc removal gac nzvi addition could neutralize some vfas to produce more h2 and reduce the alkalinity which could further reduce co2 to ch4 the biogas production rate was also affected by gac nzvi addition methane production rate increased from 115 3 27 4 ml gcod to 199 4 21 2 ml gcod while co2 and h2 decreased from 50 8 3 6 ml gcod and 31 0 1 7 ml gcod to 46 2 10 1 ml gcod and 16 2 5 1 ml gcod respectively results showed that biogas and methane contents were improved with the addition of gac nzvi mediator the higher methane production might be caused by four possible roles of gac nzvi first the conductive characteristics enabled gac and nzvi acting as electronic channel to adjust electric syntrophy between hydrolytic acidification bacteria and methanogens thus facilitating methane production kato et al 2012 second the reduction and oxidation cycle of fe3 fe2 and nzvi accelerated the electron flow from the oxidation of acetate to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis jiang et al 2013 third the dominant methanosaeta species in gac nzvi dosed egsb reactor could conduct the direct interspecies electron transfer diet with iron reducing bacteria feng et al 2014 liu et al 2012 rotaru et al 2014 reported that geobacter metallireducens could offer electrons to methanosaeta harundinacea via diet during reduction of co2 to ch4 in defined co cultures finally nzvi and produced h2 could serve as electron donor for autotrophic methanogenesis to reduce co2 into ch4 resulting the improvement of methane production and consumption of co2 and h2 based on the following reactions zhen et al 2015 which was consistent with the measured data in fig 3b 1 c o 2 4 f e 0 8 h c h 4 4 f e 2 2 h 2 o 2 c o 2 4 h 2 c h 4 2 h 2 o 3 3 impacts of gac nzvi on sludge characteristics sem and edx images of the sludge samples in egsb through the experiments were given in fig 4 compared with the loose and rough surface of sludge in stable stage the sludge presented a compact and rigid appearance after gac nzvi addition fig 4a and c moreover gac nzvi promoted the formation of a multi layer structure in the system where bacillus and cocci were dominated in the inner and surface of sludge and intertwined closely with the mediator fig 4c and e however bacillus formed a uniform structure on the surface of sludge before gac nzvi addition fig 4a zhang et al 2011b reported that cocci shaped species on the surface and filamentous species in the inner of sludge in zvi packed reactor were related to acidogens and methanothrix sem observations showed that gac nzvi were tightly coated by bacteria and eps resulting in densely packed aggregates which could prevent nzvi piercing into cells for cytotoxicity reduction xu et al 2015 also found bacteria attached on gac could present larger aggregates in the pores of tens μm by closely clustering with eps gac nzvi could provide abundant micropore structures for acidogens and methanogens to grow while eps surrounded microbes might also play a crucial role in enhancing the interspecies mass and electron transfer edx analysis indicated that fe content in sludge was 21 6 at the first day injection which was close to the theoretical value 25 indicating it was suitable to exhibit the element composition in sludge fig 4b d and f after 34 d operation fe content in sludge was 20 43 with the loss rate of 5 4 indicating the loss of gac nzvi mediator was not serious which was also verified by the lower fe concentration in effluent the ft ir profiles of anaerobic sludge before and after gac nzvi exposure were depicted in fig 5 a the locations of absorbance peaks were almost not influenced by gac nzvi addition while their quantities were evidently changed indicating the chemical bonds on the surface of anaerobic sludge remained unchanged the peak at 3300 cm 1 was the o h stretching vibration of organic acid in sludge and increased by 12 8 gac nzvi addition could induce more eps production which might promote the interspecies electron transfer to produce more organic acid moreover the peak at 1450 cm 1 was the adsorption of co3 2 gac nzvi addition could enhance co2 reduction with hydrogen while the released fe2 could react with aqueous co2 to form feco3 which comprehensively reduced the co3 2 peak by 3 1 fig 5b showed the electrical conductivity of sludge at stable stage was 6 3 0 2 μs cm this was comparable to previously reported conductivities 6 7 μs cm of sludge in an industrial scale bioreactor and a lab scale bioreactor inoculating from the industrial system morita et al 2011 gac nzvi exposure significantly enhanced it to 498 8 75 2 μs cm which was increased by 79 times suggesting that the compact aggregates of gac nzvi and anaerobes might facilitate direct interspecies electron transfer meanwhile there were intrinsic correlation between the bacterial community composition and electrical conductivity of anaerobic sludge aggregates shrestha et al 2014 eps produced by anaerobic sludge was separated into loosely bound eps lb eps and tight binding eps tb eps as shown in fig 5c gac nzvi could enhance lb eps and tb eps from 79 to 240 mg g mlvss to 147 and 516 mg g mlvss respectively suggesting that exogenous mediators could promote eps induction to strengthen the interspecies electron transfer and anaerobic digestion effects tb eps was the main eps in anaerobic sludge and polysaccharide content was higher than the protein gac nzvi could also increase the ratio of polysaccharide and protein in lb eps and tb eps from 1 47 to 1 77 to 3 and 3 57 respectively which was located in normal range of anaerobic sludge 0 2 4 2 indicating that no evident cell lysis components was found in eps secreted by anaerobic microbes and nanoparticles had good biocompatibility with anaerobic sludge as shown in the voltammogram fig 5d the oxidation and reduction peak of supernatant in egsb at stable stage was observed at 0 13 and 0 43 v versus sce with the peak current of 0 41 and 0 83 μa while they were kept at 0 12 and 0 38 v after 34 d of gac nzvi addition with the peak current increasing to 0 71 and 1 02 μa it suggested that gac nzvi almost did not influence the type of redox reaction but improve the activity by inducing more oxidation and reduction substances which might serve as electron shuttle to accelerate the extracellular indirect electron transfer moreover due to microbe was removed from test system the peaks for acetate oxidation and methane production from co2 were not observed in this study beese vasbender et al 2015 strycharz et al 2011 3 4 impacts of gac nzvi on microbiological community to observe the microbial community changes in egsb before and after addition of gac nzvi the richness and diversity of species were studied using illumina high throughput sequencing after addition of gac nzvi the chao 1 richness index and shannon diversity index of bacteria were increased from 5705 to 4 27 to 8495 and 4 87 respectively it indicated that gac nzvi promoted the degradation of toxic compound in tetracycline wastewater the taxonomic distributions of bacterial community were determined at phylum class and genus levels as shown in fig 6 a c at phylum level fig 6a 12 identified phyla were detected with firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria spirochaetes chloroflexi thermotogae and synergistetes as the dominant ones the total abundance of seven bacterial phyla before and after gac nzvi addition was 90 32 and 85 17 respectively the former six phyla was mainly hydrolysis fermentation bacteria which could transfer the carbon sources in tetracycline wastewater to vfa and further transform them to acetic acid h2 and co2 while synergistetes was mainly syntrophus bacteria in firmicutes always contained endospore to resist the bad environment while spirochaetes and chloroflexi could degrade the complex compound and be crucial to tetracycline removal roest et al 2005 gac nzvi addition did not change the species but the abundances firmicutes bacteroidetes and proteobacteria decreased from 26 23 20 59 and 18 69 19 49 15 45 and 12 58 after gac nzvi addition while chloroflexi thermotogae and synergistetes evidently increase from 6 39 3 83 and 3 19 15 42 7 28 and 3 65 respectively moreover spirochaetes was not influenced by gac nzvi addition due to acidification and methanation was an integrated process in anaerobic treatment the changes in acidobacteria community would affect the methanogenesis process which would influence the treating efficiency of egsb at class level fig 6b total of 21 bacterial classes were detected in sludge and the majority of sequences belonged to 8 classes including bacteroidia clostridia spirochaetia deltaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria negativicutes anaerolineae and thermotogae after gac nzvi addition bacteroidia clostridia deltaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and negativicutes decreased while anaerolineae and thermotogae increased and others were kept almost stable it was noteworthy that gac nzvi increased the unclassified bacteria from 4 82 to 10 9 at class levels as shown in fig 6c a total of 21 genera were classified in egsb reactor treponema desulfovibrio klebsiella and levilinea dominated in the samples after addition of gac nzvi the abundance of treponema increased from 8 95 to 14 29 which was a chemoheterotrophic bacteria and had the ability for the degradation of complex compounds it indicated that gac nzvi improved the resistance ability for tetracycline and its metabolite in egsb resulting in higher treating efficiency of wastewater desulfovibrio an incomplete oxidation type of sulfate reducing bacteria could produce acetic acid and co2 by oxidation of organic matters and use h as electron acceptor for sulfate reduction due to addition of nzvi could reduce h desulfovibrio abundance decreased from 8 28 to 5 7 while higher sulfate removal efficiency indicated that this genus had higher specific degradation rate klebsiella had the resistance for tetracycline and could maintain the stable operation of egsb at high tetracycline concentration which decreased from 6 65 to 3 81 levilinea evidently increased from 1 38 to 4 51 which could produce acetic acid co2 and h2 by fermenting of carbohydrate or cooperating with methanogens for propionic acid and butyric acid degradation tao et al 2010 it indicated that gac nzvi could improve the ability of acetic acid production and resistance for tetracycline and its metabolite in egsb gac nzvi addition could also increase the chao 1 richness index and shannon diversity index of archaea from 458 to 1 66 to 749 and 1 86 respectively the phylogenetic classification of effective archaeal sequences from egsb sludge at phylum class and genus levels was summarized in fig 6 d f at phylum level fig 6d gac nzvi addition decreased the abundance of euryarchaeota from 98 16 to 96 5 while increased crenarchaeota from 1 82 to 3 45 revealing that the dominant community was not affected by the medium at class level fig 6e total of 7 archaeal communities were detected and the majority of sequences belonged to 4 classes after addition of gac nzvi the abundance of methanomicrobia and thermoprotei increased from 46 73 to 1 82 64 13 and 3 45 while the abundance of methanobacteria and thermoplasmata decreased from 27 97 to 23 43 17 75 and 13 35 respectively further analysis was conducted at genus level to see the influence of gac nzvi on the community structure and functional microbes fig 6f a total 16 genera were classified among the two sludge samples methanosaeta methanobacterium thermogymnomonas methanosarcina and methanoculleus dominated in the samples after gac nzvi addition methanosaeta abundance increased from 33 81 to 57 33 while the abundances of methanobacterium thermogymnomonas methanosarcina and methanoculleus decreased from 26 98 23 38 8 49 and 2 4 15 31 13 22 3 11 and 0 8 respectively methanosaeta was strict anaerobe and could only use acetic acid as the substrate to produce methane while methanobacterium was hydrogen nutritional methanogens which could produce methane by reducing co2 with h2 and formic acid methanosarcina could use several substrates including acetic acid h2 co2 and methylated compound after addition of gac nzvi the abundances of syntrophomonas and syntrophus typical hydrogen producing acetogenic bacteria using butyric acid would increase resulting in accumulation of acetic acid which would promote the growth of methanosaeta and then consumed more acetic acid this phenomenon was consistent with the monitoring results of egsb effluent moreover the total contents of methanogens after gac nzvi addition were also increased from 74 7 to 81 74 resulting in more methane production which was also in accord with the gas production data in egsb 4 conclusions the addition of nano mediators is a feasible technology to improve pollutant removal and methane production in anaerobic process after gac nzvi injection cod removal increased by 12 1 tetracycline and sulfate removal almost kept constant while biogas output and methane content increased by 21 2 and 26 9 respectively gac nzvi prompted the formation of densely packed aggregates and multi layer structure in sludge and increased the eps content surrounded microbes and the conductivities of sludge which played a significant role in enhancing the interspecies mass and electron transfer 94 6 of fe accumulated in sludge during 34 d operation with the sludge content of 20 43 gac nzvi evidently changed the bacterial and methanogenic community structure with the treponema and methanosaeta as the dominant strains in the gac nzvi dosed egsb reactor the results would provide the theoretical basis and technological supports for enhancing the treatment efficiency and energy

19647,packing nano mediators into anaerobic system is an attractive technology to strengthen refractory pollutant removal and methane production from wastewater but is limited by the drawbacks such as easy loss and poor mass transfer in this study gac nzvi mediator was added into egsb reactor to investigate the enhancement effects and mechanism for anaerobic digestion of tetracycline wastewater and its impacts on microbial community structure the results indicated that gac nzvi could enhance cod and toc removal by 12 1 and 10 3 while have no evident influence on tetracycline removal and sulfide production the biogas production and methane content were increased by 21 2 and 26 9 respectively gac nzvi addition resulted in formation of densely packed aggregates and evidently increased the electrical conductivity and eps content in sludge fe content in sludge was 20 43 with the loss of only 5 4 during 34 d operation microbial community analysis revealed that gac nzvi addition could both increase the chao 1 richness index and shannon diversity index of bacteria and archaea it was notable that total methanogens contents increased from 74 7 to 81 74 at genera level resulting in higher methane production while treponema increase might promote the degradation of tetracycline and its metabolite leading to higher cod removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion tetracycline wastewater strengthening gac nzvi mediator methane production 1 introduction tetracycline tc as the cheapest antibiotics with a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity had been widely used in many areas such as human and veterinary medicine zhang et al 2014 tc production wastewater contained high contents of residual antibiotics and by products with the higher cod 15000 mg l ammonium 300 mg l and sulfate 2000 mg l levels and treated effluent was considered as the important source of antibiotic pollution in environment li et al 2004 2008a the tetracycline residue in mother liquor was reported in extremely high levels 844 1077 mg l while that in wastewater treatment plants ranged from several to dozens of mg l even after dilution li et al 2008b due to lower sludge handling costs higher energy efficiency and lower chemical usage comparing with aerobic treatment anaerobic digestion had been normally used for high concentration antibiotic wastewater and sludge treatment as well as biogas production latif et al 2011 however presence of high concentration tc and its biodegradation intermediates in wastewater could disturb the stability of anaerobic biological treatment due to their strong bacteriostatic action which would decrease the treatment efficiency and inhibit biogas production deng et al 2012 the best ways to ensure high efficiency treatment of tc wastewater was to destroy the antibacterial activity of tc and strength the microorganism activity various advanced oxidation process aops such as photocatalytic degradation electro coagulation ultrasonic induced processes uv h2o2 h2o2 o3 fenton electro fenton and photo fenton showed a good performance for tc removal and transformation from the aqueous environment chen et al 2017 jorfi et al 2016 liu et al 2016 yang et al 2016 however high coexisting organic matters in tc production wastewater interfered with tc removal and greatly increased the operation costs which limited aops application in tc wastewater treatment anaerobic biological treatment was a feasible selection for high efficient and low costs treatment of tc wastewater introducing conductive mediator materials into anaerobic digester could help to reinforce the syntrophic actions between bacteria and methanogens and therefore to enhance the metabolic activity for pollutants and the digester s effectiveness zhao et al 2015 carbon based and iron based materials were the commonly used conductive mediators to improve the performance and microbial activity in anaerobic process previous studies reported that conductive carbon materials including biochar granular activated carbon gac carbon cloth and carbon nanotubes could strengthen ethanol transfer to methane via direct interspecies electron transfer diet between special species such as geobacter metallireducens and methanosarcina barkeri or mixture culture in methanogenic sludge chen et al 2014a 2014b li et al 2015 liu et al 2012 luo et al 2015 injection of conductive carbon materials into continuous flow reactors were also found to enhance the transformation of acetate ethanol to methane and the loading rates without failed operation and the mediators might help to degrade the complex organic matters lee et al 2016 xu et al 2015 as a reducing agent zero valent iron zvi could help to create an anaerobic environment which might improve the performance of anaerobic process and alter the community structure of dominant bacteria in anaerobic digesters feng et al 2014 yang et al 2013 zvi addition in bioreactor could provide a more favorable environment for anaerobic microbes by rapidly lowering the oxidation reduction potential orp and buffering acid while h2 produced by iron corrosion could serve as electron donor for hydrogen consuming microorganisms such as methanogenic archaea and denitrifying bacteria son et al 2006 zhang et al 2011c recently zvi packed anaerobic reactor were developed to enhance treatment efficiency of sulfate wastewater azo dye decolorization and sludge digestion resulting in higher cod removal methane production and sulfate reduction feng et al 2014 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2011a other iron materials such as magnetite iron oxide nanoparticles and iron shavings were also used to enhance microbiological activity and methane production in anaerobic condition ambuchi et al 2017 ou et al 2016 however previous studies almost all used the single mediator and the promotion removal efficiency and mechanisms for refractory pollution were not very clear whether the composite mediators had promotion effects for anaerobic digestion process and the relation of microbial community and mediators were also needed further investigation the objectives of the present study were to 1 investigate whether the composite conductive mediators could enhance the conversion of antibiotics and methane production in anaerobic digesters 2 clarify the strengthening mechanisms of mediators on the metabolism of anaerobic microbes in egsb and 3 resolve the relation of mediator and microbial community structure 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor design and operation experiments were conducted in a lab scale egsb reactor with an effective volume of 4 l internal diameter of 8 0 cm height of 120 cm and an overall volume of 7 5 l the reactor was made with strong plexiglass and temperature was controlled at 35 1 c with a thermostat heating system to improve mixing effluent was partially pumped back to the inlet and the up flow velocity was constant at 0 7 m h by controlling the recirculation ratio of 20 1 the hrt of egsb was set as 24 h with the organic loading rate of 5 06 kg cod m3 d biogas and solids were separated from the liquid phase with a gas liquid solids separator at the top of column ph and orp probes were equipped in reactor to real timely measure the ph value and orp after stabilized operating for 51 d gac 1 2 mm tianjin benchmark instrument co ltd and nzvi 50 nm 99 9 purity dk nano tech co ltd were added into egsb reactor with the final contents of 1200 and 1000 mg l respectively which were optimized with the orthogonal test in batch experiments high recirculation ratio was temporarily used to completely mix the gac nzvi and sludge 2 2 sludge and wastewater granular sludge obtained from uasb reactor of beer industry in harbin was used as the seed sludge the total suspended sludge tss of seed sludge was 22 38 g l and the ratio of volatile suspended sludge vss and tss was 0 63 sludge was stored at 4 c under anaerobic condition before use the seed amount was 66 7

35 g l in addition 2 38 g nh4cl 0 6 g k2hpo4 1 48 g na2so4 0 25 g tetracycline and 10 ml trace element solution were added per liter to supply necessary nutrient for microbial growth the total cod of original solution for synthetic wastewater was approximate 6000 mg l the composition of the trace element solution in g l was as follows morita et al 2011 feso4 7h2o 0 1 nicl2 6h2o 0 04 mnso4 h2o 0 5

shimadzu japan with variable wavelength uv vis detector equipped with a c18 column 4 6 150 mm wang et al 2017 mobile phase was a mixture of 60 acetonitrile and 40 deionized water containing 0 1 formic acid at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min and the detection wavelength was 273 nm the injection volume was 10 0 μl and the column temperature was set at 30 c fe in effluent was digested with concentrated nitric acid and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes four probe electrodes were used to measure the sludge conductivity before and after gac nzvi addition the sludge samples were collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min and washed three times with 0 1 m nacl the pellets were placed on the circle mold and freezed dried for 24 h the functional groups of organic matters in sludge were determined using ftir spectra the samples were freezed dried for 24 h and analyzed using a ftir spectrometer the scanning was conducted in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 cyclic voltammetry curve of sludge supernatant was measured in three electrodes electrolytic cell system using an autolab electrochemical workstation mixed liquor of sludge was firstly centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was transferred into electrolytic cell n2 was used to remove the influence of oxygen on electrode the scanning ranged from 1 v to 1 v with the rate of 10 mv s extracellular polymeric substance eps was extracted from the sludge mixture with a heat method sludge was first washed twice with npw then dissolved in nacl solution 0 85 heated in 80 c water bath for 30 min and finally centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 20 min at 4 c eps in the supernatant was the total of polysaccharides and proteins which were determined by the phenol sulfuric method and the bicinchoninic acid method with a total protein assay kit sigma respectively sem images were used to analyze the morphology and structure of granule sludge before and after gac nzvi addition at day 51 and 85 the aliquots was taken from egsb and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min the detail procedure for sem treatment was shown in our previous study zhang et al 2016 edx was used to determine the element contents of sludge 2 4 microbial community analysis the bacterial and archaea communities in egsb before and after gac nzvi mediator addition were investigated by

sludge sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 impacts of gac nzvi on egsb performance fig 1 showed the orp and ph profiles of influent and effluent in egsb before and after gac nzvi addition orp could reflect the operational status of anaerobic reactor due to the higher height diameter ratio of egsb orp at the up and bottom of reactor might be different gac nzvi addition decreased orp from approximate 490 mv upper and 480 mv bottom to 500 mv and 490 mv respectively which was caused by the strong reducibility of zvi the influent ph was almost stabilized at 8 0 0 3 over the period of study while effluent ph firstly kept at about 7 8 0 1 then decreased to 7 3 at day 38 and finally increased to 7 6 0 1 the effluent ph was slightly lower than the influent which was caused by the acidization of tetracycline wastewater moreover ph decrease in day 33 51 might be due to the acid accumulation in the system while gac nzvi addition slightly increased the effluent ph though nzvi addition could neutralize parts of acidity in reactor sodium bicarbonate in influent and alkalinity produced in sulfate reduction process could completely neutralize vfas produced in egsb reactor as shown in fig 2 a the influent cod was stabilized at 5995 172 mg l while effluent cod was different at each stage before gac nzvi addition cod removal efficiency was kept stable at approximate 72 in first 28 d then decreased to 67 at day 37 and finally recovered to 70 5 the tolerant bacteria for tetracycline were accumulated in egsb after long time operation which ensured the high efficiency treatment of tetracycline wastewater moreover amounts of metabolites were accumulated in reactor during the long term operation which could inhibit the anaerobic microbial activity and result in decrease of cod removal in day 37 the recovery of cod removal indicated the inhibition could also be eliminated by long term acclimation gac nzvi addition could elevate cod removal to 79 increasing by 12 1 the reason was that gac nzvi could strengthen the interspecies electron transfer and synergic metabolic activity of anaerobic microbes while nzvi and the released fe2 could provide a suitable condition to strengthen the activity of anaerobic microbe moreover the fate of cod in egsb mainly contained residual in effluent using for methane production sulfate reduction and microbial growth metabolism etc in stable stage 7 1 gcod d 29 5 was discharged in effluent 6 91 gcod d 28 8 was used for methane production 2 55 gcod d 10 6 was used for sulfate reduction and 7 42 gcod d 30 9 was consumed for microbial growth metabolism by comparison at strengthen stage 5 0 gcod d 21 was discharged in effluent 10 9 gcod d 45 5 was used for methane production 2 58 gcod d 10 8 was used for sulfate reduction and 5 5 gcod d 22 9 was consumed for microbial growth metabolism fig 2b showed influent toc stabilized at approximate 2250 mg l the removal efficiency was kept at 81 in first 28 d then decreased slightly to 78 at 52 d and enhanced to 86 after media addition which had the similar trend with cod fig 2c showed the vfas variations in effluent of egsb acetate and butyrate were the predominant vfas in aqueous solution and the proportion was influenced by various factors including ph temperature and hydraulic retention time etc xu et al 2014 they were stabilized at about 450 and 240 mg l in first 27 d and then increased to 550 and 280 mg l until 52 d finally reduced to 350 and 170 mg l after gac nzvi addition the inhibition effects of tetracycline and its metabolites on hydrogen producing acetogens or methanogens might increase with the load enhancement and their accumulation in system resulting in the accumulation of vfas in reactor as shown in fig 2c it also indicated that gac nzvi did not change the metabolic type but a faster consumption of vfas which was good agreement with methane production profiles gac nzvi addition could promote the electron syntrophism of acetogenic bacteria and methanogens resulting in the rapid transformation of acetate and the elimination of products inhibition the decrease of butyrate also suggested that gac nzvi could accelerate the oxidization of butyrate to acetate gac nzvi addition had no impact on propionic acid and valeric acid contents which kept at 20 40 and 6 15 mg l during the study fig 2d showed the removal status of tetracycline in the reactor the influent tetracycline concentration was 250 mg l and removal efficiency was stabilized at 81 5 at the stable stage it decreased to 76 2 at day 37 and then it recovered to the previous level the slight decrease of tc removal on day 37 was caused by the inhibition effects of metabolic products generated in anaerobic degradation process of tetracycline while long term acclimation could eliminate this influence which was corresponding to the removal of cod and toc due to hydrolysis fermentation was not the rate limiting step of anaerobic degradation while tetracycline removal mainly depended on hydrolysis fermentation bacteria so gac nzvi addition had no evident influence on tetracycline removal fig 2e showed higher sulfate removal 94 5 were obtained in egsb system while gac nzvi addition could slightly enhance it to 95 6 compared with vfas and sulfate profiles the accumulated tetracycline and its metabolites did not caused evident inhibition on sulfate reducing bacteria srb while produced evident impacts on the activity of acetogenic bacteria and methanogens indicating srb was predominant in the competition with methanogens compared with cod or toc profiles enhancing degree of gac nzvi on sulfate was much lower than that for cod or toc which was relevant to the higher reduction rate of srb and the slower metabolic rate of methanogenesis moreover nzvi could serve as electron donor to reduce sulfate without srb promoting the removal efficiency of sulfate sulfide content almost kept constant at 245 mg l during the whole experiment which accounted for 74 2 of the total sulfur in effluent indicating that gac nzvi had no impact on sulfide production fig 2f showed the concentration variation of fe in effluent it was normally kept at 3 10 mg l except at day 60 and 80 it reached 43 and 25 mg l which was caused by the sludge washout from reactor fe content in influent was only detected at 1 92 mg l the lost fe weight after gac nzvi addition was calculated as 1 01 g based on the fe concentration and flux which was only 4 04 of the injected nzvi it indicated that the loss of nzvi was not serious during the egsb operation nzvi could adsorb on the surface of anaerobic microbes and be coated by extracellular polymeric substances eps secreting from microbes which would prevent the loss of nzvi 3 2 impacts of gac nzvi on biogas composition and production as key parameters to evaluate the anaerobic digestion process the composition and contents of biogas were measured during the operation of egsb as shown in fig 3 before gac nzvi addition biogas production rate firstly stabilized at 5 4 l d then slightly decreased to 4 6 l d and finally increased to 5 2 l d which might be caused by the toxicity of tetracycline and its metabolite after gac nnzvi addition biogas production rate reached to 6 3 l d increasing by 21 2 which was higher than the increasing amplitude of toc removal gac nzvi addition could neutralize some vfas to produce more h2 and reduce the alkalinity which could further reduce co2 to ch4 the biogas production rate was also affected by gac nzvi addition methane production rate increased from 115 3 27 4 ml gcod to 199 4 21 2 ml gcod while co2 and h2 decreased from 50 8 3 6 ml gcod and 31 0 1 7 ml gcod to 46 2 10 1 ml gcod and 16 2 5 1 ml gcod respectively results showed that biogas and methane contents were improved with the addition of gac nzvi mediator the higher methane production might be caused by four possible roles of gac nzvi first the conductive characteristics enabled gac and nzvi acting as electronic channel to adjust electric syntrophy between hydrolytic acidification bacteria and methanogens thus facilitating methane production kato et al 2012 second the reduction and oxidation cycle of fe3 fe2 and nzvi accelerated the electron flow from the oxidation of acetate to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis jiang et al 2013 third the dominant methanosaeta species in gac nzvi dosed egsb reactor could conduct the direct interspecies electron transfer diet with iron reducing bacteria feng et al 2014 liu et al 2012 rotaru et al 2014 reported that geobacter metallireducens could offer electrons to methanosaeta harundinacea via diet during reduction of co2 to ch4 in defined co cultures finally nzvi and produced h2 could serve as electron donor for autotrophic methanogenesis to reduce co2 into ch4 resulting the improvement of methane production and consumption of co2 and h2 based on the following reactions zhen et al 2015 which was consistent with the measured data in fig 3b 1 c o 2 4 f e 0 8 h c h 4 4 f e 2 2 h 2 o 2 c o 2 4 h 2 c h 4 2 h 2 o 3 3 impacts of gac nzvi on sludge characteristics sem and edx images of the sludge samples in egsb through the experiments were given in fig 4 compared with the loose and rough surface of sludge in stable stage the sludge presented a compact and rigid appearance after gac nzvi addition fig 4a and c moreover gac nzvi promoted the formation of a multi layer structure in the system where bacillus and cocci were dominated in the inner and surface of sludge and intertwined closely with the mediator fig 4c and e however bacillus formed a uniform structure on the surface of sludge before gac nzvi addition fig 4a zhang et al 2011b reported that cocci shaped species on the surface and filamentous species in the inner of sludge in zvi packed reactor were related to acidogens and methanothrix sem observations showed that gac nzvi were tightly coated by bacteria and eps resulting in densely packed aggregates which could prevent nzvi piercing into cells for cytotoxicity reduction xu et al 2015 also found bacteria attached on gac could present larger aggregates in the pores of tens μm by closely clustering with eps gac nzvi could provide abundant micropore structures for acidogens and methanogens to grow while eps surrounded microbes might also play a crucial role in enhancing the interspecies mass and electron transfer edx analysis indicated that fe content in sludge was 21 6 at the first day injection which was close to the theoretical value 25 indicating it was suitable to exhibit the element composition in sludge fig 4b d and f after 34 d operation fe content in sludge was 20 43 with the loss rate of 5 4 indicating the loss of gac nzvi mediator was not serious which was also verified by the lower fe concentration in effluent the ft ir profiles of anaerobic sludge before and after gac nzvi exposure were depicted in fig 5 a the locations of absorbance peaks were almost not influenced by gac nzvi addition while their quantities were evidently changed indicating the chemical bonds on the surface of anaerobic sludge remained unchanged the peak at 3300 cm 1 was the o h stretching vibration of organic acid in sludge and increased by 12 8 gac nzvi addition could induce more eps production which might promote the interspecies electron transfer to produce more organic acid moreover the peak at 1450 cm 1 was the adsorption of co3 2 gac nzvi addition could enhance co2 reduction with hydrogen while the released fe2 could react with aqueous co2 to form feco3 which comprehensively reduced the co3 2 peak by 3 1 fig 5b showed the electrical conductivity of sludge at stable stage was 6 3 0 2 μs cm this was comparable to previously reported conductivities 6 7 μs cm of sludge in an industrial scale bioreactor and a lab scale bioreactor inoculating from the industrial system morita et al 2011 gac nzvi exposure significantly enhanced it to 498 8 75 2 μs cm which was increased by 79 times suggesting that the compact aggregates of gac nzvi and anaerobes might facilitate direct interspecies electron transfer meanwhile there were intrinsic correlation between the bacterial community composition and electrical conductivity of anaerobic sludge aggregates shrestha et al 2014 eps produced by anaerobic sludge was separated into loosely bound eps lb eps and tight binding eps tb eps as shown in fig 5c gac nzvi could enhance lb eps and tb eps from 79 to 240 mg g mlvss to 147 and 516 mg g mlvss respectively suggesting that exogenous mediators could promote eps induction to strengthen the interspecies electron transfer and anaerobic digestion effects tb eps was the main eps in anaerobic sludge and polysaccharide content was higher than the protein gac nzvi could also increase the ratio of polysaccharide and protein in lb eps and tb eps from 1 47 to 1 77 to 3 and 3 57 respectively which was located in normal range of anaerobic sludge 0 2 4 2 indicating that no evident cell lysis components was found in eps secreted by anaerobic microbes and nanoparticles had good biocompatibility with anaerobic sludge as shown in the voltammogram fig 5d the oxidation and reduction peak of supernatant in egsb at stable stage was observed at 0 13 and 0 43 v versus sce with the peak current of 0 41 and 0 83 μa while they were kept at 0 12 and 0 38 v after 34 d of gac nzvi addition with the peak current increasing to 0 71 and 1 02 μa it suggested that gac nzvi almost did not influence the type of redox reaction but improve the activity by inducing more oxidation and reduction substances which might serve as electron shuttle to accelerate the extracellular indirect electron transfer moreover due to microbe was removed from test system the peaks for acetate oxidation and methane production from co2 were not observed in this study beese vasbender et al 2015 strycharz et al 2011 3 4 impacts of gac nzvi on microbiological community to observe the microbial community changes in egsb before and after addition of gac nzvi the richness and diversity of species were studied using illumina high throughput sequencing after addition of gac nzvi the chao 1 richness index and shannon diversity index of bacteria were increased from 5705 to 4 27 to 8495 and 4 87 respectively it indicated that gac nzvi promoted the degradation of toxic compound in tetracycline wastewater the taxonomic distributions of bacterial community were determined at phylum class and genus levels as shown in fig 6 a c at phylum level fig 6a 12 identified phyla were detected with firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria spirochaetes chloroflexi thermotogae and synergistetes as the dominant ones the total abundance of seven bacterial phyla before and after gac nzvi addition was 90 32 and 85 17 respectively the former six phyla was mainly hydrolysis fermentation bacteria which could transfer the carbon sources in tetracycline wastewater to vfa and further transform them to acetic acid h2 and co2 while synergistetes was mainly syntrophus bacteria in firmicutes always contained endospore to resist the bad environment while spirochaetes and chloroflexi could degrade the complex compound and be crucial to tetracycline removal roest et al 2005 gac nzvi addition did not change the species but the abundances firmicutes bacteroidetes and proteobacteria decreased from 26 23 20 59 and 18 69 19 49 15 45 and 12 58 after gac nzvi addition while chloroflexi thermotogae and synergistetes evidently increase from 6 39 3 83 and 3 19 15 42 7 28 and 3 65 respectively moreover spirochaetes was not influenced by gac nzvi addition due to acidification and methanation was an integrated process in anaerobic treatment the changes in acidobacteria community would affect the methanogenesis process which would influence the treating efficiency of egsb at class level fig 6b total of 21 bacterial classes were detected in sludge and the majority of sequences belonged to 8 classes including bacteroidia clostridia spirochaetia deltaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria negativicutes anaerolineae and thermotogae after gac nzvi addition bacteroidia clostridia deltaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and negativicutes decreased while anaerolineae and thermotogae increased and others were kept almost stable it was noteworthy that gac nzvi increased the unclassified bacteria from 4 82 to 10 9 at class levels as shown in fig 6c a total of 21 genera were classified in egsb reactor treponema desulfovibrio klebsiella and levilinea dominated in the samples after addition of gac nzvi the abundance of treponema increased from 8 95 to 14 29 which was a chemoheterotrophic bacteria and had the ability for the degradation of complex compounds it indicated that gac nzvi improved the resistance ability for tetracycline and its metabolite in egsb resulting in higher treating efficiency of wastewater desulfovibrio an incomplete oxidation type of sulfate reducing bacteria could produce acetic acid and co2 by oxidation of organic matters and use h as electron acceptor for sulfate reduction due to addition of nzvi could reduce h desulfovibrio abundance decreased from 8 28 to 5 7 while higher sulfate removal efficiency indicated that this genus had higher specific degradation rate klebsiella had the resistance for tetracycline and could maintain the stable operation of egsb at high tetracycline concentration which decreased from 6 65 to 3 81 levilinea evidently increased from 1 38 to 4 51 which could produce acetic acid co2 and h2 by fermenting of carbohydrate or cooperating with methanogens for propionic acid and butyric acid degradation tao et al 2010 it indicated that gac nzvi could improve the ability of acetic acid production and resistance for tetracycline and its metabolite in egsb gac nzvi addition could also increase the chao 1 richness index and shannon diversity index of archaea from 458 to 1 66 to 749 and 1 86 respectively the phylogenetic classification of effective archaeal sequences from egsb sludge at phylum class and genus levels was summarized in fig 6 d f at phylum level fig 6d gac nzvi addition decreased the abundance of euryarchaeota from 98 16 to 96 5 while increased crenarchaeota from 1 82 to 3 45 revealing that the dominant community was not affected by the medium at class level fig 6e total of 7 archaeal communities were detected and the majority of sequences belonged to 4 classes after addition of gac nzvi the abundance of methanomicrobia and thermoprotei increased from 46 73 to 1 82 64 13 and 3 45 while the abundance of methanobacteria and thermoplasmata decreased from 27 97 to 23 43 17 75 and 13 35 respectively further analysis was conducted at genus level to see the influence of gac nzvi on the community structure and functional microbes fig 6f a total 16 genera were classified among the two sludge samples methanosaeta methanobacterium thermogymnomonas methanosarcina and methanoculleus dominated in the samples after gac nzvi addition methanosaeta abundance increased from 33 81 to 57 33 while the abundances of methanobacterium thermogymnomonas methanosarcina and methanoculleus decreased from 26 98 23 38 8 49 and 2 4 15 31 13 22 3 11 and 0 8 respectively methanosaeta was strict anaerobe and could only use acetic acid as the substrate to produce methane while methanobacterium was hydrogen nutritional methanogens which could produce methane by reducing co2 with h2 and formic acid methanosarcina could use several substrates including acetic acid h2 co2 and methylated compound after addition of gac nzvi the abundances of syntrophomonas and syntrophus typical hydrogen producing acetogenic bacteria using butyric acid would increase resulting in accumulation of acetic acid which would promote the growth of methanosaeta and then consumed more acetic acid this phenomenon was consistent with the monitoring results of egsb effluent moreover the total contents of methanogens after gac nzvi addition were also increased from 74 7 to 81 74 resulting in more methane production which was also in accord with the gas production data in egsb 4 conclusions the addition of nano mediators is a feasible technology to improve pollutant removal and methane production in anaerobic process after gac nzvi injection cod removal increased by 12 1 tetracycline and sulfate removal almost kept constant while biogas output and methane content increased by 21 2 and 26 9 respectively gac nzvi prompted the formation of densely packed aggregates and multi layer structure in sludge and increased the eps content surrounded microbes and the conductivities of sludge which played a significant role in enhancing the interspecies mass and electron transfer 94 6 of fe accumulated in sludge during 34 d operation with the sludge content of 20 43 gac nzvi evidently changed the bacterial and methanogenic community structure with the treponema and methanosaeta as the dominant strains in the gac nzvi dosed egsb reactor the results would provide the theoretical basis and technological supports for enhancing the treatment efficiency and energy

19648,ciprofloxacin cip a fluoroquinolone antibiotic removal was examined for the first time in an anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria srb sludge system about 28 0 of cip was biodegraded by srb sludge when the influent cip concentration was 5000 μg l some srb genera with high tolerance to cip i e desulfobacter were enriched at cip concentration of 5000 μg l the changes in antibiotic resistance genes args of srb sludge coupled with cip biodegradation intermediates were used to understand the mechanism of cip biodegradation for the first time the percentage of efflux pump genes associated with args increased while the percentage of fluoroquinolone resistance genes that inhibit the dna copy of bacteria decreased during prolonged exposure to cip it implies that some intracellular cip was extruded into extracellular environment of microbial cells via efflux pump genes to reduce fluoroquinolone resistance genes accumulation caused by exposure to cip additionally the degradation products and the possible pathways of cip biodegradation were also examined using the new method developed in this study the results suggest that cip was biodegraded intracellularly via desethylation reaction in piperazinyl ring and hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by cytochrome p450 enzymes this study provides an insight into the mechanism and pathways of cip biodegradation by srb sludge and opens up a new opportunity for the treatment of cip containing wastewater using sulfur mediated biological process graphical abstract image 1 keywords biodegradation pathways ciprofloxacin sulfate reducing bacteria srb antibiotics antibiotic resistance genes args 1 introduction ciprofloxacin cip is an extensively used broad spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic and is characterized by its slow biodegradability and high potential of disseminating antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment heeb et al 2011 janecko et al 2016 about 5340 metric tons of cip was used in china in 2013 which was the second highest among all the fluoroquinolone antibiotics prescribed in china zhang et al 2015 and thus has been selected as a model antibiotic in this study cip and associated args have been frequently detected in the aquatic environments including groundwater river drinking water and effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants johnson et al 2015 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 senta et al 2013 cip and associated args have drawn a widespread public health concern in recent years gonzález pleiter et al 2013 golet et al 2003 wastewater treatment plant as an important source and sink of antibiotics plays an important role in antibiotics removal suárez et al 2008 moreover wastewater treatment plants also become the source of args due to exposure of microbes to high concentration of antibiotics in the wastewater guo et al 2017 recent studies have shown that args are also associated with the degradation of antibiotics in microbial cells wright 2005 for example fluoroquinolone antibiotics can be extruded into the extracellular environment by microbe via efflux pump genes associated with args i e mexab oprm poole 2000 and cip can also be inactivated via n acetylation in its piperazinyl amine by inactivation enzymes encoded by aac 6 ib cr gene park et al 2006 in recent years there have been significant research efforts on antibiotics removal in biological processes especially conventional activated sludge process ashfaq et al 2017 tran et al 2016 although widely adopted conventional activated sludge process has some drawbacks such as high energy consumption excess sludge production and lower efficiency in antibiotics removal rivera utrilla et al 2013 watkinson et al 2007 leung et al 2012 thus there is a need to explore an energy efficient sustainable biological process for simultaneous removal of organic matter nutrients and antibiotics one of such emerging biological processes is a sulfur mediated srb system has attracted significant research attention due to effective organics removal less biological sludge production and energy consumption lu et al 2012 wu et al 2016 the srb system has also been employed to treat sulfate laden pharmaceutical wastewaters which showed high tolerance of srb against pharmaceutical compounds chelliapan and sallis 2015 jia et al 2017 reported that sulfamethoxazole smx could be effectively adsorbed and biodegraded by srb sludge system thereby opening up a potential of new srb based biological process for antibiotics removal in biological wastewater treatment process adsorption plays a critical role in cip removal from aqueous phase polesel et al 2015 cip was mainly removed by rapid adsorption onto the activated sludge over 90 in 15 min at initial cip concentration of 100 μg l li and zhang 2010 however adsorption process merely transfers cip from aqueous phase to adsorbents such as microbial sludge without biodegradation or biotransformation thus there exists a potential risk of cip release into the environment several studies reported that cip can be degraded by some fungi via n acetylation desethylene n acetylation and or n formylation reactions parshikov et al 2001 catalyzed by functional enzymes for instance the acetylation enzymes can inactivate cip via n acetylation and the cytochrome p450 enzymes play a key role on the metabolism of cip wetzstein et al 1999 meunier et al 2004 but there are very limited studies on the biodegradation of cip in biological wastewater treatment systems moreover no studies have so far examined the cip biodegradation mechanism and pathways especially in srb sludge system and the roles args and enzymes such as acetylation enzymes and cytochrome p450 enzymes play on cip removal thus the overarching goal of this study was to investigate the degradation mechanism of cip in an anaerobic srb sludge system we examined cip removal and biodegradation and args changes in the srb sludge system using a sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb reactor during long term operation of 285 days and we elucidated the cip degradation of mechanism in the srb sludge system based on changes in args and inhibition batch test of cytochrome p450 enzymes coupled with cip degradation intermediates the biodegradation intermediates were examined by a liquid chromatography equipped with a high resolution time of flight mass spectrometer lc tof ms ms to identify the possible biodegradation pathways of cip in srb sludge system this research shows the potential of sulfur mediated biological process for the treatment of wastewater containing cip or other fluoroquinolone antibiotics 2 materials and methods 2 1 sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb reactor and sample collection a lab scale sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb reactor with working volume of 1 08 l fig s1 in supplementary information si was inoculated with 650 ml of anaerobic sludge 14 0 0 4 g l suspended solids ss taken from the shatin sewage treatment works in hong kong and acclimated with synthetic wastewater table s2 in si the srusb reactor was continuously operated at an influent flow rate of 4 3 l d and a hydraulic retention time hrt of about 6 h for 285 days at different stages at 25 0 5 c the liquid up flow velocity was maintained at 0 56 m hr by controlling the internal recirculation rate to 5 times of the influent flow rate 4 3 l d the solids retention time srt of the srusb reactor was maintained at about 25 days during 285 days of operation by regularly wasting the excess sludge the average concentration of volatile suspended solids vss and vss ss ratio in the srusb reactor were about 5 9 0 3 g l and 0 7 0 01 respectively during 285 days of operation the influent ph was maintained at 7 0 1 0 with addition of 0 1 mm hcl naoh solution using a ph controller mettler toledo oh usa the srusb reactor was fed with the same synthetic wastewater throughout the operation except with the addition of cip cip concentration of 0 μg l in stage 1 day 1 62 cip concentration of 1000 8 2 μg l in stage 2 day 63 137 cip concentration of 3000 11 5 μg l in stage 3 day 138 213 and cip concentration of 5000 7 9 μg l in stage 4 day 214 285 the srusb reactor was operated for nearly 75 days in each stage to collect enough data during steady state operation to evaluate the potential application of the srb sludge system for removal of cip from pharmaceutical and hospital wastewaters the concentration range of cip chosen in this study was between the pharmaceutical and the hospital wastewaters 100 14 000 μg l fick et al 2009 lindberg et al 2004 during the experimental period srb sludge samples were collected for dna extraction in triplicate from the srusb reactor at the end of each stage i e on day 62 stage 1 on day 137 stage 2 on day 213 stage 3 and on day 285 stage 4 the feeding pump was temporarily shut down and the srusb reactor contents were well mixed with glass stirrer before collecting the sludge samples all sludge samples total of 12 were collected and stored immediately at 80 c until dna extraction was carried out as discussed in the later section the influent and effluent samples from srusb reactor were collected on alternate days and analyzed for sulfate thiosulfate sulfite total dissolved sulfide and total organic carbon toc as discussed in jia et al 2017 the effluent ph was also measured regularly using a ph controller the mixed sludges samples totally three parallel samples 10 ml for each were collected weekly from srusb reactor for analyzing cip concentration in sludge data shown in fig 1 following the same procedure with sludge sampling for dna extraction the cip in aqueous phase influent and effluent and sludge samples was determined regularly by an ultra performance liquid chromatography with a dad detector uplc dionex ultimate 3000 ca usa see page s4 in si for more details the cip removal efficiency and removal rate as well as cip adsorption by sludge and biodegradation at different stages were determined see pages s5 in si for details 2 2 batch experiments a series of batch tests were conducted to examine the roles of cytochrome p450 enzymes on cip degradation in srb sludge system the batch experiments include four groups with three parallel serum bottles in each group total of twelve serum bottles each with working volume of 500 ml detailed experiments design as shown in table 1 the group i was designed as control test to examine the possible hydrolysis and photodegradation of cip compared to groups iii without 0 1 nan3 the group ii was to examine the adsorption of cip by srb sludge the group iv was to evaluate the possible role of cytochrome p450 enzymes in cip degradation by srb sludge with comparison to group iii without cytochrome p450 enzymes inhibitor or 0 1 nan3 each serum bottle in four groups was purged with nitrogen gas 99 9 purity for 30 min to establish anaerobic condition and then tightly sealed all serum bottles were placed in a magnetic stirring plate ika rct germany at 200 rpm and temperature of 25 c for a week the srb sludge used in batch studies in groups ii iii and iv was taken from the srusb reactor at the end of stage 4 used until no residual cip was detected on sample extracted from the srb sludge data not shown and then washed with synthetic wastewater composition shown in table s2 in si for three times between washing steps centrifugation 1793 g was used to separate the sludge pellets from the mixed liquor the mixed liquor samples in each serum bottle were regularly collected for determining the cip in aqueous phase and in srb sludge by uplc see page s4 in si for more details the biodegradation efficiency and rate of cip removal by srb sludge in batch experiments were determined see page s5 in si for more details 2 3 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing the triplicate sludge samples collected in each stage were centrifuged separately to obtain 200 mg pellets each sample i e pellet was then subjected to dna extraction using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio ca usa dna concentration and purity were determined by microspectrophotometry nanodrop nd 1000 nanodrop technologies wilmington de usa 16s rrna genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr using primers 515f and 926r targeting the v4 and v5 hypervariable regions quince et al 2011 and then pcr products were sequenced by illumina miseq platform illumina inc san diego ca usa raw miseq sequencing data were processed using the mothur software package v 1 25 1 schloss et al 2009 to generate microbial community profiles of srb sludge samples collected in each stage these data were analyzed by taking the average of the triplicates for metagenomic sequencing the triplicate dna samples obtained in each stage were mixed thoroughly approximately 2 μg of dna from each mixed dna sample was used for library construction and high throughput sequencing by illumina hiseq2500 pe250 platform illumina inc san diego ca usa it generated about 10 gbp giga base pairs of metagenomic data for each dna sample extracted from the mixture of triplicate samples raw sequencing data was deposited in the genbank see table s3 in si for accession number 2 4 bioinformatics and statistical analysis the raw reads 250 bp base pairs in length of each metagenomic data set were first trimmed to discard low quality reads that contained ambiguous nucleotides or a quality score lower than 20 using a customized python script meanwhile trimmed clean reads of each sample were searched for args against the antibiotic resistance database ardb liu and pop 2008 and the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card using blastx altschul et al 1997 with 1 10 5 of e value minot et al 2011 a sequence was annotated as an arg like fragment if its best blastx hit in the ardb had 90 amino acids identity and the alignment length was 25 amino acids kristiansson et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 yang et al 2013 the sequences annotated as arg like fragments were sorted into different types and subtypes of args using a customized script yang et al 2013 statistical analyses were carried out to examine the significant difference statistically in results among samples obtained from the four stages multiple comparisons were based on one way analysis of variance anova in spss 16 0 ibm armonk ny least significant difference lsd p 0 05 test was used for comparisons between treatment means principal coordinate analysis pcoa was performed to visualize the differences in microbial communities among samples using the correlation matrix hierarchical cluster analysis hca was also carried out based on the abundances of genera the portion of types or subtypes of args like sequences in total args like sequences and total metagenomic sequences were defined as percentage and abundance ppm the unit ppm represents one read in one million reads respectively yang et al 2013 all analyses on the distribution and variation of args were performed based on the percentage and abundances of the args 2 5 identification of biodegradation products an effective procedure for determining cip biodegradation products was developed using an lc tof ms ms a high resolution time of flight mass spectrometer equipped with liquid chromatography triple tof

ultra pure water with 0 1 formic acid the gradient was as follows 90 of b within 1 min decreasing from 90 to 10 of b within 19 min continuing from 10 to 90 of b within 4 min constant 90 of b for 2 min full scan was used in positive and negative ionization modes to determine any biodegradation products selected ion recording sir mode was applied subsequently to provide a total chromatographic profile of these putative biodegradation products to extract the ms ms spectra for peaks identified in the last step collision energy ce was individually tuned and optimized within the range of 10 45 ev with respect to the response intensity of the total ion chromatograms tic 3 results and discussion 3 1 cip removal in anaerobic srb sludge system the srusb reactor was continuously operated for 285 days in four stages to evaluate the cip removal in srb sludge system under different cip concentrations the toc removal efficiency was over 80 and about 70 of the influent sulfate was reduced into dissolved sulfide and no sulfur intermediates e g sulfite thiosulfate and elemental sulfur were detected throughout the reactor operation table s4 in si compared to stage 1 without cip addition the toc removal and sulfate reduction efficiency in stages 2 3 and 4 influent cip concentrations of 1000 8 2 3000 11 5 and 5000 7 9 μg l respectively improved by 6 2 0 7 p 0 05 and 9 1 2 4 p 0 05 respectively thereby suggesting that high cip concentrations did not inhibit the srb the results indicated that the srb in srusb reactor showed high tolerance to the high cip concentrations during the long term operation cip concentrations in aqueous and solid phases of the srusb reactor were shown in fig 1a and the cip removal efficiency and specific removal rate in stages 2 3 and 4 were shown in fig 1b the batch experiments showed almost no cip removal via hydrolysis and photodegradation during the experiment see fig s2 in si thus the removal of cip from aqueous phase occurred through a combination of biosorption and biodegradation processes and the cip biodegradation was fairly stable in each stage stages 2 3 and 4 however both the cip removal efficiency and rate via biodegradation showed an increasing trend with increasing influent cip concentrations 12 9 1 7 61 0 3 0 μg g ss d in stage 2 19 5 1 7 266 2 9 1 μg g ss d in stage 3 28 0 1 3 637 3 7 6 μg g ss d in stage 4 a few studies reported that cip was predominantly removed via adsorption in biological wastewater treatment process polesel et al 2015 jia et al 2012 however there have been very limited studies on biodegradation of cip in biological wastewater treatment process li and zhang 2010 found that 32 2 of cip 6 3 μg g ss d at an initial cip of 100 μg l was biodegraded after 48 h of incubation in the mixed liquor obtained from the aeration tank of a biological wastewater treatment plant treating saline sewage dorival garcía et al 2013 investigated cip biodegradation using aerobic sludge nitrifying sludge and anoxic sludge via a series of batch experiments operating for 100 h at an initial cip concentration of 500 μg l the respective removal efficiencies and rates were 43 8 and 75 1 μg g ss d aerobic sludge 50 0 and 85 7 μg g ss d nitrifying sludge and 2 0 and 3 4 μg g ss d anoxic sludge in this study it is apparent that the srb sludge was highly effective in biodegradation of cip with degradation rate of 637 3 μg g ss d at concentration as high as 5000 μg l in the srusb reactor in order to explore the degradation mechanism of cip in srb sludge system the variation in microbial communities and args in srb sludge samples during prolonged exposure to cip were examined as discussed in the following section 3 2 changes in srb communities at different cip concentrations the microbial communities in the srusb reactor were characterized based on the 16s rrna sequences generated by high throughput sequencing miseq the microbial communities in the srb sludge samples obtained at the end of each stage were markedly different based on the pcoa that visualized the differences in microbial communities among sludge samples using the correlation matrix see fig s3 in si it is apparent that the microbial community in sludge sample changed significantly after exposure to cip i e the data point for stage 1 was far from other data points see fig s3 in si and cip shaped the microbial community composition in the srusb reactor as the data points for stage 3 3000 μg l of influent cip and stage 4 5000 μg l of influent cip were very close the microbial communities at phylum and genus level were shown in fig s4 in si the srb genera were identified by comparing the analyzing results of high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene in sludge sample of srusb reactor with the mostly reported srb genera rabus et al 2006 the percentage of srb species the portion of otus of srb in total otus remained unchanged in all stages p 0 05 however the percentage of srb abundance the portion of srb reads in total reads increased significantly from 16 7 stage 1 to 50 8 stage 4 p 0 05 as shown in fig 2 a this finding was also in consistent with higher toc removal and sulfate reduction as discussed earlier due to an increase in relative abundance of srb at higher cip concentration based on the pearson bivariate correlation analysis guo et al 2017 the relative abundance of srb significantly correlated with influent cip concentration r 0 994 p 0 01 indicating cip addition shaped the microbial community composition of srb sludge in srusb reactor additionally the genera of srb could be assembled into 2 clusters during long time exposure to high cip concentration based on the hca analysis as shown in fig 2b cluster 1 including desulfospira desulfomonile desulfurispora desulfatibacillum desulfobacula and other 15 srb genera obviously decreased from stage 1 to stage 4 fig 2b on contrary the cluster 2 including desulfobacter and 8 other srb genera increased from stage 1 to stage 4 fig 2b the results showed that the prolonged cip exposure triggered a shift in srb microbial community from cluster 1 to cluster 2 desulfobacter dominated assemblage and indicates a greater tolerance of desulfobacter dominated assemblages than srb genera in cluster 1 against cip similar findings were also reported by cordova kreylos and scow 2007 that cip had no apparent negative effects on desulfobacter in microbial community of saline marsh sediments there are however very limited studies on cip degradation by srb 3 3 variation of args in the srb sludge system total of 15 types of args including 126 subtypes were identified in the srb sludge samples fig 3 and table s6 in si the total abundance of args in the srb sludge samples increased from 58 0 ppm the portion of types or subtypes of args like sequences in total metagenomic sequences were defined as abundance using the unit ppm one read in one million reads in stage 1 124 0 ppm in stage 4 table s7 in si it is apparent that the introduction of increasing concentration of cip not only stimulated the abundance of args in the srb sludge from the srusb reactor but also contributed to the variation of args types as shown in fig 3 the total percentages of four types of args namely aminoglycoside macrolide sulfonamide and multidrug increased from 5 5 to 19 1 3 4 13 3 8 7 12 5 and 3 4 6 0 respectively with increasing influent cip concentrations from 0 stage 1 1000 8 2 stage 2 3000 11 5 stage 3 to 5000 7 9 μg l stage 4 fig s5 in si on contrary the percentage of beta lactam and fluoroquinolone resistance genes decreased from 20 7 to 12 3 and 6 2 2 2 respectively with increasing influent cip concentrations from 0 to 5000 μg l in stage 1 to stage 4 fig s5 in si it is apparent that the changes in args were related to the prolonged exposure to higher cip stress from 1000 to 5000 μg l which may have promoted the dissemination of args via the horizontal transfer among diverse microbes and or vertical transfer from the previous generation in srb sludge system hu et al 2017 tandukar et al 2013 there are generally four microbial resistance mechanisms against the antibiotics walsh 2000 including efflux pump that thrusts the antibiotics into the extracellular environment antibiotics inactivation by the change in the chemical structure via some inactivation enzymes target bypass genes confer antibiotic resistance via molecular bypass and target modification a reprogramming or camouflaging of the target in the resistance bacteria in this study the percentages of four mechanisms were calculated using the abundance of args belonging to each mechanism divided by the total abundance of args as shown in fig 4 a the dominant resistance mechanism of antibiotics observed in original sample stage 1 was target modification mechanism without cip 57 6 however the percentages of efflux pumps and inactivation args increased and the target modification args decreased in srb sludge samples from stage 1 to stage 4 the percentage of efflux pump genes increased from 6 1 stage 1 to 10 7 stage 4 suggesting that bacteria could efflux pump the toxic antibiotic for self defense webber and piddock 2003 poole 2000 the percentage of inactivation genes encoding sulfonamide macrolide and aminoglycoside inactivation enzymes increased from 40 0 stage 1 to 45 7 stage 4 however it is important to point out that the inactivation genes aac 6 ib cr gene encoding an inactivation enzyme to transform cip into acetylation cip robicsek et al 2006 were not detected in all four stages in this study the variation in inactivation and target modification of args is governed by many factors such as dissemination of args among microbial population ochman et al 2000 and or synergistic abduction of multiple args davies 1994 the percentage of fluoroquinolone resistance genes in total args is summarized in fig 4b it showed a decreasing trend in the srb sludge system from 6 2 in stage 1 with no cip addition to 2 2 in stage 4 with influent cip of 5000 μg l total of five subtypes of fluoroquinolone resistance genes such as gyra gyrb parc qnrs2 and mfd were detected in the srb sludge system the gyra gyrb and parc genes encoding enzymes to inhibit dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv of bacteria jacoby 2005 were predominant in all srb sludge samples the decrease in the percentage of fluoroquinolone resistance genes may be due to two reasons 1 some of cip was extruded out of the cell by the efflux pump genes one kind of args to decrease the toxicity caused by cip poole 2000 and 2 some of cip was intracellularly degraded through functional enzymes such as acetylation enzymes and cytochrome p450 enzymes park et al 2006 prieto et al 2011 the aac 6 ib cr gene associated with args encoding an acetylation cip enzyme robicsek et al 2006 was not detected in the srb sludge samples of four stages in this study but the genes encoding cytochrome p450 enzymes kegg orthology ko00980 and ko00982 were observed in the metagenomic data of sludge samples in all four stages the raw sequences were deposited at genbank under the accession numbers of srr600744 srr600747 listed in table s3 in si the role of cytochrome p450 enzymes on cip degradation was further examined through a series of batch tests using 1 aminobenzotriazole as cytochrome p450 enzymes inhibitor in this study see table 1 in si for details the cip biodegradation 23 1 removal efficiency and 118 7 μg g ss d degradation rate by srb sludge in the batch tests group iv with 5 mm of 1 aminobenzotriazole was significantly inhibited compared to that in group iii with no 1 aminobenzotriazole 46 4 removal efficiency and 223 4 μg g ss d degradation rate see fig s6 in si for more details thus it is apparent that cytochrome p450 enzymes played an important role in cip degradation to further examine the cip biodegradation pathways in srb sludge system the metabolites degradation intermediates of cip degradation were identified as discussed in the following section 3 4 cip biodegradation products and pathways the cip biodegradation products intermediates in the srb sludge system were examined using a lc tof ms ms after solid phase extraction see page s4 in si for details total of six transformation products tp were detected in the srb sludge system during both srusb operation and batch experiments details of ms ms fragments molecular structures of intermediates are given in table s9 in si and the total ion chromatogram of lc tof ms ms is shown in fig s7 in si furthermore the four possible biodegradation pathways of cip by the srb sludge were also proposed as elucidated in fig 5 in pathway a the tp1 was generated by removing c2h2 at the piperazinyl substituent of cip via desethylation and subsequently transformed into tp2 via loss of a c2h5n fragment of tp1 fig 5 although tp1 and tp2 were previously identified in the biodegradation of cip by some fungi prieto et al 2011 wetzstein et al 2006 čvančarová et al 2015 they were also detected as the biodegradation products intermediates of cip in sulfur mediated biological process for the first time in this study in pathway b tp3 was formed via hydroxylation in position c 5 of cip and then transformed into tp4 again via hydroxylation in position c 7 of cip by replacing the piperazinyl group of tp3 see table s9 in si in pathways c and d tp5 and tp6 were produced by replacing fluorine in position c 6 and carboxyl group in position c 3 of cip via hydroxylation respectively fig 5 the biodegradation intermediate of cip acetylation cip produced via acetylation of nh group in piperazine ring catalyzed by an inactivation enzyme encoded by aac 6 ib cr gene was not detected by lc tof ms ms analysis in this study this finding was in consistent with the above analysis of args in the srb sludge system in which no aac 6 ib cr gene was detected four pathways were assigned to two different reactions 1 decomposition of piperazinyl substituent pathway a 2 hydroxylation pathways b c and d pathways a and b were reported in an in vivo cip biodegradation experiment using a white rot fungus trametes versicolor where cytochrome p450 enzymes catalyzed the epoxidation of c c double bonds and subsequent aromatic hydroxylation prieto et al 2011 and in this study the genes encoding cytochrome p450 enzymes kegg orthology ko00980 and ko00982 were observed by the metagenomic analysis of sludge samples in all four stages the raw sequences were deposited at genbank with the accession numbers of srr600744 srr600747 listed in table s3 in si the inhibition batch test on cytochrome p450 enzymes further confirmed that the cytochrome p450 enzymes played a significant role in cip biodegradation by srb sludge see figs s6c and d in si thus it is reasonable to believe that cytochrome p450 enzymes catalyzed the breakdown of piperazinyl substituent pathway a and or the hydroxylation pathways b c and d in this study see fig 5 the proposed cip biodegradation mechanism in the anaerobic srb sludge system is presented in fig 6 1 srb cells pumped out cip to extracellular environment with efflux pump genes to relief the intracellular inhibition of cip and 2 some intracellular cip was predominantly transformed into six intermediates via decomposition of piperazinyl substituent pathway a and hydroxylation pathways b c and d catalyzed by intracellular cytochrome p450 enzymes based on pearson bivariate correlation analysis guo et al 2017 the cip biodegradation significantly correlated with the presence of srb r 0 998 p 0 01 so deeper studies need to be conducted to better understand the metabolic pathways of cip degradation at genetic and enzymatic levels using the dominant isolates of srb sludge via metagenomics and transcriptomics 4 conclusion the removal and biodegradation of cip in an anaerobic srb sludge system during long term operation was examined for the first time the results suggested that cip was effectively biodegraded 61 0 637 3 μg g ss d by the srb sludge system with removal efficiency of nearly 28 0 thus the proposed energy efficient sulfur mediated biological process could provide a new avenue for treating pharmaceutical and hospital wastewaters containing cip or other fluoroquinolone antibiotics in srb sludge system some srb genera such as desulfobacter desulfitibacter and desulfovirga showed high tolerance to cip additionally the changes in args of srb sludge coupled with chemical intermediates degradation metabolites were can be used to better understand the mechanism of cip degradation in sulfur based biological process such as sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated sani which is currently being examined for process scale up in

19648,ciprofloxacin cip a fluoroquinolone antibiotic removal was examined for the first time in an anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria srb sludge system about 28 0 of cip was biodegraded by srb sludge when the influent cip concentration was 5000 μg l some srb genera with high tolerance to cip i e desulfobacter were enriched at cip concentration of 5000 μg l the changes in antibiotic resistance genes args of srb sludge coupled with cip biodegradation intermediates were used to understand the mechanism of cip biodegradation for the first time the percentage of efflux pump genes associated with args increased while the percentage of fluoroquinolone resistance genes that inhibit the dna copy of bacteria decreased during prolonged exposure to cip it implies that some intracellular cip was extruded into extracellular environment of microbial cells via efflux pump genes to reduce fluoroquinolone resistance genes accumulation caused by exposure to cip additionally the degradation products and the possible pathways of cip biodegradation were also examined using the new method developed in this study the results suggest that cip was biodegraded intracellularly via desethylation reaction in piperazinyl ring and hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by cytochrome p450 enzymes this study provides an insight into the mechanism and pathways of cip biodegradation by srb sludge and opens up a new opportunity for the treatment of cip containing wastewater using sulfur mediated biological process graphical abstract image 1 keywords biodegradation pathways ciprofloxacin sulfate reducing bacteria srb antibiotics antibiotic resistance genes args 1 introduction ciprofloxacin cip is an extensively used broad spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic and is characterized by its slow biodegradability and high potential of disseminating antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment heeb et al 2011 janecko et al 2016 about 5340 metric tons of cip was used in china in 2013 which was the second highest among all the fluoroquinolone antibiotics prescribed in china zhang et al 2015 and thus has been selected as a model antibiotic in this study cip and associated args have been frequently detected in the aquatic environments including groundwater river drinking water and effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants johnson et al 2015 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 senta et al 2013 cip and associated args have drawn a widespread public health concern in recent years gonzález pleiter et al 2013 golet et al 2003 wastewater treatment plant as an important source and sink of antibiotics plays an important role in antibiotics removal suárez et al 2008 moreover wastewater treatment plants also become the source of args due to exposure of microbes to high concentration of antibiotics in the wastewater guo et al 2017 recent studies have shown that args are also associated with the degradation of antibiotics in microbial cells wright 2005 for example fluoroquinolone antibiotics can be extruded into the extracellular environment by microbe via efflux pump genes associated with args i e mexab oprm poole 2000 and cip can also be inactivated via n acetylation in its piperazinyl amine by inactivation enzymes encoded by aac 6 ib cr gene park et al 2006 in recent years there have been significant research efforts on antibiotics removal in biological processes especially conventional activated sludge process ashfaq et al 2017 tran et al 2016 although widely adopted conventional activated sludge process has some drawbacks such as high energy consumption excess sludge production and lower efficiency in antibiotics removal rivera utrilla et al 2013 watkinson et al 2007 leung et al 2012 thus there is a need to explore an energy efficient sustainable biological process for simultaneous removal of organic matter nutrients and antibiotics one of such emerging biological processes is a sulfur mediated srb system has attracted significant research attention due to effective organics removal less biological sludge production and energy consumption lu et al 2012 wu et al 2016 the srb system has also been employed to treat sulfate laden pharmaceutical wastewaters which showed high tolerance of srb against pharmaceutical compounds chelliapan and sallis 2015 jia et al 2017 reported that sulfamethoxazole smx could be effectively adsorbed and biodegraded by srb sludge system thereby opening up a potential of new srb based biological process for antibiotics removal in biological wastewater treatment process adsorption plays a critical role in cip removal from aqueous phase polesel et al 2015 cip was mainly removed by rapid adsorption onto the activated sludge over 90 in 15 min at initial cip concentration of 100 μg l li and zhang 2010 however adsorption process merely transfers cip from aqueous phase to adsorbents such as microbial sludge without biodegradation or biotransformation thus there exists a potential risk of cip release into the environment several studies reported that cip can be degraded by some fungi via n acetylation desethylene n acetylation and or n formylation reactions parshikov et al 2001 catalyzed by functional enzymes for instance the acetylation enzymes can inactivate cip via n acetylation and the cytochrome p450 enzymes play a key role on the metabolism of cip wetzstein et al 1999 meunier et al 2004 but there are very limited studies on the biodegradation of cip in biological wastewater treatment systems moreover no studies have so far examined the cip biodegradation mechanism and pathways especially in srb sludge system and the roles args and enzymes such as acetylation enzymes and cytochrome p450 enzymes play on cip removal thus the overarching goal of this study was to investigate the degradation mechanism of cip in an anaerobic srb sludge system we examined cip removal and biodegradation and args changes in the srb sludge system using a sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb reactor during long term operation of 285 days and we elucidated the cip degradation of mechanism in the srb sludge system based on changes in args and inhibition batch test of cytochrome p450 enzymes coupled with cip degradation intermediates the biodegradation intermediates were examined by a liquid chromatography equipped with a high resolution time of flight mass spectrometer lc tof ms ms to identify the possible biodegradation pathways of cip in srb sludge system this research shows the potential of sulfur mediated biological process for the treatment of wastewater containing cip or other fluoroquinolone antibiotics 2 materials and methods 2 1 sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb reactor and sample collection a lab scale sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb reactor with working volume of 1 08 l fig s1 in supplementary information si was inoculated with 650 ml of anaerobic sludge 14 0 0 4 g l suspended solids ss taken from the shatin sewage treatment works in hong kong and acclimated with synthetic wastewater table s2 in si the srusb reactor was continuously operated at an influent flow rate of 4 3 l d and a hydraulic retention time hrt of about 6 h for 285 days at different stages at 25 0 5 c the liquid up flow velocity was maintained at 0 56 m hr by controlling the internal recirculation rate to 5 times of the influent flow rate 4 3 l d the solids retention time srt of the srusb reactor was maintained at about 25 days during 285 days of operation by regularly wasting the excess sludge the average concentration of volatile suspended solids vss and vss ss ratio in the srusb reactor were about 5 9 0 3 g l and 0 7 0 01 respectively during 285 days of operation the influent ph was maintained at 7 0 1 0 with addition of 0 1 mm hcl naoh solution using a ph controller mettler toledo oh usa the srusb reactor was fed with the same synthetic wastewater throughout the operation except with the addition of cip cip concentration of 0 μg l in stage 1 day 1 62 cip concentration of 1000 8 2 μg l in stage 2 day 63 137 cip concentration of 3000 11 5 μg l in stage 3 day 138 213 and cip concentration of 5000 7 9 μg l in stage 4 day 214 285 the srusb reactor was operated for nearly 75 days in each stage to collect enough data during steady state operation to evaluate the potential application of the srb sludge system for removal of cip from pharmaceutical and hospital wastewaters the concentration range of cip chosen in this study was between the pharmaceutical and the hospital wastewaters 100 14 000 μg l fick et al 2009 lindberg et al 2004 during the experimental period srb sludge samples were collected for dna extraction in triplicate from the srusb reactor at the end of each stage i e on day 62 stage 1 on day 137 stage 2 on day 213 stage 3 and on day 285 stage 4 the feeding pump was temporarily shut down and the srusb reactor contents were well mixed with glass stirrer before collecting the sludge samples all sludge samples total of 12 were collected and stored immediately at 80 c until dna extraction was carried out as discussed in the later section the influent and effluent samples from srusb reactor were collected on alternate days and analyzed for sulfate thiosulfate sulfite total dissolved sulfide and total organic carbon toc as discussed in jia et al 2017 the effluent ph was also measured regularly using a ph controller the mixed sludges samples totally three parallel samples 10 ml for each were collected weekly from srusb reactor for analyzing cip concentration in sludge data shown in fig 1 following the same procedure with sludge sampling for dna extraction the cip in aqueous phase influent and effluent and sludge samples was determined regularly by an ultra performance liquid chromatography with a dad detector uplc dionex ultimate 3000 ca usa see page s4 in si for more details the cip removal efficiency and removal rate as well as cip adsorption by sludge and biodegradation at different stages were determined see pages s5 in si for details 2 2 batch experiments a series of batch tests were conducted to examine the roles of cytochrome p450 enzymes on cip degradation in srb sludge system the batch experiments include four groups with three parallel serum bottles in each group total of twelve serum bottles each with working volume of 500 ml detailed experiments design as shown in table 1 the group i was designed as control test to examine the possible hydrolysis and photodegradation of cip compared to groups iii without 0 1 nan3 the group ii was to examine the adsorption of cip by srb sludge the group iv was to evaluate the possible role of cytochrome p450 enzymes in cip degradation by srb sludge with comparison to group iii without cytochrome p450 enzymes inhibitor or 0 1 nan3 each serum bottle in four groups was purged with nitrogen gas 99 9 purity for 30 min to establish anaerobic condition and then tightly sealed all serum bottles were placed in a magnetic stirring plate ika rct germany at 200 rpm and temperature of 25 c for a week the srb sludge used in batch studies in groups ii iii and iv was taken from the srusb reactor at the end of stage 4 used until no residual cip was detected on sample extracted from the srb sludge data not shown and then washed with synthetic wastewater composition shown in table s2 in si for three times between washing steps centrifugation 1793 g was used to separate the sludge pellets from the mixed liquor the mixed liquor samples in each serum bottle were regularly collected for determining the cip in aqueous phase and in srb sludge by uplc see page s4 in si for more details the biodegradation efficiency and rate of cip removal by srb sludge in batch experiments were determined see page s5 in si for more details 2 3 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing the triplicate sludge samples collected in each stage were centrifuged separately to obtain 200 mg pellets each sample i e pellet was then subjected to dna extraction using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio ca usa dna concentration and purity were determined by microspectrophotometry nanodrop nd 1000 nanodrop technologies wilmington de usa 16s rrna genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr using primers 515f and 926r targeting the v4 and v5 hypervariable regions quince et al 2011 and then pcr products were sequenced by illumina miseq platform illumina inc san diego ca usa raw miseq sequencing data were processed using the mothur software package v 1 25 1 schloss et al 2009 to generate microbial community profiles of srb sludge samples collected in each stage these data were analyzed by taking the average of the triplicates for metagenomic sequencing the triplicate dna samples obtained in each stage were mixed thoroughly approximately 2 μg of dna from each mixed dna sample was used for library construction and high throughput sequencing by illumina hiseq2500 pe250 platform illumina inc san diego ca usa it generated about 10 gbp giga base pairs of metagenomic data for each dna sample extracted from the mixture of triplicate samples raw sequencing data was deposited in the genbank see table s3 in si for accession number 2 4 bioinformatics and statistical analysis the raw reads 250 bp base pairs in length of each metagenomic data set were first trimmed to discard low quality reads that contained ambiguous nucleotides or a quality score lower than 20 using a customized python script meanwhile trimmed clean reads of each sample were searched for args against the antibiotic resistance database ardb liu and pop 2008 and the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card using blastx altschul et al 1997 with 1 10 5 of e value minot et al 2011 a sequence was annotated as an arg like fragment if its best blastx hit in the ardb had 90 amino acids identity and the alignment length was 25 amino acids kristiansson et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 yang et al 2013 the sequences annotated as arg like fragments were sorted into different types and subtypes of args using a customized script yang et al 2013 statistical analyses were carried out to examine the significant difference statistically in results among samples obtained from the four stages multiple comparisons were based on one way analysis of variance anova in spss 16 0 ibm armonk ny least significant difference lsd p 0 05 test was used for comparisons between treatment means principal coordinate analysis pcoa was performed to visualize the differences in microbial communities among samples using the correlation matrix hierarchical cluster analysis hca was also carried out based on the abundances of genera the portion of types or subtypes of args like sequences in total args like sequences and total metagenomic sequences were defined as percentage and abundance ppm the unit ppm represents one read in one million reads respectively yang et al 2013 all analyses on the distribution and variation of args were performed based on the percentage and abundances of the args 2 5 identification of biodegradation products an effective procedure for determining cip biodegradation products was developed using an lc tof ms ms a high resolution time of flight mass spectrometer equipped with liquid chromatography triple tof 5600 ab sciex ma usa separation was achieved using an acclaim120 c18 column 2 1 150 mm 3 μm dionex ca usa with a gradient method 0 3 ml min under two mobile phases phase a acetonitrile and phase b ultra pure water with 0 1 formic acid the gradient was as follows 90 of b within 1 min decreasing from 90 to 10 of b within 19 min continuing from 10 to 90 of b within 4 min constant 90 of b for 2 min full scan was used in positive and negative ionization modes to determine any biodegradation products selected ion recording sir mode was applied subsequently to provide a total chromatographic profile of these putative biodegradation products to extract the ms ms spectra for peaks identified in the last step collision energy ce was individually tuned and optimized within the range of 10 45 ev with respect to the response intensity of the total ion chromatograms tic 3 results and discussion 3 1 cip removal in anaerobic srb sludge system the srusb reactor was continuously operated for 285 days in four stages to evaluate the cip removal in srb sludge system under different cip concentrations the toc removal efficiency was over 80 and about 70 of the influent sulfate was reduced into dissolved sulfide and no sulfur intermediates e g sulfite thiosulfate and elemental sulfur were detected throughout the reactor operation table s4 in si compared to stage 1 without cip addition the toc removal and sulfate reduction efficiency in stages 2 3 and 4 influent cip concentrations of 1000 8 2 3000 11 5 and 5000 7 9 μg l respectively improved by 6 2 0 7 p 0 05 and 9 1 2 4 p 0 05 respectively thereby suggesting that high cip concentrations did not inhibit the srb the results indicated that the srb in srusb reactor showed high tolerance to the high cip concentrations during the long term operation cip concentrations in aqueous and solid phases of the srusb reactor were shown in fig 1a and the cip removal efficiency and specific removal rate in stages 2 3 and 4 were shown in fig 1b the batch experiments showed almost no cip removal via hydrolysis and photodegradation during the experiment see fig s2 in si thus the removal of cip from aqueous phase occurred through a combination of biosorption and biodegradation processes and the cip biodegradation was fairly stable in each stage stages 2 3 and 4 however both the cip removal efficiency and rate via biodegradation showed an increasing trend with increasing influent cip concentrations 12 9 1 7 61 0 3 0 μg g ss d in stage 2 19 5 1 7 266 2 9 1 μg g ss d in stage 3 28 0 1 3 637 3 7 6 μg g ss d in stage 4 a few studies reported that cip was predominantly removed via adsorption in biological wastewater treatment process polesel et al 2015 jia et al 2012 however there have been very limited studies on biodegradation of cip in biological wastewater treatment process li and zhang 2010 found that 32 2 of cip 6 3 μg g ss d at an initial cip of 100 μg l was biodegraded after 48 h of incubation in the mixed liquor obtained from the aeration tank of a biological wastewater treatment plant treating saline sewage dorival garcía et al 2013 investigated cip biodegradation using aerobic sludge nitrifying sludge and anoxic sludge via a series of batch experiments operating for 100 h at an initial cip concentration of 500 μg l the respective removal efficiencies and rates were 43 8 and 75 1 μg g ss d aerobic sludge 50 0 and 85 7 μg g ss d nitrifying sludge and 2 0 and 3 4 μg g ss d anoxic sludge in this study it is apparent that the srb sludge was highly effective in biodegradation of cip with degradation rate of 637 3 μg g ss d at concentration as high as 5000 μg l in the srusb reactor in order to explore the degradation mechanism of cip in srb sludge system the variation in microbial communities and args in srb sludge samples during prolonged exposure to cip were examined as discussed in the following section 3 2 changes in srb communities at different cip concentrations the microbial communities in the srusb reactor were characterized based on the 16s rrna sequences generated by high throughput sequencing miseq the microbial communities in the srb sludge samples obtained at the end of each stage were markedly different based on the pcoa that visualized the differences in microbial communities among sludge samples using the correlation matrix see fig s3 in si it is apparent that the microbial community in sludge sample changed significantly after exposure to cip i e the data point for stage 1 was far from other data points see fig s3 in si and cip shaped the microbial community composition in the srusb reactor as the data points for stage 3 3000 μg l of influent cip and stage 4 5000 μg l of influent cip were very close the microbial communities at phylum and genus level were shown in fig s4 in si the srb genera were identified by comparing the analyzing results of high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene in sludge sample of srusb reactor with the mostly reported srb genera rabus et al 2006 the percentage of srb species the portion of otus of srb in total otus remained unchanged in all stages p 0 05 however the percentage of srb abundance the portion of srb reads in total reads increased significantly from 16 7 stage 1 to 50 8 stage 4 p 0 05 as shown in fig 2 a this finding was also in consistent with higher toc removal and sulfate reduction as discussed earlier due to an increase in relative abundance of srb at higher cip concentration based on the pearson bivariate correlation analysis guo et al 2017 the relative abundance of srb significantly correlated with influent cip concentration r 0 994 p 0 01 indicating cip addition shaped the microbial community composition of srb sludge in srusb reactor additionally the genera of srb could be assembled into 2 clusters during long time exposure to high cip concentration based on the hca analysis as shown in fig 2b cluster 1 including desulfospira desulfomonile desulfurispora desulfatibacillum desulfobacula and other 15 srb genera obviously decreased from stage 1 to stage 4 fig 2b on contrary the cluster 2 including desulfobacter and 8 other srb genera increased from stage 1 to stage 4 fig 2b the results showed that the prolonged cip exposure triggered a shift in srb microbial community from cluster 1 to cluster 2 desulfobacter dominated assemblage and indicates a greater tolerance of desulfobacter dominated assemblages than srb genera in cluster 1 against cip similar findings were also reported by cordova kreylos and scow 2007 that cip had no apparent negative effects on desulfobacter in microbial community of saline marsh sediments there are however very limited studies on cip degradation by srb 3 3 variation of args in the srb sludge system total of 15 types of args including 126 subtypes were identified in the srb sludge samples fig 3 and table s6 in si the total abundance of args in the srb sludge samples increased from 58 0 ppm the portion of types or subtypes of args like sequences in total metagenomic sequences were defined as abundance using the unit ppm one read in one million reads in stage 1 124 0 ppm in stage 4 table s7 in si it is apparent that the introduction of increasing concentration of cip not only stimulated the abundance of args in the srb sludge from the srusb reactor but also contributed to the variation of args types as shown in fig 3 the total percentages of four types of args namely aminoglycoside macrolide sulfonamide and multidrug increased from 5 5 to 19 1 3 4 13 3 8 7 12 5 and 3 4 6 0 respectively with increasing influent cip concentrations from 0 stage 1 1000 8 2 stage 2 3000 11 5 stage 3 to 5000 7 9 μg l stage 4 fig s5 in si on contrary the percentage of beta lactam and fluoroquinolone resistance genes decreased from 20 7 to 12 3 and 6 2 2 2 respectively with increasing influent cip concentrations from 0 to 5000 μg l in stage 1 to stage 4 fig s5 in si it is apparent that the changes in args were related to the prolonged exposure to higher cip stress from 1000 to 5000 μg l which may have promoted the dissemination of args via the horizontal transfer among diverse microbes and or vertical transfer from the previous generation in srb sludge system hu et al 2017 tandukar et al 2013 there are generally four microbial resistance mechanisms against the antibiotics walsh 2000 including efflux pump that thrusts the antibiotics into the extracellular environment antibiotics inactivation by the change in the chemical structure via some inactivation enzymes target bypass genes confer antibiotic resistance via molecular bypass and target modification a reprogramming or camouflaging of the target in the resistance bacteria in this study the percentages of four mechanisms were calculated using the abundance of args belonging to each mechanism divided by the total abundance of args as shown in fig 4 a the dominant resistance mechanism of antibiotics observed in original sample stage 1 was target modification mechanism without cip 57 6 however the percentages of efflux pumps and inactivation args increased and the target modification args decreased in srb sludge samples from stage 1 to stage 4 the percentage of efflux pump genes increased from 6 1 stage 1 to 10 7 stage 4 suggesting that bacteria could efflux pump the toxic antibiotic for self defense webber and piddock 2003 poole 2000 the percentage of inactivation genes encoding sulfonamide macrolide and aminoglycoside inactivation enzymes increased from 40 0 stage 1 to 45 7 stage 4 however it is important to point out that the inactivation genes aac 6 ib cr gene encoding an inactivation enzyme to transform cip into acetylation cip robicsek et al 2006 were not detected in all four stages in this study the variation in inactivation and target modification of args is governed by many factors such as dissemination of args among microbial population ochman et al 2000 and or synergistic abduction of multiple args davies 1994 the percentage of fluoroquinolone resistance genes in total args is summarized in fig 4b it showed a decreasing trend in the srb sludge system from 6 2 in stage 1 with no cip addition to 2 2 in stage 4 with influent cip of 5000 μg l total of five subtypes of fluoroquinolone resistance genes such as gyra gyrb parc qnrs2 and mfd were detected in the srb sludge system the gyra gyrb and parc genes encoding enzymes to inhibit dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv of bacteria jacoby 2005 were predominant in all srb sludge samples the decrease in the percentage of fluoroquinolone resistance genes may be due to two reasons 1 some of cip was extruded out of the cell by the efflux pump genes one kind of args to decrease the toxicity caused by cip poole 2000 and 2 some of cip was intracellularly degraded through functional enzymes such as acetylation enzymes and cytochrome p450 enzymes park et al 2006 prieto et al 2011 the aac 6 ib cr gene associated with args encoding an acetylation cip enzyme robicsek et al 2006 was not detected in the srb sludge samples of four stages in this study but the genes encoding cytochrome p450 enzymes kegg orthology ko00980 and ko00982 were observed in the metagenomic data of sludge samples in all four stages the raw sequences were deposited at genbank under the accession numbers of srr600744 srr600747 listed in table s3 in si the role of cytochrome p450 enzymes on cip degradation was further examined through a series of batch tests using 1 aminobenzotriazole as cytochrome p450 enzymes inhibitor in this study see table 1 in si for details the cip biodegradation 23 1 removal efficiency and 118 7 μg g ss d degradation rate by srb sludge in the batch tests group iv with 5 mm of 1 aminobenzotriazole was significantly inhibited compared to that in group iii with no 1 aminobenzotriazole 46 4 removal efficiency and 223 4 μg g ss d degradation rate see fig s6 in si for more details thus it is apparent that cytochrome p450 enzymes played an important role in cip degradation to further examine the cip biodegradation pathways in srb sludge system the metabolites degradation intermediates of cip degradation were identified as discussed in the following section 3 4 cip biodegradation products and pathways the cip biodegradation products intermediates in the srb sludge system were examined using a lc tof ms ms after solid phase extraction see page s4 in si for details total of six transformation products tp were detected in the srb sludge system during both srusb operation and batch experiments details of ms ms fragments molecular structures of intermediates are given in table s9 in si and the total ion chromatogram of lc tof ms ms is shown in fig s7 in si furthermore the four possible biodegradation pathways of cip by the srb sludge were also proposed as elucidated in fig 5 in pathway a the tp1 was generated by removing c2h2 at the piperazinyl substituent of cip via desethylation and subsequently transformed into tp2 via loss of a c2h5n fragment of tp1 fig 5 although tp1 and tp2 were previously identified in the biodegradation of cip by some fungi prieto et al 2011 wetzstein et al 2006 čvančarová et al 2015 they were also detected as the biodegradation products intermediates of cip in sulfur mediated biological process for the first time in this study in pathway b tp3 was formed via hydroxylation in position c 5 of cip and then transformed into tp4 again via hydroxylation in position c 7 of cip by replacing the piperazinyl group of tp3 see table s9 in si in pathways c and d tp5 and tp6 were produced by replacing fluorine in position c 6 and carboxyl group in position c 3 of cip via hydroxylation respectively fig 5 the biodegradation intermediate of cip acetylation cip produced via acetylation of nh group in piperazine ring catalyzed by an inactivation enzyme encoded by aac 6 ib cr gene was not detected by lc tof ms ms analysis in this study this finding was in consistent with the above analysis of args in the srb sludge system in which no aac 6 ib cr gene was detected four pathways were assigned to two different reactions 1 decomposition of piperazinyl substituent pathway a 2 hydroxylation pathways b c and d pathways a and b were reported in an in vivo cip biodegradation experiment using a white rot fungus trametes versicolor where cytochrome p450 enzymes catalyzed the epoxidation of c c double bonds and subsequent aromatic hydroxylation prieto et al 2011 and in this study the genes encoding cytochrome p450 enzymes kegg orthology ko00980 and ko00982 were observed by the metagenomic analysis of sludge samples in all four stages the raw sequences were deposited at genbank with the accession numbers of srr600744 srr600747 listed in table s3 in si the inhibition batch test on cytochrome p450 enzymes further confirmed that the cytochrome p450 enzymes played a significant role in cip biodegradation by srb sludge see figs s6c and d in si thus it is reasonable to believe that cytochrome p450 enzymes catalyzed the breakdown of piperazinyl substituent pathway a and or the hydroxylation pathways b c and d in this study see fig 5 the proposed cip biodegradation mechanism in the anaerobic srb sludge system is presented in fig 6 1 srb cells pumped out cip to extracellular environment with efflux pump genes to relief the intracellular inhibition of cip and 2 some intracellular cip was predominantly transformed into six intermediates via decomposition of piperazinyl substituent pathway a and hydroxylation pathways b c and d catalyzed by intracellular cytochrome p450 enzymes based on pearson bivariate correlation analysis guo et al 2017 the cip biodegradation significantly correlated with the presence of srb r 0 998 p 0 01 so deeper studies need to be conducted to better understand the metabolic pathways of cip degradation at genetic and enzymatic levels using the dominant isolates of srb sludge via metagenomics and transcriptomics 4 conclusion the removal and biodegradation of cip in an anaerobic srb sludge system during long term operation was examined for the first time the results suggested that cip was effectively biodegraded 61 0 637 3 μg g ss d by the srb sludge system with removal efficiency of nearly 28 0 thus the proposed energy efficient sulfur mediated biological process could provide a new avenue for treating pharmaceutical and hospital wastewaters containing cip or other fluoroquinolone antibiotics in srb sludge system some srb genera such as desulfobacter desulfitibacter and desulfovirga showed high tolerance to cip additionally the changes in args of srb sludge coupled with chemical intermediates degradation metabolites were can be used to better understand the mechanism of cip degradation in sulfur based biological process such as sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated sani which is currently being examined for process scale up in

19649,intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb was realized in a macroporous carrier in which a photocatalyst was present on the outer surface while a biofilm accumulated inside the carrier in icpb photocatalysis products are rapidly biodegraded by a protected biofilm leading to mineralization of the refractory organics such as antibiotics however mineralization in icpb could be compromised if the photocatalysis products remain refractory or are inhibitory to address this we attempted to increase metabolic activity by providing a readily biodegradable co substrate acetate that could act as a source of energy and electrons to improve biotransformation and mineralization of the refractory antibiotic tetracycline tch when we added acetate during icpb of tch tch removal increased by 5 mineralization increased by 20 and almost all photocatalysis products disappeared acetate addition also led to an increase in active biomass an increase in the biomass s respiratory activity and evolution of the microbial community to having more members able to biodegrade photocatalysis and biotransformation intermediates thus providing an easily biodegradable co substrate was an effective means for enhancing tch removal and mineralization with the icpb technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords co substrate photocatalysis biodegradation biotransformation mineralization microbial community 1 introduction the ubiquitous occurrence of antibiotics in aquatic systems has become an environmental concern because it can lead to antibiotic resistant pathogens ma et al 2012 zhang et al 2014a b tetracycline tch is the second most extensively used antibiotic for disease control and enhancing animal growth wang et al 2011b sarmah et al 2006 the treatment of wastewater that contains tch has attracted attention richardson et al 2005 luo et al 2011 but remains an unsolved problem conventional biological processes often fail to treat tch because of its antibiotic properties and poor biodegradability zheng et al 2015 kümmerer 2001 photocatalysis is an efficient advanced oxidation process aop for transforming bio recalcitrant pollutants but it normally results in partial mineralization of tch and accumulation of partially oxidized products yan et al 2016 westerhoff et al 2005 thus biodegradation usually is necessary as a downstream process after photocatalytic degradation of tch li and zhang 2010 ideally the initial photocatalysis step is precisely controlled so that the target organics are transformed only to the stage at which they can be rapidly biodegraded marsolek et al 2008 photocatalysis beyond this point incurs unnecessary costs and can generate products that are poorly biodegradable or inhibitory limiting photocatalytic transformation to this point has proven difficult because photocatalysis is indiscriminate and fast acting yan et al 2016 marsolek et al 2008 a novel approach known as intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb was developed to overcome the difficulties of sequential photocatalysis and biodegradation marsolek et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 li et al 2011 2012a b wen et al 2012 zhou et al 2015 ma et al 2015 in one manifestation of icpb photocatalyst nanoparticles are bound to the outer surface of macroporous carriers that contain a biofilm in their internal macropores photocatalysis generates products at the exterior of the carriers and biodegradable products are consumed rapidly by the interior bacteria living in a biofilm in the interior of the carriers the bacteria are protected from uv light free radicals and the original contaminant such as tch icpb has been demonstrated for many bio recalcitrant and bio inhibitory compounds including phenol dong et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 trichlorophenol marsolek et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 li et al 2011 nitrobenzene yang et al 2015 pyridine zhang et al 2014a b quinoline yan et al 2013 and dyes li et al 2012b icpb not only removed the biorecalcitrant organic but also increased its mineralization recently we used icpb to transform and mineralize tch xiong et al 2017 tch removal was as much as 90 and tch mineralization represented by removal of chemical oxygen demand cod was 65 uplc ms analysis showed that molecules with 2 or 3 benzene rings remained they probably were photocatalysis products that resisted further biological oxidization one strategy for enhancing biodegradation is to provide an easily biodegradable substrate to support a more robust biofilm community marsolek and rittmann 2016 for example a simple organic acid e g oxalate or acetate is added as a co substrate that provides extra electron donor to support more biomass synthesis counteract toxicity effects and accelerate oxygenation reactions müller et al 2013 kim et al 2014 bai et al 2015 can tch mineralization during icpb be enhanced by adding a biodegradable substrate in this work we test the hypothesis that addition of an easily biodegradable electron donor will enhance the icpb biofilm s biodegradation capability when it encounters resistant intermediates we operated icpb reactors for tch treatment with and without acetate addition we evaluated tch removal and mineralization kinetics and also focused on the survival of the biofilms and the resilience of the microbial community the results support the value of adding a readily biodegradable co substrate as a means to improve the removal and mineralization of antibiotics having complex chemical structures 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor configuration experiments on tch degradation were conducted in a plexiglass internal loop airlift driven reactor with a total volume capacity of 540 ml fig s1 provides a schematic the draft tube section of the reactor had a diameter of 40 mm a height of 130 mm and an aeration disc diffuser with a diameter of 40 mm mounted on the bottom the annular section was a tube had an inner diameter of 70 mm and a total height of 180 mm liquid mixture flowed down the annular tube for recycling to the draft tube air was supplied to the internal loop of the reactor by a 35 w aeration pump sobo weifang china that provided an air superficial velocity in the draft tube of 10 mm s corresponding to an aeration rate of 480 g o2 g tch h when illumination was used an led panel 42 w hueler guangdong china with wavelengths ranging from 420 to 700 nm provided an incident light intensity of 5 38 10 5 e l s the porous sponge carriers for the icpb reaction were polyurethane cubes 2 mm on a side and with porosity of 87 and wet density of 0 89 g ml hayi diverse yixing china 2 2 photocatalyst preparation and coating procedure the photocatalyst was nano particulate ag tio2 which responds to visible light xiong et al 2017 titanium tetraisopropoxide ti och ch3 2 4 97 sigma aldrich co llc usa and silver nitrate agno3 sigma aldrich co llc usa were used as precursors of titania and silver man et al 2005 respectively while sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate c6h5na3 2h2o beijing chemical works china was employed as the reducing agent details of the preparation procedure are given in xiong et al 2017 the photocatalyst coating procedure involved a sol gel and evaporation induced self assembly eisa zhou et al 2012 chemical solution deposition and nanostructuring between the nanoparticles and the carrier surface were the main driving forces martínez ferrero et al 2010 2 3 inoculum and biofilm cultivation the carriers were immersed in an activated sludge slurry obtained from the activated sludge process of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in changchun china for 24 h to adsorb microbes subsequently biofilms were cultivated on and in the carriers using an internal circulation fluidized bed with aeration sodium acetate naac feed of 5 mm was the electron donor and carbon source the bioreactor was operated in the dark until chemical oxygen demand cod removal became stable which indicated that the biofilms were mature in terms of accumulation and biodegradation activity details on the bioreactor and cultivation medium are given in zhou et al 2015 and summarized in supplementary information text s1 2 4 experimental protocols icpb was carried out at room temperature 20 c and in two series of 6 batch cycles having cycle times of 10 h for all protocols the volume exchange ratio was 50 v v working volume total volume capacity which was controlled by withdrawing feeding 270 ml effluent influent at the beginning end of each cycle the total volume capacity of the reactor was 540 ml for experiments on the degradation of tch c22h24n2o8 hcl 98 sigma aldrich co llc tch was added to tap water to produce an initial concentration of 30 or 60 mg l a readily biodegradable electron donor sodium acetate naac 3h2o 98 beijing chemical works china was added to produce initial concentrations of 255 or 510 mg l nh4cl and na2hpo4 12h2o were supplied as n and p sources in proportion of the chemical oxygen demand cod n p in a mass ratio of 100 5 1 the two series are denoted icpb 1 and icpb 2 based on not having or having an acetate supplement respectively during icpb photocatalysis and biodegradation occurred simultaneously on and in the sponge carriers described below as they were illuminated the same icpb reactor fig s1 also was operated with carriers having photocatalyst coating but no biofilm these strictly photocatalytic experiments are called pc 1 and pc 2 for without or with a supplementation of acetate respectively likewise the reactor was operated with carriers having a biofilm but no photocatalyst these biodegradation only experiments are labeled b 1 and b 2 again without or with acetate respectively 2 5 analysis of tch and tch degradation products the tch concentration was determined with an agilent 1100 high performance liquid chromatography hplc system equipped with a 4 6 250 mm 5 μm venusil hilic column the

statistical analysis to document the roles of naac co substrate in enhancing tch removal and mineralization we analyzed the data using an independent samples t test p 0 05 indicated significance for all results wallace et al 2016 and all analyses were conducted using the spss software package ibm spss statistic 20 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 fabrication of icpb for tch degradation fig 1 presents sem images that confirm successful icpb when treating tch prior to operating in the icpb mode fig 1a and b biofilm accumulated on the interior and exterior surfaces of the sponge carriers during icpb operation biofilm was densely and uniformly distributed only in the interior pores without and with addition of naac fig 1 c and e in contrast the exterior surfaces fig 1d and f show exposed ag tio2 photocatalyst particles during icpb since most of the bacterial cells had detached due to the photocatalysis induced damage dong et al 2016 characterization of ag tio2 is given in the supplementary information text s5 fig s2 and fig s3 this difference between the interior and exterior surfaces is a primary characteristic of icpb marsolek et al 2008 xiong et al 2017 3 2 enhancing tch removal with naac co substrate fig 2 shows the average tch removal by icpb during cycles 4 6 the icpb reactor had reached steady state performance by the 3rd cycle since photocatalyst had become exposed due to biofilm detachment from the exterior surfaces fig 1d and f tch concentrations for all 6 cycles are given in fig s4 and s5 the small error bars in fig 2 confirm stable steady state performance for cycles 4 6 for both initial tch concentrations 30 and 60 mg l the tch removal efficiency was 10 greater for icpb 1 without naac compared with photocatalysis alone pc 1 i e 90 vs 80 tch removal was enhanced reaching 95 with naac added as a co substrate icpb 2 the enhancement was statistically significant as p values were 0 004 and 0 024 when initial tch concentrations were 30 and 60 mg l respectively the acceleration of tch removal can be attributed to more efficient photocatalysis xiong et al 2017 as shown in fig s6 biodegradation alone did not alter the trend for adsorption of tch thus tch was not biodegradable without or with co substrate compared to icpb 1 photocatalytic free radicals of icpb 2 could more efficiently attack tch itself presumably because the photocatalysis intermediates were more rapidly biodegraded so that they did not compete as much with tch for free radicals 3 3 enhancing tch mineralization with naac co substrate 3 3 1 increased scod removal scod removal caused by adsorption was 30 as shown in fig s7 photocatalysis alone pc 1 had poor mineralization performances represented by scod removal in fig 3 11 6 and 22 8 mg l scod loss when the initial tch concentration was 30 and 60 mg l respectively both corresponding to 35 scod removal similar limits on mineralization by photocatalysis alone is widely reported chen et al 2016 yahiat et al 2011 tch mineralization was increased by icpb and addition of co substrate scod loss for icpb 1 increased to 50 and adding naac co substrate icpb 2 increased scod removal for tch to about 70 by assuming all naac was oxidized even reaching 95 for total scod the improvement to tch mineralization by the addition of naac co substrate was significant with p values of 0 010 and 0 103 for initial tch concentrations 30 and 60 mg l respectively adding acetate as an exogenous electron donor accelerated the biodegradation of the photocatalysis products and ultimately their mineralization by increasing the availability of intracellular electron donor naac stimulated initial oxygenation steps which then led to more mineralization that also increased the availability of intracellular donor for all donor requiring steps bai et al 2015 marsolek and rittmann 2016 the increased mineralization of photocatalysis products supports our understanding that icpb and addition of naac increased the removal rate of tch by minimizing competition for free radical attack 3 3 2 tch degradation pathways fig 4 shows the uplc detected products from photocatalysis along same products for pc 1 and pc 2 icpb 1 and icpb 2 the uplc ms spectra for the identified compounds are shown in fig s8 photocatalysis alone transformed tch to 4 ring products with m z values of 423 433 427 and 426 these correspond to products of hydroxylation bond cleavage loss of nh3 and h2o and demethylization niu et al 2013 he et al 2014 zhu et al 2013 they were detected throughout the pc process and fig 4 presents those that had

19649,intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb was realized in a macroporous carrier in which a photocatalyst was present on the outer surface while a biofilm accumulated inside the carrier in icpb photocatalysis products are rapidly biodegraded by a protected biofilm leading to mineralization of the refractory organics such as antibiotics however mineralization in icpb could be compromised if the photocatalysis products remain refractory or are inhibitory to address this we attempted to increase metabolic activity by providing a readily biodegradable co substrate acetate that could act as a source of energy and electrons to improve biotransformation and mineralization of the refractory antibiotic tetracycline tch when we added acetate during icpb of tch tch removal increased by 5 mineralization increased by 20 and almost all photocatalysis products disappeared acetate addition also led to an increase in active biomass an increase in the biomass s respiratory activity and evolution of the microbial community to having more members able to biodegrade photocatalysis and biotransformation intermediates thus providing an easily biodegradable co substrate was an effective means for enhancing tch removal and mineralization with the icpb technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords co substrate photocatalysis biodegradation biotransformation mineralization microbial community 1 introduction the ubiquitous occurrence of antibiotics in aquatic systems has become an environmental concern because it can lead to antibiotic resistant pathogens ma et al 2012 zhang et al 2014a b tetracycline tch is the second most extensively used antibiotic for disease control and enhancing animal growth wang et al 2011b sarmah et al 2006 the treatment of wastewater that contains tch has attracted attention richardson et al 2005 luo et al 2011 but remains an unsolved problem conventional biological processes often fail to treat tch because of its antibiotic properties and poor biodegradability zheng et al 2015 kümmerer 2001 photocatalysis is an efficient advanced oxidation process aop for transforming bio recalcitrant pollutants but it normally results in partial mineralization of tch and accumulation of partially oxidized products yan et al 2016 westerhoff et al 2005 thus biodegradation usually is necessary as a downstream process after photocatalytic degradation of tch li and zhang 2010 ideally the initial photocatalysis step is precisely controlled so that the target organics are transformed only to the stage at which they can be rapidly biodegraded marsolek et al 2008 photocatalysis beyond this point incurs unnecessary costs and can generate products that are poorly biodegradable or inhibitory limiting photocatalytic transformation to this point has proven difficult because photocatalysis is indiscriminate and fast acting yan et al 2016 marsolek et al 2008 a novel approach known as intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb was developed to overcome the difficulties of sequential photocatalysis and biodegradation marsolek et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 li et al 2011 2012a b wen et al 2012 zhou et al 2015 ma et al 2015 in one manifestation of icpb photocatalyst nanoparticles are bound to the outer surface of macroporous carriers that contain a biofilm in their internal macropores photocatalysis generates products at the exterior of the carriers and biodegradable products are consumed rapidly by the interior bacteria living in a biofilm in the interior of the carriers the bacteria are protected from uv light free radicals and the original contaminant such as tch icpb has been demonstrated for many bio recalcitrant and bio inhibitory compounds including phenol dong et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 trichlorophenol marsolek et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 li et al 2011 nitrobenzene yang et al 2015 pyridine zhang et al 2014a b quinoline yan et al 2013 and dyes li et al 2012b icpb not only removed the biorecalcitrant organic but also increased its mineralization recently we used icpb to transform and mineralize tch xiong et al 2017 tch removal was as much as 90 and tch mineralization represented by removal of chemical oxygen demand cod was 65 uplc ms analysis showed that molecules with 2 or 3 benzene rings remained they probably were photocatalysis products that resisted further biological oxidization one strategy for enhancing biodegradation is to provide an easily biodegradable substrate to support a more robust biofilm community marsolek and rittmann 2016 for example a simple organic acid e g oxalate or acetate is added as a co substrate that provides extra electron donor to support more biomass synthesis counteract toxicity effects and accelerate oxygenation reactions müller et al 2013 kim et al 2014 bai et al 2015 can tch mineralization during icpb be enhanced by adding a biodegradable substrate in this work we test the hypothesis that addition of an easily biodegradable electron donor will enhance the icpb biofilm s biodegradation capability when it encounters resistant intermediates we operated icpb reactors for tch treatment with and without acetate addition we evaluated tch removal and mineralization kinetics and also focused on the survival of the biofilms and the resilience of the microbial community the results support the value of adding a readily biodegradable co substrate as a means to improve the removal and mineralization of antibiotics having complex chemical structures 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor configuration

photocatalyst coating procedure involved a sol gel and evaporation induced self assembly eisa zhou et al 2012 chemical solution deposition and nanostructuring between the nanoparticles and the carrier surface were the main driving forces martínez ferrero et al 2010 2 3 inoculum and biofilm cultivation the carriers were immersed in an activated sludge slurry obtained from the activated sludge process of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in changchun china for 24 h to adsorb microbes subsequently biofilms were cultivated on and in the carriers using an internal circulation fluidized bed with aeration sodium acetate naac feed of 5 mm was the electron donor and carbon source the bioreactor was operated in the dark until chemical oxygen demand cod removal became stable which indicated that the biofilms were mature in terms of accumulation and biodegradation activity details on the bioreactor and cultivation medium are given in zhou et al 2015 and summarized in

statistical analysis to document the roles of naac co substrate in enhancing tch removal and mineralization we analyzed the data using an independent samples t test p 0 05 indicated significance for all results wallace et al 2016 and all analyses were conducted using the spss software package ibm spss statistic 20 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 fabrication of icpb for tch degradation fig 1 presents sem images that confirm successful icpb when treating tch prior to operating in the icpb mode fig 1a and b biofilm accumulated on the interior and exterior surfaces of the sponge carriers during icpb operation biofilm was densely and uniformly distributed only in the interior pores without and with addition of naac fig 1 c and e in contrast the exterior surfaces fig 1d and f show exposed ag tio2 photocatalyst particles during icpb since most of the bacterial cells had detached due to the photocatalysis induced damage dong et al 2016 characterization of ag tio2 is given in the supplementary information text s5 fig s2 and fig s3 this difference between the interior and exterior surfaces is a primary characteristic of icpb marsolek et al 2008 xiong et al 2017 3 2 enhancing tch removal with naac co substrate fig 2 shows the average tch removal by icpb during cycles 4 6 the icpb reactor had reached steady state performance by the 3rd cycle since photocatalyst had become exposed due to biofilm detachment from the exterior surfaces fig 1d and f tch concentrations for all 6 cycles are given in fig s4 and s5 the small error bars in fig 2 confirm stable steady state performance for cycles 4 6 for both initial tch concentrations 30 and 60 mg l the tch removal efficiency was 10 greater for icpb 1 without naac compared with photocatalysis alone pc 1 i e 90 vs 80 tch removal was enhanced reaching 95 with naac added as a co substrate icpb 2 the enhancement was statistically significant as p values were 0 004 and 0 024 when initial tch concentrations were 30 and 60 mg l respectively the acceleration of tch removal can be attributed to more efficient photocatalysis xiong et al 2017 as shown in fig s6 biodegradation alone did not alter the trend for adsorption of tch thus tch was not biodegradable without or with co substrate compared to icpb 1 photocatalytic free radicals of icpb 2 could more efficiently attack tch itself presumably because the photocatalysis intermediates were more rapidly biodegraded so that they did not compete as much with tch for free radicals 3 3 enhancing tch mineralization with naac co substrate 3 3 1 increased scod removal scod removal caused by adsorption was 30 as shown in fig s7 photocatalysis alone pc 1 had poor mineralization performances represented by scod removal in fig 3 11 6 and 22 8 mg l scod loss when the initial tch concentration was 30 and 60 mg l respectively both corresponding to 35 scod removal similar limits on mineralization by photocatalysis alone is widely reported chen et al 2016 yahiat et al 2011 tch mineralization was increased by icpb and addition of co substrate scod loss for icpb 1 increased to 50 and adding naac co substrate icpb 2 increased scod removal for tch to about 70 by assuming all naac was oxidized even reaching 95 for total scod the improvement to tch mineralization by the addition of naac co substrate was significant with p values of 0 010 and 0 103 for initial tch concentrations 30 and 60 mg l respectively adding acetate as an exogenous electron donor accelerated the biodegradation of the photocatalysis products and ultimately their mineralization by increasing the availability of intracellular electron donor naac stimulated initial oxygenation steps which then led to more mineralization that also increased the availability of intracellular donor for all donor requiring steps bai et al 2015 marsolek and rittmann 2016 the increased mineralization of photocatalysis products supports our understanding that icpb and addition of naac increased the removal rate of tch by minimizing competition for free radical attack 3 3 2 tch degradation pathways fig 4 shows the uplc detected products from photocatalysis along same products for pc 1 and pc 2 icpb 1 and icpb 2 the uplc ms spectra for the identified compounds are shown in fig s8 photocatalysis alone transformed tch to 4 ring products with m z values of 423 433 427 and 426 these correspond to products of hydroxylation bond cleavage loss of nh3 and h2o and demethylization niu et al 2013 he et al 2014 zhu et al 2013 they were detected throughout the pc process and fig 4 presents those that had accumulated after a 10 h reaction time this inability of photocatalysis to further transform these kind of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has been reported previously wang et al 2011c niu et al 2013 the 4 ringed structures were mostly destroyed by biodegradation in icpb 1 ultimately only 2 and 3 ring residuals remained having m z values of 225 209 and 245 thus photocatalysis products were further oxidized during icpb which is consistent with our previous finding xiong et al 2017 however further biodegradation of these products may have been stalled due to relative recalcitrance of structures containing multiple aromatic rings and the presence of hydroxyl and kenotic groups yi et al 2011 as these kind of products accumulated after 10 h in icpb 1 when icpb was conducted with naac added icpb 2 most of the products that accumulated in icpb 1 disappeared adding the co substrate produced more biomass and another major impact may have been to accelerate oxygenation reactions by generating

further supports that biodegradation of complex photocatalysis products lowered competition for free radicals and accelerated the removal of tch by photocatalysis 3 4 enhanced microbial survival and activity 3 4 1 biomass and living dead cell ratio as shown in fig s9 adding acetate contributed to an 15 enhancement of biomass accumulation for icpb 2 carriers acetate as an easy to utilize growth
