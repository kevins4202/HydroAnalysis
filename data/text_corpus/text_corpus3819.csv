author intensive membrane cleaning can be used with ceramic membranes since they are physically chemically robust it might therefore be possible for membrane bioreactors mbrs to be operated under the condition of a high membrane flux when ceramic membranes are used with such intensive membrane cleaning in this study bench scale mbrs equipped with flat sheet ceramic membranes were operated for long periods circulation of granular materials cylindrical polyurethane in the tank and frequent chemically enhanced backwash ceb were used as intensive physical cleaning and chemical cleaning in this study respectively experiments were carried out with synthetic wastewater the use of granular materials which can cause significant damage to polymeric membranes kurita et al 2015 was effective for controlling the formation of cake deposition of microbial flocs on the surface of the ceramic membranes when both mechanical cleaning using the granular materials and ceb with 1000 ppm of sodium hypochlorite naclo were applied contrary to an expectation evolution of reversible fouling formation of a transparent gel layer on the membrane surface became uncontrollable whereas irreversible fouling was effectively controlled the use of naclo induced release of organic macromolecules via biomass decay leading to the evolution of reversible fouling when the intensity of ceb with naclo was adequately lowered with the aid of the mechanical cleaning using the granules the bench scale mbr could be operated stably under an elevated membrane flux for a long period 70 days it was postulated that the adjustment of ceb intensity preferably altered properties of organic macromolecules released from biomass the structure of the gel layer was porous when the ceb intensity was lowered when ceb is used in mbrs it is thus important to balance cleaning efficiency and its harmful effect on biomass when adequate ceb is used with intensive mechanical cleaning mbrs with ceramic membranes can be operated under high flux conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment chemically enhanced backwash biomass decay granular materials naclo 1 introduction advantages of membrane bioreactors mbrs over conventional wastewater treatment processes have been recognized for a long time yamamoto et al 1989 stephenson et al 2000 widespread application of mbr technology is however still hindered by membrane fouling intensive aeration is generally carried out in mbrs to control membrane fouling which significantly increases operational costs of mbrs fenu et al 2010 when fouling occurs a large pressure difference is necessary to maintain the treatment capacity which also increases the operational cost to avoid membrane fouling values of membrane flux are generally set at low values i e operation under sub critical flux conditions ognier et al 2004 leading to installment of large membrane areas i e increases in capital costs significantly fouled membranes need to be replaced which also raises the operational costs of mbrs thus control of membrane fouling in mbrs is important and has received significant attention le clech et al 2006 meng et al 2009 2017 drews 2010 various approaches to control membrane fouling in mbrs such as development of new membranes liu et al 2012 lee et al 2013 adjustment of operational conditions alteration of biomass characteristics germain et al 2005 jin et al 2006 liang et al 2007 and detailed characterization of foulants kimura et al 2009 2012 2015 have been examined unfortunately the approaches were not very successful and the application of mbrs is still limited at present ceramic flat sheet membranes have recently become available and they have been used for mbrs in previous studies xue et al 2016 niwa et al 2017 li et al 2018 a ceramic membrane is both physically and chemically robust therefore intensive cleaning that cannot be used for polymeric membranes can be used for ceramic membranes and this may overcome the problem of membrane fouling in mbrs membrane fouling in mbrs can be divided into two types reversible fouling and irreversible fouling kurita et al 2014 reversible fouling is defined as fouling that can be cancelled by physical means whereas irreversible fouling is defined as fouling that needs chemical cleaning to be cancelled intensive physical cleaning should be able to control reversible fouling whereas intensive chemical cleaning would be needed to control irreversible fouling thus it may be possible to develop a fouling free mbr using ceramic membranes if appropriate methods for intensive cleaning are determined one possible method for intensive physical cleaning in mbrs is circulating scouring agents in the tank by aeration aslam et al 2017 the cleaning efficiency of scouring agents can be very high kurita et al 2014 reported almost complete control of reversible fouling by granular materials in an mbr equipped with flat sheet polymeric membranes also they pointed out that the use of granular materials could significantly reduce aeration intensity kurita et al 2014 2015 however a serious drawback in the use of granular materials is that polymeric membranes are significantly damaged siembida et al 2010 kurita et al 2015 when granular materials are used with ceramic membranes there is no problem of membrane damage and reversible fouling can be adequately controlled chemically enhanced backwash ceb would be effective for irreversible fouling when backwash is carried out with permeate augmented by chemical reagents irreversible fouling can be controlled efficient cleaning by ceb in mbrs has been reported zsirai et al 2012 although frequent implementation of ceb has a significant influence on the characteristics of polymeric membranes abdullah and bérubé 2013 and may lead to shortened life time of membranes ceramic membranes should be tolerant to implementation of frequent ceb when both mechanical cleaning using granular materials and ceb are carried out in an mbr both reversible fouling and irreversible fouling can be controlled the use of flat sheet ceramic membranes enables this approach in this study therefore bench scale mbrs equipped with flat sheet ceramic membranes were operated with granular materials and ceb to the best of our knowledge there has been little investigation of such intensive membrane cleaning that can only be used for mbrs equipped with flat sheet ceramic membranes effects of combination of scouring with the granules and intensive ceb on control of fouling in ceramic membranes were investigated for the first time in this study as described later the intensity of ceb is crucial for this approach ceb with excessive intensity accelerated reversible fouling which could not be controlled even by mechanical cleaning using granular materials however when the intensity of ceb was adequately set with the aid of intensive mechanical cleaning the mbr could be operated with high membrane fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 bench scale mbr five long term operations of a bench scale mbr runs 1 5 which is described in detail in the following sections were carried out in this study in all experiments flat sheet ceramic membranes with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm meidensha tokyo japan were used the effective volume of the bench scale mbr used in this study was 7 5 l the membrane area available in the tank was 0 04 m2 aeration was continuously carried out throughout the operation via porous air diffusers installed at the bottom of the reactor aeration rate was fixed at 0 017 nm3 min prior to each run except for run 2 biomass suspension collected from a pilot scale mbr treating municipal wastewater was seeded to the reactor and acclimatized to the synthetic wastewater acclimatization was carried out without ceb for 40 days corresponding to the double of mixed liquor solids retention time srt 20 days set in all long term operations at the initiation of each run thoroughly cleaned membranes were placed in the reactor and used granular materials used for mechanical cleaning were commercially available bcn nissinbo tokyo japan and they were shown to be effective for membrane cleaning in mbrs kurita et al 2014 2015 2016 the granular materials were made from polyurethane and they were cylindrical in shape with a diameter and heights of both 4 mm an apparent volume of 375 ml corresponding to 5 of the effective volume of the reactor of the granular materials was introduced to the reactor when they were used all experiments were conducted in an air conditioned room about 20 c baseline membrane flux was set at 18 8 lmh and intermittent filtration 1 min pause for every 12 min of filtration was carried out throughout the operation synthetic wastewater main carbon source peptone and meat extract used in this study was prepared by following the oecd guidelines oecd 1993 2 2 five long term operations run 1 was carried out as a reference test neither mechanical cleaning using granular materials nor ceb was carried out in run 2 granular materials were introduced to the reactor but ceb was not carried out the differences between runs 1 and 2 are therefore attributed to the effects of granules in run 3 the mbr was operated with granular materials and ceb using sodium hypochrolite naclo in each event of ceb in run 3 80 ml of 1000 ppm as free cl2 naclo solution was injected from the permeate side at a backwash flux of 2 lmh it took 60 min to carry out each ceb intervals of implementation of ceb were not regular in run 3 ceb was carried out when tmp increase was significant in run 3 as described later the ceb condition used in run 3 was found to accelerate membrane fouling in the mbr therefore in run 4 ceb intensity was significantly lowered in run 4 after every 24 h of operation 110 ml of 300 ppm naclo solution was injected at a backwash flux of 56 4 lmh backwash duration was 3 min in run 5 operation of the mbr at elevated fluxes 24 4 lmh and 30 1 lmh was attempted membrane cleaning carried out in run 5 was the same as that in run 4 table 1 summarizes the operational conditions in the five runs before initiating a new run ceramic membranes were thoroughly cleaned by naclo and citric acid after confirming that membrane permeability had been almost completely restored a subsequent experiment was initiated when membranes were subjected to microscopic analysis at the termination of an experiment new membranes were used in the subsequent experiment 2 3 assessment of sludge filterability filterability of the sludge in the bench scale mbr was occasionally assessed by batch filtration experiments using a dead end stirred cell system the effective membrane area in the batch filtration experiments was 37 4 cm2 the stirred cell was filled with 300 ml of biomass suspension collected from the bench scale mbr and compressed nitrogen gas was used to filter the suspension under a constant pressure the filtration pressure was fixed at 10 kpa and the stirring speed in the cell was set at 300 rpm polymeric flat sheet membranes with a pore size of 0 1 μm toray tokyo japan were used for the batch test the membranes used for the batch experiments were made from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf in each filtration virgin membranes were used the membrane permeate flux was measured using an electronic balance filtration was continued for 25 min and the flux recorded at the termination of filtration was used for calculation of filtration resistance the following equation was used for calculation 1 r δ p j μ where r is membrane filtration resistance m 1 j is membrane permeate flux m3 m 2 s 1 δp is trans membrane pressure tmp pa and μ is viscosity of the permeate pa s 2 4 analysis the concentrations of total organic carbon toc and dissolved organic carbon doc were determined using a toc analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu japan samples containing suspended solids were subjected to toc analysis after sonication for 3 min analysis of doc was performed after the suspensions had been filtered using a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane advantec tokyo japan with a pore size of 0 45 μm concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n ions were measured by using ion chromatography dionex ics 90 thermofisher scientific waltham usa concentrations of mlss mlvss were determined by following the standard method rice et al 2012 liquid chromatography with an organic carbon detection lc ocd system model 8 doc labor dr huber germany was used for size based fractionation of organic matter before performing lc ocd analyses the samples were filtered using 0 45 μm filters made from ptfe advantec tokyo japan at the terminations of runs 3 and 5 the fouled membrane surface was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem s 4000 hitachi japan the fouled membranes were broken into small pieces about 1 cm2 by using a needle and a hammer and they were immersed in 2 glutaraldehyde with 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 2 at 5 c overnight to fix the fouled membrane surface morphology the treated samples were then fixed with 1 osmium tetroxide with 0 1 m phosphate buffer at room temperature for 2 h the fixed samples were dehydrated at a series of different concentrations of ethanol after dehydration the samples were immersed twice in isoamyl acetate solution for 15 min the samples were dried using a critical point drying apparatus hcp 1 hitachi japan to avoid deforming the fouled membrane surface morphology the dried samples were coated with platinum to avoid accumulating static electric charge during observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of the granular materials runs 1 and 2 in run 1 as a reference experiment the bench scale mbr was operated without granules after acclimatization of the sludge fig 1 shows the increase in tmp observed in run 1 fig 1 also shows the tmp increase observed in run 2 which was initiated immediately after run 1 and was carried out with the granular materials in run 1 the increase of tmp was rapid the operation could be continued for only 1 2 days despite the fact that the applied membrane flux was normal 18 8 lmh various factors including insufficient aeration rate poor arrangement of air diffusers in the reactor and composition of synthetic wastewater may explain the rapid increase in tmp seen in run 1 as shown later the problem of the rapid increase in tmp was addressed by applying intensive membrane cleaning given that the focus of the present study was on the efficiency of intensive cleaning that can be used with ceramic membranes optimization of design operational parameters pointed out above was not attempted efficient control of membrane fouling by the granular materials was observed in run 2 the rate of increase in tmp was significantly lowered when the granular materials were placed in the reactor the granular materials efficiently prevented the attachment of biomass on the membrane surface a turbulent flow regime created by aeration in normal mbrs operated without granular materials can only reduce the thickness of the laminar boundary layer whereas granular materials can directly make contact with and break down the fouling layer aslam et al 2017 as mentioned before however the granular materials can also cause severe membrane damage siembida et al 2010 kurita et al 2015 by using ceramic membranes such damage of the membranes is not likely to occur the use of granular materials intensive mechanical cleaning with ceramic membranes is therefore recommended in run 2 a surge of tmp was observed on day 7 of the operation this was caused by mechanical trouble in the operation after fixing the trouble tmp rapidly declined and started to slowly increase again on day 18 of the operation the ceramic membranes were taken out from the tank and the formation of a thin gel layer that could not be removed by the granular materials was observed in our previous study using polymeric membranes and granular materials kurita et al 2014 complete removal of cake gel layer from the membrane was observed this difference in cleaning efficiency of granular materials observed in the present study and that observed in the previous study may be due to various factors such as differences in the arrangements of air diffusers the cleaning efficiency of scouring agents can be increased by improving hydrodynamics in the reactor aslam et al 2017 the gel layer formed on the membrane was easily removed by manual physical cleaning using a sponge the physical cleaning however did not restore the membrane permeability to the initial value the slope drawn in fig 1 represents the evolution of irreversible fouling which is defined as fouling that cannot be controlled by physical cleaning and needs chemical cleaning to be cancelled kurita et al 2014 it was expected that irreversible fouling can be efficiently controlled by ceb it was also expected that ceb would increase the efficiency of mechanical cleaning since the chemical agent would break the structures of the gel layer that remained even under the shear stress created by the granules the combination of granular materials and ceb was examined in subsequent experiments 3 2 influence of ceb with a high intensity the mbr was newly acclimatized to the synthetic wastewater and used for run 3 in which the combination of intensive mechanical cleaning granular materials and ceb was examined the acclimatization was carried out with the granular materials being placed in the tank and without implementation of ceb the intensity of ceb used in run 3 80 ml of 1000 ppm naclo injected over a period of 60 min was regarded as relatively high in the present study in full scale installations the amount of naclo used in a single event of ceb is about 0 3 g per 1 m2 of membrane area zsirai et al 2012 whereas the amount used in run 3 in this study was 2 g m2 fig 2 shows the increase in tmp in run 3 contrary to the expectation that the combination of intensive mechanical cleaning and ceb could control the evolution of membrane fouling very efficiently the increase in tmp was very rapid over the entire operational period in fig 2 the implementation of ceb and the implementation of manual physical cleaning wiping with a sponge are represented by white arrows and black arrows respectively the implementation of ceb clearly lowered the value of tmp to maintain the membrane flux however the rate of evolution of tmp did not change after the implementation of ceb and a rapid increase in tmp was repeatedly observed in 10 20 days of operation time ceb and manual physical cleaning were carried out alternatively both the ceb and manual physical cleaning resulted in a reduction of tmp followed by a rapid increase in tmp in the later stage of the operation of run 3 ceb was more frequently carried out as shown in fig 2 however this frequent ceb was not effective for control of membrane fouling rather evolution of fouling became accelerated in the later stage of run 3 suggesting that sludge filterability was deteriorated probably due to the implementation of ceb as described above the amount of naclo used in a single ceb was large in this study also the frequency of ceb implementation in run 3 was considerably higher than that in a full scale installation in which ceb is carried out every 7 14 days zsirai et al 2012 although implementation of such intensive ceb was possible with ceramic membranes it seemed to cause severe membrane fouling in run 3 the formation of a gel layer was uncontrollable and it was responsible for the severe fouling in run 3 a fouling layer that developed on the membrane surface even under the condition of high mechanical stress induced by granular materials was responsible for the rapid increase of tmp in run 3 the fouling layer can be further divided into a cake layer and a gel layer in run 3 due to implementation of mechanical cleaning using the granular materials a cake layer i e deposition of microbial flocs was not present however a transparent gel layer remained on the membrane surface the morphology of the gel layer formed in run 3 was observed by sem fig 3 microbial cells or flocs were not seen on the fouled membrane instead a plain gel layer with a dense structure was found to have covered the membrane surface despite the fact that intensive mechanical cleaning was carried out it was reported that the gel layer that formed on the surface of a membrane used for mbrs was very porous chen et al 2016 in this study implementation of the mechanical cleaning might have made the structure of the gel layer denser as a result of intensive scratching implementation of ceb might also have contributed to the formation of the dense gel layer it was reported that a gel layer was formed by the gelation of colloidal and dissolved matter in a biomass suspension rosenberger et al 2006 wang and waite 2009 particularly soluble microbial products smp properties of biomolecules can be altered by contact with naclo used for ceb zhou et al 2017 it has been shown that contact of biomass with chemical reagents such as naclo induces decay of the biomass and release of smp eps cai et al 2016 in the context of mbr application the possibility of membrane fouling caused by inadequate chemical cleaning has also been pointed out cai and liu 2016 as shown in fig 2 a gradual and steady increase of doc in the tank was observed in run 3 there are two possible reasons for the rapid and repeated formation of a gel layer observed in run 3 first altered properties of organic macromolecules might have facilitated the formation of a gel layer second there might have been an increased concentration amount of the source of the gel layer these two mechanisms could occur simultaneously and might have synergetic effects changes in sludge permeability during run 3 was separately assessed by batch filtration tests using a stirred membrane cell fig 4 shows the results of assessment of sludge filterability conducted over the period of run 3 deterioration in sludge filterability induced by implementation of ceb is clearly shown in fig 4 in previous studies a close relationship between smp and sludge filterability in mbrs was also shown wang et al 2007 koseoglu et al 2008 deng et al 2015 in run 3 increase in doc was also observed fig 2 and it might have deteriorated the sludge filterability 3 3 separate confirmation of the release of organic macromolecules from mbr sludge and evolution of fouling induced by ceb to obtain direct evidence that ceb induces release of dissolved organic matter from mbr sludge and that the released organic matter accelerates membrane fouling in an mbr biomass suspensions were collected from a pilot scale mbr installed at an existing wastewater treatment facility and they were mixed with naclo of different concentrations first a bench scale mbr filled with the biomass suspension collected from the pilot scale mbr mentioned above was spiked with different concentrations of naclo the bench scale mbr was operated under the same conditions as those in run 3 the same ceramic membrane was used for this test assuming that all of the naclo reagents used in a single ceb event in run 3 remained in the tank without any reaction naclo concentration in the mbr was calculated to be 10 7 ppm three different naclo concentrations in the tank 4 4 ppm 7 4 ppm and 14 8 ppm were examined to cover the concentration of 10 7 ppm in the series of spiking tests after spiking the pre determined amounts of naclo membrane filtration was started with a membrane flux of 18 8 lmh fig 5 shows tmp increases in the bench scale mbr filtering the sludge spiked with different concentrations of naclo feeding to the mbr was not carried out during the series of experiments the increase in tmp became more rapid when the concentration of naclo was increased supporting the postulation mentioned in the previous section naclo used in ceb has a negative impact in terms of membrane fouling though it would clean fouled membranes the release of organic matter induced by naclo was also examined by lc ocd analysis fig 6 shows lc ocd chromatograms obtained for supernatants of biomass suspension it is clearly shown that an increase of dissolved organic matter with a wide range of molecular weights was caused by naclo cai et al 2016 also reported generation of dissolved organic matter from activated sludge exposed to naclo at concentrations of 2 20 ppm which is similar to the range examined in this study the same group also showed that such exposure of biomass to naclo increased the membrane fouling rate although they did not use mbrs in the experiment cai and liu 2016 the data obtained in this study figs 2 and 5 showed that the organic matter generated by naclo actually accelerated membrane fouling in mbrs 3 4 ceb with a modest intensity the results shown in fig 5 indicate that the negative impact of ceb using naclo can be mitigated when the intensity of ceb is low it would therefore be technically possible to balance the positive effect chemical membrane cleaning and the negative effect alteration of the properties of organic macromolecules or release of potential foulants from the biomass of naclo by setting a modest intensity of ceb in run 3 section 3 2 it was found that the intensity of ceb used was excessively high resulting in the negative impact of naclo overwhelm its positive impact therefore in the subsequent experiment run 4 ceb intensity was substantially lowered and a long term operation of the bench scale mbr was attempted the bench scale mbr was newly inoculated for this experiment the biomass suspension collected from the pilot scale mbr was acclimatized to the synthetic wastewater in the same manner as that in the previous experiments the operational conditions of the bench scale mbr were the same as the conditions for runs 2 and 3 except for the ceb condition the concentration of the naclo solution used for ceb was reduced to 300 ppm in run 4 after every 24 h of operation 110 ml of 300 ppm naclo solution was injected from the permeate side it took 3 min to complete the injection of naclo solution in run 4 in run 4 ceb was initiated from day 14 of the operation fig 7 shows the increase in tmp observed in run 4 in the first 14 days of operation without implementation of ceb tmp gradually increased as in run 2 the rate of increase in tmp became higher at around day 10 implementation of ceb was initiated from day 14 of operation in contrast to run 3 ceb did not induce rapid increases of tmp in run 4 tmp in fact started to gradually decrease after the initiation of ceb the intensity of ceb examined in run 4 was found to have an ample cleaning effect concerns regarding the implementation of ceb were as observed in run 3 release of organic matter and deterioration of sludge filterability see figs 4 and 6 in run 4 release of organic matter from the biomass was limited the concentration of doc in the tank was 20 mg l after implementation of ceb as a result as shown in fig 7 evolution of membrane fouling was effectively controlled in run 4 the difference between run 3 and run 4 might also be attributed to differences in quality properties of smp organic macromolecules induced by ceb in the two experimental runs zhou et al 2017 reported that characteristics of bio macromolecules effluent biopolymers proteins and polysaccharides were significantly altered by contact with naclo at concentrations in the range that was examined in runs 3 and 4 they also showed that the extent of alteration was dependent on the concentration of naclo therefore it is reasonable to assume that the characteristics of smp organic macromolecules involved in evolution of membrane fouling in runs 3 and 4 were different since the concentrations of naclo were different the importance of qualitative aspects of smp and misleading associated with focusing on quantitative aspects of smp in investigation of fouling in mbrs have been pointed out kimura et al 2009 2012 it should be noted that flux of ceb in run 3 2 lmh and that in run 4 56 4 lmh were very different a low ceb flux set in run 3 was intended to assure a long reaction time between naclo and the fouling layer in contrast ceb flux in run 4 was significantly increased this large difference might have contributed to the efficient membrane cleaning observed in run 4 in a separate test in which the same experimental setting as that in this study was used and in which h2o2 2000 ppm ph 2 7 was used for ceb with the same backwash conditions as those in run 4 except for the chemical reagent membrane fouling could not be controlled see figure s1 in supporting information thus the strong cleaning effects seen in run 4 should be due to naclo the ceb intensity examined in run 4 might still be higher than the optimal intensity wang et el 2014 examined ceb with naclo at considerably low concentrations 0 05 1 5 ppm they found that it effectively controlled membrane fouling in mbrs although the mbrs were operated at a very low membrane flux of 6 lmh in their study the optimal ceb intensity that can balance the positive impact cleaning power and negative impact generation of foulants and alteration of the characteristics of organic matter should be investigated in future studies 3 5 operation with elevated membrane flux in the previous section it was shown that the bench scale mbr could be operated without fouling at a membrane flux of 18 8 lmh by using efficient mechanical cleaning granules and ceb with a modest intensity whereas it could not be operated for more than 1 2 days without such cleaning fig 1 although it is difficult to apply such intensive cleaning with polymeric membranes it is possible with ceramic membranes since the cleaning efficiency of the combination of granular materials and ceb with a modest intensity was considerably high in run 4 it was thought to be possible to operate the mbr with elevated membrane fluxes therefore in the subsequent experiment run 5 membrane flux was increased stepwise from 18 8 lmh to 30 1 lmh in a long term operation of the mbr accordingly hydraulic retention time hrt in the operation was gradually lowered as shown in table 1 the bench scale mbr used in the previous experiments was newly inoculated for run 5 by using a biomass suspension collected from the pilot scale mbr acclimatization of the sludge was carried out in the same manner as that in runs 3 and 4 in run 5 membrane elements submerged in the tank were divided into two filtration channels and each channel was independently operated separate filtration pumps were used for each filtration channel one channel was operated with ceb and the other was operated without ceb by comparing the two channels effects of membrane cleaning provided by ceb could be assessed in run 5 in run 5 granules were placed in the tank and ceb was carried out in the same manner as that in run 4 for one filtration channel fig 8 shows increases in tmp in run 5 in the first phase of run 5 both of the channels were operated with the membrane flux of 18 8 lmh which was also set in the previous runs with the channel operated with ceb as also observed in run 4 evolution of tmp was minimal the combination of granular materials and ceb at a modest intensity worked well tmp in the channel operated without ceb slowly increased in the first phase in run 5 when the membrane flux was increased to 24 4 lmh the difference between the two channels became significant the channel operated without ceb exhibited a rapid increase in tmp whereas the increase in tmp in the channel operated with ceb was still minimal it was found that the cleaning effect of ceb was indispensable for operation of the bench scale mbr with an elevated flux of 24 4 lmh membrane fouling occurring in the channel operated without ceb was mostly reversible fouling since the manual physical cleaning was effective implementation of physical cleaning carried out for the channel without ceb is shown by arrows in fig 8 on day 30 of the operation in run 5 the membrane flux was further increased to 30 1 lmh the channel operated without ceb exhibited a more rapid increase in tmp after the elevation of membrane flux frequent manual physical cleaning was necessary to maintain the operation of the channel operated without ceb in the channel operated with ceb tmp started to increase after membrane flux was elevated to 30 1 lmh however ceb carried out every 24 h still worked well the increase in tmp occurring within 24 h was limited and could be reduced by the ceb without off line physical cleaning using a soft sponge it was possible to continue the filtration using the channel operated with ceb in the hatched period in run 5 day 65 the ceb pump malfunctioned and a rapid increase in tmp was observed this in turn demonstrated the importance and effect of ceb after fixing the malfunction the channel could be operated stably again it should be noted that loading to the reactor gradually increased in run 5 when the flux was increased to 30 1 lmh the reactor showed difficulty in nitrification such an increase in loading to mbrs has been reported to cause membrane fouling trussell et al 2006 intensive membrane cleaning that can be used with ceramic membranes could deal with an increase in the loading an sem image of the fouled membrane surface taken at the termination of run 5 fig 9 supports the aforementioned postulation that the characteristics of smp organic macromolecules involved in evolution of membrane fouling were different depending on the ceb intensity a gel layer was formed in run 5 and the structure of the gel layer observed in run 5 was very different from that observed in run 3 fig 3 the structure of the gel layer formed in run 5 was much more porous than that in run 3 such a porous structure could be attributed to unidentified properties of smp organic macromolecules which should be different in runs 3 and 5 as a result of the different ceb intensity 4 conclusion in this study mbrs equipped with flat sheet ceramic membranes were operated with intensive membrane cleaning effects of mechanical cleaning using granular materials cylindrical polyurethane and ceb using naclo were investigated the granular materials were effective for controlling the formation of cake deposition of microbial flocs on the membrane surface whereas ceb accelerated membrane fouling in some cases formation of a transparent gel layer on the membrane surface became uncontrollable when ceb intensity was high even with the use of granular materials naclo injected into the biomass suspension during ceb promoted release of organic macromolecules such as biopolymers which resulted in deterioration of the filterability of the biomass suspension and formation of the gel layer when the intensity of ceb was adequately adjusted the aforementioned negative effects of ceb were offset by the cleaning effects of ceb when mechanical cleaning using the granular materials was combined with ceb with an adequate intensity evolution of membrane fouling in the mbr was efficiently controlled the interval of ceb is also supposed to play an important role in control of membrane fouling and should be investigated in a future study the combined intensive cleaning enabled operations of the bench scale mbr at high membrane fluxes mbrs equipped with ceramic membranes can be operated with the intensive cleaning examined in this study and thus may be free from the problems associated with fouling declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

values i e operation under sub critical flux conditions ognier et al 2004 leading to installment of large membrane areas i e increases in capital costs significantly fouled membranes need to be replaced which also raises the operational costs of mbrs thus control of membrane fouling in mbrs is important and has received significant attention le clech et al 2006 meng et al 2009 2017 drews 2010 various approaches to control membrane fouling in mbrs such as development of new membranes liu et al 2012 lee et al 2013 adjustment of operational conditions alteration of biomass characteristics germain et al 2005 jin et al 2006 liang et al 2007 and detailed characterization of foulants kimura et al 2009 2012 2015 have been examined unfortunately the approaches were not very successful and the application of mbrs is still limited at present ceramic flat sheet membranes have recently become available and they have been used for mbrs in previous studies xue et al 2016 niwa et al 2017 li et al 2018 a ceramic membrane is both physically and chemically robust therefore intensive cleaning that cannot be used for polymeric membranes can be used for ceramic membranes and this may overcome the problem of membrane fouling in mbrs membrane fouling in mbrs can be divided into two types reversible fouling and irreversible fouling kurita et al 2014 reversible fouling is defined as fouling that can be cancelled by physical means whereas irreversible fouling is defined as fouling that needs chemical cleaning to be cancelled intensive physical cleaning should be able to control reversible fouling whereas intensive chemical cleaning would be needed to control irreversible fouling thus it may be possible to develop a fouling free mbr using ceramic membranes if appropriate methods for intensive cleaning are determined one possible method for intensive physical cleaning in mbrs is circulating scouring agents in the tank by aeration aslam et al 2017 the cleaning efficiency of scouring agents can be very high kurita et al 2014 reported almost complete control of reversible fouling by granular materials in an mbr equipped with flat sheet polymeric membranes also they pointed out that the use of granular materials could significantly reduce aeration intensity kurita et al 2014 2015 however a serious drawback in the use of granular materials is that polymeric membranes are significantly damaged siembida et al 2010 kurita et al 2015 when granular materials are used with ceramic membranes there is no problem of membrane damage and reversible fouling can be adequately controlled chemically enhanced backwash ceb would be effective for irreversible fouling when backwash is carried out with permeate augmented by chemical reagents irreversible fouling can be controlled efficient cleaning by ceb in mbrs has been reported zsirai et al 2012 although frequent implementation of ceb has a significant influence on the characteristics of polymeric membranes abdullah and bérubé 2013 and may lead to shortened life time of membranes ceramic membranes should be tolerant to implementation of frequent ceb when both mechanical cleaning using granular materials and ceb are carried out in an mbr both reversible fouling and irreversible fouling can be controlled the use of flat sheet ceramic membranes enables this approach in this study therefore bench scale mbrs equipped with flat sheet ceramic membranes were operated with granular materials and ceb to the best of our knowledge there has been little investigation of such intensive membrane cleaning that can only be used for mbrs equipped with flat sheet ceramic membranes effects of combination of scouring with the granules and intensive ceb on control of fouling in ceramic membranes were investigated for the first time in this study as described later the intensity of ceb is crucial for this approach ceb with excessive intensity accelerated reversible fouling which could not be controlled even by mechanical cleaning using granular materials however when the intensity of ceb was adequately set with the aid of intensive mechanical cleaning the mbr could be operated with high membrane fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 bench scale mbr five long term operations of a bench scale mbr runs 1 5 which is described in detail in the following sections were carried out in this study in all experiments flat sheet ceramic membranes with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm meidensha tokyo japan were used the effective volume of the bench scale mbr used in this study was 7 5 l the membrane area available in the tank was 0 04 m2 aeration was continuously carried out throughout the operation via porous air diffusers installed at the bottom of the reactor aeration rate was fixed at 0 017 nm3 min prior to each run except for run 2 biomass suspension collected from a pilot scale mbr treating municipal wastewater was seeded to the reactor and acclimatized to the synthetic wastewater acclimatization was carried out without ceb for 40 days corresponding to the double of mixed liquor solids retention time srt 20 days set in all long term operations at the initiation of each run thoroughly cleaned membranes were placed in the reactor and used granular materials used for mechanical cleaning were commercially available bcn nissinbo tokyo japan and they were shown to be effective for membrane cleaning in mbrs kurita et al 2014 2015 2016 the granular materials were made from polyurethane and they were cylindrical in shape with a diameter and heights of both 4 mm an apparent volume of 375 ml corresponding to 5 of the effective volume of the reactor of the granular materials was introduced to the reactor when they were used all experiments were conducted in an air conditioned room about 20 c baseline membrane flux was set at 18 8 lmh and intermittent filtration 1 min pause for every 12 min of filtration was carried out throughout the operation synthetic wastewater main carbon source peptone and meat extract used in this study was prepared by following the oecd guidelines oecd 1993 2 2 five long term operations run 1 was carried out as a reference test neither mechanical cleaning using granular materials nor ceb was carried out in run 2 granular materials were introduced to the reactor but ceb was not carried out the differences between runs 1 and 2 are therefore attributed to the effects of granules in run 3 the mbr was operated with granular materials and ceb using sodium hypochrolite naclo in each event of ceb in run 3 80 ml of 1000 ppm as free cl2 naclo solution was injected from the permeate side at a backwash flux of 2 lmh it took 60 min to carry out each ceb intervals of implementation of ceb were not regular in run 3 ceb was carried out when tmp increase was significant in run 3 as described later the ceb condition used in run 3 was found to accelerate membrane fouling in the mbr therefore in run 4 ceb intensity was significantly lowered in run 4 after every 24 h of operation 110 ml of 300 ppm naclo solution was injected at a backwash flux of 56 4 lmh backwash duration was 3 min in run 5 operation of the mbr at elevated fluxes 24 4 lmh and 30 1 lmh was attempted membrane cleaning carried out in run 5 was the same as that in run 4 table 1 summarizes the operational conditions in the five runs before initiating a new run ceramic membranes were thoroughly cleaned by naclo and citric acid after confirming that membrane permeability had been almost completely restored a subsequent experiment was initiated when membranes were subjected to microscopic analysis at the termination of an experiment new membranes were used in the subsequent experiment 2 3 assessment of sludge filterability filterability of the sludge in the bench scale mbr was occasionally assessed by batch filtration experiments using a dead end stirred cell system the effective membrane area in the batch filtration experiments was 37 4 cm2 the stirred cell was filled with 300 ml of biomass suspension collected from the bench scale mbr and compressed nitrogen gas was used to filter the suspension under a constant pressure the filtration pressure was fixed at 10 kpa and the stirring speed in the cell was set at 300 rpm polymeric flat sheet membranes with a pore size of 0 1 μm toray tokyo japan were used for the batch test the membranes used for the batch experiments were made from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf in each filtration virgin membranes were used the membrane permeate flux was measured using an electronic balance filtration was continued for 25 min and the flux recorded at the termination of filtration was used for calculation of filtration resistance the following equation was used for calculation 1 r δ p j μ where r is membrane filtration resistance m 1 j is membrane permeate flux m3 m 2 s 1 δp is trans membrane pressure tmp pa and μ is viscosity of the permeate pa s 2 4 analysis the concentrations of total organic carbon toc and dissolved organic carbon doc were determined using a toc analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu japan samples containing suspended solids were subjected to toc analysis after sonication for 3 min analysis of doc was performed after the suspensions had been filtered using a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane advantec tokyo japan with a pore size of 0 45 μm concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n ions were measured by using ion chromatography dionex ics 90 thermofisher scientific waltham usa concentrations of mlss mlvss were determined by following the standard method rice et al 2012 liquid chromatography with an organic carbon detection lc ocd system model 8 doc labor dr huber germany was used for size based fractionation of organic matter before performing lc ocd analyses the samples were filtered using 0 45 μm filters made from ptfe advantec tokyo japan at the terminations of runs 3 and 5 the fouled membrane surface was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem s 4000 hitachi japan the fouled membranes were broken into small pieces about 1 cm2 by using a needle and a hammer and they were immersed in 2 glutaraldehyde with 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 2 at 5 c overnight to fix the fouled membrane surface morphology the treated samples were then fixed with 1 osmium tetroxide with 0 1 m phosphate buffer at room temperature for 2 h the fixed samples were dehydrated at a series of different concentrations of ethanol after dehydration the samples were immersed twice in isoamyl acetate solution for 15 min the samples were dried using a critical point drying apparatus hcp 1 hitachi japan to avoid deforming the fouled membrane surface morphology the dried samples were coated with platinum to avoid accumulating static electric charge during observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of the granular materials runs 1 and 2 in run 1 as a reference experiment the bench scale mbr was operated without granules after acclimatization of the sludge fig 1 shows the increase in tmp observed in run 1 fig 1 also shows the tmp increase observed in run 2 which was initiated immediately after run 1 and was carried out with the granular materials in run 1 the increase of tmp was rapid the operation could be continued for only 1 2 days despite the fact that the applied membrane flux was normal 18 8 lmh various factors including insufficient aeration rate poor arrangement of air diffusers in the reactor and composition of synthetic wastewater may explain the rapid increase in tmp seen in run 1 as shown later the problem of the rapid increase in tmp was addressed by applying intensive membrane cleaning given that the focus of the present study was on the efficiency of intensive cleaning that can be used with ceramic membranes optimization of design operational parameters pointed out above was not attempted efficient control of membrane fouling by the granular materials was observed in run 2 the rate of increase in tmp was significantly lowered when the granular materials were placed in the reactor the granular materials efficiently prevented the attachment of biomass on the membrane surface a turbulent flow regime created by aeration in normal mbrs operated without granular materials can only reduce the thickness of the laminar boundary layer whereas granular materials can directly make contact with and break down the fouling layer aslam et al 2017 as mentioned before however the granular materials can also cause severe membrane damage siembida et al 2010 kurita et al 2015 by using ceramic membranes such damage of the membranes is not likely to occur the use of granular materials intensive mechanical cleaning with ceramic membranes is therefore recommended in run 2 a surge of tmp was observed on day 7 of the operation this was caused by mechanical trouble in the operation after fixing the trouble tmp rapidly declined and started to slowly increase again on day 18 of the operation the ceramic membranes were taken out from the tank and the formation of a thin gel layer that could not be removed by the granular materials was observed in our previous study using polymeric membranes and granular materials kurita et al 2014 complete removal of cake gel layer from the membrane was observed this difference in cleaning efficiency of granular materials observed in the present study and that observed in the previous study may be due to various factors such as differences in the arrangements of air diffusers the cleaning efficiency of scouring agents can be increased by improving hydrodynamics in the reactor aslam et al 2017 the gel layer formed on the membrane was easily removed by manual physical cleaning using a sponge the physical cleaning however did not restore the membrane permeability to the initial value the slope drawn in fig 1 represents the evolution of irreversible fouling which is defined as fouling that cannot be controlled by physical cleaning and needs chemical cleaning to be cancelled kurita et al 2014 it was expected that irreversible fouling can be efficiently controlled by ceb it was also expected that ceb would increase the efficiency of mechanical cleaning since the chemical agent would break the structures of the gel layer that remained even under the shear stress created by the granules the combination of granular materials and ceb was examined in subsequent experiments 3 2 influence of ceb with a high intensity the mbr was newly acclimatized to the synthetic wastewater and used for run 3 in which the combination of intensive mechanical cleaning granular materials and ceb was examined the acclimatization was carried out with the granular materials being placed in the tank and without implementation of ceb the intensity of ceb used in run 3 80 ml of 1000 ppm naclo injected over a period of 60 min was regarded as relatively high in the present study in full scale installations the amount of naclo used in a single event of ceb is about 0 3 g per 1 m2 of membrane area zsirai et al 2012 whereas the amount used in run 3 in this study was 2 g m2 fig 2 shows the increase in tmp in run 3 contrary to the expectation that the combination of intensive mechanical cleaning and ceb could control the evolution of membrane fouling very efficiently the increase in tmp was very rapid over the entire operational period in fig 2 the implementation of ceb and the implementation of manual physical cleaning wiping with a sponge are represented by white arrows and black arrows respectively the implementation of ceb clearly lowered the value of tmp to maintain the membrane flux however the rate of evolution of tmp did not change after the implementation of ceb and a rapid increase in tmp was repeatedly observed in 10 20 days of operation time ceb and manual physical cleaning were carried out alternatively both the ceb and manual physical cleaning resulted in a reduction of tmp followed by a rapid increase in tmp in the later stage of the operation of run 3 ceb was more frequently carried out as shown in fig 2 however this frequent ceb was not effective for control of membrane fouling rather evolution of fouling became accelerated in the later stage of run 3 suggesting that sludge filterability was deteriorated probably due to the implementation of ceb as described above the amount of naclo used in a single ceb was large in this study also the frequency of ceb implementation in run 3 was considerably higher than that in a full scale installation in which ceb is carried out every 7 14 days zsirai et al 2012 although implementation of such intensive ceb was possible with ceramic membranes it seemed to cause severe membrane fouling in run 3 the formation of a gel layer was uncontrollable and it was responsible for the severe fouling in run 3 a fouling layer that developed on the membrane surface even under the condition of high mechanical stress induced by granular materials was responsible for the rapid increase of tmp in run 3 the fouling layer can be further divided into a cake layer and a gel layer in run 3 due to implementation of mechanical cleaning using the granular materials a cake layer i e deposition of microbial flocs was not present however a transparent gel layer remained on the membrane surface the morphology of the gel layer formed in run 3 was observed by sem fig 3 microbial cells or flocs were not seen on the fouled membrane instead a plain gel layer with a dense structure was found to have covered the membrane surface despite the fact that intensive mechanical cleaning was carried out it was reported that the gel layer that formed on the surface of a membrane used for mbrs was very porous chen et al 2016 in this study implementation of the mechanical cleaning might have made the structure of the gel layer denser as a result of intensive scratching implementation of ceb might also have contributed to the formation of the dense gel layer it was reported that a gel layer was formed by the gelation of colloidal and dissolved matter in a biomass suspension rosenberger et al 2006 wang and waite 2009 particularly soluble microbial products smp properties of biomolecules can be altered by contact with naclo used for ceb zhou et al 2017 it has been shown that contact of biomass with chemical reagents such as naclo induces decay of the biomass and release of smp eps cai et al 2016 in the context of mbr application the possibility of membrane fouling caused by inadequate chemical cleaning has also been pointed out cai and liu 2016 as shown in fig 2 a gradual and steady increase of doc in the tank was observed in run 3 there are two possible reasons for the rapid and repeated formation of a gel layer observed in run 3 first altered properties of organic macromolecules might have facilitated the formation of a gel layer second there might have been an increased concentration amount of the source of the gel layer these two mechanisms could occur simultaneously and might have synergetic effects changes in sludge permeability during run 3 was separately assessed by batch filtration tests using a stirred membrane cell fig 4 shows the results of assessment of sludge filterability conducted over the period of run 3 deterioration in sludge filterability induced by implementation of ceb is clearly shown in fig 4 in previous studies a close relationship between smp and sludge filterability in mbrs was also shown wang et al 2007 koseoglu et al 2008 deng et al 2015 in run 3 increase in doc was also observed fig 2 and it might have deteriorated the sludge filterability 3 3 separate confirmation of the release of organic macromolecules from mbr sludge and evolution of fouling induced by ceb to obtain direct evidence that ceb induces release of dissolved organic matter from mbr sludge and that the released organic matter accelerates membrane fouling in an mbr biomass suspensions were collected from a pilot scale mbr installed at an existing wastewater treatment facility and they were mixed with naclo of different concentrations first a bench scale mbr filled with the biomass suspension collected from the pilot scale mbr mentioned above was spiked with different concentrations of naclo the bench scale mbr was operated under the same conditions as those in run 3 the same ceramic membrane was used for this test assuming that all of the naclo reagents used in a single ceb event in run 3 remained in the tank without any reaction naclo concentration in the mbr was calculated to be 10 7 ppm three different naclo concentrations in the tank 4 4 ppm 7 4 ppm and 14 8 ppm were examined to cover the concentration of 10 7 ppm in the series of spiking tests after spiking the pre determined amounts of naclo membrane filtration was started with a membrane flux of 18 8 lmh fig 5 shows tmp increases in the bench scale mbr filtering the sludge spiked with different concentrations of naclo feeding to the mbr was not carried out during the series of experiments the increase in tmp became more rapid when the concentration of naclo was increased supporting the postulation mentioned in the previous section naclo used in ceb has a negative impact in terms of membrane fouling though it would clean fouled membranes the release of organic matter induced by naclo was also examined by lc ocd analysis fig 6 shows lc ocd chromatograms obtained for supernatants of biomass suspension it is clearly shown that an increase of dissolved organic matter with a wide range of molecular weights was caused by naclo cai et al 2016 also reported generation of dissolved organic matter from activated sludge exposed to naclo at concentrations of 2 20 ppm which is similar to the range examined in this study the same group also showed that such exposure of biomass to naclo increased the membrane fouling rate although they did not use mbrs in the experiment cai and liu 2016 the data obtained in this study figs 2 and 5 showed that the organic matter generated by naclo actually accelerated membrane fouling in mbrs 3 4 ceb with a modest intensity the results shown in fig 5 indicate that the negative impact of ceb using naclo can be mitigated when the intensity of ceb is low it would therefore be technically possible to balance the positive effect chemical membrane cleaning and the negative effect alteration of the properties of organic macromolecules or release of potential foulants from the biomass of naclo by setting a modest intensity of ceb in run 3 section 3 2 it was found that the intensity of ceb used was excessively high resulting in the negative impact of naclo overwhelm its positive impact therefore in the subsequent experiment run 4 ceb intensity was substantially lowered and a long term operation of the bench scale mbr was attempted the bench scale mbr was newly inoculated for this experiment the biomass suspension collected from the pilot scale mbr was acclimatized to the synthetic wastewater in the same manner as that in the previous experiments the operational conditions of the bench scale mbr were the same as the conditions for runs 2 and 3 except for the ceb condition the concentration of the naclo solution used for ceb was reduced to 300 ppm in run 4 after every 24 h of operation 110 ml of 300 ppm naclo solution was injected from the permeate side it took 3 min to complete the injection of naclo solution in run 4 in run 4 ceb was initiated from day 14 of the operation fig 7 shows the increase in tmp observed in run 4 in the first 14 days of operation without implementation of ceb tmp gradually increased as in run 2 the rate of increase in tmp became higher at around day 10 implementation of ceb was initiated from day 14 of operation in contrast to run 3 ceb did not induce rapid increases of tmp in run 4 tmp in fact started to gradually decrease after the initiation of ceb the intensity of ceb examined in run 4 was found to have an ample cleaning effect concerns regarding the implementation of ceb were as observed in run 3 release of organic matter and deterioration of sludge filterability see figs 4 and 6 in run 4 release of organic matter from the biomass was limited the concentration of doc in the tank was 20 mg l after implementation of ceb as a result as shown in fig 7 evolution of membrane fouling was effectively controlled in run 4 the difference between run 3 and run 4 might also be attributed to differences in quality properties of smp organic macromolecules induced by ceb in the two experimental runs zhou et al 2017 reported that characteristics of bio macromolecules effluent biopolymers proteins and polysaccharides were significantly altered by contact with naclo at concentrations in the range that was examined in runs 3 and 4 they also showed that the extent of alteration was dependent on the concentration of naclo therefore it is reasonable to assume that the characteristics of smp organic macromolecules involved in evolution of membrane fouling in runs 3 and 4 were different since the concentrations of naclo were different the importance of qualitative aspects of smp and misleading associated with focusing on quantitative aspects of smp in investigation of fouling in mbrs have been pointed out kimura et al 2009 2012 it should be noted that flux of ceb in run 3 2 lmh and that in run 4 56 4 lmh were very different a low ceb flux set in run 3 was intended to assure a long reaction time between naclo and the fouling layer in contrast ceb flux in run 4 was significantly increased this large difference might have contributed to the efficient membrane cleaning observed in run 4 in a separate test in which the same experimental setting as that in this study was used and in which h2o2 2000 ppm ph 2 7 was used for ceb with the same backwash conditions as those in run 4 except for the chemical reagent membrane fouling could not be controlled see figure s1 in supporting information thus the strong cleaning effects seen in run 4 should be due to naclo the ceb intensity examined in run 4 might still be higher than the optimal intensity wang et el 2014 examined ceb with naclo at considerably low concentrations 0 05 1 5 ppm they found that it effectively controlled membrane fouling in mbrs although the mbrs were operated at a very low membrane flux of 6 lmh in their study the optimal ceb intensity that can balance the positive impact cleaning power and negative impact generation of foulants and alteration of the characteristics of organic matter should be investigated in future studies 3 5 operation with elevated membrane flux in the previous section it was shown that the bench scale mbr could be operated without fouling at a membrane flux of 18 8 lmh by using efficient mechanical cleaning granules and ceb with a modest intensity whereas it could not be operated for more than 1 2 days without such cleaning fig 1 although it is difficult to apply such intensive cleaning with polymeric membranes it is possible with ceramic membranes since the cleaning efficiency of the combination of granular materials and ceb with a modest intensity was considerably high in run 4 it was thought to be possible to operate the mbr with elevated membrane fluxes therefore in the subsequent experiment run 5 membrane flux was increased stepwise from 18 8 lmh to 30 1 lmh in a long term operation of the mbr accordingly hydraulic retention time hrt in the operation was gradually lowered as shown in table 1 the bench scale mbr used in the previous experiments was newly inoculated for run 5 by using a biomass suspension collected from the pilot scale mbr acclimatization of the sludge was carried out in the same manner as that in runs 3 and 4 in run 5 membrane elements submerged in the tank were divided into two filtration channels and each channel was independently operated separate filtration pumps were used for each filtration channel one channel was operated with ceb and the other was operated without ceb by comparing the two channels effects of membrane cleaning provided by ceb could be assessed in run 5 in run 5 granules were placed in the tank and ceb was carried out in the same manner as that in run 4 for one filtration channel fig 8 shows increases in tmp in run 5 in the first phase of run 5 both of the channels were operated with the membrane flux of 18 8 lmh which was also set in the previous runs with the channel operated with ceb as also observed in run 4 evolution of tmp was minimal the combination of granular materials and ceb at a modest intensity worked well tmp in the channel operated without ceb slowly increased in the first phase in run 5 when the membrane flux was increased to 24 4 lmh the difference between the two channels became significant the channel operated without ceb exhibited a rapid increase in tmp whereas the increase in tmp in the channel operated with ceb was still minimal it was found that the cleaning effect of ceb was indispensable for operation of the bench scale mbr with an elevated flux of 24 4 lmh membrane fouling occurring in the channel operated without ceb was mostly reversible fouling since the manual physical cleaning was effective implementation of physical cleaning carried out for the channel without ceb is shown by arrows in fig 8 on day 30 of the operation in run 5 the membrane flux was further increased to 30 1 lmh the channel operated without ceb exhibited a more rapid increase in tmp after the elevation of membrane flux frequent manual physical cleaning was necessary to maintain the operation of the channel operated without ceb in the channel operated with ceb tmp started to increase after membrane flux was elevated to 30 1 lmh however ceb carried out every 24 h still worked well the increase in tmp occurring within 24 h was limited and could be reduced by the ceb without off line physical cleaning using a soft sponge it was possible to continue the filtration using the channel operated with ceb in the hatched period in run 5 day 65 the ceb pump malfunctioned and a rapid increase in tmp was observed this in turn demonstrated the importance and effect of ceb after fixing the malfunction the channel could be operated stably again it should be noted that loading to the reactor gradually increased in run 5 when the flux was increased to 30 1 lmh the reactor showed difficulty in nitrification such an increase in loading to mbrs has been reported to cause membrane fouling trussell et al 2006 intensive membrane cleaning that can be used with ceramic membranes could deal with an increase in the loading an sem image of the fouled membrane surface taken at the termination of run 5 fig 9 supports the aforementioned postulation that the characteristics of smp organic macromolecules involved in evolution of membrane fouling were different depending on the ceb intensity a gel layer was formed in run 5 and the structure of the gel layer observed in run 5 was very different from that observed in run 3 fig 3 the structure of the gel layer formed in run 5 was much more porous than that in run 3 such a porous structure could be attributed to unidentified properties of smp organic macromolecules which should be different in runs 3 and 5 as a result of the different ceb intensity 4 conclusion in this study mbrs equipped with flat sheet ceramic membranes were operated with intensive membrane cleaning effects of mechanical cleaning using granular materials cylindrical polyurethane and ceb using naclo were investigated the granular materials were effective for controlling the formation of cake deposition of microbial flocs on the membrane surface whereas ceb accelerated membrane fouling in some cases formation of a transparent gel layer on the membrane surface became uncontrollable when ceb intensity was high even with the use of granular materials naclo injected into the biomass suspension during ceb promoted release of organic macromolecules such as biopolymers which resulted in deterioration of the filterability of the biomass suspension and formation of the gel layer when the intensity of ceb was adequately adjusted the aforementioned negative effects of ceb were offset by the cleaning effects of ceb when mechanical cleaning using the granular materials was combined with ceb with an adequate intensity evolution of membrane fouling in the mbr was efficiently controlled the interval of ceb is also supposed to play an important role in control of membrane fouling and should be investigated in a future study the combined intensive cleaning enabled operations of the bench scale mbr at high membrane fluxes mbrs equipped with ceramic membranes can be operated with the intensive cleaning examined in this study and thus may be free from the problems associated with fouling declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

0 μg l 1 they were unable to reach a conclusion regarding hssf efficiency to remove microcystin and more studies to confirm the real hssf potential were recommended considering the lack of research on cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin removal in hssf this paper aims to investigate the potential of hssfs made of polyvinyl chloride pvc operating in intermittent and continuous flow regimes in the removal of m aeruginosa cells and microcystin lr 2 materials and methods 2 1 household slow sand filters two full scale hssfs were constructed in opaque pvc using the prototype cawst 2012 as a base model one hssf was designed to operate intermittently i hssf and the other to operate continuously c hssf both filters were constructed with a 250 mm inside diameter cross sectional area 0 049 m2 hssf designs are presented in fig 1 the filter media was a 55 cm fine sand layer with an effective size d10 of 0 153 mm uniformity coefficient uc of 1 68 and porosity of 45 the fine sand layer weight was approximately 39 kg support materials consisted of a 5 cm layer of coarse sand 5 cm layer of fine gravel and 7 5 cm layer of medium gravel materials were washed sun dried and sieved using commercial sieves a non woven synthetic fabric blanket or felt blanket specific gravity 0 2 g cm 3 composition 100 polyester and thickness 2 mm was positioned at the filter media top in order to facilitate hssf operation and maintenance all material used in construction and filling of the hssfs were bought at local stores in são carlos city sp brazil precautions were taken to ensure the use of simple easy to find tools and materials throughout the hssf construction and operation processes 2 2 household slow sand filter operation hssfs were operated for 63 continuous days from november 22 2016 to january 23 2017 the studied water was prepared daily at 8 a m by diluting 1 5 l of m aeruginosa culture into 133 5 l of well water no ph correction was made the preparation provided 135 l of studied water table 1 hssf filtration rates were determined based on the daily water volume needed for activities in a simple residence estimated to be approximately 60 l day 1 the chssf design maintained a steady hydraulic head and its filtration rate was kept constant at 1 22 m3 m 2 day 1 0 04 l min 1 the chssf filtration rate was controlled by a needle valve faucet installed in the outlet pipe on the other hand the i hssf hydraulic head was variable and consequently the filtration rate as well i hssf maximum filtration rate was 2 95 m3 m 2 day 1 0 06 l min 1 right after feeding and it decreased to zero for continuous operation 75 l of the studied water was pumped to an elevated 150 l water tank placed next to the filters a submersible water pump hm 5063 jeneca electromechanical co ltd hong kong was used to maintain a homogeneous mixture inside the water tank a hose connected to the elevated water tank outlet tube conducted the water to the filter studied water entered chssf through a side perforation above the filter media top equipped with a float valve the continuous feeding system was designed to maintain a steady hydraulic head and to equalize the water supply in the chssf avoiding oscillations that could influence the treatment this adaptation resulted in a constant 10 cm hydraulic head the remaining 60 l inside the elevated water tank was used for i hssf feeding there was an extra reservoir coupled to the top of the i hssf constituted by a 13 6 l plastic container with a bottom hole equipped with a plastic float valve a pvc section with 30 cm length and 250 mm diameter was attached to the container in order to increase its working volume studied water was poured into the container and the float valve controlled it entering into i hssf this device was used as a diffuser surrogate with the advantage of being able to control the maximum hydraulic head within the filter it can be observed that the float did not reduce the volume that could be added to the filters it only limited the maximum water level above the standing water and consequently the maximum filtration rate based mainly on a daily household routine i hssf feeding was done four times a day 8 a m 12 p m 4 p m and 8 p m the adopted i hssf water charge intervals resulted in two distinct retention times 4 h between successive feedings and 12 h between the last feeding and the first feeding of the next day charge volume was 15 l the sum of standing water volume and filter media and support layer pore volumes named filter volume each feeding was done transferring the water from the elevated water tank into the i hssf using a plastic container 2 3 tracer tests the chssf and i hssf flow characterizations were carried out using 100 mg l 1 sodium chloride nacl solution as a tracer which was poured into the filters considering the particularities of each design the variation of electric conductivity in the filtered water was detected in real time using a conductivity probe vernier software technology usa positioned at the end of the outlet pipe probe calibration allowed correlating conductivity variation with tracer concentration the data was collected by the software logger lite vernier software technology eua and processed by the software excel 2016 microsoft eua and origin 8 6 originlab eua tracer tests were performed in triplicate in i hssf tracer tests the first feeding was made with nacl solution and the subsequent feedings with well water the filtration rate declined to zero when the hydraulic head reached the minimum level at which time a new charging was performed the volume of each filter charging was the filter volume 15 l the procedure resulted in concentration versus filter volume c vs v curves with a positive step followed by a negative step i e increase in concentration followed by a decrease in concentration i hssf tracer test results were analysed according to those proposed by elliott et al 2008 and bradley 2011 hydraulic retention time hrt was obtained and morrill dispersion index mdi was calculated in accordance with tchobanoglous et al 2003 mdi is the ratio between the time in which 10 and 90 of the tracer exits the filter respectively the index ranges from 1 0 for ideal plug flow rectors to 22 for ideal complete mix reactors in chssf tracer tests the step input was applied for tracer injection as recommended by levenspiel 1999 the filtration rate was the same used during the filter operation 1 22 m3 m 2 day 1 the hrt was determined and concentration versus time c vs t curves were plotted the flow pattern was adjusted into three hydrodynamic mathematical models reported in levenspiel 1999 dispersion models low dispersion and high dispersion and n continuous stirred tank reactors model n cstrs adjusted mathematical models estimated whether the chssf flow pattern resembled a plug flow reactor or n ideal stirred tanks in series mdi was also calculated between each test chssf was cleaned with well water until the nacl solution from the previous test was completely removed 2 4 cyanobacterial culture m aeruginosa cultivation was carried out in an experimental facility the inoculum strain bb005 was supplied by the laboratory of phycology from the federal university of são carlos ufscar brazil cyanobacteria were grown in a batch culture system at wc medium according to guillard and lorenzen 1972 in 2 l erlenmeyer flasks aerated by aquarium pumps before being injected into the culture the air passed through a 0 2 μm porosity polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe filter sartorius stedim usa luminous intensity provided by cool white tubular fluorescent lamps was approximately 60 μmol m 2 s 1 a 12 h photoperiod was applied and the average temperature was 25 2 c to maintain an aseptic environment germicidal lamps were turned on for 15 min prior and after the doors in the experimental facility were opened the subculture was executed inside a laminar flow cabinet the new medium and all the materials were autoclaved and received a uv radiation bath before the procedure the experimental facility provided conditions that allowed maintenance of the needed m aeruginosa suspension volume during the hssf operational period 2 5 sample collection and analysis filtered water samples and studied water samples were collected in 350 ml amber glass bottles the chssf sample collection was performed once a day while the i hssf sample collection was made a few minutes after each water charge i hssf samples were divided by its residence time samples collected at 12 p m 4 p m and 8 p m relative to 8 a m 12 p m and 4 p m water charges respectively with 4 h feeding intervals were collected as a composed sample i hssf 4 h samples collected at 8 a m relative to 8 p m water charge from the day before with 12 h feeding intervals were labelled as i hssf 12 h all the samples were stored in a cold chamber and analysed the day after collection for microcystin lr analyses sample aliquots were frozen in eppendorf tubes with locking caps the microcystin lr determination method used was an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa microcystin plate kit cat 20 0068 beacon eua based on studied water microcystin lr concentrations from previous analyses all the samples were diluted in deionized water at a 1 10 ratio in order to maintain microcystin lr concentration within the method s limits of quantification 0 1 μg l 1 2 0 μg l 1 water quality parameters analysed were apparent colour dm cor colorimeter digimed brazil turbidity 2100 n turbidimeter hach company usa

counting chamber and bx51 microscope olympus japan moreover monitoring analyses were performed to assure the filters operational stability monitoring analyses were ph dm20 ph meter digimed brazil temperature partial and total alkalinity and conductivity dm32 conductivity meter digimed brazil studied water was also analysed for the aforementioned parameters and i hssf and chssf efficiency were determined as well as their ripening times by the end of the two month operation schmutzdecke samples were collected from the felt blanket and from the filter media s first millimetres the bx51 microscope olympus japan was used to capture images from schmutzdecke microorganisms for visual identification furthermore scanning electron microscope sem zeiss leo 440 cambridge england was used to capture felt blanket photomicrographs before and after operation time in order to visualize potential fibre alterations caused by the development of microorganisms finally acute ecotoxicological assays were performed with chironomus xanthus larvae the aim was to investigate acute toxicity by residual microcystin lr in filtered water or by contact with the filter materials in the assay six 6 c xanthus iv instar larvae were exposed to 250 ml of studied water or filtered water for 96 h after which the number of viable larvae was determined tests were carried out in triplicate in two operational moments at 14 days of operation and at 63 days of operation 1 l samples were taken from each filter for ecotoxicological assays and no composed sample was used the kruskal wallis test was used to compare data from the filtered water samples among each other and with studied water 95 confidence interval when statistical analyses indicated that the mean values were significantly different the mann whitney test was used to determine which sample was significantly different from another 95 confidence interval 3 results and discussion 3 1 tracer tests i hssf tracer tests results are shown in fig 2 a the increase in effluent tracer concentration ranging from 0 mg l 1 to the maximum concentration of 83 mg l 1 occurred on 1 filter volume the same happened when the concentration declined between the second and third filter volumes this behaviour is expected from a plug flow reactor bradley et al 2011 fig 2a also shows that the i hssf effluent tracer concentration 83 mg l 1 did not reach the influent tracer concentration 100 mg l 1 the approximately 27 difference can be attributed to the filter s hydraulic head which may have diluted the tracer solution i hssf hrt was approximately 239 min 3 h and 59 min feeding intervals of 4 h between successive feedings were close to i hssf hrt which resulted in practically no pause period according to cawst 2012 the hssf pause period should not be lower than 1 h or higher than 48 h however cawst s hssf has a maximum filtration rate of 9 6 m3 m 2 day 1 and an hrt of about 1 0 h while the present pvc design operates at a maximum filtration rate of 2 95 m3 m 2 day 1 and almost 4 0 h hrt it was expected that the lower filtration rate compensated the absence of a pause period furthermore a daily genuine household routine was given more attention than the pause period in the decision of feeding intervals for the overnight feeding interval the pause period was 8 h i hssf mdi was 1 88 0 03 slightly higher than some reports in the literature such as elliott et al 2008 who observed an mdi of 1 3 and bradley et al 2011 who obtained an mdi of 1 4 in commercial plastic hssfs hydraid usa however the result obtained was similar to that observed by young rojanschi and madramootoo 2015 who found an mdi value of 1 8 in addition the obtained mdi characterizes the i hssf flow as an effective plug flow reactor according to the usepa classification usepa 1986 the chssf experimental hrt was 417 min 6 h and 57 min used to determine the sample collection time tracer tests c vs t curves are presented in fig 2b the n cstr model better adjusted the chssf flow pattern with an r2 of 0 69 and n 6 the higher the n value is the closer to the plug flow the reactor is levenspiel 1999 chssf mdi was 2 69 0 08 which means that a continuous flow filter could not be considered an effective plug flow reactor according to the usepa classification us environmental protection agency 1986 chssf s low n value and high mdi may not be representative of the flow through filter media itself using a needle faucet to control the flow might have caused water to accumulate on the larger diameter section in the outlet tube leading to the formation of a mixing zone considering that in i hssf the needle faucet does not control its flow there was no water accumulation on the larger diameter section in the outlet tube i e no mixing zone formation which could explain the mdi differences between i hssf and chssf 3 2 household slow sand filter operation both filters maturation ripening were observed to happen slowly according to cawst 2012 the hssf maturation time lasts about 30 days during which time the efficiency of the filter increases and filtration rate declines as schmutzdecke develops although the filtration rate decline was observed neither of the hssfs needed maintenance of the felt blanket or filter media top layer in 63 days of continuous operation reduced presence of microorganisms and nutrients in studied water resulted in a slow schmutzdecke development elliott et al 2008 microcystin lr presence may also lead to the delay in microbiological development due to their ability to alter microbiological communities giaramida et al 2013 and retard the growth of some bacteria miguéns and valério 2015 no evident increases in treatment efficiencies were observed throughout the operation for most of the parameters including m aeruginosa for all filtered samples and microcystin lr for i hssf samples this behaviour was different from that reported in the literature for conventional slow sand filters and hssfs as an increase in treatment efficiencies over time was described cawst 2012 grützmacher et al 2002 ho et al 2007 water quality parameters in filtered water and filter removal rates are presented in table 2 according to the kruskal wallis test there was no significant difference between i hssf 4 h i hssf 12 h and chssf results for m aeruginosa removal p 0 2006 therefore operational conditions such as intermittent and continuous operation different filtration rates and hrt did not influence the removal of m aeruginosa cells studied water m aeruginosa cell density was 1 06 105 1 98 104 cells ml 1 table 2 cell density variations in filtered waters over time are shown in fig 3 the absence of statistical differences between the filters and i hssf hrts could show evidence of the crucial role of grain size in m aeruginosa removal grain size is considered to be critical in hssf design and is able to increase efficiency regardless of conditions such as the hydraulic head influent turbidity and maintenance chan et al 2015 jenkins et al 2011 another critical condition in hssf design reported by jenkins et al 2011 the hrt did not show to be as important in m aeruginosa removal the obtained results are similar to those observed by bojcevska and jergil 2003 the authors observed 99 33 cyanobacteria biomass removal using an hssf feed with water from a lagoon containing large colonies of microcystis botrys and microcystis novacekii further information on filter media characteristics e g d10 and uc and pause periods were not provided in the report microcystis spp behaviour of forming colonies in natural waters is well known holt et al 1994 and it was observed in some episodes through schmutzdecke microscopy analysis fig 4 the presence of large colonies in influent water could increase the filter removal potential due to larger sizes colonies may be more susceptible to physical trapping however laboratory cultivation with controlled conditions resulted in m aeruginosa culture mostly in isolated cells which combined with their small size might have facilitated cyanobacteria passage through the filter media studied water and filtered samples microcystin lr concentrations are shown in fig 5 mean cyanotoxin concentration in studied water was 5 187 2 83 μg l 1 table 2 ranging from 1 00 μg l 1 to 9 99 μg l 1 almost all the filtered water samples presented microcystin lr concentrations below the microcystin kit limit of quantification 0 1 μg l 1 average removal efficiencies were at least 75 30 to i hssf 4 h 76 41 to i hssf 12 h and 74 35 to chssf microcystin lr removal could be attributed mainly to cell retention and biodegradation as proposed in the available literature for conventional slow sand filters chorus et al 2003 eleuterio and batista 2010 grützmacher et al 2005 2002 ho et al 2007 2006 somdee et al 2014 bojcevska and jergil 2003 observed a great influence from inlet microcystin concentrations and water characteristics in hssf removal efficiencies the authors reported removal rates ranging from 20 to 100 using concrete hssf feed with raw water laboratory controlled conditions provided a more constant result in the present research with removal rates ranging from 39 91 to 89 75 for i hssf 4 h and from 39 91 to 89 99 for i hssf 12 h and chssf microcystin lr concentrations are presented in table 3 the influence of the influent microcystin lr concentrations on the removal rates was not as evident as seen by bojcevska and jergil 2003 for all filtered samples cyanotoxin concentrations higher than 1 0 μg l 1 occurred only in four episodes two of those episodes happened for chssf on the first day of operation 2 70 μg l 1 and on the 20th day 1 11 μg l 1 that might show that chssf schmutzdecke development required at least 20 days to biodegrade the influent microcystin lr to a concentration below 1 0 μg l 1 the same behaviour was not observed in samples from i hssf i hssf presented residual microcystin lr concentrations 1 00 μg l 1 since day one for the majority of both pause period samples fig 5 i hssf 4 h presented microcystin lr concentration higher than 1 0 μg l 1 on the 37th and 47th days of operation 1 12 μg l 1 and 2 67 μg l 1 respectively results show that i hssf 12 h presented the most stable behaviour with residual microcystin lr in filtered waters 1 0 μg l 1 throughout the whole operation moreover greater stability can be observed in chssf results when compared to i hssf 4 h while chssf higher microcystin lr concentration episodes happened at the beginning of the operation which was expected since schmutzdecke was not well developed i hssf 4 h higher concentration episodes happened days later the reduced time between feedings which resulted in no pause periods could be the reason for i hssf 4 h instability in the aforementioned case studies with laboratory biological sand filters found that the time required for the biolayer to develop on a sterile sand and efficiently remove microcystin lr could vary from 7 months wang et al 2007 to only 4 days ho et al 2007 2006 in similar conditions such as sand columns microcystin analogues and water source the authors from the aforementioned studies inoculated microcystin in water from a treatment plant with low organic matter concentration likewise the studied water from the present study the wide range of time between the studies are attributed to grain size and extracellular polymeric substances in the sand that could have been facilitated bacteria attachment wang et al 2007 therefore even with a slow schmutzdecke development exposure to the cyanotoxin since day one could have led to the rapid formation of an acclimated microbiological community able to degrade microcystin lr both in chssf and in i hssf in the first days of operation however the biodegradation processes were not well established since schmutzdecke was yet at its earlier stages of development hence biological activity cannot have been responsible for cyanotoxin removal at the beginning of operation although no correlation between cell density and microcystin lr concentration was found the main hypothesis is that cell retention compensates the absence of biodegradation at the beginning of the experiment in the i hssf case according to chorus and bartram 1999 more than 90 of the microcystins in healthy cyanobacterial populations i e cyanobacterial culture which is not in stages of ageing or population decline are intracellular hence cell retention is one of the main removal process in slow sand filters when fed with water containing health cyanobacteria chorus et al 2003 grützmacher et al 2002 considering that studied water was composed of well water inoculated with m aeruginosa culture it is probable that the majority of influent microcystin lr was intracellular therefore able to be removed by cell retention a less likely hypothesis is that extracellular microcystin lr and the sand s first contact resulted in a sorption process removing the cyanotoxin from water even though physical processes were considered negligible when compared to microcystin biodegradation grützmacher et al 2005 2002 ho et al 2007 somdee et al 2014 this explanation for microcystin lr removal through clean sand was proposed grützmacher et al 2005 adsorption on the hssf body might also have happened as a result of pvc capacity to adsorb microcystin codd and bell 1996 the accumulation of toxic cyanobacteria cells inside the filter media due to cell retention can be a concern in the long term cyanobacteria can release intracellular compounds and increase cyanotoxin presence in filtered water during operational time no increase in the microcystin lr concentration was observed in the filtered water which is strong evidence of the biodegradation processes in the filters biodegradation was proposed by jones and orr 1994 and may be the key for the treatment according to the authors microcystin biodegradation was bi phasic indicating the action of at least two different bacteria strains he et al 2016 indicated that bacteria capable of degrading microcystin were described in the literature and currently belong to two phyla proteobacteria and actinobacteria e g sphingomonas sphingomonas sphingopoxyis methylobacillus arthrobacter brevibacterium and rhodococous moreover microbiological communities with previous contact with microcystin can efficiently and quickly degrade this toxin christoffersen et al 2002 although there are few studies focusing on the hssf efficiency to remove cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins it is expected that field studies might present promising results similar to those obtained in our laboratory study however further testing is needed to assess the safety of filtered water over time as a function of the use of natural sources as already mentioned biological activity is one of the main responsible aspects for the degradation of microcystin in slow sand filtration and in hssf bojcevska and jergil 2003 bourne et al 2006 chorus et al 2003 eleuterio and batista 2010 grützmacher et al 2005 2002 ho et al 2007 2006 somdee et al 2014 in field studies chorus et al 2003 evaluated the removal of microcystins during the sediment passage in bank filtration and slow sand filters although the authors expressed concerns about the biodegradation which should be studied they considered sand and soil filtration as promising treatments for microcystin removal furthermore the main removal mechanisms proposed were the retention of intracellular microcystin through physical filtration cell retention and biodegradation of the released extracellular microcystin chorus et al 2003 additionally technologies not related to sand soil passage also highlighted the crucial role of biodegradation in the treatment of microcystin in water wang et al 2007 proposed a dual removal mechanism in granular activated carbon gac filters in two phases phase i adsorption and phase ii adsorption and biodegradation in which biodegradation is the major removal mechanism in phase ii gac columns were inoculated with biofilm from a conventional gac filter and the biodegradation indicated to be dependent on the initial concentration of bacteria inoculated that degraded microcystin and temperature gravity driven membrane gdm filters which are low cost technologies as the hssfs also showed potential to remove microcystin by biodegradation kohler et al 2014 silva et al 2018 although the mechanisms of degradation were not the objective of our study it is believed that biodegradation might be the main removal process that took place in our hssfs besides cell retention it should be noted that low organic matter concentration might influence cyanotoxin removal by biodegradation considering that other carbon sources would compete with microcystin lr as substrate thus biodegradation could be significantly reduced eleuterio and batista 2010 eleuterio and batista 2010 affirmed that the microcystin lr removal by drinking water biofilters depends on cyanotoxin concentration and organic matter availability in our study toc removals table 2 were 11 46 for chssf and 2 55 for i hssf 12 h on the other hand i hssf 4 h presented a 51 57 increase in organic matter when compared to the studied water an increase in organic matter concentrations might have been a result of m aeruginosa lysis inside the filters which generated solubilisation of intercellular composts other than microcystin that were not completely biodegraded which are present in filtered water however according to the kruskal wallis test there was no significant difference between toc in filtered samples and studied water p 0 1213 hssf turbidity removal rates were 81 41 17 03 to i hssf 4 h 83 78 13 60 to i hssf 12 h and 84 39 8 85 to chssf table 2 average removal rates were not as high as reported in the literature which could be attributed to low turbidity in the studied water 1 05 4 36 ntu which eliminated the need to use a pre treatment and justified the long operational time without needing maintenance despite low removal rates i hssf 4 h presented water turbidity below 1 0 ntu in 95 24 of the samples filtered water turbidity below 1 0 ntu in 95 of the samples is associated with a 1 2 log reduction of viruses and 2 5 3 log reduction of cryptosporidium world health organization 2017 for i hssf 12 h and chssf 98 14 and 100 of the samples presented turbidity below 1 0 ntu respectively fig 6 presents turbidity of studied water and filtered water over time filtered water presented some instability on the first 20 days a period in which results over 1 0 ntu were registered after that residual turbidity was more stable for both filters with eventual peaks although there were no evident turbidity decreases in filtered water over time there was a slight increase in removal efficiencies which was more evident for i hssf on the first 20 days in addition to higher instability lower removal rates were observed when compared to the rest of the operation time for both filters removal efficiencies were not significantly different between filter samplings according to the kruskal wallis test p 0 2753 the studied water s mean apparent colour was already below the recommended who limit values 15 uh and therefore all the samples presented an apparent colour within the who recommendations for human consumption removal rates were 91 57 12 23 to i hssf 4 h 95 48 8 15 to i hssf 12 h and 96 37 6 80 for chssf table 2 there was a significant difference between the apparent colour in filtered water p 0 03414 according to the kruskal wallis test the mann whitney test showed that chssf and i hssf 4 h presented significantly different residual apparent colour p 0 01642 i hssf 12 h results were not significantly different from the other samplings m aeruginosa was mainly responsible for attributing colour to studied water therefore cell retention within hssf was mainly responsible for apparent colour removal rates during m aeruginosa growth a strong correlation was found between the apparent colour and cell density however the application of the physical chemical parameter as an m aeruginosa indirect measure could be subject to interference additionally complete apparent colour removal was observed for 49 21 of i hssf 4 h samples 65 08 of ihssf 12 h samples and 68 25 of chssf samples regarding the microbiological risk a low total coliform presence was detected both in the studied water and in the filtered water e coli was not detected in any sample it was observed that total coliforms increase in filtered waters from i hssf 0 041 log to i hssf 4 h and 0 107 log to i hssf 12 h and chssf presented total coliform removal of 0 222 log table 3 hssf coliform removal largely depends on schmutzdecke development elliott et al 2008 jenkins et al 2011 slow maturation may be responsible for the low removal rate to chssf and also increases observed in the i hssf results even when there was an absence of total coliforms in the studied water filtered samples showed the presence of the microorganism in both filters fig 7 this result could be related to coliform accumulation within the filter media without a biolayer developed enough the accumulation was followed by an eventual breakthrough hence a longer operation could improve total coliform removal elliott et al 2015 faria maciel and sabogal paz 2018 the relationship between the filtration rate and coliform breakthrough is reported in the literature higher filtration rates are related to greater presence of faecal coliforms in hssf filtered water elliott et al 2008 i hssf samples were collected right after feeding when the filtration rate was at its highest 2 95 m3 m 2 day 1 the chssf filtration rate remained constant 1 22 m3 m 2 day 1 less than half of the i hssf filtration rate which explains the different results between the filters schmutzdecke microscopy analyses showed an apparent predominance of microorganisms morphologically similar to m aeruginosa for both i hssf and chssf fig 4 in addition to m aeruginosa microorganisms were identified morphologically similar to vorticella sp rotifers nematodes and algae among others for both i hssf and chssf although i hssf presented a greater diversity of microorganisms the chssf biolayer was more developed vorticella sp and nematodes presented greater apparent predominance after m aeruginosa the presence of vorticella sp and rotifers are of special interest as they were reported as predators of the protozoa giardia and cryptosporidium bichai et al 2014 siqueira castro et al 2016 microorganism development was not confined to the felt blanket surface which was also present to a less extent in the filter media surface maintenance would not be limited to the felt blanket washing the filter media top layer would also need maintenance however the felt blanket evidently reduced the biolayer formation in the sand surface which can considerably simplify filter cleaning in events of clogging fig 8 shows sem micrographs of the felt blanket prior to and after using it in both filters fibre overlay is evident after 63 days of operation the adhered material is expected to be composed of extracellular polymeric substances lewandowski and boltz 2011 and trapped materials chssf presented greater fibre coverage than i hssf which can be related to chssf s more robust schmutzdecke i hssf higher filtration rate thus higher shear forces could have led to greater biofilm detachment when compared to chssf results from acute ecotoxicological essays using c xanthus larvae showed that both filters presented mortality rates of 5 6 0 58 in the first test 14 days of operation this corresponds to the death of one of the 18 larvae used in the first assay the control test also showed a mortality rate of 5 6 0 58 however it was the result of one larva developing into the pupa stage and dying probably because of the lack of space to complete its life cycle in the second test 63 days of operation i hssf presented a mortality rate of 5 6 0 58 while chssf presented 0 mortality despite the satisfactory results further studies within this scope are required for more robust determination as to the safety of the filtered water chronic effect tests for example would be a great contribution since the adverse effects of long term exposure to microcystin are commonly reported rastogi et al 2014 4 conclusions full scale hssf presented promising results in the removal of m aeruginosa cells and microcystin lr with the majority of filtered water samples presenting residual microcystin lr concentrations below 1 0 μg l 1 despite the slow development of schmutzdecke both filters produced water with microcystin lr below 1 0 μg l 1 in the first days of operation cell retention within filter media and biodegradation were the most likely mechanisms acting on microcystin lr removal operational differences related to continuous and intermittent operation did not influence filter efficiencies neither did distinct pause periods or filtration rates further research is recommended to better understand hssf behaviour when fed with water containing m aeruginosa cells and microcystin lr especially with natural surface waters in a

19096,a household slow sand filter hssf is a widely used water treatment technology recognized as one of the most effective and sustainable in reducing waterborne diseases however there is a lack of knowledge concerning its behaviour in the presence of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in this context the study aimed to evaluate hssf ability to remove microcystis aeruginosa cells stain bb005 and microcystin lr from water among other parameters when operated under continuous c hssf and intermittent i hssf flows chssf was operated at a constant filtration rate 1 22 m3 m 2 day 1 while i hssf was operated at a variable filtration rate starting at 2 95 m3 m 2 day 1 and finishing at zero each filter produced 60 l day 1 the influence of the pause period was also tested in the i hssf the water from the study was prepared by inoculating m aeruginosa culture in water from a well to a final cell density of 1 105 cells ml 1 m aeruginosa removal rates were 2 39 0 34 log and 2 01 0 43 log by chssf and i hssf respectively microcystin lr concentration in studied water was 5 55 μg l 1 and both filters produced filtered water with microcystin concentrations below 1 0 μg l 1 the maximum value recommended by the world health organization who for most of the samples turbidity and apparent colour were also within who guidelines filters operating with different flow regimes and distinct residence times did not statistically influence treatment efficiencies both filters showed promising results in the m aeruginosa and microcystin lr removals from water nevertheless more research is

the reduction of diarrhoea cases and an increase in quality of life cawst 2012 divelbiss et al 2013 liang et al 2010 additionally hssf presents the ability to be operated in both continuous and intermittent flows young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 although microcystin removal through laboratory biological sand filters and conventional slow sand filters have been reported chorus et al 2003 eleuterio and batista 2010 grützmacher et al 2005 2002 ho et al 2007 2006 somdee et al 2014 there is insufficient understanding about hssf behaviour when fed with water containing cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in this respect a field study investigated hssf efficiency to remove microcystin and lipopolysaccharide endotoxin from natural waters in maputo mozambique bojcevska and jergil 2003 the authors reported microcystin removal efficiency ranging from 20 to 100 however due to low concentrations of microcystin in raw water with the majority of the samples presenting concentrations below 1 0 μg l 1 they were unable to reach a conclusion regarding hssf efficiency to remove microcystin and more studies to confirm the real hssf potential were recommended considering the lack of research on cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin removal in hssf this paper aims to investigate the potential of hssfs made of polyvinyl chloride pvc operating in intermittent and continuous flow regimes in the removal of m aeruginosa cells and microcystin lr 2 materials and methods 2 1 household slow sand filters two full scale hssfs were constructed in opaque pvc using the prototype cawst 2012 as a base model one hssf was designed to operate intermittently i hssf and the other to operate continuously c hssf both filters were constructed with a 250 mm inside diameter cross sectional area 0 049 m2 hssf designs are presented in fig 1 the filter media was a 55 cm fine sand layer with an effective size d10 of 0 153 mm uniformity coefficient uc of 1 68 and porosity of 45 the fine sand layer weight was approximately 39 kg support materials consisted of a 5 cm layer of coarse sand 5 cm layer of fine gravel and 7 5 cm layer of medium gravel materials were washed sun dried and sieved using commercial sieves a non woven synthetic fabric blanket or felt blanket specific gravity 0 2 g cm 3 composition 100 polyester and thickness 2 mm was positioned at the filter media top in order to facilitate hssf operation and maintenance all material used in construction and filling of the hssfs were bought at local stores in são carlos city sp brazil precautions were taken to ensure the use of simple easy to find tools and materials throughout the hssf construction and operation processes 2 2 household slow sand filter operation hssfs were operated for 63 continuous days from november 22 2016 to january 23 2017 the studied water was prepared daily at 8 a m by diluting 1 5 l of m aeruginosa culture into 133 5 l of well water no ph correction was made the preparation provided 135 l of studied water table 1 hssf filtration rates were determined based on the daily water volume needed for activities in a simple residence estimated to be approximately 60 l day 1 the chssf design maintained a steady hydraulic head and its filtration rate was kept constant at 1 22 m3 m 2 day 1 0 04 l min 1 the chssf filtration rate was controlled by a needle valve faucet installed in the outlet pipe on the other hand the i hssf hydraulic head was variable and consequently the filtration rate as well i hssf maximum filtration rate was 2 95 m3 m 2 day 1 0 06 l min 1 right after feeding and it decreased to zero for continuous operation 75 l of the studied water was pumped to an elevated 150 l water tank placed next to the filters a submersible water pump hm 5063 jeneca electromechanical co ltd hong kong was used to maintain a homogeneous mixture inside the water tank a hose connected to the elevated water tank outlet tube conducted the water to the filter studied water entered chssf through a side perforation above the filter media top equipped with a float valve the continuous feeding system was designed to maintain a steady hydraulic head and to equalize the water supply in the chssf avoiding oscillations that could influence the treatment this adaptation resulted in a constant 10 cm hydraulic head the remaining 60 l inside the elevated water tank was used for i hssf feeding there was an extra reservoir coupled to the top of the i hssf constituted by a 13 6 l plastic container with a bottom hole equipped with a plastic float valve a pvc section with 30 cm length and 250 mm diameter was attached to the container in order to increase its working volume studied water was poured into the container and the float valve controlled it entering into i hssf this device was used as a diffuser surrogate with the advantage of being able to control the maximum hydraulic head within the filter it can be observed that the float did not reduce the volume that could be added to the filters it only limited the maximum water level above the standing water and consequently the maximum filtration rate based mainly on a daily household routine i hssf feeding was done four times a day 8 a m 12 p m 4 p m and 8 p m the adopted i hssf water charge intervals resulted in two distinct retention times 4 h between successive feedings and 12 h between the last feeding and the first feeding of the next day charge volume was 15 l the sum of standing water volume and filter media and support layer pore volumes named filter volume each feeding was done transferring the water from the elevated water tank into the i hssf using a plastic container 2 3 tracer tests the chssf and i hssf flow characterizations were carried out using 100 mg l 1 sodium chloride nacl solution as a tracer which was poured into the filters considering the particularities of each design the variation of electric conductivity in the filtered water was detected in real time using a conductivity probe vernier software technology usa positioned at the end of the outlet pipe probe calibration allowed correlating conductivity variation with tracer concentration the data was collected by the software logger lite vernier software technology eua and processed by the software excel 2016 microsoft eua and origin 8 6 originlab eua tracer tests were performed in triplicate in i hssf tracer tests the first feeding was made with nacl solution and the subsequent feedings with well water the filtration rate declined to zero when the hydraulic head reached the minimum level at which time a new charging was performed the volume of each filter charging was the filter volume 15 l the procedure resulted in concentration versus filter volume c vs v curves with a positive step followed by a negative step i e increase in concentration followed by a decrease in concentration i hssf tracer test results were analysed according to those proposed by elliott et al 2008 and bradley 2011 hydraulic retention time hrt was obtained and morrill dispersion index mdi was calculated in accordance with tchobanoglous et al 2003 mdi is the ratio between the time in which 10 and 90 of the tracer exits the filter respectively the index ranges from 1 0 for ideal plug flow rectors to 22 for ideal complete mix reactors in chssf tracer tests the step input was applied for tracer injection as recommended by levenspiel 1999 the filtration rate was the same used during the filter operation 1 22 m3 m 2 day 1 the hrt was determined and concentration versus time c vs t curves were plotted the flow pattern was adjusted into three hydrodynamic mathematical models reported in levenspiel 1999 dispersion models low dispersion and high dispersion and n continuous stirred tank reactors model n cstrs adjusted mathematical models estimated whether the chssf flow pattern resembled a plug flow reactor or n ideal stirred tanks in series mdi was also calculated between each test chssf was cleaned with well water until the nacl solution from the previous test was completely removed 2 4 cyanobacterial culture m aeruginosa cultivation was carried out in an experimental facility the inoculum strain bb005 was supplied by the laboratory of phycology from the federal university of são carlos ufscar brazil cyanobacteria were grown in a batch culture system at wc medium according to guillard and lorenzen 1972 in 2 l erlenmeyer flasks aerated by aquarium pumps before being injected into the culture the air passed through a 0 2 μm porosity polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe filter sartorius stedim usa luminous intensity provided by cool white tubular fluorescent lamps was approximately 60 μmol m 2 s 1 a 12 h photoperiod was applied and the average temperature was 25 2 c to maintain an aseptic environment germicidal lamps were turned on for 15 min prior and after the doors in the experimental facility were opened the subculture was executed inside a laminar flow cabinet the new medium and all the materials were autoclaved and received a uv radiation bath before the procedure the experimental facility provided conditions that allowed maintenance of the needed m aeruginosa suspension volume during the hssf operational period 2 5 sample collection and analysis filtered water samples and studied water samples were collected in 350 ml amber glass bottles the chssf sample collection was performed once a day while the i hssf sample collection was made a few minutes after each water charge i hssf samples were divided by its residence time samples collected at 12 p m 4 p m and 8 p m relative to 8 a m 12 p m and 4 p m water charges respectively with 4 h feeding intervals were collected as a composed sample i hssf 4 h samples collected at 8 a m relative to 8 p m water charge from the day before with 12 h feeding intervals were labelled as i hssf 12 h all the samples were stored in a cold chamber and analysed the day after collection for microcystin lr analyses sample aliquots were frozen in eppendorf tubes with locking caps the microcystin lr determination method used was an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa microcystin plate kit cat 20 0068 beacon eua based on studied water microcystin lr concentrations from previous analyses all the samples were diluted in deionized water at a 1 10 ratio in order to maintain microcystin lr concentration within

counting chamber and bx51 microscope olympus japan moreover monitoring analyses were performed to assure the filters operational stability monitoring analyses were ph dm20 ph meter digimed brazil temperature partial and total alkalinity and conductivity dm32 conductivity meter digimed brazil studied water was also analysed for the aforementioned parameters and i hssf and chssf efficiency were determined as well as their ripening times by the end of the two month operation schmutzdecke samples were collected from the felt blanket and from the filter media s first millimetres the bx51 microscope olympus japan was used to capture images from schmutzdecke microorganisms for visual identification furthermore scanning electron microscope sem zeiss leo 440 cambridge england was used to capture felt blanket photomicrographs before and after operation time in order to visualize potential fibre alterations caused by the development of microorganisms finally acute ecotoxicological assays were performed with chironomus xanthus larvae the aim was to investigate acute toxicity by residual microcystin lr in filtered water or by contact with the filter materials in the assay six 6 c xanthus iv instar larvae were exposed to 250 ml of studied water or filtered water for 96 h after which the number of viable larvae was determined tests were carried out in triplicate in two operational moments at 14 days of operation and at 63 days of operation 1 l samples were taken from each filter for ecotoxicological assays and no composed sample was used the kruskal wallis test was used to compare data from the filtered water samples among each other and with studied water 95 confidence interval when statistical analyses indicated that the mean values were significantly different the mann whitney test was used to determine which sample was significantly different from another 95 confidence interval 3 results and discussion 3 1 tracer tests i hssf tracer tests results are shown in fig 2 a the increase in effluent tracer concentration ranging from 0 mg l 1 to the maximum concentration of 83 mg l 1 occurred on 1 filter volume the same happened when the concentration declined between the second and third filter volumes this behaviour is expected from a plug flow reactor bradley et al 2011 fig 2a also shows that the i hssf effluent tracer concentration 83 mg l 1 did not reach the influent tracer concentration 100 mg l 1 the approximately 27 difference can be attributed to the filter s hydraulic head which may have diluted the tracer solution i hssf hrt was approximately 239 min 3 h and 59 min feeding intervals of 4 h between successive feedings were close to i hssf hrt which resulted in practically no pause period according to cawst 2012 the hssf pause period should not be lower than 1 h or higher than 48 h however cawst s hssf has a maximum filtration rate of 9 6 m3 m 2 day 1 and an hrt of about 1 0 h while the present pvc design operates at a maximum filtration rate of 2 95 m3 m 2 day 1 and almost 4 0 h hrt it was expected that the lower filtration rate compensated the absence of a pause period furthermore a daily genuine household routine was given more attention than the pause period in the decision of feeding intervals for the overnight feeding interval the pause period was 8 h i hssf mdi was 1 88 0 03 slightly higher than some reports in the literature such as elliott et al 2008 who observed an mdi of 1 3 and bradley et al 2011 who obtained an mdi of 1 4 in commercial plastic hssfs hydraid usa however the result obtained was similar to that observed by young rojanschi and madramootoo 2015 who found an mdi value of 1 8 in addition the obtained mdi characterizes the i hssf flow as an effective plug flow reactor according to the usepa classification usepa 1986 the chssf experimental hrt was 417 min 6 h and 57 min used to determine the sample collection time tracer tests c vs t curves are presented in fig 2b the n cstr model better adjusted the chssf flow pattern with an r2 of 0 69 and n 6 the higher the n value is the closer to the plug flow the reactor is levenspiel 1999 chssf mdi was 2 69 0 08 which means that a continuous flow filter could not be considered an effective plug flow reactor according to the usepa classification us environmental protection agency 1986 chssf s low n value and high mdi may not be representative of the flow through filter media itself using a needle faucet to control the flow might have caused water to accumulate on the larger diameter section in the outlet tube leading to the formation of a mixing zone considering that in i hssf the needle faucet does not control its flow there was no water accumulation on the larger diameter section in the outlet tube i e no mixing zone formation which could explain the mdi differences between i hssf and chssf 3 2 household slow sand filter operation both filters maturation ripening were observed to happen slowly according to cawst 2012 the hssf maturation time lasts about 30 days during which time the efficiency of the filter increases and filtration rate declines as schmutzdecke develops although the filtration rate decline was observed neither of the hssfs needed maintenance of the felt blanket or filter media top layer in 63 days of continuous operation reduced presence of microorganisms and nutrients in studied water resulted in a slow schmutzdecke development elliott et al 2008 microcystin lr presence may also lead to the delay in microbiological development due to their ability to alter microbiological communities giaramida et al 2013 and retard the growth of some bacteria miguéns and valério 2015 no evident increases in treatment efficiencies were observed throughout the operation for most of the parameters including m aeruginosa for all filtered samples and microcystin lr for i hssf samples this behaviour was different from that reported in the literature for conventional slow sand filters and hssfs as an increase in treatment efficiencies over time was described cawst 2012 grützmacher et al 2002 ho et al 2007 water quality parameters in filtered water and filter removal rates are presented in table 2 according to the kruskal wallis test there was no significant difference between i hssf 4 h i hssf 12 h and chssf results for m aeruginosa removal p 0 2006 therefore operational conditions such as intermittent and continuous operation different filtration rates and hrt did not influence the removal of m aeruginosa cells studied water m aeruginosa cell density was 1 06 105 1 98 104 cells ml 1 table 2 cell density variations in filtered waters over time are shown in fig 3 the absence of statistical differences between the filters and i hssf hrts could show evidence of the crucial role of grain size in m aeruginosa removal grain size is considered to be critical in hssf design and is able to increase efficiency regardless of conditions such as the hydraulic head influent turbidity and maintenance chan et al 2015 jenkins et al 2011 another critical condition in hssf design reported by jenkins et al 2011 the hrt did not show to be as important in m aeruginosa removal the obtained results are similar to those observed by bojcevska and jergil 2003 the authors observed 99 33 cyanobacteria biomass removal using an hssf feed with water from a lagoon containing large colonies of microcystis botrys and microcystis novacekii further information on filter media characteristics e g d10 and uc and pause periods were not provided in the report microcystis spp behaviour of forming colonies in natural waters is well known holt et al 1994 and it was observed in some episodes through schmutzdecke microscopy analysis fig 4 the presence of large colonies in influent water could increase the filter removal potential due to larger sizes colonies may be more susceptible to physical trapping however laboratory cultivation with controlled conditions resulted in m aeruginosa culture mostly in isolated cells which combined with their small size might have facilitated cyanobacteria passage through the filter media studied water and filtered samples microcystin lr concentrations are shown in fig 5 mean cyanotoxin concentration in studied water was 5 187 2 83 μg l 1 table 2 ranging from 1 00 μg l 1 to 9 99 μg l 1 almost all the filtered water samples presented microcystin lr concentrations below the microcystin kit limit of quantification 0 1 μg l 1 average removal efficiencies were at least 75 30 to i hssf 4 h 76 41 to i hssf 12 h and 74 35 to chssf microcystin lr removal could be attributed mainly to cell retention and biodegradation as proposed in the available literature for conventional slow sand filters chorus et al 2003 eleuterio and batista 2010 grützmacher et al 2005 2002 ho et al 2007 2006 somdee et al 2014 bojcevska and jergil 2003 observed a great influence from inlet microcystin concentrations and water characteristics in hssf removal efficiencies the authors reported removal rates ranging from 20 to 100 using concrete hssf feed with raw water laboratory controlled conditions provided a more constant result in the present research with removal rates ranging from 39 91 to 89 75 for i hssf 4 h and from 39 91 to 89 99 for i hssf 12 h and chssf microcystin lr concentrations are presented in table 3 the influence of the influent microcystin lr concentrations on the removal rates was not as evident as seen by bojcevska and jergil 2003 for all filtered samples cyanotoxin concentrations higher than 1 0 μg l 1 occurred only in four episodes two of those episodes happened for chssf on the first day of operation 2 70 μg l 1 and on the 20th day 1 11 μg l 1 that might show that chssf schmutzdecke development required at least 20 days to biodegrade the influent microcystin lr to a concentration below 1 0 μg l 1 the same behaviour was not observed in samples from i hssf i hssf presented residual microcystin lr concentrations 1 00 μg l 1 since day one for the majority of both pause period samples fig 5 i hssf 4 h presented microcystin lr concentration higher than 1 0 μg l 1 on the 37th and 47th days of operation 1 12 μg l 1 and 2 67 μg l 1 respectively results show that i hssf 12 h presented the most stable behaviour with residual microcystin lr in filtered waters 1 0 μg l 1 throughout the whole operation moreover greater stability can be observed in chssf results when compared to i hssf 4 h while chssf higher microcystin lr concentration episodes happened at the beginning of the operation which was expected since schmutzdecke was not well developed i hssf 4 h higher concentration episodes happened days later the reduced time between feedings which resulted in no pause periods could be the reason for i hssf 4 h instability in the aforementioned case studies with laboratory biological sand filters found that the time required for the biolayer to develop on a sterile sand and efficiently remove microcystin lr could vary from 7 months wang et al 2007 to only 4 days ho et al 2007 2006 in similar conditions such as sand columns microcystin analogues and water source the authors from the aforementioned studies inoculated microcystin in water from a treatment plant with low organic matter concentration likewise the studied water from the present study the wide range of time between the studies are attributed to grain size and extracellular polymeric substances in the sand that could have been facilitated bacteria attachment wang et al 2007 therefore even with a slow schmutzdecke development exposure to the cyanotoxin since day one could have led to the rapid formation of an acclimated microbiological community able to degrade microcystin lr both in chssf and in i hssf in the first days of operation however the biodegradation processes were not well established since schmutzdecke was yet at its earlier stages of development hence biological activity cannot have been responsible for cyanotoxin removal at the beginning of operation although no correlation between cell density and microcystin lr concentration was found the main hypothesis is that cell retention compensates the absence of biodegradation at the beginning of the experiment in the i hssf case according to chorus and bartram 1999 more than 90 of the microcystins in healthy cyanobacterial populations i e cyanobacterial culture which is not in stages of ageing or population decline are intracellular hence cell retention is one of the main removal process in slow sand filters when fed with water containing health cyanobacteria chorus et al 2003 grützmacher et al 2002 considering that studied water was composed of well water inoculated with m aeruginosa culture it is probable that the majority of influent microcystin lr was intracellular therefore able to be removed by cell retention a less likely hypothesis is that extracellular microcystin lr and the sand s first contact resulted in a sorption process removing the cyanotoxin from water even though physical processes were considered negligible when compared to microcystin biodegradation grützmacher et al 2005 2002 ho et al 2007 somdee et al 2014 this explanation for microcystin lr removal through clean sand was proposed grützmacher et al 2005 adsorption on the hssf body might also have happened as a result of pvc capacity to adsorb microcystin codd and bell 1996 the accumulation of toxic cyanobacteria cells inside the filter media due to cell retention can be a concern in the long term cyanobacteria can release intracellular compounds and increase cyanotoxin presence in filtered water during operational time no increase in the microcystin lr concentration was observed in the filtered water which is strong evidence of the biodegradation processes in the filters biodegradation was proposed by jones and orr 1994 and may be the key for the treatment according to the authors microcystin biodegradation was bi phasic indicating the action of at least two different bacteria strains he et al 2016 indicated that bacteria capable of degrading microcystin were described in the literature and currently belong to two phyla proteobacteria and actinobacteria e g sphingomonas sphingomonas sphingopoxyis methylobacillus arthrobacter brevibacterium and rhodococous moreover microbiological communities with previous contact with microcystin can efficiently and quickly degrade this toxin christoffersen et al 2002 although there are few studies focusing on the hssf efficiency to remove cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins it is expected that field studies might present promising results similar to those obtained in our laboratory study however further testing is needed to assess the safety of filtered water over time as a function of the use of natural sources as already mentioned biological activity is one of the main responsible aspects for the degradation of microcystin in slow sand filtration and in hssf bojcevska and jergil 2003 bourne et al 2006 chorus et al 2003 eleuterio and batista 2010 grützmacher et al 2005 2002 ho et al 2007 2006 somdee et al 2014 in field studies chorus et al 2003 evaluated the removal of microcystins during the sediment passage in bank filtration and slow sand filters although the authors expressed concerns about the biodegradation which should be studied they considered sand and soil filtration as promising treatments for microcystin removal furthermore the main removal mechanisms proposed were the retention of intracellular microcystin through physical filtration cell retention and biodegradation of the released extracellular microcystin chorus et al 2003 additionally technologies not related to sand soil passage also highlighted the crucial role of biodegradation in the treatment of microcystin in water wang et al 2007 proposed a dual removal mechanism in granular activated carbon gac filters in two phases phase i adsorption and phase ii adsorption and biodegradation in which biodegradation is the major removal mechanism in phase ii gac columns were inoculated with biofilm from a conventional gac filter and the biodegradation indicated to be dependent on the initial concentration of bacteria inoculated that degraded microcystin and temperature gravity driven membrane gdm filters which are low cost technologies as the hssfs also showed potential to remove microcystin by biodegradation kohler et al 2014 silva et al 2018 although the mechanisms of degradation were not the objective of our study it is believed that biodegradation might be the main removal process that took place in our hssfs besides cell retention it should be noted that low organic matter concentration might influence cyanotoxin removal by biodegradation considering that other carbon sources would compete with microcystin lr as substrate thus biodegradation could be significantly reduced eleuterio and batista 2010 eleuterio and batista 2010 affirmed that the microcystin lr removal by drinking water biofilters depends on cyanotoxin concentration and organic matter availability in our study toc removals table 2 were 11 46 for chssf and 2 55 for i hssf 12 h on the other hand i hssf 4 h presented a 51 57 increase in organic matter when compared to the studied water an increase in organic matter concentrations might have been a result of m aeruginosa lysis inside the filters which generated solubilisation of intercellular composts other than microcystin that were not completely biodegraded which are present in filtered water however according to the kruskal wallis test there was no significant difference between toc in filtered samples and studied water p 0 1213 hssf turbidity removal rates were 81 41 17 03 to i hssf 4 h 83 78 13 60 to i hssf 12 h and 84 39 8 85 to chssf table 2 average removal rates were not as high as reported in the literature which could be attributed to low turbidity in the studied water 1 05 4 36 ntu which eliminated the need to use a pre treatment and justified the long operational time without needing maintenance despite low removal rates i hssf 4 h presented water turbidity below 1 0 ntu in 95 24 of the samples filtered water turbidity below 1 0 ntu in 95 of the samples is associated with a 1 2 log reduction of viruses and 2 5 3 log reduction of cryptosporidium world health organization 2017 for i hssf 12 h and chssf 98 14 and 100 of the samples presented turbidity below 1 0 ntu respectively fig 6 presents turbidity of studied water and filtered water over time filtered water presented some instability on the first 20 days a period in which results over 1 0 ntu were registered after that residual turbidity was more stable for both filters with eventual peaks although there were no evident turbidity decreases in filtered water over time there was a slight increase in removal efficiencies which was more evident for i hssf on the first 20 days in addition to higher instability lower removal rates were observed when compared to the rest of the operation time for both filters removal efficiencies were not significantly different between filter samplings according to the kruskal wallis test p 0 2753 the studied water s mean apparent colour was already below the recommended who limit values 15 uh and therefore all the samples presented an apparent colour within the who recommendations for human consumption removal rates were 91 57 12 23 to i hssf 4 h 95 48 8 15 to i hssf 12 h and 96 37 6 80 for chssf table 2 there was a significant difference between the apparent colour in filtered water p 0 03414 according to the kruskal wallis test the mann whitney test showed that chssf and i hssf 4 h presented significantly different residual apparent colour p 0 01642 i hssf 12 h results were not significantly different from the other samplings m aeruginosa was mainly responsible for attributing colour to studied water therefore cell retention within hssf was mainly responsible for apparent colour removal rates during m aeruginosa growth a strong correlation was found between the apparent colour and cell density however the application of the physical chemical parameter as an m aeruginosa indirect measure could be subject to interference additionally complete apparent colour removal was observed for 49 21 of i hssf 4 h samples 65 08 of ihssf 12 h samples and 68 25 of chssf samples regarding the microbiological risk a low total coliform presence was detected both in the studied water and in the filtered water e coli was not detected in any sample it was observed that total coliforms increase in filtered waters from i hssf 0 041 log to i hssf 4 h and 0 107 log to i hssf 12 h and chssf presented total coliform removal of 0 222 log table 3 hssf coliform removal largely depends on schmutzdecke development elliott et al 2008 jenkins et al 2011 slow maturation may be responsible for the low removal rate to chssf and also increases observed in the i hssf results even when there was an absence of total coliforms in the studied water filtered samples showed the presence of the microorganism in both filters fig 7 this result could be related to coliform accumulation within the filter media without a biolayer developed enough the accumulation was followed by an eventual breakthrough hence a longer operation could improve total coliform removal elliott et al 2015 faria maciel and sabogal paz 2018 the relationship between the filtration rate and coliform breakthrough is reported in the literature higher filtration rates are related to greater presence of faecal coliforms in hssf filtered water elliott et al 2008 i hssf samples were collected right after feeding when the filtration rate was at its highest 2 95 m3 m 2 day 1 the chssf filtration rate remained constant 1 22 m3 m 2 day 1 less than half of the i hssf filtration rate which explains the different results between the filters schmutzdecke microscopy analyses showed an apparent predominance of microorganisms morphologically similar to m aeruginosa for both i hssf and chssf fig 4 in addition to m aeruginosa microorganisms were identified morphologically similar to vorticella sp rotifers nematodes and algae among others for both i hssf and chssf although i hssf presented a greater diversity of microorganisms the chssf biolayer was more developed vorticella sp and nematodes presented greater apparent predominance after m aeruginosa the presence of vorticella sp and rotifers are of special interest as they were reported as predators of the protozoa giardia and cryptosporidium bichai et al 2014 siqueira castro et al 2016 microorganism development was not confined to the felt blanket surface which was also present to a less extent in the filter media surface maintenance would not be limited to the felt blanket washing the filter media top layer would also need maintenance however the felt blanket evidently reduced the biolayer formation in the sand surface which can considerably simplify filter cleaning in events of clogging fig 8 shows sem micrographs of the felt blanket prior to and after using it in both filters fibre overlay is evident after 63 days of operation the adhered material is expected to be composed of extracellular polymeric substances lewandowski and boltz 2011 and trapped materials chssf presented greater fibre coverage than i hssf which can be related to chssf s more robust schmutzdecke i hssf higher filtration rate thus higher shear forces could have led to greater biofilm detachment when compared to chssf results from acute ecotoxicological essays using c xanthus larvae showed that both filters presented mortality rates of 5 6 0 58 in the first test 14 days of operation this corresponds to the death of one of the 18 larvae used in the first assay the control test also showed a mortality rate of 5 6 0 58 however it was the result of one larva developing into the pupa stage and dying probably because of the lack of space to complete its life cycle in the second test 63 days of operation i hssf presented a mortality rate of 5 6 0 58 while chssf presented 0 mortality despite the satisfactory results further studies within this scope are required for more robust determination as to the safety of the filtered water chronic effect tests for example would be a great contribution since the adverse effects of long term exposure to microcystin are commonly reported rastogi et al 2014 4 conclusions full scale hssf presented promising results in the removal of m aeruginosa cells and microcystin lr with the majority of filtered water samples presenting residual microcystin lr concentrations below 1 0 μg l 1 despite the slow development of schmutzdecke both filters produced water with microcystin lr below 1 0 μg l 1 in the first days of operation cell retention within filter media and biodegradation were the most likely mechanisms acting on microcystin lr removal operational differences related to continuous and intermittent operation did not influence filter efficiencies neither did distinct pause periods or filtration rates further research is recommended to better understand hssf behaviour when fed with water containing m aeruginosa cells and microcystin lr especially with natural surface waters in a long term operation and after events such as maintenance and flow stoppages mechanisms involved in the removal of both cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin intra and extracellular by hssf i e contributions of sand sorption and cellular retention still need specific studies statement the authors hereby declare previous originality check no conflict of interest and open access to the repository of data used

19097,mesophilic batch anaerobic digesters fed by different substrates were set up to identify the role of substrate rheology in anaerobic digestion performance while operating below the toxic level five substrates of different rheological behaviour but at the same amount of organic matters were prepared by addition of different amount of an inert material 0 0 03 0 07 0 11 and 0 20 g per g of waste activated sludge was to gain a comprehensive insight the interactive relationship between substrate rheology physico chemical properties and biogas production as well as digestate dewaterability was investigated the results proved that better access of microorganisms to organic matters improved the digester performance and led to 19 29 and 12 5 increase in biogas yield and vs removal efficiency respectively moreover the statistical analysis showed that consistency index and loss modulus of sludge could be employed as promising indications for biogas yield while yield stress could predict dewaterability of digestate as far as the other physico chemical properties remained unchanged during digestion measurement of consistency index and loss modulus of digestate could be performed as a reliable tool to monitor biogas production graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion biogas production dewaterability substrate rheology physico chemical properties 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad of sludge has been an increasingly attractive solution for wastewater treatment plants or local authorities willing to meet their environmental commitment enormous attempts have been made to improve the operation of this critical piece of waste management industry however economic sustainability of this technology is still being criticised by the investors who advocate that biogas rate generated by this process may fall under its operational and development cost akta and cecen 2001 girault et al 2012 as both digester homogenisation and gas extraction lean on sludge consistency and structural characteristics rheology of sludge affects the function and efficiency of anaerobic degradation dieudé fauvel et al 2014 therefore investigation of the role of sludge rheology in ad performance can help improving biogas production waste activated sludge is mostly in the form of extracellular polymeric substances a high molecular weight mixture of polymers this structure keeps microbial aggregates together in a three dimensional matrix affecting biodegradability hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and fluidity of was sheng et al 2010 liu et al 2016 as sludge solid concentrations increase this polymeric structure become stronger and affect sludge viscosity and its fluidity and lead to several consequences such as short circuiting substrate in the reactor or formation of stagnant regions which reduces effective reactor volume and substrate contact with the active micro organisms all of these can result in decreased mass transfer and heat transfer rate preventing the influent sludge temperature to reach the operating temperature of the biogas fermenter and consequently impacting bioreaction rate o neil 1985 in summary rheological behaviour of sludge has a key role to play in heat and mass transfer during conversion of biomass to methane through anaerobic digestion as rheological behaviour is affected by physico chemical properties the interactive relationship between rheological and physico chemical properties should be investigated zhang et al 2016 argued that there was a strong linear relationship between the storage modulus g and total organic concentration forster 1983 2002 discovered that yield stress had a logarithmic relationship with both bound water bw and surface charge similarly surface charge and hydrophobicity had a part to play in flocculation settling and dewatering shin et al 2000 a linear relationship between elastic modulus and compactness of sludge dewaterability during ad was found by zhang et al 2018 and poor dewaterability of highly viscous sludge li and yang 2007 however there is a lack of comprehensive research on the inherent interaction between degradability physico chemistry and rheology to further determine whether rheological parameters are able to describe the performance of anaerobic digesters including both biogas yield and dewaterability while the rheological properties of sludge during digestion have been broadly studied no consensus has yet been reached in respect to the specific role of the rheology of substrate on degradability and biogas production in addition to date no link has been found between dewaterability of digestate and rheological behaviour of substrate the aim of this work is to develop a correlation to link biogas yield and dewaterability of digestate to substrate rheology this work also investigates the inherent interaction between degradability physico chemistry and rheology to further determine whether rheological parameters are able to reflect the performance of anaerobic digesters 2 material and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge and inoculum digested sludge ds as inoculum and waste activated sludge was as an original substrate were both collected in early march autumn season from eastern treatment plant victoria australia ds and was containers were transferred to the lab on the same day of collection and stored at 37 c and 4 c respectively upon arrival both sludge characteristics then were tested as they were fresh and reported in table 1 2 2 addition of an inert component to was to prepare substrate of different rheological properties almost all the materials have potential biogas production to some extent making it difficult to disentangle the role of rheology and chemistry of sludge by adding co substrate in this work the addition of an inert material to was could assist preparing rheologically different substrates of the same chemistry and organic matters content to achieve this poly methyl methacrylate pmma powder supplied by sigma aldrich also known as acrylic was used the chemical structure and properties of pmma were studied and presented in table 2 to make sure that pmma has no interference to the chemical tests scod concentration of different blends of pmma and demineralized water was tested the scod results for blends of pmma and demineralized water were the same as the blank sample showing that there was no oxidation reaction between this component and the oxidant reagent as well as no organic matters were added to samples by addition of this powder these results verified that polymeric powder cannot be digestible by microorganism during digestion the absence of nitrogen group in the chemical structure of this polymer also will undoubtedly cause no fingerprint on the ammonia concentration results due to the reduction of tensile strength of this polymer by increased water absorption ishiyama et al 2005 in all organic testing centrifugation was avoided and instead all samples were filtered by 0 45 μm filter syringe to get liquor for the chemical tests the substantially larger particle size of this polymeric powder 48 μm compared to the porosity of the syringe filter 0 45 μm guaranteed that powder does not pass through 2 3 preparation of the feeding substrates of different digesters substrate was was mixed with different dose of an inorganic matter pmma to produce substrates of the same organic content but different flow behaviour different amounts of pmma powder 0 03 0 07 0 11 and 0 20 g g was were added to prepare substrates of different rheological properties for digesters b c d e while digester a which had no pmma was used as control pmma was blends were stirred at 300 rpm for 20 min to assure a well homogenised mixture flow curves and detailed herschel bulkley model parameters of the different substrates are shown in fig 1 a and fig 1b respectively the storage modulus g and loss modulus g as a function of applied strain are plotted in fig 1c the influence of pmma powder on sludge rheological parameters can be explained by modified particle interaction you et al 2018 considering that the isoelectric point of bacteria is at ph 2 4 at ph above isoelectric sludge ph is 6 5 in this work charges on surfaces of the sludge particle will be negative addition of pmma reduced the zeta potential of mixture as pmma particles carry positive zeta potential at this ph falahati et al 2014 this phenomenon decreased repulsion between flocs and caused shrinkage of flocs matrix leading to a better flow due to reduction of the exposed cross sectional area sanin 2002 for this reason the viscosity yield stress consistency index and viscoelastic parameters of substrate of the digester b and c pmma up to 0 07 g g was are lower compared to was without powder however addition of pmma above 0 07 g g was increased rheological properties of substrate of the digesters d and e due to increase in solids particles which was more effective on rheological behaviour compared to the impact of surface charge no effect of digestion was expected on the results because the measurement was undertaken immediately after mixing of was and pmma to sum up flow consistency of substrate in digester c had a lower value compared to the other cases which resulted a better fluidity of this substrate repeating all these tests for the mixture of each substrate with inoculum led to observation similar to fig 1 summarized in table 3 table 3 shows the details of the prepared substrates assuming that amount of organic matters in the control were equal to those in the other digesters this speculation was reasonable as all digesters were fed by the same amount of organic matters moreover scod for all digesters including pmma powder was close to that of the control digester which well confirmed that pmma was an inorganic matter implying the same organic matters in all cases 2 4 experimental design and set up to assess the impact of different substrate rheology on anaerobic digester performance five different groups of digesters were fed with five different substrates having different rheology but the same amount of organic matters content in all cases 55 ml of substrate was added to 75 ml of inoculum in 250 ml serum bottles based on the substrate inoculum ratio of 1 1 vs basis ho et al 2013 all bottles were flushed with nitrogen gas for 1 min chen et al 2018 and sealed immediately with rubber suba seal 16 mm sigma aldrich before incubating in a shaker at 100 rpm 37 1 c for 30 days ten serum bottles were used for each batch a e to periodically assess the changes in properties and biogas yield during anaerobic digestion two bottles containing the inoculum and no substrate were used to correct background methane potential of the added inoculum 2 5 degradability and digester performance periodically two bottles of each batch were collected from the incubator to analyse the sludge behaviour on different days of digestion the sludge samples were collected in sealed tubes which were quickly cooled by dipping in an ice bath to assess degradability and digester performance biogas volume total solids ts volatile solids vs total chemical oxygen demand tcod and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were measured water displacement method was used to measure daily gas production in this method the increase of water level pushed by the gas is equivalent to the biogas volume in ml ts and vs were measured using method 1684 provided by the u s environmental protection agency epa 2010 sludge sample was dried in the oven at 105 c for 24h until reaching constant weight to avoid absorbing water the residue was immediately kept in the desiccator to reach room temperature the ratio of dried solid over wet sample weight was calculated as ts burning the residue at 550 c for 2h hosnani et al 2010 vs was calculated after deducting the weight of ash from initial dried solids weight and then dividing by dried solids weight to analyse scod particulate materials were removed by filtration through syringe filter 0 45 μm for tcod suspension samples were diluted 41 times with deionized water before oxidation by reagent in such a way that the dilution factor was constant for every sample chemical oxygen demand measurement was performed using hach procedure cod high range plus reagents dr5000 spectrophotometer and drb200 digester all the experimental tests were duplicated and conducted on the day of sampling to eliminate the storage effect 2 6 inhibitory by products to assess inhibition factors in the digesters ph level and ammonia concentration were periodically monitored ph was measured using a calibrated ph meter thermoorion model 550a and ammonia concentration was tested by colorimetric techniques using a hach spectrophotometer model dr 4000 u according to the method 10031 for the analysis of ammonia particulate materials were removed by centrifugation at 10000 rpm 13000 g for 5 min followed by syringe filter 0 45 μm the filtrate was then diluted 41 times with deionized water before adding to the reagent 2 7 physico chemical properties surface characteristics was analysed by zeta potential using zetasizer from malvern instrument due to the problem of sludge settlement in the measurement cell tixier et al 2003 all samples were centrifuged at 10000 rpm 13000 g for 5 min before adding to disposable folded capillary cells dts1070 all measurements were relied on the interaction of the particles in the filtrate bound water was measured using differential scanning calorimeter dsc ta instrument grounded on the assumption that up to 20 c all the free water freezes whilst the bound water does not colin and gazbar 1995 in each test 20 mg sludge was cooled from 20 c to 20 c at a cooling rate of 5 c min peeters et al 2013 and then increased to 20 c at the same rate while the released heat during freezing of water was recorded the bound water content for each test was then determined by eq 1 1 w b w t δ h δ h o where wt g g dry sludge is the quotient of total water and dry sludge 105 c overnight δh j g is the exothermic area and δho 334 7 j g is the standard fusion heat of water perry and green 1984 2 8 settleability and dewaterability settling characteristics was analysed by measuring gravity settled volume in ml occupied by 1 g of a sludge suspension after 30 min in graduated cylinders sludge volume index svi was then calculated by eq 2 zhuang et al 2017 2 s v i 100 h 30 h 0 x 0 where h30 cm is the height of sludge sample after 30 min h0 cm is the initial height of sludge and x0 is the solids concentration of sludge the centrifugal dewatering hidaka et al 2013 was used to evaluate the dewaterability of sludge because this method is known to be a reliable alternative to the filterability measurement constant pressure filtration to analyse compressibility and permeability loginov et al 2016 40 ml of digested sludge samples were centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min hidaka et al 2013 sludge cake was then weighed before drying at 105 c overnight water content of dewatered sludge cake was calculated from the difference of dried sludge and initial cake weight as below zhuang et al 2017 3 w c 1 m d r i e d s l u d g e m s l u d g e c a k e 100 where mdried sludge g is the weight of the dried sludge and msludge cake g is the weight of the sludge cake after centrifugation 2 9 rheological measurement rheological measurements were performed using stress controlled rheometer dhr3 ta instruments connected to a temperature controlled water bath to eliminate the interference of particles inside sludge suspension in rheology results wide gap geometry was preferred for rheological measurement with cup and grooved bob bob diameter 15 mm cup diameter 30 mm bob length 44 mm in each test 30 ml of sludge sample was taken into the rheometer cup all rheological tests were carried out with the following procedure to erase material memory and have reproducible measurements sample were pre sheared for 150 s at 300 1 s baudez et al 2013 followed by 5 min equilibrium at zero shear rate following equilibrium time viscoelastic properties of sludge were measured first viscoelastic materials such as sludge showed a combination of solid like and liquid like behaviour which were defined as storage and loss moduli g g respectively deborah and de 2008 to investigate the viscoelastic characteristics amplitude sweep oscillation tests were conducted through which an increasing ramp of strain from 1 to 300 at constant frequency of 1 hz was applied with collecting 30 points per decade to determine the flow behaviour stress sweep test was performed through which a decreasing ramp of shear rate from 300 to 1s 1 was applied with collecting 10 points per decade in all the rheological tests temperature was kept at 25 c for conical cylinder cup and bob geometry the shear stress pa exerted on the bob can be related to the torque as eq 4 estellé et al 2008 4 τ b m m 2 π h r b 2 where m is the torque n m h the length of bob m and rb is the radius of bob m for a gap in which rc rb rb the shear rate 1 s at the bob surface is then calculated using krieger s method estellé et al 2008 5 γ b 2 ω n α 2 n α 2 n 1 where ω is the angular velocity rad s α is the ratio of cup radius to bob radius and n is the derivative of ln τb with respect to ln ω herschel bulkley model eq 6 has been known as an accurate model for developing flow behaviour profile of sludge eshtiaghi et al 2012 6 τ τ y k γ n where τy is the yield stress pa k is the consistency index pa sn and n is the flow behaviour index to develop the flow curves shear stress and shear rate of all samples were recalculated and then fitted to the herschel bulkley model using eqs 4 6 respectively 2 10 statistical analysis statistical analysis for the anaerobic digesters performance was performed with minitab 18 and ibm spss software minitab was used to generate a response surface methodology rsm model between the studied parameters this statistical tool formulated a mathematical equation to describe the correlation of the rheological parameters with biogas production during digestion ibm spss software was used to determine the linear correlation between two variables using pearson s correlation coefficient the correlations were considered statistically significant at 95 confidence interval p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of rheology on degradability and biogas production this part compares the performance of digesters a e to investigate how substrate consistency can affect degradability of the substrate during anaerobic digestion to analyse the performance of the digesters organic matter removal during the digestion period was calculated basically during the first 21 days of sludge digestion most of the readily degradable organic matters are consumed reaching the plateau for the next days the trend is because the remaining proteins and carbohydrates are recalcitrant and could not be well consumed by microorganisms yang et al 2015 fig 2 compares the degradability and biogas yield of the different digesters over 30 day anaerobic digestion as the deviations of biogas production and degradability of replicate digesters were less than 7 mean values are reported in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 sludge of the lowest viscosity in digester c led to higher amount of biogas which was in coincidence with highest degree of vs degradation compared to the other digesters on the second day of digestion volatile solids removal in digester c was approximately double that of digester b and four and five times higher than d and e biogas production during the following 17 days in digester a b and c sharply soared to about 189 2 208 5 230 4 ml gvsadded respectively and then enhanced slowly towards the end of the process to reach a steady state in contrast a slower biogas yield growth was seen in the first three weeks for digesters d and e which then reached steady state to about 169 5 and 155 8 ml gvsadded at day 30 to sum up digester c was superior to the other cases over the whole period of the process ranked for 19 29 more biogas compared to the control digester while there was only 9 52 biogas yield rise in digester b in contrast 14 18 and 21 14 biogas yield drop were observed in digester d and e compared to the control digester respectively 3 2 impact of rheology on solubilisation anaerobic digestion performance can also be reflected by cod reduction total cod contains the amount of main organic matters such as carbohydrates proteins and lipids while soluble cod holds dissolved part of tcod meaning easily degradable portion fig 3 compares the released scod of was in each digester after two days digestion as can be seen higher amount of scod was released in the digester c fed by substrate of the lowest viscosity compared to other cases fig 4 shows the reduction of soluble cod as a function of digestion time similarly the dissolved organic matters were faster consumed in digester c but digesters b d and e could not decompose as much particulate organic matters compared to digester c this observation is well supported by the volatile solids reduction results in fig 2 where digester b d and e showed lower degradability compared to digester c 3 3 no inhibitory by products production during digestion during the digestion process ph for all digesters fig 5 a across all digestion days remained between the range of 6 8 7 8 favourable for the survival of microorganism yang et al 2015 also decomposition of protein produces ammonia that can act as an inhibitory compound ammonia concentration fig 5b for all cases was below 1200 mg l the toxic level reported by jan moestedt et al 2016a so the poor performance of the digesters in terms of organic matter degradation and biogas production is not due to process inhibition 3 4 the link between substrate rheological parameters and biogas production plotting cumulative biogas yield after 30 day digestion as a function of consistency yield stress g and g in fig 6 shows that biogas production increases as these rheological parameters decrease a possible explanation can be the improved fluid transfer and easier access to the food for microorganisms provided by better flowability j moestedt et al 2016b thus mass transfer between organic matters and microorganisms promoted resulting in increased biogas yield the poor degradability and biogas production as a result of poor fluidity might be as a result of formation of stagnant regions and accumulation of sludge due to poor response to being sheared properly on the first days of digestion this observation is well supported by the volatile solids reduction results in fig 2 where digester d and e showed less degradability compared to the other cases plotting cumulative biogas yield after 30 day digestion as a function of rheological parameters of substrate of different digesters in fig 6 the trend pinpoints that the more the fluid like behaviour in the substrate the higher the production of biogas this result revealed that the substrate rheology has a key role to play in biogas yield minitab 18 was used for analysis of variance anova with general linear regression analyses of the data with 95 confidence applying the anova technique the less significant terms with probability value p value 0 05 table 4 were removed from the equations with not much change in the precision of the correlation the final equations of biogas production as a function of rheological behaviour are as follow 7 biogas ml vs added 274 03 162 73 k pa sn 8 biogas ml vs added 637 50 161 76 g pa therefore consistency index and loss modulus of sludge are the most significant rheological parameters effective on biogas production 3 5 impact of rheology on dewaterability in this part settleability and compressibility of digestates are compared to see how better fluidity can effect dewaterability of the final product of anaerobic digestion in anaerobic digestion the eps content in the sludge is one of the main characteristics that may affect the dewaterability of the sludge high eps content may increase the viscosity of the sludge that would result in difficulty in dewaterability li and yang 2007 as there are many charged functional groups in eps they have been shown to have physico chemical interactions such as electrostatic hydrophobic van der waals and hydrogen bonding geyik et al 2016 as well as adsorption biosorption wang et al 2014 among these surface charge and hydrophobicity have received a lot of attention regarding their dramatic impacts on important properties of sludge such as flocculation settling dewatering shin et al 2000 because of digestion eps transfers from particles into the bulk fluid making the flow easier and increases the functional group and surface charge of the bulk fluid fig 7 shows potential difference between the dispersion medium and the stationary layer of fluid attached to the dispersed particle by zeta potential as can be seen negative value of zeta potential in digester c is higher than other cases which is due to higher degradation higher negative charge led to less settled volume which was in a good agreement with deterioration of flocculation at more negative values of zeta potential li et al 2016 sludge volume index svi of digestate on day 30 was also calculated to realize how much volume per gram dried solids settled after a certain time as shown in fig 7 comparable settleability of the digestates from different digesters was consistent with the zeta potential values except for digesters d and e as the correlation between zeta potential and svi has been found unreliable by zhang et al 2015 settleability is not going to be the only factor affecting the sludge dewatering yin et al 2004 so bound water bw and water content in final cake after centrifuging dewatering were also measured as it can be seen digester c with substrate of lower viscosity demonstrated less amount of bound water on the last day of digestion it is perhaps because of the greater release of water from intracellular materials during flocs destruction dai et al 2014 bw in sludge structure acts as a resistance to compression forster 2002 the smaller the bw content the more solids could be compressed resulting in squeezing more free moisture out kopp and dichtl 2001 lower water content wc of digester c fig 7 confirmed the low amount of water trapped in sludge structure on the last day of digestion because bw could not be discharged by mechanical devices such as centrifuge the correlation between bound water and rheological behaviour was analysed the same approach as section 3 4 and the final equation is as below 9 bound water g g ds 1 51 τy pa therefore yield stress value of the substrate can predict the dewaterability of the digestate after digestion as has been discussed in the previous sections the rheology of the substrate has significant impact on the performance parameters of anaerobic digestion such as degradability biogas production and dewaterability substrate with the lowest viscosity in digester c led to higher vs degradation together with highest biogas production compared to other digesters similar trend has been observed in case of the other rheological parameters such as consistency index yield stress and storage and loss modulus apart from biogas sludge dewaterability is also linked to the rheology of the substrate as has been demonstrated in previous sections digester c with substrate of lower viscosity contained lowest amount of bound water during the digestion period 3 6 the correlation between rheological and physico chemical characteristics of the digester media and biogas production for a comprehensive overview of the relationship between sludge rheological and physico chemical properties and the variations described earlier the overall interaction was statistically studied by pearson s correlations statistical probabilities were achieved by a linear regression at a confidence limit of 95 on each correlation the correlation between the parameters was validated if the p value obtained was lower than 0 05 the results reported in table 5 showed that biogas was negatively and largely correlated with the τy r 0 990 p 0 01 k r 0 987 p 0 01 g r 0 995 p 0 01 and g r 0 961 p 0 01 moreover zeta potential and bw were found to be most strongly correlated with the τy k g and g rheological parameters table 5 also indicated that zeta potential was positively and strongly correlated with the τy r 0 997 p 0 01 k r 0 990 p 0 01 g r 0 995 p 0 01 and g r 0 961 p 0 01 strong correlation between zeta potential and rheology was also observed by bobade et al 2018 similar correlation was discovered between bw and τy r 0 988 p 0 01 k r 0 988 p 0 01 g r 0 997 p 0 01 and g r 0 958 p 0 05 moderate correlations were found between scod rheological parameters because scod initially increases as the result of particulate materials destruction which reduces the network strength and sludge yield stress dissolved materials are then continuously converted to biogas leading to both scod and yield stress reduction for the following days zhang et al 2016 this robust correlation highlights the fact that rheological measurement during digestion can reflect the decomposition of organic matters into biogas 3 7 use of rheological parameters for process monitoring and optimization during digestion flow and viscoelastic behaviour of digested sludge were measured and analysed to periodically report yield stress consistency index as well as storage and loss modulus at strain 1 of digested sludge the evolution of rheological properties over the whole period of digestion is presented in fig 8 in all cases sludge showed a trend toward fluidization during digestion which was similar to the finding reported by zhang et al 2018 the yield stress refers to the minimum applied force at which the fluid starts to flow because of weakened structure and network strength eshtiaghi et al 2013 as fig 8a indicates the yield stress reduction by sludge disruption is most prominent for digester c where yield stress reduced from 3 06 to 2 73 pa 11 drop during the first two days and then further dropped to 2 12 pa another 22 drop toward the end of the digestion period consistency index for digester c also changed from 0 28 to 0 25 pa sn 11 drop and then reached plateau for the remaining days fig 8b moreover g decreased faster than g fig 8c and d which indicated that anaerobic digestion had stronger impact on elasticity and structure of sludge than its viscous property zhang et al 2016 this rapid logarithmic decrease during the initial two days of digestion time for digester c is in accordance with the higher amount of released organic matters compared with other cases fig 3 using statistical analysis the correlation between rheological and physico chemical parameters as the predictors of biogas production on each day of digestion was investigated removing less significant predictor parameters showing p value 0 05 the final equations are as below which show that on each day of digestion there is a strong correlation between consistency index of the digestate and biogas yield the same observation has been seen while correlating loss modulus with biogas yield 10 biogas day2 ml vs added 105 79 105 4 kday2 pa sn 11 biogas day2 ml vs added 348 5 106 6 g day2 pa 12 biogas day7 ml vs added 199 104 k day7 pa sn 13

19097,mesophilic batch anaerobic digesters fed by different substrates were set up to identify the role of substrate rheology in anaerobic digestion performance while operating below the toxic level five substrates of different rheological behaviour but at the same amount of organic matters were prepared by addition of different amount of an inert material 0 0 03 0 07 0 11 and 0 20 g per g of waste activated sludge was to gain a comprehensive insight the interactive relationship between substrate rheology physico chemical properties and biogas production as well as digestate dewaterability was investigated the results proved that better access of microorganisms to organic matters improved the digester performance and led to 19 29 and 12 5 increase in biogas yield and vs removal efficiency respectively moreover the statistical analysis showed that consistency index and loss modulus of sludge could be employed as promising indications for biogas yield while yield stress could predict dewaterability of digestate as far as the other physico chemical properties remained unchanged during digestion measurement of consistency index and loss modulus of digestate could be performed as a reliable tool to monitor biogas production graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion biogas production dewaterability substrate rheology physico chemical properties 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad of sludge has been an increasingly attractive solution for wastewater treatment plants or local authorities willing to meet their environmental commitment enormous attempts have been made to improve the operation of this critical piece of waste management industry however economic sustainability of this technology is still being criticised by the investors who advocate that biogas rate generated by this process may fall under its operational and development cost akta and cecen 2001 girault et al 2012 as both digester homogenisation and gas extraction lean on sludge consistency and structural characteristics rheology of sludge affects the function and efficiency of anaerobic degradation dieudé fauvel et al 2014 therefore investigation of the role of sludge rheology in ad performance can help improving biogas production waste activated sludge is mostly in the form of extracellular polymeric substances a high molecular weight mixture of polymers this structure keeps microbial aggregates together in a three dimensional matrix affecting biodegradability hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and fluidity of was sheng et al 2010 liu et al 2016 as sludge solid concentrations increase this polymeric structure become stronger and affect sludge viscosity and its fluidity and lead to several consequences such as short circuiting substrate in the reactor or formation of stagnant regions which reduces effective reactor volume and substrate contact with the active micro organisms all of these can result in decreased mass transfer and heat transfer rate preventing the influent sludge temperature to reach the operating temperature of the biogas fermenter and consequently impacting bioreaction rate o neil 1985 in summary rheological behaviour of sludge has a key role to play in heat and mass transfer during conversion of biomass to methane through anaerobic digestion as rheological behaviour is affected by physico chemical properties the interactive relationship between rheological and physico chemical properties should be investigated zhang et al 2016 argued that there was a strong linear relationship between the storage modulus g and total organic concentration forster 1983 2002 discovered that yield stress had a logarithmic relationship with both bound water bw and surface charge similarly surface charge and hydrophobicity had a part to play in flocculation settling and dewatering shin et al 2000 a linear relationship between elastic modulus and compactness of sludge dewaterability during ad was found by zhang et al 2018 and poor dewaterability of highly viscous sludge li and yang 2007 however there is a lack of comprehensive research on the inherent interaction between degradability physico chemistry and rheology to further determine whether rheological parameters are able to describe the performance of anaerobic digesters including both biogas yield and dewaterability while the rheological properties of sludge during digestion have been broadly studied no consensus has yet been reached in respect to the specific role of the rheology of substrate on degradability and biogas production in addition to date no link has been found between dewaterability of digestate and rheological behaviour of substrate the aim of this work is to develop a correlation to link biogas yield and dewaterability of digestate to substrate rheology this work also investigates the inherent interaction between degradability physico chemistry and rheology to further determine whether rheological parameters are able to reflect the performance of anaerobic digesters 2 material and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge and inoculum digested sludge ds as inoculum and waste activated sludge was as an original substrate were both collected in early march autumn season from eastern treatment plant victoria australia ds and was containers were transferred to the lab on the same day of collection and stored at 37 c and 4 c respectively upon arrival both sludge characteristics then were tested as they were fresh and reported in table 1 2 2 addition of an inert component to was to prepare substrate of different rheological properties almost all the materials have potential biogas production to some extent making it difficult to disentangle the role of rheology and chemistry of sludge by adding co substrate in this work the addition of an inert material to was could assist preparing rheologically different substrates of the same chemistry and organic matters content to achieve this poly methyl methacrylate pmma powder supplied by sigma aldrich also known as acrylic was used the chemical structure and properties of pmma were studied and presented in table 2 to make sure that pmma has no interference to the chemical tests scod concentration of different blends of pmma and demineralized water was tested the scod results for blends of pmma and demineralized water were the same as the blank sample showing that there was no oxidation reaction between this component and the oxidant reagent as well as no organic matters were added to samples by addition of this powder these results verified that polymeric powder cannot be digestible by microorganism during digestion the absence of nitrogen group in the chemical structure of this polymer also will undoubtedly cause no fingerprint on the ammonia concentration results due to the reduction of tensile strength of this polymer by increased water absorption ishiyama et al 2005 in all organic testing centrifugation was avoided and instead all samples were filtered by 0 45 μm filter syringe to get liquor for the chemical tests the substantially larger particle size of this polymeric powder 48 μm compared to the porosity of the syringe filter 0 45 μm guaranteed that powder does not pass through 2 3 preparation of the feeding substrates of different digesters substrate was was mixed with different dose of an inorganic matter pmma to produce substrates of the same organic content but different flow behaviour different amounts of pmma powder 0 03 0 07 0 11 and 0 20 g g was were added to prepare substrates of different rheological properties for digesters b c d e while digester a which had no pmma was used as control pmma was blends were stirred at 300 rpm for 20 min to assure a well homogenised mixture flow curves and detailed herschel bulkley model parameters of the different substrates are shown in fig 1 a and fig 1b respectively the storage modulus g and loss modulus g as a function of applied strain are plotted in fig 1c the influence of pmma powder on sludge rheological parameters can be explained by modified particle interaction you et al 2018 considering that the isoelectric point of bacteria is at ph 2 4 at ph above isoelectric sludge ph is 6 5 in this work charges on surfaces of the sludge particle will be negative addition of pmma reduced the zeta potential of mixture as pmma particles carry positive zeta potential at this ph falahati et al 2014 this phenomenon decreased repulsion between flocs and caused shrinkage of flocs matrix leading to a better flow due to reduction of the exposed cross sectional area sanin 2002 for this reason the viscosity yield stress consistency index and viscoelastic parameters of substrate of the digester b and c pmma up to 0 07 g g was are lower compared to was without powder however addition of pmma above 0 07 g g was increased rheological properties of substrate of the digesters d and e due to increase in solids particles which was more effective on rheological behaviour compared to the impact of surface charge no effect of digestion was expected on the results because the measurement was undertaken immediately after mixing of was and pmma to sum up flow consistency of substrate in digester c had a lower value compared to the other cases which resulted a better fluidity of this substrate repeating all these tests for the mixture of each substrate with inoculum led to observation similar to fig 1 summarized in table 3 table 3 shows the details of the prepared substrates assuming that amount of organic matters in the control were equal to those in the other digesters this speculation was reasonable as all digesters were fed by the same amount of organic matters moreover scod for all digesters including pmma powder was close to that of the control digester which well confirmed that pmma was an inorganic matter implying the same organic matters in all cases 2 4 experimental design and set up to assess the impact of different substrate rheology on anaerobic digester performance five different groups of digesters were fed with five different substrates having different rheology but the same amount of organic matters content in all cases 55 ml of substrate was added to 75 ml of inoculum in 250 ml serum bottles based on the substrate inoculum ratio of 1 1 vs basis ho et al 2013 all bottles were flushed with nitrogen gas for 1 min chen et al 2018 and sealed immediately with rubber suba seal 16 mm sigma aldrich before incubating in a shaker at 100 rpm 37 1 c for 30 days ten serum bottles were used for each batch a e to periodically assess the changes in properties and biogas yield during anaerobic digestion two bottles containing the inoculum and no substrate were used to correct background methane potential of the added inoculum 2 5 degradability and digester performance periodically two bottles of each batch were collected from the incubator to analyse the sludge behaviour on different days of digestion the sludge samples were collected in sealed tubes which were quickly cooled by dipping in an ice bath to assess degradability and digester performance biogas volume total solids ts volatile solids vs total chemical oxygen demand tcod and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were measured water displacement method was used to measure daily gas production in this method the increase of water level pushed by the gas is equivalent to the biogas volume in ml ts and vs were measured using method 1684 provided by the u s environmental protection agency epa 2010 sludge sample was dried in the oven at 105 c for 24h until reaching constant weight to avoid absorbing water the residue was immediately kept in the desiccator to reach room temperature the ratio of dried solid over wet sample weight was calculated as ts burning the residue at 550 c for 2h hosnani et al 2010 vs was calculated after deducting the weight of ash from initial dried solids weight and then dividing by dried solids weight to analyse scod particulate materials were removed by filtration through syringe filter 0 45 μm for tcod suspension samples were diluted 41 times with deionized water before oxidation by reagent in such a way that the dilution factor was constant for every sample chemical oxygen demand measurement was performed using hach procedure cod high range plus reagents dr5000 spectrophotometer and drb200 digester all the experimental tests were duplicated and conducted on the day of sampling to eliminate the storage effect 2 6 inhibitory by products to assess inhibition factors in the digesters ph level and ammonia concentration were periodically monitored ph was measured using a calibrated ph meter thermoorion model 550a and ammonia concentration was tested by colorimetric techniques using a hach spectrophotometer model dr 4000 u according to the method 10031 for the analysis of ammonia particulate materials were removed by centrifugation at 10000 rpm 13000 g for 5 min followed by syringe filter 0 45 μm the filtrate was then diluted 41 times with deionized water before adding to the reagent 2 7 physico chemical properties surface characteristics was analysed by zeta potential using zetasizer from malvern instrument due to the problem of sludge settlement in the measurement cell tixier et al 2003 all samples were centrifuged at 10000 rpm 13000 g for 5 min before adding to disposable folded capillary cells dts1070 all measurements were relied on the interaction of the particles in the filtrate bound water was measured using differential scanning calorimeter dsc ta instrument grounded on the assumption that up to 20 c all the free water freezes whilst the bound water does not colin and gazbar 1995 in each test 20 mg sludge was cooled from 20 c to 20 c at a cooling rate of 5 c min peeters et al 2013 and then increased to 20 c at the same rate while the released heat during freezing of water was recorded the bound water content for each test was then determined by eq 1 1 w b w t δ h δ h o where wt g g dry sludge is the quotient of total water and dry sludge 105 c overnight δh j g is the exothermic area and δho 334 7 j g is the standard fusion heat of water perry and green 1984 2 8 settleability and dewaterability settling characteristics was analysed by measuring gravity settled volume in ml occupied by 1 g of a sludge suspension after 30 min in graduated cylinders sludge volume index svi was then calculated by eq 2 zhuang et al 2017 2 s v i 100 h 30 h 0 x 0 where h30 cm is the height of sludge sample after 30 min h0 cm is the initial height of sludge and x0 is the solids concentration of sludge the centrifugal dewatering hidaka et al 2013 was used to evaluate the dewaterability of sludge because this method is known to be a reliable alternative to the filterability measurement constant pressure filtration to analyse compressibility and permeability loginov et al 2016 40 ml of digested sludge samples were centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min hidaka et al 2013 sludge cake was then weighed before drying at 105 c overnight water content of dewatered sludge cake was calculated from the difference of dried sludge and initial cake weight as below zhuang et al 2017 3 w c 1 m d r i e d s l u d g e m s l u d g e c a k e 100 where mdried sludge g is the weight of the dried sludge and msludge cake g is the weight of the sludge cake after centrifugation 2 9 rheological measurement rheological measurements were performed using stress controlled rheometer dhr3 ta instruments connected to a temperature controlled water bath to eliminate the interference of particles inside sludge suspension in rheology results wide gap geometry was preferred for rheological measurement with cup and grooved bob bob diameter 15 mm cup diameter 30 mm bob length 44 mm in each test 30 ml of sludge sample was taken into the rheometer cup all rheological tests were carried out with the following procedure to erase material memory and have reproducible measurements sample were pre sheared for 150 s at 300 1 s baudez et al 2013 followed by 5 min equilibrium at zero shear rate following equilibrium time viscoelastic properties of sludge were measured first viscoelastic materials such as sludge showed a combination of solid like and liquid like behaviour which were defined as storage and loss moduli g g respectively deborah and de 2008 to investigate the viscoelastic characteristics amplitude sweep oscillation tests were conducted through which an increasing ramp of strain from 1 to 300 at constant frequency of 1 hz was applied with collecting 30 points per decade to determine the flow behaviour stress sweep test was performed through which a decreasing ramp of shear rate from 300 to 1s 1 was applied with collecting 10 points per decade in all the rheological tests temperature was kept at 25 c for conical cylinder cup and bob geometry the shear stress pa exerted on the bob can be related to the torque as eq 4 estellé et al 2008 4 τ b m m 2 π h r b 2 where m is the torque n m h the length of bob m and rb is the radius of bob m for a gap in which rc rb rb the shear rate 1 s at the bob surface is then calculated using krieger s method estellé et al 2008 5 γ b 2 ω n α 2 n α 2 n 1 where ω is the angular velocity rad s α is the ratio of cup radius to bob radius and n is the derivative of ln τb with respect to ln ω herschel bulkley model eq 6 has been known as an accurate model for developing flow behaviour profile of sludge eshtiaghi et al 2012 6 τ τ y k γ n where τy is the yield stress pa k is the consistency index pa sn and n is the flow behaviour index to develop the flow curves shear stress and shear rate of all samples were recalculated and then fitted to the herschel bulkley model using eqs 4 6 respectively 2 10 statistical analysis statistical analysis for the anaerobic digesters performance was performed with minitab 18 and ibm spss software minitab was used to generate a response surface methodology rsm model between the studied parameters this statistical tool formulated a mathematical equation to describe the correlation of the rheological parameters with biogas production during digestion ibm spss software was used to determine the linear correlation between two variables using pearson s correlation coefficient the correlations were considered statistically significant at 95 confidence interval p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of rheology on degradability and biogas production this part compares the performance of digesters a e to investigate how substrate consistency can affect degradability of the substrate during anaerobic digestion to analyse the performance of the digesters organic matter removal during the digestion period was calculated basically during the first 21 days of sludge digestion most of the readily degradable organic matters are consumed reaching the plateau for the next days the trend is because the remaining proteins and carbohydrates are recalcitrant and could not be well consumed by microorganisms yang et al 2015 fig 2 compares the degradability and biogas yield of the different digesters over 30 day anaerobic digestion as the deviations of biogas production and degradability of replicate digesters were less than 7 mean values are reported in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 sludge of the lowest viscosity in digester c led to higher amount of biogas which was in coincidence with highest degree of vs degradation compared to the other digesters on the second day of digestion volatile solids removal in digester c was approximately double that of digester b and four and five times higher than d and e biogas production during the following 17 days in digester a b and c sharply soared to about 189 2 208 5 230 4 ml gvsadded respectively and then enhanced slowly towards the end of the process to reach a steady state in contrast a slower biogas yield growth was seen in the first three weeks for digesters d and e which then reached steady state to about 169 5 and 155 8 ml gvsadded at day 30 to sum up digester c was superior to the other cases over the whole period of the process ranked for 19 29 more biogas compared to the control digester while there was only 9 52 biogas yield rise in digester b in contrast 14 18 and 21 14 biogas yield drop were observed in digester d and e compared to the control digester respectively 3 2 impact of rheology on solubilisation anaerobic digestion performance can also be reflected by cod reduction total cod contains the amount of main organic matters such as carbohydrates proteins and lipids while soluble cod holds dissolved part of tcod meaning easily degradable portion fig 3 compares the released scod of was in each digester after two days digestion as can be seen higher amount of scod was released in the digester c fed by substrate of the lowest viscosity compared to other cases fig 4 shows the reduction of soluble cod as a function of digestion time similarly the dissolved organic matters were faster consumed in digester c but digesters b d and e could not decompose as much particulate organic matters compared to digester c this observation is well supported by the volatile solids reduction results in fig 2 where digester b d and e showed lower degradability compared to digester c 3 3 no inhibitory by products production during digestion during the digestion process ph for all digesters fig 5 a across all digestion days remained between the range of 6 8 7 8 favourable for the survival of microorganism yang et al 2015 also decomposition of protein produces ammonia that can act as an inhibitory compound ammonia concentration fig 5b for all cases was below 1200 mg l the toxic level reported by jan moestedt et al 2016a so the poor performance of the digesters in terms of organic matter degradation and biogas production is not due to process inhibition 3 4 the link between substrate rheological parameters and biogas production plotting cumulative biogas yield after 30 day digestion as a function of consistency yield stress g and g in fig 6 shows that biogas production increases as these rheological parameters decrease a possible explanation can be the improved fluid transfer and easier access to the food for microorganisms provided by better flowability j moestedt et al 2016b thus mass transfer between organic matters and microorganisms promoted resulting in increased biogas yield the poor degradability and biogas production as a result of poor fluidity might be as a result of formation of stagnant regions and accumulation of sludge due to poor response to being sheared properly on the first days of digestion this observation is well supported by the volatile solids reduction results in fig 2 where digester d and e showed less degradability compared to the other cases plotting cumulative biogas yield after 30 day digestion as a function of rheological parameters of substrate of different digesters in fig 6 the trend pinpoints that the more the fluid like behaviour in the substrate the higher the production of biogas this result revealed that the substrate rheology has a key role to play in biogas yield minitab 18 was used for analysis of variance anova with general linear regression analyses of the data with 95 confidence applying the anova technique the less significant terms with probability value p value 0 05 table 4 were removed from the equations with not much change in the precision of the correlation the final equations of biogas production as a function of rheological behaviour are as follow 7 biogas ml vs added 274 03 162 73 k pa sn 8 biogas ml vs added 637 50 161 76 g pa therefore consistency index and loss modulus of sludge are the most significant rheological parameters effective on biogas production 3 5 impact of rheology on dewaterability in this part settleability and compressibility of digestates are compared to see how better fluidity can effect dewaterability of the final product of anaerobic digestion in anaerobic digestion the eps content in the sludge is one of the main characteristics that may affect the dewaterability of the sludge high eps content may increase the viscosity of the sludge that would result in difficulty in dewaterability li and yang 2007 as there are many charged functional groups in eps they have been shown to have physico chemical interactions such as electrostatic hydrophobic van der waals and hydrogen bonding geyik et al 2016 as well as adsorption biosorption wang et al 2014 among these surface charge and hydrophobicity have received a lot of attention regarding their dramatic impacts on important properties of sludge such as flocculation settling dewatering shin et al 2000 because of digestion eps transfers from particles into the bulk fluid making the flow easier and increases the functional group and surface charge of the bulk fluid fig 7 shows potential difference between the dispersion medium and the stationary layer of fluid attached to the dispersed particle by zeta potential as can be seen negative value of zeta potential in digester c is higher than other cases which is due to higher degradation higher negative charge led to less settled volume which was in a good agreement with deterioration of flocculation at more negative values of zeta potential li et al 2016 sludge volume index svi of digestate on day 30 was also calculated to realize how much volume per gram dried solids settled after a certain time as shown in fig 7 comparable settleability of the digestates from different digesters was consistent with the zeta potential values except for digesters d and e as the correlation between zeta potential and svi has been found unreliable by zhang et al 2015 settleability is not going to be the only factor affecting the sludge dewatering yin et al 2004 so bound water bw and water content in final cake after centrifuging dewatering were also measured as it can be seen digester c with substrate of lower viscosity demonstrated less amount of bound water on the last day of digestion it is perhaps because of the greater release of water from intracellular materials during flocs destruction dai et al 2014 bw in sludge structure acts as a resistance to compression forster 2002 the smaller the bw content the more solids could be compressed resulting in squeezing more free moisture out kopp and dichtl 2001 lower water content wc of digester c fig 7 confirmed the low amount of water trapped in sludge structure on the last day of digestion because bw could not be discharged by mechanical devices such as centrifuge the correlation between bound water and rheological behaviour was analysed the same approach as section 3 4 and the final equation is as below 9 bound water g g ds 1 51 τy pa therefore yield stress value of the substrate can predict the dewaterability of the digestate after digestion as has been discussed in the previous sections the rheology of the substrate has significant impact on the performance parameters of anaerobic digestion such as degradability biogas production and dewaterability substrate with the lowest viscosity in digester c led to higher vs degradation together with highest biogas production compared to other digesters similar trend has been observed in case of the other rheological parameters such as consistency index yield stress and storage and loss modulus apart from biogas sludge dewaterability is also linked to the rheology of the substrate as has been demonstrated in previous sections digester c with substrate of lower viscosity contained lowest amount of bound water during the digestion period 3 6 the correlation between rheological and physico chemical characteristics of the digester media and biogas production for a comprehensive overview of the relationship between sludge rheological and physico chemical properties and the variations described earlier the overall interaction was statistically studied by pearson s correlations statistical probabilities were achieved by a linear regression at a confidence limit of 95 on each correlation the correlation between the parameters was validated if the p value obtained was lower than 0 05 the results reported in table 5 showed that biogas was negatively and largely correlated with the τy r 0 990 p 0 01 k r 0 987 p 0 01 g r 0 995 p 0 01 and g r 0 961 p 0 01 moreover zeta potential and bw were found to be most strongly correlated with the τy k g and g rheological parameters table 5 also indicated that zeta potential was positively and strongly correlated with the τy r 0 997 p 0 01 k r 0 990 p 0 01 g r 0 995 p 0 01 and g r 0 961 p 0 01 strong correlation between zeta potential and rheology was also observed by bobade et al 2018 similar correlation was discovered between bw and τy r 0 988 p 0 01 k r 0 988 p 0 01 g r 0 997 p 0 01 and g r 0 958 p 0 05 moderate correlations were found between scod rheological parameters because scod initially increases as the result of particulate materials destruction which reduces the network strength and sludge yield stress dissolved materials are then continuously converted to biogas leading to both scod and yield stress reduction for the following days zhang et al 2016 this robust correlation highlights the fact that rheological measurement during digestion can reflect the decomposition of organic matters into biogas 3 7 use of rheological parameters for process monitoring and optimization during digestion flow and viscoelastic behaviour of digested sludge were measured and analysed to periodically report yield stress consistency index as well as storage and loss modulus at strain 1 of digested sludge the evolution of rheological properties over the whole period of digestion is presented in fig 8 in all cases sludge showed a trend toward fluidization during digestion which was similar to the finding reported by zhang et al 2018 the yield stress refers to the minimum applied force at which the fluid starts to flow because of weakened structure and network strength eshtiaghi et al 2013 as fig 8a indicates the yield stress reduction by sludge disruption is most prominent for digester c where yield stress reduced from 3 06 to 2 73 pa 11 drop during the first two days and then further dropped to 2 12 pa another 22 drop toward the end of the digestion period consistency index for digester c also changed from 0 28 to 0 25 pa sn 11 drop and then reached plateau for the remaining days fig 8b moreover g decreased faster than g fig 8c and d which indicated that anaerobic digestion had stronger impact on elasticity and structure of sludge than its viscous property zhang et al 2016 this rapid logarithmic decrease during the initial two days of digestion time for digester c is in accordance with the higher amount of released organic matters compared with other cases fig 3 using statistical analysis the correlation between rheological and physico chemical parameters as the predictors of biogas production on each day of digestion was investigated removing less significant predictor parameters showing p value 0 05 the final equations are as below which show that on each day of digestion there is a strong correlation between consistency index of the digestate and biogas yield the same observation has been seen while correlating loss modulus with biogas yield 10 biogas day2 ml vs added 105 79 105 4 kday2 pa sn 11 biogas day2 ml vs added 348 5 106 6 g day2 pa 12 biogas day7 ml vs added 199 104 k day7 pa sn 13 biogas day7 ml vs added 25 2 84 1 g day7 pa 14 biogas day17 ml vs added 257 13 160 1 k day17 pa sn 15 biogas day17 ml vs added 555 6 163 16 g day17 pa therefore it is evident that shear stress measurement or viscoelastic measurement can be an effective indicator of the anaerobic digestion process performance and can be successfully implemented for process monitoring and optimisation 4 conclusion in this work anaerobic digestion of substrates with different rheology but at the same organic matters content was compared the main conclusions are as below 1 rheological behaviour of the sludge significantly affects the degree of breakage and decomposition of the flocs and may improve or deteriorate the level of released organic matters 2 higher fluidity of the sludge potential to provide better contact between microorganisms and food would be a pivotal contributor to improve biogas production and dewaterability of digestate as it would tend to help further release of macromolecular components and bound water during anaerobic digestion 3 consistency index and loss modulus of sludge before entering to digester could be employed as promising indication of biogas production in this work 33 and 5 reduction in consistency index and loss modulus respectively resulted in approximately 19 29 increase in biogas yield 4 yield stress of sludge before entering to digester could predict dewaterability of digestate it was observed that 12 reduction in yield stress contributed to about 12 dewaterability improvement 5 measurement of consistency index and loss modulus of digestate during digestion could be employed as a beneficial tool to monitor biogas production conflicts of interest the authors declare that they have no competing interests declaration of

effects of ph and dissolved oxygen do on the degradation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and on the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps in the solar chlorine system the degradation of 24 structurally diverse ppcps was enhanced appreciably in the solar chlorine system compared to solar irradiation and dark chlorination the reactive species in the solar chlorine system were identified to be hydroxyl radicals ho reactive chlorine species rcs i e cl and clo and ozone with increasing ph from 6 to 8 the steady state concentrations of ho and cl decreased from 1 23 10 14

in 90 min accordingly the removal efficiencies of 6 ppcps decreased and 11 ppcps increased the decreased removal of ppcps with increasing ph was due to the decrease in ho and cl while the increased removal was attributed to the increased clo and ozone the presence of do enhanced the degradation of most ppcps indicating the role of ozone on the degradation the formation of total organic chlorine tocl and known dbps was enhanced by 60 7 and 159 4 respectively in the solar chlorine system compared to chlorination in a simulated drinking water containing 2 5 mg l 1 natural organic matter nom as the ph rose from 6 to 8 tocl formation decreased by 16 2 while that of known dbps increased by 58 6 in solar chlorine the absence of do slightly suppressed the formation of tocl and known dbps this study illustrated the significant role of rcs in the solar chlorine system which enhanced the degradation of micropollutants but increased the formation of chlorinated dbps graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps solar chlorine disinfection byproducts dbps hydroxyl radicals ho reactive chlorine species 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are widely used in contemporary society daughton and ternes 1999 most ppcps are often released to aquatic environments and thus have been frequently detected in surface water groundwater and drinking water in the range of ng l 1 to μg l 1 sacher et al 2001 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 yang et al 2011 some ppcps are resistant to traditional water and wastewater treatment such as coagulation sedimentation filtration and biological treatment westerhoff et al 2005 some with low hydrophobicity are hardly adsorbed to activated carbon vieno et al 2007 and some without electron rich groups are hardly removed by chlorine chlorine dioxide or ozone lee and von gunten 2010 thus alternative treatment technologies for the removal of ppcps are needed uv based advanced oxidation processes aops such as uv h2o2 uv o3 uv chlorine and uv persulfate have been reported as efficient methods for ppcp removal via generation of free radicals such as hydroxyl radicals ho reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl clo and cl2 and sulfate radicals so4 esplugas et al 2002 rosenfeldt and linden 2007 wu et al 2016 xiang et al 2016 lian et al 2017 however uv based aops require uv lamps for irradiation which are accompanied by high operating costs and considerably high energy requirements for example the uv energy requirement accounts for 94 of total costs of the uv h2o2 process for 90 removal of 28 kinds of ppcps while that accounts for 10 6 90 of the uv chlorine process guo et al 2018 compared to uv light solar light is renewable and available worldwide at a much lower cost solar irradiation has been used for disinfection lonnen et al 2005 and the degradation of contaminants such as ppcps algal toxins hydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and disinfection byproducts dbps chen et al 2010 song et al 2012 ge et al 2016 yan et al 2017 recently the solar photolysis of free chlorine system solar chlorine has drawn increasing attention in water treatment for disinfection and ppcp degradation the solar chlorine system was reported to be effective at inactivating bacillus subtilis spores and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts forsyth et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 also the system showed great potential to degrade contaminants such as carbamazepine diethyltoluamide caffeine and naphthenic acids shu et al 2014 sun et al 2016 yang et al 2016 considering its reduced energy requirements and considerable treatment efficiencies the solar chlorine system may be a promising alternative to the uv chlorine system however the efficiency and mechanism of the solar chlorine system in the degradation of structurally diverse ppcps are largely unknown the major reactive species for disinfection or contaminant removal in the solar chlorine system were found to be hydroxyl radical ho and ozone o3 forsyth et al 2013 yang et al 2016 following eqs 1 3 1 hocl ocl hv ho o cl 2 ocl hv o 3p cl 3 o 3p o2 o3 however the contribution of reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl clo and cl2 to pathogen inactivation and ppcp degradation has often been neglected forsyth et al 2013 yang et al 2016 rcs have been demonstrated to play an important role in the uv chlorine process for the degradation of micropollutants such as benzoic acid trimethoprim caffeine and carbamazepine fang et al 2014 wu et al 2016 guo et al 2017 cl was directly formed via chlorine photolysis eq 1 while secondary radicals clo and cl2 were generated via eqs 4 8 wu et al 2016 currently the role of rcs has not yet been recognized in the solar chlorine system and needs further investigation 4 cl cl cl2 k for 6 5 109 m 1 s 1 k res 1 1 105 s 1 5 hocl ho clo h2o k 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 6 hocl cl clo cl h k 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 7 ocl ho clo oh k 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 8 ocl cl clo cl k 8 2 109 m 1 s 1 as discussed above the solar chlorine system contains multiple reactive species such as ho ozone and rcs the formation of these reactive species is significantly affected by ph and dissolved oxygen do ph affects the formation and consumption of reactive species by influencing the abundance of hocl and ocl pka 7 5 the molar absorption coefficient of ocl overlaps with uv region uvb and uva from 290 to 400 nm of the solar spectrum fig s1 which suggests that sunlight may be very efficient at photolyzing ocl shu et al 2014 meanwhile the scavenging of ho and cl by ocl is much higher than that by hocl eqs 5 8 wu et al 2016 the decay kinetics of ozone are also highly affected by ph von gunten 2003 do is a significant precursor in the reaction with ground state atomic oxygen o 3p to generate ozone buxton and subhani 1972 ulrik et al 1984 in addition o 3p is only generated via the photolysis of ocl and not of hocl forsyth et al 2013 thus the effects of ph and do on the oxidation chemistry and the degradation of structurally diverse ppcps need further investigation the formation of chlorinated dbps in the solar chlorine system may be different from chlorination alone due to the generation of reactive species natural organic matter nom is the most important dbp precursor during chlorination of surface water and drinking water bond et al 2009 kanan and karanfil 2011 reactive species such as ho rcs and ozone could alter the properties of nom and further affect dbp formation rcs formed in the solar chlorine system may directly react with nom to generate more chlorinated dbps like those observed in the uv chlorine system wang et al 2015 2017 the formation of chlorinated dbps from nom in the solar chlorine system and the effects of ph and do are totally unknown and need investigation the objectives of this work were 1 to evaluate the removal efficiency of many structurally diverse ppcps at practical concentrations by the solar chlorine system and to identify the reactive species such as ho rcs and ozone responsible for the degradation 2 to investigate the effects of ph and do on ppcp degradation and 3 to assess the effects of ph and do on the formation of total organic chlorine tocl and dbps twenty four typical ppcps were selected as target compounds due to their frequent occurrence in aqueous environments and included antibiotics non

xenon lamp was employed to generate simulated sunlight experiments were conducted in a quartz reactor with rapid mixing provided which was air tight by using a quartz plug fig s2 the fluence rates at the surface of the reactor were recorded to be 18 w m 2 at 290 400 nm and 545 w m 2 at 290 800 nm by an illuminometer ocean optics usb 4000 the spectrum of the simulated sunlight is shown in fig s1 the temperature was maintained at 25 0 2 c a 250 ml testing solution containing 2 μg l 1 of each ppcp and buffered at a certain ph by 2 mm phosphate buffer was dosed with the naocl stock solution and simultaneously exposed to solar irradiation the chlorine dosage in the solution was 1 mg l 1 samples were collected after 20 min and quenched by ascorbic acid at a molar ratio of ascorbic acid to chlorine of 1 5 1 and were subsequently spiked with the isotope internal standards the samples were then subjected to solid phase extraction spe using hlb cartridges 200 mg 6 ml waters to investigate the effects of do the experiment was conducted in a similar manner under oxygen free conditions by purging with nitrogen gas for 30 min before the reaction to ensure the concentration of do less than 0 1 mg l 1 control tests of ppcp degradation by direct solar photolysis and dark chlorination were carried out in a similar manner but in the absence of chlorine and solar irradiation respectively additional tests were conducted under similar conditions to determine the concentrations of radicals ho cl and clo and the ozone exposure in the system by using probe compounds the former was conducted under oxygen free conditions by using 1 μm nb ba and dmob the latter was conducted by using 5 μm cinnamic acid another experiment was conducted by using a light filter fsq gg400 newport to filtrate light with wavelengths 400 nm to examine the contribution of light at 400 800 nm to the degradation of probe compounds and the production of reactive species in the solar chlorine system the dbps formed during chlorination and solar chlorine treatment were quantified in a simulated drinking water containing 2 5 mg l 1 nom at a chlorine dose of 100 μm after a given reaction time samples were collected and divided into four portions the first portion was analysed by dpd fas titration for the determination of chlorine residuals the second and third portions were quenched with ascorbic acid for the analyses of haas and volatile dbps respectively the fourth portion was quenched with sodium sulfite for the analyses of tocl and acute toxicity all tests were performed at least twice the error bars in all data plots represent the maximum and minimum of the experimental data of the duplicated test results 2 3 analytical methods ppcps were quantified by ultra high performance liquid chromatography mass mass spectrometry uhplc ms ms thermo tsq quantum access max a waters acquity uplc hss t3 column 2 1 mm 100 mm 1 8 μm was used to separate the ppcps details of the uhplc and mass

and a c 18 column proshell 4 6 mm 50 mm 2 7 μm with detection wavelengths were set at 266 nm 227 nm 227 nm and 230 nm respectively eluents of methanol and water with different ratios were used for the quantification of ba nb dmob and benzaldehyde at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the concentration of free chlorine was determined by the dpd fas titration method apha awwa wef 2012 the ph was measured by a ph meter fe20 mettler toledo and do was measured by a do meter jpsj 605f rex tocl was determined by an aox analyser xplorer te instruments analyses of volatile dbps including trichloromethane tcm chloral hydrate ch 1 1 dichloropropanone 1 1 dcp 1 1 1 trichloropropanone 1 1 1 tcp dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloronitromethane tcnm and haloacetic acids haas including dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa were carried out with a gas chromatograph agilent 7890b coupled with an electron capture detector ecd based on usepa method 551 1 and usepa method 552 3 usepa 1998 respectively an hp 5 fused silica capillary column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 μm agilent j w and a db 1701 fused silica capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent j w were used for the analyses of volatile dbps and haas respectively acute toxicity tests were conducted by using a lumistox toxicity analyser hach usa and vibrio fischeri strains the results after 30 min contact time were reported as luminescence inhibition 2 4 determination of reactive species to determine the concentrations of ho cl and clo probe compounds of nb ba and dmob were spiked in the solar chlorine system under oxygen free conditions nb only reacts with ho but not rcs while ba is only reactive with ho and cl fang et al 2014 and dmob reacts with ho cl clo and ozone alfassi et al 1988 mvula et al 2009 nist 2017 therefore the experiments were carried out in the absence of oxygen to exclude ozone in the system then ho ss cl ss and clo ss were calculated by eqs 9 11 9 k nb k ho nb ho ss 10 k ba k ho ba ho ss k cl ba cl ss 11 k dmob k ho dmob ho ss k cl dmob cl ss k clo dmob clo ss where k nb k ba and k dmob represent the pseudo first order rate constants k for the degradation of nb ba and dmob by solar chlorine respectively ho ss cl ss and clo ss represent the steady state concentrations of ho cl and clo respectively k ho nb k ho ba and k cl ba represent the second order rate constants for nb with ho ba with ho and ba with cl respectively which were reported to be 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 and 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 k ho dmob k cl dmob and k clo dmob represent the second order rate constants of dmob reacting with ho cl and clo respectively which were reported to be 7 0 109 m 1 s 1 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 and 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 alfassi et al 1988 nist 2017 note that the degradation of nb ba and dmob by either direct solar photolysis or dark chlorination was negligible fig s3 cinnamic acid was selected as a probe compound to calculate the exposure of ozone which rapidly reacted with ozone k 3 8 105 m 1 s 1 to generate benzaldehyde in a 1 1 stoichiometry leitzke et al 2001 the exposure of ozone was calculated by the production of benzaldehyde 3 results and discussion 3 1 ppcp degradation in the solar chlorine system under neutral condition fig 1 compares the removal efficiencies of ppcps by solar photolysis chlorination and solar chlorine at ph 7 0 and 1 mg l 1 chlorine in pure water in 20 min the removal efficiencies of most ppcps were negligible by direct solar photolysis chlorination was selective and was only efficient for the removal of 5 ppcps acetaminophen azithromycin trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and triclosan which had the removal efficiencies of higher than 50 compared to direct solar photolysis and chlorination the solar chlorine system was much more efficient for the removal of all ppcps which were divided into 3 groups 1 12 compounds with removal efficiencies lower than 50 by solar chlorine were defined as group i and included metronidazole dimetridazole ornidazole nalidixic acid atrazine ibuprofen primidone flumequine cyclophosphamide metoprolol chloramphenicol and bezafibrate 2 7 compounds with removal efficiencies higher than 50 by solar chlorine but not by chlorination were defined as group ii and included venlafaxine caffeine carbamazepine gemfibrozil diclofenac naproxen and propranolol 3 5 compounds with high removal efficiencies in both solar chlorine and chlorination 50 were designated group iii and included acetaminophen azithromycin trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and triclosan ppcps in group i lack electron donating functional groups while ppcps in group ii and group iii contain electron donating functional groups 3 2 identification of ho rcs and ozone in the solar chlorine system to identify different radicals of ho and rcs i e cl and clo in the solar chlorine system the probes nb ba and dmob were used together under oxygen free conditions at ph 7 k nb k ba and k dmob were determined to be 0 00176 min 1 0 00336 min 1 and 0 02558 min 1 respectively by solar chlorine fig s4 then ho ss cl ss and clo ss were calculated to be 7 52 10 15 m 6 46 10 16 m and 1 72 10 13 m respectively fig 2 a the concentration of cl was about one order of magnitude lower than that of ho while the concentration of clo was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of ho and cl the high concentration of clo resulted in its high contribution to the degradation of ppcps containing electron donating functional groups such as caffeine carbamazepine and gemfibrozil with second order rate constants higher than 108 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2018 the degradation of nb ba and dmob was insignificant after filtering the light under 400 nm fig s5 indicating that the light ranging from 400 to 800 nm had little contribution to the production of reactive species the uv fluence rate at 290 400 nm of the real solar light was higher than that of the simulated solar light the former was 43 2 w m 2 while the latter was 18 w m 2 fig s1 the degradation rates of the probes nb ba and dmob by solar chlorine using real solar light were obviously higher than that using simulated solar light under oxygen free conditions figs s4 and s6 accordingly ho ss cl ss and clo ss were determined to be 1 42 10 13 m 1 30 10 14 m and 1 11 10 12 m respectively in the real solar chlorine system fig 2a which were 18 9 20 1 and 6 5 times of those in simulated solar chlorine system respectively this result indicates that real solar light is more effective for the production of reactive species than the simulated solar light in the solar chlorine system note that ho ss cl ss and clo ss in the uv chlorine system are in the range of 10 13 m 10 14 m and 10 10 m at the similar chlorine dosage respectively under the uv fluence rate at 254 nm of 7 8 w m 2 guo et al 2017 which are 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than those in the solar chlorine system at the fluence rate of light at 290 400 nm of 18 w m 2 from the simulated solar light the higher production of radicals by uv chlorine is higher than that by solar chlorine regardless of the operation costs however the formation of ozone in solar chlorine can benefit the degradation of some ppcps ozone is reported to be a reactive species in the solar chlorine system in the presence of do yang et al 2016 cinnamic acid was used as a probe to investigate the production of ozone in the solar chlorine system ozone reacts with cinnamic acid and produces benzaldehyde with a stoichiometry of 1 1 at ph 7 the ozone exposure o3 dt accumulated to 0 80 μm min in 90 min ozone is reactive with ppcps containing double bonds or amines huber et al 2005 thus the in situ formed ozone can contribute to the degradation of ppcps possessing these structures such as trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole propranolol naproxen carbamazepine diclofenac azithromycin venlafaxine and gemfibrozil with k values from 104 to 106 m 1 s 1 table s2 the degradation efficiencies of ppcps by the solar chlorine system depends on their reactivity with reactive species such as ho rcs ozone and chlorine ppcps in group i lack electron donating functional groups and thus their degradation should be primarily attributed to ho oxidation but not rcs kong et al 2016 guo et al 2017 or ozone huber et al 2003 ppcps in group ii and group iii contain strong electron donating functional groups which are more susceptible to rcs ozone or chlorine and thus their degradation was promoted by solar chlorine note that chlorine played the most important role in the degradation of ppcps in group iii as hocl oclˉ is reactive towards phenolic and aniline compounds guo et al 2017 3 3 effects of ph on ppcp degradation fig 3 shows the effects of ph on ppcp degradation by solar chlorine with increasing ph from 6 to 8 the degradation of 6 ppcps including metronidazole nalidixic acid atrazine ibuprofen primidone and flumequine decreased while that of 11 ppcps including dimetridazole ornidazole cyclophosphamide metoprolol chloramphenicol and bezafibrate in group i venlafaxine caffeine and carbamazepine in group ii and acetaminophen and azithromycin in group iii increased the degradation of the remaining 7 ppcps was slightly affected by ph as their removal efficiencies in 20 min reached almost 100 including gemfibrozil diclofenac naproxen and propranolol in group ii and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and triclosan in group iii the concentrations of ho and cl decreased from 1 23 10 14 m to 4 79 10 15 m and from 9 80 10 16 m to 4 31 10 16 m respectively with increasing ph from 6 to 8 whereas that of clo increased from 5 30 10 14 m to 2 68 10 13 m fig 2a that is the concentrations of ho and cl decreased by 61 and 56 respectively while that of clo increased by 405 at ph 8 compared to that at ph 6 the steady state concentrations of radicals at different ph values depend on their formation and scavenging rates increasing ph affects the distribution of hocl and ocl pka 7 5 which are also scavengers to radicals such as ho and cl in addition to the precursors fang et al 2014 the decay of free chlorine accelerated from 0 00092 min 1 to 0 00267 min 1 with increasing ph from 6 to 8 fig s7 as the absorbance of ocl at 290 nm was 10 20 times higher than that of hocl fig s1 the quantum yield of ocl 0 945 mol es 1 was higher than hocl 0 432 mol es 1 by solar photolysis at the wavelengths between 290 and 400 nm sun et al 2016 indicating that more radicals were formed with increasing ph thus the formation rate of radicals was enhanced in alkaline conditions however the radical scavenging of ho and cl by ocl was 4 4 and 2 7 times higher than those of hocl wu et al 2016 which formed the secondary radical clo this resulted in the overall lower concentrations of ho and cl but a higher concentration of clo at higher ph with increasing ph the decreasing concentrations of ho and cl could be responsible for the decreased removal efficiencies of the 6 ppcps in group i while the enhancement of clo could contribute to the accelerated degradation of some ppcps such as bezafibrate caffeine and carbamazepine guo et al 2018 kong et al 2018 the exposure of ozone o3 dt increased by 129 5 in 90 min as the ph increased from 6 to 8 fig 2b which likely contributed to the enhanced degradation of some ppcps the increasing ozone exposure with increasing ph was attributable to a higher proportion of ocl which enhanced the production of o 3p and subsequently reacted with do to generate ozone eqs 2 and 3 in addition the decomposition of ozone could be accelerated at higher ph von gunten 2003 the increment of ozone formation exceeded the decomposition with increasing ph resulting in the increase of ozone exposure with increasing ph from 6 to 8 in addition some ppcps can undergo proton transfer reactions to yield their protonated or deprotonated forms when the ph varies which may also affect their reactivity toward various oxidants in the solar chlorine system guo et al 2017 for example the degradation of propranolol pka 9 42 by chlorine was enhanced with increasing ph due to the transformation of amine from cationic to neutral forms benner et al 2008 3 4 effects of dissolved oxygen on ppcp degradation in the absence of do the degradation of most ppcps was inhibited at ph 7 0 fig 4 however the removal efficiencies of dimetridazole ornidazole nalidixic acid flumequine and metoprolol in group i increased especially for flumequine and nalidixic acid the removal efficiencies of 6 ppcps including diclofenac naproxen and propranolol in group ii and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and triclosan in group iii stayed close to 100 and were less affected by do ozone was formed through the reaction of do and o 3p in solar chlorine ulrik et al 1984 the absence of do prevented the generation of ozone resulting in the suppressed degradation of some ppcps with high reactivities toward ozone for example ozone reacts with venlafaxine and caffeine at the rate constants of 3 3 104 m 1 s 1 and 2 5 104 m 1 s 1 thus their removal rates decreased by 45 2 and 46 1 respectively without do in addition the removal efficiencies of some ppcps reached 100 in the absence of do such as gemfibrozil diclofenac and naproxen in group ii their high removal efficiencies without do can be attributed to clo as their rate constants with clo were reported to be 4 16 108 m 1 s 1 3 54 108 m 1 s 1 and 2 30 109 m 1 s 1 respectively guo et al 2018 on the other hand the enhancement of the degradation of flumequine nalidixic acid dimetridazole ornidazole and metoprolol without do might be due to their low reactivity toward ozone table s2 and possible reactivity toward o 3p the reactivity of o 3p toward pollutants has rarely been reported and need to be investigated 3 5 dbp formation in simulated drinking water tocl is a collective parameter and a toxicity indicator for all the chlorinated organic dbps in water zhu and zhang 2016 at ph 7 the formation of tocl was 202 45 μgcl l 1 and 325 29 μgcl l 1 from chlorination and solar chlorine respectively in simulated drinking water containing 2 5 mg l 1 nom in 60 min fig 5 meanwhile the total yields of known dbps including tcm dcaa tcaa ch 1 1 dcp 1 1 1 tcp dcan and tcnm were 28 61 μg l 1 and 74 21 μg l 1 in chlorination alone and solar chlorine respectively which accounted for 10 5 and 17 4 of tocl thus tocl largely contained unknown chlorinated products the chlorine residual by solar chlorine was 22 9 lower than that by chlorination fig s8 in the absence of do the yields of tocl and known dbps declined slightly by 2 3 and 12 4 respectively in solar chlorine the trend of tocl and known dbp formation in 30 min was similar to that in 60 min fig s9 the reactive species of ho and ozone can alter the properties of nom and further increase dbp formation rcs can attack the double bond and phenolic ring of nom wang et al 2017 to produce more tocl and dbps hence the significant enhancement of tocl formation in solar chlorine compared to chlorination can be ascribed to the involvement of rcs and ho the formation of tocl and known dbps did not significantly change in the absence of do indicating that the role of ozone may not be important for chlorinated dbp formation in solar chlorine the formation of tocl declined as the ph rose from 6 to 8 in chlorination and solar chlorine whereas that of known dbps showed the opposite trend with increasing ph from 6 to 8 the tocl formation slightly decreased from 212 91 μgcl l 1 to 196 74 μgcl l 1 and from 339 04 μgcl l 1 to 284 97 μgcl l 1 in chlorination and solar chlorine respectively as for known dbps the total yields at ph 6 7 and 8 were 146 7 159 3 and 149 5 higher in solar chlorine compared to those in chlorination respectively among the known dbps the yields of tcm ch dcaa and tcaa increased in both chlorination and solar chlorine with increasing ph but not those of 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 tcp the total yields of carbonaceous dbps c dbps which included tcm ch dcaa tcaa 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 tcp were 22 58 μg l 1 28 01 μg l 1 and 35 40 μg l 1 at ph 6 7 and 8 respectively in chlorination while they increased by 143 157 and 149 respectively in solar chlorine compared to chlorination nitrogenous dbps n dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans and halonitromethanes hnms were reported to possess higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than c dbps though their formation was a few orders of magnitude lower than that of c dbps muellner et al 2007 richardson et al 2007 the formation of dcan was 0 45 μg l 1 0 57 μg l 1 and 0 73 μg l 1 at ph 6 7 and 8 respectively in chlorination while it significantly increased by 322 260 and 170 respectively in solar chlorine compared to chlorination the yields of tcnm were 0 024 μg l 1 0 025 μg l 1 and 0 039 μg l 1 at ph 6 7 and 8 respectively in chlorination and they increased by 718 735 465 respectively in solar chlorine it has been reported that alkaline conditions promoted the formation of some dbps such as tcm and ch in chlorination hossein and stevens 1995 dąbrowska and nawrocki 2009 meanwhile alkaline conditions could increase the hydrolysis of some unstable dbps such as dcan 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 tcp fang et al 2010 on the other hand the relatively higher concentrations of ho and cl at lower ph may contribute to the alteration of nom to form more tocl in solar chlorine furthermore the concentrations of clo and the ozone exposure increased with increasing ph which may alter dbp precursors to promote the formation of some known dbps in the solar chlorine system such as tcm ch dcaa tcaa and tcnm 4 conclusions and engineering implications the degradation of 24 ppcps was greatly enhanced by solar chlorine compared to that by direct solar photolysis and chlorination the removal efficiencies of 12 ppcps reached 50 by solar chlorine in 20 min ho rcs cl clo and ozone were the main reactive species in the solar chlorine system as the ph rose from 6 to 8 the steady state concentrations of ho and cl decreased while that of clo the ozone exposure increased in solar chlorine the degradation of 6 ppcps dominated by ho and cl decreased with increasing ph while that of 11 ppcps dominated by clo and ozone was enhanced with increasing ph the degradation of most ppcps was suppressed without do the formation of tocl and known dbps was enhanced in solar chlorine compared to chlorination due to the involvement of ho and rcs in solar chlorine with increasing ph from 6 to 8 the formation of tocl slightly declined in both chlorination and solar chlorine whereas that of known dbps was obviously enhanced the yields of tocl and known dbps varied insignificantly in the absence of do co exposure of solar light and chlorine is commonplace in natural and engineered aquatic systems such as outdoor swimming pools surface water receiving chlorine and chlorinated wastewater this study comprehensively investigated ppcp degradation and dbp formation during the solar photolysis of free chlorine rcs cl and clo were firstly identified in the solar chlorine system and contributed to the degradation of some ppcps possessing electron rich groups the solar chlorine process effectively degraded structurally diverse ppcps due to the contributions of multiple reactive species such as ho rcs and ozone but formed more chlorinated dbps at the same time however acute toxicity did not obviously increase after solar chlorine treatment of simulated drinking water fig s10 a simulated solar light was used to well control the experimental condition in this study as the real solar light varied every day nevertheless compared with the simulated solar chlorine system the real solar chlorine system showed

19098,the solar chlorine process produces multiple reactive species by solar photolysis of chlorine which can be used as an energy efficient technology for water treatment this study investigated the effects of ph and dissolved oxygen do on the degradation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and on the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps in the solar chlorine system the degradation of 24 structurally diverse ppcps was enhanced appreciably in the solar chlorine system compared to solar irradiation and dark chlorination the reactive species in the solar chlorine system were identified to be hydroxyl radicals ho reactive chlorine species rcs i e cl and clo and ozone with increasing ph from 6 to 8 the steady state concentrations of ho and cl decreased from 1 23 10 14 m to 4 79 10 15 m and from 9 80 10 16 m to 4 31 10 16 m respectively whereas that of clo increased from 5 30 10 14 m to 2 68 10 13 m and the exposure of ozone increased from 0 44 μm min to 1 01 μm min in 90 min accordingly the removal efficiencies of 6 ppcps decreased and 11 ppcps increased the decreased removal of ppcps with increasing ph was due to the decrease in ho and cl while the increased removal was attributed to the increased clo and ozone the presence of do enhanced the degradation of most ppcps indicating the role of ozone on the degradation the formation of total organic chlorine tocl and known dbps was enhanced by 60 7 and 159 4 respectively in the solar chlorine system compared to chlorination in a simulated drinking water containing 2 5 mg l 1 natural organic matter nom as the ph rose from 6 to 8 tocl formation decreased by 16 2 while that of known dbps increased by 58 6 in solar chlorine the absence of do slightly suppressed the formation of tocl and known dbps this study illustrated the significant role of rcs in the solar chlorine system which enhanced the degradation of micropollutants but increased the formation of chlorinated dbps graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps solar chlorine disinfection byproducts dbps hydroxyl radicals ho reactive chlorine species 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are widely used in contemporary society daughton and ternes 1999 most ppcps are often released to aquatic environments and thus have been frequently detected in surface water groundwater and drinking water in the range of ng l 1 to μg l 1 sacher et al 2001 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 yang et al 2011 some ppcps are resistant to traditional water and wastewater treatment such as coagulation sedimentation filtration and biological treatment westerhoff et al 2005 some with low hydrophobicity are hardly adsorbed to activated carbon vieno et al 2007 and some without electron rich groups are hardly removed by chlorine chlorine dioxide or ozone lee and von gunten 2010 thus alternative treatment technologies for the removal of ppcps are needed uv based advanced oxidation processes aops such as uv h2o2 uv o3 uv chlorine and uv persulfate have been reported as efficient methods for ppcp removal via generation of free radicals such as hydroxyl radicals ho reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl clo and cl2 and sulfate radicals so4 esplugas et al 2002 rosenfeldt and linden 2007 wu et al 2016 xiang et al 2016 lian et al 2017 however uv based aops require uv lamps for irradiation which are accompanied by high operating costs and considerably high energy requirements for example the uv energy requirement accounts for 94 of total costs of the uv h2o2 process for 90 removal of 28 kinds of ppcps while that accounts for 10 6 90 of the uv chlorine process guo et al 2018 compared to uv light solar light is renewable and available worldwide at a much lower cost solar irradiation has been used for disinfection lonnen et al 2005 and the degradation of contaminants such as ppcps algal toxins hydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and disinfection byproducts dbps chen et al 2010 song et al 2012 ge et al 2016 yan et al 2017 recently the solar photolysis of free chlorine system solar chlorine has drawn increasing attention in water treatment for disinfection and ppcp degradation the solar chlorine system was reported to be effective at inactivating bacillus subtilis spores and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts forsyth et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 also the system showed great potential to degrade contaminants such as carbamazepine diethyltoluamide caffeine and naphthenic acids shu et al 2014 sun et al 2016 yang et al 2016 considering its reduced energy requirements and considerable treatment efficiencies the solar chlorine system may be a promising alternative to the uv chlorine system however the efficiency and mechanism of the solar chlorine system in the degradation of structurally diverse ppcps are largely unknown the major reactive species for disinfection or contaminant removal in the solar chlorine system were found to be hydroxyl radical ho and ozone o3 forsyth et al 2013 yang et al 2016 following eqs 1 3 1 hocl ocl hv ho o cl 2 ocl hv o 3p cl 3 o 3p o2 o3 however the contribution of reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl clo and cl2 to pathogen inactivation and ppcp degradation has often been neglected forsyth et al 2013 yang et al 2016 rcs have been demonstrated to play an important role in the uv chlorine process for the degradation of micropollutants such as benzoic acid trimethoprim caffeine and carbamazepine fang et al 2014 wu et al 2016 guo et al 2017 cl was directly formed via chlorine photolysis eq 1 while secondary radicals clo and cl2 were generated via eqs 4 8 wu et al 2016 currently the role of rcs has not yet been recognized in the solar chlorine system and needs further investigation 4 cl cl cl2 k for 6 5 109 m 1 s 1 k res 1 1 105 s 1 5 hocl ho clo h2o k 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 6 hocl cl clo cl h k 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 7 ocl ho clo oh k 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 8 ocl cl clo cl k 8 2 109 m 1 s 1 as discussed above the solar chlorine system contains multiple reactive species such as ho ozone and rcs the formation of these reactive species is significantly affected by ph and dissolved oxygen do ph affects the formation and consumption of reactive species by influencing the abundance of hocl and ocl pka 7 5 the molar absorption coefficient of ocl overlaps with uv region uvb and uva from 290 to 400 nm of the solar spectrum fig s1 which suggests that sunlight may be very efficient at photolyzing ocl shu et al 2014 meanwhile the scavenging of ho and cl by ocl is much higher than that by hocl eqs 5 8 wu et al 2016 the decay kinetics of ozone are also highly affected by ph von gunten 2003 do is a significant precursor in the reaction with ground state atomic oxygen o 3p to generate ozone buxton and subhani 1972 ulrik et al 1984 in addition o 3p is only generated via the photolysis of ocl and not of hocl forsyth et al 2013 thus the effects of ph and do on the oxidation chemistry and the degradation of structurally diverse ppcps need further investigation the formation of chlorinated dbps in the solar chlorine system may be different from chlorination alone due to the generation of reactive species natural organic matter nom is the most important dbp precursor during chlorination of surface water and drinking water bond et al 2009 kanan and karanfil 2011 reactive species such as ho rcs and ozone could alter the properties of nom and further affect dbp formation rcs formed in the solar chlorine system may directly react with nom to generate more chlorinated dbps like those observed in the uv chlorine system wang et al 2015 2017 the formation of chlorinated dbps from nom in the solar chlorine system and the effects of ph and do are totally unknown and need investigation the objectives of this work were 1 to evaluate the removal efficiency of many structurally diverse ppcps at practical concentrations by the solar chlorine system and to identify the reactive species such as ho rcs and ozone responsible for the degradation 2 to investigate the effects of ph and do on ppcp degradation and 3 to assess the effects of ph and do on the formation of total organic chlorine tocl and dbps twenty four typical ppcps were selected as target compounds due to their frequent occurrence in aqueous environments and included antibiotics non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs β blockers antiepileptic drugs lipid regulators antidepressants stimulants antitumor drugs herbicides and antibacterial drugs 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents

xenon lamp was employed to generate simulated sunlight experiments were conducted in a quartz reactor with rapid mixing provided which was air tight by using a quartz plug fig s2 the fluence rates at the surface of the reactor were recorded to be 18 w m 2 at 290 400 nm and 545 w m 2 at 290 800 nm by an illuminometer ocean optics usb 4000 the spectrum of the simulated sunlight is shown in fig s1 the temperature was maintained at 25 0 2 c a 250 ml testing solution containing 2 μg l 1 of each ppcp and buffered at a certain ph by 2 mm phosphate buffer was dosed with the naocl stock solution and simultaneously exposed to solar irradiation the chlorine dosage in the solution was 1 mg l 1 samples were collected after 20 min and quenched by ascorbic acid at a molar ratio of ascorbic acid to chlorine of 1 5 1 and were subsequently spiked with the isotope internal standards the samples were then subjected to solid phase extraction spe using hlb cartridges 200 mg 6 ml waters to investigate the effects of do the experiment was conducted in a similar manner under oxygen free conditions by purging with nitrogen gas for 30 min before the reaction to ensure the concentration of do less than 0 1 mg l 1 control tests of ppcp degradation by direct solar photolysis and dark chlorination were carried out in a similar manner but in the absence of chlorine and solar irradiation respectively additional tests were conducted under similar conditions to determine the concentrations of radicals ho cl and clo and the ozone exposure in the system by using probe compounds the former was conducted under oxygen free conditions by using 1 μm nb ba and dmob the latter was conducted by using 5 μm cinnamic acid another experiment was conducted by using a light filter fsq gg400 newport to filtrate light with wavelengths 400 nm to examine the contribution of light at 400 800 nm to the degradation of probe compounds and the production of reactive species in the solar chlorine system the dbps formed during chlorination and solar chlorine treatment were quantified in a simulated drinking water containing 2 5 mg l 1 nom at a chlorine dose of 100 μm after a given reaction time samples were collected and divided into four portions the first portion was analysed by dpd fas titration for the determination of chlorine residuals the second and third portions were quenched with ascorbic acid for the analyses of haas and volatile dbps respectively the fourth portion was quenched with sodium sulfite for the analyses of tocl and acute toxicity all tests were performed at least twice the error bars in all data plots represent the maximum and minimum of the experimental data of the duplicated test results 2 3 analytical methods ppcps were quantified by ultra high performance liquid chromatography mass mass spectrometry uhplc ms ms thermo tsq quantum access max a waters acquity uplc hss t3 column 2 1 mm 100 mm 1 8 μm was used to separate the ppcps details of the uhplc and mass conditions can be found in text s1 and table s1 respectively in the supporting information si nb ba dmob and benzaldehyde were determined by hplc agilent 1260 usa coupled with a diode array detector and a c 18 column proshell 4 6 mm 50 mm 2 7 μm with detection wavelengths were set at 266 nm 227 nm 227 nm and 230 nm respectively eluents of methanol and water with different ratios were used for the quantification of ba nb dmob and benzaldehyde at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the concentration of free chlorine was determined by the dpd fas titration method apha awwa wef 2012 the ph was measured by a ph meter fe20 mettler toledo and do was measured by a do meter jpsj 605f rex tocl was determined by an aox analyser xplorer te instruments analyses of volatile dbps including trichloromethane tcm chloral hydrate ch 1 1 dichloropropanone 1 1 dcp 1 1 1 trichloropropanone 1 1 1 tcp dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloronitromethane tcnm and haloacetic acids haas including dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa were carried out with a gas chromatograph agilent 7890b coupled with an electron capture detector ecd based on usepa method 551 1 and usepa method 552 3 usepa 1998 respectively an hp 5 fused silica capillary column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 μm agilent j w and a db 1701 fused silica capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent j w were used for the analyses of volatile dbps and haas respectively acute toxicity tests were conducted by using a lumistox toxicity analyser hach usa and vibrio fischeri strains the results after 30 min contact time were reported as luminescence inhibition 2 4 determination of reactive species to determine the concentrations of ho cl and clo probe compounds of nb ba and dmob were spiked in the solar chlorine system under oxygen free conditions nb only reacts with ho but not rcs while ba is only reactive with ho and cl fang et al 2014 and dmob reacts with ho cl clo and ozone alfassi et al 1988 mvula et al 2009 nist 2017 therefore the experiments were carried out in the absence of oxygen to exclude ozone in the system then ho ss cl ss and clo ss were calculated by eqs 9 11 9 k nb k ho nb ho ss 10 k ba k ho ba ho ss k cl ba cl ss 11 k dmob k ho dmob ho ss k cl dmob cl ss k clo dmob clo ss where k nb k ba and k dmob represent the pseudo first order rate constants k for the degradation of nb ba and dmob by solar chlorine respectively ho ss cl ss and clo ss represent the steady state concentrations of ho cl and clo respectively k ho nb k ho ba and k cl ba represent the second order rate constants for nb with ho ba with ho and ba with cl respectively which were reported to be 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 and 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 k ho dmob k cl dmob and k clo dmob represent the second order rate constants of dmob reacting with ho cl and clo respectively which were reported to be 7 0 109 m 1 s 1 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 and 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 alfassi et al 1988 nist 2017 note that the degradation of nb ba and dmob by either direct solar photolysis or dark chlorination was negligible fig s3 cinnamic acid was selected as a probe compound to calculate the exposure of ozone which rapidly reacted with ozone k 3 8 105 m 1 s 1 to generate benzaldehyde in a 1 1 stoichiometry leitzke et al 2001 the exposure of ozone was calculated by the production of benzaldehyde 3 results and discussion 3 1 ppcp degradation in the solar chlorine system under neutral condition fig 1 compares the removal efficiencies of ppcps by solar photolysis chlorination and solar chlorine at ph 7 0 and 1 mg l 1 chlorine in pure water in 20 min the removal efficiencies of most ppcps were negligible by direct solar photolysis chlorination was selective and was only efficient for the removal of 5 ppcps acetaminophen azithromycin trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and triclosan which had the removal efficiencies of higher than 50 compared to direct solar photolysis and chlorination the solar chlorine system was much more efficient for the removal of all ppcps which were divided into 3 groups 1 12 compounds with removal efficiencies lower than 50 by solar chlorine were defined as group i and included metronidazole dimetridazole ornidazole nalidixic acid atrazine ibuprofen primidone flumequine cyclophosphamide metoprolol chloramphenicol and bezafibrate 2 7 compounds with removal efficiencies higher than 50 by solar chlorine but not by chlorination were defined as group ii and included venlafaxine caffeine carbamazepine gemfibrozil diclofenac naproxen and propranolol 3 5 compounds with high removal efficiencies in both solar chlorine and chlorination 50 were designated group iii and included acetaminophen azithromycin trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and triclosan ppcps in group i lack electron donating functional groups while ppcps in group ii and group iii contain electron donating functional groups 3 2 identification of ho rcs and ozone in the solar chlorine system to identify different radicals of ho and rcs i e cl and clo in the solar chlorine system the probes nb ba and dmob were used together under oxygen free conditions at ph 7 k nb k ba and k dmob were determined to be 0 00176 min 1 0 00336 min 1 and 0 02558 min 1 respectively by solar chlorine fig s4 then ho ss cl ss and clo ss were calculated to be 7 52 10 15 m 6 46 10 16 m and 1 72 10 13 m respectively fig 2 a the concentration of cl was about one order of magnitude lower than that of ho while the concentration of clo was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of ho and cl the high concentration of clo resulted in its high contribution to the degradation of ppcps containing electron donating functional groups such as caffeine carbamazepine and gemfibrozil with second order rate constants higher than 108 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2018 the degradation of nb ba and dmob was insignificant after filtering the light under 400 nm fig s5 indicating that the light ranging from 400 to 800 nm had little contribution to the production of reactive species the uv fluence rate at 290 400 nm of the real solar light was higher than that of the simulated solar light the former was 43 2 w m 2 while the latter was 18 w m 2 fig s1 the degradation rates of the probes nb ba and dmob by solar chlorine using real solar light were obviously higher than that using simulated solar light under oxygen free conditions figs s4 and s6 accordingly ho ss cl ss and clo ss were determined to be 1 42 10 13 m 1 30 10 14 m and 1 11 10 12 m respectively in the real solar chlorine system fig 2a which were 18 9 20 1 and 6 5 times of those in simulated solar chlorine system respectively this result indicates that real solar light is more effective for the production of reactive species than the simulated solar light in the solar chlorine system note that ho ss cl ss and clo ss in the uv chlorine system are in the range of 10 13 m 10 14 m and 10 10 m at the similar chlorine dosage respectively under the uv fluence rate at 254 nm of 7 8 w m 2 guo et al 2017 which are 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than those in the solar chlorine system at the fluence rate of light at 290 400 nm of 18 w m 2 from the simulated solar light the higher production of radicals by uv chlorine is higher than that by solar chlorine regardless of the operation costs however the formation of ozone in solar chlorine can benefit the degradation of some ppcps ozone is reported to be a reactive species in the solar chlorine system in the presence of do yang et al 2016 cinnamic acid was used as a probe to investigate the production of ozone in the solar chlorine system ozone reacts with cinnamic acid and produces benzaldehyde with a stoichiometry of 1 1 at ph 7 the ozone exposure o3 dt accumulated to 0 80 μm min in 90 min ozone is reactive with ppcps containing double bonds or amines huber et al 2005 thus the in situ formed ozone can contribute to the degradation of ppcps possessing these structures such as trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole propranolol naproxen carbamazepine diclofenac azithromycin venlafaxine and gemfibrozil with k values from 104 to 106 m 1 s 1 table s2 the degradation efficiencies of ppcps by the solar chlorine system depends on their reactivity with reactive species such as ho rcs ozone and chlorine ppcps in group i lack electron donating functional groups and thus their degradation should be primarily attributed to ho oxidation but not rcs kong et al 2016 guo et al 2017 or ozone huber et al 2003 ppcps in group ii and group iii contain strong electron donating functional groups which are more susceptible to rcs ozone or chlorine and thus their degradation was promoted by solar chlorine note that chlorine played the most important role in the degradation of ppcps in group iii as hocl oclˉ is reactive towards phenolic and aniline compounds guo et al 2017 3 3 effects of ph on ppcp degradation fig 3 shows the effects of ph on ppcp degradation by solar chlorine with increasing ph from 6 to 8 the degradation of 6 ppcps including metronidazole nalidixic acid atrazine ibuprofen primidone and flumequine decreased while that of 11 ppcps including dimetridazole ornidazole cyclophosphamide metoprolol chloramphenicol and bezafibrate in group i venlafaxine caffeine and carbamazepine in group ii and acetaminophen and azithromycin in group iii increased the degradation of the remaining 7 ppcps was slightly affected by ph as their removal efficiencies in 20 min reached almost 100 including gemfibrozil diclofenac naproxen and propranolol in group ii and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and triclosan in group iii the concentrations of ho and cl decreased from 1 23 10 14 m to 4 79 10 15 m and from 9 80 10 16 m to 4 31 10 16 m respectively with increasing ph from 6 to 8 whereas that of clo increased from 5 30 10 14 m to 2 68 10 13 m fig 2a that is the concentrations of ho and cl decreased by 61 and 56 respectively while that of clo increased by 405 at ph 8 compared to that at ph 6 the steady state concentrations of radicals at different ph values depend on their formation and scavenging rates increasing ph affects the distribution of hocl and ocl pka 7 5 which are also scavengers to radicals such as ho and cl in addition to the precursors fang et al 2014 the decay of free chlorine accelerated from 0 00092 min 1 to 0 00267 min 1 with increasing ph from 6 to 8 fig s7 as the absorbance of ocl at 290 nm was 10 20 times higher than that of hocl fig s1 the quantum yield of ocl 0 945 mol es 1 was higher than hocl 0 432 mol es 1 by solar photolysis at the wavelengths between 290 and 400 nm sun et al 2016 indicating that more radicals were formed with increasing ph thus the formation rate of radicals was enhanced in alkaline conditions however the radical scavenging of ho and cl by ocl was 4 4 and 2 7 times higher than those of hocl wu et al 2016 which formed the secondary radical clo this resulted in the overall lower concentrations of ho and cl but a higher concentration of clo at higher ph with increasing ph the decreasing concentrations of ho and cl could be responsible for the decreased removal efficiencies of the 6 ppcps in group i while the enhancement of clo could contribute to the accelerated degradation of some ppcps such as bezafibrate caffeine and carbamazepine guo et al 2018 kong et al 2018 the exposure of ozone o3 dt increased by 129 5 in 90 min as the ph increased from 6 to 8 fig 2b which likely contributed to the enhanced degradation of some ppcps the increasing ozone exposure with increasing ph was attributable to a higher proportion of ocl which enhanced the production of o 3p and subsequently reacted with do to generate ozone eqs 2 and 3 in addition the decomposition of ozone could be accelerated at higher ph von gunten 2003 the increment of ozone formation exceeded the decomposition with increasing ph resulting in the increase of ozone exposure with increasing ph from 6 to 8 in addition some ppcps can undergo proton transfer reactions to yield their protonated or deprotonated forms when the ph varies which may also affect their reactivity toward various oxidants in the solar chlorine system guo et al 2017 for example the degradation of propranolol pka 9 42 by chlorine was enhanced with increasing ph due to the transformation of amine from cationic to neutral forms benner et al 2008 3 4 effects of dissolved oxygen on ppcp degradation in the absence of do the degradation of most ppcps was inhibited at ph 7 0 fig 4 however the removal efficiencies of dimetridazole ornidazole nalidixic acid flumequine and metoprolol in group i increased especially for flumequine and nalidixic acid the removal efficiencies of 6 ppcps including diclofenac naproxen and propranolol in group ii and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and triclosan in group iii stayed close to 100 and were less affected by do ozone was formed through the reaction of do and o 3p in solar chlorine ulrik et al 1984 the absence of do prevented the generation of ozone resulting in the suppressed degradation of some ppcps with high reactivities toward ozone for example ozone reacts with venlafaxine and caffeine at the rate constants of 3 3 104 m 1 s 1 and 2 5 104 m 1 s 1 thus their removal rates decreased by 45 2 and 46 1 respectively without do in addition the removal efficiencies of some ppcps reached 100 in the absence of do such as gemfibrozil diclofenac and naproxen in group ii their high removal efficiencies without do can be attributed to clo as their rate constants with clo were reported to be 4 16 108 m 1 s 1 3 54 108 m 1 s 1 and 2 30 109 m 1 s 1 respectively guo et al 2018 on the other hand the enhancement of the degradation of flumequine nalidixic acid dimetridazole ornidazole and metoprolol without do might be due to their low reactivity toward ozone table s2 and possible reactivity toward o 3p the reactivity of o 3p toward pollutants has rarely been reported and need to be investigated 3 5 dbp formation in simulated drinking water tocl is a collective parameter and a toxicity indicator for all the chlorinated organic dbps in water zhu and zhang 2016 at ph 7 the formation of tocl was 202 45 μgcl l 1 and 325 29 μgcl l 1 from chlorination and solar chlorine respectively in simulated drinking water containing 2 5 mg l 1 nom in 60 min fig 5 meanwhile the total yields of known dbps including tcm dcaa tcaa ch 1 1 dcp 1 1 1 tcp dcan and tcnm were 28 61 μg l 1 and 74 21 μg l 1 in chlorination alone and solar chlorine respectively which accounted for 10 5 and 17 4 of tocl thus tocl largely contained unknown chlorinated products the chlorine residual by solar chlorine was 22 9 lower than that by chlorination fig s8 in the absence of do the yields of tocl and known dbps declined slightly by 2 3 and 12 4 respectively in solar chlorine the trend of tocl and known dbp formation in 30 min was similar to that in 60 min fig s9 the reactive species of ho and ozone can alter the properties of nom and further increase dbp formation rcs can attack the double bond and phenolic ring of nom wang et al 2017 to produce more tocl and dbps hence the significant enhancement of tocl formation in solar chlorine compared to chlorination can be ascribed to the involvement of rcs and ho the formation of tocl and known dbps did not significantly change in the absence of do indicating that the role of ozone may not be important for chlorinated dbp formation in solar chlorine the formation of tocl declined as the ph rose from 6 to 8 in chlorination and solar chlorine whereas that of known dbps showed the opposite trend with increasing ph from 6 to 8 the tocl formation slightly decreased from 212 91 μgcl l 1 to 196 74 μgcl l 1 and from 339 04 μgcl l 1 to 284 97 μgcl l 1 in chlorination and solar chlorine respectively as for known dbps the total yields at ph 6 7 and 8 were 146 7 159 3 and 149 5 higher in solar chlorine compared to those in chlorination respectively among the known dbps the yields of tcm ch dcaa and tcaa increased in both chlorination and solar chlorine with increasing ph but not those of 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 tcp the total yields of carbonaceous dbps c dbps which included tcm ch dcaa tcaa 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 tcp were 22 58 μg l 1 28 01 μg l 1 and 35 40 μg l 1 at ph 6 7 and 8 respectively in chlorination while they increased by 143 157 and 149 respectively in solar chlorine compared to chlorination nitrogenous dbps n dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans and halonitromethanes hnms were reported to possess higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than c dbps though their formation was a few orders of magnitude lower than that of c dbps muellner et al 2007 richardson et al 2007 the formation of dcan was 0 45 μg l 1 0 57 μg l 1 and 0 73 μg l 1 at ph 6 7 and 8 respectively in chlorination while it significantly increased by 322 260 and 170 respectively in solar chlorine compared to chlorination the yields of tcnm were 0 024 μg l 1 0 025 μg l 1 and 0 039 μg l 1 at ph 6 7 and 8 respectively in chlorination and they increased by 718 735 465 respectively in solar chlorine it has been reported that alkaline conditions promoted the formation of some dbps such as tcm and ch in chlorination hossein and stevens 1995 dąbrowska and nawrocki 2009 meanwhile alkaline conditions could increase the hydrolysis of some unstable dbps such as dcan 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 tcp fang et al 2010 on the other hand the relatively higher concentrations of ho and cl at lower ph may contribute to the alteration of nom to form more tocl in solar chlorine furthermore the concentrations of clo and the ozone exposure increased with increasing ph which may alter dbp precursors to promote the formation of some known dbps in the solar chlorine system such as tcm ch dcaa tcaa and tcnm 4 conclusions and engineering implications the degradation of 24 ppcps was greatly enhanced by solar chlorine compared to that by direct solar photolysis and chlorination the removal efficiencies of 12 ppcps reached 50 by solar chlorine in 20 min ho rcs cl clo and ozone were the main reactive species in the solar chlorine system as the ph rose from 6 to 8 the steady state concentrations of ho and cl decreased while that of clo the ozone exposure increased in solar chlorine the degradation of 6 ppcps dominated by ho and cl decreased with increasing ph while that of 11 ppcps dominated by clo and ozone was enhanced with increasing ph the degradation of most ppcps was suppressed without do the formation of tocl and known dbps was enhanced in solar chlorine compared to chlorination due to the involvement of ho and rcs in solar chlorine with increasing ph from 6 to 8 the formation of tocl slightly declined in both chlorination and solar chlorine whereas that of known dbps was obviously enhanced the yields of tocl and known dbps varied insignificantly in the absence of do co exposure of solar light and chlorine is commonplace in natural and engineered aquatic systems such as outdoor swimming pools surface water receiving chlorine and chlorinated wastewater this study comprehensively investigated ppcp degradation and dbp formation during the solar photolysis of free chlorine rcs cl and clo were firstly identified in the solar chlorine system and contributed to the degradation of some ppcps possessing electron rich groups the solar chlorine process effectively degraded structurally diverse ppcps due to the contributions of multiple reactive species such as ho rcs and ozone but formed more chlorinated dbps at the same time however acute toxicity did not obviously increase after solar chlorine treatment of simulated drinking water fig s10 a simulated solar light was used to well control the experimental condition in this study as the real solar light varied every day nevertheless compared with the simulated solar chlorine system the real solar chlorine system showed better performance for the degradation of probe compounds with the presence and absence of do figs s4 s6 and s11 accordingly the steady state concentrations of ho cl and clo were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in the simulated solar chlorine system this study illustrated that the solar chlorine system is a promising emerging strategy for efficient degradation of ppcps in water

19099,transformation of industrial chemicals might be a significant source of hitherto unknown persistent and mobile organic contaminants pmoc pm chemicals present in the aquatic environment herein we depicted a three step strategy consisting of i the prioritization of potential pmoc precursors among reach registered chemicals ii their lab scale transformation through hydrolysis photolysis mno2 oxidation and biotransformation and subsequent structural elucidation of derived transformation products and finally iii the assessment of their environmental relevance the proposed procedure was utilized to investigate eleven chemicals for nine of which a concentration reduction was observed for six of these chemicals transformation products were at least tentatively identified and partially confirmed with a commercially available reference standard retrospective assessment of high performance liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry data as well as a target screening method for the identified tps and some of the prioritized reach chemicals revealed the widespread presence of the following chemicals in the environment 2 pyrrolidone hydrolysis product of vinylpyrrolidone tp 216 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 acetic acid biotransformation product of 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 ethanol and 1 3 diphenylguanidine prioritized chemical with experimental evidence of environmental stability 2 pyrrolidone was detected in 23 25 investigated surface water samples and present in concentrations of up to 400 ng l tp 216 was detected in 20 25 surface water samples and an additional sampling of a waste water treatment plant and the receiving surface water confirmed that tp 216 is formed in waste water treatment plants the vulcanisation agent 1 3 diphenylguanidine was present in all investigated samples a leaching experiment with a tire suggested that tires and thus tire wear particles are a potential source of 1 3 diphenylguanidine with these data the depicted approach was proven successful and suitable for true unknowns like tp 216 and thus an alternative to non target screenings or suspect screenings with predicted tps to identify environmentally relevant transformation products graphical abstract image 1 keywords persistent and mobile organic chemicals pmoc pm chemicals biotransformation hydrolysis photolysis mno2 oxidation prioritization of reach chemicals semi quantitative target screening surface water 1 introduction tens of thousands of anthropogenic chemicals of which the majority is neither regulated nor regularly monitored or even still unknown are expected to be present in the aquatic environment daughton 2004 schwarzenbach et al 2006 the most polar and persistent of these chemicals herein referred to as persistent and mobile organic compounds pmoc reemtsma et al 2016 and alternatively known as persistent and mobile and potentially toxic substances pm t substances neumann 2017 are able to penetrate natural and artificial barriers spread quickly in the aquatic environment and might reach drinking water while the overall contamination of water with anthropogenic chemicals decreases from waste water treatment plant wwtp effluent to finished drinking water the relevance of polar chemicals increases along the water cycle sjerps et al 2016 despite the increasing scientific dulio et al 2018 schmidt 2018 and regulatory neumann 2017 interest in very polar water contaminants many of them are still expected to be unknown and thus a knowledge gap reemtsma et al 2016 exists for these micropollutants natural and artificial transformation processes commonly result in transformation products tps with increasing polarity until either mineralization is achieved or dead end transformation products are formed and thus many tps are expected among the yet unknown pmoc in recent years considerable effort has been put into narrowing the knowledge gap for pmoc through suspect bieber et al 2017 deeb et al 2017 gago ferrero et al 2018 gago ferrero et al 2015 montes et al 2017 and non target gago ferrero et al 2015 ruff et al 2015 schluesener et al 2015 zahn et al 2016 screening approaches which led to the successful identification of numerous novel water contaminants predicted tps have been included in suspect screenings bletsou 2015 but this approach suffers from the inherent uncertainty in tp prediction which may lead to the omission of tps and the combinatorial explosion which results in a rapid growth of the number of predicted tps when their formation in increasingly complex environmental systems is predicted and thus in a high potential for false positives true unknowns which are not present in databases are thus problematic to include in suspect screenings and are exceedingly difficult to identify hollender et al 2017 once detected in non target screenings unknown tps belong to the group of true unknowns and are consequently rarely identified in non target screening approaches in fact tps often only come into the analytical focus and find their way onto suspect lists and chemical databases after their precursor attracted sufficient attention from the scientific community and was thus investigated in detail this leads to a discrepancy between the relatively low number of identified novel tps through suspect and non target screenings and their supposedly high contribution to the total pmoc load in raw and drinking waters that is insufficiently addressed by most commonly deployed analytical approaches in an effort to reduce this gap in knowledge we utilized a three step approach to identify novel polar transformation products consisting of i a prioritization of potential pmoc precursors among reach registered chemicals based on their mobility persistency and emission data that was performed by arp et al 2017 and schulze et al 2018 followed by manual selection from the resulting shortlist ii the identification of tps of these precursors derived by hydrolysis photolysis mno2 oxidation and biotransformation and finally iii the assessment of their environmental relevance with retrospective hrms data evaluation and qualitative semi quantitative analytical data generated from 25 hessian surface water samples in recent years several studies successfully utilized databases for analyte prioritization and subsequent suspect gago ferrero et al 2018 montes et al 2017 or target screenings mclachlan et al 2014 schulze et al submitted however to the best of our knowledge this is the first time such a prioritization approach is deployed to specifically investigate potential precursors of environmentally relevant tps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials 3 aminomethyl 3 5 5

the identification of tps formed during hydrolysis photolysis mno2 oxidation or biotransformation and the assessment of the environmental occurrence of identified tps was deployed to identify environmentally relevant polar transformation products of reach registered chemicals the individual steps are detailed in the following chapters 3 1 prioritization analyte selection is the first crucial step in the identification of transformation derived mobile and persistent water contaminants and requires accurate predictions about the physico chemical properties of chemicals most notably polarity and persistency against all kinds of environmental transformation processes and is thus inherently complex as a first selection step we utilized the work of arp et al 2017 which aimed to identify pmoc and potential precursors thereof among reach registered chemicals and schulze et al 2018 which later on refined that list by the introduction of emission scores and thus allowed an incorporation of the likelihood of environmental emissions based on production volumes and use data for a detailed description of these first prioritization steps please refer to the respective publications after removal of well studied chemicals from the resulting short list of presumed pmoc precursors the final selection took esi amenability and standard availability into account eleven of the remaining chemicals were selected for transformation experiments table 1 3 2 transformation and identification the environmental stability of the selected chemicals was simulated in lab scale hydrolysis photolysis mno2 oxidation and biotransformation experiments table 1 investigated transformation processes were selected to cover the most relevant transformation processes from the emission of a chemical into the aquatic environment mostly through waste water treatment plants to its occurrence in raw waters used for drinking water production thus hydrolysis all compartments of the water cycle photolysis mostly surface waters mno2 oxidation simulation of oxidation on mineral surfaces during infiltration and biotransformation most compartments of the water cycle but most notably waste water treatment plants were deemed relevant purely artificial transformation processes like ozonation were out of scope of this research for two chemicals bga and eht no concentration reduction was observed during the experiments and thus they were stable under the test conditions while a reduction in concentration was observed for the other nine chemicals transformation products were only identified for six of them vp pea doss mtsc htmpe and dpg potential explanations for a concentration reduction of the precursors without the emergence of transformation products are mineralization sorption of either the precursor substance or the formed tp and the formation of transformation products not amenable to esi ms neither tps that are readily adsorbed nor tps not amenable to esi ms are of interest in the context of this research and thus amch hmta and thei are not further discussed herein all detected tps are discussed in detail in the following sections 3 2 1 hydrolysis derived tps n vinylpyrrolidone vp the monomer of the widely deployed polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone and otherwise used in washing and cleaning products echa a underwent hydrolysis under neutral ph 7 t1 2 1 5 days and acidic ph 4 t1 2 5 days conditions resulting in the formation of tp 86 esi m z 86 0600 fig 2 the identification strategy utilized for most tps is visualized on the example of tp 86 in fig s1 and discussed hereinafter hrms data exact mass δ 0 8 ppm and 13c isotopic pattern suggested an elemental composition of c4h8no identification level 4 during ms hrms experiments a cleavage of nh3 and h2o was observed the knowledge that tp 86 is derived from vp the ms hrms data and an h d exchange experiment that proved the presence of one exchangeable hydrogen atom in the neutral structure led to the conclusion that tp 86 is formed by hydrolysis between the vinyl moiety and the nitrogen atom resulting in 2 pyrrolidone id level 2 which was later confirmed with an authentic reference material fig 2 table s8 id level 1 2 pyrrolidone is intentionally produced and used in inks and toners surface treatment products paper production washing and cleaning products as chemical precursor to vinylpyrrolidone and other industrial chemicals and as high boiling point organic solvent echa b however its potential formation by hydrolysis of n vinylpyrrolidone may enable new entry pathways into the environment for this compound dioctyl sulfosuccinate doss which is used as ingredient of coatings filters washing and cleaning products paints adhesives and sealants echa c only underwent hydrolysis at alkaline ph ph 9 t1 2 4 75 days and appears to be otherwise hydrolytically stable for extended periods of time the resulting tp 309 esi m z 309 1014 was assigned an elemental composition of c12h21o7s based on its exact mass δ 0 3 ppm and the isotopic fine structure of 13c 18o and 34s ms hrms data experimental evidence and the presence of one exchangeable hydrogen atom led to the proposed structures for tp 309 fig s2 table s9 id level 2 which are formed by hydrolysis of either of the ester groups a differentiation between both positional isomers derived by hydrolysis at one of both ester groups was not possible with the data at hand and thus both or either of them might be formed during hydrolysis of doss tp 309 has been identified by batchu et al batchu et al 2014 when they studied the behaviour of doss in marine systems in the context of the deep water horizon incident where doss was deployed as main ingredient of a chemical dispersant however data about tp 309 in freshwater systems is to the best of our knowledge not available 4 methylthiosemicarbazide mtsc an educt in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other chemicals echa d was hydrolytically stable under acidic conditions but underwent hydrolysis in neutral ph 7 t1 2 8 25 days and alkaline solution ph 9 t1 2 1 day a transformation product tp 92 with an m z of 92 0164 was detected with hilic esi hrms after hydrolysis fig 2 isotopologues for 13c 33s and 34s indicated the presence of approximately two c and one s and in combination with the exact mass of tp 92 δ 0 2 ppm indicated an elemental composition of c2h6ons this elemental composition and the precursor structure are consistent with hydrolysis at the hydrazine moiety under formation of a hydroxy group at the carbon atom of the thiocarboxyl group an assumption that is further sustained by cleavage of water and a hydroxyl radical two indicators for the presence of a hydroxyl moiety upon fragmentation of tp 92 the proposed structure was further confirmed with h d exchange experiments that demonstrated the presence of two exchangeable hydrogen atoms in the neutral structure which is in compliance with the structure proposal fig 2 fig s3 table s10 id level 2 however under acidic conditions only one exchangeable hydrogen atom was observed which may be explained by the calculated pka of 4 04 chemicalize https chemicalize com of the hydroxyl group consequently limiting its h d exchange under acidic conditions tp 92 underwent further hydrolysis within the test duration and reached its peak concentration after 4 days and 1 day at ph 7 and ph 9 respectively no hydrolysis product of tp 92 was detected and thus it may have undergone mineralization or fell outside of the mass range of the deployed orbitrap with a lower m z limit of 50 due to its fast hydrolysis especially under alkaline conditions tp 92 was not considered as potential pmoc and thus omitted during further investigations 3 2 2 photolysis derived tps among the tested chemicals the formation of transformation products after simulated solar irradiation was only observed for dpg and pea vp doss and mtsc were also degraded but at slow rates compared to hydrolysis which was thus assumed to be the dominant degradation pathway in the aquatic environment dpg is mainly used as a primary accelerator in the vulcanisation of rubber during which it is incorporated in the rubber compound fishbein 1991 dpg was not degraded for 7 days at ph 4 at the experimental conditions fig 3 slow photolysis occurred at ph 7 k 0 0415 d 1 with t1 2 16 5 d the rate constant was one order of magnitude higher at ph 9 k 0 475 d 1 with t1 2 1 5 d which is in agreement with a stronger light absorption of neutral dpg pka 10 12 at ph 9 for wavelengths 300 nm see uv visible absorption spectra in fig s4 a transformation product tp 210 was detected with an m z of 210 1029 by lc hrms after 3 days of irradiation at ph 7 and after 5 days at ph 9 the exact mass of tp 210 is in compliance to the ion formula c13h12n3 theoretical m z 210 1026 δ 1 6 ppm the loss of two hydrogen atoms compared to the parent compound suggests that tp 210 may be formed by intramolecular photocyclization of dpg but no structure could be derived from ms hrms data table s11 fig 3 id level 4 based on our results dpg is not expected to be photodegraded in the aquatic environment under neutral and acidic conditions and the detection of tp 210 is unlikely since it was only detected at trace levels max area 2 relative to the initial area of dpg the expected low extent of photodegradation of dpg in combination with its stability against hydrolysis and biotransformation and its similarity to di o tolylguanidine a novel pmoc recently identified by montes et al 2017 suggest that dpg itself might be a pmoc and thus warrants further investigation pea is used in adhesives and sealants coating products paints ad polymers echa e pea was transformed in presence of oxygen t½ 7 days for 9 mg o2 l at ph 7 fig 3 no transformation was observed in absence of oxygen or in presence of 50 mm furfuryl alcohol used as a scavenger of singlet oxygen 1o2 these results indicate that pea was transformed by reaction with 1o2 produced by an energy transfer between triplet state pea and molecular oxygen a reaction product tp 160 with m z 160 1080 was detected by hilic hrms after 2 days max 4 relative to the initial area of pea after 7 days the ionic sum formula c6h14n3o2 m z 160 1080 δ 0 3 ppm was assigned to tp 160 and a molecular structure was proposed from ms hrms fragmentation data losses of h2o and co indicated the presence of both hydroxyl and carbonyl groups according to the photooxygenation of n heterocyclic compounds iesce et al 2005 the formation of tp 160 could be explained by singlet oxygenation of pea via cycloaddition producing an unstable peroxide which further decomposed by cleavage of the oo bond oxygenation probably occurred on the two adjacent carbon atoms although this could not be confirmed by ms hrms data id level 3 fig s5 table s12 like pea fluoroquinolones have a piperazine ring and showed similar self sensitized photooxidation with amine side chain degradative oxidation iesce et al 2005 li and hu 2018 niu et al 2016 the weak signal of tp 160 max 4 of precursor area at t0 compared to the transformation yield of pea suggests either a weak esi response or that other reactions like chain cleavage occurred but these tps were not detected under our analytical conditions like for fluoroquinolones photodegradation of pea can be an important process but its rate of reaction in the aquatic environment will strongly depend on the concentration and chemical composition of dissolved organic matter acting as photosensitizer and light filter niu et al 2016 porras et al 2016 sturini et al 2012 3 2 3 mno2 oxidation derived tps although several compounds were removed during batch experiments with mno2 tps were only detected for pea pea was completely transformed after 15 min empty bed residence time in an mno2 column and three tps were detected tp 126 tp 142 and tp 160 fig 4 tp 160 had the same retention time and ms hrms fragmentation as the one detected during photolysis of pea the exact masses of tp 126 m z 126 1025 and tp 142 m z 142 0973 point to the ion formula c6h12n3 m z 126 1026 δ 0 6 ppm fig s6 table s13 and c6h12n3o m z 142 097 δ 1 3 ppm fig s7 table s14 respectively tentative elucidation of molecular structures was done with ms hrms data and proposed structures are given in fig 4 id level 3 compared to pea tp 126 lost four hydrogen atoms and showed only one fragment with m z 71 0600 suggesting that the primary amino group was converted to an imino group thus tp 126 would be formed by oxidative dehydrogenation of the primary amine and piperazine ring tp 126 further underwent hydroxylation of the piperazine ring and additional oxidation to a carbonyl compound leading to the formation of tp 142 the oxidation of the imino group to an amide was not observed compared to tp 126 and tp 142 the loss of nh3 in the ms hrms data of tp 160 indicated that the primary amine was preserved diamino compounds like pea are susceptible to transformation by mno2 with cleavage of the central cc bond resulting in n formyl compounds curragh et al 1960 henbest and thomas 1957 similar to photolysis such tps of pea are likely to be formed in the presence of mno2 but they were not detected in our study similar reactions of hydroxylation and cleavage of the cc bond of the piperazine ring were also proposed for the oxidation of fluoroquinolones by mno2 zhang and huang 2005 3 2 4 biotransformation derived tps 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 ethanol htmpe which is used in the manufacturing of chemicals and plastic products echa f was the only investigated analyte that underwent significant primary biotransformation under the experimental conditions htmpe was transformed quickly t1 2 1 2 days into tp 216 esi m z 216 1595 that was assigned the elemental composition of c11h22o3n based on its exact mass δ 0 3 ppm and 13c and 18o isotopic pattern which suggested an oxidation of htmpe during ms hrms analysis the presence of a c2h6o2n fragment indicated an oxidation close to the nitrogen atom and h d exchange experiments were consistent with two exchangeable hydrogen atoms in the neutral structure which was strong evidence against the formation of a third hydroxyl moiety and simultaneous formation of a double bond thus an oxidation of the ethanol moiety to a carboxylic acid was deemed the most probable fig 5 fig s8 table s15 id level 3 tp 216 was stable in the inoculum for at least 4 weeks indicating persistency against hydrolysis and further biotransformation since no additional tps were observed and the combined relative area of htmpe and tp 216 remained constant throughout the experiment between 0 9 and 1 05 see figure s9 it was assumed that tp 216 is the main if not only biotransformation product of htmpe the low maximum intensity of tp 216 which was only 20 of its precursor was attributed to a reduced esi response to the best of our knowledge tp 216 has to this point not been reported as transformation product of htmpe or as environmental contaminant 3 3 confirmation of environmental occurrence all in all nine tps were detected during lab scale transformation experiments however due to the inherent complexity of natural systems and the uncertain environmental presence of the precursors the detection in laboratory experiments does not necessarily imply the presence of these tps in the environment once a tp has been successfully identified it can be retrospectively searched for in existing hrms data or be included in suspect or target screening campaigns to assess its environmental occurrence 3 3 1 retrospective evaluation of hrms data the identified tps were retrospectively screened for in hrms data generated during a previous non target screening campaign zahn et al 2016 screening criteria were the exact mass and isotopologues dpg bga 2 pyrrolidone tp 86 tp 309 tp 126 tp 142 tp 160 and tp 216 were screened for tp 216 was potentially detected in two samples but could not be confirmed since no ms hrms data was recorded for this compound dpg 53 of samples and 2 pyrrolidone 100 of samples were the most frequently detected analytes a retrospective assessment of the prioritization and identification process during the initial non target screening revealed that 2 pyrrolidone was excluded early on during the data processing since it did not meet the requirement of an at least tenfold blankintensity that is frequently imposed on non target screening data this demonstrates that high blanks can be a significant issue in non target screenings and may lead to the exclusion of widely present analytes 3 3 2 semi quantitative target screening to more accurately and sensitively assess the presence of the nine tps bga and dpg in the aquatic environment a hilic uhplc smrm method was developed analytes were tuned from isolated hplc fractions or if available from standard solutions the sample preparation method involving the evaporation of the aqueous matrix in a vacuum centrifuge at 50 c and 9 mbar was adopted from köke et al 2018 this method was utilized to semi quantify the analytes in 25 hessian surface waters fig 6 apparent recoveries of each analyte were approximated by the mean apparent recovery of three spiked surface water samples and blank concentrations were assessed with ten independent blank replicates the developed method was suitable for dpg bga 2 pyrrolidone tp 309 tp 142 tp 160 and tp 216 these elevated temperatures accelerated hydrolysis rates which was only relevant for 2 pyrrolidone for which consequently not necessarily current concentrations but rather the formation potential in the water samples was assessed method validation was not performed nor were commercial standards available for many of the analytes and thus only semi quantitative information can be generated with this method consequently given concentrations represent approximations rather than exact values neither tp of pea tp 142 and tp 160 nor tp 309 were detected in any of the surface water samples which might be related to the high blank signals of tp 309 or the sample selection in case of pea tps that are assumed to form during the subsurface passage tp 216 fig 6a was detected in 80 of the surface water samples in estimated equivalent concentrations estimated against calibration of precursor of up to 90 ng l these concentrations however are likely underestimations given the approximately fivefold lower esi response of tp 216 compared to its precursor that was evident from the biotransformation experiment if complete conversion of htmpe to tp 216 is assumed surface water 13 in which the highest tp 216 concentrations were observed was sampled again to determine the source of tp 216 grab samples were taken at two different time points after the source of the river and before and after a connected wwtp 24 h composite samples of the influent and effluent of the wwtp were taken in parallel to the surface water samples this second sampling campaign revealed that the concentrations of tp 216 in surface water 13 were significantly lower than during the first sampling which might indicate seasonal variations that tp 216 is formed in the wwtp and that wwtps can act as point source for tp 216 semi quantification of 2 pyrrolidone was aggravated by a significant blank that was also observed during the retrospective analysis of hrms data and thus consequently leads to comparatively high limits of detection and quantification nevertheless 2 pyrrolidone was detected in all but two surface water samples 92 and blank corrected concentrations of several hundreds of ng l 2 pyrrolidone was detected as odorous compound in wwtps in the mg l range agus et al 2011 but to the best of our knowledge so far not described in aquatic environment 2 pyrrolidone might be directly discharged or formed by hydrolysis of n vinylpyrrolidone it is not known to be persistent echa b however the widespread occurrence in high concentrations may warrant further investigation dpg was detected in every investigated surface water sample and was predominantly present in the double digit ng l range which is in compliance to its widespread detection during the retrospective analysis of hrms data and even exceeds it likely due to the increased sensitivity of the target screening approach dpg has previously been detected in chinese drinking water where migration from high density polyethylene pipes was identified as its source tang et al 2015 but has not gained much attention as environmental contaminant thus far this widespread detection of dpg during the target screening and retrospective analysis of hrms data raises the question of its source since dpg is mainly used as vulcanisation agent in rubber products and especially tires and tire wear particles was found to be one of the main sources of microplastic particles in the environment with an estimated global emission of approximately 6 106 t a kole et al 2017 a contamination of the aquatic environment with dpg through leaching from tire wear particles was hypothesized dpg leaching was confirmed when a new tire was immersed in deionized water the dpg concentration in the water increased steadily and reached its maximum of approximately 140 μg l after 1 week figure s10 thus identifying tires and tire wear particles as potential source of dpg in the aquatic environment in fact the vastly increased surface area of tire wear particles compared to an intact tire might increase the leaching rate considerably and depending on the presence of a local sewage system tire wear particles or chemicals leached from it might reach the aquatic environment untreated wagner et al 2018 4 conclusions of 11 prioritized chemicals nine were degraded during the transformation experiments tps were at least tentatively identified and two of these tps along with one prioritized chemical were found to be widespread in the aquatic environment this demonstrates the potential of this approach to identify environmentally relevant tps the prioritization process and the transformation procedures investigated can be modified to tailor this approach to the question at hand given the uncertainty of persistency mobility and emission prediction of reach chemicals in the absence of reliable experimental data and the inherent complexity of environmental transformation processes confirmation of the environmental occurrence is essential the results for 2 pyrrolidone for which the high blank signal would lead to an automatic exclusion in many non target screening procedures and tp 216 which as a true unknown would be inherently difficult to identify without knowledge of its precursor structure demonstrate the complementarity of the analytical approach depicted herein with suspect and non target screenings while the laborious experimental work severely limits the number of chemicals that can be processed in comparison to suspect and non target screenings it was demonstrated that a sophisticated prioritization and experimental workflow may lead to the identification of environmentally relevant tps that slip through other screening approaches and thus enable the identification of otherwise elusive novel tps leaching from tires and consequently tire wear particles was identified as a potential source of the wide spread environmental contaminant dpg further experiments and monitoring are required to assess the relevance of this entrance pathway given the large quantity of tire wear particles estimated global amount 6 106 t a and the complex composition of tires leachables from tire wear particles might be a significant yet scarcely investigated entrance pathway of anthropogenic organic chemicals into the environment additional quantitative data incorporating all compartments of the water cycle is required to ultimately assess the sources fate and distribution of the chemicals identified herein and should be complemented by toxicity data once the wide spread occurrence of these chemicals is confirmed however the data generated is sufficient to identify dpg 2 pyrrolidone and tp 216 as priority substances for further investigation while dpg has been consequently included into recent screening and monitoring approaches schulze et al submitted which further confirmed its wide spread presence in the aquatic environment the lack of a commercially available analytical standard still hampers the quantification

19099,transformation of industrial chemicals might be a significant source of hitherto unknown persistent and mobile organic contaminants pmoc pm chemicals present in the aquatic environment herein we depicted a three step strategy consisting of i the prioritization of potential pmoc precursors among reach registered chemicals ii their lab scale transformation through hydrolysis photolysis mno2 oxidation and biotransformation and subsequent structural elucidation of derived transformation products and finally iii the assessment of their environmental relevance the proposed procedure was utilized to investigate eleven chemicals for nine of which a concentration reduction was observed for six of these chemicals transformation products were at least tentatively identified and partially confirmed with a commercially available reference standard retrospective assessment of high performance liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry data as well as a target screening method for the identified tps and some of the prioritized reach chemicals revealed the widespread presence of the following chemicals in the environment 2 pyrrolidone hydrolysis product of vinylpyrrolidone tp 216 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 acetic acid biotransformation product of 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 ethanol and 1 3 diphenylguanidine prioritized chemical with experimental evidence of environmental stability 2 pyrrolidone was detected in 23 25 investigated surface water samples and present in concentrations of up to 400 ng l tp 216 was detected in 20 25 surface water samples and an additional sampling of a waste water treatment plant and the receiving surface water confirmed that tp 216 is formed in waste water treatment plants the vulcanisation agent 1 3 diphenylguanidine was present in all investigated samples a leaching experiment with a tire suggested that tires and thus tire wear particles are a potential source of 1 3 diphenylguanidine with these data the depicted approach was proven successful and suitable for true unknowns like tp 216 and thus an alternative to non target screenings or suspect screenings with predicted tps to identify environmentally relevant transformation products graphical abstract image 1 keywords persistent and mobile organic chemicals pmoc pm chemicals biotransformation hydrolysis photolysis mno2 oxidation prioritization of reach chemicals semi quantitative target screening surface water 1 introduction tens of thousands of anthropogenic chemicals of which the majority is neither regulated nor regularly monitored or even still unknown are expected to be present in the aquatic environment daughton 2004 schwarzenbach et al 2006 the most polar and persistent of these chemicals herein referred to as persistent and mobile organic compounds pmoc reemtsma et al 2016 and alternatively known as persistent and mobile and potentially toxic substances pm t substances neumann 2017 are able to penetrate natural and artificial barriers spread quickly in the aquatic environment and might reach drinking water while the overall contamination of water with anthropogenic chemicals decreases from waste water treatment plant wwtp effluent to finished drinking water the relevance of polar chemicals increases along the water cycle sjerps et al 2016 despite the increasing scientific dulio et al 2018 schmidt 2018 and regulatory neumann 2017 interest in very polar water contaminants many of them are still expected to be unknown and thus a knowledge gap reemtsma et al 2016 exists for these micropollutants natural and artificial transformation processes commonly result in transformation products tps with increasing polarity until either mineralization is achieved or dead end transformation products are formed and thus many tps are expected among the yet unknown pmoc in recent years considerable effort has been put into narrowing the knowledge gap for pmoc through suspect bieber et al 2017 deeb et al 2017 gago ferrero et al 2018 gago ferrero et al 2015 montes et al 2017 and non target gago ferrero et al 2015 ruff et al 2015 schluesener et al 2015 zahn et al 2016 screening approaches which led to the successful identification of numerous novel water contaminants predicted tps have been included in suspect screenings bletsou 2015 but this approach suffers from the inherent uncertainty in tp prediction which may lead to the omission of tps and the combinatorial explosion which results in a rapid growth of the number of predicted tps when their formation in increasingly complex environmental systems is predicted and thus in a high potential for false positives true unknowns which are not present in databases are thus problematic to include in suspect screenings and are exceedingly difficult to identify hollender et al 2017 once detected in non target screenings unknown tps belong to the group of true unknowns and are consequently rarely identified in non target screening approaches in fact tps often only come into the analytical focus and find their way onto suspect lists and chemical databases after their precursor attracted sufficient attention from the scientific community and was thus investigated in detail this leads to a discrepancy between the relatively low number of identified novel tps through suspect and non target screenings and their supposedly high contribution to the total pmoc load in raw and drinking waters that is insufficiently addressed by most commonly deployed analytical approaches in an effort to reduce this gap in knowledge we utilized a three step approach to identify novel polar transformation products consisting of i a prioritization of potential pmoc precursors among reach registered chemicals based on their mobility persistency and emission data that was performed by arp et al 2017 and schulze et al 2018 followed by manual selection from the resulting shortlist ii the identification of tps of these precursors derived by hydrolysis photolysis mno2 oxidation and biotransformation and finally iii the assessment of their environmental relevance with retrospective hrms data evaluation and qualitative semi quantitative analytical data generated from 25 hessian surface water samples in recent years several studies successfully utilized databases for analyte prioritization and subsequent suspect gago ferrero et al 2018 montes et al 2017 or target screenings mclachlan et al 2014 schulze et al submitted however to the best of our knowledge this is the first time such a prioritization approach is deployed to specifically investigate potential precursors of environmentally relevant tps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials 3 aminomethyl 3 5 5

the identification of tps formed during hydrolysis photolysis mno2 oxidation or biotransformation and the assessment of the environmental occurrence of identified tps was deployed to identify environmentally relevant polar transformation products of reach registered chemicals the individual steps are detailed in the following chapters 3 1 prioritization analyte selection is the first crucial step in the identification of transformation derived mobile and persistent water contaminants and requires accurate predictions about the physico chemical properties of chemicals most notably polarity and persistency against all kinds of environmental transformation processes and is thus inherently complex as a first selection step we utilized the work of arp et al 2017 which aimed to identify pmoc and potential precursors thereof among reach registered chemicals and schulze et al 2018 which later on refined that list by the introduction of emission scores and thus allowed an incorporation of the likelihood of environmental emissions based on production volumes and use data for a detailed description of these first prioritization steps please refer to the respective publications after removal of well studied chemicals from the resulting short list of presumed pmoc precursors the final selection took esi amenability and standard availability into account eleven of the remaining chemicals were selected for transformation experiments table 1 3 2 transformation and identification the environmental stability of the selected chemicals was simulated in lab scale hydrolysis photolysis mno2 oxidation and biotransformation experiments table 1 investigated transformation processes were selected to cover the most relevant transformation processes from the emission of a chemical into the aquatic environment mostly through waste water treatment plants to its occurrence in raw waters used for drinking water production thus hydrolysis all compartments of the water cycle photolysis mostly surface waters mno2 oxidation simulation of oxidation on mineral surfaces during infiltration and biotransformation most compartments of the water cycle but most notably waste water treatment plants were deemed relevant purely artificial transformation processes like ozonation were out of scope of this research for two chemicals bga and eht no concentration reduction was observed during the experiments and thus they were stable under the test conditions while a reduction in concentration was observed for the other nine chemicals transformation products were only identified for six of them vp pea doss mtsc htmpe and dpg potential explanations for a concentration reduction of the precursors without the emergence of transformation products are mineralization sorption of either the precursor substance or the formed tp and the formation of transformation products not amenable to esi ms neither tps that are readily adsorbed nor tps not amenable to esi ms are of interest in the context of this research and thus amch hmta and thei are not further discussed herein all detected tps are discussed in detail in the following sections 3 2 1 hydrolysis derived tps n vinylpyrrolidone vp the monomer of the widely deployed polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone and otherwise used in washing and cleaning products echa a underwent hydrolysis under neutral ph 7 t1 2 1 5 days and acidic ph 4 t1 2 5 days conditions resulting in the formation of tp 86 esi m z 86 0600 fig 2 the identification strategy utilized for most tps is visualized on the example of tp 86 in fig s1 and discussed hereinafter hrms data exact mass δ 0 8 ppm and 13c isotopic pattern suggested an elemental composition of c4h8no identification level 4 during ms hrms experiments a cleavage of nh3 and h2o was observed the knowledge that tp 86 is derived from vp the ms hrms data and an h d exchange experiment that proved the presence of one exchangeable hydrogen atom in the neutral structure led to the conclusion that tp 86 is formed by hydrolysis between the vinyl moiety and the nitrogen atom resulting in 2 pyrrolidone id level 2 which was later confirmed with an authentic reference material fig 2 table s8 id level 1 2 pyrrolidone is intentionally produced and used in inks and toners surface treatment products paper production washing and cleaning products as chemical precursor to vinylpyrrolidone and other industrial chemicals and as high boiling point organic solvent echa b however its potential formation by hydrolysis of n vinylpyrrolidone may enable new entry pathways into the environment for this compound dioctyl sulfosuccinate doss which is used as ingredient of coatings filters washing and cleaning products paints adhesives and sealants echa c only underwent hydrolysis at alkaline ph ph 9 t1 2 4 75 days and appears to be otherwise hydrolytically stable for extended periods of time the resulting tp 309 esi m z 309 1014 was assigned an elemental composition of c12h21o7s based on its exact mass δ 0 3 ppm and the isotopic fine structure of 13c 18o and 34s ms hrms data experimental evidence and the presence of one exchangeable hydrogen atom led to the proposed structures for tp 309 fig s2 table s9 id level 2 which are formed by hydrolysis of either of the ester groups a differentiation between both positional isomers derived by hydrolysis at one of both ester groups was not possible with the data at hand and thus both or either of them might be formed during hydrolysis of doss tp 309 has been identified by batchu et al batchu et al 2014 when they studied the behaviour of doss in marine systems in the context of the deep water horizon incident where doss was deployed as main ingredient of a chemical dispersant however data about tp 309 in freshwater systems is to the best of our knowledge not available 4 methylthiosemicarbazide mtsc an educt in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other chemicals echa d was hydrolytically stable under acidic conditions but underwent hydrolysis in neutral ph 7 t1 2 8 25 days and alkaline solution ph 9 t1 2 1 day a transformation product tp 92 with an m z of 92 0164 was detected with hilic esi hrms after hydrolysis fig 2 isotopologues for 13c 33s and 34s indicated the presence of approximately two c and one s and in combination with the exact mass of tp 92 δ 0 2 ppm indicated an elemental composition of c2h6ons this elemental composition and the precursor structure are consistent with hydrolysis at the hydrazine moiety under formation of a hydroxy group at the carbon atom of the thiocarboxyl group an assumption that is further sustained by cleavage of water and a hydroxyl radical two indicators for the presence of a hydroxyl moiety upon fragmentation of tp 92 the proposed structure was further confirmed with h d exchange experiments that demonstrated the presence of two exchangeable hydrogen atoms in the neutral structure which is in compliance with the structure proposal fig 2 fig s3 table s10 id level 2 however under acidic conditions only one exchangeable hydrogen atom was observed which may be explained by the calculated pka of 4 04 chemicalize https chemicalize com of the hydroxyl group consequently limiting its h d exchange under acidic conditions tp 92 underwent further hydrolysis within the test duration and reached its peak concentration after 4 days and 1 day at ph 7 and ph 9 respectively no hydrolysis product of tp 92 was detected and thus it may have undergone mineralization or fell outside of the mass range of the deployed orbitrap with a lower m z limit of 50 due to its fast hydrolysis especially under alkaline conditions tp 92 was not considered as potential pmoc and thus omitted during further investigations 3 2 2 photolysis derived tps among the tested chemicals the formation of transformation products after simulated solar irradiation was only observed for dpg and pea vp doss and mtsc were also degraded but at slow rates compared to hydrolysis which was thus assumed to be the dominant degradation pathway in the aquatic environment dpg is mainly used as a primary accelerator in the vulcanisation of rubber during which it is incorporated in the rubber compound fishbein 1991 dpg was not degraded for 7 days at ph 4 at the experimental conditions fig 3 slow photolysis occurred at ph 7 k 0 0415 d 1 with t1 2 16 5 d the rate constant was one order of magnitude higher at ph 9 k 0 475 d 1 with t1 2 1 5 d which is in agreement with a stronger light absorption of neutral dpg pka 10 12 at ph 9 for wavelengths 300 nm see uv visible absorption spectra in fig s4 a transformation product tp 210 was detected with an m z of 210 1029 by lc hrms after 3 days of irradiation at ph 7 and after 5 days at ph 9 the exact mass of tp 210 is in compliance to the ion formula c13h12n3 theoretical m z 210 1026 δ 1 6 ppm the loss of two hydrogen atoms compared to the parent compound suggests that tp 210 may be formed by intramolecular photocyclization of dpg but no structure could be derived from ms hrms data table s11 fig 3 id level 4 based on our results dpg is not expected to be photodegraded in the aquatic environment under neutral and acidic conditions and the detection of tp 210 is unlikely since it was only detected at trace levels max area 2 relative to the initial area of dpg the expected low extent of photodegradation of dpg in combination with its stability against hydrolysis and biotransformation and its similarity to di o tolylguanidine a novel pmoc recently identified by montes et al 2017 suggest that dpg itself might be a pmoc and thus warrants further investigation pea is used in adhesives and sealants coating products paints ad polymers echa e pea was transformed in presence of oxygen t½ 7 days for 9 mg o2 l at ph 7 fig 3 no transformation was observed in absence of oxygen or in presence of 50 mm furfuryl alcohol used as a scavenger of singlet oxygen 1o2 these results indicate that pea was transformed by reaction with 1o2 produced by an energy transfer between triplet state pea and molecular oxygen a reaction product tp 160 with m z 160 1080 was detected by hilic hrms after 2 days max 4 relative to the initial area of pea after 7 days the ionic sum formula c6h14n3o2 m z 160 1080 δ 0 3 ppm was assigned to tp 160 and a molecular structure was proposed from ms hrms fragmentation data losses of h2o and co indicated the presence of both hydroxyl and carbonyl groups according to the photooxygenation of n heterocyclic compounds iesce et al 2005 the formation of tp 160 could be explained by singlet oxygenation of pea via cycloaddition producing an unstable peroxide which further decomposed by cleavage of the oo bond oxygenation probably occurred on the two adjacent carbon atoms although this could not be confirmed by ms hrms data id level 3 fig s5 table s12 like pea fluoroquinolones have a piperazine ring and showed similar self sensitized photooxidation with amine side chain degradative oxidation iesce et al 2005 li and hu 2018 niu et al 2016 the weak signal of tp 160 max 4 of precursor area at t0 compared to the transformation yield of pea suggests either a weak esi response or that other reactions like chain cleavage occurred but these tps were not detected under our analytical conditions like for fluoroquinolones photodegradation of pea can be an important process but its rate of reaction in the aquatic environment will strongly depend on the concentration and chemical composition of dissolved organic matter acting as photosensitizer and light filter niu et al 2016 porras et al 2016 sturini et al 2012 3 2 3 mno2 oxidation derived tps although several compounds were removed during batch experiments with mno2 tps were only detected for pea pea was completely transformed after 15 min empty bed residence time in an mno2 column and three tps were detected tp 126 tp 142 and tp 160 fig 4 tp 160 had the same retention time and ms hrms fragmentation as the one detected during photolysis of pea the exact masses of tp 126 m z 126 1025 and tp 142 m z 142 0973 point to the ion formula c6h12n3 m z 126 1026 δ 0 6 ppm fig s6 table s13 and c6h12n3o m z 142 097 δ 1 3 ppm fig s7 table s14 respectively tentative elucidation of molecular structures was done with ms hrms data and proposed structures are given in fig 4 id level 3 compared to pea tp 126 lost four hydrogen atoms and showed only one fragment with m z 71 0600 suggesting that the primary amino group was converted to an imino group thus tp 126 would be formed by oxidative dehydrogenation of the primary amine and piperazine ring tp 126 further underwent hydroxylation of the piperazine ring and additional oxidation to a carbonyl compound leading to the formation of tp 142 the oxidation of the imino group to an amide was not observed compared to tp 126 and tp 142 the loss of nh3 in the ms hrms data of tp 160 indicated that the primary amine was preserved diamino compounds like pea are susceptible to transformation by mno2 with cleavage of the central cc bond resulting in n formyl compounds curragh et al 1960 henbest and thomas 1957 similar to photolysis such tps of pea are likely to be formed in the presence of mno2 but they were not detected in our study similar reactions of hydroxylation and cleavage of the cc bond of the piperazine ring were also proposed for the oxidation of fluoroquinolones by mno2 zhang and huang 2005 3 2 4 biotransformation derived tps 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 ethanol htmpe which is used in the manufacturing of chemicals and plastic products echa f was the only investigated analyte that underwent significant primary biotransformation under the experimental conditions htmpe was transformed quickly t1 2 1 2 days into tp 216 esi m z 216 1595 that was assigned the elemental composition of c11h22o3n based on its exact mass δ 0 3 ppm and 13c and 18o isotopic pattern which suggested an oxidation of htmpe during ms hrms analysis the presence of a c2h6o2n fragment indicated an oxidation close to the nitrogen atom and h d exchange experiments were consistent with two exchangeable hydrogen atoms in the neutral structure which was strong evidence against the formation of a third hydroxyl moiety and simultaneous formation of a double bond thus an oxidation of the ethanol moiety to a carboxylic acid was deemed the most probable fig 5 fig s8 table s15 id level 3 tp 216 was stable in the inoculum for at least 4 weeks indicating persistency against hydrolysis and further biotransformation since no additional tps were observed and the combined relative area of htmpe and tp 216 remained constant throughout the experiment between 0 9 and 1 05 see figure s9 it was assumed that tp 216 is the main if not only biotransformation product of htmpe the low maximum intensity of tp 216 which was only 20 of its precursor was attributed to a reduced esi response to the best of our knowledge tp 216 has to this point not been reported as transformation product of htmpe or as environmental contaminant 3 3 confirmation of environmental occurrence all in all nine tps were detected during lab scale transformation experiments however due to the inherent complexity of natural systems and the uncertain environmental presence of the precursors the detection in laboratory experiments does not necessarily imply the presence of these tps in the environment once a tp has been successfully identified it can be retrospectively searched for in existing hrms data or be included in suspect or target screening campaigns to assess its environmental occurrence 3 3 1 retrospective evaluation of hrms data the identified tps were retrospectively screened for in hrms data generated during a previous non target screening campaign zahn et al 2016 screening criteria were the exact mass and isotopologues dpg bga 2 pyrrolidone tp 86 tp 309 tp 126 tp 142 tp 160 and tp 216 were screened for tp 216 was potentially detected in two samples but could not be confirmed since no ms hrms data was recorded for this compound dpg 53 of samples and 2 pyrrolidone 100 of samples were the most frequently detected analytes a retrospective assessment of the prioritization and identification process during the initial non target screening revealed that 2 pyrrolidone was excluded early on during the data processing since it did not meet the requirement of an at least tenfold blankintensity that is frequently imposed on non target screening data this demonstrates that high blanks can be a significant issue in non target screenings and may lead to the exclusion of widely present analytes 3 3 2 semi quantitative target screening to more accurately and sensitively assess the presence of the nine tps bga and dpg in the aquatic environment a hilic uhplc smrm method was developed analytes were tuned from isolated hplc fractions or if available from standard solutions the sample preparation method involving the evaporation of the aqueous matrix in a vacuum centrifuge at 50 c and 9 mbar was adopted from köke et al 2018 this method was utilized to semi quantify the analytes in 25 hessian surface waters fig 6 apparent recoveries of each analyte were approximated by the mean apparent recovery of three spiked surface water samples and blank concentrations were assessed with ten independent blank replicates the developed method was suitable for dpg bga 2 pyrrolidone tp 309 tp 142 tp 160 and tp 216 these elevated temperatures accelerated hydrolysis rates which was only relevant for 2 pyrrolidone for which consequently not necessarily current concentrations but rather the formation potential in the water samples was assessed method validation was not performed nor were commercial standards available for many of the analytes and thus only semi quantitative information can be generated with this method consequently given concentrations represent approximations rather than exact values neither tp of pea tp 142 and tp 160 nor tp 309 were detected in any of the surface water samples which might be related to the high blank signals of tp 309 or the sample selection in case of pea tps that are assumed to form during the subsurface passage tp 216 fig 6a was detected in 80 of the surface water samples in estimated equivalent concentrations estimated against calibration of precursor of up to 90 ng l these concentrations however are likely underestimations given the approximately fivefold lower esi response of tp 216 compared to its precursor that was evident from the biotransformation experiment if complete conversion of htmpe to tp 216 is assumed surface water 13 in which the highest tp 216 concentrations were observed was sampled again to determine the source of tp 216 grab samples were taken at two different time points after the source of the river and before and after a connected wwtp 24 h composite samples of the influent and effluent of the wwtp were taken in parallel to the surface water samples this second sampling campaign revealed that the concentrations of tp 216 in surface water 13 were significantly lower than during the first sampling which might indicate seasonal variations that tp 216 is formed in the wwtp and that wwtps can act as point source for tp 216 semi quantification of 2 pyrrolidone was aggravated by a significant blank that was also observed during the retrospective analysis of hrms data and thus consequently leads to comparatively high limits of detection and quantification nevertheless 2 pyrrolidone was detected in all but two surface water samples 92 and blank corrected concentrations of several hundreds of ng l 2 pyrrolidone was detected as odorous compound in wwtps in the mg l range agus et al 2011 but to the best of our knowledge so far not described in aquatic environment 2 pyrrolidone might be directly discharged or formed by hydrolysis of n vinylpyrrolidone it is not known to be persistent echa b however the widespread occurrence in high concentrations may warrant further investigation dpg was detected in every investigated surface water sample and was predominantly present in the double digit ng l range which is in compliance to its widespread detection during the retrospective analysis of hrms data and even exceeds it likely due to the increased sensitivity of the target screening approach dpg has previously been detected in chinese drinking water where migration from high density polyethylene pipes was identified as its source tang et al 2015 but has not gained much attention as environmental contaminant thus far this widespread detection of dpg during the target screening and retrospective analysis of hrms data raises the question of its source since dpg is mainly used as vulcanisation agent in rubber products and especially tires and tire wear particles was found to be one of the main sources of microplastic particles in the environment with an estimated global emission of approximately 6 106 t a kole et al 2017 a contamination of the aquatic environment with dpg through leaching from tire wear particles was hypothesized dpg leaching was confirmed when a new tire was immersed in deionized water the dpg concentration in the water increased steadily and reached its maximum of approximately 140 μg l after 1 week figure s10 thus identifying tires and tire wear particles as potential source of dpg in the aquatic environment in fact the vastly increased surface area of tire wear particles compared to an intact tire might increase the leaching rate considerably and depending on the presence of a local sewage system tire wear particles or chemicals leached from it might reach the aquatic environment untreated wagner et al 2018 4 conclusions of 11 prioritized chemicals nine were degraded during the transformation experiments tps were at least tentatively identified and two of these tps along with one prioritized chemical were found to be widespread in the aquatic environment this demonstrates the potential of this approach to identify environmentally relevant tps the prioritization process and the transformation procedures investigated can be modified to tailor this approach to the question at hand given the uncertainty of persistency mobility and emission prediction of reach chemicals in the absence of reliable experimental data and the inherent complexity of environmental transformation processes confirmation of the environmental occurrence is essential the results for 2 pyrrolidone for which the high blank signal would lead to an automatic exclusion in many non target screening procedures and tp 216 which as a true unknown would be inherently difficult to identify without knowledge of its precursor structure demonstrate the complementarity of the analytical approach depicted herein with suspect and non target screenings while the laborious experimental work severely limits the number of chemicals that can be processed in comparison to suspect and non target screenings it was demonstrated that a sophisticated prioritization and experimental workflow may lead to the identification of environmentally relevant tps that slip through other screening approaches and thus enable the identification of otherwise elusive novel tps leaching from tires and consequently tire wear particles was identified as a potential source of the wide spread environmental contaminant dpg further experiments and monitoring are required to assess the relevance of this entrance pathway given the large quantity of tire wear particles estimated global amount 6 106 t a and the complex composition of tires leachables from tire wear particles might be a significant yet scarcely investigated entrance pathway of anthropogenic organic chemicals into the environment additional quantitative data incorporating all compartments of the water cycle is required to ultimately assess the sources fate and distribution of the chemicals identified herein and should be complemented by toxicity data once the wide spread occurrence of these chemicals is confirmed however the data generated is sufficient to identify dpg 2 pyrrolidone and tp 216 as priority substances for further investigation while dpg has been consequently included into recent screening and monitoring approaches schulze et al submitted which further confirmed its wide spread presence in the aquatic environment the lack of a commercially available analytical standard still hampers the quantification
