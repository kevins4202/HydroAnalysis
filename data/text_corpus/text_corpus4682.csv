exists in a design by rule dbr however in dba methods the designer should conduct a finite element analysis fea and evaluate the results iteratively to meet the design criteria in this paper we propose a new approach to estimating the minimum vapor pressure of a prismatic pressure vessel that follows the design philosophy of an imo type c independent tank the procedure of the proposed method

pressure 1 introduction the research and development of liquefied natural gas lng propulsion ships have been ongoing as a promising response to the sox emission regulations that will go into effect in 2020 wan et al 2015 schinas and butler 2016 lng fuel is the most reasonable solution and can satisfy the current and upcoming regulations for the principal types of emissions nox sox co2 among the fuel types considered lng has the advantages of a low price klein 2011 however there are some critical impacts of using lng fuel in a ship design because conventional oil fuel is stored under atmospheric conditions it can be easily stored in hull structural tanks however when using lng fuel there are several aspects that require special consideration first the density of lng 0 45 ton m3 is more than twice lower than that of heavy fuel oil hfo 0 98 ton m3 considering the heat values of two fuels lng 49 mj kg hfo 40 6 mj kg the required volume of an lng fuel storage tank becomes 1 8 times that of an hfo fuel storage tank to obtain the same engine output secondly lng is a liquified gas that operates at cryogenic temperature it requires insulation and most of the tanks that store liquified gas are cylindrical pressure vessels comprehensively the capacity of the lng storage tank should be 3 to 4 times larger than that of an oil tank in order to obtain the same engine output van rynbach 2014 thus it is clear that the critical issue for an lng fuel storage tank is to maximize the volume efficiency considering the volume efficiency issue conventional membrane type tank or imo type b tank have been the best option since those can be constructed as prismatic shape however since the both tanks are non pressure vessel the design vapor pressure is limited not to exceed 0 7 barg by rule imo 2016a b even though a reasonable insulation system is designed heat leakage in the tank causes lng to continuously evaporate as bog choi et al 2016 the pressure build up due to the bog must be handled by a strengthened thermal insulation or a bog re liquefaction system to ensure that the generated vapor pressure should not exceed the 0 7 barg during the voyage even though the membrane tank has been widely used for the lng carriers still lots of research and developments are going on regarding the thermal insulation system niu et al 2017 choi et al 2016 and the bog re liquefaction system yoo 2017 tan et al 2016 meaning that still it has some challenges to overcome on the contrary imo type c tanks which are conventional cylindrical pressure vessel are designed to withstand the pressure build up due to the bog imo 2016a b this means that imo type c tanks have high flexibility in the bog handling and that capex and opex can be saved accordingly natural gas global 2017 however main weakness of these pressure tanks was the low volume efficiency lee et al 2017 the newly developed pressure vessel can overcome this weakness chang and bergan 2012 developed a prismatic pressure vessel based on a new concept a so called lattice pressure vessel where the internal structure acts as a pressure loading part to withstand the high internal pressure ahn et al 2017 proposed a prismatic pressure vessel for a gas fueled ship in their research it was proved that a prismatic pressure vessel can be applied to cryogenic pressure vessels installed on a ship many different studies on the development of a prismatic pressure vessel have been conducted however currently there are no clear standards for estimating the minimum design vapor pressure of a prismatic pressure vessel in the initial design stage from the thermodynamic point of view the minimum design vapor pressure can be interpreted as the lowest pressure build up due to the bog generated by the heat leakage of the lng cargo loaded at normal pressure in the lng storage tank during the voyage the generated vapor pressure is the dependent on the thermodynamic characteristics of the designed tank including heat ingress rate due to the surface area of the tank insulation performance etc choi et al 2015 proposed a method that simultaneously considers the vapor pressure and the liquid pressure in dynamic condition for prismatic lng storage vessel that research estimated reasonable design pressure considering dynamic force by ship motion and actual state of the lng however the limitation of it is that the storage vessel that were used for case study was not a pressure vessel and also it didn t consider fatigue crack propagation that must be considered for type c independent tank to prevent cargo leakage at the life cycle operation pressure vessels on a ship must satisfy the fatigue crack criteria during a ship s voyage for the existing cylinder type pressure vessel type c independent tank used on a ship a formula is used to determine the minimum vapor pressure based on the imo design regulations imo 2016a the current formulae are established based on a cylinder type structure which is mostly affected by membrane stress it is necessary to modify the structure when applied to a prismatic pressure vessel which is mostly affected by the bending stress the minimum design vapor pressure of the conventional pressure vessel is determined according to the dbr method based on experimental data that represent the amount of possible fatigue crack propagation under the most severe conditions that can occur during the 20 year lifetime of ship kime et al 1977 it is possible to apply all possible conditions without calculating the dynamic load or fatigue crack propagation rate for each individual case this enables an effective reduction in the overall design time however because the formula is based on the most severe loading condition when applied to each individual case it is difficult to know how much margin it contains if the estimated value is significantly higher than the original criteria the structure can be over designed and therefore it is disadvantageous from an economical perspective the engineering authorities guide the design codes imo 2016b for novel concepts such as a prismatic pressure vessel a dba can be applied using a numerical analysis typically a finite element analysis and the results can be evaluated against the design criteria unlike a dbr with this type of methodology the load required for each case is directly calculated and thus a design can be created more economically and efficiently however a separate calculation of each load should be considered in addition it is difficult to reflect the correlation between the design variables and the various loads required and thus the design should be conducted through trial and error which leads to an increase in the overall design time see table 1 if the minimum design vapor pressure of a prismatic pressure vessel can be determined based on the fatigue fracture criterion such as in the conventional pressure vessel of a ship determined using a dbr method it will not be necessary to reassess the pressure several times during the design process in addition for the current dbr method the minimum design vapor pressure is solely determined from the viewpoint of the fatigue crack propagation irrelevant to the actual increased pressure due to the bog or operating condition if the actual vapor pressure which can be pressure build up during the operation condition or operating pressure is higher than the estimated minimum vapor pressure by rule than the estimated actual vapor pressure is used for calculating the design vapor pressure however if the actual vapor pressure is lower than the estimated minimum vapor pressure by rule the minimum vapor pressure by rule is used for calculating the design vapor pressure fig 1 this kind of a standard is also requisite for the novel concept prismatic pressure vessel since there are no clear standards for estimating the minimum design vapor pressure of a prismatic pressure vessel in the initial design stage the final design should also include pressure build up due to bog buckling and sloshing in addition to these fatigue crack propagation criteria however the existing type c rule only considers fatigue crack propagation criteria and liquid pressure when estimating the minimum wall thickness senjanović et al 2006 buckling or sloshing criteria are satisfied by considering additional buckling rings or swash bulkheads similarly in this paper the scope is limited to calculating the minimum vapor pressure of the novel concept pressure vessel based on the design criteria of fatigue crack propagation in this paper we propose a combined methodology using dba and dbr methods that can achieve both design efficiency and convenience in estimating the minimum design pressure for a novel prismatic pressure vessel in compliance with the imo pressure vessel design philosophy for verification the results of the proposed method are compared with those determined through an fea 2 background in this section in order to describe the general procedure of the proposed method three things are priory discussed first in section 2 1 2 3 the general procedure for estimating the design pressure of a pressure vessel used on a ship in compliance with the imo pressure vessel design philosophy is described the design pressure consists of the sum of the maximum liquid pressure and the design vapor pressure the design vapor pressure determined using the dbr method was reviewed to examine both its advantages and disadvantages secondly in section 2 4 the general characteristics of prismatic pressure vessels and the simplified formula for estimating the maximum stress are described lastly in section 2 5 modified fatigue crack propagation model considering bending stress are described 2 1 design pressure the method and philosophy for estimating the design pressure of a pressure vessel vary based on the purpose and operating conditions of the pressure vessel pressure vessels used mostly on land are primarily designed by considering the static loading and consider wind effects and earthquakes as the most severe conditions however pressure vessels used on ships consider dynamic forces by ship motion owing to waves encountered during the voyage according to the imo design regulations imo 2016a pressure vessels used on ships are classified as independent type c the method for estimating the design pressure of independent type c is described in the imo design regulations by classifying the design pressure as the sum of the maximum liquid pressure and minimum vapor pressure the design philosophy of independent type c is to prevent any leak from occurring during a lifecycle operation the actual vapor pressure is determined based on the thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases at the given temperature in a closed system however the design rules for estimating the minimum vapor pressure for an independent type c pressure vessel are designed by considering the minimum design vapor pressure to ensure that the dynamic stress is sufficiently low such that an initial surface flaw will not propagate through the thickness of the shell or cause leakage during the lifetime of the tank imo 2016a this rule is constructed based on the design principle of a conventional pressure vessel that is mostly affected by membrane stress in a cylindrical pressure vessel the internal pressure for determination of the tank scantlings is expressed as 1 p i p 0 p g d max b a r where p i is the design pressure p o is the design vapor pressure and p g d max is the maximum liquid pressure 2 2 liquid pressure in a pressure vessel liquid pressure occurs through the combined effect of acceleration and gravity acting at the center of gravity of the cargo owing to the ship motion the liquid surface in the pressure vessel varies with the heeling angle β as shown in fig 2 conventionally the liquid pressure is measured at the three points shown in fig 2 the largest liquid height z β among these three points where the pressure is to be considered is measured from the shell of the pressure vessel in the β direction as shown in the figure the liquid surface can be formed outside the pressure vessel under fully loaded conditions the acceleration of the liquid occurs through the combined effect of dynamic and gravitational loads in the direction perpendicular to the liquid surface choi et al 2015 in fig 3 a x a y and a z are the maximum dimensionless accelerations in the longitudinal transverse and vertical directions respectively these accelerations act on the center of gravity of the tank the values of a x a y and a z are determined based on the ship particulars and coordinates of the target point choi et al 2015 the detailed formulae for estimating the acceleration components are illustrated in the imo design regulations imo 2016a the pressure of the cargo tank is to be determined based on the full load conditions corresponding to the scantling draft for a scantling evaluation dnv 2011 it is usually considered sufficient to estimate the accelerations individually for the design purpose of the shell and ends of the tank therefore the resultant acceleration in an arbitrary direction is estimated along the perimeter line as shown in fig 3 in which the acceleration includes both dynamic and static components in the figure the vertical component with a magnitude of 1 0 indicates the acceleration of gravity based on the unit g therefore the intersection of a straight line and the acceleration ellipse with angle β or α for the resultant acceleration in general the maximum value of the liquid pressure p g d is determined according to eq 2 for the y z and x z planes the liquid pressure at the tank surface is derived from the imo design regulations imo 2016a for the detail derivation of maximum z β and a β please refer choi et al 2015 2 p g d ρ z β a β 1 02 10 4 bar 2 3 vapor pressure according to kime et al 1977 the design rules for estimating the minimum design vapor pressure of a pressure vessel installed on a ship were created based on fracture mechanics and the crack propagation theory the main idea in developing this rule was to determine the maximum allowable dynamic stress at which an assumed crack will not grow beyond a certain limit which is half the thickness of the tank shell the maximum dynamic allowable stress is empirically determined based on the following assumptions and procedures 1 crack growth is assumed to follow paris law 3 d a d n c 1 1 δ σ q π a m where a is the crack depth q is a constant that depends on the ratio between the crack axes c and m are material constants and n is the number of cycles 2 the material of interest is 9 ni and c m and the mean stress values are shown in table 2 3 a crack is considered to be non propagating under the following condition 4 δ k 1 3 m p a m 1 2 4 the dynamic stress spectrum follows the long term distribution of 108 cycles which is equivalent to a lifetime of 20 years the long term wave induced stress range spectrum 108 cycles is given in table 3 dnv 2011 108 cycles are divided into 30 blocks where δ σ is normalized stress range and n is number of cycles in each block 5 the initial flaw depth is assumed to be a 0 2 t where t is a shell thickness of no greater than 6 mm and the initial flaw axis is assumed to be a sharp elliptical surface crack with a depth to length ratio of a c 0 2 constant during crack propagation the experiment results show that the allowable dynamic stress is 110 mpa for 9 ni steel and divided by a safety factor of two 2 which resulted in 55 mpa according to kime et al 1977 regarding the design vapor pressure rule the minimum design vapor pressure is derived using the following relationship 5 σ max δ σ p max δ p p o p g d δ p to derive p o from eq 5 δ p and p g d are estimated under several assumptions based on three basic tank orientations when considering the vertical axis which shows that the tank height has the largest dimension and with the center of gravity located far from amidships the vertical acceleration becomes the principal factor governing the pressure fluctuation at the bottom of the tank using the assumptions by kime et al 1977 δ p and p g d are derived as follows 6 δ p 0 2 1 22 h 9 ρ h 7 p g d 0 1 ρ h then p o can be calculated as 8 p o δ p σ max δ σ p g d 0 2 1 22 h 9 ρ h σ max δ σ 0 1 ρ h where ρ is the relative density of the cargo σ max is the design membrane stress which is 230 mpa for 9 ni and the δ σ is allowable dynamic membrane stress which is 55 mpa for 9 ni a straight line approximation for p o is made using the above equations 9 p 0 0 2 a h ρ r 1 5 m p a where a 0 00185 σ t o t a l δ σ 2 with σ t o t a l is design primary membrane stress δ σ is allowable dynamic membrane stress double amplitude at probability level q 10 8 c is a characteristic tank dimension to be taken as the greatest of the following h 0 75 b 0 45 l with h is height of tank in ship s vertical direction m b is width of tank in ship s transverse direction m l is length of tank in ship s longitudinal direction m and ρ r is the relative density of the cargo 1 0 for fresh water at the design temperature comparing a straight line and curve fitted using eq 8 we can see that the straight line matches well when the tank height is larger than approximately 15 m see fig 4 a similar assumption is used for other tank orientations and the overall equation is derived as eq 9 we can see that the formula for estimating the design vapor pressure is empirically determined under several assumptions eventually if the tank dimensions are relatively small the vapor pressure based on the rule is much larger than the calculated value in addition considering that the allowable dynamic membrane stress already has a safety factor of two 2 this method has a sufficient margin and the tank will be conservatively designed thus if we follow the conventional rules it has a disadvantage from an economical point of view however with this method the crack propagation rate does not need to be evaluated in a case by case manner and the efficiency of the design procedure can be pursued 2 4 structural characteristics of prismatic pressure vessel and simplified maximum stress calculation method a conventional pressure vessel which is a cylindrical pressure vessel is affected by the membrane stress owing to its structural characteristics on the contrary if the structure consists mainly of a plane surface the bending stress should be significantly considered thus the basic principle in the design of a prismatic pressure vessel is to decrease the bending stress that occurs using reinforcing plates with stiffeners to satisfy the design criteria see fig 5 to design a prismatic pressure vessel with a large size the tank must be stiffened using internal structures with an adequate span and shape if we consider a tank shell stiffened with reinforcing members with a uniform span the tank shell will consist of many unit cells and it can be assumed that each unit cell has a clamped boundary condition lee and cho 2017 see fig 6 according to plate theory timoshenko and woinowsky 1959 the maximum bending moments occur at the middle of the longest edge of a clamped plate consider a rectangular plate with edge lengths a and b where a is longer than b if uniform load p is distributed onto the plate with a clamped boundary condition the maximum bending stress will occur at the middle edge of a the empirically designed formula for the maximum bending stress is expressed as carvill 1993 follows 10 σ b e n d i n g p b 2 2 t 2 0 623 b a 6 1 normally the membrane stress acting on the unit cell cannot be depicted using only the unit cell dimension because it is affected by the tank dimensions if we assume that the membrane stress is proportional to the bending stress with a certain ratio r the total stress can be described as 11 σ t o t a l σ b e n d i n g σ m e m b r a n e 1 r p b 2 2 t 2 0 623 b a 6 1 as the occurring stress should not exceed the strength criteria s the required minimum thickness can be depicted as 12 t 1 r p b 2 2 s 0 623 b a 6 1 2 5 modified fatigue crack propagation model considering bending stress the first step is to develop an appropriate fatigue crack propagation model for a prismatic pressure vessel because a prismatic pressure vessel is subjected to bending and membrane stresses an empirical equation for the stress intensity factors at a surface crack in a finite plate subjected to tension and bending loads newman and raju 1981 is used to estimate the allowable dynamic stress of the prismatic pressure vessel see fig 7 13 δ k δ σ m h δ σ b π a q f a t c t c w ϕ where δ σ m is dynamic membrane stress δ σ b is dynamic bending stress a is crack depth c is half length of crack t is thickness of plate w is width of plate and q f a t c t c w ϕ can be described as q 1 1

proposed method the basic idea of the proposed methodology is to consider the thickness variance and required maximum dynamic stress that satisfy the fatigue crack propagation criteria a combination of dbr method and dba method is applied in this method where the minimum shell thickness and the minimum design vapor pressure are considered simultaneously to satisfy both the internal pressure strength and fatigue crack propagation criteria the assumptions of this method are as follows 1 the minimum thickness of the shell is only dependent on the internal pressure 2 basic assumptions for the crack propagation model follow those of a conventional imo pressure vessel model 3 the stresses occurring on a prismatic pressure vessel can be divided into bending and membrane stresses 4 membrane stress cannot be specified exactly because it depends on the shape or arrangement of the internal members thus it is described as the ratio of bending stress 0 1 0 3 5 the tank shell is stiffened by internal members and is formulated using repeated unit cells the bending stress occurring at the unit cell is estimated by assuming clamped edge boundary conditions the overall design procedures are described in fig 8 3 2 case study to demonstrate the procedure used in the proposed method a case study was conducted using a prismatic lng tank made of 9 ni steel the case study was conducted through the following procedures 1 determine the tank dimensions and the target ship the size of the prismatic tank is 12 m 12 m 36 m b h l see fig 9 2 determine the tank material and strength criteria according to the list of cargo that will be carried a stress analysis should be conducted regarding the acceptance criteria for imo type c independent tanks the allowable stresses shall not exceed the criteria listed in table 4 for 9 ni steel the detailed procedure for the calculation of the values in table 5 is based on the imo design regulations for an independent type c tank imo 2016a 3 estimate the maximum liquid pressure p h and the pressure variance δp according to the imo rule the ship is a cargo carrier assume that the tank is arranged in the transverse direction fig 10 and the general ship information appropriate for this tank size and the parameters for calculating the acceleration and pressure variances are as shown in table 5 we can derive the accelerations table 6 acting on the tank under deep draught conditions by following the imo design regulation imo 2016a which will be used for estimating the maximum liquid pressure and the pressure variance from table 6 we can see that relatively large accelerations occur in the transverse and vertical directions applying the procedure illustrated in section 2 2 with these two accelerations we can derive the maximum and minimum liquid pressures pressure variance at the tank can be represented as shown in fig 11 we can then calculate the pressure variance at the tank by 14 δ p ρ 1 02 10 4 a β 1 z β 1 a β 2 z β 2 b a r the maximum and minimum liquid pressures should be calculated individually to find the variance in maximum pressure fig 12 shows the liquid pressure variance according to the heeling angle table 7 shows the results of the pressure variation we can see that pressure variation in this case study is 1 44 bar and that the maximum liquid pressure is 1 76 bar 4 set the design pressure as p p p o p h and calculate the shell thickness t using the formulae suggested for prismatic pressure vessels let us set the unit cell dimensions of the rectangular plate to 3000 mm 750 mm see fig 13 because we already have the maximum liquid pressure and the allowable stress criteria we can derive an equation for the thickness from eq 15 15 t 1 r 0 176 p o 750 2 2 345 0 623 750 3000 6 1 m m 5 use the pressure variance δp and the suggested formula proposed in step 4 to estimate the fatigue crack propagation length δu when 20 year ship s life cyclic loads are applied at this stage trial and error methods are implemented to find the appropriate vapor pressure that satisfies the fatigue crack propagation criteria in the case study r 0 1 and p o 4 bar are used based on a maximum liquid pressure of 1 76 bar the design pressure obtained is 5 76 bar and the required thickness of the shell is 22 8 mm based on the proposed thickness formula the initial surface crack depth can then be assumed as 4 46 mm 6 calculate the design pressure p using the relation in which the fatigue crack propagation length δu should be half of the shell thickness t that satisfies the design philosophy of an imo independent type c tank next the final crack depth during the 20 year cyclic loading is calculated following the previous crack propagation model the estimated final crack depth is 5 12 mm because the criterion for the final crack depth of this model is 11 4 mm which is half the thickness of the shell the crack propagation has not reached this criterion thus the next step is to decrease the input vapor pressure and repeat the procedure repeating this procedure using trial and error it will be possible to find the vapor pressure in which the final crack depth is equal to half of the shell thickness a diagram for finding the vapor pressure is shown below see fig 14 7 the minimum design pressure can be estimated because the design pressure p is the sum of the design vapor pressure p o and maximum liquid pressure p h the estimated crack propagation rate in the case study is shown in table 8 4 verification and result 4 1 verification through fem for a validation of the case study commercial fem software abaqus was used shell elements s8r5 which are 8 node doubly curved thin shell reduced integration using five degrees of freedom per node were applied for a static analysis a convergence test was conducted to determine the mesh size as compared with the analytical results of the unit cell clamped conditions under a uniform applied load the test conditions are described in table 9 and fig 15 shows the results of the convergence test here s mises mpa indicates the von mises stress because a mesh size of 150 mm showed an error of less than 5 3 5 compared to the analytical results a mesh size of 150 mm was applied to the structural analysis fig 16 shows the mesh distribution and loading conditions during the analysis figs 17 20 illustrate the results of the fem analysis at the design pressure and pressure variance here s11 mean x direction normal stress mpa which becomes the principal stress of the structure in addition ssavg indicates the membrane stress mpa a comparison of the results between the proposed method and the fem is shown in table 10 as shown in the table the results of the fem and those of the proposed method match well which means that proposed method for calculating the maximum stress is quite reasonable 4 2 result by applying the proposed method it is possible to estimate both the design vapor pressure and the required minimum shell thickness without an fem analysis which is convenient for a tank design in addition the proposed method directly calculates the required minimum shell thickness that can satisfy the fatigue crack propagation criteria and thus it can minimize the margin and a tank can be efficiently designed for a better understanding let us consider applying a conventional rule for comparison because a tank is placed in the transverse direction of the ship the characteristic tank dimensions are 0 75 36 m 27 m following the conventional rule applying this value to the conventional rules the minimum design vapor pressure for the case study tank is yielded as 5 1 bar because the maximum liquid pressure for the case study tank is 1 8 bar summing these two values the design pressure for the case study tank becomes 6 9 bar applying this design pressure to the suggested stress evaluation equation the required minimum thickness should be 24 8 mm starting with the initial crack depth of 4 96 mm which is equal to 1 5 of the shell thickness the estimated final crack depth is 5 27 mm this satisfies the fatigue crack propagation criteria but shows a margin containing inherent conservativeness however applying the proposed method the required thickness can be reduced to 15 8 mm while satisfying the fatigue crack propagation criteria in addition the tank shell weight can be reduced up to 35 which means that the tank can be designed more efficiently with the proposed method a comparison of the results between the conventional rule and the proposed method is shown in table 11 5 conclusion in this paper the methodologies required to estimate the minimum vapor pressure of a prismatic pressure vessel primarily constructed using plane surfaces and following the design philosophy of an imo type c independent tank were proposed the structural characteristics of the prismatic pressure vessel were described and a simplified maximum stress calculation method considering the bending stress was suggested by employing the unit cell concept a modified fatigue crack propagation model considering the bending stress was applied to a prismatic pressure vessel the procedure of the proposed method was demonstrated from a case study using a 9 ni tank with a size of 12 m 12 m 36 m an fem analysis was conducted for verification purposes and a comparison showed that the results of the proposed method and the fem matched well by applying the proposed method it was possible to estimate the required minimum thickness and the required minimum design vapor pressure without an iterative fem analysis in addition minimization of the required tank shell thickness was possible because the proposed method enables directly calculating the crack propagation rate and consequently avoiding an unnecessary margin by satisfying the fatigue crack propagation criteria in this study only the bending stress at the plate parts was considered to estimate the minimum design vapor pressure of the prismatic which can be treated as a tertiary bending stress for the future study analysis of structure behavior of the prismatic pressure vessel that also considers the primary and secondary stress of

heat leakage of the lng cargo loaded at normal pressure in the lng storage tank during the voyage the generated vapor pressure is the dependent on the thermodynamic characteristics of the designed tank including heat ingress rate due to the surface area of the tank insulation performance etc choi et al 2015 proposed a method that simultaneously considers the vapor pressure and the liquid pressure in dynamic condition for prismatic lng storage vessel that research estimated reasonable design pressure considering dynamic force by ship motion and actual state of the lng however the limitation of it is that the storage vessel that were used for case study was not a pressure vessel and also it didn t consider fatigue crack propagation that must be considered for type c independent tank to prevent cargo leakage at the life cycle operation pressure vessels on a ship must satisfy the fatigue crack criteria during a ship s voyage for the existing cylinder type pressure vessel type c independent tank used on a ship a formula is used to determine the minimum vapor pressure based on the imo design regulations imo 2016a the current formulae are established based on a cylinder type structure which is mostly affected by membrane stress it is necessary to modify the structure when applied to a prismatic pressure vessel which is mostly affected by the bending stress the minimum design vapor pressure of the conventional pressure vessel is determined according to the dbr method based on experimental data that represent the amount of possible fatigue crack propagation under the most severe conditions that can occur during the 20 year lifetime of ship kime et al 1977 it is possible to apply all possible conditions without calculating the dynamic load or fatigue crack propagation rate for each individual case this enables an effective reduction in the overall design time however because the formula is based on the most severe loading condition when applied to each individual case it is difficult to know how much margin it contains if the estimated value is significantly higher than the original criteria the structure can be over designed and therefore it is disadvantageous from an economical perspective the engineering authorities guide the design codes imo 2016b for novel concepts such as a prismatic pressure vessel a dba can be applied using a numerical analysis typically a finite element analysis and the results can be evaluated against the design criteria unlike a dbr with this type of methodology the load required for each case is directly calculated and thus a design can be created more economically and efficiently however a separate calculation of each load should be considered in addition it is difficult to reflect the correlation between the design variables and the various loads required and thus the design should be conducted through trial and error which leads to an increase in the overall design time see table 1 if the minimum design vapor pressure of a prismatic pressure vessel can be determined based on the fatigue fracture criterion such as in the conventional pressure vessel of a ship determined using a dbr method it will not be necessary to reassess the pressure several times during the design process in addition for the current dbr method the minimum design vapor pressure is solely determined from the viewpoint of the fatigue crack propagation irrelevant to the actual increased pressure due to the bog or operating condition if the actual vapor pressure which can be pressure build up during the operation condition or operating pressure is higher than the estimated minimum vapor pressure by rule than the estimated actual vapor pressure is used for calculating the design vapor pressure however if the actual vapor pressure is lower than the estimated minimum vapor pressure by rule the minimum vapor pressure by rule is used for calculating the design vapor pressure fig 1 this kind of a standard is also requisite for the novel concept prismatic pressure vessel since there are no clear standards for estimating the minimum design vapor pressure of a prismatic pressure vessel in the initial design stage the final design should also include pressure build up due to bog buckling and sloshing in addition to these fatigue crack propagation criteria however the existing type c rule only considers fatigue crack propagation criteria and liquid pressure when estimating the minimum wall thickness senjanović et al 2006 buckling or sloshing criteria are satisfied by considering additional buckling rings or swash bulkheads similarly in this paper the scope is limited to calculating the minimum vapor pressure of the novel concept pressure vessel based on the design criteria of fatigue crack propagation in this paper we propose a combined methodology using dba and dbr methods that can achieve both design efficiency and convenience in estimating the minimum design pressure for a novel prismatic pressure vessel in compliance with the imo pressure vessel design philosophy for verification the results of the proposed method are compared with those determined through an fea 2 background in this section in order to describe the general procedure of the proposed method three things are priory discussed first in section 2 1 2 3 the general procedure for estimating the design pressure of a pressure vessel used on a ship in compliance with the imo pressure vessel design philosophy is described the design pressure consists of the sum of the maximum liquid pressure and the design vapor pressure the design vapor pressure determined using the dbr method was reviewed to examine both its advantages and disadvantages secondly in section 2 4 the general characteristics of prismatic pressure vessels and the simplified formula for estimating the maximum stress are described lastly in section 2 5 modified fatigue crack propagation model considering bending stress are described 2 1 design pressure the method and philosophy for estimating the design pressure of a pressure vessel vary based on the purpose and operating conditions of the pressure vessel pressure vessels used mostly on land are primarily designed by considering the static loading and consider wind effects and earthquakes as the most severe conditions however pressure vessels used on ships consider dynamic forces by ship motion owing to waves encountered during the voyage according to the imo design regulations imo 2016a pressure vessels used on ships are classified as independent type c the method for estimating the design pressure of independent type c is described in the imo design regulations by classifying the design pressure as the sum of the maximum liquid pressure and minimum vapor pressure the design philosophy of independent type c is to prevent any leak from occurring during a lifecycle operation the actual vapor pressure is determined based on the thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases at the given temperature in a closed system however the design rules for estimating the minimum vapor pressure for an independent type c pressure vessel are designed by considering the minimum design vapor pressure to ensure that the dynamic stress is sufficiently low such that an initial surface flaw will not propagate through the thickness of the shell or cause leakage during the lifetime of the tank imo 2016a this rule is constructed based on the design principle of a conventional pressure vessel that is mostly affected by membrane stress in a cylindrical pressure vessel the internal pressure for determination of the tank scantlings is expressed as 1 p i p 0 p g d max b a r where p i is the design pressure p o is the design vapor pressure and p g d max is the maximum liquid pressure 2 2 liquid pressure in a pressure vessel liquid pressure occurs through the combined effect of acceleration and gravity acting at the center of gravity of the cargo owing to the ship motion the liquid surface in the pressure vessel varies with the heeling angle β as shown in fig 2 conventionally the liquid pressure is measured at the three points shown in fig 2 the largest liquid height z β among these three points where the pressure is to be considered is measured from the shell of the pressure vessel in the β direction as shown in the figure the liquid surface can be formed outside the pressure vessel under fully loaded conditions the acceleration of the liquid occurs through the combined effect of dynamic and gravitational loads in the direction perpendicular to the liquid surface choi et al 2015 in fig 3 a x a y and a z are the maximum dimensionless accelerations in the longitudinal transverse and vertical directions respectively these accelerations act on the center of gravity of the tank the values of a x a y and a z are determined based on the ship particulars and coordinates of the target point choi et al 2015 the detailed formulae for estimating the acceleration components are illustrated in the imo design regulations imo 2016a the pressure of the cargo tank is to be determined based on the full load conditions corresponding to the scantling draft for a scantling evaluation dnv 2011 it is usually considered sufficient to estimate the accelerations individually for the design purpose of the shell and ends of the tank therefore the resultant acceleration in an arbitrary direction is estimated along the perimeter line as shown in fig 3 in which the acceleration includes both dynamic and static components in the figure the vertical component with a magnitude of 1 0 indicates the acceleration of gravity based on the unit g therefore the intersection of a straight line and the acceleration ellipse with angle β or α for the resultant acceleration in general the maximum value of the liquid pressure p g d is determined according to eq 2 for the y z and x z planes the liquid pressure at the tank surface is derived from the imo design regulations imo 2016a for the detail derivation of maximum z β and a β please refer choi et al 2015 2 p g d ρ z β a β 1 02 10 4 bar 2 3 vapor pressure according to kime et al 1977 the design rules for estimating the minimum design vapor pressure of a pressure vessel installed on a ship were created based on fracture mechanics and the crack propagation theory the main idea in developing this rule was to determine the maximum allowable dynamic stress at which an assumed crack will not grow beyond a certain limit which is half the thickness of the tank shell the maximum dynamic allowable stress is empirically determined based on the following assumptions and procedures 1 crack growth is assumed to follow paris law 3 d a d n c 1 1 δ σ q π a m where a is the crack depth q is a constant that depends on the ratio between the crack axes c and m are material constants and n is the number of cycles 2 the material of interest is 9 ni and c m and the mean stress values are shown in table 2 3 a crack is considered to be non propagating under the following condition 4 δ k 1 3 m p a m 1 2 4 the dynamic stress spectrum follows the long term distribution of 108 cycles which is equivalent to a lifetime of 20 years the long term wave induced stress range spectrum 108 cycles is given in table 3 dnv 2011 108 cycles are divided into 30 blocks where δ σ is normalized stress range and n is number of cycles in each block 5 the initial flaw depth is assumed to be a 0 2 t where t is a shell thickness of no greater than 6 mm and the initial flaw axis is assumed to be a sharp elliptical surface crack with a depth to length ratio of a c 0 2 constant during crack propagation the experiment results show that the allowable dynamic stress is 110 mpa for 9 ni steel and divided by a safety factor of two 2 which resulted in 55 mpa according to kime et al 1977 regarding the design vapor pressure rule the minimum design vapor pressure is derived using the following relationship 5 σ max δ σ p max δ p p o p g d δ p to derive p o from eq 5 δ p and p g d are estimated under several assumptions based on three basic tank orientations when considering the vertical axis which shows that the tank height has the largest dimension and with the center of gravity located far from amidships the vertical acceleration becomes the principal factor governing the pressure fluctuation at the bottom of the tank using the assumptions by kime et al 1977 δ p and p g d are derived as follows 6 δ p 0 2 1 22 h 9 ρ h 7 p g d 0 1 ρ h then p o can be calculated as 8 p o δ p σ max δ σ p g d 0 2 1 22 h 9 ρ h σ max δ σ 0 1 ρ h where ρ is the relative density of the cargo σ max is the design membrane stress which is 230 mpa for 9 ni and the δ σ is allowable dynamic membrane stress which is 55 mpa for 9 ni a straight line approximation for p o is made using the above equations 9 p 0 0 2 a h ρ r 1 5 m p a where a 0 00185 σ t o t a l δ σ 2 with σ t o t a l is design primary membrane stress δ σ is allowable dynamic membrane stress double amplitude at probability level q 10 8 c is a characteristic tank dimension to be taken as the greatest of the following h 0 75 b 0 45 l with h is height of tank in ship s vertical direction m b is width of tank in ship s transverse direction m l is length of tank in ship s longitudinal direction m and ρ r is the relative density of the cargo 1 0 for fresh water at the design temperature comparing a straight line and curve fitted using eq 8 we can see that the straight line matches well when the tank height is larger than approximately 15 m see fig 4 a similar assumption is used for other tank orientations and the overall equation is derived as eq 9 we can see that the formula for estimating the design vapor pressure is empirically determined under several assumptions eventually if the tank dimensions are relatively small the vapor pressure based on the rule is much larger than the calculated value in addition considering that the allowable dynamic membrane stress already has a safety factor of two 2 this method has a sufficient margin and the tank will be conservatively designed thus if we follow the conventional rules it has a disadvantage from an economical point of view however with this method the crack propagation rate does not need to be evaluated in a case by case manner and the efficiency of the design procedure can be pursued 2 4 structural characteristics of prismatic pressure vessel and simplified maximum stress calculation method a conventional pressure vessel which is a cylindrical pressure vessel is affected by the membrane stress owing to its structural characteristics on the contrary if the structure consists mainly of a plane surface the bending stress should be significantly considered thus the basic principle in the design of a prismatic pressure vessel is to decrease the bending stress that occurs using reinforcing plates with stiffeners to satisfy the design criteria see fig 5 to design a prismatic pressure vessel with a large size the tank must be stiffened using internal structures with an adequate span and shape if we consider a tank shell stiffened with reinforcing members with a uniform span the tank shell will consist of many unit cells and it can be assumed that each unit cell has a clamped boundary condition lee and cho 2017 see fig 6 according to plate theory timoshenko and woinowsky 1959 the maximum bending moments occur at the middle of the longest edge of a clamped plate consider a rectangular plate with edge lengths a and b where a is longer than b if uniform load p is distributed onto the plate with a clamped boundary condition the maximum bending stress will occur at the middle edge of a the empirically designed formula for the maximum bending stress is expressed as carvill 1993 follows 10 σ b e n d i n g p b 2 2 t 2 0 623 b a 6 1 normally the membrane stress acting on the unit cell cannot be depicted using only the unit cell dimension because it is affected by the tank dimensions if we assume that the membrane stress is proportional to the bending stress with a certain ratio r the total stress can be described as 11 σ t o t a l σ b e n d i n g σ m e m b r a n e 1 r p b 2 2 t 2 0 623 b a 6 1 as the occurring stress should not exceed the strength criteria s the required minimum thickness can be depicted as 12 t 1 r p b 2 2 s 0 623 b a 6 1 2 5 modified fatigue crack propagation model considering bending stress the first step is to develop an appropriate fatigue crack propagation model for a prismatic pressure vessel because a prismatic pressure vessel is subjected to bending and membrane stresses an empirical equation for the stress intensity factors at a surface crack in a finite plate subjected to tension and bending loads newman and raju 1981 is used to estimate the allowable dynamic stress of the prismatic pressure vessel see fig 7 13 δ k δ σ m h δ σ b π a q f a t c t c w ϕ where δ σ m is dynamic membrane stress δ σ b is dynamic bending stress a is crack depth c is half length of crack t is thickness of plate w is width of plate and q f a t c t c w ϕ can be described as q 1 1

proposed method the basic idea of the proposed methodology is to consider the thickness variance and required maximum dynamic stress that satisfy the fatigue crack propagation criteria a combination of dbr method and dba method is applied in this method where the minimum shell thickness and the minimum design vapor pressure are considered simultaneously to satisfy both the internal pressure strength and fatigue crack propagation criteria the assumptions of this method are as follows 1 the minimum thickness of the shell is only dependent on the internal pressure 2 basic assumptions for the crack propagation model follow those of a conventional imo pressure vessel model 3 the stresses occurring on a prismatic pressure vessel can be divided into bending and membrane stresses 4 membrane stress cannot be specified exactly because it depends on the shape or arrangement of the internal members thus it is described as the ratio of bending stress 0 1 0 3 5 the tank shell is stiffened by internal members and is formulated using repeated unit cells the bending stress occurring at the unit cell is estimated by assuming clamped edge boundary conditions the overall design procedures are described in fig 8 3 2 case study to demonstrate the procedure used in the proposed method a case study was conducted using a prismatic lng tank made of 9 ni steel the case study was conducted through the following procedures 1 determine the tank dimensions and the target ship the size of the prismatic tank is 12 m 12 m 36 m b h l see fig 9 2 determine the tank material and strength criteria according to the list of cargo that will be carried a stress analysis should be conducted regarding the acceptance criteria for imo type c independent tanks the allowable stresses shall not exceed the criteria listed in table 4 for 9 ni steel the detailed procedure for the calculation of the values in table 5 is based on the imo design regulations for an independent type c tank imo 2016a 3 estimate the maximum liquid pressure p h and the pressure variance δp according to the imo rule the ship is a cargo carrier assume that the tank is arranged in the transverse direction fig 10 and the general ship information appropriate for this tank size and the parameters for calculating the acceleration and pressure variances are as shown in table 5 we can derive the accelerations table 6 acting on the tank under deep draught conditions by following the imo design regulation imo 2016a which will be used for estimating the maximum liquid pressure and the pressure variance from table 6 we can see that relatively large accelerations occur in the transverse and vertical directions applying the procedure illustrated in section 2 2 with these two accelerations we can derive the maximum and minimum liquid pressures pressure variance at the tank can be represented as shown in fig 11 we can then calculate the pressure variance at the tank by 14 δ p ρ 1 02 10 4 a β 1 z β 1 a β 2 z β 2 b a r the maximum and minimum liquid pressures should be calculated individually to find the variance in maximum pressure fig 12 shows the liquid pressure variance according to the heeling angle table 7 shows the results of the pressure variation we can see that pressure variation in this case study is 1 44 bar and that the maximum liquid pressure is 1 76 bar 4 set the design pressure as p p p o p h and calculate the shell thickness t using the formulae suggested for prismatic pressure vessels let us set the unit cell dimensions of the rectangular plate to 3000 mm 750 mm see fig 13 because we already have the maximum liquid pressure and the allowable stress criteria we can derive an equation for the thickness from eq 15 15 t 1 r 0 176 p o 750 2 2 345 0 623 750 3000 6 1 m m 5 use the pressure variance δp and the suggested formula proposed in step 4 to estimate the fatigue crack propagation length δu when 20 year ship s life cyclic loads are applied at this stage trial and error methods are implemented to find the appropriate vapor pressure that satisfies the fatigue crack propagation criteria in the case study r 0 1 and p o 4 bar are used based on a maximum liquid pressure of 1 76 bar the design pressure obtained is 5 76 bar and the required thickness of the shell is 22 8 mm based on the proposed thickness formula the initial surface crack depth can then be assumed as 4 46 mm 6 calculate the design pressure p using the relation in which the fatigue crack propagation length δu should be half of the shell thickness t that satisfies the design philosophy of an imo independent type c tank next the final crack depth during the 20 year cyclic loading is calculated following the previous crack propagation model the estimated final crack depth is 5 12 mm because the criterion for the final crack depth of this model is 11 4 mm which is half the thickness of the shell the crack propagation has not reached this criterion thus the next step is to decrease the input vapor pressure and repeat the procedure repeating this procedure using trial and error it will be possible to find the vapor pressure in which the final crack depth is equal to half of the shell thickness a diagram for finding the vapor pressure is shown below see fig 14 7 the minimum design pressure can be estimated because the design pressure p is the sum of the design vapor pressure p o and maximum liquid pressure p h the estimated crack propagation rate in the case study is shown in table 8 4 verification and result 4 1 verification through fem for a validation of the case study commercial fem software abaqus was used shell elements s8r5 which are 8 node doubly curved thin shell reduced integration using five degrees of freedom per node were applied for a static analysis a convergence test was conducted to determine the mesh size as compared with the analytical results of the unit cell clamped conditions under a uniform applied load the test conditions are described in table 9 and fig 15 shows the results of the convergence test here s mises mpa indicates the von mises stress because a mesh size of 150 mm showed an error of less than 5 3 5 compared to the analytical results a mesh size of 150 mm was applied to the structural analysis fig 16 shows the mesh distribution and loading conditions during the analysis figs 17 20 illustrate the results of the fem analysis at the design pressure and pressure variance here s11 mean x direction normal stress mpa which becomes the principal stress of the structure in addition ssavg indicates the membrane stress mpa a comparison of the results between the proposed method and the fem is shown in table 10 as shown in the table the results of the fem and those of the proposed method match well which means that proposed method for calculating the maximum stress is quite reasonable 4 2 result by applying the proposed method it is possible to estimate both the design vapor pressure and the required minimum shell thickness without an fem analysis which is convenient for a tank design in addition the proposed method directly calculates the required minimum shell thickness that can satisfy the fatigue crack propagation criteria and thus it can minimize the margin and a tank can be efficiently designed for a better understanding let us consider applying a conventional rule for comparison because a tank is placed in the transverse direction of the ship the characteristic tank dimensions are 0 75 36 m 27 m following the conventional rule applying this value to the conventional rules the minimum design vapor pressure for the case study tank is yielded as 5 1 bar because the maximum liquid pressure for the case study tank is 1 8 bar summing these two values the design pressure for the case study tank becomes 6 9 bar applying this design pressure to the suggested stress evaluation equation the required minimum thickness should be 24 8 mm starting with the initial crack depth of 4 96 mm which is equal to 1 5 of the shell thickness the estimated final crack depth is 5 27 mm this satisfies the fatigue crack propagation criteria but shows a margin containing inherent conservativeness however applying the proposed method the required thickness can be reduced to 15 8 mm while satisfying the fatigue crack propagation criteria in addition the tank shell weight can be reduced up to 35 which means that the tank can be designed more efficiently with the proposed method a comparison of the results between the conventional rule and the proposed method is shown in table 11 5 conclusion in this paper the methodologies required to estimate the minimum vapor pressure of a prismatic pressure vessel primarily constructed using plane surfaces and following the design philosophy of an imo type c independent tank were proposed the structural characteristics of the prismatic pressure vessel were described and a simplified maximum stress calculation method considering the bending stress was suggested by employing the unit cell concept a modified fatigue crack propagation model considering the bending stress was applied to a prismatic pressure vessel the procedure of the proposed method was demonstrated from a case study using a 9 ni tank with a size of 12 m 12 m 36 m an fem analysis was conducted for verification purposes and a comparison showed that the results of the proposed method and the fem matched well by applying the proposed method it was possible to estimate the required minimum thickness and the required minimum design vapor pressure without an iterative fem analysis in addition minimization of the required tank shell thickness was possible because the proposed method enables directly calculating the crack propagation rate and consequently avoiding an unnecessary margin by satisfying the fatigue crack propagation criteria in this study only the bending stress at the plate parts was considered to estimate the minimum design vapor pressure of the prismatic which can be treated as a tertiary bending stress for the future study analysis of structure behavior of the prismatic pressure vessel that also considers the primary and secondary stress of

23411,based on a database of sea state parameters in the adriatic sea wave statistics has been developed at three different geographic locations along the busy adriatic shipping route the underlying database consists of a systematic numerical hindcast calibrated by 24 year satellite measurements and represents the most comprehensive data source of wave parameters available for the region joint probability distributions of significant wave heights and peak spectral periods are derived thus enabling extreme sea states to be determined furthermore waves have been evaluated with respect to the well known dominant wind patterns in the adriatic and compared to the tabain s spectrum a single parametric spectral description developed for local conditions and widely used in engineering practice statistics for three geographical locations are compared with one another as well as with data from other available references these long term statistics and regression equations developed can be used not only for fatigue and extreme wave loads of ships offshore installations and renewable energy devices intended for the adriatic sea but also for planning and carrying out various marine operations in that specific environment at the end of the study some consideration is given to the effects of climate changes on the variability of sea states in the adriatic keywords wave statistics satellite and numerical database adriatic sea 1 introduction the adriatic sea is a semi enclosed body of water connected to the mediterranean sea through the otranto strait at its southeast located between parallel mountain ranges of the apennines west and the dinarides east it experiences a specific wind wave climate with strong winds of limited fetch considering its enclosed nature a rich commercial activity poses a significant associated risk to its fragile ecological system therefore a better understanding of the wave climate in the adriatic is required to support sustainable and ecologically friendly shipbuilding maritime offshore mariculture renewable energy nautical tourism and related industries wave climate is important also for planning and decision making in the event of a marine accident parunov et al 2017 up to date statistical analyses of waves in the adriatic sea have been mostly based on gathered visual observations and occasional buoy measurements specifically for seagoing vessels an adopted approach for seakeeping response analysis is based on wave energy spectrum description ochi 1978 for the adriatic sea naval architects use a formulation given by tabain 1997 which is a one parameter wave spectrum dependent only on significant wave height hs the tabain s spectrum is derived by modification of the well known jonswap spectrum although of great importance to the maritime sector in the adriatic region the tabain s spectrum is derived mostly from observations and a limited number of measurements and therefore needs to be compared with recently acquired data the northern part of the adriatic sea the gulf of venice has relatively shallow waters and mild bottom slopes while its southern part reaches maximum water depths of up to 1200 m dominant wind events that cause surface waves in the adriatic are bura n ne to e ne italian bora jugo e se to ss e sirocco family and maestral w nw to nw bura and jugo reach storm conditions and can cause extreme wave occurrences while maestral is of milder character and important for recreational sailing due to its predictive nature especially during summer months katalinić et al 2015 a maximum wave height of 10 8 m was recorded as the highest maximum wave in the adriatic during an event of jugo wind while theoretical predictions of the most probable extreme significant wave heights for 20 and 100 year return periods read 7 20 and 8 57 m respectively leder et al 1998 bura n ne to e ne is the strongest wind by its intensity blowing over the dinaric mountains which shape its focus points across the adriatic by nature it blows in gales of more than 20 m s 72 km h and the fastest recorded wind impact of bura is 68 m s 245 km h in the mid adriatic coast line where the velebit mountain forms a funnel the main limitation for the development of bura wind waves is its relatively short fetch jugo blows along the adriatic e se to ss e and usually develops for several days until reaching its maximum speed waves already formed enter through the otranto strait s southern boundary and develop further along the adriatic reaching a more developed sea state and longer waves than those of bura which are inherently steeper and shorter in storm conditions jugo can reach speeds up to 30 m s over 100 km h katalinić et al 2015 nowadays there are two relevant wave atlases available and applicable for the adriatic medatlas cavaleri 2005 and worldwaves atlas barstow et al 2003 both databases are obtained by hindcasting using numerical wave modelling calibrated against satellite and wave buoy measurements this study is based on data from the worldwave atlas gathered during the last two decades up to recent dates statistical analysis of wave parameters is done for three representative geographical locations chosen in the northern central and southern adriatic sea located along the main longitudinal shipping route the main aim of this study is to develop long term statistics enabling prediction of extreme seas states at representative locations of three adriatic regions based on the acquired 24 year systematic database obtained by a satellite measurement calibration of a numerical hindcast wave model barstow et al 2003 for each location joint probability distribution of significant wave heights and peak spectral periods is established marginal distribution of wave heights enables to extrapolate existing data to long time periods and determine long term extreme significant wave heights conditional distribution of wave periods enables predicting wave periods of such extreme sea states extreme significant wave heights are compared with previously published results that are mostly obtained based on incomplete wave datasets knowledge of the simultaneous occurrence of wind speeds and significant wave heights is used to establish a functional relationship between wind speed and significant wave heights using regression analysis as the swell in the adriatic is rather low such relationship enables quick and reliable prediction of significant wave heights solely from wind data database enables also to establish a relationship between significant wave height and spectral peak periods in order to check adequacy of the single parametric tabain s wave spectrum commonly used in seakeeping studies in the adriatic the long term sea states are usually defined under the assumption that sea states have the same statistical distribution i e the climate conditions are stationary however statistical approaches based on the assumption of stationarity would lead to invalid conclusions in the case of climate change although the present 24 year database is clearly rather short to analyse climate variability vanem 2015 it has nevertheless been used to get some insight into the variation of sea state parameters in the last two and a half decades the paper begins with the literature review in section 1 1 covering systematic studies of waves in the adriatic that started in the mid 20th century after world war ii up to the current date the database used in the present study is described in section 1 2 a joint probability distribution model of significant wave height and spectral peak period is developed in section 2 2 based on det norske veritas recommendations for environmental conditions and loads modelling dnv 2014 in section 2 3 a regression model relating wind speed and significant wave height for two dominant wind patterns jugo and bura is presented a statistical estimate of extreme sea states for various return periods is provided in section 2 4 in section 2 5 the peak spectral frequency to significant wave height relation resulting from the dataset is compared with the commonly used tabain s wave spectrum to determine its suitability changes of average and extreme sea states through the years as a possible consequence of the climate variability are analysed in section 2 6 the paper ends with the corresponding conclusions emphasizing the obtained results and acquired tools and giving the geostrategic context of the adriatic sea 1 1 literature review of sea state statistics in the adriatic sea first research work on wave statistics in the adriatic sea was performed by tabain 1974 he used visual observations and reports from meteorological naval and merchant ships in the adriatic and developed a rather rough wave statistics considering the wind wave specificities of the basin he also developed a sea state scale for the adriatic sea and gave its relation against the wmo scale later on he derived the tabain s wave spectrum which has been commonly used for local purposes until today tabain 1997 senjanović et al 2000 a systematic wave statistics based on long term 1957 1971 visual ship observations has been reported in the climatology atlas published by the hydrographic institute of the republic of croatia 1979 it contains monthly averages of wave height occurrences from basic incoming direction represented in the form of wave roses although basically covering the complete adriatic basin it inherits all drawbacks of visual wave observations from ships systematic underestimation of observed significant wave heights parunov et al 2011 and the lack of data for highest sea states as they are avoided by ships guedes soares 1986 the accuracy of the visual wave observations has been questioned in the literature since the 1990s especially concerning the wave period bitner gregersen et al 2016 parunov et al 2011 used this climatology atlas to develop wave statistics in the adriatic they concluded that sea states with significant wave heights between 0 5 and 1 m are the most frequent in the adriatic sea sea states with significant wave heights larger than 4 m were observed quite rarely while significant wave heights larger than 5 m were almost never encountered by merchant ships more severe sea states up to significant wave heights of 7 m were recorded only by measurements from fixed offshore platforms more recent work includes the application of third generation numerical wave models e g wam swan janekovic and tudor 2005 made preliminary validation of the swan wave model ris et al 1999 for bura wind conditions with wind simulation input acquired from the national meteorological organization and compared the results with wave buoy recordings two operational numerical wave models are available online for real time estimation of sea states in the adriatic the wam model is run by the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf and the wwm ii model is run with an even higher resolution than the ecmwf s model by a privately owned company called gekom www gekom hr wave climate in the adriatic has also been examined for civil engineering purposes by ocvirk 2010 in her phd thesis by application of a commercial numerical wave model mike21 bertotti and cavaleri 2009 analysed the quality of the wind and wave predictions in the adriatic sea considering the corresponding analysis and forecast fields of the ecmwf up to 72 h they used the wam model to forecast wave fields and offered firm evidences that in an enclosed sea the capability of producing successful forecasts beyond a limited time extent is greatly reduced with respect to the oceans furthermore they concluded that the reliability of the forecasts substantially decreases when dealing with meteorological events characterized by strong temporal and spatial gradients as is typical during bura wind this indicates that any wave forecast in the adriatic sea should be taken with great caution satellite altimetry measurements have been reported in depth by queffeulou and bentamy 2007 interesting conclusion from their study is that the adriatic is the mildest sea basin in the mediterranean with an average significant wave height of 0 85 m while 80 of the data are less than 1 10 m research on waves as a renewable energy resource focusing on the adriatic sea was performed by liberti et al 2013 combining both satellite measurement and numerical models referencing also to available buoy in situ measurements ron project along the adriatic s west coast they confirmed that although the adriatic is a low average wave power area the wave power may reach considerable values comparable with those encountered in the more productive regions of the world the 24 year oceanor wave parameter database has been used recently to improve wave statistics in the middle adriatic by farkas et al 2016 as well as by mudronja et al 2017 to examine the possibility of using neural networks for wave height modelling a study on expected wind wave severity changes in the adriatic sea for the period 2070 2099 and their impact on extremes are presented by benetazzo et al 2012 to do so the swan spectral wave model was forced using wind fields computed by a high resolution regional climate model statistical analysis of waves was performed and compared to the results of another 30 year simulation from 1965 to 1994 results showed a future wave climate in the adriatic sea milder than the present climate even though increases of wave severity can occur locally according to that study global warming due to the enhanced greenhouse effect will not affect wind generated waves in the adriatic 1 2 worldwaves atlas worldwaves atlas wwa is a group name for high resolution interactive wind and wave atlases wwa is developed primarily based on satellite measurements validated by in situ measurements by wave buoys and hindcasted by numerical wave modelling bitner gregersen et al 2016 pointed out that such wave hindcast datasets properly validated against in situ and satellite data are nowadays considered as the best data choice for development of design and operation criteria for marine structures wwa includes satellite altimeter data at full resolution from the following satellite missions geosat 1986 1989 topex 1992 2002

is measured each time a satellite passes and wind speed is estimated by a parametric model satellite data is validated based on wave buoy data given that the pass cycle of the satellite is about 10 35 days gathered data do not have a sufficiently high temporal resolution to provide systematic high resolution data satellite measurements are combined with state of the art numerical models i e the numerical model is calibrated by satellite measurements wwa applies a third generation wave model wam for deep sea waves it is run on a daily basis by the ecmwf barstow et al 2003 the acquired database includes 39 uniformly distributed locations across the adriatic sea fig 1 left all of them being calibration points by altimetry measurements collected along satellite tracks fig 1 right the selected and analysed locations are location a 44 5 n 13 5 e northern adriatic sea location b 43 0 n 15 5 e central adriatic sea location c 41 5 n 17 5 e southern adriatic sea at each location twelve physical wave and wind parameters are given plus the date and time at six hour intervals four per day each location has 34 460 data outputs in total starting from september 1992 to the end of january 2016 the available parameters are provided in table 1 while in fig 2 an example of significant wave height timeline is given for a one year period in table 1 mean wave periods are energy periods defined in terms of spectral moments as m 1 m0 2 methodolgy and results in the present study statistical analysis of the oceanor database for the adriatic has been performed due to a large number of measurements to be processed matlab computing software has been used algorithms within the software have been developed to facilitate data processing for different locations in the future in order to provide met ocean data for scientific and engineering work the results of these algorithms are presented in this study 2 1 sea state tables significant wave height hs and spectral peak or zero crossing period tp tz represent the most important sea state parameters for design and operations of ships and offshore structures sea state tables organizing the number of recorded significant wave height swh and spectral peak period pp1d occurrences into classes for a specific location have been generated significant wave height classes are given in meters with 0 5 m increment per class between 0 and 6 5 m peak period classes are defined with 1 s increments between 0 and 14 s from a total of 34 460 data logs for each location in the database there are occasional data missing these lines have been excluded prior to processing and analysing the statistics frequencies of occurrence of different sea states are presented in tables 2 4 for the north central and south adriatic respectively in the last row and column of the table total number of occurrences in the specific class has been also given for significant wave heights and wave spectral peak periods respectively below each table the percentage of occurrences of significant wave heights lower than 1 m and the highest recorded significant wave height with date when it was recorded are also reported percentage of wave occurrence by direction divided in 30 bins and by significant wave height h s is conveniently presented by wave roses wave roses for three studied locations are shown in fig 3 it can be seen from fig 3 that there is a higher frequency of bura ne quadrant wind waves in the north while maestral nw quadrant and jugo se quadrant wind waves prevail in the central and south locations in general the adriatic experiences a fairly mild wave climate 2 2 joint probability distribution of significant wave heights and peak wave periods after obtaining a sea state table for selected locations a joint probability distribution model is fitted aiming to determine parameters of extreme sea states with large return periods being outside the sea state tables and also to enable consistent treatment of loading in a fatigue and strength analysis of ships and offshore structures methods to fit join probability distributions of wind waves current and sea water level are reviewed by bitner gregersen 2012 for joint probabilistic modelling of wind waves and peak spectral periods when complete probabilistic information obtained from simultaneous observations of the environmental variables are available as in the present study the conditional modelling approach cma is recommended bitner gregersen 2012 dnv 2014 in general the joint density function in this method is defined by a marginal distribution and series of conditional density functions each of which is modelled using parametric functions that are fitted to the conditioned data using some form of estimation process 2 2 1 marginal distribution of significant wave heights proposed cma uses the 3 parameter weibull probability density function pdf as a marginal pdf of significant wave height swh or h s equation 1 1 f h s h ˆ s α θ h ˆ s ε θ α 1 exp h ˆ s ε θ α where ε is the location θ the scale and α is the shape parameter all evaluated from the actual data by the least square method lsm the peak period pp1d or t p conditional on swh is modelled by a log normal probability density function given by equation 2 2 f t z h s t p h ˆ s 1 σ l n t p t p 2 π exp ln t p μ l n t p 2 2 σ l n t p 2 where the distribution parameters μ ln t p mean of logarithms of the variable and σ ln t p standard deviation of logarithms of the variable are functions of swh and are evaluated from actual data parunov 2000 the 3 parameter weibull cumulative probability distribution is given as 3 f h s p h ˆ s h s 1 exp h ˆ s ε θ α h s h ˆ s ε p h ˆ s h s represents the probability that the random variable significant wave height h ˆ s takes a lower value than a certain h s the probability of h s being exceeded is then given as 4 q h ˆ s 1 p h ˆ s for each value h s i from tables 2 4 the empirical exceedance probability is given by the commonly used expression parunov 2000 parunov et al 2011 5 q h s i j 1 i f j n 1 where j 1 i f j represents the cumulative frequency of all values larger or equal to h s i while n represents the total number of observations total sum of observations as given in the sea state tables the empirical probability p h ˆ s i that h s i is not exceeded is then given by equation 4 to determine the theoretical weibull fit parameters the expression 3 is logarithmized twice to obtain the linear model in the following form 6 ln ln 1 f h s α ln h s ε α l n θ the distribution can then be seen as a linear relation of ln h s ε and ln ln 1 f h s as presented in fig 4 the linear relation coefficients a slope and b ordinate intersection are determined by the least square method lsm and subsequently the weibull shape α and scale θ parameters are determined according to 7 α a 8 θ e b a the described procedure in eqs 6 8 is performed within an outer optimization loop in which the value of the location parameter ε is calculated by minimizing the sum of the lsm residuum a similar procedure is employed by mansour and preston 1995 fitting results for analysed locations are shown in table 5 2 2 2 conditional probability distribution of the peak wave periods distribution of wave spectral peak periods pp1d for a certain significant wave height class is described by the log normal distribution an example evaluation of fit parameters at selected locations is presented in fig 5 for swh between 0 5 and 1 0 m summarized log normal parameters fit values are presented in table 6 this wave class represents the most frequent swh class with about 38 of occurrence in average for all three locations according to sea state tables log normal distribution parameters given in eq 2 for a given swh and a pp1d class interval of 1 s are evaluated as follows log mean μ l n t p 9 μ l n t p l n μ t p 2 σ t p 2 μ t p 2 log standard deviation σ l n t p 10 σ l n t p ln 1 σ t p 2 μ t p 2 and these variables in turn depend on the mean μ t p 2 and variance σ t p 2 fitting of the theoretical distribution to the measured pp1d data for swh class 0 5 1 0 m is presented in fig 5 for the three locations the mean and the standard deviation of peak spectral wave periods are also given as a function of the swh class range to provide a complete description of sea states the relation between the significant wave height h s at a logarithmic scale and the spectral peak period parameters can reasonably be presented as a linear fit fig 6 in this way the mean μ t p and the standard deviation σ t p can be evaluated as a function of h s 11 μ t p a ln h s b 12 σ t p c ln h s d where coefficients a b c and d are given below in table 7 along with respective coefficients of determination r 2 which are a goodness of fit measure from 0 worst to 1 best it can be noticed that the applied procedure gives the best coefficient of determination for the north adriatic location a a lower coefficient of determination for standard deviation is a consequence of a small number of measurements for high sea states 2 3 relationship of wind speed and wind sea height in the adriatic sea a regression model of wind speed to wave height is defined for the selected locations fig 7 as bura and jugo winds generate waves of different characteristics regression equations are separately developed for each of them more advanced joint probabilistic models for wind speed u w and significant wave height h s are described and recommended in literature bitner gregersen 2012 but a quadratic regression curve is chosen for its simplicity and good fit results this relation allows for a fast significant wave height forecast tool at a specified location based solely on wind speed typically measured 10 m above sea level that can be easily acquired from the national meteorological service a quadratic relation is chosen for the regression equation katalinić et al 2014 relating significant wave height h s and wind speed u w 13 h s e u w 2 f u w parameters e and f of eq 13 for all locations with respective coefficient of determination r 2 are given in table 8 very high values of r 2 may be noticed in table 8 the modelled wind speed to wave height relation is compared to regression relations provided by leder et al 1998 for the north adriatic at location a and to results obtained by cgwindwaves runet 2016 software significant wave height and wave spectrum evaluated by cgwindwaves software are based on bretschenider s relation and they are calculated within the software as a function of fetch water depth and wind speed with directional spectrum effects included by the effective fetch method a comparison of the regression model obtained in the present study with those of leder et al 1998 and the results obtained by cgwindwaves software is presented in fig 8 graphs presented in fig 8 show a different trend for bura and a bias for jugo compared to relations found in literature leder et al 1998 for the north adriatic in general relations developed in the present study show a good consistency with cgwindwave for bura fig 8 left except for the highest wind speeds where bretschneider s relation underestimated the significant wave height 2 4 extreme sea states calculation of long term extreme values of significant wave heights is based on previously defined weibull distribution long term extreme significant wave heights are given depending on the return period rp in years wist 2003 after defining the theoretical distribution function for a random variable h ˆ s probability of exceeding certain h s in a specified return period is given by equation 14 14 q h s r p t r e g n 1 r p where t reg is the duration of uninterrupted observation 23 5 years h ˆ s is a random wave height and n represents the number of samples total sum of observations as given in the sea state tables when a certain probability of exceeding a random variable h ˆ s is determined using the weibull fit the value of a certain wave height being exceeded in a specific return period is calculated by equation 15 15 h s r p θ ln q h s r p 1 α ε where α ε and θ are weibull parameters of the marginal distribution of hs determined in section 2 2 1 the extreme significant wave height calculation results are given in fig 9 along with extremes calculated by leder et al 1998 who applied the maximum likelihood method on the f t i fisher and tippett distribution for a location in the north adriatic that is close to location a the obtained results for location a show good consistency with the curve given by leder et al 1998 which is expected as they apply for the same region extreme values of significant wave height for different return periods are given in table 9 the obtained values for location a can also be compared to maximum in situ measurements by offshore platforms located in the north adriatic the absolute maximum significant wave height was 6 58 m in a 10 year return period during a storm in 1979 with single highest wave record of 10 2 m parunov at al 2011 the single highest wave ever recorded was 10 8 m high in 1986 the calculated extreme value for the north adriatic location a for a 10 year return reads 6 63 m almost exactly matching to comparable in situ recordings 2 5 peak spectral frequency to significant wave height relation according to widely accepted engineering practice sea states are described by wave spectrums the tabain s spectrum or t spectrum is a wave spectrum developed specifically for the adriatic sea it is a one parameter spectrum developed based on a 10 year wave observation and measurement campaign it is defined as follows 16 s ω 0 862 0 0135 g 2 ω 5 e x p 5 186 ω 4 h s 2 1 63 p where 17 p e x p ω ω m 2 2 σ 2 ω m 2 18 ω m 0 32 1 8 h s 0 6 while σ 0 08 f o r ω ω m and σ 0 1 f o r ω ω m the relation between the modal peak spectral wave frequency ω m and significant wave height h s given in the tabain s spectrum by eq 18 is validated against the data from the wwa database the comparison of modal frequencies from the database and from the tabain s spectrum is presented in fig 10 comparison for all sea states is presented in fig 10 left while comparison only for sea states with h s 2 m is shown in fig 10 right similar figures are obtained for other locations which are therefore not reproduced herein coefficients of determination of fitting tabain s modal angular frequency to data points are relatively low 0 33 0 44 and 0 45 at location a b and c respectively suggesting a limited capability of the tabain s spectrum to locate the spectral peaks it is also evident from fig 10 left that the expression given by tabain overestimates the most occurring frequencies for low significant wave heights while fig 10 right suggests that tabain s expression underestimates modal frequencies of the highest significant wave heights this indicates a necessity to revise the tabain s spectrum based on newly acquired data which is planned for future work 2 6 uncertainties in significant wave heights due to climate changes global warming due to human activities leads to changes in ocean environmental conditions compared with other environmental phenomena changes in waves and wind climate have the largest impact on marine structure design according to the review performed by bitner gregersen et al 2014 during the second half of the 20th century there seems to have been a 0 3 m decade increase in the average hs in the northwest region of north atlantic west of the british isles to the northern north sea and a 0 2 m decade decrease of mean hs in more southerly latitudes of north atlantic between coast of united states and north africa the general conclusion by bitner gregersen et al 2014 is that there are more rapid changes of extreme significant wave height than of mean values and also that the significant uncertainties are associated with climate change projections and there is a need for research to quantify them assessment of climate changes in enclosed sea basins such as the adriatic sea is more complicated as pointed out by bertotti and cavaleri 2009 the message from their paper is that conditions in an inner basin may be and often are quite different than in the oceans or in larger seas the reliability of the forecasts of waves is rather low because of strong temporal and spatial gradients of wind patterns they found that even a three day forecast of waves generated by bura in the adriatic may be unsatisfactory this calls for caution when interpreting results of long term forecasts of global climate changes as the one presented by benetazzo et al 2012 nevertheless it is worth mentioning that their forecast showed that relative to the present level the global adriatic sea wave severity is likely to decrease by 5 by the end of the 21th century they concluded that the design wave based on past events seems to lead to conservative conditions for a future scenario regarding design of new marine structures and on the safety of the existing ones in order to get insight in possible changes in wave heights in the last 24 years analysis of existing data is performed for three studied locations the benefit of such considerations is that it is based on the whole data set of past values calibrated by measurements therefore it is expected that the database has lower model uncertainty compared to forecasted data on the other side the existing database is clearly of limited duration for the purpose of analyzing climate changes where much longer records are required therefore the obtained result could be considered only as an indication of the effects of climate changes in fig 11 analysis of the variation of mean yearly significant wave height through the years is presented as may be seen from fig 11 there has been a slight increase of average h s through the years the increase of order of magnitude of 0 05 m decade is about 6 times less than in the north atlantic however as visible in fig 11 although the trend is clear and relatively consistent for all three locations the coefficient of determination is not very high 0 15 0 43 indicating a rather large uncertainty of such prediction there is an obvious sinusoidal variation of the mean yearly swh with a 10 year period but at this point physical basis of this phenomenon is not known changes of maximum yearly significant wave heights are also analysed but since there is no apparent trend corresponding graphs are not presented herein differences in maximum values through the years are very large resulting in an extremely low coefficient of determination 0 001 0 017 gramstad et al 2017 proposed the data being fitted to a model as a more thorough approach prior to reaching a firm conclusion in order to further explore consequences of climate changes on extreme values the number of storms in each year with significant wave height larger than 4 m is presented in fig 12 similarly as for the highest yearly hs there is no trend regarding the number of yearly occurrences of severe sea states with h s higher than 4 m the only clear conclusion from fig 12 is that the number of severe sea states in the north adriatic location a is much higher compared to the central and the south adriatic therefore it may be finally concluded that in the last two decades there have not been any direct consequences of global warming in terms of a more frequent appearance of rather high sea states in the adriatic 3 conclusions the adriatic sea has been recently receiving increasing geostrategic importance and is considered as a location for large lng and oil terminals sea transportation of dangerous goods in the adriatic is therefore expected to increase in future years therefore a better knowledge of its wave climate and development of models enabling a more reliable safety assessment of ships and offshore structures is considered to be of the outmost importance a comprehensive statistical analysis of wave parameters has been performed at locations in the south central and north adriatic along the major longitudinal shipping route data obtained from a 24 year database more comprehensive in space and time than those previously available acquired by a numerical hindcast and calibrated by satellite measurements have been processed sea state tables have been derived presenting wave activity across combinations of significant wave heights and peak periods significant wave heights smaller than 1 m generally occur in about 70 of sea states the highest significant wave heights have been recorded in the north adriatic while a more mid range activity is recorded in the south and the central adriatic regions this is in line with the expected as the highest in situ recorded waves are measured in the northern adriatic region during se quadrant jugo sirocco wind that features the longest fetch generating waves along the adriatic basin entering northern waters the south region is exposed to already formed waves entering from the mediterranean through the otranto strait to obtain a consistent environmental model the conditional modelling approach cma has been applied in accordance with dnv recommended practice for simultaneous probabilistic description of significant wave height and spectral peak period for significant wave height the 3 parameter weibull marginal probability distribution has been fitted its parameters have been optimized by the non linear least square method and given for all three locations conditional probability distribution of spectral wave peak periods is modelled by the log normal distribution to provide complete information across all wave heights linearized expressions have been derived for the mean and standard deviation of peak wave periods for different significant wave heights thus it is possible to estimate the expected spectral peak periods associated with extreme significant wave height with large return periods not included in the sea scatter tables quadratic regression equations relating significant wave height and wind speed have been derived for the two dominant wind patterns bura bora ne quadrant winds and jugo sirocco se quadrant winds the coefficient of determination in all cases is above 0 9 suggesting a fairly reliable approximation of actual data by regression equations the regression is compared to that found in the literature and bias is identified which arises mostly due to the fact the previous formulation taken from the literature has a free coefficient forecasting wave activity when there is no wind also regression equations are compared to cgwindwave software and good agreement of predicted significant wave height is found the regression provides a simple and straightforward tool that can be applied within the adriatic ship salvage framework or other maritime activities requesting rapid sea state estimation extreme wave heights have been calculated based on the weibull distribution for different return periods the results show good comparison to those found in literature highest extreme values are found in the north adriatic region the extreme significant wave height values calculated for a 100 year return period are 8 48 7 10 and 6 75 m for the north central and south adriatic respectively a relation of modal spectral frequency to significant wave height has been derived in the tabain s spectrum the modal frequency is calculated solely based on significant wave height this spectrum is widely accepted and has been used for decades by the local engineering community the most occurring frequencies for low significant wave heights are overestimated while modal frequencies of extreme significant wave heights are underestimated by the tabain s wave spectrum a poor coefficient of determination suggests the necessity for improvement of the local spectral definition based on a newly available database analysis of the possible consequence of climate changes on sea states in the adriatic shows that the mean yearly significant wave height has been increasing at a rate of about 0 05 m decade there are no trends of increasing either maximum significant wave heights or number of appearances of rather severe sea states in the last two and a half decades gradual increase of average sea states in the adriatic indicates that fatigue life assessment of offshore installations may be un conservative if based on constant met ocean parameters to the contrary structural strength of offshore structures assessed for extreme sea states is conservative if based on the present wave climate acknowledgement this work has been fully supported by the croatian science foundation under project 8658 the worldwaves data used in the study are provided by fugro oceanor as 
23411,based on a database of sea state parameters in the adriatic sea wave statistics has been developed at three different geographic locations along the busy adriatic shipping route the underlying database consists of a systematic numerical hindcast calibrated by 24 year satellite measurements and represents the most comprehensive data source of wave parameters available for the region joint probability distributions of significant wave heights and peak spectral periods are derived thus enabling extreme sea states to be determined furthermore waves have been evaluated with respect to the well known dominant wind patterns in the adriatic and compared to the tabain s spectrum a single parametric spectral description developed for local conditions and widely used in engineering practice statistics for three geographical locations are compared with one another as well as with data from other available references these long term statistics and regression equations developed can be used not only for fatigue and extreme wave loads of ships offshore installations and renewable energy devices intended for the adriatic sea but also for planning and carrying out various marine operations in that specific environment at the end of the study some consideration is given to the effects of climate changes on the variability of sea states in the adriatic keywords wave statistics satellite and numerical database adriatic sea 1 introduction the adriatic sea is a semi enclosed body of water connected to the mediterranean sea through the otranto strait at its southeast located between parallel mountain ranges of the apennines west and the dinarides east it experiences a specific wind wave climate with strong winds of limited fetch considering its enclosed nature a rich commercial activity poses a significant associated risk to its fragile ecological system therefore a better understanding of the wave climate in the adriatic is required to support sustainable and ecologically friendly shipbuilding maritime offshore mariculture renewable energy nautical tourism and related industries wave climate is important also for planning and decision making in the event of a marine accident parunov et al 2017 up to date statistical analyses of waves in the adriatic sea have been mostly based on gathered visual observations and occasional buoy measurements specifically for seagoing vessels an adopted approach for seakeeping response analysis is based on wave energy spectrum description ochi 1978 for the adriatic sea naval architects use a formulation given by tabain 1997 which is a one parameter wave spectrum dependent only on significant wave height hs the tabain s spectrum is derived by modification of the well known jonswap spectrum although of great importance to the maritime sector in the adriatic region the tabain s spectrum is derived mostly from observations and a limited number of measurements and therefore needs to be compared with recently acquired data the northern part of the adriatic sea the gulf of venice has relatively shallow waters and mild bottom slopes while its southern part reaches maximum water depths of up to 1200 m dominant wind events that cause surface waves in the adriatic are bura n ne to e ne italian bora jugo e se to ss e sirocco family and maestral w nw to nw bura and jugo reach storm conditions and can cause extreme wave occurrences while maestral is of milder character and important for recreational sailing due to its predictive nature especially during summer months katalinić et al 2015 a maximum wave height of 10 8 m was recorded as the highest maximum wave in the adriatic during an event of jugo wind while theoretical predictions of the most probable extreme significant wave heights for 20 and 100 year return periods read 7 20 and 8 57 m respectively leder et al 1998 bura n ne to e ne is the strongest wind by its intensity blowing over the dinaric mountains which shape its focus points across the adriatic by nature it blows in gales of more than 20 m s 72 km h and the fastest recorded wind impact of bura is 68 m s 245 km h in the mid adriatic coast line where the velebit mountain forms a funnel the main limitation for the development of bura wind waves is its relatively short fetch jugo blows along the adriatic e se to ss e and usually develops for several days until reaching its maximum speed waves already formed enter through the otranto strait s southern boundary and develop further along the adriatic reaching a more developed sea state and longer waves than those of bura which are inherently steeper and shorter in storm conditions jugo can reach speeds up to 30 m s over 100 km h katalinić et al 2015 nowadays there are two relevant wave atlases available and applicable for the adriatic medatlas cavaleri 2005 and worldwaves atlas barstow et al 2003 both databases are obtained by hindcasting using numerical wave modelling calibrated against satellite and wave buoy measurements this study is based on data from the worldwave atlas gathered during the last two decades up to recent dates statistical analysis of wave parameters is done for three representative geographical locations chosen in the northern central and southern adriatic sea located along the main longitudinal shipping route the main aim of this study is to develop long term statistics enabling prediction of extreme seas states at representative locations of three adriatic regions based on the acquired 24 year systematic database obtained by a satellite measurement calibration of a numerical hindcast wave model barstow et al 2003 for each location joint probability distribution of significant wave heights and peak spectral periods is established marginal distribution of wave heights enables to extrapolate existing data to long time periods and determine long term extreme significant wave heights conditional distribution of wave periods enables predicting wave periods of such extreme sea states extreme significant wave heights are compared with previously published results that are mostly obtained based on incomplete wave datasets knowledge of the simultaneous occurrence of wind speeds and significant wave heights is used to establish a functional relationship between wind speed and significant wave heights using regression analysis as the swell in the adriatic is rather low such relationship enables quick and reliable prediction of significant wave heights solely from wind data database enables also to establish a relationship between significant wave height and spectral peak periods in order to check adequacy of the single parametric tabain s wave spectrum commonly used in seakeeping studies in the adriatic the long term sea states are usually defined under the assumption that sea states have the same statistical distribution i e the climate conditions are stationary however statistical approaches based on the assumption of stationarity would lead to invalid conclusions in the case of climate change although the present 24 year database is clearly rather short to analyse climate variability vanem 2015 it has nevertheless been used to get some insight into the variation of sea state parameters in the last two and a half decades the paper begins with the literature review in section 1 1 covering systematic studies of waves in the adriatic that started in the mid 20th century after world war ii up to the current date the database used in the present study is described in section 1 2 a joint probability distribution model of significant wave height and spectral peak period is developed in section 2 2 based on det norske veritas recommendations for environmental conditions and loads modelling dnv 2014 in section 2 3 a regression model relating wind speed and significant wave height for two dominant wind patterns jugo and bura is presented a statistical estimate of extreme sea states for various return periods is provided in section 2 4 in section 2 5 the peak spectral frequency to significant wave height relation resulting from the dataset is compared with the commonly used tabain s wave spectrum to determine its suitability changes of average and extreme sea states through the years as a possible consequence of the climate variability are analysed in section 2 6 the paper ends with the corresponding conclusions emphasizing the obtained results and acquired tools and giving the geostrategic context of the adriatic sea 1 1 literature review of sea state statistics in the adriatic sea first research work on wave statistics in the adriatic sea was performed by tabain 1974 he used visual observations and reports from meteorological naval and merchant ships in the adriatic and developed a rather rough wave statistics considering the wind wave specificities of the basin he also developed a sea state scale for the adriatic sea and gave its relation against the wmo scale later on he derived the tabain s wave spectrum which has been commonly used for local purposes until today tabain 1997 senjanović et al 2000 a systematic wave statistics based on long term 1957 1971 visual ship observations has been reported in the climatology atlas published by the hydrographic institute of the republic of croatia 1979 it contains monthly averages of wave height occurrences from basic incoming direction represented in the form of wave roses although basically covering the complete adriatic basin it inherits all drawbacks of visual wave observations from ships systematic underestimation of observed significant wave heights parunov et al 2011 and the lack of data for highest sea states as they are avoided by ships guedes soares 1986 the accuracy of the visual wave observations has been questioned in the literature since the 1990s especially concerning the wave period bitner gregersen et al 2016 parunov et al 2011 used this climatology atlas to develop wave statistics in the adriatic they concluded that sea states with significant wave heights between 0 5 and 1 m are the most frequent in the adriatic sea sea states with significant wave heights larger than 4 m were observed quite rarely while significant wave heights larger than 5 m were almost never encountered by merchant ships more severe sea states up to significant wave heights of 7 m were recorded only by measurements from fixed offshore platforms more recent work includes the application of third generation numerical wave models e g wam swan janekovic and tudor 2005 made preliminary validation of the swan wave model ris et al 1999 for bura wind conditions with wind simulation input acquired from the national meteorological organization and compared the results with wave buoy recordings two operational numerical wave models are available online for real time estimation of sea states in the adriatic the wam model is run by the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf and the wwm ii model is run with an even higher resolution than the ecmwf s model by a privately owned company called gekom www gekom hr wave climate in the adriatic has also been examined for civil engineering purposes by ocvirk 2010 in her phd thesis by application of a commercial numerical wave model mike21 bertotti and cavaleri 2009 analysed the quality of the wind and wave predictions in the adriatic sea considering the corresponding analysis and forecast fields of the ecmwf up to 72 h they used the wam model to forecast wave fields and offered firm evidences that in an enclosed sea the capability of producing successful forecasts beyond a limited time extent is greatly reduced with respect to the oceans furthermore they concluded that the reliability of the forecasts substantially decreases when dealing with meteorological events characterized by strong temporal and spatial gradients as is typical during bura wind this indicates that any wave forecast in the adriatic sea should be taken with great caution satellite altimetry measurements have been reported in depth by queffeulou and bentamy 2007 interesting conclusion from their study is that the adriatic is the mildest sea basin in the mediterranean with an average significant wave height of 0 85 m while 80 of the data are less than 1 10 m research on waves as a renewable energy resource focusing on the adriatic sea was performed by liberti et al 2013 combining both satellite measurement and numerical models referencing also to available buoy in situ measurements ron project along the adriatic s west coast they confirmed that although the adriatic is a low average wave power area the wave power may reach considerable values comparable with those encountered in the more productive regions of the world the 24 year oceanor wave parameter database has been used recently to improve wave statistics in the middle adriatic by farkas et al 2016 as well as by mudronja et al 2017 to examine the possibility of using neural networks for wave height modelling a study on expected wind wave severity changes in the adriatic sea for the period 2070 2099 and their impact on extremes are presented by benetazzo et al 2012 to do so the swan spectral wave model was forced using wind fields computed by a high resolution regional climate model statistical analysis of waves was performed and compared to the results of another 30 year simulation from 1965 to 1994 results showed a future wave climate in the adriatic sea milder than the present climate even though increases of wave severity can occur locally according to that study global warming due to the enhanced greenhouse effect will not affect wind generated waves in the adriatic 1 2 worldwaves atlas worldwaves atlas wwa is a group name for high resolution interactive wind and wave atlases wwa is developed primarily based on satellite measurements validated by in situ measurements by wave buoys and hindcasted by numerical wave modelling bitner gregersen et al 2016 pointed out that such wave hindcast datasets properly validated against in situ and satellite data are nowadays considered as the best data choice for development of design and operation criteria for marine structures wwa includes satellite altimeter data at full resolution from the following satellite missions geosat 1986 1989 topex 1992 2002

is measured each time a satellite passes and wind speed is estimated by a parametric model satellite data is validated based on wave buoy data given that the pass cycle of the satellite is about 10 35 days gathered data do not have a sufficiently high temporal resolution to provide systematic high resolution data satellite measurements are combined with state of the art numerical models i e the numerical model is calibrated by satellite measurements wwa applies a third generation wave model wam for deep sea waves it is run on a daily basis by the ecmwf barstow et al 2003 the acquired database includes 39 uniformly distributed locations across the adriatic sea fig 1 left all of them being calibration points by altimetry measurements collected along satellite tracks fig 1 right the selected and analysed locations are location a 44 5 n 13 5 e northern adriatic sea location b 43 0 n 15 5 e central adriatic sea location c 41 5 n 17 5 e southern adriatic sea at each location twelve physical wave and wind parameters are given plus the date and time at six hour intervals four per day each location has 34 460 data outputs in total starting from september 1992 to the end of january 2016 the available parameters are provided in table 1 while in fig 2 an example of significant wave height timeline is given for a one year period in table 1 mean wave periods are energy periods defined in terms of spectral moments as m 1 m0 2 methodolgy and results in the present study statistical analysis of the oceanor database for the adriatic has been performed due to a large number of measurements to be processed matlab computing software has been used algorithms within the software have been developed to facilitate data processing for different locations in the future in order to provide met ocean data for scientific and engineering work the results of these algorithms are presented in this study 2 1 sea state tables significant wave height hs and spectral peak or zero crossing period tp tz represent the most important sea state parameters for design and operations of ships and offshore structures sea state tables organizing the number of recorded significant wave height swh and spectral peak period pp1d occurrences into classes for a specific location have been generated significant wave height classes are given in meters with 0 5 m increment per class between 0 and 6 5 m peak period classes are defined with 1 s increments between 0 and 14 s from a total of 34 460 data logs for each location in the database there are occasional data missing these lines have been excluded prior to processing and analysing the statistics frequencies of occurrence of different sea states are presented in tables 2 4 for the north central and south adriatic respectively in the last row and column of the table total number of occurrences in the specific class has been also given for significant wave heights and wave spectral peak periods respectively below each table the percentage of occurrences of significant wave heights lower than 1 m and the highest recorded significant wave height with date when it was recorded are also reported percentage of wave occurrence by direction divided in 30 bins and by significant wave height h s is conveniently presented by wave roses wave roses for three studied locations are shown in fig 3 it can be seen from fig 3 that there is a higher frequency of bura ne quadrant wind waves in the north while maestral nw quadrant and jugo se quadrant wind waves prevail in the central and south locations in general the adriatic experiences a fairly mild wave climate 2 2 joint probability distribution of significant wave heights and peak wave periods after obtaining a sea state table for selected locations a joint probability distribution model is fitted aiming to determine parameters of extreme sea states with large return periods being outside the sea state tables and also to enable consistent treatment of loading in a fatigue and strength analysis of ships and offshore structures methods to fit join probability distributions of wind waves current and sea water level are reviewed by bitner gregersen 2012 for joint probabilistic modelling of wind waves and peak spectral periods when complete probabilistic information obtained from simultaneous observations of the environmental variables are available as in the present study the conditional modelling approach cma is recommended bitner gregersen 2012 dnv 2014 in general the joint density function in this method is defined by a marginal distribution and series of conditional density functions each of which is modelled using parametric functions that are fitted to the conditioned data using some form of estimation process 2 2 1 marginal distribution of significant wave heights proposed cma uses the 3 parameter weibull probability density function pdf as a marginal pdf of significant wave height swh or h s equation 1 1 f h s h ˆ s α θ h ˆ s ε θ α 1 exp h ˆ s ε θ α where ε is the location θ the scale and α is the shape parameter all evaluated from the actual data by the least square method lsm the peak period pp1d or t p conditional on swh is modelled by a log normal probability density function given by equation 2 2 f t z h s t p h ˆ s 1 σ l n t p t p 2 π exp ln t p μ l n t p 2 2 σ l n t p 2 where the distribution parameters μ ln t p mean of logarithms of the variable and σ ln t p standard deviation of logarithms of the variable are functions of swh and are evaluated from actual data parunov 2000 the 3 parameter weibull cumulative probability distribution is given as 3 f h s p h ˆ s h s 1 exp h ˆ s ε θ α h s h ˆ s ε p h ˆ s h s represents the probability that the random variable significant wave height h ˆ s takes a lower value than a certain h s the probability of h s being exceeded is then given as 4 q h ˆ s 1 p h ˆ s for each value h s i from tables 2 4 the empirical exceedance probability is given by the commonly used expression parunov 2000 parunov et al 2011 5 q h s i j 1 i f j n 1 where j 1 i f j represents the cumulative frequency of all values larger or equal to h s i while n represents the total number of observations total sum of observations as given in the sea state tables the empirical probability p h ˆ s i that h s i is not exceeded is then given by equation 4 to determine the theoretical weibull fit parameters the expression 3 is logarithmized twice to obtain the linear model in the following form 6 ln ln 1 f h s α ln h s ε α l n θ the distribution can then be seen as a linear relation of ln h s ε and ln ln 1 f h s as presented in fig 4 the linear relation coefficients a slope and b ordinate intersection are determined by the least square method lsm and subsequently the weibull shape α and scale θ parameters are determined according to 7 α a 8 θ e b a the described procedure in eqs 6 8 is performed within an outer optimization loop in which the value of the location parameter ε is calculated by minimizing the sum of the lsm residuum a similar procedure is employed by mansour and preston 1995 fitting results for analysed locations are shown in table 5 2 2 2 conditional probability distribution of the peak wave periods distribution of wave spectral peak periods pp1d for a certain significant wave height class is described by the log normal distribution an example evaluation of fit parameters at selected locations is presented in fig 5 for swh between 0 5 and 1 0 m summarized log normal parameters fit values are presented in table 6 this wave class represents the most frequent swh class with about 38 of occurrence in average for all three locations according to sea state tables log normal distribution parameters given in eq 2 for a given swh and a pp1d class interval of 1 s are evaluated as follows log mean μ l n t p 9 μ l n t p l n μ t p 2 σ t p 2 μ t p 2 log standard deviation σ l n t p 10 σ l n t p ln 1 σ t p 2 μ t p 2 and these variables in turn depend on the mean μ t p 2 and variance σ t p 2 fitting of the theoretical distribution to the measured pp1d data for swh class 0 5 1 0 m is presented in fig 5 for the three locations the mean and the standard deviation of peak spectral wave periods are also given as a function of the swh class range to provide a complete description of sea states the relation between the significant wave height h s at a logarithmic scale and the spectral peak period parameters can reasonably be presented as a linear fit fig 6 in this way the mean μ t p and the standard deviation σ t p can be evaluated as a function of h s 11 μ t p a ln h s b 12 σ t p c ln h s d where coefficients a b c and d are given below in table 7 along with respective coefficients of determination r 2 which are a goodness of fit measure from 0 worst to 1 best it can be noticed that the applied procedure gives the best coefficient of determination for the north adriatic location a a lower coefficient of determination for standard deviation is a consequence of a small number of measurements for high sea states 2 3 relationship of wind speed and wind sea height in the adriatic sea a regression model of wind speed to wave height is defined for the selected locations fig 7 as bura and jugo winds generate waves of different characteristics regression equations are separately developed for each of them more advanced joint probabilistic models for wind speed u w and significant wave height h s are described and recommended in literature bitner gregersen 2012 but a quadratic regression curve is chosen for its simplicity and good fit results this relation allows for a fast significant wave height forecast tool at a specified location based solely on wind speed typically measured 10 m above sea level that can be easily acquired from the national meteorological service a quadratic relation is chosen for the regression equation katalinić et al 2014 relating significant wave height h s and wind speed u w 13 h s e u w 2 f u w parameters e and f of eq 13 for all locations with respective coefficient of determination r 2 are given in table 8 very high values of r 2 may be noticed in table 8 the modelled wind speed to wave height relation is compared to regression relations provided by leder et al 1998 for the north adriatic at location a and to results obtained by cgwindwaves runet 2016 software significant wave height and wave spectrum evaluated by cgwindwaves software are based on bretschenider s relation and they are calculated within the software as a function of fetch water depth and wind speed with directional spectrum effects included by the effective fetch method a comparison of the regression model obtained in the present study with those of leder et al 1998 and the results obtained by cgwindwaves software is presented in fig 8 graphs presented in fig 8 show a different trend for bura and a bias for jugo compared to relations found in literature leder et al 1998 for the north adriatic in general relations developed in the present study show a good consistency with cgwindwave for bura fig 8 left except for the highest wind speeds where bretschneider s relation underestimated the significant wave height 2 4 extreme sea states calculation of long term extreme values of significant wave heights is based on previously defined weibull distribution long term extreme significant wave heights are given depending on the return period rp in years wist 2003 after defining the theoretical distribution function for a random variable h ˆ s probability of exceeding certain h s in a specified return period is given by equation 14 14 q h s r p t r e g n 1 r p where t reg is the duration of uninterrupted observation 23 5 years h ˆ s is a random wave height and n represents the number of samples total sum of observations as given in the sea state tables when a certain probability of exceeding a random variable h ˆ s is determined using the weibull fit the value of a certain wave height being exceeded in a specific return period is calculated by equation 15 15 h s r p θ ln q h s r p 1 α ε where α ε and θ are weibull parameters of the marginal distribution of hs determined in section 2 2 1 the extreme significant wave height calculation results are given in fig 9 along with extremes calculated by leder et al 1998 who applied the maximum likelihood method on the f t i fisher and tippett distribution for a location in the north adriatic that is close to location a the obtained results for location a show good consistency with the curve given by leder et al 1998 which is expected as they apply for the same region extreme values of significant wave height for different return periods are given in table 9 the obtained values for location a can also be compared to maximum in situ measurements by offshore platforms located in the north adriatic the absolute maximum significant wave height was 6 58 m in a 10 year return period during a storm in 1979 with single highest wave record of 10 2 m parunov at al 2011 the single highest wave ever recorded was 10 8 m high in 1986 the calculated extreme value for the north adriatic location a for a 10 year return reads 6 63 m almost exactly matching to comparable in situ recordings 2 5 peak spectral frequency to significant wave height relation according to widely accepted engineering practice sea states are described by wave spectrums the tabain s spectrum or t spectrum is a wave spectrum developed specifically for the adriatic sea it is a one parameter spectrum developed based on a 10 year wave observation and measurement campaign it is defined as follows 16 s ω 0 862 0 0135 g 2 ω 5 e x p 5 186 ω 4 h s 2 1 63 p where 17 p e x p ω ω m 2 2 σ 2 ω m 2 18 ω m 0 32 1 8 h s 0 6 while σ 0 08 f o r ω ω m and σ 0 1 f o r ω ω m the relation between the modal peak spectral wave frequency ω m and significant wave height h s given in the tabain s spectrum by eq 18 is validated against the data from the wwa database the comparison of modal frequencies from the database and from the tabain s spectrum is presented in fig 10 comparison for all sea states is presented in fig 10 left while comparison only for sea states with h s 2 m is shown in fig 10 right similar figures are obtained for other locations which are therefore not reproduced herein coefficients of determination of fitting tabain s modal angular frequency to data points are relatively low 0 33 0 44 and 0 45 at location a b and c respectively suggesting a limited capability of the tabain s spectrum to locate the spectral peaks it is also evident from fig 10 left that the expression given by tabain overestimates the most occurring frequencies for low significant wave heights while fig 10 right suggests that tabain s expression underestimates modal frequencies of the highest significant wave heights this indicates a necessity to revise the tabain s spectrum based on newly acquired data which is planned for future work 2 6 uncertainties in significant wave heights due to climate changes global warming due to human activities leads to changes in ocean environmental conditions compared with other environmental phenomena changes in waves and wind climate have the largest impact on marine structure design according to the review performed by bitner gregersen et al 2014 during the second half of the 20th century there seems to have been a 0 3 m decade increase in the average hs in the northwest region of north atlantic west of the british isles to the northern north sea and a 0 2 m decade decrease of mean hs in more southerly latitudes of north atlantic between coast of united states and north africa the general conclusion by bitner gregersen et al 2014 is that there are more rapid changes of extreme significant wave height than of mean values and also that the significant uncertainties are associated with climate change projections and there is a need for research to quantify them assessment of climate changes in enclosed sea basins such as the adriatic sea is more complicated as pointed out by bertotti and cavaleri 2009 the message from their paper is that conditions in an inner basin may be and often are quite different than in the oceans or in larger seas the reliability of the forecasts of waves is rather low because of strong temporal and spatial gradients of wind patterns they found that even a three day forecast of waves generated by bura in the adriatic may be unsatisfactory this calls for caution when interpreting results of long term forecasts of global climate changes as the one presented by benetazzo et al 2012 nevertheless it is worth mentioning that their forecast showed that relative to the present level the global adriatic sea wave severity is likely to decrease by 5 by the end of the 21th century they concluded that the design wave based on past events seems to lead to conservative conditions for a future scenario regarding design of new marine structures and on the safety of the existing ones in order to get insight in possible changes in wave heights in the last 24 years analysis of existing data is performed for three studied locations the benefit of such considerations is that it is based on the whole data set of past values calibrated by measurements therefore it is expected that the database has lower model uncertainty compared to forecasted data on the other side the existing database is clearly of limited duration for the purpose of analyzing climate changes where much longer records are required therefore the obtained result could be considered only as an indication of the effects of climate changes in fig 11 analysis of the variation of mean yearly significant wave height through the years is presented as may be seen from fig 11 there has been a slight increase of average h s through the years the increase of order of magnitude of 0 05 m decade is about 6 times less than in the north atlantic however as visible in fig 11 although the trend is clear and relatively consistent for all three locations the coefficient of determination is not very high 0 15 0 43 indicating a rather large uncertainty of such prediction there is an obvious sinusoidal variation of the mean yearly swh with a 10 year period but at this point physical basis of this phenomenon is not known changes of maximum yearly significant wave heights are also analysed but since there is no apparent trend corresponding graphs are not presented herein differences in maximum values through the years are very large resulting in an extremely low coefficient of determination 0 001 0 017 gramstad et al 2017 proposed the data being fitted to a model as a more thorough approach prior to reaching a firm conclusion in order to further explore consequences of climate changes on extreme values the number of storms in each year with significant wave height larger than 4 m is presented in fig 12 similarly as for the highest yearly hs there is no trend regarding the number of yearly occurrences of severe sea states with h s higher than 4 m the only clear conclusion from fig 12 is that the number of severe sea states in the north adriatic location a is much higher compared to the central and the south adriatic therefore it may be finally concluded that in the last two decades there have not been any direct consequences of global warming in terms of a more frequent appearance of rather high sea states in the adriatic 3 conclusions the adriatic sea has been recently receiving increasing geostrategic importance and is considered as a location for large lng and oil terminals sea transportation of dangerous goods in the adriatic is therefore expected to increase in future years therefore a better knowledge of its wave climate and development of models enabling a more reliable safety assessment of ships and offshore structures is considered to be of the outmost importance a comprehensive statistical analysis of wave parameters has been performed at locations in the south central and north adriatic along the major longitudinal shipping route data obtained from a 24 year database more comprehensive in space and time than those previously available acquired by a numerical hindcast and calibrated by satellite measurements have been processed sea state tables have been derived presenting wave activity across combinations of significant wave heights and peak periods significant wave heights smaller than 1 m generally occur in about 70 of sea states the highest significant wave heights have been recorded in the north adriatic while a more mid range activity is recorded in the south and the central adriatic regions this is in line with the expected as the highest in situ recorded waves are measured in the northern adriatic region during se quadrant jugo sirocco wind that features the longest fetch generating waves along the adriatic basin entering northern waters the south region is exposed to already formed waves entering from the mediterranean through the otranto strait to obtain a consistent environmental model the conditional modelling approach cma has been applied in accordance with dnv recommended practice for simultaneous probabilistic description of significant wave height and spectral peak period for significant wave height the 3 parameter weibull marginal probability distribution has been fitted its parameters have been optimized by the non linear least square method and given for all three locations conditional probability distribution of spectral wave peak periods is modelled by the log normal distribution to provide complete information across all wave heights linearized expressions have been derived for the mean and standard deviation of peak wave periods for different significant wave heights thus it is possible to estimate the expected spectral peak periods associated with extreme significant wave height with large return periods not included in the sea scatter tables quadratic regression equations relating significant wave height and wind speed have been derived for the two dominant wind patterns bura bora ne quadrant winds and jugo sirocco se quadrant winds the coefficient of determination in all cases is above 0 9 suggesting a fairly reliable approximation of actual data by regression equations the regression is compared to that found in the literature and bias is identified which arises mostly due to the fact the previous formulation taken from the literature has a free coefficient forecasting wave activity when there is no wind also regression equations are compared to cgwindwave software and good agreement of predicted significant wave height is found the regression provides a simple and straightforward tool that can be applied within the adriatic ship salvage framework or other maritime activities requesting rapid sea state estimation extreme wave heights have been calculated based on the weibull distribution for different return periods the results show good comparison to those found in literature highest extreme values are found in the north adriatic region the extreme significant wave height values calculated for a 100 year return period are 8 48 7 10 and 6 75 m for the north central and south adriatic respectively a relation of modal spectral frequency to significant wave height has been derived in the tabain s spectrum the modal frequency is calculated solely based on significant wave height this spectrum is widely accepted and has been used for decades by the local engineering community the most occurring frequencies for low significant wave heights are overestimated while modal frequencies of extreme significant wave heights are underestimated by the tabain s wave spectrum a poor coefficient of determination suggests the necessity for improvement of the local spectral definition based on a newly available database analysis of the possible consequence of climate changes on sea states in the adriatic shows that the mean yearly significant wave height has been increasing at a rate of about 0 05 m decade there are no trends of increasing either maximum significant wave heights or number of appearances of rather severe sea states in the last two and a half decades gradual increase of average sea states in the adriatic indicates that fatigue life assessment of offshore installations may be un conservative if based on constant met ocean parameters to the contrary structural strength of offshore structures assessed for extreme sea states is conservative if based on the present wave climate acknowledgement this work has been fully supported by the croatian science foundation under project 8658 the worldwaves data

23412,this study investigates the interaction between two cylinders of an identical diameter immersed in still fluid the master cylinder is subject to forced vibration while the adjacent slave cylinder is elastically mounted and has only one degree of freedom along the centreline of the two cylinders the hydrodynamic interaction is simulated with an extensively validated 2d navier stokes solver that is based on the finite element method and the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian method extensive simulations are conducted with a fixed reynolds number of 100 the initial clearance distance normalised by the cylinder diameter ranges from 0 2 to 1 0 the mass ratio of the cylinder over the displaced fluid ranges from 1 5 to 2 5 the vibrating amplitude of the master cylinder normalised by the cylinder diameter varies from 0 025 to 0 1 frequencies of the master s vibration normalised by the slave s structural natural frequency ranges from 0 05 to 2 4 when the frequency of the master cylinder reaches the immersed natural frequency of the slave cylinder the slave cylinder s vibration observes resonance and the phase difference between the two cylinders movement experiences a 180 shift in resonance the slave master phase difference is about 90 the frequency of the vibration is found to significantly affect the flow features keywords flow around circular cylinders flow induced vibration resonance computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction flow mediated interactions can be found in various natural and engineering contexts objects moving in a fluid can interact with the neighbouring objects through the disturbed fluid between them the subsequent motion of the neighbouring objects is of greater complexity than that of the objects subjected to a prescribed moving fluid flow mediated interaction is relevant to fish schooling liao 2003 gazzola et al 2016 dolphin drafting weihs 2004 swimming of micro organisms gyrya et al 2010 ishikawa et al 2006 koch and subramanian 2011 the interference between risers bampalas and graham 2008 sperm egg interaction riffell and zimmer 2007 formation of solid particle clusters voth et al 2002 and dispersion of particle clouds metzger et al 2007 these phenomena have been the subject of experimental and numerical investigations aiming to identify the characteristics of the interactions the findings of these studies have the potential to be exploited in engineering applications e g vortex induced vibration energy harvesters bernitsas et al 2008 and self propulsion devices van rees et al 2015 relevant to the flow mediated interactions between circular cylinders numerous studies have been conducted over the past decades to investigate the fluid structure interactions containing only a single oscillating cylinder despite the simple geometry this problem involves a rich spectrum of physics and carries practical implications in ocean engineering and oil and gas industry particularly for the risers of the deep sea oil drilling platforms for a circular cylinder immersed in a fluid oscillating sinusoidally a scenario can be determined by two independent parameters i e the keulegan carpenter number and reynolds number the keulegan carpenter number can be defined as k c u m t d where u m is the amplitude of the oscillatory flow velocity t the period of oscillatory flow and d the diameter of the cylinder the reynolds number is defined as r e m u m d ν where ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity williamson 1985 carried out experiments to examine how the forces upon an oscillating cylinder are related to the vortex shedding he found that the number of vortex pairs shed from the cylinder per flow cycle increases with k c based on this pattern five flow regimes were identified tatsuno and bearman 1990 further investigated the flow features and found eight flow regimes based on flow visualization i e regimes a a b c d e f g in most of these flow regimes the three dimensional 3d flow was noticed only regimes a and a turned out to be two dimensional 2d in the present study the vibration of both cylinders is well within regime a which is characterized by the 2d and symmetrical flows based on the regimes categorised by tatsuno and bearman 1990 elston et al 2006 identified two fundamentally different types of symmetry breaking instability in the single cylinder oscillation case one is 2d instability and the other is 3d instability dütsch et al 1998 conducted laser doppler anemometry lda measurements and numerical simulations of a laminar flow induced by the harmonic oscillation of a circular cylinder in otherwise still water reporting reliable agreement between numerical and experimental results by comparing with these experimental results lin et al 2017 validated an in house 2d navier stokes model that is the basis of the present study zhao and cheng 2014 numerically studied the oscillatory flow past two circular cylinders they found that in the side by side arrangement with small gap ratios the vortex shedding from the gap of the two cylinders dominates resulting in the unique gap vortex shedding gvs regime which cannot be found for a single cylinder case in the tandem arrangement with a very small gap between the two cylinders the flow regimes are similar to that of a single cylinder a strong interaction between the vortex shedding flows from the two cylinders makes the flow notably irregular at large kc values in both side by side and tandem arrangements in contrast to the abundant research on the cylinders vibrating in a still fluid the research on the flow mediated interaction between multiple immersed cylinders is relatively rare lamb 1932 investigated the interaction between two spheres submerged in inviscid fluid one sphere is forced to oscillate along the centre line whereas the other nearby sphere of neutral buoyancy responds freely to the disturbed fluid by theoretical analysis lamb 1932 found that the free sphere is on the whole attracted towards the oscillating sphere due to the imbalanced pressure force by both analytical and numerical methods nair and kanso 2007 investigated an identical configuration in greater detail but for the case of two cylinders rather than two spheres one cylinder is started impulsively and is forced to oscillate along the centre line between two cylinders whereas the second responds freely nair and kanso 2007 found that depending on the initial phase i e initial velocity direction of the oscillation the free cylinder can be either repelled away or attracted towards the oscillating cylinder they further suggested that this should also be true for the spheres considered by lamb 1932 whose analysis only captured the attraction the flow mediated interaction between two cylinders was further studied by gazzola et al 2012 but the fluid was taken to be viscous rather than an inviscid gazzola et al 2012 discovered the threshold reynolds number beyond which the slave or passive cylinder is repelled by the master or active cylinder and under which it is attracted to the master cylinder a secondary flow structure is discovered between the two cylinders an increase in reynolds number i e a decrease in viscosity slows down the dissipation of the secondary flow which favours the repulsion of the slave cylinder by the master they further discovered that the threshold reynolds number is not affected by the initial phase of the master i e the phase of the initial impulsive vibration of the master cylinder this conclusion is different from that drawn in nair and kanso 2007 for the inviscid flow scenario where the repulsion or attraction is found to be governed by the initial phase of the movement the threshold reynolds number decreases exponentially with the increase in the initial gap whereas it is not substantially affected by the size difference between the two cylinders based on these observations gazzola et al 2012 concluded that the flow features have a greater influence than the inertia of the slave cylinder therefore in the present study the diameters of the slave and the master cylinders are configured to be the same gazzola et al 2012 also found that given a very small vibration amplitude of the master cylinder the level of repulsion or attraction is significantly reduced in summary there has not been sufficient research on the flow mediated interaction between immersed objects and the existing limited research all considers the case where the slave object has the same density as the mediated fluid and is completely free to move under the unbalanced hydrodynamic force however in actual engineering applications a vibrating structure is often of a different density from the fluid and is almost certainly elastically mounted 2 problem setup and numerical method in this study two identical rigid cylinders are placed in otherwise still fluid as seen in fig 1 at time zero the master cylinder starts to vibrate harmonically to disturb the fluid whereas the slave cylinder which has 1 degree of freedom 1dof in the y direction vibrates correspondingly under the action of the imbalanced hydrodynamic force the two cylinders are initially separated by a gap of g the non dimensional analysis shows that it requires five non dimensional parameters to define the problem i e gap ratio g d frequency of the master cylinder a 1 d amplitude of

mass of the fluid displaced by the slave cylinder and ν the kinematic viscosity simulations are conducted for a range of combinations of parameters but the reynolds number is maintained constant as r

7 2 0 2 2 or 2 5 the gap ratio g d varies from 0 2 to 1 0 with an increment of 0 1 in total 7448 combinations of parameters are examined the reynolds number r e m is fixed at 100 to limit the complexity of the studied problem and ensure the physical relevance of the present dns results the tested frequency of the master cylinder s vibration f 1 f n ranges from 0 05 to 2 4 which covers all the resonating frequencies of the slave cylinder s response as will be explained in section 5 1 the amplitude of the master cylinder a 1 d varies from 0 025 to 0 1 with the given r e m 100 the keulegan carpenter numbers and the stokes numbers of the master cylinder can then be calculated to be k c 2 π a 1 d 0 157 0 628 and β r e m k c 159 637 respectively hence the flow considered in this study is well within regime a which is symmetrical two dimensional flow without any vortex shedding as described in tatsuno and bearman 1990 these selections of parameters ensure the validity of the 2d navier stokes simulations if the master cylinder s oscillation amplitude a 1 d is too large the flow regime will no longer be a and the slave cylinder s response may undergo bifurcations to become unstable which is beyond the scope of the present analyses the tested mass ratio m varies from 1 5 1 7 2 0 2 2 to 2 5 these low mass ratios are typical for engineering structures immersed in water e g the mass ratio of concrete in water is about 2 5 the initial gap ratio g d ranges from 0 2 to 1 0 at g d 0 2 collision may occur and complicate the numerical study whereas at g d 1 0 the master slave interaction becomes weak and trivial the two dimensional navier stokes equations are solved by the petrov galerkin finite element method pg fem the moving cylinder boundaries are handled through the use of an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale scheme in the governing equations the length time velocity and pressure are non dimensional quantities according to 1 x i x i d t f n t u i u i f n d p p ρ

the slave cylinder and f y 2 is the force acting on the slave cylinder in the y direction 3 mesh independence study a close up of the computational mesh around the cylinders is illustrated in fig 2 a with g d 0 2 as an example it has 16 407 nodes in total the complete computational domain is of a square shape with the side length of 30 d which has been shown zhao and cheng 2014 to be sufficiently large to eliminate the boundary effects the mesh is a combination of structured around the cylinders and unstructured far from the cylinders types the number of elements along each cylinder circumference n c is 152 and the minimum non dimensional mesh size in the radial direction δ r is 1 30 10 3 the non dimensional time step δ t in the simulation is chosen based on the courant condition δ t 0 00025 u m 0 00025 d f n 2 π a 1 f 1 i e the courant number is δ t u m δ r 0 19 1 where u m is the non dimensional maximum vibration velocity of the master a mesh dependency study is conducted to ensure that the mesh is sufficiently dense to obtain converged results in this research the test case with g d 0 2 a 1 d 0 1 f 1 f n 0 825 ζ 0 and m 2 5 is chosen for the mesh dependency study this is a challenging case because of the large vibration amplitude of the slave cylinder which results in a very small distance between the two cylinder in a certain duration of a cycle the temporarily small proximity of the two cylinders adversely affects the accuracy of the computation as the computational cells in the gap are greatly squeezed and stretched periodically simulations are conducted in two scenarios scenario a has a constant n c 116 with δ r 2 65 10 4 3 22 10 4 4 49 10 4 6 36 10 4 9 21 10 4 1 38 10 3 2 21 10 3 3 87 10 3 and 2 43 10 2 in a series of meshes with different resolutions scenario b has constant δ r 9 10 4 while n c 62 80 98 116 134 152 170 188 206 224 242 260 and 278 in a series of meshes with different resolutions fig 3 a and fig 3b show the variations of a 2 d with δ r and n c respectively a 2 is calculated to be y m a x y m i n 2 where y m a x and y m i n are the maximum and minimum respectively of the y 2 values in the last 50 periods of steady oscillations it can be seen that the change in a 2 d is negligible when δ r 1 38 10 3 and n c 152 in conclusion a mesh with δ r 1 30 10 3 and n c 152 would be sufficiently fine to achieve converged results hence all the simulations adopted a resolution no coarser than this 4 model validation the numerical methods including the fem descretisation the solution of the vibration equation treatment of the moving boundary and adaptation of the mesh close to the boundary have all been validated in many previous studies zhao 2013 zhao and yan 2013 zhao et al 2013 cui et al 2014 zhao and cheng 2014 lin et al 2016 with regard to the present study we first consider a single cylinder oscillating harmonically in an otherwise still fluid at k c 5 r e m 100 to validate our numerical method the simulation is conducted on a mesh shown in fig 2b and the simulation results are compared with the experimental data obtained by dütsch et al 1998 as shown in fig 4 the horizontal and vertical components u v of the simulated and measured velocities are compared along four horizontal sections i e y d 0 6 0 0 6 and 1 2 at three phases i e ϕ 180 210 and 330 it can be seen that the simulation results match well with the experimental data in addition to the harmonic oscillation of a single cylinder we consider a case study that involves the interaction between two cylinders to validate the present numerical method in this case study the master cylinder is forced to oscillate along the centre line of the two cylinders whereas the slave cylinder is neutrally buoyant m 1 and is free to move in the fluid subject to unbalanced hydrodynamic force initially both cylinders are at rest and the master cylinder impulsively starts the oscillation by moving towards the slave cylinder the diameters of the two cylinders are identical while the master cylinder s vibration amplitude is fixed at a 1 d 1 0 the simulation results of the present numerical model are compared with that of gazzola et al 2012 who discovered the threshold reynolds numbers above which the slave cylinder is repelled away from the master and below which the slave cylinder is attracted towards the master the threshold reynolds number is shown to be a function of the initial distance between the two cylinders as seen in fig 5 a to illustrate how the threshold reynolds number is obtained from the present simulations the slave cylinder s displacements are plotted at a series of reynolds numbers in fig 5b the threshold reynolds numbers obtained from the present model agree well with the results in gazzola et al 2012 5 results of the parametric study this paper focuses on the regular periodic state of the fluid structure interaction between the master and the slave cylinders coupled with the surrounding fluid it has been found that all the cases investigated here by eventually reach such a steady state after a sufficiently long time in the steady state the dominant vibration frequency of the slave cylinder is either equal to that of the master cylinder or sometimes integer times of that of the master cylinder in all the studied cases the slave master cylinders are always separated by the fluid with no occurrence of solid solid contact regarding the data analysis the emphasis is mainly placed on the displacement of and the force upon the slave cylinder and their relationships with the four non dimensional groups i e a 1 d g d f 1 f n and m for some representative cases the velocity fields and pressure distributions are also scrutinised and discussed to further investigate the relationship between f 1 and f 2 as well as the resonance behaviour of the slave cylinder fast fourier transform fft is used to examine the variations of the displacement and force in the frequency domain facilitated by the fft multiple frequency components blended in the time histories are distinguished to ensure the accuracy of the fft analysis at least 50 periods of steady state periodical vibrations are used in the transform zero padding is also applied during the transform which although adds some noise to the low amplitude regime in the frequency domain greatly increases the accuracy while extracting the peak amplitude 5 1 slave cylinder s displacement and force each of the non dimensional parameters is found to affect slave cylinder displacement amplitude a 2 d to some extent this section discusses the effect of each parameter in detail first of all we examine the effect of the master cylinder s frequency f 1 f n on the slave cylinder s oscillation amplitude a 2 d f 1 f n is considered to be the most influential parameter for a 2 d the resonance of the slave cylinder occurs at f 1 f n f w f n m m c a where c a is the added mass coefficient of the slave cylinder i e the added mass divided by the displaced fluid mass by the cylinder and f w is the immersed natural frequency of the slave cylinder in water fig 6 demonstrates the relationship between the master vibration amplitude a 1 d and the slave cylinder vibration amplitude a 2 d it can be seen that a 1 d generally follows a linear relationship with a 2 d except near the two resonance peaks other non dimensional parameters have a much smaller influence on this a 1 a 2 relationship than the f 1 f n the slave cylinder s relative amplitude a 2 a 1 at resonance decreases with the master oscillation amplitude a 2 d the major resonance peak occurs at the immersed natural frequency f 1 f n 0 775 f w f n m m c a assuming c a 1 whereas another minor peak of a 2 d takes place at half the immersed natural frequency f 1 f n 0 375 0 5 f w f n the reason for the existence of a minor peak will be discussed later in fig 7 the displacement amplitude spectra show that the vibration history of the slave cylinder in each case typically contains three distinct frequency components the corresponding frequency for each frequency components is equal to one two or three times f 1 f n i e f f n n f 1 f n n 1 2 3 as a result when the master vibrates at a frequency with f 1 f n f w f n n n 1 2 3 one of the frequency components of the slave cylinder displacement thus reaches the immersed natural frequency as f f n n f 1 f n n f w f n n f w f n n 1 2 3 since f f n f w f n resonance then occurs at that particular frequency component and yields a significant increase in the amplitude of that frequency component for example fig 7a fig 7b and fig 7c show the close up of the amplitude spectra at f 1 f n f w 3 f n f 1 f n f w 2 f n and f 1 f n f w f n respectively at f 1 f n 0 25 f w 3 f n we observe three rows of noticeable frequency components in fig 7a these rows from the furthest to the nearest row correspond to the components with f f n f 1 f n f f n 2 f 1 f n and f f n 3 f 1 f n overall the furthest row of f f n f 1 f n has the largest amplitude the middle row of f f n 2 f 1 f n has the second largest values of the amplitude the nearest row of f f n 3 f 1 f n has the smallest values of the amplitude in fig 7a the amplitude values of the frequency components f f n f w 3 f n reach their maximum at f 1 f n 0 25 f w 3 f n as seen in the red dashed rectangle of fig 7a similarly in fig 7b we observe two rows of frequency components i e f f n f 1 f n f f n 2 f 1 f n the amplitude values of the components with f f n 2 f 1 f n peak at f 1 f n 0 375 f w 2 f n as seen in the red dashed rectangle of fig 7b here the amplitude values of the components on the middle row also exceeds that of the furthest row this results in the minor peak found in fig 6 in fig 7c we identify only one row of the frequency components f f n f 1 f n whose values of amplitude reaches maximum at the immersed natural frequency f 1 f n 0 75 this constitutes the major resonance peak in fig 6 fig 7d provides an overview of the fft spectra the red dashed line denotes the dominant frequency in each case it is clear that the dominant frequency is equal to f 1 f n except at f 1 f n 0 375 f w 2 f n where the minor resonance is observed although the above analysis is for a specific case with f 1 f n being the only variable all other cases simulated with various a 1 d g d f 1 f n m follow almost the same pattern the variation of force upon the slave cylinder c y 2 with f 1 f n generally follows the same pattern as the displacement except at 0 95 f 1 f n 1 1 in this range the displacement amplitude spectra only have one row of noticeable components for f f n f 1 f n as shown in fig 8 a and their amplitude decreases steadily with the master frequency f 1 f n in contrast at the same range of 0 95 f 1 f n 1 1 two rows of distinct frequency components i e f f n f 1 f n and f f n 2 f 1 f n are found in the force amplitude spectra shown in fig 8b at f 1 f n 1 the amplitude of the further row with f f n f 1 f n reaches its minimum and becomes much smaller than the nearer row meanwhile the amplitude of nearest row f 2 f 1 increases slightly with f 1 f n it can be seen that a discrepancy between the dominant frequencies of y 2 and c y 2 is discovered at 0 99 f 1 f n 1 01 which is demonstrated by the red dashed lines tracking the dominant frequencies at 0 99 f 1 f n 1 01 this discrepancy exists because in the present study we consider only the undamped i e ζ 0 cases which means the initial conditions of this problem can affect displacement frequency of slave cylinder in addition to the frequency of the external force induced by the fluid this displacement force pattern discrepancy indicates that the initial conditions dominantly control the displacement amplitude at 0 99 f 1 f n 1 01 and the external force almost has no contribution to the slave cylinder displacement in other words at 0 99 f 1 f n 1 01 the displacement amplitude in the steady state is determined when the initial unsteady master slave interaction is finished and the steady periodical state starts this further implies that the external force upon the slave cylinder sharply decreases before reaching the steady state because the external force upon the slave cylinder is very small during the steady state simulation results also show that both the external force and displacement amplitude decrease during the initial unsteady state at this range conversely when resonance occurs at f 1 f n 0 74 f w f n the external force and the displacement amplitude increase in the initial unsteady state and the slave cylinder vibration in the subsequent steady state is dominantly controlled by a large c y 2 a in summary when the mass spring system of the slave cylinder is undamped and the slave cylinder oscillation reaches a steady state the displacement amplitude will be controlled by both the periodic force acting on the slave cylinder and the initial conditions regarding the steady state interaction determined by the initial unsteady interaction another important parameter is the mass ratio m i e the mass of the slave cylinder divided by that of the displaced water as seen in fig 9 a the mass ratio influences the natural frequency of the slave cylinder in fluid as f w f n m m c a this submerged natural frequency is approximately equal to the master frequency that causes the resonance of the slave cylinder therefore the resonance frequency increases with m m appears to have no effect on the resonance amplitude as a result the increase of m causes the peak in fig 9a to move rightwards it is also interesting to note that the curves with various m converges at the point a 2 a 1 f 1 f n 1 0 36 as seen in the dashed rectangle in fig 9a this convergence point is independent of a 1 d because a 2 d is linearly correlated with a 1 d at f 1 f n 1 as seen in fig 6 this convergence point is only affected by g d in other words if f 1 f n 1 a 2 a 1 is solely dependent on g d if we assume c a 1 the calculated m m c a does not exactly match the resonance frequency f w f n found in the simulations there is always a discrepancy of the magnitude of 10 2 conversely if we calculate the added mass coefficient as c a m 1 f p e a k f n 2 where f p e a k is the resonance frequency obtained directly from the simulations the c a can be found to be in the range of 0 70 0 85 for m 1 5 2 5 the calculated c a increases with m g d as well as with a 1 d in terms of the initial clear gap distance g d the slave cylinder vibration amplitude a 2 d decreases with the gap ratio g d as shown in fig 9b at a low frequency of the master cylinder oscillation f 1 f n 0 6 g d barely affects a 2 d whereas at the resonance frequency g d has a greater impact on a 2 d at a high frequency f 1 f n 1 0 g d has an insignificant impact on the slave cylinder amplitude compared with that at a low master frequency f 1 f n 0 6 5 2 phase difference between the slave and the master cylinders the phase difference is defined as the vibration phase of the slave cylinder minus that of the master cylinder i e δ ϕ 21 ϕ 2 ϕ 1 where the phases of the slave and the master are obtained through fft the phase difference is dominantly controlled by the master vibration frequency f 1 f n as seen in fig 10 we observe a 180 phase jump for δ ϕ 21 at the immersed natural frequency below which the two cylinders vibrate in antiphase i e δ ϕ 21 180 and above which they vibrate in phase i e δ ϕ 21 0 the phase jump frequency is equal to the resonance frequency and the resonance occurs when δ ϕ 21 90 the phase difference is not sensitive to other parameters δ ϕ 21 decreases slightly with master vibration amplitude ratio a 1 d at low master frequency f 1 f n and the impact of a 1 d diminishes with f 1 f n demonstrated as the converged curves in fig 10a regarding the mass ratio since phase jump frequency is equal to the resonance frequency m determines at which f 1 f n the vibration of the two cylinders changes from being in phase to being antiphase as seen in fig 10b this finding is in line with the amplitude results in section 5 1 the gap ratio g d does not affect much the phase difference as shown in fig 10c which means the distance between the two cylinders can hardly influence the slave master vibration phase difference 5 3 typical flow fields the velocity field and the pressure distribution are plotted to illustrate the mechanism of the cylinder fluid interaction in general no vortex shedding is identified and the flow is laminar and symmetrical which reflects the feature of the regime a for single cylinder vibration there are two types of hydrodynamic forces upon the cylinder surface i e shear and pressure forces in the present study the pressure force always has an amplitude larger than shear force so the pressure force is the dominant contributor to the motion of the slave cylinder therefore pressure contours are used to visualise the pressure distribution around the cylinders for comparison purposes in different configurations corresponding figures are with the same phase of the master cylinder s vibration ϕ 1 ϕ 1 0 is defined as the moment when the master cylinder at its highest position in the following discussion the default condition is g d 0 4 a 1 d 0 075 and m 1 5 we examine the flow fields at different values of f 1 f n because f 1 f n has a dominant effect on the flow field for both the master and the slave cylinders vortices are generated on two sides of the cylinder at every f 1 f n but the vortices are dissipated before they can detach from the surface this vortex generation dissipation process occurs twice in each cycle of the vibration fig 11 shows two typical flow patterns observed at f 1 f n 0 74 and f 1 f n 1 0 respectively at f 1 f n 0 74 we observe the first type of the flow pattern as seen in fig 11a when the slave cylinder moves downwards the fluid is still moving upwards due to the previous upward motion of slave cylinder this creates a vortex that moves outwards as well as upwards relative to the slave cylinder the vortex grows larger as it moves out but eventually the streamlines can no longer be closed and thus the vortex is dissipated this process can be affected by f 1 f n at f 1 f n 0 74 the resonance occurs and the relative amplitude is large i e a 2 a 1 1 7 this means that the slave cylinder vibration amplitude is much larger than that for the master and the flow field close to the slave cylinder is dominantly controlled by the slave itself consequently the velocity vector field near the slave cylinder looks very similar to a single cylinder vibrating in still fluid in contrast at f 1 f n 1 00 we see the second type of the flow pattern as demonstrated in fig 11b since the slave amplitude is much smaller than that for the master as a 2 a 1 0 25 the flow around the slave cylinder is greatly influenced by the master which results in a unique flow pattern a zero velocity point can be seen close to the vortex at the coordinate of about 0 58 0 57 the fluid below that point has been dragged down due to the downward motion of the master cylinder while the fluid above is still moving up due to inertia forming a vortex smaller and weaker than that at f 1 f n 0 74 it is also interesting that the position of the zero velocity point is relatively stable throughout the entire cycle if higher f 1 f n is applied the zero velocity point appears upwards in fig 12 at f 1 f n 1 00 when the slave cylinder has reached its highest or lowest position i e ϕ 1 0 or 180 a pair of vortices appears below the slave cylinder this is because the master and the slave cylinders move in phase and the upward motion of the slave cylinder causes the fluid to flow down along its surface and to collide with the fluid pushed up by the master cylinder the two flows with opposite directions collide and therefore a pair of vortices are generated conversely if the master and the slave cylinders are both moving downward reaching their lowest positions a pair of vortices with opposite vorticity is produced at f 1 f n 0 74 a moving zero velocity point is found in the gap and on the boundary dividing the fluids flowing upwards and the fluids going downwards as seen in fig 13 this point is found to travel downward from the bottom of the slave cylinder to the top of the master cylinder only which occurs twice in each cycle at f 1 f n 0 74 the slave master phase difference is δ ϕ 21 90 therefore for every 90 the slave and the master cylinders switch between moving in the same direction and in the opposite direction for example in fig 13 the zero velocity point appears when the slave and the master cylinders are moving in opposite directions i e towards each other or away from each other and that point travels only from the slave to the master cylinder this is because a 2 is larger than a 1 i e a 2 a 1 1 7 and thus the slave cylinder has a larger maximum velocity at 90 ϕ 1 180 the slave cylinder is accelerating to its maximum upwards velocity while the master cylinder is decelerating to zero velocity and moving downwards to its lowest position the slave cylinder thus drives its surrounding fluid upwards reversing the flow direction from the previous downwards movement here a zero velocity point appears as this process carries on more and more fluids are dragged upwards by the slave cylinder and the boundary thus continues to move downwards consequently the zero velocity point moves downwards as well which eventually touches the near side surface of the master cylinder at that moment the master velocity reaches zero and the zero velocity point disappears conversely when the slave and the master cylinders move towards each other the same process repeats although the fluid in the gap changes from flowing upwards to going downwards as the zero velocity point travels fig 14 depicts the contours of non dimensional pressure and the streamlines around the cylinders at f 1 f n 0 55 i e figs 14a 14d since a 2 d and f 1 f n are both low the fluid is less disturbed and thus its pressure contours have much less fluctuation compared with that at f 1 f n 0 74 1 00 at f 1 f n 0 55 since the relative amplitude of the slave cylinder is a 2 a 1 0 25 the master cylinder has more control over the pressure distribution compared with the slave cylinder the master and the slave cylinders vibrate in antiphase and thus always move in opposite directions as a result the streamlines do not connect the master and the slave directly through the gap at f 1 f n 0 74 ϕ 1 90 depicted in fig 14f when two cylinders move close to each other the fluid is pushed out of the gap and continues to flow due to inertia and the pressure in the gap gradually becomes negative when two cylinders move away from each other the fluid flows back to fill the gap where the pressure is increased since δ ϕ 21 90 673 the two cylinders switch periodically from moving in the same direction to moving in the opposite direction which causes a unique pressure distribution as demonstrated in figs 14e 14h correspondingly the distribution of streamlines switches periodically from connecting the cylinders directly e g fig 14f to not being so e g fig 14g at f 1 f n 1 00 i e figs 14i 14l the two cylinders vibrate in phase and a 2 a 1 0 25 as a result the pressure distribution is mainly controlled by the master cylinder while the slave cylinder only has a minor contribution there are always streamlines directly connecting the two cylinders because they vibrate in phase despite the identical phase ϕ 1 and amplitude a 1 d of the master the pressure contours at f 1 f n 0 74 and that at f 1 f n 1 0 as seen in figs 14f and 14j are drastically different because the phase of the slave cylinder at f 1 f n 1 0 is 90 lagged behind that at f 1 f n 0 74 in other words the pressure distribution on the surface of the slave cylinder is greatly influenced by the motion of the slave cylinder itself the pressure contours caused by the master and the slave cylinders interfere each other for example at f 1 f n 1 00 and ϕ 1 0 i e fig 14i the two cylinders vibrate in phase and both reach their highest positions with their velocities decelerating to zero since the master cylinder has a much larger amplitude than the salve and they vibrate in phase the pressure distribution is dominantly controlled by the master cylinder for the same reason the motion of the slave cylinder and the friction on its surface only slightly affects the distribution of the negative pressure and do not affect on the distribution at the far side of the master cylinder some low pressure areas are attached to the left and right surfaces of the master or the slave cylinders the vortices can be identified by the closed streamlines on the two sides of the cylinders for example for f 1 f n 1 00 at ϕ 1 90 and ϕ 1 270 i e figs 14j and 14l the negative pressure dashed lines attached to the shoulders of the master cylinder corresponds to the vortices in fig 11 these vortices can also be identified by the streamlines in figs 14j and 14l in summary although the slave cylinder is driven by the disturbed fluid around it it also feeds back to the flow and changes the surrounding pressure distribution when the slave cylinder is free to move as in the past studies its existence does not influence the disturbed flow much and the flow pattern is similar to that of a single cylinder oscillating in a still fluid when the slave cylinder has a different density from the fluid and is elastically mounted its influence on the disturbed flow can be significant therefore the coupling between the master and slave cylinders is more complex 6 conclusions we conducted detailed numerical simulations to investigate the mechanical interactions between two submerged cylinders the active cylinder undergoes forced vibration with specified amplitude and frequency all the simulations are at a constant reynolds number of 100 with a mass ratio ranging from 1 5 to 2 5 gap ratio ranging from 0 2 to 1 0 non dimensional vibration amplitude of the master cylinder ranging from 0 025 to 0 1 and non dimensional vibration frequency of the master cylinder ranging from 0 05 to 2 4 with considered ranges of parameters all the interactions reach a periodic steady state after a few cycles the present study considers only the characteristics of the interaction during the steady state f 1 f n is found to play a major role in governing a 2 d and δ ϕ 21 the slave cylinder s frequency domain is characterised by two types of frequency components the first type is the integer multiples of the master s vibration frequency and the magnitude of these harmonics is related to the hydrodynamic force acting on the slave cylinder the second is the structural natural frequency f n of the slave cylinder which is determined by the slave cylinder s mass and spring stiffness because of the undamped mounting of the slave cylinder the frequency component that reflects its natural frequency will persist rather than gradually die out when n f 1 f n f w f n n 1 2 3 resonance occurs at the corresponding frequency component this explains the secondary resonance occurring at f 1 f n f w f n 2 which takes place at the secondary frequency component f f n 2 f 1 f n a 1 is linearly correlated with a 2 except when resonance occurs m determines the values of f w f n and thus controls the exact frequency for the resonance f 1 f n a 2 d decreases with g d the pattern of the force upon the slave cylinder is very similar to the pattern of the displacement however at 0 99 f 1 f n 1 01 the dominant frequencies of the external force and the displacement are distinctively different owing to the undamped configuration of the slave cylinder which disallows the initial influence to disappear as f 1 f n increases from 0 05 to 2 4 the phase difference δ ϕ 21 between the slave and the master cylinders observes a 180 change from being antiphase to being in phase and the phase shift occurs abruptly at around f 1 f n f w f n at δ ϕ 21 90 the slave cylinder s vibration amplitude a 2 d reaches its maximum small vortices are generated on the left and right shoulders of the two cylinders but no vortex shedding takes place which is in line with the flow features in regime a tatsuno and bearman 1990 the variations in δ ϕ 21 and a 2 a 1 are also reflected in the changes in pressure distributions this study assumes the mass spring system to be undamped however in actual engineering applications a vibrating structure is almost certainly mounted with dampers and the damping ratio can significantly affect the dynamic response of the cylinder in the future the scenarios involving the damping effect will be considered more simulations with a three dimensional numerical model will be conducted with higher values of k c and β to reveal a more

23412,this study investigates the interaction between two cylinders of an identical diameter immersed in still fluid the master cylinder is subject to forced vibration while the adjacent slave cylinder is elastically mounted and has only one degree of freedom along the centreline of the two cylinders the hydrodynamic interaction is simulated with an extensively validated 2d navier stokes solver that is based on the finite element method and the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian method extensive simulations are conducted with a fixed reynolds number of 100 the initial clearance distance normalised by the cylinder diameter ranges from 0 2 to 1 0 the mass ratio of the cylinder over the displaced fluid ranges from 1 5 to 2 5 the vibrating amplitude of the master cylinder normalised by the cylinder diameter varies from 0 025 to 0 1 frequencies of the master s vibration normalised by the slave s structural natural frequency ranges from 0 05 to 2 4 when the frequency of the master cylinder reaches the immersed natural frequency of the slave cylinder the slave cylinder s vibration observes resonance and the phase difference between the two cylinders movement experiences a 180 shift in resonance the slave master phase difference is about 90 the frequency of the vibration is found to significantly affect the flow features keywords flow around circular cylinders flow induced vibration resonance computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction flow mediated interactions can be found in various natural and engineering contexts objects moving in a fluid can interact with the neighbouring objects through the disturbed fluid between them the subsequent motion of the neighbouring objects is of greater complexity than that of the objects subjected to a prescribed moving fluid

potential to be exploited in engineering applications e g vortex induced vibration energy harvesters bernitsas et al 2008 and self propulsion devices van rees et al 2015 relevant to the flow mediated interactions between circular cylinders numerous studies have been conducted over the past decades to investigate the fluid structure interactions containing only a single oscillating cylinder despite the simple geometry this problem involves a rich spectrum of physics and carries practical implications in ocean engineering and oil and gas industry particularly for the risers of the deep sea oil drilling platforms for a circular cylinder immersed in a fluid oscillating sinusoidally a scenario can be determined by two independent parameters i e the keulegan carpenter number and reynolds number the keulegan carpenter number can be defined as k c u m t d where u m is the amplitude of the oscillatory flow velocity t the period of oscillatory flow and d the diameter of the cylinder the reynolds number is defined as r e m u m d ν where ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity williamson 1985 carried out experiments to examine how the forces upon an oscillating cylinder are related to the vortex shedding he found that the number of vortex pairs shed from the cylinder per flow cycle increases with k c based on this pattern five flow regimes were identified tatsuno and bearman 1990 further investigated the flow features and found eight flow regimes based on flow visualization i e regimes a a b c d e f g in most of these flow regimes the three dimensional 3d flow was noticed only regimes a and a turned out to be two dimensional 2d in the present study the vibration of both cylinders is well within regime a which is characterized by the 2d and symmetrical flows based on the regimes categorised by tatsuno and bearman 1990 elston et al 2006 identified two fundamentally different types of symmetry breaking instability in the single cylinder oscillation case one is 2d instability and the other is 3d instability dütsch et al 1998 conducted laser doppler anemometry lda measurements and numerical simulations of a laminar flow induced by the harmonic oscillation of a circular cylinder in otherwise still water reporting reliable agreement between numerical and experimental results by comparing with these experimental results lin et al 2017 validated an in house 2d navier stokes model that is the basis of the present study zhao and cheng 2014 numerically studied the oscillatory flow past two circular cylinders they found that in the side by side arrangement with small gap ratios the vortex shedding from the gap of the two cylinders dominates resulting in the unique gap vortex shedding gvs regime which cannot be found for a single cylinder case in the tandem arrangement with a very small gap between the two cylinders the flow regimes are similar to that of a single cylinder a strong interaction between the vortex shedding flows from the two cylinders makes the flow notably irregular at large kc values in both side by side and tandem arrangements in contrast to the abundant research on the cylinders vibrating in a still fluid the research on the flow mediated interaction between multiple immersed cylinders is relatively rare lamb 1932 investigated the interaction between two spheres submerged in inviscid fluid one sphere is forced to oscillate along the centre line whereas the other nearby sphere of neutral buoyancy responds freely to the disturbed fluid by theoretical analysis lamb 1932 found that the free sphere is on the whole attracted towards the oscillating sphere due to the imbalanced pressure force by both analytical and numerical methods nair and kanso 2007 investigated an identical configuration in greater detail but for the case of two cylinders rather than two spheres one cylinder is started impulsively and is forced to oscillate along the centre line between two cylinders whereas the second responds freely nair and kanso 2007 found that depending on the initial phase i e initial velocity direction of the oscillation the free cylinder can be either repelled away or attracted towards the oscillating cylinder they further suggested that this should also be true for the spheres considered by lamb 1932 whose analysis only captured the attraction the flow mediated interaction between two cylinders was further studied by gazzola et al 2012 but the fluid was taken to be viscous rather than an inviscid gazzola et al 2012 discovered the threshold reynolds number beyond which the slave or passive cylinder is repelled by the master or active cylinder and under which it is attracted to the master cylinder a secondary flow structure is discovered between the two cylinders an increase in reynolds number i e a decrease in viscosity slows down the dissipation of the secondary flow which favours the repulsion of the slave cylinder by the master they further discovered that the threshold reynolds number is not affected by the initial phase of the master i e the phase of the initial impulsive vibration of the master cylinder this conclusion is different from that drawn in nair and kanso 2007 for the inviscid flow scenario where the repulsion or attraction is found to be governed by the initial phase of the movement the threshold reynolds number decreases exponentially with the increase in the initial gap whereas it is not substantially affected by the size difference between the two cylinders based on these observations gazzola et al 2012 concluded that the flow features have a greater influence than the inertia of the slave cylinder therefore in the present study the diameters of the slave and the master cylinders are configured to be the same gazzola et al 2012 also found that given a very small vibration amplitude of the master cylinder the level of repulsion or attraction is significantly reduced in summary there has not been sufficient research on the flow mediated interaction between immersed objects and the existing limited research all considers the case where the slave object has the same density as the mediated fluid and is completely free to move under the unbalanced hydrodynamic force however in actual engineering applications a vibrating structure is often of a different density from the fluid and is almost certainly elastically mounted 2 problem setup and numerical method in this study two identical rigid cylinders are placed in otherwise still fluid as seen in fig 1 at time zero the master cylinder starts to vibrate harmonically to disturb the fluid whereas the slave cylinder which has 1 degree of freedom 1dof in the y direction vibrates correspondingly under the action of the imbalanced hydrodynamic force the two cylinders are initially separated by a gap of g the non dimensional analysis shows that it requires five non dimensional parameters to define the problem i e gap ratio g d frequency of the master cylinder a 1 d amplitude of the master cylinder a 1 d the mass ratio of the slave cylinder m m c m d i s and reynolds number based on the maximum velocity of the master cylinder r e m 2 π a 1 f 1 d ν here f 1 is the vibration frequency of the master cylinder f n 1 2 π k m c is the structural natural frequency of the slave cylinder in vacuum k is the stiffness of the spring m c the mass of the slave cylinder m d i s the mass of the fluid displaced by the slave cylinder and ν the kinematic viscosity simulations are conducted for a range of combinations of parameters but the reynolds number is maintained constant as r e m 100 in summary the master cylinder s frequency f 1 d ranges from 0 05 to 2 4 the amplitude of the master cylinder takes a 1 d of 0 025 0 050 0 075 or 0 1 the mass ratio m takes the value of 1 5 1 7 2 0 2 2 or 2 5 the gap ratio g d varies from 0 2 to 1 0 with an increment of 0 1 in total 7448 combinations of parameters are examined the reynolds number r e m is fixed at 100 to limit the complexity of the studied problem and ensure the physical relevance of the present dns results the tested frequency of the master cylinder s vibration f 1 f n ranges from 0 05 to 2 4 which covers all the resonating frequencies of the slave cylinder s response as will be explained in section 5 1 the amplitude of the master cylinder a 1 d varies from 0 025 to 0 1 with the given r e m 100 the keulegan carpenter numbers and the stokes numbers of the master cylinder can then be calculated to be k c 2 π a 1 d 0 157 0 628 and β r e m k c 159 637 respectively hence the flow considered in this study is well within regime a which is symmetrical two dimensional flow without any vortex shedding as described in tatsuno and bearman 1990 these selections of parameters ensure the validity of the 2d navier stokes simulations if the master cylinder s oscillation amplitude a 1 d is too large the flow regime will no longer be a and the slave cylinder s response may undergo bifurcations to become unstable which is beyond the scope of the present analyses the tested mass ratio m varies from 1 5 1 7 2 0 2 2 to 2 5 these low mass ratios are typical for engineering structures immersed in water e g the mass ratio of concrete in water is about 2 5 the initial gap ratio g d ranges from 0 2 to 1 0 at g d 0 2 collision may occur and complicate the numerical study whereas at g d 1 0 the master slave interaction becomes weak and trivial the two dimensional navier stokes equations are solved by the petrov galerkin finite element method pg fem the moving cylinder boundaries are handled through the use of an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale scheme in the governing equations the length time velocity and pressure are non dimensional quantities according to 1 x i x i d t f n t u i u i f n d p p ρ

stiffness as explained before u i is the fluid velocity component in the x i direction and p is the pressure the variables with stars represent the non dimensional quantities the non dimensional incompressible two dimensional navier stokes equations in the ale framework are 2 u i x i 0 3 u i t u j u j m e s h u j x j p x i u m r e m f n d 2 u i x j x j where u j m e s h is the velocity of the

the slave cylinder and f y 2 is the force acting on the slave cylinder in the y direction 3 mesh independence study a close up of the computational mesh around the cylinders is illustrated in fig 2 a with g d 0 2 as an example it has 16 407 nodes in total the complete computational domain is of a square shape with the side length of 30 d which has been shown zhao and cheng 2014 to be sufficiently large to eliminate the boundary effects the mesh is a combination of structured around the cylinders and unstructured far from the cylinders types the number of elements along each cylinder circumference n c is 152 and the minimum non dimensional mesh size in the radial direction δ r is 1 30 10 3 the non dimensional time step δ t in the simulation is chosen based on the courant condition δ t 0 00025 u m 0 00025 d f n 2 π a 1 f 1 i e the courant number is δ t u m δ r 0 19 1 where u m is the non dimensional maximum vibration velocity of the master a mesh dependency study is conducted to ensure that the mesh is sufficiently dense to obtain converged results in this research the test case with g d 0 2 a 1 d 0 1 f 1 f n 0 825 ζ 0 and m 2 5 is chosen for the mesh dependency study this is a challenging case because of the large vibration amplitude of the slave cylinder which results in a very small distance between the two cylinder in a certain duration of a cycle the temporarily small proximity of the two cylinders adversely affects the accuracy of the computation as the computational cells in the gap are greatly squeezed and stretched periodically simulations are conducted in two scenarios scenario a has a constant n c 116 with δ r 2 65 10 4 3 22 10 4 4 49 10 4 6 36 10 4 9 21 10 4 1 38 10 3 2 21 10 3 3 87 10 3 and 2 43 10 2 in a series of meshes with different resolutions scenario b has constant δ r 9 10 4 while n c 62 80 98 116 134 152 170 188 206 224 242 260 and 278 in a series of meshes with different resolutions fig 3 a and fig 3b show the variations of a 2 d with δ r and n c respectively a 2 is calculated to be y m a x y m i n 2 where y m a x and y m i n are the maximum and minimum respectively of the y 2 values in the last 50 periods of steady oscillations it can be seen that the change in a 2 d is negligible when δ r 1 38 10 3 and n c 152 in conclusion a mesh with δ r 1 30 10 3 and n c 152 would be sufficiently fine to achieve converged results hence all the simulations adopted a resolution no coarser than this 4 model validation the numerical methods including the fem descretisation the solution of the vibration equation treatment of the moving boundary and adaptation of the mesh close to the boundary have all been validated in many previous studies zhao 2013 zhao and yan 2013 zhao et al 2013 cui et al 2014 zhao and cheng 2014 lin et al 2016 with regard to the present study we first consider a single cylinder oscillating harmonically in an otherwise still fluid at k c 5 r e m 100 to validate our numerical method the simulation is conducted on a mesh shown in fig 2b and the simulation results are compared with the experimental data obtained by dütsch et al 1998 as shown in fig 4 the horizontal and vertical components u v of the simulated and measured velocities are compared along four horizontal sections i e y d 0 6 0 0 6 and 1 2 at three phases i e ϕ 180 210 and 330 it can be seen that the simulation results match well with the experimental data in addition to the harmonic oscillation of a single cylinder we consider a case study that involves the interaction between two cylinders to validate the present numerical method in this case study the master cylinder is forced to oscillate along the centre line of the two cylinders whereas the slave cylinder is neutrally buoyant m 1 and is free to move in the fluid subject to unbalanced hydrodynamic force initially both cylinders are at rest and the master cylinder impulsively starts the oscillation by moving towards the slave cylinder the diameters of the two cylinders are identical while the master cylinder s vibration amplitude is fixed at a 1 d 1 0 the simulation results of the present numerical model are compared with that of gazzola et al 2012 who discovered the threshold reynolds numbers above which the slave cylinder is repelled away from the master and below which the slave cylinder is attracted towards the master the threshold reynolds number is shown to be a function of the initial distance between the two cylinders as seen in fig 5 a to illustrate how the threshold reynolds number is obtained from the present simulations the slave cylinder s displacements are plotted at a series of reynolds numbers in fig 5b the threshold reynolds numbers obtained from the present model agree well with the results in gazzola et al 2012 5 results of the parametric study this paper focuses on the regular periodic state of the fluid structure interaction between the master and the slave cylinders coupled with the surrounding fluid it has been found that all the cases investigated here by eventually reach such a steady state after a sufficiently long time in the steady state the dominant vibration frequency of the slave cylinder is either equal to that of the master cylinder or sometimes integer times of that of the master cylinder in all the studied cases the slave master cylinders are always separated by the fluid with no occurrence of solid solid contact regarding the data analysis the emphasis is mainly placed on the displacement of and the force upon the slave cylinder and their relationships with the four non dimensional groups i e a 1 d g d f 1 f n and m for some representative cases the velocity fields and pressure distributions are also scrutinised and discussed to further investigate the relationship between f 1 and f 2 as well as the resonance behaviour of the slave cylinder fast fourier transform fft is used to examine the variations of the displacement and force in the frequency domain facilitated by the fft multiple frequency components blended in the time histories are distinguished to ensure the accuracy of the fft analysis at least 50 periods of steady state periodical vibrations are used in the transform zero padding is also applied during the transform which although adds some noise to the low amplitude regime in the frequency domain greatly increases the accuracy while extracting the peak amplitude 5 1 slave cylinder s displacement and force each of the non dimensional parameters is found to affect slave cylinder displacement amplitude a 2 d to some extent this section discusses the effect of each parameter in detail first of all we examine the effect of the master cylinder s frequency f 1 f n on the slave cylinder s oscillation amplitude a 2 d f 1 f n is considered to be the most influential parameter for a 2 d the resonance of the slave cylinder occurs at f 1 f n f w f n m m c a where c a is the added mass coefficient of the slave cylinder i e the added mass divided by the displaced fluid mass by the cylinder and f w is the immersed natural frequency of the slave cylinder in water fig 6 demonstrates the relationship between the master vibration amplitude a 1 d and the slave cylinder vibration amplitude a 2 d it can be seen that a 1 d generally follows a linear relationship with a 2 d except near the two resonance peaks other non dimensional parameters have a much smaller influence on this a 1 a 2 relationship than the f 1 f n the slave cylinder s relative amplitude a 2 a 1 at resonance decreases with the master oscillation amplitude a 2 d the major resonance peak occurs at the immersed natural frequency f 1 f n 0 775 f w f n m m c a assuming c a 1 whereas another minor peak of a 2 d takes place at half the immersed natural frequency f 1 f n 0 375 0 5 f w f n the reason for the existence of a minor peak will be discussed later in fig 7 the displacement amplitude spectra show that the vibration history of the slave cylinder in each case typically contains three distinct frequency components the corresponding frequency for each frequency components is equal to one two or three times f 1 f n i e f f n n f 1 f n n 1 2 3 as a result when the master vibrates at a frequency with f 1 f n f w f n n n 1 2 3 one of the frequency components of the slave cylinder displacement thus reaches the immersed natural frequency as f f n n f 1 f n n f w f n n f w f n n 1 2 3 since f f n f w f n resonance then occurs at that particular frequency component and yields a significant increase in the amplitude of that frequency component for example fig 7a fig 7b and fig 7c show the close up of the amplitude spectra at f 1 f n f w 3 f n f 1 f n f w 2 f n and f 1 f n f w f n respectively at f 1 f n 0 25 f w 3 f n we observe three rows of noticeable frequency components in fig 7a these rows from the furthest to the nearest row correspond to the components with f f n f 1 f n f f n 2 f 1 f n and f f n 3 f 1 f n overall the furthest row of f f n f 1 f n has the largest amplitude the middle row of f f n 2 f 1 f n has the second largest values of the amplitude the nearest row of f f n 3 f 1 f n has the smallest values of the amplitude in fig 7a the amplitude values of the frequency components f f n f w 3 f n reach their maximum at f 1 f n 0 25 f w 3 f n as seen in the red dashed rectangle of fig 7a similarly in fig 7b we observe two rows of frequency components i e f f n f 1 f n f f n 2 f 1 f n the amplitude values of the components with f f n 2 f 1 f n peak at f 1 f n 0 375 f w 2 f n as seen in the red dashed rectangle of fig 7b here the amplitude values of the components on the middle row also exceeds that of the furthest row this results in the minor peak found in fig 6 in fig 7c we identify only one row of the frequency components f f n f 1 f n whose values of amplitude reaches maximum at the immersed natural frequency f 1 f n 0 75 this constitutes the major resonance peak in fig 6 fig 7d provides an overview of the fft spectra the red dashed line denotes the dominant frequency in each case it is clear that the dominant frequency is equal to f 1 f n except at f 1 f n 0 375 f w 2 f n where the minor resonance is observed although the above analysis is for a specific case with f 1 f n being the only variable all other cases simulated with various a 1 d g d f 1 f n m follow almost the same pattern the variation of force upon the slave cylinder c y 2 with f 1 f n generally follows the same pattern as the displacement except at 0 95 f 1 f n 1 1 in this range the displacement amplitude spectra only have one row of noticeable components for f f n f 1 f n as shown in fig 8 a and their amplitude decreases steadily with the master frequency f 1 f n in contrast at the same range of 0 95 f 1 f n 1 1 two rows of distinct frequency components i e f f n f 1 f n and f f n 2 f 1 f n are found in the force amplitude spectra shown in fig 8b at f 1 f n 1 the amplitude of the further row with f f n f 1 f n reaches its minimum and becomes much smaller than the nearer row meanwhile the amplitude of nearest row f 2 f 1 increases slightly with f 1 f n it can be seen that a discrepancy between the dominant frequencies of y 2 and c y 2 is discovered at 0 99 f 1 f n 1 01 which is demonstrated by the red dashed lines tracking the dominant frequencies at 0 99 f 1 f n 1 01 this discrepancy exists because in the present study we consider only the undamped i e ζ 0 cases which means the initial conditions of this problem can affect displacement frequency of slave cylinder in addition to the frequency of the external force induced by the fluid this displacement force pattern discrepancy indicates that the initial conditions dominantly control the displacement amplitude at 0 99 f 1 f n 1 01 and the external force almost has no contribution to the slave cylinder displacement in other words at 0 99 f 1 f n 1 01 the displacement amplitude in the steady state is determined when the initial unsteady master slave interaction is finished and the steady periodical state starts this further implies that the external force upon the slave cylinder sharply decreases before reaching the steady state because the external force upon the slave cylinder is very small during the steady state simulation results also show that both the external force and displacement amplitude decrease during the initial unsteady state at this range conversely when resonance occurs at f 1 f n 0 74 f w f n the external force and the displacement amplitude increase in the initial unsteady state and the slave cylinder vibration in the subsequent steady state is dominantly controlled by a large c y 2 a in summary when the mass spring system of the slave cylinder is undamped and the slave cylinder oscillation reaches a steady state the displacement amplitude will be controlled by both the periodic force acting on the slave cylinder and the initial conditions regarding the steady state interaction determined by the initial unsteady interaction another important parameter is the mass ratio m i e the mass of the slave cylinder divided by that of the displaced water as seen in fig 9 a the mass ratio influences the natural frequency of the slave cylinder in fluid as f w f n m m c a this submerged natural frequency is approximately equal to the master frequency that causes the resonance of the slave cylinder therefore the resonance frequency increases with m m appears to have no effect on the resonance amplitude as a result the increase of m causes the peak in fig 9a to move rightwards it is also interesting to note that the curves with various m converges at the point a 2 a 1 f 1 f n 1 0 36 as seen in the dashed rectangle in fig 9a this convergence point is independent of a 1 d because a 2 d is linearly correlated with a 1 d at f 1 f n 1 as seen in fig 6 this convergence point is only affected by g d in other words if f 1 f n 1 a 2 a 1 is solely dependent on g d if we assume c a 1 the calculated m m c a does not exactly match the resonance frequency f w f n found in the simulations there is always a discrepancy of the magnitude of 10 2 conversely if we calculate the added mass coefficient as c a m 1 f p e a k f n 2 where f p e a k is the resonance frequency obtained directly from the simulations the c a can be found to be in the range of 0 70 0 85 for m 1 5 2 5 the calculated c a increases with m g d as well as with a 1 d in terms of the initial clear gap distance g d the slave cylinder vibration amplitude a 2 d decreases with the gap ratio g d as shown in fig 9b at a low frequency of the master cylinder oscillation f 1 f n 0 6 g d barely affects a 2 d whereas at the resonance frequency g d has a greater impact on a 2 d at a high frequency f 1 f n 1 0 g d has an insignificant impact on the slave cylinder amplitude compared with that at a low master frequency f 1 f n 0 6 5 2 phase difference between the slave and the master cylinders the phase difference is defined as the vibration phase of the slave cylinder minus that of the master cylinder i e δ ϕ 21 ϕ 2 ϕ 1 where the phases of the slave and the master are obtained through fft the phase difference is dominantly controlled by the master vibration frequency f 1 f n as seen in fig 10 we observe a 180 phase jump for δ ϕ 21 at the immersed natural frequency below which the two cylinders vibrate in antiphase i e δ ϕ 21 180 and above which they vibrate in phase i e δ ϕ 21 0 the phase jump frequency is equal to the resonance frequency and the resonance occurs when δ ϕ 21 90 the phase difference is not sensitive to other parameters δ ϕ 21 decreases slightly with master vibration amplitude ratio a 1 d at low master frequency f 1 f n and the impact of a 1 d diminishes with f 1 f n demonstrated as the converged curves in fig 10a regarding the mass ratio since phase jump frequency is equal to the resonance frequency m determines at which f 1 f n the vibration of the two cylinders changes from being in phase to being antiphase as seen in fig 10b this finding is in line with the amplitude results in section 5 1 the gap ratio g d does not affect much the phase difference as shown in fig 10c which means the distance between the two cylinders can hardly influence the slave master vibration phase difference 5 3 typical flow fields the velocity field and the pressure distribution are plotted to illustrate the mechanism of the cylinder fluid interaction in general no vortex shedding is identified and the flow is laminar and symmetrical which reflects the feature of the regime a for single cylinder vibration there are two types of hydrodynamic forces upon the cylinder surface i e shear and pressure forces in the present study the pressure force always has an amplitude larger than shear force so the pressure force is the dominant contributor to the motion of the slave cylinder therefore pressure contours are used to visualise the pressure distribution around the cylinders for comparison purposes in different configurations corresponding figures are with the same phase of the master cylinder s vibration ϕ 1 ϕ 1 0 is defined as the moment when the master cylinder at its highest position in the following discussion the default condition is g d 0 4 a 1 d 0 075 and m 1 5 we examine the flow fields at different values of f 1 f n because f 1 f n has a dominant effect on the flow field for both the master and the slave cylinders vortices are generated on two sides of the cylinder at every f 1 f n but the vortices are dissipated before they can detach from the surface this vortex generation dissipation process occurs twice in each cycle of the vibration fig 11 shows two typical flow patterns observed at f 1 f n 0 74 and f 1 f n 1 0 respectively at f 1 f n 0 74 we observe the first type of the flow pattern as seen in fig 11a when the slave cylinder moves downwards the fluid is still moving upwards due to the previous upward motion of slave cylinder this creates a vortex that moves outwards as well as upwards relative to the slave cylinder the vortex grows larger as it moves out but eventually the streamlines can no longer be closed and thus the vortex is dissipated this process can be affected by f 1 f n at f 1 f n 0 74 the resonance occurs and the relative amplitude is large i e a 2 a 1 1 7 this means that the slave cylinder vibration amplitude is much larger than that for the master and the flow field close to the slave cylinder is dominantly controlled by the slave itself consequently the velocity vector field near the slave cylinder looks very similar to a single cylinder vibrating in still fluid in contrast at f 1 f n 1 00 we see the second type of the flow pattern as demonstrated in fig 11b since the slave amplitude is much smaller than that for the master as a 2 a 1 0 25 the flow around the slave cylinder is greatly influenced by the master which results in a unique flow pattern a zero velocity point can be seen close to the vortex at the coordinate of about 0 58 0 57 the fluid below that point has been dragged down due to the downward motion of the master cylinder while the fluid above is still moving up due to inertia forming a vortex smaller and weaker than that at f 1 f n 0 74 it is also interesting that the position of the zero velocity point is relatively stable throughout the entire cycle if higher f 1 f n is applied the zero velocity point appears upwards in fig 12 at f 1 f n 1 00 when the slave cylinder has reached its highest or lowest position i e ϕ 1 0 or 180 a pair of vortices appears below the slave cylinder this is because the master and the slave cylinders move in phase and the upward motion of the slave cylinder causes the fluid to flow down along its surface and to collide with the fluid pushed up by the master cylinder the two flows with opposite directions collide and therefore a pair of vortices are generated conversely if the master and the slave cylinders are both moving downward reaching their lowest positions a pair of vortices with opposite vorticity is produced at f 1 f n 0 74 a moving zero velocity point is found in the gap and on the boundary dividing the fluids flowing upwards and the fluids going downwards as seen in fig 13 this point is found to travel downward from the bottom of the slave cylinder to the top of the master cylinder only which occurs twice in each cycle at f 1 f n 0 74 the slave master phase difference is δ ϕ 21 90 therefore for every 90 the slave and the master cylinders switch between moving in the same direction and in the opposite direction for example in fig 13 the zero velocity point appears when the slave and the master cylinders are moving in opposite directions i e towards each other or away from each other and that point travels only from the slave to the master cylinder this is because a 2 is larger than a 1 i e a 2 a 1 1 7 and thus the slave cylinder has a larger maximum velocity at 90 ϕ 1 180 the slave cylinder is accelerating to its maximum upwards velocity while the master cylinder is decelerating to zero velocity and moving downwards to its lowest position the slave cylinder thus drives its surrounding fluid upwards reversing the flow direction from the previous downwards movement here a zero velocity point appears as this process carries on more and more fluids are dragged upwards by the slave cylinder and the boundary thus continues to move downwards consequently the zero velocity point moves downwards as well which eventually touches the near side surface of the master cylinder at that moment the master velocity reaches zero and the zero velocity point disappears conversely when the slave and the master cylinders move towards each other the same process repeats although the fluid in the gap changes from flowing upwards to going downwards as the zero velocity point travels fig 14 depicts the contours of non dimensional pressure and the streamlines around the cylinders at f 1 f n 0 55 i e figs 14a 14d since a 2 d and f 1 f n are both low the fluid is less disturbed and thus its pressure contours have much less fluctuation compared with that at f 1 f n 0 74 1 00 at f 1 f n 0 55 since the relative amplitude of the slave cylinder is a 2 a 1 0 25 the master cylinder has more control over the pressure distribution compared with the slave cylinder the master and the slave cylinders vibrate in antiphase and thus always move in opposite directions as a result the streamlines do not connect the master and the slave directly through the gap at f 1 f n 0 74 ϕ 1 90 depicted in fig 14f when two cylinders move close to each other the fluid is pushed out of the gap and continues to flow due to inertia and the pressure in the gap gradually becomes negative when two cylinders move away from each other the fluid flows back to fill the gap where the pressure is increased since δ ϕ 21 90 673 the two cylinders switch periodically from moving in the same direction to moving in the opposite direction which causes a unique pressure distribution as demonstrated in figs 14e 14h correspondingly the distribution of streamlines switches periodically from connecting the cylinders directly e g fig 14f to not being so e g fig 14g at f 1 f n 1 00 i e figs 14i 14l the two cylinders vibrate in phase and a 2 a 1 0 25 as a result the pressure distribution is mainly controlled by the master cylinder while the slave cylinder only has a minor contribution there are always streamlines directly connecting the two cylinders because they vibrate in phase despite the identical phase ϕ 1 and amplitude a 1 d of the master the pressure contours at f 1 f n 0 74 and that at f 1 f n 1 0 as seen in figs 14f and 14j are drastically different because the phase of the slave cylinder at f 1 f n 1 0 is 90 lagged behind that at f 1 f n 0 74 in other words the pressure distribution on the surface of the slave cylinder is greatly influenced by the motion of the slave cylinder itself the pressure contours caused by the master and the slave cylinders interfere each other for example at f 1 f n 1 00 and ϕ 1 0 i e fig 14i the two cylinders vibrate in phase and both reach their highest positions with their velocities decelerating to zero since the master cylinder has a much larger amplitude than the salve and they vibrate in phase the pressure distribution is dominantly controlled by the master cylinder for the same reason the motion of the slave cylinder and the friction on its surface only slightly affects the distribution of the negative pressure and do not affect on the distribution at the far side of the master cylinder some low pressure areas are attached to the left and right surfaces of the master or the slave cylinders the vortices can be identified by the closed streamlines on the two sides of the cylinders for example for f 1 f n 1 00 at ϕ 1 90 and ϕ 1 270 i e figs 14j and 14l the negative pressure dashed lines attached to the shoulders of the master cylinder corresponds to the vortices in fig 11 these vortices can also be identified by the streamlines in figs 14j and 14l in summary although the slave cylinder is driven by the disturbed fluid around it it also feeds back to the flow and changes the surrounding pressure distribution when the slave cylinder is free to move as in the past studies its existence does not influence the disturbed flow much and the flow pattern is similar to that of a single cylinder oscillating in a still fluid when the slave cylinder has a different density from the fluid and is elastically mounted its influence on the disturbed flow can be significant therefore the coupling between the master and slave cylinders is more complex 6 conclusions we conducted detailed numerical simulations to investigate the mechanical interactions between two submerged cylinders the active cylinder undergoes forced vibration with specified amplitude and frequency all the simulations are at a constant reynolds number of 100 with a mass ratio ranging from 1 5 to 2 5 gap ratio ranging from 0 2 to 1 0 non dimensional vibration amplitude of the master cylinder ranging from 0 025 to 0 1 and non dimensional vibration frequency of the master cylinder ranging from 0 05 to 2 4 with considered ranges of parameters all the interactions reach a periodic steady state after a few cycles the present study considers only the characteristics of the interaction during the steady state f 1 f n is found to play a major role in governing a 2 d and δ ϕ 21 the slave cylinder s frequency domain is characterised by two types of frequency components the first type is the integer multiples of the master s vibration frequency and the magnitude of these harmonics is related to the hydrodynamic force acting on the slave cylinder the second is the structural natural frequency f n of the slave cylinder which is determined by the slave cylinder s mass and spring stiffness because of the undamped mounting of the slave cylinder the frequency component that reflects its natural frequency will persist rather than gradually die out when n f 1 f n f w f n n 1 2 3 resonance occurs at the corresponding frequency component this explains the secondary resonance occurring at f 1 f n f w f n 2 which takes place at the secondary frequency component f f n 2 f 1 f n a 1 is linearly correlated with a 2 except when resonance occurs m determines the values of f w f n and thus controls the exact frequency for the resonance f 1 f n a 2 d decreases with g d the pattern of the force upon the slave cylinder is very similar to the pattern of the displacement however at 0 99 f 1 f n 1 01 the dominant frequencies of the external force and the displacement are distinctively different owing to the undamped configuration of the slave cylinder which disallows the initial influence to disappear as f 1 f n increases from 0 05 to 2 4 the phase difference δ ϕ 21 between the slave and the master cylinders observes a 180 change from being antiphase to being in phase and the phase shift occurs abruptly at around f 1 f n f w f n at δ ϕ 21 90 the slave cylinder s vibration amplitude a 2 d reaches its maximum small vortices are generated on the left and right shoulders of the two cylinders but no vortex shedding takes place which is in line with the flow features in regime a tatsuno and bearman 1990 the variations in δ ϕ 21 and a 2 a 1 are also reflected in the changes in pressure distributions this study assumes the mass spring system to be undamped however in actual engineering applications a vibrating structure is almost certainly mounted with dampers and the damping ratio can significantly affect the dynamic response of the cylinder in the future the scenarios involving the damping effect will be considered more simulations with a three dimensional numerical model will be conducted with higher values of k c and β to reveal a more

23413,in this paper an intelligent adaptive algorithm based on the integrated inertial navigation system ins is presented for estimating the velocity of an autonomous underwater vehicle auv the most common algorithm for incorporating the navigation data is kalman filter kf in the conventional kf algorithm the covariance matrix of measurement noise is considered as a constant through running time the noise covariance in the adaptive kalman filter akf is estimated through processing the innovation sequence inside a window of constant length in actual conditions the correct window length to achieve the best estimation depends on the operational conditions in this paper proper window length in the adaptive algorithm is estimated by processing the probability density function of the innovation sequence at each time step so the window length in the proposed algorithm is variable due to condition changes the proposed integrated navigation system consists of a three axis inertial measurement unit imu and a three axis doppler velocity log dvl the performance of the proposed system is evaluated through four sea tests using an auv experimental results show that the proposed system has superior performance than the conventional kf algorithm and is similar to the optimum akf akf with the best window length keywords doppler velocity log inertial navigation velocity estimation adaptive kalman filter 1 introduction various sensors and methods are used to achieve the speed of underwater vehicles using electromagnetic speed log eml model based methods and doppler velocity log dvl is common to measure and calculate the speed of underwater vehicles in the eml when sea water passes through an electromagnetic field a voltage is created and varies depending upon the speed of the water flow the eml measures the voltage and translates it into the vessel s speed through water there is a correlation between propeller rotation speed propeller torque and relative advance speed in water hence the propeller rotation speed can be used to roughly estimate vehicle relative advance speed allotta et al 2015a 2016b 2015b the eml and propeller model based methods provide the speed relative to water not ground while dvl calculates vehicle s velocity with respect to the sea bottom through emitting acoustic pulses toward seabed and measuring doppler shift of returned pulses with respect to the emitted ones gordon 1996 the dvl translates it into the vessel s speed over ground because of water speed using the relative speed in navigation causes a slight error and it is better to use speed over ground to achieve an accurate navigation accordingly dvl is a widely used sensor for measuring the velocity of underwater vehicles larsen 2000 grenon et al 2001 lee et al 2007 tang et al 2013 gao et al 2014 allotta et al 2016a emami and taban 2017 xu et al 2017 this sensor calculates vessel s speed over ground through emitting acoustic pulses toward seabed for this reason the accuracy of the measured velocity depends on environmental conditions such as depth kind of seabed and ambient acoustic noise sonnenberg 1988 farrell 2008 dvl s measurements are noisy and often contain outlier data hence using dvl individually may not be an appropriate way for accurate navigation a prevalent approach for estimating underwater vehicle s velocity is to integrate dvl s measurements with accelerometer s signals this method is used in the integrated inertial navigation system ins lee and jun 2007 miller et al 2010 hegrenaes and hallingstad 2011 li et al 2013 2015 shabani et al 2015 shabani and gholami 2016 chang et al 2017 kalman filter kf kalman 1960 is the most conventional algorithm for data integration in navigation applications brown and hwang 2012 grewal et al 2013 grewal and andrews 2015 in the kf algorithm the statistics of the filter expressed by the process and measurement noise matrices are considered constant mohamed 1999 these matrices are usually determined either through information presented by manufacturer or data analysis in stationary conditions farrell 2008 groves 2013 in actual conditions noise covariance matrix varies during navigation time variations in the noise covariance matrix of dvl s measurements may be significant due to dependence of dvl on environmental conditions this may cause destructive effects on estimation accuracy therefore estimation algorithm with constant noise covariance must be replaced with an adaptive estimation algorithm throughout the estimation process adaptive kalman filter akf was first proposed by mehra in 1970 where covariance matrices of process and measurement noises are estimated based on the variations of innovation sequence mehra 1970 1972 in navigation applications this algorithm was first used by mohamed and schwarz for estimating the noise covariance matrix in the integrated inertial navigation system global positioning system ins gps mohamed and schwarz 1999 the akf has been widely used in air and land vehicles ever since hide et al 2003 hu et al 2003 ding et al 2007 jwo and weng 2008 jiancheng and sheng 2011 regarding marine applications some studies have been conducted in the recent years for example gao and li have proposed a sage husa based akf for ins dvl navigation system gao and li 2013 gao et al have suggested an adaptive noise estimator for integrated ins dvl system gao et al 2015 recently davari et al have developed a multi rate akf for marine integrated navigation system davari et al 2016 in the conventional akf a fixed length window of innovation sequence is processed at every time instant and noise covariance is estimated inside this window gao et al 2015 the accuracy of innovation covariance matrix estimation depends on the window length system dynamic specifications vehicle manoeuvres and environmental factors may have a major impact on proper choice of this parameter mohamed and schwarz 1999 for example in ins dvl navigation under the conditions that vehicle motion has high frequency variations or outlier data in dvl s measurements occurs the window length must adopt a small value to be able to detect rapid changes nonetheless under the conditions that system dynamic changes mildly and the noise of dvl s measurement has steady distribution it is better to select a large value for window length to achieve a better estimate of innovation covariance matrix since operational conditions of the system are not predictable the variations of the dvl noise cannot be predicted therefore it is not possible to determine an optimal window length in this paper a novel intelligent integrated navigation system is presented in which the length of estimation window is adaptively tuned through detecting the noise distribution changes along the innovation vector time instants of the variations occurred in the measurement noise are detected in order to determine a proper value for window length window length is set to a small value at these time instants also the window length is set to a large value at time instants at which the variance of dvl noise is constant maximum value is selected such that the location of considerable variations in the noise does not lie inside the window results of the experimental tests performed at sea show that the proposed algorithm is a proper solution to remove the confusion of designer in determining the window length evaluation of the proposed algorithm has been done through an integrated navigation system composed of a three axis inertial measurement unit imu and a three axis dvl installed on an autonomous underwater vehicle auv in this paper since the used auv has mild dynamic the covariance matrix of process noise is assumed to be constant the structure of the paper is as follows after introduction the equations related to the integrated navigation system are given in section 2 in section 3 the equations of the proposed algorithm are derived in section 4 experimental results of the proposed system will be presented finally section 5 draws a conclusion of the paper 2 integrated navigation system in this section first system and measurement

follows 2 w w a t w g t t where w a w a x w a y w a z t and w g w g x w g y w g z t are the noise components of the accelerometer and gyroscope measurements because of independency between w a and w g

with the system states which are corrupted by noise the measurement model can be expressed by the following equation 13 v b h x υ v c b n 1 v n υ v where v b v x v y v z t is dvl measurement vector in the body frame υ v υ x υ y υ z t is the measurement noise vector modelled as an additive white gaussian noise with zero mean and covariance matrix r as 14 r σ x 2 0 0 0 σ y 2 0 0 0 σ z 2 where σ x 2 σ y 2 and σ z 2 are the variances of dvl measurements 2 3 data integration since the navigation system s kinematic equations are non linear in an ins dvl integrated navigation system it is not possible to use the linear kf so the extended kalman filter ekf is usually used for data integration in this system kf algorithm comprises two steps prediction step and correction step whose equations will be described as follows we have considered the system in discrete time form in which k denotes the present time t k 2 3 1 prediction step in the prediction section the total state of the system and its covariance matrix are predicted as follows sarkka 2013 15 x ˆ k t k 1 t k f x ˆ k 1 u k 1 0 d t 16 p k a k 1 p k 1 a k 1 t q k 1 here x ˆ k and x ˆ k are the predicted and the corrected estimations of

2 δ a m a x where ζ x k and ζ y k are filter innovation vectors in directions of x and y at time step k δ a m a x is the detection threshold of outlier data 3 proposed adaptive algorithm in the proposed algorithm the process noise covariance matrix is considered as a constant q c c t e and the measurement noise covariance matrix is estimated adaptively in the kf algorithm the innovation sequence at time step k is the difference between the real measurement received from the aiding sensor and corresponding predicted quantity as 27 ζ k v k b v ˆ k where ζ k ζ x k ζ y k ζ z k t v k b and v ˆ k are filter innovation vector dvl s measurement vector and predicted measurement vector at time step k respectively the measurement vector is predicted by measurement model function as follows 28 v ˆ k h x k and the measurement noise covariance matrix can be estimated as follows mehra 1970 29 r ˆ k c ˆ v k h k p k h k t note that by knowing the innovation sequence the innovation covariance matrix can be computed through averaging inside a window of length n as 30 c ˆ v k 1 n j j 0 k ζ j ζ j t where j 0 k n 1 is the first instant inside the estimation window according to fig 1 the akf has additional computations for estimating the matrices c ˆ v k and r ˆ k block diagram of an akf based integrated navigation system is also depicted in fig 2 in eq 30 window length is considered as a constant however in practice optimal value of this parameter changes due to change of measurement noise distribution caused by environmental conditions and sensor performance in order to solve this problem an intelligent approach for adaptively estimating the window length based on verification on measurement noise distribution is proposed to detect the change in the noise distribution of dvl s measurement at every time step a window of length 2 m named detection window is considered innovation sequence in the direction of x inside this window can be shown as ζ x k 2 m ζ x k m ζ x k 1 where ζ x k is the x component of the innovation sequence at time step k in normal conditions x component of dvl s measurement vector in the whole of detection window has a white gaussian noise with zero mean and variance σ x 2 therefore probability density function pdf of x component of innovation inside the detection window can be expressed as follows 31 p d f x ζ x k 1 2 π σ x 2 e ζ x k 2 2 σ x 2 ζ x k n 0 σ x 2 environmental conditions in the sea at different times and positions are always variable and whenever this happens changes in distribution of noise and outliers in the measurement of dvl occur if noise variance changes gradually its duration will be large compared to detection window in this case the noise pdf in detection window will be almost fixed therefore matrix c ˆ v k can be computed with acceptable approximation from eq 30 nonetheless if changes in pdf of noise happen so fast that two different pdfs exist eq 30 does not yield accurate estimation of the innovation covariance matrix hence it is required to detect the border of noise variation inside detection window in this case the data received before the recognized border must not be used to estimate the innovation covariance matrix corresponding to the times after the border in other words upon detecting the noise border estimation window length must be reset it is evident that between two noise borders an increase in the estimation window length results in improving the estimation accuracy of the covariance matrix therefore in the proposed algorithm estimation window length increases between two borders and is reset upon arriving the window to each border in order to detect noise border in our algorithm square of the innovation is processed for this purpose we shall express the cumulative distribution function cdf of the square of the innovation if w x k ζ x k 2 then cdf of the square of the innovation can be obtained as follows 32 c d f w x k w x k p w x k ζ x k w x k c d f x w x k c d f x w x k where w x k is square of innovation in the direction of x at time step k the pdf of w x k can be obtained by differentiating both sides of the eq 32 as follows 33 p d f w x k w x k 1 2 w x k p d f x w x k p d f x w x k 1 2 π σ x 2 w x k e w x k 2 σ x 2 the variance of dvl s measurement noise inside the detection window of length 2 m can be obtained by maximum likelihood ml estimation if sequence w x inside the detection window is shown as w x w x k 2 m w x k m w x k 1 since data of sequence w x are independent the pdf of the sequence w x equals the product of the individual sequence data 34 p d f w x w x n k 2 m k 1 1 2 π σ x 2 w x n e w x n 2 σ x 2 where w x w x k 2 m w x k m w x k 1 in order to compute the variance σ x 2 by using the ml estimation p d f w x w x or ln p d f w x w x must be maximized hence the variance σ x 2 can be calculated as follows 35 ln p d f w x w x 1 2 n k 2 m k 1 ln 2 π σ x 2 w x n w x n σ x 2 a x 36 σ x 2 a x 0 solution of the eq 36 yields the σ x 2 as follows 37 σ x 2 1 2 m n k 2 m k 1 w x n in order to detect the border of noise variation the middle point of the sliding detection window is checked at each time step if this point is the border of noise variation the pdf in the whole of detection window equals the product of the pdfs in two regions 38 p d f w x w x n k m k 1 1 2 π σ 1 2 w x n e w x n 2 σ 1 2 n k 2 m k m 1 1 2 π σ 2 2 w x n e w x n 2 σ 2 2 which the first region has a gaussian noise distribution with variance σ 1 2 and also the second one has a gaussian noise distribution with variance σ 2 2 these variances can be obtained by ml estimation as follows 39 σ 1 2 1 m n k m k 1 w x n 40 σ 2 2 1 m n k 2 m k m 1 w x n similar to eq 35 the pdf of the sequence w x can be obtained under the conditions of distribution noise variation as follows 41 ln p d f w x w x 1 2 n k m k 1 ln 2 π σ 1 2 w x n w x n σ 1 2 1 2 n k 2 m k m 1 ln 2 π σ 2 2 w x n w x n σ 2 2 b x other equations similar to 35 and 41 can also be obtained for the y direction existence of the noise border in the middle of detection window can be detected through values a x and b x if the border of the noise variation lies in the middle of the detection window the value b x will be greater than a x otherwise the value a x is greater than b x results of the experimental tests at sea show that the noise variation in the x and y axes occurs simultaneously therefore to detect this event the following condition relation is checked 42 b x a x b y a y t where t is a threshold value which is determined by the designer considering a large value for t may cause the noise border not to be detected conversely selecting a small value for t may cause slight variations in the noise variance to be recognized and consequently numerous borders to be detected results of the simulation and experimental tests show that t m is a proper choice therefore the condition expressed in eq 42 must be checked at each time step when this condition is satisfied noise variation is occurred and hereafter the data received prior to detected border are not used for estimating the innovation covariance matrix in this case the estimation of c ˆ v k is done by using a window of length n 2 if no variation in noise distribution is detected estimation window length will be increased linearly with time since increase in the estimation window length increases computational load a maximum value can be considered for it as a result adaptive tuning of estimation window length is expressed as follows 43 n k 2 if b x a x b y a y t or δ ζ x k 2 δ ζ y k 2 δ a m a x n k n k 1 1 otherwise according to eq 43 estimation window length is reset in two cases variation in noise variance or occurrence of drop out although the condition related to variation in noise variance also detects occurrence of drop out to a large extent utilizing the condition related to the occurrence of drop out in eq 43 individually makes the detection of border of noise variation more accurate it should be noted that the equations eq 35 and eq 41 can be simplified as follows 44 a x 1 2 2 m ln 2 π 2 m ln σ x 2 n k 2 m k 1 ln w x n 2 m 45 b x 1 2 m ln 2 π m ln σ 1 2 n k m k 1 ln w x n m 1 2 m ln 2 π m ln σ 2 2 n k 2 m k m 1 ln w x n m so b x a x can be simplified to 46 b x a x m ln σ x 2 σ 1 σ 2 the complexity of this term is ignorable comparing with that of the kalman filter which is used in both fixed and variable window length methods therefore the complexity of proposed algorithm with variable window length and adaptive kalman filter with constant window length is almost the same 4 experimental results in this section performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated for this purpose four sea tests have been performed by an auv in the performed tests imu and dvl sensors have been utilized for velocity estimation and a high performance ins gps dvl has been used as a reference system technical specifications of inertial and aiding sensors and reference systems are shown in tables 1 and 2 in order to check how the proposed algorithm can detect the noise distribution changes 1 h of trajectory of a sea test was selected and two normally distributed random noises with zero means and standard deviations 0 1 and 0 4 m s were added to the velocity provided by the reference system such that standard deviation of the simulated noise changes alternatively from 0 1 to 0 4 every 5 min the added noise to the reference velocity is shown in the upper portion of the fig 3 in the lower portion of the fig 3 value of n v b x a x b y a y is shown at different times according to fig 3 the value of the nv is large on the border of noise variation and is small at the other times in this test length of detection window 2 m has been considered equal to 30 the lower portion of the fig 3 illustrates that the proposed algorithm detects well all of the borders by using the conditional relation 43 in order to examine the effect of dependency of the conventional akf on estimation window length four different tests were performed at sea by the auv specifications of travelled trajectories in each test are expressed in table 3 in these tests the proposed algorithm has been evaluated under different conditions including accelerated and rotational maneuver direct and sweep motions stationary situation and motions with low and high speeds in fig 4 and fig 5 the trajectories travelled by the auv and its velocity are shown respectively in order to validate the estimated velocity horizontal velocities estimated by the algorithms are compared with the one estimated by the reference system the horizontal velocity in knot is computed as follows wikipedia 2016 47 v h v x 2 v y 2 0 5144 where v x and v y are the velocity components in x and y directions and 0 5144 is used for conversion from m s to k n o t in order to quantitatively analyze the velocity quantity the measure of the root mean square error rmse is used as 48 horizontal velocity rmse sqrt mean v h r v h e 2 where v h r and v h e are the reference and estimated horizontal velocity respectively in these tests the auv s velocity has been estimated for different values of estimation window length n fig 6 shows the rmse of horizontal velocity versus n for different field tests as shown in the fig 6 optimum value of the estimation window length adopts different values for various field tests in addition by increasing the n the estimation error either increases or decreases in other words performance of the conventional akf depends greatly on the estimation window length due to variations of the measurement noise distribution therefore choosing a proper value for n is not a convenient task and tuning it through an algorithm facilitates design procedure the results of the estimated horizontal velocity show that both conventional akf and the proposed algorithm can estimate the auv s velocity more accurate than the conventional kf however the important point is that the proposed algorithm does not require manual tuning of the estimation window length and estimates this quantity intelligently in order to quantitatively compare the proposed system with the conventional algorithms the measure of rmse for position is used which is defined as follows 49 rmse sqrt mean d k 2 50 relative rmse rmse travelled distance 100 where d k is absolute error of estimated position forssell 2008 as 51 d k r l e k l r k cos α k and l r k and l e k are reference and estimated latitudes respectively and α k is calculated as follows 52 α k arctan l e k l r k ln tan l e k 2 π 4 tan l r k 2 π 4 where l r k and l e k are reference and estimated longitudes respectively the summary of field tests for the performed tests is expressed in table 4 in this table the results obtained from running the conventional kf the conventional akf and the proposed algorithm are presented it should be noted that the results of conventional akf have been estimated for optimum value of n it is clear that the optimum value of n is unknown before the navigation so the error of the conventional akf practically is more than what written in table 4 performance of the conventional akf is shown in the fig 6 for the other window lengths 5 conclusion in this research the effect of environmental variations on velocity estimation of an auv was studied in the proposed system an ins is used together with a dvl for navigation of the auv since the changes in environmental conditions and sensor s performance result in changing the dvl s noise covariance matrix this matrix cannot be constant in calculations conventional akf adaptively estimates this matrix for reducing the velocity error for this purpose a window of constant length is used at each time step since the noise distribution of measurement changes the choice of window length is not a convenient task in this paper we showed that the performance of conventional akf depends greatly on the estimation window length due to variations of measurement noise distribution in the proposed algorithm the estimation window length is tuned adaptively by detecting the noise distribution variations in dvl s measurement results of the experimental tests showed that intelligently tuning the window length reduces the navigation error up to the minimum value which akf may reach 
23413,in this paper an intelligent adaptive algorithm based on the integrated inertial navigation system ins is presented for estimating the velocity of an autonomous underwater vehicle auv the most common algorithm for incorporating the navigation data is kalman filter kf in the conventional kf algorithm the covariance matrix of measurement noise is considered as a constant through running time the noise covariance in the adaptive kalman filter akf is estimated through processing the innovation sequence inside a window of constant length in actual conditions the correct window length to achieve the best estimation depends on the operational conditions in this paper proper window length in the adaptive algorithm is estimated by processing the probability density function of the innovation sequence at each time step so the window length in the proposed algorithm is variable due to condition changes the proposed integrated navigation system consists of a three axis inertial measurement unit imu and a three axis doppler velocity log dvl the performance of the proposed system is evaluated through four sea tests using an auv experimental results show that the proposed system has superior performance than the conventional kf algorithm and is similar to the optimum akf akf with the best window length keywords doppler velocity log inertial navigation velocity estimation adaptive kalman filter 1 introduction various sensors and methods are used to achieve the speed of underwater vehicles using electromagnetic speed log eml model based methods and doppler velocity log dvl is common to measure and calculate the speed of underwater vehicles in the eml when sea water passes through an electromagnetic field a voltage is created and varies depending upon the speed of the water flow the eml measures the voltage and translates it into the vessel s speed through water there is a correlation between propeller rotation speed propeller torque and relative advance speed in water hence the propeller rotation speed can be used to roughly estimate vehicle relative advance speed allotta et al 2015a 2016b 2015b the eml and propeller model based methods provide the speed relative to water not ground while dvl calculates vehicle s velocity with respect to the sea bottom through emitting acoustic pulses toward seabed and measuring doppler shift of returned pulses with respect to the emitted ones gordon 1996 the dvl translates it into the vessel s speed over ground because of water speed using the relative speed in navigation causes a slight error and it is better to use speed over ground to achieve an accurate navigation accordingly dvl is a widely used sensor for measuring the velocity of underwater vehicles larsen 2000 grenon et al 2001 lee et al 2007 tang et al 2013 gao et al 2014 allotta et al 2016a emami and taban 2017 xu et al 2017 this sensor calculates vessel s speed over ground through emitting acoustic pulses toward seabed for this reason the accuracy of the measured velocity depends on environmental conditions such as depth kind of seabed and ambient acoustic noise sonnenberg 1988 farrell 2008 dvl s measurements are noisy and often contain outlier data hence using dvl individually may not be an appropriate way for accurate navigation a prevalent approach for estimating underwater vehicle s velocity is to integrate dvl s measurements with accelerometer s signals this method is used in the integrated inertial navigation system ins lee and jun 2007 miller et al 2010 hegrenaes and hallingstad 2011 li et al 2013 2015 shabani et al 2015 shabani and gholami 2016 chang et al 2017 kalman filter kf kalman 1960 is the most conventional algorithm for data integration in navigation applications brown and hwang 2012 grewal et al 2013 grewal and andrews 2015 in the kf algorithm the statistics of the filter expressed by the process and measurement noise matrices are considered constant mohamed 1999 these matrices are usually determined either through information presented by manufacturer or data analysis in stationary conditions farrell 2008 groves 2013 in actual conditions noise covariance matrix varies during navigation time variations in the noise covariance matrix of dvl s measurements may be significant due to dependence of dvl on environmental conditions this may cause destructive effects on estimation accuracy therefore estimation algorithm with constant noise covariance must be replaced with an adaptive estimation algorithm throughout the estimation process adaptive kalman filter akf was first proposed by mehra in 1970 where covariance matrices of process and measurement noises are estimated based on the variations of innovation sequence mehra 1970 1972 in navigation applications this algorithm was first used by mohamed and schwarz for estimating the noise covariance matrix in the integrated inertial navigation system global positioning system ins gps mohamed and schwarz 1999 the akf has been widely used in air and land vehicles ever since hide et al 2003 hu et al 2003 ding et al 2007 jwo and weng 2008 jiancheng and sheng 2011 regarding marine applications some studies have been conducted in the recent years for example gao and li have proposed a sage husa based akf for ins dvl navigation system gao and li 2013 gao et al have suggested an adaptive noise estimator for integrated ins dvl system gao et al 2015 recently davari et al have developed a multi rate akf for marine integrated navigation system davari et al 2016 in the conventional akf a fixed length window of innovation sequence is processed at every time instant and noise covariance is estimated inside this window gao et al 2015 the accuracy of innovation covariance matrix estimation depends on the window length system dynamic specifications vehicle manoeuvres and environmental factors may have a major impact on proper choice of this parameter mohamed and schwarz 1999 for example in ins dvl navigation under the conditions that vehicle motion has high frequency variations or outlier data in dvl s measurements occurs the window length must adopt a small value to be able to detect rapid changes nonetheless under the conditions that system dynamic changes mildly and the noise of dvl s measurement has steady distribution it is better to select a large value for window length to achieve a better estimate of innovation covariance matrix since operational conditions of the system are not predictable the variations of the dvl noise cannot be predicted therefore it is not possible to determine an optimal window length in this paper a novel intelligent integrated navigation system is presented in which the length of estimation window is adaptively tuned through detecting the noise distribution changes along the innovation vector time instants of the variations occurred in the measurement noise are detected in order to determine a proper value for window length window length is set to a small value at these time instants also the window length is set to a large value at time instants at which the variance of dvl noise is constant maximum value is selected such that the location of considerable variations in the noise does not lie inside the window results of the experimental tests performed at sea show that the proposed algorithm is a proper solution to remove the confusion of designer in determining the window length evaluation of the proposed algorithm has been done through an integrated navigation system composed of a three axis inertial measurement unit imu and a three axis dvl installed on an autonomous underwater vehicle auv in this paper since the used auv has mild dynamic the covariance matrix of process noise is assumed to be constant the structure of the paper is as follows after introduction the equations related to the integrated navigation system are given in section 2 in section 3 the equations of the proposed algorithm are derived in section 4 experimental results of the proposed system will be presented finally section 5 draws a conclusion of the paper 2 integrated navigation system in this section first system and measurement

with the system states which are corrupted by noise the measurement model can be expressed by the following equation 13 v b h x υ v c b n 1 v n υ v where v b v x v y v z t is dvl measurement vector in the body frame υ v υ x υ y υ z t is the measurement noise vector modelled as an additive white gaussian noise with zero mean and covariance matrix r as 14 r σ x 2 0 0 0 σ y 2 0 0 0 σ z 2 where σ x 2 σ y 2 and σ z 2 are the variances of dvl measurements 2 3 data integration since the navigation system s kinematic equations are non linear in an ins dvl integrated navigation system it is not possible to use the linear kf so the extended kalman filter ekf is usually used for data integration in this system kf algorithm comprises two steps prediction step and correction step whose equations will be described as follows we have considered the system in discrete time form in which k denotes the present time t k 2 3 1 prediction step in the prediction section the total state of the system and its covariance matrix are predicted as follows sarkka 2013 15 x ˆ k t k 1 t k f x ˆ k 1 u k 1 0 d t 16 p k a k 1 p k 1 a k 1 t q k 1 here x ˆ k and x ˆ k are the predicted and the corrected estimations of the state respectively p k and p k are covariance matrices of the predicted and the corrected state error respectively the discretized matrices a k and q k can be computed as follows maybeck 1997 17 a k e f k d t 18 q k 1 2 a k g k q c g k t a k t g k q c g k t d t where d t is the sampling time of the inertial sensors and f k and g k are computed as follows 19 f k f x x ˆ k g k f w x ˆ k the prediction of state at t k can be performed by rectangular integration as 20 x ˆ k x ˆ k 1 δ x 1 21 δ x 1 f x ˆ k 1 u k 1 d t 2 3 2 correction step since the sampling frequencies of the aiding sensors are different correction step executes asynchronously on receiving new aiding measurement v b from dvl in the event of being correct navigation state and its covariance matrix are corrected by the

2 δ a m a x where ζ x k and ζ y k are filter innovation vectors in directions of x and y at time step k δ a m a x is the detection threshold of outlier data 3 proposed adaptive algorithm in the proposed algorithm the process noise covariance matrix is considered as a constant q c c t e and the measurement noise covariance matrix is estimated adaptively in the kf algorithm the innovation sequence at time step k is the difference between the real measurement received from the aiding sensor and corresponding predicted quantity as 27 ζ k v k b v ˆ k where ζ k ζ x k ζ y k ζ z k t v k b and v ˆ k are filter innovation vector dvl s measurement vector and predicted measurement vector at time step k respectively the measurement vector is predicted by measurement model function as follows 28 v ˆ k h x k and the measurement noise covariance matrix can be estimated as follows mehra 1970 29 r ˆ k c ˆ v k h k p k h k t note that by knowing the innovation sequence the innovation covariance matrix can be computed through averaging inside a window of length n as 30 c ˆ v k 1 n j j 0 k ζ j ζ j t where j 0 k n 1 is the first instant inside the estimation window according to fig 1 the akf has additional computations for estimating the matrices c ˆ v k and r ˆ k block diagram of an akf based integrated navigation system is also depicted in fig 2 in eq 30 window length is considered as a constant however in practice optimal value of this parameter changes due to change of measurement noise distribution caused by environmental conditions and sensor performance in order to solve this problem an intelligent approach for adaptively estimating the window length based on verification on measurement noise distribution is proposed to detect the change in the noise distribution of dvl s measurement at every time step a window of length 2 m named detection window is considered innovation sequence in the direction of x inside this window can be shown as ζ x k 2 m ζ x k m ζ x k 1 where ζ x k is the x component of the innovation sequence at time step k in normal conditions x component of dvl s measurement vector in the whole of detection window has a white gaussian noise with zero mean and variance σ x 2 therefore probability density function pdf of x component of innovation inside the detection window can be expressed as follows 31 p d f x ζ x k 1 2 π σ x 2 e ζ x k 2 2 σ x 2 ζ x k n 0 σ x 2 environmental conditions in the sea at different times and positions are always variable and whenever this happens changes in distribution of noise and outliers in the measurement of dvl occur if noise variance changes gradually its duration will be large compared to detection window in this case the noise pdf in detection window will be almost fixed therefore matrix c ˆ v k can be computed with acceptable approximation from eq 30 nonetheless if changes in pdf of noise happen so fast that two different pdfs exist eq 30 does not yield accurate estimation of the innovation covariance matrix hence it is required to detect the border of noise variation inside detection window in this case the data received before the recognized border must not be used to estimate the innovation covariance matrix corresponding to the times after the border in other words upon detecting the noise border estimation window length must be reset it is evident that between two noise borders an increase in the estimation window length results in improving the estimation accuracy of the covariance matrix therefore in the proposed algorithm estimation window length increases between two borders and is reset upon arriving the window to each border in order to detect noise border in our algorithm square of the innovation is processed for this purpose we shall express the cumulative distribution function cdf of the square of the innovation if w x k ζ x k 2 then cdf of the square of the innovation can be obtained as follows 32 c d f w x k w x k p w x k ζ x k w x k c d f x w x k c d f x w x k where w x k is square of innovation in the direction of x at time step k the pdf of w x k can be obtained by differentiating both sides of the eq 32 as follows 33 p d f w x k w x k 1 2 w x k p d f x w x k p d f x w x k 1 2 π σ x 2 w x k e w x k 2 σ x 2 the variance of dvl s measurement noise inside the detection window of length 2 m can be obtained by maximum likelihood ml estimation if sequence w x inside the detection window is shown as w x w x k 2 m w x k m w x k 1 since data of sequence w x are independent the pdf of the sequence w x equals the product of the individual sequence data 34 p d f w x w x n k 2 m k 1 1 2 π σ x 2 w x n e w x n 2 σ x 2 where w x w x k 2 m w x k m w x k 1 in order to compute the variance σ x 2 by using the ml estimation p d f w x w x or ln p d f w x w x must be maximized hence the variance σ x 2 can be calculated as follows 35 ln p d f w x w x 1 2 n k 2 m k 1 ln 2 π σ x 2 w x n w x n σ x 2 a x 36 σ x 2 a x 0 solution of the eq 36 yields the σ x 2 as follows 37 σ x 2 1 2 m n k 2 m k 1 w x n in order to detect the border of noise variation the middle point of the sliding detection window is checked at each time step if this point is the border of noise variation the pdf in the whole of detection window equals the product of the pdfs in two regions 38 p d f w x w x n k m k 1 1 2 π σ 1 2 w x n e w x n 2 σ 1 2 n k 2 m k m 1 1 2 π σ 2 2 w x n e w x n 2 σ 2 2 which the first region has a gaussian noise distribution with variance σ 1 2 and also the second one has a gaussian noise distribution with variance σ 2 2 these variances can be obtained by ml estimation as follows 39 σ 1 2 1 m n k m k 1 w x n 40 σ 2 2 1 m n k 2 m k m 1 w x n similar to eq 35 the pdf of the sequence w x can be obtained under the conditions of distribution noise variation as follows 41 ln p d f w x w x 1 2 n k m k 1 ln 2 π σ 1 2 w x n w x n σ 1 2 1 2 n k 2 m k m 1 ln 2 π σ 2 2 w x n w x n σ 2 2 b x other equations similar to 35 and 41 can also be obtained for the y direction existence of the noise border in the middle of detection window can be detected through values a x and b x if the border of the noise variation lies in the middle of the detection window the value b x will be greater than a x otherwise the value a x is greater than b x results of the experimental tests at sea show that the noise variation in the x and y axes occurs simultaneously therefore to detect this event the following condition relation is checked 42 b x a x b y a y t where t is a threshold value which is determined by the designer considering a large value for t may cause the noise border not to be detected conversely selecting a small value for t may cause slight variations in the noise variance to be recognized and consequently numerous borders to be detected results of the simulation and experimental tests show that t m is a proper choice therefore the condition expressed in eq 42 must be checked at each time step when this condition is satisfied noise variation is occurred and hereafter the data received prior to detected border are not used for estimating the innovation covariance matrix in this case the estimation of c ˆ v k is done by using a window of length n 2 if no variation in noise distribution is detected estimation window length will be increased linearly with time since increase in the estimation window length increases computational load a maximum value can be considered for it as a result adaptive tuning of estimation window length is expressed as follows 43 n k 2 if b x a x b y a y t or δ ζ x k 2 δ ζ y k 2 δ a m a x n k n k 1 1 otherwise according to eq 43 estimation window length is reset in two cases variation in noise variance or occurrence of drop out although the condition related to variation in noise variance also detects occurrence of drop out to a large extent utilizing the condition related to the occurrence of drop out in eq 43 individually makes the detection of border of noise variation more accurate it should be noted that the equations eq 35 and eq 41 can be simplified as follows 44 a x 1 2 2 m ln 2 π 2 m ln σ x 2 n k 2 m k 1 ln w x n 2 m 45 b x 1 2 m ln 2 π m ln σ 1 2 n k m k 1 ln w x n m 1 2 m ln 2 π m ln σ 2 2 n k 2 m k m 1 ln w x n m so b x a x can be simplified to 46 b x a x m ln σ x 2 σ 1 σ 2 the complexity of this term is ignorable comparing with that of the kalman filter which is used in both fixed and variable window length methods therefore the complexity of proposed algorithm with variable window length and adaptive kalman filter with constant window length is almost the same 4 experimental results in this section performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated for this purpose four sea tests have been performed by

velocity components in x and y directions and 0 5144 is used for conversion from m s to k n o t in order to quantitatively analyze the velocity quantity the measure of the root mean square error rmse is used as 48 horizontal velocity rmse sqrt mean v h r v h e 2 where v h r and v h e are the reference and estimated horizontal velocity respectively in these tests the auv s velocity has been estimated for different values of estimation window length n fig 6 shows the rmse of horizontal velocity versus n for different field tests as shown in the fig 6 optimum value of the estimation window length adopts different values for various field tests in addition by increasing the n the estimation error either increases or decreases in other words performance of the conventional akf depends greatly on the estimation window length due to variations of the measurement noise distribution therefore choosing a proper value for n is not a convenient task and tuning it through an algorithm facilitates design procedure the results of the estimated horizontal velocity show that both conventional akf and the proposed algorithm can estimate the auv s velocity more accurate than the conventional kf however the important point is that the proposed algorithm does not require manual tuning of the estimation window length and estimates this quantity intelligently in order to quantitatively compare the proposed system with the conventional algorithms the measure of rmse for position is used which is defined as follows 49 rmse sqrt mean d k 2 50 relative rmse rmse travelled

calculated as follows 52 α k arctan l e k l r k ln tan l e k 2 π 4 tan l r k 2 π 4 where l r k and l e k are reference and estimated longitudes respectively the summary of field tests for the performed tests is expressed in table 4 in this table the results obtained from running the conventional kf the conventional akf and the proposed algorithm are presented it should be noted that the results of conventional akf have been estimated for optimum value of n it is clear that the optimum value of n is unknown before the navigation so the error of the conventional akf practically is more than what written in table 4 performance of the conventional akf is shown in the fig 6 for the other window lengths 5 conclusion in this research the effect of environmental variations on velocity estimation of an auv was studied in the proposed system an ins is used together with a dvl for navigation of the auv since the changes in environmental conditions and sensor s performance result in changing the dvl s noise covariance matrix this matrix cannot be constant in calculations conventional akf adaptively estimates this matrix for reducing the velocity error for this purpose a window of constant length is used at each time step since the noise distribution of measurement changes the choice of window length is not a convenient task in this paper we showed that the performance of conventional akf depends greatly on the estimation window length due to variations of measurement noise distribution in the proposed algorithm the estimation window length is tuned adaptively by detecting the noise distribution variations in dvl s measurement results of the experimental tests showed that intelligently tuning the window length reduces the navigation error up to the minimum value which akf may reach 
23414,fire in the topside production area of offshore oil and gas o g platforms has the potential to trigger cascading events and may lead to catastrophic consequences for operators environment and asset safety barriers such as hardware systems and emergency response are critical elements aimed at preventing the propagation of this type of scenarios harsh environmental conditions may strongly affect the integrity of protective equipment and significantly hinder an effective and timely emergency response with a consequent increase in the risk level the present study is aimed at developing a structured methodology to the quantitative performance assessment of safety barriers specifically addressing the analysis of offshore facilities operating in harsh and sensitive environment an expert judgment elicitation procedure is adopted to score external factors associated with harsh environmental conditions simplified relationships are established for availability and effectiveness evaluation of safety barriers in offshore o g platforms a dedicated framework is developed for the analysis of emergency response the approach is tested through the application to a case study aimed at the assessment of the influence of harsh environmental conditions on the risk due to cascading events in a reference offshore installation keywords harsh environment major accident hazard offshore oil gas installations safety barriers cascading events 1 introduction in the last decades energy request has been increasing due to a continuous economic and social progress although renewable resources are increasingly developed according to the international energy agency the primary energy resource is still fossil fuels and their demand is expected to grow by more than 35 in the period 2010 to 2040 iea international energy agency 2017 the raising energy demand drives oil gas o g exploration companies to search for novel reservoirs therefore exploration activities are moving towards arctic and sub arctic regions along the norwegian american and russian continental shelfs according to the united states geological survey 22 of world hydrocarbon reserves are contained in these areas www usgs gov the exploration of these areas started in the early 1960s national petroleum council 2015 however their harsh climate conditions entail undertakings and risks for drilling operations paltrinieri et al 2017a b the oil production in these areas encounters different challenges due to cold harsh climate wind snowfall darkness and sensitive environment with respect to pollution the weather may delay operations as well as maintenance activities and the remoteness of the installations may lead to logistic and emergency response problems besides severe legislative frameworks are in force for environmental protection norwegian environment agency 2011 poor experience in design and operations of arctic o g facilities within harsh environment and difficulties in emergency response and management may represent critical issues to overcome as bercha et al 2003 and gao et al 2010 affirm technical and operational performance of safety barriers are critical aspects to be addressed in these specific conditions the effect of the environment and external factors on systems reliability have been investigated in the past and several models are available in the literature such as the proportional hazard model phm cox 1972 or the accelerated failure time model kalbfleisch and prentice 2002 on the other hand innovative techniques for operational support may be applied to such scenarios landucci and paltrinieri 2016 paltrinieri et al 2017a b paltrinieri and khan 2016 systems maintainability is also affected by external environment maintenance relies on resources such as operators tools and equipment accessibility and testing in arctic conditions operators may delay or may be unable to perform maintenance activities remoteness may hinder the deployment of tools and equipment needed and these may result in overdue or inappropriate maintenance these issues were specifically addressed in the work by gao et al 2010 despite that risk based design enhancing safety of operations in harsh environment was discussed by several authors gao et al 2010 paik et al 2011 vinnem 2014 a comprehensive and systematic safety assessment is still lacking for accident scenarios associated with offshore o g facilities in harsh environment among the most critical accident scenarios which may affect o g extraction and production facilities fires and explosions may directly cause severe damage to human health and environment but also affect the structural integrity of the facility and asset in this latter case accidents may propagate among different equipment processing or storing hydrocarbons eventually leading to the amplification of consequences khakzad and reniers 2015 necci et al 2015 those scenarios are indicated as cascading or domino events cozzani and reniers 2013 and severely affected offshore o g installations e g piper alpha disaster july 1988 lord cullen 1990 and macondo blowout april 2010 bp 2010 and more in general the process industry cozzani and reniers 2013 in the last decades the hazards posed by cascading events inspired the development of different approaches aimed at accounting this event in risk analysis and management bagster and pitblado 1991 cozzani et al 2005 gledhill and lines 1998 more recent approaches proposed for cascading events triggered by fire assessment included monte carlo simulations abdolhamidzadeh et al 2010 simplified risk indexes cozzani et al 2009 zhang and chen 2011 and tools based on bayesian networks khakzad et al 2013 eventually accounting for analysis of safety barrier performance khakzad et al 2017 however none of the mentioned approaches addresses the influence of harsh environmental conditions on risk evaluation and possible prevention or mitigation associated with the performance of safety barriers a preliminary attempt to analyse cascading events triggered by fire in harsh environmental conditions was developed by landucci et al 2017 the authors improved a methodology for the quantitative assessment of safety barriers based on event tree analysis landucci et al 2016 2015 introducing the analysis of environmental effect on the performance of safety barriers accounting for external factors such as cold weather extreme snow wind or other meteorological conditions however the approach was primarily focused on the assessment of cascading event risk for onshore facilities without specific and detailed analysis to the peculiar aspects of emergency rescue and response in o g offshore installations therefore the present work addresses the need for a systematic framework for risk analysis of cascading events assessment and emergency response the focus is on the performance of safety barrier mitigating fired domino scenarios in offshore platforms and facilities the effects of harsh environmental conditions are included in the investigation in order to develop a comprehensive framework able to analyse how domino frequency or probability may vary due to external severe weather conditions the paper is structured as follows in section 2 a detailed overview of the developed methodology is provided a description of the case study installation and the meteorological characterization of the area where it operates are provided in section 3 results are presented in section 4 while section 5 discusses the overall findings conclusions are provided in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 overview the present work is based on a methodology aimed at evaluating the performance of safety barriers in o g facilities operating in offshore harsh environment fig 1 reports the flowchart of the methodology detailing the specific features the preliminary step of the methodology step 1 in fig 1 is aimed at the identification of safety barriers that are installed on offshore o g installations in order to prevent and or mitigate the occurrence of cascading events barriers are identified according to specific standards and guidelines american petroleum institute 2007a hse health and safety executive 1992 iso international standardization organization 1999 psa 2013 each safety barrier is characterized by protection performance parameters in order to support further steps for the quantitative characterization in step 2 see fig 1 a harsh environmental score namely hes is determined based on a weighted combination of penalties associated with external climate and environmental factors e g cold temperatures wind waves snowfall etc in this step a specific elicitation process and a novel aggregation procedure is adopted to reduce the uncertainties in the methodology the so evaluated hes is applied in step 3 see fig 1 in order to determine the quantitative parameters related to the performance of the safety barriers in harsh environment the safety barriers performance is expressed in terms of i availability i e the capability of the barrier to respond on demand and ii effectiveness i e the capability of the barrier to effectively mitigate or prevent an escalation scenario once activated landucci et al 2015 2016 it is worth noticing that the definition of availability provided in this framework has been proven to be in line with the aramis project dianous and de fiévez 2006 definition of level of confidence while the definition of effectiveness includes both definitions of effectiveness and response time of the aramis project both availability and effectiveness are influenced by the harsh environmental conditions and hes is adopted to tailor these parameters for the location under analysis an aspect that constitutes a relevant element of novelty in the present work is related to the detailed performance analysis of emergency response time specific for offshore platforms which to the best of our knowledge was never undertaken before in the framework of cascading events analysis finally the safety barrier performance data obtained are implemented in an event tree analysis based on specific gates for the analysis of fire induced cascading events in order to determine the annual probability of escalation scenarios step 4 in fig 1 2 2 identification and characterization of reference safety barriers control and mitigation of fires and explosions in o g offshore facilities is ruled by different standards and guidelines american petroleum institute 2007a 2007b hse health and safety executive 1992 iso international standardization organization 1999 which are hereby taken as basis to identify the required safety measures according to ccps center of chemical process safety 2000 barriers are classified as passive protections which are already in place and do not require external activation active protections which require automatic external activation procedural and emergency measures which involve the intervention of operators and emergency teams several pieces of equipment are installed on offshore installations featuring different sets of protection systems hse hse health and safety executive 1992 a synthetic and comprehensive set of reference safety barriers for offshore installations are determined landucci et al 2015 in particular inherent safety analysis allowed performing a screening among the process units typically installed in extraction and production offshore o g sites the domino actual hazard index cozzani et al 2013 2009 has been applied in this analysis it is a method based on the identification of penalties for process equipment and to the calculation of a dedicated index describing the criticality of each item to domino escalation scenarios the procedure has been applied to the different process area equipment the first stage horizontal separator was identified as the most critical unit for domino effect propagation and thus it was taken as reference unit then according to hse hse health and safety executive 1992 the safety barriers associated to this type of equipment were identified and constitute the object of the present analysis the selected safety barriers are summarized in table 1 it is worth to noticing that only the systems relevant for domino prevention are listed below as shown in table 1 two types of active fire protection systems are considered a systems for the delivery of fire fighting agents such as water or water based foam which are designed among other functions to mitigate fire exposure of the target norsok 2008 b emergency isolation systems through shutdown which is designed to isolate a target unit reducing the potential loss and consequent damage connected to the large inventory in the framework of escalation prevention the application of fireproofing materials constitutes a relevant and effective passive safety barrier aimed at delaying fire heating fireproofing is often combined with emergency relief systems in order to limit the vessel pressure build up due to the liquid temperature increase american petroleum institute api 1999 sci steel construction institute 1992 finally procedural and emergency measures include the relevant operating procedures with respect to escalation prevention and to support the coordinated response to a major accident scenario for offshore installations the emergency response consists in both actions taken from personnel on board to contain and or control the hazard and actions carried out by trained personnel approaching the facility from the safety and rescue vessels a survey of performance data for safety barriers summarized in table 1 was carried out in a previous work in which a specific data repository was built landucci et al 2015 these performance data are hereby taken as initial reference to support the analysis of safety barrier performance in harsh environment conditions active fire protections are complex systems and their availability expressed in terms of pfd probability of failure on demand is evaluated using fault tree analysis where dependencies and common cause of failures are addressed through the beta factor method schueller 1997 the successful application of active fire protection does not guarantee the prevention of escalation hence the evaluation of system effectiveness through quantitative parameters is required passive fire protections can be considered as single components and then their availability is derived conservatively from specific literature national fire protection agency nfpa 2009 2 3 definition of harsh environment score hes 2 3 1 hes evaluation approach in order to assess the influence of harsh environment indications about the influence of different site specific environmental parameters such as temperature wind and waves height are combined in order to define the harsh environmental score hes in sight of indexes for extreme meteorological conditions such as the severe weather threat index sweat miller 1972 and the severe thunderstorm index sti maglaras and lapenta 1997 the hes is defined as a weighted summation of the atmospheric parameters and it represents a preliminary metric to assess the harshness of the environment where the facility is located hes is used to consider the influence of environmental conditions on barrier performance as explained in sections 2 4 and 2 5 fig 2 shows the hierarchical evaluation process for hes according to landucci et al 2017 to which the reader is referred for more details 2 3 2 definition of stressors and penalties the approach for the evaluation of hes shown in fig 2 is based on the identification of stressors stressors are factors that mostly affect the human performance in operations in extreme weather conditions a generic taxonomy of stressors is provided by kim and jung 2003 musharraf et al 2013 analyse the most relevant stressors in harsh environment according to previous works from bercha 2006 and bercha et al 2003 according to these studies the significant stressors in harsh environments are coldness or warmth ice slippery difficulty in breathing combined weather effect low visibility and remoteness to each stressor one or more external factors ef are associated efs are climate or environmental conditions that can be measured or quantified for the site under analysis and that have a significant impact on the correspondent stressor a non dimensional penalty s is assigned to each ef this represents the distance from favourable environmental conditions and it scores from 0 to 1 where 0 represents the good conditions and 1 the worst ones penalties are then combined according to the rules described in section 2 3 3 specific environmental conditions of the site of interest should be collected while assigning the penalties the penalty increases the relevance of the ef for the case study under analysis the overview of stressors external factors and penalty system applied in the present study is provided in table 2 the parameters aimed at determining the ef score are ranked in order to assess the effect of adverse meteorological conditions on plant operation performance the ranges of the parameter are derived from literature survey and documented elsewhere landucci et al 2017 the weather parameters used are average values over a year the aim of the hes is to describe to some extent the harshness of the environment where the installation is located it is not meant to describe the condition at a given point in time e g today the following sections report the main highlights about the effect of each external factor on human performance and about the penalty system adopted in table 2 cold weather inhibits operator s performance inducing difficulty in breathing or slippery due to ice musharraf et al 2013 in recommended practices rp 581 from american petroleum institute 2000 specific penalties are associated to operation in cold environments on the basis of the external temperature external factor 1 these penalties as shown in table 2 are adapted in this framework a further penalty is considered in the presence of hot weather conditions when the temperature is higher than the one representing tropical ambient conditions 45 c iacs international association of classification societies 1978 wind affects human and objects the beaufort wind force scale shaw and austin 1919 is considered in this framework in order to account of the ef2 extreme wind speed the scale identifies 13 classes associated to different beaufort numbers from force 0 to force 12 the intermediate levels are identified according to a linearly increasing behaviour with respect to the wind speed at 10 m above sea level each class represents different sea and land conditions the present work considers the scale up to force 8 defined as gale in this condition the operators walking against the wind feel inconvenience on offshore installations the edges are the critical areas exposed to high wind the process area is conventionally protected against external wind anyway strong wind may significantly affect the safety vessel response and the operations carried out by the emergency crew then it is a factor that should be taken into account in the present analysis conservatively the present framework assigns the unitary penalty to the gale condition and no penalty is considered below the light breeze condition force 2 in beaufort scale the intermediate wind speed ranges are scored with penalties linearly increasing from 0 to 1 shaw and austin 1919 waves ef3 may generates seasickness on offshore operators the effect of waves is different on different type of installations for example fixed installations do not experience at all any problem due to the state of the sea the situation is critical for floating units both processing installations and supply vessels the parameter considered in assessing the severity of wave conditions is the significant wave height i e the average of the higher one third of the waves considering a stated sea surface and ordering the waves for increasing height according to pafa consulting engineers 2001 the critical waves height resulting in adverse sea state is in the range of 3 4 m then the maximum penalty is associated to waves exceeding 4 m height the classification of severity classes for waves according to douglas sea scale pafa consulting engineers 2001 is adopted in order to identify the ranges of heights and to associate them a penalty douglas scale identifies ten degrees of severity for wave conditions with nearly logarithmic increment with respect to wave height no penalty is associated with calm sea condition i e wave height less than 0 1 m snow load ef4 may limit operator movements in offshore installation the parameter adopted in quantifying its effect is the snowfall i e the depth of snow that accumulate between an observation and another one in order to penalize snowfall on human performance the scoring system is based on the classes of annual snowfall identified by kunkel et al 2007 the scale identifies three classes of severity for snowfall precipitation the maximum penalty is assigned for precipitation higher than 2 m year while no penalty is considered for snowfall lower than 0 125 m year intermediate values are defined according to a linearly increasing law visibility may be reduced due to the combined effect of fog and snow ef5 and sunlight hours ef6 it is a critical factor for emergency intervention and platform rescue and evacuation limited visibility may delay significantly these operations and it may lead to severe scenarios the metric for visibility penalization due to fog and snow is determined according to visibility table from supplementary surface weather report suprep code by doa department of army 1982 the minimum visibility range in suprep code is associate to the maximum penalty e g 1 a logarithmic decreasing penalty is associated to intermediate visibility classes no penalty is associate to visibility equal or higher than the typical maximum extension of an industrial facility in order to assess the visibility reduction due to darkness the climatological indicator sunshine duration is adopted it measures the cumulative time during which an area receives direct irradiance from the sun for at least 120 w m2 the ranges for sunlight hours in a given location are defined according to the categorization by landsberg and pinna 1978 the maximum penalty is assumed for these area with the minimum range of annual sunshine hours while no penalties is considered in locations with ordinary sunlight duration i e one third of the total time as annual average the remoteness factor ef7 in table 2 is associated with fear and homesickness musharraf et al 2013 due to relevant uncertainties in measuring the impact of remoteness on human behaviour the framework adopts a semi quantitative approach in case the analyst deems that this aspect is critical a unitary penalty is assigned an intermediate score e g 0 5 may be also assigned in case the analyst deems relevant to consider this factor at medium priority while a null score is assigned otherwise 2 3 3 penalties aggregation once the penalties s are associated to each of the n external factors relevant for the case under analysis hes is evaluated as a weighted summation as follows 1 h e s i 1 n w i s i where s i and w i are respectively the score and the weight associated to the i th ef the choice of the weighted summation for penalties aggregation is in accordance with a previous work landucci et al 2017 weights are assigned in order to associate a different level of importance within each ef or eventually to exclude those that are not relevant for the case study weights are assigned to each ef and they are representative of the judgement of the assessor also on the basis of interviews with workers and managers of the company operating facility zipf s law has been adopted in order to obtain a preliminary set of weights zipf 1949 a simplified version of zipf s law predicts that out of a population of n elements the frequency of elements of rank j called f j n is 2 f j n 1 j n 1 n 1 j n the efs are ranked in five classes according to the judgement of the assessor and also on the basis of interviews with workers and managers operating on offshore floating units table 3 shows the ranking of the efs obtained from experts elicitation and adopted in this framework efs classified in the higher ranks 1 2 are those judged as more critical on the basis of the ranking defined for offshore installations weights are assigned to each ef as shown in table 3 2 4 hardware barrier performance assessment extreme environmental conditions may seriously affect the availability of hardware components gao et al 2010 both active and passive barriers may deteriorate due to cold erosion wind snow and ice with significant worsening of their protective performance in this study it is assumed that harsh environment seriously affect barrier availability while no significant effects are associated to the effectiveness gao et al 2010 according to the recommended practices rp 581 by the american petroleum institute 2000 the depletion of barrier performance in harsh conditions is strictly related to environmental temperature in particular environmental temperature may affect barrier availability when its values is below a given threshold value of 6 7 c american petroleum institute 2000 this value corresponds to a penalty for external temperature s1 in table 2 equal to 0 6 in this framework we assumed that for s1 lower than 0 6 no relevant performance modifications are accounted and data for safety barriers operating in normal environment may be adopted see e g the data repository reported by landucci et al 2015 for s1 higher than 0 6 depletion of barrier availability in arctic environment is addressed using the phm cox 1972 as suggested by gao et al 2010 the approach modifies the failure rate of a generic component λ in case of harsh environment as 3 λ z λ 0 e 1 409 z 1 1 013 z 2 where λ 0 is the baseline failure rate in normal environment assumed as constant during the lifecycle of the facility and z 1 and z 2 are the covariates assumed as binary described in table 4 in order to obtain baseline failure rates value λ 0 a pfd data repository for the considered barrier is needed landucci et al 2015 an equivalent failure rate was derived by applying the base relationship for the estimation of tested component unavailability lees 1996 to p f d 0 the baseline failure rate is then 4 p f d 1 2 λ θ λ 0 2 p f d 0 θ 0 where θ 0 is the baseline test interval assumed equal to 1 year 8760 h for industrial facility located in normal environment eq 1 is then applied to calculate the modified failure rate λ z and then the pfd in harsh environment may be calculated according to the previous eq 4 in this case a modified test interval θ is considered in order to take into account of delays in maintenance operations less frequent shutdowns due to difficulties in accessing the area or difficulties in performing tests that harsh environment may involve such problems are accounted by an increase of test interval based on the information gathered for the facility under analysis the test interval is set as 10000 h in harsh environmental conditions in the present work it is assumed that cold environment does not affect the effectiveness of active barriers once activated see landucci et al 2017 for more details therefore the effectiveness associated with the active safety barriers listed in table 1 may be considered as in the case of normal environment landucci et al 2015 the effectiveness of the water deluge system wds01 is determined based on the outcomes of experimental studies hankinson and lowesmith 2004 roberts 2004a 2004b shirvill 2004 on pressurized vessels engulfed by fire in which the reduction in the incident thermal radiation due to wds was evaluated these studies allowed defining a numerical parameter namely intensity reduction factor ϕ in order to quantify the wds effectiveness ϕ represents the reduction in heat load q h l due to the presence of the activated wds based on the numerical results of the experimental studies ϕ has been selected as 0 50 the heat load q w d s in case of available wds indicates wds performance and is obtained as 5 q w d s φ q h l the emergency shut down esd system is activated to stop the leakage that feeds the primary fire scenario the effectiveness of the esd is related to the maximum response time of the system in case of successful activation it is assumed that the esd system isolate the leak within 3 min with unitary effectiveness landucci et al 2015 passive safety protections include pressure safety valve psv and fireproofing coatings the presence of the psv alone is proved birk 2006 not to be sufficient to significantly delay the time to failure ttf of the target equipment in this case the effectiveness is considered as unitary but the ttf is evaluated using the unprotected vessel correlation fireproofing coatings are able to delay the vessel failure in case of availability of this protection a unitary effectiveness is assumed in this framework the ttf of the unprotected target equipment is added by a further term namely ttfc representing the delay action of the coating ttfc is evaluated according to a simplified approach if high performance materials designed to specifically withstand severe fire conditions are adopted intumescent vermiculite spray fibrous mineral wool the ttfc is assumed conservatively as 70 min if common insulating materials glass wool rock wool are used as protection the ttfc is set equal to 0 min considering inadequate the fireproofing protections in delaying the target failure further details are provided in section 2 5 2 5 emergency response performance assessment musharraf et al 2013 point out how human reliability may be significantly affected by extreme weather causing the increment of pfd of emergency barriers where human interventions are involved and possible delays in deployment and operations the decrement in the availability increment of pfd of the emergency response in harsh environment is estimated based on the framework proposed in the success likelihood index methodology slim method embrey 1986 slim is a technique used for assessing human error probability in the framework of tasks based on procedures a set of performance shaping factors psf is defined for each task and for each psf the assessor is requested to assign a weight the combination of psfs is defined as success likelihood index sli ranging from zero to one sli approaching one represents a situation close to the ideal conditions in performing the task sli is converted to human pfd according to 6 log 10 p f d a 0 s l i b 0 where a 0 and b 0 are determined assuming two known values of pfd corresponding to sli 0 and sli 1 embrey 1986 in the present methodology the hes defined in section 2 3 is assumed as a simplified ranking of the psfs affecting the emergency response in harsh environments landucci et al 2017 the higher the hes value the lower the likelihood of success for the emergency response task eq 6 is then modified as 7 log 10 p f d a 1 h e s b where a and b are respectively 0 954 and 0 046 and they are determined on the basis of the following assumptions in the case of favourable environmental conditions hes 0 the pfd is set equal to 0 1 according to standards from the emergency team intervention landucci et al 2015 in the case of worst environmental conditions hes 1 the pfd is set equal to 0 9 as a conservative maximum human error probability musharraf et al 2013 for the evaluation of emergency intervention effectiveness a specific approach was developed for offshore installations the effectiveness of the emergency response is quantified by defining a time scale for emergency intervention landucci et al 2015 a specific metric namely time for final mitigation tfm is defined tfm is the characteristic time for the effective intervention of the external emergency teams and it is defined as the maximum time needed to primary fire suppression or effective cooling action on the target equipment the present approach details a specific time scale for emergency intervention in manned offshore facilities on the basis of norsok standard z 013 norsok 2010 fig 3 a graphically represents the different phases involved in offshore external emergency response the emergency intervention time scale is described in the following five different phases time to alert τ 1 it is the maximum time required to start emergency operations it is defined as the time needed for the primary fire to be detected and the alarm to be given onsite alerting personnel on board and offsite activation of external emergency response time for mustering τ 2 it is the time needed for on board personnel to reach the temporary refugee tr that usually acts as mustering point during the mustering phase information about the primary fire are collected and provided to the operators in the control room time for onsite mitigation τ 3 it is the time needed by expert on board personnel for carrying out control actions in that phase the personnel on board not involved in this operations starts the evacuation in the case the escalation is considered likely to occur time for evacuation and rescue τ 4 it is the time needed for reaching the lifeboats by both expert and other personnel the rescue is considered completed when the lifeboats enter the safe area time for external firefighting intervention τ 5 it is the time needed by the stand by vessel to approach the installation and extinguish the primary fire and cooling the target equipment it is worth noticing that the main aim of emergency intervention in manned installation is the safe rescue of personnel while the purpose of this framework is to evaluate the safety of assets in the presence of fire scenarios potentially escalating in domino event for this reason τ 5 is included in the analysis unlike in the norsok standard norsok 2010 the tfm with respect to asset safety is then defined as the summation of operations times τ i as follows 8 t f m τ 1 τ 5 fig 3b provides a graphical representation of the time scale for sake of clarity the tfm is compared with the ttf of the target equipment while assessing the emergency response effectiveness landucci et al 2015 the effectiveness is set as unitary when tfm is lower than ttf in normal conditions the time to alarm τ 1 value in an offshore facility is assumed equal to 3 min baseline value the time for external intervention τ 5 depends on site specific characteristics and on the vessel policy adopted by the company the baseline value depends on the distance between the shore and the installation and it should be assessed for the facility under analysis in favourable meteorological conditions an example is provided in the case study section of this work harsh conditions may seriously affect the tfm with possible delay associated for instance to increased deployment time difficulties in reaching remote locations or difficult in operations detailed studies on emergency service response time on land are available in the literature based on statistical analyses devoted to fire brigade response taylor 2016 and emergency medical service matteson et al 2011 in the present study the following relationship is adopted in order to take into account the delaying effect of harsh environment on the emergency response time 9 log 10 τ j c j 1 h e s d j where τ j is the time needed to perform the generic j th operation described in fig 3b the logarithmic relationship has been adopted to scale the intervention time as a function of environmental conditions this allows introducing an increase in the response time even for a limited worsening of environmental conditions represented by hes score in order to calibrate the two coefficients c j and d j in eq 9 for each operation a time increment associated to harsh environmental conditions needs to be estimated according to fire brigade statistics published for cold weather areas of north america flynn 2009 us fire administration 2006 the time for each operation is doubled in harsh environmental conditions with respect to normal environment therefore hes equal to zero it is assumed for baseline values and hes equal to one for a doubling of times the baseline value for the time to alert τ 1 was set equal to 3 min landucci et al 2017 next eq 9 was applied to estimate the increment in τ 1 due to harsh conditions in offshore installations 10 log 10 τ 1 c 1 1 h e s d 1 in which c 1 0 699 and d 1 1 176 the coefficients were obtained applying the previously described procedure the increase of the time for external fire fighting intervention τ 5 is site specific and has to be evaluated based on the characteristics of the emergency response team characteristics the external intervention for offshore o g installation is provided by stand by safety vessels usually more than one vessel is available in the production field and for areas densely populated the vessels are normally shared among different installations and operators the time for vessel intervention depends on its distance from the facility and on its speeds in order to evaluate the emergency intervention time specific field information is required as the distance depends on the facility location the vessel speed is strongly influenced by meteorological parameters as the wave height and the wind intensity adverse meteorological conditions result in delays in order to keep the present approach conservative the logarithmic relationship used to evaluate the possible vessel intervention delay according to eq 9 is tuned considering two extreme conditions the collection and analysis of specific meteorological data is necessary to identify the worst and best case scenarios the first one is characterized by lower vessel velocities due to adverse meteorological conditions on the contrary in the best case scenario the vessel is fast and the time for approaching the installation is the lowest as the meteorological effects are negligible section 3 describes the procedure for the reference case considered 2 6 evaluation of escalation probability an eta assessment is adopted in this framework to evaluate the probability and frequency of cascading events triggered by fire eta approach is integrated with the quantitative analysis of barrier performance in order to assess how harsh environmental conditions ultimately affect the probability and frequency of domino scenarios the availability and effectiveness of safety protections evaluated as described in sections 2 3 and 2 4 is addressed in the eta by mean of dedicated logical gates a summary is shown in table 5 gate a represents a simple composite probability in this case the availability expressed in terms of pfd is multiplied by a single probability value expressing the probability of barrier success in the prevention of the escalation gate b represents a composite probability distribution in this case the pfd is multiplied by a probability distribution expressing the probability of barrier success in the prevention of escalation thus obtaining a composite probability of barrier failure on demand in this work the integrated probability is adopted obtaining the rule for gate quantification reported in table 5 gate c is associated with a discrete probability distribution finally gate d incorporates equipment vulnerability models based on probit approaches for the estimation of pd the probability of vessel failure the effect of harsh environmental conditions has been addressed in the probit models in describing the vessel resistance behaviour further detailed information on gates definition may be gathered in landucci et al 2015 2016 the failure probability of the target vessel pd is computed using vulnerability models based on probit functions see table 6 the higher the vessel resist to the external fire the lower the likelihood of failure and hence the escalation is less credible the vessel resistance may be expressed in terms of ttf which is the time lapse between the start of the external fire and the fired vessel failure induced by heat up and consequent pressurization birk and cunningham 1994 landucci et al 2009 higher ttf allows the intervention of external firefighting teams and then reducing probability of damage and escalation according to the approach suggested in previous works landucci et al 2009 the probit coefficient describing the vulnerability model are derived assuming log normal distribution of failure probability 90 probability of failure for ttf equal is associated to the time required to start the emergency operations onsite considered equal to the time to alert τ 1 in section 2 4 and 10 probability of failure for ttf is equal to the time to start the mitigation actions considered as the time for external firefighting intervention τ 2 in section 2 4 based on these assumptions it is possible to modify the probit coefficient accounting of delayed response times in harsh environment in section 4 2 the customized eta accounting of new gates described in this section is applied to the case study 3 case study description 3 1 overview the methodology described in section 2 is applied to a real case study located in harsh environment this will allow testing the potentialities of the present methodology in supporting detailed offshore risk assessment studies dedicated to the analysis of cascading events the installation selected for the case study is the goliat floating production storage and offloading fpso unit operating in the barents sea north of the arctic circle in the norwegian continent shelf goliat fpso is the largest and most complex circular shaped unit of its kind with a spread mooring system that prevents its rotation the layout considered of the case study is shown in fig 4 it has been defined according to standards hse health and safety executive 1992 and to general information available about goliat fpso eni norge 2016 fig 4 represents the process area of the installation the production risers from the subsea templates are conveyed to the production manifold vm01 in the process area the reservoirs at the goliat field kobbe and realgrunnen are classified as low pressure wells eni norge 2015 the manifold operating pressure is then assumed equal to 9 bar the oil from the manifold enters the low pressure separation train vs01 vs02 then it is stabilized and stored into dedicated tankers until it can be offloaded by means of specifically designed vessels the jet fire following the rupture of the manifold vm01 is considered as primary event affecting the target separator vs01 and potentially triggering the chain of cascading events in order to illustrate the methodology a rupture of 25 4 mm 1 american petroleum institute 2000 equivalent diameter at the manifold is considered a standard frequency of 3 36 10 7 1 year was assumed for the jet fire resulting as primary event the physical effects associated with the jet fire have been analyzed applying conventional literature integral models van den bosh and weterings 2005 implemented in the software dnv gl phast 7 11 the radiative heat load at the target separator due to the jet fire is shown in fig 4 it is worth noticing the serious hazard posed by jet fire scenarios in o g offshore installations lowesmith et al 2007 safety barriers are in place in order to protect the separator vs01 they are listed in table 1 and their performance assessment in normal and harsh environmental conditions is carried out in section 4 1 in order to exemplify the methodology obtaining conservative evaluations low quality equipment and protection devices are assumed for the considered facility hence z 1 z 2 1 in eq 3 see section 2 3 3 2 environmental and meteorological conditions goliat fpso operates in the periphery of the arctic region and the climatic conditions in that area are therefore more severe and cold than those normally experienced by offshore installation in the north sea table 7 summarizes the meteorological data concerning the barents sea gathered in order to exemplify the level of detail requested by the methodology as described in detail in section 2 for each data a penalty score s i is assigned according to table 7 the location of goliat fpso is remote from other communities the closest municipality is hammerfest in the norwegian county of finnmark it count around 10 000 citizens spread in a total of 848 km2 hammerfest kommune 2017 moreover the physical parameters of that area are inimical to human life thus for what concern the assessment of the remoteness stressor the capsule concept by suedfeld and steel 2000 has been assumed and the maximum score has been assigned 3 3 emergency firefighting response at the field the external emergency intervention at goliat field is provided by strill barents supply and stand by vessel under normal circumstances it operates mainly as supply vessel but it can provide first response in the case of emergency life saving intervention and oil spill situations eni norge 2017 fig 5 shows the strill barents vessel route from hammerfest to goliat field publicly available from marine traffic 2017 goliat emergency preparedness includes also another stand by safety vessel the esvagt aurora however this vessel has danish flag and its route covers the entire norwegian continent shelf and the danish water vessel finder 2017a for that reason in the present study only the presence and operation of the strill barent vessel were considered the response time depends on distance between the stand by vessel and the installation and on the speed of the vessel vessels are tracked by means of automatic identification system data as the latitude and longitude coordinates of the vessel its speed in different meteorological conditions and different time over the day are gathered from the vessel tracking service provider vessel finder 2017b data about vessel location in term of latitude and longitude and speed are provided from april 2016 to april 2017 with hourly time resolution the vessel velocity is affected by meteorological conditions and adverse weather may result in delay in intervention and deployment therefore in order to obtain safe side evaluations data were analyzed in order to determine two extreme weather conditions which have been considered in determining the logarithmic relationship for the delay in external emergency intervention due to harsh environment the two conditions are summarized in table 8 the increase of the time to emergency intervention τ 5 due to harsh conditions at goliat fpso is then obtained according to eq 7 following the same approach applied in the estimation of the time to alert τ 1 11 log 10 τ 5 0 228 1 h e s 0 864 where τ 5 is expressed in hours this relationship is that used for assessing emergency response effectiveness in the case study 4 results 4 1 performance assessment of safety barriers adverse meteorological conditions decrease sensitively the protection effect of safety devices on offshore o g installations in order to account for this effect the present methodology defines the hes a preliminary quantification of the harshness of the environment where the facility is operating applying the rules described in section 2 2 and the data reported in table 7 the hes equals as 0 81 a higher influence of waves is considered for this floating offshore installation a higher importance has been given to the remoteness stressor the hes value decreases up to almost 10 if the installation is moved to an area where services and supplier are easily available i e if it could not be considered as remote hes is then implemented to evaluate the performance of the safety barriers associated with vs01 and identified in section 2 in order to compare the results of the present analysis data were also calculated for normal environmental conditions e g hes 0 landucci et al 2015 data for hes 0 81 are modified according to the rules described in section 2 since the evaluated hes is higher than 0 60 also hardware barriers performance is modified table 9 shows also the gates associated to each barrier applied in the customized eta for the sake of comparison the case study is examined in absence of safety barriers following the approach suggested in landucci et al 2009 to which the reader is referred for more details 4 2 evaluation of escalation probability the customized eta was carried out on the basis of the frequency and consequence assessment of the primary scenario i e the jet fire from the production manifold vm01 affecting the horizontal separator vs01 fig 6 shows the eta developed for the case study analysis for hes 0 81 an event tree with a similar structure was developed also for the case with hes 0 the eta starts from the primary fire and allows accounting for the effect protection layers through the different gates two gate types are used to model the barriers associated with the separator vs01 and summarized in table 9 namely gates a and c see table 5 for gates details in particular all the hardware barriers i e water deluge system emergency shut down pressure safety valve and fireproofing are modeled with gate type a thus in this case a simple composite probability is obtained through the multiplication of barrier pfd and a single probability value of effectiveness η quantitative data are summarized in table 9 on the other hand emergency response is associated with a gate type c thus assuming a discrete probability distribution with three possible final outcomes described in the following their probability is estimated based on the comparison of the emergency team response time expressed through tfm and ttf in case the hardware barriers ensure a sufficient time lapse for intervention thus ttf tfm and emergency response is available the escalation is avoided this case is labeled in fig 6 as no escalation hence barriers completely and effectively mitigate the primary fire effect avoiding the separator failure in case one or more hardware barriers are successfully activated but do not provide a sufficient time lapse for intervention thus ttf tfm the emergency intervention is not able to prevent the escalation however the activated safety barriers allow reducing the impact of the consequences following the eventual rupture of the target process unit thus resulting in a mitigated scenario see fig 6 finally the unmitigated scenario see fig 6 is obtained only in case all the considered safety barriers either hardware or procedural are ineffective and or unavailable clearly enough even in absence of safety barriers activation and mitigation the target equipment may withstand the fire conditions with no safety relevant consequences escalation is thus excluded also in these cases the latter situation and more in general the credibility of mechanical failure of the equipment given the status of safety barriers is assessed through the fragility gate d see landucci et al 2016 for more details on this gate type the mentioned scenarios were obtained and quantified either in normal hes 0 or harsh environment hes 0 81 the quantified eta allowed performing the probabilistic assessment of the escalation scenarios associated with the separator the overall results are shown in fig 7 in terms of escalation probability fig 7a and frequency or annual probability fig 7b as shown in fig 7 harsh environment has a significant effect on the overall performance of safety barriers and thus on the escalation probability and frequency in fact the probability thus the credibility of a successful escalation prevention is reduced by a factor 1 8 in harsh environment with respect to normal conditions however in both cases the presence of multiple layers of protection which are required by commonly applied industrial standards in offshore o g facilities see section 2 2 allow for relevant risk reduction due to the low probability of unmitigated events given the primary scenario lower than 5 10 4 on the contrary if barriers are not accounted for in the analysis the escalation features an almost unitary probability of occurrence with a resulting frequency which is thus close to the frequency of the primary event therefore the adoption of sound mitigation measures is of utmost importance to achieve effective risk reduction 5 discussion the case study proves the methodology potential for considering harsh environmental conditions in the analysis of fire domino scenarios within offshore installations the results provided in section 4 show the significant decrease in availability of barriers due to difficult environmental conditions moreover the results show how decreased barrier availability may affect the frequency of escalation events the reduced effectiveness of emergency response team intervention due to delayed operations in harsh environment leads to a significant increase of the escalation frequency the time for external intervention in harsh conditions is almost twice the value in normal environment this is due to the vessel speed reduction due to waves and wind resistance and a lowered visibility due to fog and or snow and darkness considering the barrier performance criticalities within the design of equipment and of procedures for facilities operating in extreme environments is preferable to the detailed assessment of the risk picture these criticalities are considered in the phm cox 1972 and are due for instance to the poor selection of equipment resistance or delayed or poor maintenance and inspection due to harsh environment conditions similarly organizational and operational safety measures are affected by adverse environmental conditions and their performance may be considerably reduced due to difficulties in completing procedures or in the deployment of needed equipment and resources this barrier performance depletion is addressed using the hes in the present study different weights were assigned to each factor according to the zipf s law stability of the estimated hes has been proved through a sensitivity analysis based on monte carlo simulations the weights assigned to external factors have been changed considering an increment or decrement of 70 with respect to their reference value a total of 105 iterations were performed fig 8 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis the hes estimated for this analysis case study 0 81 falls in the expected range of the box plot fig 8a and is among the most frequent results in the count distribution fig 8b the zipf s law may thus be considered as a suitable starting point in defining the weighing system however the use of experts elicitation may support more accurate and case specific considerations to achieve a more specific weight assignment the escalation frequency obtained from the eta analysis section 2 6 may be implemented in the quantitative risk assessment framework to obtain a detailed risk picture including such escalation scenarios most of the input data required by the proposed methodology are available from conventional qra studies and no additional work is required from data collection the methodology allows for the analysis of safety barriers contribution to the reduction of fire escalation risk despite the results obtained may be expected from a qualitative point of view the quantification of probability and frequency through the present approach provides a useful support for decision making related to the choice of protection strategies firstly the method allows verifying the effect of risk reduction obtained by the commonly installed protection systems adopted in offshore facilities as suggested by technical standards and engineering practice see section 2 2 secondarily the methodology allows accounting for the effect of harsh meteorological conditions thus providing a worst case evaluation on the system response when environmental factors may play a key role in depleting the protection response this may support site managers in prioritizing resources for maintenance inspection components selection etc for the more critical safety barriers thirdly the effect of emergency response on the risk picture of an offshore installation may be verified through the present approach and eventually optimal response strategies may be derived to reduce the credibility of escalation scenarios it is worth reminding that the present approach is aimed at estimating domino frequency values associated with each single piece of equipment despite the fact that characterization of harsh environmental conditions and associated score affects the facility as a whole thus the analysis may be costly and it is recommended to screen among process units in order to apply the method only to the most critical items inherent safety based approaches such as the domino chain actual hazard index technique developed by cozzani et al 2009 may be applied to provide a preliminary screening of the target equipment resulting in a simpler approach demanding for limited resources however relevant uncertainty may affect the results the estimation of the stand by safety vessel time of intervention is a critical point in the methodology the parameters of the method should be tailored accounting for site specific data and details about the management of emergency procedures for each facility considered nevertheless the site specificity of the methodology is implicit in the development and estimation of hes moreover the methodology addresses human factor and hardware deterioration phenomena straightforwardly although they are relatively complex and challenging tasks the method provides thus a preliminary assessment of domino escalation probability and frequency 6 conclusion the present study was aimed at developing a systematic approach for the quantitative assessment of cascading events affecting offshore o g installations the influence of harsh environment on barrier performance was considered through the implementation of dedicated scoring systems for external meteorological climate and behavioural factors based on expert judgment a specific assessment of emergency response times and intervention allowed obtaining an accurate evaluation of firefighting procedures and intervention in offshore remote location and their effect on risk the modified performance parameters of safety barriers allow a more detailed frequency assessment of escalation scenarios the outcome of the methodology may drive the design of hardware safety barriers in order to limit the likelihood of cascading events triggered by fire the analysis also highlights the need for a timely effective emergency response in order to decrease the risk profile of offshore facilities harsh conditions considerably affect the emergency response time and this results in lower safety level with respect to asset protection 
23414,fire in the topside production area of offshore oil and gas o g platforms has the potential to trigger cascading events and may lead to catastrophic consequences for operators environment and asset safety barriers such as hardware systems and emergency response are critical elements aimed at preventing the propagation of this type of scenarios harsh environmental conditions may strongly affect the integrity of protective equipment and significantly hinder an effective and timely emergency response with a consequent increase in the risk level the present study is aimed at developing a structured methodology to the quantitative performance assessment of safety barriers specifically addressing the analysis of offshore facilities operating in harsh and sensitive environment an expert judgment elicitation procedure is adopted to score external factors associated with harsh environmental conditions simplified relationships are established for availability and effectiveness evaluation of safety barriers in offshore o g platforms a dedicated framework is developed for the analysis of emergency response the approach is tested through the application to a case study aimed at the assessment of the influence of harsh environmental conditions on the risk due to cascading events in a reference offshore installation keywords harsh environment major accident hazard offshore oil gas installations safety barriers cascading events 1 introduction in the last decades energy request has been increasing due to a continuous economic and social progress although renewable resources are increasingly developed according to the international energy agency the primary energy resource is still fossil fuels and their demand is expected to grow by more than 35 in the period 2010 to 2040 iea international energy agency 2017 the raising energy demand drives oil gas o g exploration companies to search for novel reservoirs therefore exploration activities are moving towards arctic and sub arctic regions along the norwegian american and russian continental shelfs according to the united states geological survey 22 of world hydrocarbon reserves are contained in these areas www usgs gov the exploration of these areas started in the early 1960s national petroleum council 2015 however their harsh climate conditions entail undertakings and risks for drilling operations paltrinieri et al 2017a b the oil production in these areas encounters different challenges due to cold harsh climate wind snowfall darkness and sensitive environment with respect to pollution the weather may delay operations as well as maintenance activities and the remoteness of the installations may lead to logistic and emergency response problems besides severe legislative frameworks are in force for environmental protection norwegian environment agency 2011 poor experience in design and operations of arctic o g facilities within harsh environment and difficulties in emergency response and management may represent critical issues to overcome as bercha et al 2003 and gao et al 2010 affirm technical and operational performance of safety barriers are critical aspects to be addressed in these specific conditions the effect of the environment and external factors on systems reliability have been investigated in the past and several models are available in the literature such as the proportional hazard model phm cox 1972 or the accelerated failure time model kalbfleisch and prentice 2002 on the other hand innovative techniques for operational support may be applied to such scenarios landucci and paltrinieri 2016 paltrinieri et al 2017a b paltrinieri and khan 2016 systems maintainability is also affected by external environment maintenance relies on resources such as operators tools and equipment accessibility and testing in arctic conditions operators may delay or may be unable to perform maintenance activities remoteness may hinder the deployment of tools and equipment needed and these may result in overdue or inappropriate maintenance these issues were specifically addressed in the work by gao et al 2010 despite that risk based design enhancing safety of operations in harsh environment was discussed by several authors gao et al 2010 paik et al 2011 vinnem 2014 a comprehensive and systematic safety assessment is still lacking for accident scenarios associated with offshore o g facilities in harsh environment among the most critical accident scenarios which may affect o g extraction and production facilities fires and explosions may directly cause severe damage to human health and environment but also affect the structural integrity of the facility and asset in this latter case accidents may propagate among different equipment processing or storing hydrocarbons eventually leading to the amplification of consequences khakzad and reniers 2015 necci et al 2015 those scenarios are indicated as cascading or domino events cozzani and reniers 2013 and severely affected offshore o g installations e g piper alpha disaster july 1988 lord cullen 1990 and macondo blowout april 2010 bp 2010 and more in general the process industry cozzani and reniers 2013 in the last decades the hazards posed by cascading events inspired the development of different approaches aimed at accounting this event in risk analysis and management bagster and pitblado 1991 cozzani et al 2005 gledhill and lines 1998 more recent approaches proposed for cascading events triggered by fire assessment included monte carlo simulations abdolhamidzadeh et al 2010 simplified risk indexes cozzani et al 2009 zhang and chen 2011 and tools based on bayesian networks khakzad et al 2013 eventually accounting for analysis of safety barrier performance khakzad et al 2017 however none of the mentioned approaches addresses the influence of harsh environmental conditions on risk evaluation and possible prevention or mitigation associated with the performance of safety barriers a preliminary attempt to analyse cascading events triggered by fire in harsh environmental conditions was developed by landucci et al 2017 the authors improved a methodology for the quantitative assessment of safety barriers based on event tree analysis landucci et al 2016 2015 introducing the analysis of environmental effect on the performance of safety barriers accounting for external factors such as cold weather extreme snow wind or other meteorological conditions however the approach was primarily focused on the assessment of cascading event risk for onshore facilities without specific and detailed analysis to the peculiar aspects of emergency rescue and response in o g offshore installations therefore the present work addresses the need for a systematic framework for risk analysis of cascading events assessment and emergency response the focus is on the performance of safety barrier mitigating fired domino scenarios in offshore platforms and facilities the effects of harsh environmental conditions are included in the investigation in order to develop a comprehensive framework able to analyse how domino frequency or probability may vary due to external severe weather conditions the paper is structured as follows in section 2 a detailed overview of the developed methodology is provided a description of the case study installation and the meteorological characterization of the area where it operates are provided in section 3 results are presented in section 4 while section 5 discusses the overall findings conclusions are provided in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 overview the present work is based on a methodology aimed at evaluating the performance of safety barriers in o g facilities operating in offshore harsh environment fig 1 reports the flowchart of the methodology detailing the specific features the preliminary step of the methodology step 1 in fig 1 is aimed at the identification of safety barriers that are installed on offshore o g installations in order to prevent and or mitigate the occurrence of cascading events barriers are identified according to specific standards and guidelines american petroleum institute 2007a hse health and safety executive 1992 iso international standardization organization 1999 psa 2013 each safety barrier is characterized by protection performance parameters in order to support further steps for the quantitative characterization in step 2 see fig 1 a harsh environmental score namely hes is determined based on a weighted combination of penalties associated with external climate and environmental factors e g cold temperatures wind waves snowfall etc in this step a specific elicitation process and a novel aggregation procedure is adopted to reduce the uncertainties in the methodology the so evaluated hes is applied in step 3 see fig 1 in order to determine the quantitative parameters related to the performance of the safety barriers in harsh environment the safety barriers performance is expressed in terms of i availability i e the capability of the barrier to respond on demand and ii effectiveness i e the capability of the barrier to effectively mitigate or prevent an escalation scenario once activated landucci et al 2015 2016 it is worth noticing that the definition of availability provided in this framework has been proven to be in line with the aramis project dianous and de fiévez 2006 definition of level of confidence while the definition of effectiveness includes both definitions of effectiveness and response time of the aramis project both availability and effectiveness are influenced by the harsh environmental conditions and hes is adopted to tailor these parameters for the location under analysis an aspect that constitutes a relevant element of novelty in the present work is related to the detailed performance analysis of emergency response time specific for offshore platforms which to the best of our knowledge was never undertaken before in the framework of cascading events analysis finally the safety barrier performance data obtained are implemented in an event tree analysis based on specific gates for the analysis of fire induced cascading events in order to determine the annual probability of escalation scenarios step 4 in fig 1 2 2 identification and characterization of reference safety barriers control and mitigation of fires and explosions in o g offshore facilities is ruled by different standards and guidelines american petroleum institute 2007a 2007b hse health and safety executive 1992 iso international standardization organization 1999 which are hereby taken as basis to identify the required safety measures according to ccps center of chemical process safety 2000 barriers are classified as passive protections which are already in place and do not require external activation active protections which require automatic external activation procedural and emergency measures which involve the intervention of operators and emergency teams several pieces of equipment are installed on offshore installations featuring different sets of protection systems hse hse health and safety executive 1992 a synthetic and comprehensive set of reference safety barriers for offshore installations are determined landucci et al 2015 in particular inherent safety analysis allowed performing a screening among the process units typically installed in extraction and production offshore o g sites the domino actual hazard index cozzani et al 2013 2009 has been applied in this analysis it is a method based on the identification of penalties for process equipment and to the calculation of a dedicated index describing the criticality of each item to domino escalation scenarios the procedure has been applied to the different process area equipment the first stage horizontal separator was identified as the most critical unit for domino effect propagation and thus it was taken as reference unit then according to hse hse health and safety executive 1992 the safety barriers associated to this type of equipment were identified and constitute the object of the present analysis the selected safety barriers are summarized in table 1 it is worth to noticing that only the systems relevant for domino prevention are listed below as shown in table 1 two types of active fire protection systems are considered a systems for the delivery of fire fighting agents such as water or water based foam which are designed among other functions to mitigate fire exposure of the target norsok 2008 b emergency isolation systems through shutdown which is designed to isolate a target unit reducing the potential loss and consequent damage connected to the large inventory in the framework of escalation prevention the application of fireproofing materials constitutes a relevant and effective passive safety barrier aimed at delaying fire heating fireproofing is often combined with emergency relief systems in order to limit the vessel pressure build up due to the liquid temperature increase american petroleum institute api 1999 sci steel construction institute 1992 finally procedural and emergency measures include the relevant operating procedures with respect to escalation prevention and to support the coordinated response to a major accident scenario for offshore installations the emergency response consists in both actions taken from personnel on board to contain and or control the hazard and actions carried out by trained personnel approaching the facility from the safety and rescue vessels a survey of performance data for safety barriers summarized in table 1 was carried out in a previous work in which a specific data repository was built landucci et al 2015 these performance data are hereby taken as initial reference to support the analysis of safety barrier performance in harsh environment conditions active fire protections are complex systems and their availability expressed in terms of pfd probability of failure on demand is evaluated using fault tree analysis where dependencies and common cause of failures are addressed through the beta factor method schueller 1997 the successful application of active fire protection does not guarantee the prevention of escalation hence the evaluation of system effectiveness through quantitative parameters is required passive fire protections can be considered as single components and then their availability is derived conservatively from specific literature national fire protection agency nfpa 2009 2 3 definition of harsh environment score hes 2 3 1 hes evaluation approach in order to assess the influence of harsh environment indications about the influence of different site specific environmental parameters such as temperature wind and waves height are combined in order to define the harsh environmental score hes in sight of indexes for extreme meteorological conditions such as the severe weather threat index sweat miller 1972 and the severe thunderstorm index sti maglaras and lapenta 1997 the hes is defined as a weighted summation of the atmospheric parameters and it represents a preliminary metric to assess the harshness of the environment where the facility is located hes is used to consider the influence of environmental conditions on barrier performance as explained in sections 2 4 and 2 5 fig 2 shows the hierarchical evaluation process for hes according to landucci et al 2017 to which the reader is referred for more details 2 3 2 definition of stressors and penalties the approach for the evaluation of hes shown in fig 2 is based on the identification of stressors stressors are factors that mostly affect the human performance in operations in extreme weather conditions a generic taxonomy of stressors is provided by kim and jung 2003 musharraf et al 2013 analyse the most relevant stressors in harsh environment according to previous works from bercha 2006 and bercha et al 2003 according to these studies the significant stressors in harsh environments are coldness or warmth ice slippery difficulty in breathing combined weather effect low visibility and remoteness to each stressor one or more external factors ef are associated efs are climate or environmental conditions that can be measured or quantified for the site under analysis and that have a significant impact on the correspondent stressor a non dimensional penalty s is assigned to each ef this represents the distance from favourable environmental conditions and it scores from 0 to 1 where 0 represents the good conditions and 1 the worst ones penalties are then combined according to the rules described in section 2 3 3 specific environmental conditions of the site of interest should be collected while assigning the penalties the penalty increases the relevance of the ef for the case study under analysis the overview of stressors external factors and penalty system applied in the present study is provided in table 2 the parameters aimed at determining the ef score are ranked in order to assess the effect of adverse meteorological conditions on plant operation performance the ranges of the parameter are derived from literature survey and documented elsewhere landucci et al 2017 the weather parameters used are average values over a year the aim of the hes is to describe to some extent the harshness of the environment where the installation is located it is not meant to describe the condition at a given point in time e g today the following sections report the main highlights about the effect of each external factor on human performance and about the penalty system adopted in table 2 cold weather inhibits operator s performance inducing difficulty in breathing or slippery due to ice musharraf et al 2013 in recommended practices rp 581 from american petroleum institute 2000 specific penalties are associated to operation in cold environments on the basis of the external temperature external factor 1 these penalties as shown in table 2 are adapted in this framework a further penalty is considered in the presence of hot weather conditions when the temperature is higher than the one representing tropical ambient conditions 45 c iacs international association of classification societies 1978 wind affects human and objects the beaufort wind force scale shaw and austin 1919 is considered in this framework in order to account of the ef2 extreme wind speed the scale identifies 13 classes associated to different beaufort numbers from force 0 to force 12 the intermediate levels are identified according to a linearly increasing behaviour with respect to the wind speed at 10 m above sea level each class represents different sea and land conditions the present work considers the scale up to force 8 defined as gale in this condition the operators walking against the wind feel inconvenience on offshore installations the edges are the critical areas exposed to high wind the process area is conventionally protected against external wind anyway strong wind may significantly affect the safety vessel response and the operations carried out by the emergency crew then it is a factor that should be taken into account in the present analysis conservatively the present framework assigns the unitary penalty to the gale condition and no penalty is considered below the light breeze condition force 2 in beaufort scale the intermediate wind speed ranges are scored with penalties linearly increasing from 0 to 1 shaw and austin 1919 waves ef3 may generates seasickness on offshore operators the effect of waves is different on different type of installations for example fixed installations do not experience at all any problem due to the state of the sea the situation is critical for floating units both processing installations and supply vessels the parameter considered in assessing the severity of wave conditions is the significant wave height i e the average of the higher one third of the waves considering a stated sea surface and ordering the waves for increasing height according to pafa consulting engineers 2001 the critical waves height resulting in adverse sea state is in the range of 3 4 m then the maximum penalty is associated to waves exceeding 4 m height the classification of severity classes for waves according to douglas sea scale pafa consulting engineers 2001 is adopted in order to identify the ranges of heights and to associate them a penalty douglas scale identifies ten degrees of severity for wave conditions with nearly logarithmic increment with respect to wave height no penalty is associated with calm sea condition i e wave height less than 0 1 m snow load ef4 may limit operator movements in offshore installation the parameter adopted in quantifying its effect is the snowfall i e the depth of snow that accumulate between an observation and another one in order to penalize snowfall on human performance the scoring system is based on the classes of annual snowfall identified by kunkel et al 2007 the scale identifies three classes of severity for snowfall precipitation the maximum penalty is assigned for precipitation higher than 2 m year while no penalty is considered for snowfall lower than 0 125 m year intermediate values are defined according to a linearly increasing law visibility may be reduced due to the combined effect of fog and snow ef5 and sunlight hours ef6 it is a critical factor for emergency intervention and platform rescue and evacuation limited visibility may delay significantly these operations and it may lead to severe scenarios the metric for visibility penalization due to fog and snow is determined according to visibility table from supplementary surface weather report suprep code by doa department of army 1982 the minimum visibility range in suprep code is associate to the maximum penalty e g 1 a logarithmic decreasing penalty is associated to intermediate visibility classes no penalty is associate to visibility equal or higher than the typical maximum extension of an industrial facility in order to assess the visibility reduction due to darkness the climatological indicator sunshine duration is adopted it measures the cumulative time during which an area receives direct irradiance from the sun for at least 120 w m2 the ranges for sunlight hours in a given location are defined according to the categorization by landsberg and pinna 1978 the maximum penalty is assumed for these area with the minimum range of annual sunshine hours while no penalties is considered in locations with ordinary sunlight duration i e one third of the total time as annual average the remoteness factor ef7 in table 2 is associated with fear and homesickness musharraf et al 2013 due to relevant uncertainties in measuring the impact of remoteness on human behaviour the framework adopts a semi quantitative approach in case the analyst deems that this aspect is critical a unitary penalty is assigned an intermediate score e g 0 5 may be also assigned in case the analyst deems relevant to consider this factor at medium priority while a null score is assigned otherwise 2 3 3 penalties aggregation once the penalties s are associated to each of the n external factors relevant for the case under analysis hes is evaluated as a weighted summation as follows 1 h e s i 1 n w i s i where s i and w i are respectively the score and the weight associated to the i th ef the choice of the weighted summation for penalties aggregation is in accordance with a previous work landucci et al 2017 weights are assigned in order to associate a different level of importance within each ef or eventually to exclude those that are not relevant for the case study weights are assigned to each ef and they are representative of the judgement of the assessor also on the basis of interviews with workers and managers of the company operating facility zipf s law has been adopted in order to obtain a preliminary set of weights zipf 1949 a simplified version of zipf s law predicts that out of a population of n elements the frequency of elements of rank j called f j n is 2 f j n 1 j n 1 n 1 j n the efs are ranked in five classes according to the judgement of the assessor and also on the basis of interviews with workers and managers operating on offshore floating units table 3 shows the ranking of the efs obtained from experts elicitation and adopted in this framework efs classified in the higher ranks 1 2 are those judged as more critical on the basis of the ranking defined for offshore installations weights are assigned to each ef as shown in table 3 2 4 hardware barrier performance assessment extreme environmental conditions may seriously affect the availability of hardware components gao et al 2010 both active and passive barriers may deteriorate due to cold erosion wind snow and ice with significant worsening of their protective performance in this study it is assumed that harsh environment seriously affect barrier availability while no significant effects are associated to the effectiveness gao et al 2010 according to the recommended practices rp 581 by the american petroleum institute 2000 the depletion of barrier performance in harsh conditions is strictly related to environmental temperature in particular environmental temperature may affect barrier availability when its values is below a given threshold value of 6 7 c american petroleum institute 2000 this value corresponds to a penalty for external temperature s1 in table 2 equal to 0 6 in this framework we assumed that for s1 lower than 0 6 no relevant performance modifications are accounted and data for safety barriers operating in normal environment may be adopted see e g the data repository reported by landucci et al 2015 for s1 higher than 0 6 depletion of barrier availability in arctic environment is addressed using the phm cox 1972 as suggested by gao et al 2010 the approach modifies the failure rate of a generic component λ in case of harsh environment as 3 λ z λ 0 e 1 409 z 1 1 013 z 2 where λ 0 is the baseline failure rate in normal environment assumed as constant during the lifecycle of the facility and z 1 and z 2 are the covariates assumed as binary described in table 4 in order to obtain baseline failure rates value λ 0 a pfd data repository for the considered barrier is needed landucci et al 2015 an equivalent failure rate was derived by applying the base relationship for the estimation of tested component unavailability lees 1996 to p f d 0 the baseline failure rate is then 4 p f d 1 2 λ θ λ 0 2 p f d 0 θ 0 where θ 0 is the baseline test interval assumed equal to 1 year 8760 h for industrial facility located in normal environment eq 1 is then applied to calculate the modified failure rate λ z and then the pfd in harsh environment may be calculated according to the previous eq 4 in this case a modified test interval θ is considered in order to take into account of delays in maintenance operations less frequent shutdowns due to difficulties in accessing the area or difficulties in performing tests that harsh environment may involve such problems are accounted by an increase of test interval based on the information gathered for the facility under analysis the test interval is set as 10000 h in harsh environmental conditions in the present work it is assumed that cold environment does not affect the effectiveness of active barriers once activated see landucci et al 2017 for more details therefore the effectiveness associated with the active safety barriers listed in table 1 may be considered as in the case of normal environment landucci et al 2015 the effectiveness of the water deluge system wds01 is determined based on the outcomes of experimental studies hankinson and lowesmith 2004 roberts 2004a 2004b shirvill 2004 on pressurized vessels engulfed by fire in which the reduction in the incident thermal radiation due to wds was evaluated these studies allowed defining a numerical parameter namely intensity reduction factor ϕ in order to quantify the wds effectiveness ϕ represents the reduction in heat load q h l due to the presence of the activated wds based on the numerical results of the experimental studies ϕ has been selected as 0 50 the heat load q w d s in case of available wds indicates wds performance and is obtained as 5 q w d s φ q h l the emergency shut down esd system is activated to stop the leakage that feeds the primary fire scenario the effectiveness of the esd is related to the maximum response time of the system in case of successful activation it is assumed that the esd system isolate the leak within 3 min with unitary effectiveness landucci et al 2015 passive safety protections include pressure safety valve psv and fireproofing coatings the presence of the psv alone is proved birk 2006 not to be sufficient to significantly delay the time to failure ttf of the target equipment in this case the effectiveness is considered as unitary but the ttf is evaluated using the unprotected vessel correlation fireproofing coatings are able to delay the vessel failure in case of availability of this protection a unitary effectiveness is assumed in this framework the ttf of the unprotected target equipment is added by a further term namely ttfc representing the delay action of the coating ttfc is evaluated according to a simplified approach if high performance materials designed to specifically withstand severe fire conditions are adopted intumescent vermiculite spray fibrous mineral wool the ttfc is assumed conservatively as 70 min if common insulating materials glass wool rock wool are used as protection the ttfc is set equal to 0 min considering inadequate the fireproofing protections in delaying the target failure further details are provided in section 2 5 2 5 emergency response performance assessment musharraf et al 2013 point out how human reliability may be significantly affected by extreme weather causing the increment of pfd of emergency barriers where human interventions are involved and possible delays in deployment and operations the decrement in the availability increment of pfd of the emergency response in harsh environment is estimated based on the framework proposed in the success likelihood index methodology slim method embrey 1986 slim is a technique used for assessing human error probability in the framework of tasks based on procedures a set of performance shaping factors psf is defined for each task and for each psf the assessor is requested to assign a weight the combination of psfs is defined as success likelihood index sli ranging from zero to one sli approaching one represents a situation close to the ideal conditions in performing the task sli is converted to human pfd according to 6 log 10 p f d a 0 s l i b 0 where a 0 and b 0 are determined assuming two known values of pfd corresponding to sli 0 and sli 1 embrey 1986 in the present methodology the hes defined in section 2 3 is assumed as a simplified ranking of the psfs affecting the emergency response in harsh environments landucci et al 2017 the higher the hes value the lower the likelihood of success for the emergency response task eq 6 is then modified as 7 log 10 p f d a 1 h e s b where a and b are respectively 0 954 and 0 046 and they are determined on the basis of the following assumptions in the case of favourable environmental conditions hes 0 the pfd is set equal to 0 1 according to standards from the emergency team intervention landucci et al 2015 in the case of worst environmental conditions hes 1 the pfd is set equal to 0 9 as a conservative maximum human error probability musharraf et al 2013 for the evaluation of emergency intervention effectiveness a specific approach was developed for offshore installations the effectiveness of the emergency response is quantified by defining a time scale for emergency intervention landucci et al 2015 a specific metric namely time for final mitigation tfm is defined tfm is the characteristic time for the effective intervention of the external emergency teams and it is defined as the maximum time needed to primary fire suppression or effective cooling action on the target equipment the present approach details a specific time scale for emergency intervention in manned offshore facilities on the basis of norsok standard z 013 norsok 2010 fig 3 a graphically represents the different phases involved in offshore external emergency response the emergency intervention time scale is described in the following five different phases time to alert τ 1 it is the maximum time required to start emergency operations it is defined as the time needed for the primary fire to be detected and the alarm to be given onsite alerting personnel on board and offsite activation of external emergency response time for mustering τ 2 it is the time needed for on board personnel to reach the temporary refugee tr that usually acts as mustering point during the mustering phase information about the primary fire are collected and provided to the operators in the control room time for onsite mitigation τ 3 it is the time needed by expert on board personnel for carrying out control actions in that phase the personnel on board not involved in this operations starts the evacuation in the case the escalation is considered likely to occur time for evacuation and rescue τ 4 it is the time needed for reaching the lifeboats by both expert and other personnel the rescue is considered completed when the lifeboats enter the safe area time for external firefighting intervention τ 5 it is the time needed by the stand by vessel to approach the installation and extinguish the primary fire and cooling the target equipment it is worth noticing that the main aim of emergency intervention in manned installation is the safe rescue of personnel while the purpose of this framework is to evaluate the safety of assets in the presence of fire scenarios potentially escalating in domino event for this reason τ 5 is included in the analysis unlike in the norsok standard norsok 2010 the tfm with respect to asset safety is then defined as the summation of operations times τ i as follows 8 t f m τ 1 τ 5 fig 3b provides a graphical representation of the time scale for sake of clarity the tfm is compared with the ttf of the target equipment while assessing the emergency response effectiveness landucci et al 2015 the effectiveness is set as unitary when tfm is lower than ttf in normal conditions the time to alarm τ 1 value in an offshore facility is assumed equal to 3 min baseline value the time for external intervention τ 5 depends on site specific characteristics and on the vessel policy adopted by the company the baseline value depends on the distance between the shore and the installation and it should be assessed for the facility under analysis in favourable meteorological conditions an example is provided in the case study section of this work harsh conditions may seriously affect the tfm with possible delay associated for instance to increased deployment time difficulties in reaching remote locations or difficult in operations detailed studies on emergency service response time on land are available in the literature based on statistical analyses devoted to fire brigade response taylor 2016 and emergency medical service matteson et al 2011 in the present study the following relationship is adopted in order to take into account the delaying effect of harsh environment on the emergency response time 9 log 10 τ j c j 1 h e s d j where τ j is the time needed to perform the generic j th operation described in fig 3b the logarithmic relationship has been adopted to scale the intervention time as a function of environmental conditions this allows introducing an increase in the response time even for a limited worsening of environmental conditions represented by hes score in order to calibrate the two coefficients c j and d j in eq 9 for each operation a time increment associated to harsh environmental conditions needs to be estimated according to fire brigade statistics published for cold weather areas of north america flynn 2009 us fire administration 2006 the time for each operation is doubled in harsh environmental conditions with respect to normal environment therefore hes equal to zero it is assumed for baseline values and hes equal to one for a doubling of times the baseline value for the time to alert τ 1 was set equal to 3 min landucci et al 2017 next eq 9 was applied to estimate the increment in τ 1 due to harsh conditions in offshore installations 10 log 10 τ 1 c 1 1 h e s d 1 in which c 1 0 699 and d 1 1 176 the coefficients were obtained applying the previously described procedure the increase of the time for external fire fighting intervention τ 5 is site specific and has to be evaluated based on the characteristics of the emergency response team characteristics the external intervention for offshore o g installation is provided by stand by safety vessels usually more than one vessel is available in the production field and for areas densely populated the vessels are normally shared among different installations and operators the time for vessel intervention depends on its distance from the facility and on its speeds in order to evaluate the emergency intervention time specific field information is required as the distance depends on the facility location the vessel speed is strongly influenced by meteorological parameters as the wave height and the wind intensity adverse meteorological conditions result in delays in order to keep the present approach conservative the logarithmic relationship used to evaluate the possible vessel intervention delay according to eq 9 is tuned considering two extreme conditions the collection and analysis of specific meteorological data is necessary to identify the worst and best case scenarios the first one is characterized by lower vessel velocities due to adverse meteorological conditions on the contrary in the best case scenario the vessel is fast and the time for approaching the installation is the lowest as the meteorological effects are negligible section 3 describes the procedure for the reference case considered 2 6 evaluation of escalation probability an eta assessment is adopted in this framework to evaluate the probability and frequency of cascading events triggered by fire eta approach is integrated with the quantitative analysis of barrier performance in order to assess how harsh environmental conditions ultimately affect the probability and frequency of domino scenarios the availability and effectiveness of safety protections evaluated as described in sections 2 3 and 2 4 is addressed in the eta by mean of dedicated logical gates a summary is shown in table 5 gate a represents a simple composite probability in this case the availability expressed in terms of pfd is multiplied by a single probability value expressing the probability of barrier success in the prevention of the escalation gate b represents a composite probability distribution in this case the pfd is multiplied by a probability distribution expressing the probability of barrier success in the prevention of escalation thus obtaining a composite probability of barrier failure on demand in this work the integrated probability is adopted obtaining the rule for gate quantification reported in table 5 gate c is associated with a discrete probability distribution finally gate d incorporates equipment vulnerability models based on probit approaches for the estimation of pd the probability of vessel failure the effect of harsh environmental conditions has been addressed in the probit models in describing the vessel resistance behaviour further detailed information on gates definition may be gathered in landucci et al 2015 2016 the failure probability of the target vessel pd is computed using vulnerability models based on probit functions see table 6 the higher the vessel resist to the external fire the lower the likelihood of failure and hence the escalation is less credible the vessel resistance may be expressed in terms of ttf which is the time lapse between the start of the external fire and the fired vessel failure induced by heat up and consequent pressurization birk and cunningham 1994 landucci et al 2009 higher ttf allows the intervention of external firefighting teams and then reducing probability of damage and escalation according to the approach suggested in previous works landucci et al 2009 the probit coefficient describing the vulnerability model are derived assuming log normal distribution of failure probability 90 probability of failure for ttf equal is associated to the time required to start the emergency operations onsite considered equal to the time to alert τ 1 in section 2 4 and 10 probability of failure for ttf is equal to the time to start the mitigation actions considered as the time for external firefighting intervention τ 2 in section 2 4 based on these assumptions it is possible to modify the probit coefficient accounting of delayed response times in harsh environment in section 4 2 the customized eta accounting of new gates described in this section is applied to the case study 3 case study description 3 1 overview the methodology described in section 2 is applied to a real case study located in harsh environment this will allow testing the potentialities of the present methodology in supporting detailed offshore risk assessment studies dedicated to the analysis of cascading events the installation selected for the case study is the goliat floating production storage and offloading fpso unit operating in the barents sea north of the arctic circle in the norwegian continent shelf goliat fpso is the largest and most complex circular shaped unit of its kind with a spread mooring system that prevents its rotation the layout considered of the case study is shown in fig 4 it has been defined according to standards hse health and safety executive 1992 and to general information available about goliat fpso eni norge 2016 fig 4 represents the process area of the installation the production risers from the subsea templates are conveyed to the production manifold vm01 in the process area the reservoirs at the goliat field kobbe and realgrunnen are classified as low pressure wells eni norge 2015 the manifold operating pressure is then assumed equal to 9 bar the oil from the manifold enters the low pressure separation train vs01 vs02 then it is stabilized and stored into dedicated tankers until it can be offloaded by means of specifically designed vessels the jet fire following the rupture of the manifold vm01 is considered as primary event affecting the target separator vs01 and potentially triggering the chain of cascading events in order to illustrate the methodology a rupture of 25 4 mm 1 american petroleum institute 2000 equivalent diameter at the manifold is considered a standard frequency of 3 36 10 7 1 year was assumed for the jet fire resulting as primary event the physical effects associated with the jet fire have been analyzed applying conventional literature integral models van den bosh and weterings 2005 implemented in the software dnv gl phast 7 11 the radiative heat load at the target separator due to the jet fire is shown in fig 4 it is worth noticing the serious hazard posed by jet fire scenarios in o g offshore installations lowesmith et al 2007 safety barriers are in place in order to protect the separator vs01 they are listed in table 1 and their performance assessment in normal and harsh environmental conditions is carried out in section 4 1 in order to exemplify the methodology obtaining conservative evaluations low quality equipment and protection devices are assumed for the considered facility hence z 1 z 2 1 in eq 3 see section 2 3 3 2 environmental and meteorological conditions goliat fpso operates in the periphery of the arctic region and the climatic conditions in that area are therefore more severe and cold than those normally experienced by offshore installation in the north sea table 7 summarizes the meteorological data concerning the barents sea gathered in order to exemplify the level of detail requested by the methodology as described in detail in section 2 for each data a penalty score s i is assigned according to table 7 the location of goliat fpso is remote from other communities the closest municipality is hammerfest in the norwegian county of finnmark it count around 10 000 citizens spread in a total of 848 km2 hammerfest kommune 2017 moreover the physical parameters of that area are inimical to human life thus for what concern the assessment of the remoteness stressor the capsule concept by suedfeld and steel 2000 has been assumed and the maximum score has been assigned 3 3 emergency firefighting response at the field the external emergency intervention at goliat field is provided by strill barents supply and stand by vessel under normal circumstances it operates mainly as supply vessel but it can provide first response in the case of emergency life saving intervention and oil spill situations eni norge 2017 fig 5 shows the strill barents vessel route from hammerfest to goliat field publicly available from marine traffic 2017 goliat emergency preparedness includes also another stand by safety vessel the esvagt aurora however this vessel has danish flag and its route covers the entire norwegian continent shelf and the danish water vessel finder 2017a for that reason in the present study only the presence and operation of the strill barent vessel were considered the response time depends on distance between the stand by vessel and the installation and on the speed of the vessel vessels are tracked by means of automatic identification system data as the latitude and longitude coordinates of the vessel its speed in different meteorological conditions and different time over the day are gathered from the vessel tracking service provider vessel finder 2017b data about vessel location in term of latitude and longitude and speed are provided from april 2016 to april 2017 with hourly time resolution the vessel velocity is affected by meteorological conditions and adverse weather may result in delay in intervention and deployment therefore in order to obtain safe side evaluations data were analyzed in order to determine two extreme weather conditions which have been considered in determining the logarithmic relationship for the delay in external emergency intervention due to harsh environment the two conditions are summarized in table 8 the increase of the time to emergency intervention τ 5 due to harsh conditions at goliat fpso is then obtained according to eq 7 following the same approach applied in the estimation of the time to alert τ 1 11 log 10 τ 5 0 228 1 h e s 0 864 where τ 5 is expressed in hours this relationship is that used for assessing emergency response effectiveness in the case study 4 results 4 1 performance assessment of safety barriers adverse meteorological conditions decrease sensitively the protection effect of safety devices on offshore o g installations in order to account for this effect the present methodology defines the hes a preliminary quantification of the harshness of the environment where the facility is operating applying the rules described in section 2 2 and the data reported in table 7 the hes equals as 0 81 a higher influence of waves is considered for this floating offshore installation a higher importance has been given to the remoteness stressor the hes value decreases up to almost 10 if the installation is moved to an area where services and supplier are easily available i e if it could not be considered as remote hes is then implemented to evaluate the performance of the safety barriers associated with vs01 and identified in section 2 in order to compare the results of the present analysis data were also calculated for normal environmental conditions e g hes 0 landucci et al 2015 data for hes 0 81 are modified according to the rules described in section 2 since the evaluated hes is higher than 0 60 also hardware barriers performance is modified table 9 shows also the gates associated to each barrier applied in the customized eta for the sake of comparison the case study is examined in absence of safety barriers following the approach suggested in landucci et al 2009 to which the reader is referred for more details 4 2 evaluation of escalation probability the customized eta was carried out on the basis of the frequency and consequence assessment of the primary scenario i e the jet fire from the production manifold vm01 affecting the horizontal separator vs01 fig 6 shows the eta developed for the case study analysis for hes 0 81 an event tree with a similar structure was developed also for the case with hes 0 the eta starts from the primary fire and allows accounting for the effect protection layers through the different gates two gate types are used to model the barriers associated with the separator vs01 and summarized in table 9 namely gates a and c see table 5 for gates details in particular all the hardware barriers i e water deluge system emergency shut down pressure safety valve and fireproofing are modeled with gate type a thus in this case a simple composite probability is obtained through the multiplication of barrier pfd and a single probability value of effectiveness η quantitative data are summarized in table 9 on the other hand emergency response is associated with a gate type c thus assuming a discrete probability distribution with three possible final outcomes described in the following their probability is estimated based on the comparison of the emergency team response time expressed through tfm and ttf in case the hardware barriers ensure a sufficient time lapse for intervention thus ttf tfm and emergency response is available the escalation is avoided this case is labeled in fig 6 as no escalation hence barriers completely and effectively mitigate the primary fire effect avoiding the separator failure in case one or more hardware barriers are successfully activated but do not provide a sufficient time lapse for intervention thus ttf tfm the emergency intervention is not able to prevent the escalation however the activated safety barriers allow reducing the impact of the consequences following the eventual rupture of the target process unit thus resulting in a mitigated scenario see fig 6 finally the unmitigated scenario see fig 6 is obtained only in case all the considered safety barriers either hardware or procedural are ineffective and or unavailable clearly enough even in absence of safety barriers activation and mitigation the target equipment may withstand the fire conditions with no safety relevant consequences escalation is thus excluded also in these cases the latter situation and more in general the credibility of mechanical failure of the equipment given the status of safety barriers is assessed through the fragility gate d see landucci et al 2016 for more details on this gate type the mentioned scenarios were obtained and quantified either in normal hes 0 or harsh environment hes 0 81 the quantified eta allowed performing the probabilistic assessment of the escalation scenarios associated with the separator the overall results are shown in fig 7 in terms of escalation probability fig 7a and frequency or annual probability fig 7b as shown in fig 7 harsh environment has a significant effect on the overall performance of safety barriers and thus on the escalation probability and frequency in fact the probability thus the credibility of a successful escalation prevention is reduced by a factor 1 8 in harsh environment with respect to normal conditions however in both cases the presence of multiple layers of protection which are required by commonly applied industrial standards in offshore o g facilities see section 2 2 allow for relevant risk reduction due to the low probability of unmitigated events given the primary scenario lower than 5 10 4 on the contrary if barriers are not accounted for in the analysis the escalation features an almost unitary probability of occurrence with a resulting frequency which is thus close to the frequency of the primary event therefore the adoption of sound mitigation measures is of utmost importance to achieve effective risk reduction 5 discussion the case study proves the methodology potential for considering harsh environmental conditions in the analysis of fire domino scenarios within offshore installations the results provided in section 4 show the significant decrease in availability of barriers due to difficult environmental conditions moreover the results show how decreased barrier availability may affect the frequency of escalation events the reduced effectiveness of emergency response team intervention due to delayed operations in harsh environment leads to a significant increase of the escalation frequency the time for external intervention in harsh conditions is almost twice the value in normal environment this is due to the vessel speed reduction due to waves and wind resistance and a lowered visibility due to fog and or snow and darkness considering the barrier performance criticalities within the design of equipment and of procedures for facilities operating in extreme environments is preferable to the detailed assessment of the risk picture these criticalities are considered in the phm cox 1972 and are due for instance to the poor selection of equipment resistance or delayed or poor maintenance and inspection due to harsh environment conditions similarly organizational and operational safety measures are affected by adverse environmental conditions and their performance may be considerably reduced due to difficulties in completing procedures or in the deployment of needed equipment and resources this barrier performance depletion is addressed using the hes in the present study different weights were assigned to each factor according to the zipf s law stability of the estimated hes has been proved through a sensitivity analysis based on monte carlo simulations the weights assigned to external factors have been changed considering an increment or decrement of 70 with respect to their reference value a total of 105 iterations were performed fig 8 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis the hes estimated for this analysis case study 0 81 falls in the expected range of the box plot fig 8a and is among the most frequent results in the count distribution fig 8b the zipf s law may thus be considered as a suitable starting point in defining the weighing system however the use of experts elicitation may support more accurate and case specific considerations to achieve a more specific weight assignment the escalation frequency obtained from the eta analysis section 2 6 may be implemented in the quantitative risk assessment framework to obtain a detailed risk picture including such escalation scenarios most of the input data required by the proposed methodology are available from conventional qra studies and no additional work is required from data collection the methodology allows for the analysis of safety barriers contribution to the reduction of fire escalation risk despite the results obtained may be expected from a qualitative point of view the quantification of probability and frequency through the present approach provides a useful support for decision making related to the choice of protection strategies firstly the method allows verifying the effect of risk reduction obtained by the commonly installed protection systems adopted in offshore facilities as suggested by technical standards and engineering practice see section 2 2 secondarily the methodology allows accounting for the effect of harsh meteorological conditions thus providing a worst case evaluation on the system response when environmental factors may play a key role in depleting the protection response this may support site managers in prioritizing resources for maintenance inspection components selection etc for the more critical safety barriers thirdly the effect of emergency response on the risk picture of an offshore installation may be verified through the present approach and eventually optimal response strategies may be derived to reduce the credibility of escalation scenarios it is worth reminding that the present approach is aimed at estimating domino frequency values associated with each single piece of equipment despite the fact that characterization of harsh environmental conditions and associated score affects the facility as a whole thus the analysis may be costly and it is recommended to screen among process units in order to apply the method only to the most critical items inherent safety based approaches such as the domino chain actual hazard index technique developed by cozzani et al 2009 may be applied to provide a preliminary screening of the target equipment resulting in a simpler approach demanding for limited resources however relevant uncertainty may affect the results the estimation of the stand by safety vessel time of intervention is a critical point in the methodology the parameters of the method should be tailored accounting for site specific data and details about the management of emergency procedures for each facility considered nevertheless the site specificity of the methodology is implicit in the development and estimation of hes moreover the methodology addresses human factor and hardware deterioration phenomena straightforwardly although they are relatively complex and challenging tasks the method provides thus a preliminary assessment of domino escalation probability and frequency 6 conclusion the present study was aimed at developing a systematic approach for the quantitative assessment of cascading events affecting offshore o g installations the influence of harsh environment on barrier performance was considered through the implementation of dedicated scoring systems for external meteorological climate and behavioural factors based on expert judgment a specific assessment of emergency response times and intervention allowed obtaining an accurate evaluation of firefighting procedures and intervention in offshore remote location and their effect on risk the modified performance parameters of safety barriers allow a more detailed frequency assessment of escalation scenarios the outcome of the methodology may drive the design of hardware safety barriers in order to limit the likelihood of cascading events triggered by fire the analysis also highlights the need for a timely effective emergency response in order to decrease the risk profile of offshore facilities harsh conditions considerably affect the emergency response time and this results in lower safety level with respect to asset protection
