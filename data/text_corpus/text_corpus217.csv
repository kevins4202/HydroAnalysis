content tp samples of sediment were mineralised spectrally with pure concentrated hno3 in a mars 6 240 50 microwave mineraliser cem matthews usa with the phosphorus in the obtained mineral being determined spectrophotometrically an aquamate thermo scientific spectrophotometer was used in spectrophotometric analyses the organic matter in entrapped sediment oms was calculated from relations resulting from losses on ignition at 550 c for 4h sediment hydration was determined by weighing the determined weight of wet sediment and then drying the sediment at room temperature until an airtight solid mass was obtained the sediment hydration was determined from the difference in masses recorded before and after drying zhu et al 2015 the content of carbonates caco3 in sediments was determined by scheibler s method bednarek et al 2004 as based on the decomposition reaction of carbonates in 10 hcl with the co2 emission then determined as suspended sediment was being studied monitoring of basic physical and chemical parameters of reservoir water was also ongoing water samples for analysis were taken from depth of 50 cm at the same place in which the sedimentation trap was set in the in situ conditions water temperature t w electrolytic conductivity ph dissolved oxygen concentration and water oxygen saturation o2 were measured with a hach lange hq30d multiparameter probe under laboratory conditions the suspended sediment ss and organic matter in suspended sediment omss were determined in samples of water collected determinations as regards suspended sediment were achieved following filtering of sample of water of known volume through a gf f glass fibre filter prior to filtration this filter was subject to ignition for 4h at 550 c then cooled in a desiccator and weighed after filtration the filter was dried at 105 c for 4h before being cooled and weighed in a desiccator the amount of suspended sediment ss was determined from the difference in masses before and after drying subsequently for organic matter in suspended sediment omss determinations the filter with filtration and drying residue was subjected to ignition at 550 c for 4h then cooled and weighed in a desiccator the omss content was calculated by reference to the relationship resulting from losses during ignition zhu et al 2015 at the same time as study was being conducted atmospheric conditions were also being observed for this purpose characteristic weather data were obtained from the brzozów ibrzozwg3 meteorological station about 1500m from the research site monitoring of weather conditions related to daily parameters i e air temperature precipitation wind speed and direction in addition the instantaneous flow of water in the reservoir was determined at certain intervals a laser portable pvm pd speed metre nivus germany was used for this purpose the water velocity in the reservoir was determined in a channel below the dam measurements were made in a cross section of the channel of precisely determined geometric parameters along with the height of water table in the channel and were used to calculate the discharge of the reservoir 3 results and discussion weather conditions observed during study are shown in table 2 and fig 2 with the data collected being based on the weather underground portal 2017 which shows the actual recorded weather conditions the average daily air temperature during the study varied between 18 0 c and 21 4 c the highest average wind speed of 8 56kmh 1 determined on the basis of average values was recorded in the first series of the study while during the remaining series the average wind speed remained at a comparable level and oscillated in the range 5 8 6 42kmh 1 with intensive precipitation increasing movements of air masses were observed the highest average precipitation determined on the basis of daily maximum values was observed in the first series of the study i e 4 13mm while the lowest was the 1 88mm noted for the second series hydrological conditions in the reservoir at the time of the study were as shown in table 3 instantaneous water flows ranged from 0 0044 to 0 0195m3 s 1 while average flow in the reservoir over the analysed period was 0 01m3 s 1 the highest flows were observed in periods of intense precipitation table 4 presents the results of analyses for selected physicochemical parameters of the reservoir waters over the analysed period the average water temperature was 22 5 c though with variation across the range of 18 0 27 1 c the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water studied ranged from 3 45 to 7 38mgdm 3 mean 5 88 with this corresponding to saturation in the 36 5 99 2 range mean 70 8 a statistically significant positive correlation between water temperature and oxygen saturation of water was observed r 2 0 759 p 0 05 the highest recorded oxygen saturation of water occurred during the period of high water temperature in the reservoir at a water temperature of 27 1 c oxygen saturation reached a maximum level of 99 2 this relationship points to an intensive process of photosynthesis on warm sunny days while no significant differences were observed between individual readings for ph a positive linear relationship was to be noted between ph values and oxygen saturation in water r 2 0 7982 p 0 05 this may point to an imbalance between production and respiration processes in the reservoir under study in the case of electrolytic conductivity like ph values no significant differences between individual measurements were observed the average value over the studied period was 461μscm 1 with the range of values being 425 484μscm 1 electrolytic conductivity depends on the number of ions present in water in natural waters ions usually originate from the presence of inorganic compounds mainly resulting from surface runoffs and the mineralisation of organic matter kajak 1998 the suspended sediment ss content in the water studied was in the range 3 8 10 4mgl 1 mean 7 13mgdm 3 while the content of organic matter omss ranged from 32 7 to 73 7 mean 54 4 a statistically significant negative correlation was to be observed between these parameters fig 3 r 2 0 9354 p 0 01 the highest contents of organic matter omss were recorded where the content of suspended sediment was low i e at times when water flows in the reservoir were at their lowest series ii with a sufficiently long retention time at least several days to several weeks phytoplankton and zooplankton may develop in the reservoir and partially undergo sedimentation kajak 1998 development of organisms in the water column was indeed found to influence the content of organic matter suspended in water omss significantly this being reflected in the values recorded for this parameter over the period under analysis the retention time of water in the reservoir was longest in relation to remaining research period the highest suspended sediment contents were observed at times of heavy precipitation fig 2 the latter was also accompanied by the highest water flows table 3 it can be concluded that at times of increased turbulent water flow in the reservoir material deposited at the bottom may be re suspended cieślewicz 2011 with particles of matter in particular fine grained fractions of soil clays loams etc thus rising back up the water column the higher content of the suspended sediment in the water can be also the result of intensive surface runoffs moreover it was possible to note a clear correlation between the average content of suspended sediment ss in water and the sedimentation rate us for suspended sediment in the water column in the first and third series the average suspended sediment contents were 9 2 and 8 2mgl 1 respectively while at that time the sedimentation rate achieves maximum values of 16 9 and 17 7gd 1 m 2 respectively in the second series the sedimentation rate decreased 13 5gd 1 m 2 along with the reduction in the content of suspended sediment to an average level of 4 0mgl 1 fig 4 analysis of selected parameters characterising entrapped sediment table 5 revealed no significant differences in chemical composition however it was possible to observe differences in the amounts of entrapped sediment sediment hydration noted in the course of individual research series remained at a similar level across the range 91 95 comparisons with literature data in relation to collected amounts of sediments do not allow for unequivocal determinations in the face of the similarity of results obtained for example studies on the sediment load in china s lake taihu have shown that the annual average sedimentation rate there is 377gd 1 m 2 according to the authors of the study this value is much higher than in many other lakes in the world zhu et al 2015 on the other hand studies on sediment particles carried out in the río grande ii lake colombia showed that over the analysed period the mean sedimentation rate was of 4540gd 1 m 2 while individual values oscillated between 229 and 18 573gd 1 m 2 moreno and ramire 2010 the analysis of year round observations of sedimentation material in lake viitna linajärv estonia in turn showed sedimentation rates of between 0 23 and 1 4gd 1 m 2 terasmaa and punning 2006 results for sedimentation rate presented in this study differ significantly from those obtained in other lakes around the world however it is necessary to take account of the fact that presented values derive from studies carried out under differing research conditions particle size fraction region climatic zone and weather conditions season and depth of the water column may all influence the intensity of the sedimentation process guidi et al 2008 the duration and timing of trap exposure trap design solutions immersion depth reservoir and catchment parameters can also help account for significant variability in results for sedimentation rate studies on sludge sedimentation in lake linajärv estonia terasmaa and punning 2006 also showed that particulate matter was aggregated during subsidence especially when it came to sedimentary planktonic material characterised by a high sorption capacity as a result the highest levels of sedimentation of suspended sediment in water were to be observed in spring and summer the aggregation phenomenon also depends inter alia on other physico chemical and electrochemical conditions of water properties of elementary particles om content and water flow rate madeyski et al 2008 also aquatic vegetation has a beneficial effect on the reduction of soil erosion and transport of sediments to the reservoir while depending on the sediment supplied and on flow velocity in the reservoir coarser sediments tend to be deposited in the area of inflow to the reservoir whereas fine sediments reach to the lower zone of the reservoir in the form of suspended load small sediments factions are adsorbed by the plant surface and their root system forms a natural barrier between components of water sediment system schleiss et al 2016 the formation of calcium carbonate in water can also determine the sedimentation process of particulates precipitation and sedimentation of calcium carbonate are inter alia regulated by changes in co2 concentration resulting from photosynthesis co2 is used along with intensive photosynthesis which results in displacement of the chemical balance between forms of carbonate present in the water precipitated inert calcium carbonate may self sediment and also affect the binding and co sedimentation of other substances such as organic matter different compounds containing phosphorus bacteria etc kajak 1998 wojtkowska et al 2016 zamorska 2018 the caco3 content in the entrapped sediment varied from 8 96 to 11 5 the average content being 10 2 as in the case of tn toc and oms an upward trend in caco3 content was observed in the subsequent study stages fig 5 the average content of organic matter oms in the entrapped sediment 16 0 table 5 should be set against the specific average content of organic matter in the suspended sediment omss i e 54 4 table 4 this may indicate a rapid decomposition for organic matter in the course of its subsidence the relationship between organic carbon toc and organic matter oms content in the suspended sediment thus emerges as interesting for the needs of the study the 1 74 conversion rate proposed for bottom sediments by murdoch and co authors 1997 was used to calculate the organic carbon content based on the organic matter content and is not applicable to sediments consisting of sediment particulates in water column on the basis of research carried out the average value for the conversion rate in question is 3 31 this value is almost twice as high as the conversion rate applied thus far in relation to bottom sediments however it should be noted that the determined calculator is an approximate figure obtained from preliminary research to confirm this value studies should be continued on a wider scale with other bodies of water included the most commonly used ratio detecting the origin of organic matter in bottom sediments is that between total organic carbon and total nitrogen toc tn organic matter is considered of allochthonous origin where the toc tn value is greater than 12 and of autochthonous origin where it is below 8 for phytoplankton the toc tn ratio is between 6 7 and 10 1 and for bacteria between 2 6 and 4 3 tarnawski et al 2012 piwińska and gruca rokosz 2016 koszelnik et al 2018 the calculated molar average toc tn ratio for sediments studied was 8 9 while the individual values for this index in subsequent series of studies were in the 8 3 9 4 range pointing to the autochthonous origin of sedimentary organic matter the lowest value for this indicator was recorded in a period of lowest flow and highest water retention time in the reservoir the toc tn ratio is also affected by oxidation of organic matter in the water column allowing the toc tn value in sediments to serve as an indicator of temporary changes in the cycle of organic matter in aquatic ecosystems koszelnik 2009 tarnawski et al 2012 piwińska and gruca rokosz 2016 the nature of organic matter is subject to constant change during transport into the reservoir and subsidence in the water column and after deposition to the bottom wojtkowska and domachowski 2009 however the pace and specificity of changes largely depend on chemical properties of the organic material and conditions in the body of water in shallow reservoirs the organic material is deposited more quickly in bottom sediments and thus exposed to oxidation processes in water for a shorter time however in such reservoirs bottom sediments often undergo re suspension with the result that particles of matter are re exposed in the water column cieślewicz 2011 the contribution of autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter as calculated on the basis of the two sources model reveals that the material under study was dominated by matter of autochthonous origin on average 81 6 of organic matter came from internal production in the reservoir with the highest share being 86 2 observed in series ii i e at the time of the longest period of retention of water in the reservoir and hence the conditions most favourable to the development of phytoplankton it was in the same period that the highest content of total phosphorus was recorded amounting to 1 71mgg 1 d w dry weight biological transformation of phosphorus depends to a large extent on biochemical transformations of carbon and nitrogen tarnawski et al 2012 however the trend for changes in the content of total phosphorus in the sediments studied differed from that of organic carbon and total nitrogen in the cases of nitrogen and carbon content the increase was observed along with time fig 5 and regardless of the hydrological conditions present in the reservoir the content of total phosphorus however clearly depended on the flow in the reservoir and on the share of organic matter of autochthonous origin in sediment during periods of intensive flow the phosphorus content was at a similar level assuming value in series i and iii equal to 1 08 and 1 22mgg 1 d w dry weight an important role in the phosphorus cycle in aquatic ecosystems is played by retention time which is the time over which phosphorus is retained in fauna and flora i e mainly zooplankton and phytoplankton as well as bacteria kajak 1998 it is precisely with the phenomenon of phosphorus retention in plant and animal cells that a periodic increase in its content in particles of sediment in water can be identified it was as phosphorus content increased that the lowest toc tn ratio and the highest contribution of organic matter of autochthonous origin was to observed with these being higher than in other research series these relationships indicate that in a period of longer retention in a reservoir and under appropriate environmental conditions intensive development of aquatic organisms that assimilate phosphorus compounds takes place the highest water temperature of 27 5 c recorded in this period suggests optimal conditions for the development of photosynthetic organisms high water temperature intensifies processes of photosynthesis with the potential result of periodic high oxygen saturation of surface water layers kajak 1998 wojtkowska and domachowski 2009 this thesis is confirmed by the coincident occurrence of the highest content of oxygen dissolved in water 99 2 as well as water ph of 9 23 it was also at this time when the highest content of organic matter in suspension omss equal to 73 7 was recorded table 4 along with an increase in phosphorus content a decrease in sedimentation rate was to be observed in the analysed period as compared with other research series this may be due to the nature of sediment particles at that time consisting of organic matter of autochthonous origin to the tune of 86 2 table 5 the composition of sedimentary autochthonous organic matter is inter alia dominated by micro organisms of small size and mass with the potential consequence that a smaller total mass of entrapped sediment the second series of studies also coincided with significantly lower precipitation which resulted in reduced surface runoff and hence also diminished transport of suspended matter and organic matter of terrigenous origin 4 conclusions multiple relationships emerge from the described research conducted on suspended sediment in a water column as well as entrapped sediment in the traps sedimentation rate and the nature of suspended sediment were observed to differ in relation to research period and environmental conditions analysis of results obtained pointed to a significant negative linear correlation between the content of suspended sediment in water ss and organic matter in suspended sediment omss basically the content of suspended sediment increased as that of organic matter decreased on the other hand differences in organic matter content in entrapped sediment in the trap oms and suspended sediment omss indicated that the reservoir under study was capable of sustaining a rapid rate of decomposition of organic matter in the water column the relationship between the percentage of organic carbon toc and organic matter in entrapped sediment oms was interesting in that a commonly used conversion factor for organic carbon to organic matter in bottom sediments does not apply where sediments consist of sediment particulates present in a water column analysis of the origin of organic matter showed that autochthonous matter dominated in the period under analysis the highest contribution of organic matter of autochthonous origin was observed in the period of longest water retention time in the reservoir it was also in this period that the highest content of total phosphorus was recorded in sediments collected the trend as regards changes in total phosphorus content in collected sediments was also found to differ from toc and tn content it was as the p content was increasing that the lowest toc tn ratio and highest contribution of organic matter of autochthonous origin were observed these parameters indicate that where water is retained for longer time in a reservoir and where conditions are appropriate otherwise intensive development of organisms that assimilate phosphorus compounds is able to take place moreover as phosphorus content increased over the period analysed a rate of particulate sedimentation lower than in the other research series is to be observed it has also proved possible to demonstrate a clear correlation between the content of suspended sediment ss in water and the sedimentation rate us for those solids sedimentation rate depended on the content of suspended sediment in water research likewise confirms that the nature and specificity of suspended particles affect the rate at which matter settles as well as potentially determines the processes via which the reservoir experiences siltation conflict of interest none declared ethical statement

laboratory conditions the suspended sediment ss and organic matter in suspended sediment omss were determined in samples of water collected determinations as regards suspended sediment were achieved following filtering of sample of water of known volume through a gf f glass fibre filter prior to filtration this filter was subject to ignition for 4h at 550 c then cooled in a desiccator and weighed after filtration the filter was dried at 105 c for 4h before being cooled and weighed in a desiccator the amount of suspended sediment ss was determined from the difference in masses before and after drying subsequently for organic matter in suspended sediment omss determinations the filter with filtration and drying residue was subjected to ignition at 550 c for 4h then cooled and weighed in a desiccator the omss content was calculated by reference to the relationship resulting from losses during ignition zhu et al 2015 at the same time as study was being conducted atmospheric conditions were also being observed for this purpose characteristic weather data were obtained from the brzozów ibrzozwg3 meteorological station about 1500m from the research site monitoring of weather conditions related to daily parameters i e air temperature precipitation wind speed and direction in addition the instantaneous flow of water in the reservoir was determined at certain intervals a laser portable pvm pd speed metre nivus germany was used for this purpose the water velocity in the reservoir was determined in a channel below the dam measurements were made in a cross section of the channel of precisely determined geometric parameters along with the height of water table in the channel and were used to calculate the discharge of the reservoir 3 results and discussion weather conditions observed during study are shown in table 2 and fig 2 with the data collected being based on the weather underground portal 2017 which shows the actual recorded weather conditions the average daily air temperature during the study varied between 18 0 c and 21 4 c the highest average wind speed of 8 56kmh 1 determined on the basis of average values was recorded in the first series of the study while during the remaining series the average wind speed remained at a comparable level and oscillated in the range 5 8 6 42kmh 1 with intensive precipitation increasing movements of air masses were observed the highest average precipitation determined on the basis of daily maximum values was observed in the first series of the study i e 4 13mm while the lowest was the 1 88mm noted for the second series hydrological conditions in the reservoir at the time of the study were as shown in table 3 instantaneous water flows ranged from 0 0044 to 0 0195m3 s 1 while average flow in the reservoir over the analysed period was 0 01m3 s 1 the highest flows were observed in periods of intense precipitation table 4 presents the results of analyses for selected physicochemical parameters of the reservoir waters over the analysed period the average water temperature was 22 5 c though with variation across the range of 18 0 27 1 c the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water studied ranged from 3 45 to 7 38mgdm 3 mean 5 88 with this corresponding to saturation in the 36 5 99 2 range mean 70 8 a statistically significant positive correlation between water temperature and oxygen saturation of water was observed r 2 0 759 p 0 05 the highest recorded oxygen saturation of water occurred during the period of high water temperature in the reservoir at a water temperature of 27 1 c oxygen saturation reached a maximum level of 99 2 this relationship points to an intensive process of photosynthesis on warm sunny days while no significant differences were observed between individual readings for ph a positive linear relationship was to be noted between ph values and oxygen saturation in water r 2 0 7982 p 0 05 this may point to an imbalance between production and respiration processes in the reservoir under study in the case of electrolytic conductivity like ph values no significant differences between individual measurements were observed the average value over the studied period was 461μscm 1 with the range of values being 425 484μscm 1 electrolytic conductivity depends on the number of ions present in water in natural waters ions usually originate from the presence of inorganic compounds mainly resulting from surface runoffs and the mineralisation of organic matter kajak 1998 the suspended sediment ss content in the water studied was in the range 3 8 10 4mgl 1 mean 7 13mgdm 3 while the content of organic matter omss ranged from 32 7 to 73 7 mean 54 4 a statistically significant negative correlation was to be observed between these parameters fig 3 r 2 0 9354 p 0 01 the highest contents of organic matter omss were recorded where the content of suspended sediment was low i e at times when water flows in the reservoir were at their lowest series ii with a sufficiently long retention time at least several days to several weeks phytoplankton and zooplankton may develop in the reservoir and partially undergo sedimentation kajak 1998 development of organisms in the water column was indeed found to influence the content of organic matter suspended in water omss significantly this being reflected in the values recorded for this parameter over the period under analysis the retention time of water in the reservoir was longest in relation to remaining research period the highest suspended sediment contents were observed at times of heavy precipitation fig 2 the latter was also accompanied by the highest water flows table 3 it can be concluded that at times of increased turbulent water flow in the reservoir material deposited at the bottom may be re suspended cieślewicz 2011 with particles of matter in particular fine grained fractions of soil clays loams etc thus rising back up the water column the higher content of the suspended sediment in the water can be also the result of intensive surface runoffs moreover it was possible to note a clear correlation between the average content of suspended sediment ss in water and the sedimentation rate us for suspended sediment in the water column in the first and third series the average suspended sediment contents were 9 2 and 8 2mgl 1 respectively while at that time the sedimentation rate achieves maximum values of 16 9 and 17 7gd 1 m 2 respectively in the second series the sedimentation rate decreased 13 5gd 1 m 2 along with the reduction in the content of suspended sediment to an average level of 4 0mgl 1 fig 4 analysis of selected parameters characterising entrapped sediment table 5 revealed no significant differences in chemical composition however it was possible to observe differences in the amounts of entrapped sediment sediment hydration noted in the course of individual research series remained at a similar level across the range 91 95 comparisons with literature data in relation to collected amounts of sediments do not allow for unequivocal determinations in the face of the similarity of results obtained for example studies on the sediment load in china s lake taihu have shown that the annual average sedimentation rate there is 377gd 1 m 2 according to the authors of the study this value is much higher than in many other lakes in the world zhu et al 2015 on the other hand studies on sediment particles carried out in the río grande ii lake colombia showed that over the analysed period the mean sedimentation rate was of 4540gd 1 m 2 while individual values oscillated between 229 and 18 573gd 1 m 2 moreno and ramire 2010 the analysis of year round observations of sedimentation material in lake viitna linajärv estonia in turn showed sedimentation rates of between 0 23 and 1 4gd 1 m 2 terasmaa and punning 2006 results for sedimentation rate presented in this study differ significantly from those obtained in other lakes around the world however it is necessary to take account of the fact that presented values derive from studies carried out under differing research conditions particle size fraction region climatic zone and weather conditions season and depth of the water column may all influence the intensity of the sedimentation process guidi et al 2008 the duration and timing of trap exposure trap design solutions immersion depth reservoir and catchment parameters can also help account for significant variability in results for sedimentation rate studies on sludge sedimentation in lake linajärv estonia terasmaa and punning 2006 also showed that particulate matter was aggregated during subsidence especially when it came to sedimentary planktonic material characterised by a high sorption capacity as a result the highest levels of sedimentation of suspended sediment in water were to be observed in spring and summer the aggregation phenomenon also depends inter alia on other physico chemical and electrochemical conditions of water properties of elementary particles om content and water flow rate madeyski et al 2008 also aquatic vegetation has a beneficial effect on the reduction of soil erosion and transport of sediments to the reservoir while depending on the sediment supplied and on flow velocity in the reservoir coarser sediments tend to be deposited in the area of inflow to the reservoir whereas fine sediments reach to the lower zone of the reservoir in the form of suspended load small sediments factions are adsorbed by the plant surface and their root system forms a natural barrier between components of water sediment system schleiss et al 2016 the formation of calcium carbonate in water can also determine the sedimentation process of particulates precipitation and sedimentation of calcium carbonate are inter alia regulated by changes in co2 concentration resulting from photosynthesis co2 is used along with intensive photosynthesis which results in displacement of the chemical balance between forms of carbonate present in the water precipitated inert calcium carbonate may self sediment and also affect the binding and co sedimentation of other substances such as organic matter different compounds containing phosphorus bacteria etc kajak 1998 wojtkowska et al 2016 zamorska 2018 the caco3 content in the entrapped sediment varied from 8 96 to 11 5 the average content being 10 2 as in the case of tn toc and oms an upward trend in caco3 content was observed in the subsequent study stages fig 5 the average content of organic matter oms in the entrapped sediment 16 0 table 5 should be set against the specific average content of organic matter in the suspended sediment omss i e 54 4 table 4 this may indicate a rapid decomposition for organic matter in the course of its subsidence the relationship between organic carbon toc and organic matter oms content in the suspended sediment thus emerges as interesting for the needs of the study the 1 74 conversion rate proposed for bottom sediments by murdoch and co authors 1997 was used to calculate the organic carbon content based on the organic matter content and is not applicable to sediments consisting of sediment particulates in water column on the basis of research carried out the average value for the conversion rate in question is 3 31 this value is almost twice as high as the conversion rate applied thus far in relation to bottom sediments however it should be noted that the determined calculator is an approximate figure obtained from preliminary research to confirm this value studies should be continued on a wider scale with other bodies of water included the most commonly used ratio detecting the origin of organic matter in bottom sediments is that between total organic carbon and total nitrogen toc tn organic matter is considered of allochthonous origin where the toc tn value is greater than 12 and of autochthonous origin where it is below 8 for phytoplankton the toc tn ratio is between 6 7 and 10 1 and for bacteria between 2 6 and 4 3 tarnawski et al 2012 piwińska and gruca rokosz 2016 koszelnik et al 2018 the calculated molar average toc tn ratio for sediments studied was 8 9 while the individual values for this index in subsequent series of studies were in the 8 3 9 4 range pointing to the autochthonous origin of sedimentary organic matter the lowest value for this indicator was recorded in a period of lowest flow and highest water retention time in the reservoir the toc tn ratio is also affected by oxidation of organic matter in the water column allowing the toc tn value in sediments to serve as an indicator of temporary changes in the cycle of organic matter in aquatic ecosystems koszelnik 2009 tarnawski et al 2012 piwińska and gruca rokosz 2016 the nature of organic matter is subject to constant change during transport into the reservoir and subsidence in the water column and after deposition to the bottom wojtkowska and domachowski 2009 however the pace and specificity of changes largely depend on chemical properties of the organic material and conditions in the body of water in shallow reservoirs the organic material is deposited more quickly in bottom sediments and thus exposed to oxidation processes in water for a shorter time however in such reservoirs bottom sediments often undergo re suspension with the result that particles of matter are re exposed in the water column cieślewicz 2011 the contribution of autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter as calculated on the basis of the two sources model reveals that the material under study was dominated by matter of autochthonous origin on average 81 6 of organic matter came from internal production in the reservoir with the highest share being 86 2 observed in series ii i e at the time of the longest period of retention of water in the reservoir and hence the conditions most favourable to the development of phytoplankton it was in the same period that the highest content of total phosphorus was recorded amounting to 1 71mgg 1 d w dry weight biological transformation of phosphorus depends to a large extent on biochemical transformations of carbon and nitrogen tarnawski et al 2012 however the trend for changes in the content of total phosphorus in the sediments studied differed from that of organic carbon and total nitrogen in the cases of nitrogen and carbon content the increase was observed along with time fig 5 and regardless of the hydrological conditions present in the reservoir the content of total phosphorus however clearly depended on the flow in the reservoir and on the share of organic matter of autochthonous origin in sediment during periods of intensive flow the phosphorus content was at a similar level assuming value in series i and iii equal to 1 08 and 1 22mgg 1 d w dry weight an important role in the phosphorus cycle in aquatic ecosystems is played by retention time which is the time over which phosphorus is retained in fauna and flora i e mainly zooplankton and phytoplankton as well as bacteria kajak 1998 it is precisely with the phenomenon of phosphorus retention in plant and animal cells that a periodic increase in its content in particles of sediment in water can be identified it was as phosphorus content increased that the lowest toc tn ratio and the highest contribution of organic matter of autochthonous origin was to observed with these being higher than in other research series these relationships indicate that in a period of longer retention in a reservoir and under appropriate environmental conditions intensive development of aquatic organisms that assimilate phosphorus compounds takes place the highest water temperature of 27 5 c recorded in this period suggests optimal conditions for the development of photosynthetic organisms high water temperature intensifies processes of photosynthesis with the potential result of periodic high oxygen saturation of surface water layers kajak 1998 wojtkowska and domachowski 2009 this thesis is confirmed by the coincident occurrence of the highest content of oxygen dissolved in water 99 2 as well as water ph of 9 23 it was also at this time when the highest content of organic matter in suspension omss equal to 73 7 was recorded table 4 along with an increase in phosphorus content a decrease in sedimentation rate was to be observed in the analysed period as compared with other research series this may be due to the nature of sediment particles at that time consisting of organic matter of autochthonous origin to the tune of 86 2 table 5 the composition of sedimentary autochthonous organic matter is inter alia dominated by micro organisms of small size and mass with the potential consequence that a smaller total mass of entrapped sediment the second series of studies also coincided with significantly lower precipitation which resulted in reduced surface runoff and hence also diminished transport of suspended matter and organic matter of terrigenous origin 4 conclusions multiple relationships emerge from the described research conducted on suspended sediment in a water column as well as entrapped sediment in the traps sedimentation rate and the nature of suspended sediment were observed to differ in relation to research period and environmental conditions analysis of results obtained pointed to a significant negative linear correlation between the content of suspended sediment in water ss and organic matter in suspended sediment omss basically the content of suspended sediment increased as that of organic matter decreased on the other hand differences in organic matter content in entrapped sediment in the trap oms and suspended sediment omss indicated that the reservoir under study was capable of sustaining a rapid rate of decomposition of organic matter in the water column the relationship between the percentage of organic carbon toc and organic matter in entrapped sediment oms was interesting in that a commonly used conversion factor for organic carbon to organic matter in bottom sediments does not apply where sediments consist of sediment particulates present in a water column analysis of the origin of organic matter showed that autochthonous matter dominated in the period under analysis the highest contribution of organic matter of autochthonous origin was observed in the period of longest water retention time in the reservoir it was also in this period that the highest content of total phosphorus was recorded in sediments collected the trend as regards changes in total phosphorus content in collected sediments was also found to differ from toc and tn content it was as the p content was increasing that the lowest toc tn ratio and highest contribution of organic matter of autochthonous origin were observed these parameters indicate that where water is retained for longer time in a reservoir and where conditions are appropriate otherwise intensive development of organisms that assimilate phosphorus compounds is able to take place moreover as phosphorus content increased over the period analysed a rate of particulate sedimentation lower than in the other research series is to be observed it has also proved possible to demonstrate a clear correlation between the content of suspended sediment ss in water and the sedimentation rate us for those solids sedimentation rate depended on the content of suspended sediment in water research likewise confirms that the nature and specificity of suspended particles affect the rate at which matter settles as well as potentially determines the processes via which the reservoir experiences siltation conflict of interest none declared ethical statement

1086,the cyanobacteria constitute a diverse group of prokaryotic organisms widespread in aquatic ecosystems microcystis is a genus of freshwater cyanobacteria which poses a possible cause for concern due to its excessive growth and potential for toxin production which can be aggravated by intensive eutrophication of freshwaters and climate changes factors that can potentially affect the biology ecology and evolution of cyanobacteria are cyanophages this paper summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding cyanophages specific to microcystis sp in the natural environment of east asia and central europe being a group of planktonic viruses cyanophages have been studied since the 1960s information on viruses specific to microcystis sp was first obtained in the 1970s and are being dynamically developing over the last two decades there are eight strains of cyanophages capable of lysing microcystis sp cells reported to date belonging to myoviridae podoviridae and siphoviridae families as well as forming corticovirus like particles available literature data indicates that the gene encoding the sheath protein of the contractile tail g91 is a good molecular marker for tracing microcystis viruses from myoviridae as a form of environmental analysis it has been suggested that in natural ecosystems this group of cyanophages can cause a shift in the host population from predominant cyanophage infection sensitive to cyanophage infection insensitive cells rather than influencing the total number of microcystis sp it was found that nucleotide sequence of the g91 gene fragment isolated from central europe was 95 similar to that of its counterparts from east asia however the research based on molecular primers specific to the microcystis sp viruses is limitted to two of the known strains to date it is suggested that further studies in molecular biology and ecology of microcystis sp cyanophages should be based on metagenomics accompanied with physicochemical environmental variables keywords freshwater viruses blue green algae genetic markers co occurrence dynamics 1 introduction the cyanobacteria blue green algae is a group of heterogeneous bacteria which colonize even the most unfavourable aquatic environments from thermal reservoirs swamps and glacial meltwater streams to ice capped lakes the group has most likely been in existence for over 3 5 billion years during which time its members have gained various adaptations including the ability to conduct oxygenic photosynthesis and the potential for nitrogen fixation or toxin production whitton and potts 2002 komárek 2006 berman frank et al 2003 one of their representatives is the genus microcystis a gas vacuolate and planktonic cyanobacterium which is commonly found around the world in freshwater environments with increased numbers of trophic levels chorus and bartram 1999 harke et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 the possibility of a rapid growth of its biomass and the potential of some species strains to produce hepatotoxins such as microcystin raises concerns from users of the water bodies in which it occurs scientific reports have shown that some microcystis populations are permanently loaded with viral infections yoshida et al 2010 xia et al 2013 mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 aquatic viruses comprise the largest group of pathogens affecting microbial and higher organisms in freshwater and marine environments as well as their influence on the biological and ecological processes evolution and mortality of their hosts they also influence biogeochemical and nutrient cycling one particularly significant group of aquatic viruses is the cyanophages a group of viruses acting as infective agents of cyanobacteria hargreaves et al 2013 the first information regarding such viruses was obtained during the 1960s safferman and morris 1963 however more precise data of cyanophages infecting cyanobacteria of the genus microcystis was obtained in the seventies safferman et al 1969 fox et al 1976 since then there have been many reports about research on microcystis cyanophages but there are no documents summarizing the information about them thus the purpose of this review is to present current state of knowledge about isolated microcystis cyanophages and molecular studies demonstrating their mutual occurrence with host in freshwater environments 2 current knowledge about cyanophage strains specific to microcystis sp the first described virus specific for microcystis sp was sm 1 it was classified as a phycovirus based on its polyhedral capsid and lack of visible tail it was also found to be a double stranded dna virus with a diameter of around 88nm safferman et al 1969 the next microcystis virus to be identified was labelled sm 2 and its morphology placed it in the siphoviridae family it was found to bear a polyhedral head with a diameter of around 50 55nm measured from edge to edge and a non contractile and flexible tail measuring 130 140nm in length fox et al 1976 however later findings indicated that strains sm 1 and sm 2 were cyanophages specific to synechococcus sp suttle 2002 yoshida et al 2006 following this parker et al 1977 reported that chaplinskaya and goryushin 1966 data not available isolated the ma 1 cyanophage specific for microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa microcystis pulverea and microcystis musciola outdated name fifteen years later tucker and pollard 2005 isolated cyanophage ma lbp from an australian tank which was found to infect m aeruginosa this virus had a t7 like morphology with a short stubby tail and a capsid diameter of 42nm for ma lbpa or 52nm for ma lbpb placing ma lbp in the family podoviridae table 1 additionally the burst size was estimated at 28 cyanophages per host cell and the latent period was calculated as 11 2h one year later yoshida et al 2006 reported the isolation of the ma lmm01 cyanophage from a japanese freshwater reservoir numerous studies have since led to a greater understanding of its morphological structure and genetic characteristics and have clarified its ecological impact on its host the cyanobacteria of the genus microcystis yoshida et al 2008 yoshida et al 2010 kimura et al 2012 kimura et al 2013 kimura sakai 2014 this cyanophage was classified as a member of myoviridae by its icosahedral head and contractile tail the diameter of the head was estimated as 86nm and the maximum length of the tail as 209nm table 1 in addition the cyanophage burst size and latent period were indicated at 50 120 infectious units per cell and 6 12h respectively yoshida et al 2006 its genome was found to be 162109bp in length and displayed no homologous genes to known cyanophages however some of its genes were found to be highly similar to cyanobacterial genes e g genes of the ribonucleotide reductase and nonbleaching protein a gene this similarity suggested that horizontal gene transfer may take place between cyanophages specific to microcystis cyanobacteria and their hosts yoshida et al 2008 the next well established microcystis phage was mamv dc which was isolated from a chinese water body between 2013 and 2015 it was found to have an isometrically symmetrical capsid with a diameter of 70nm and a tail with a length of 160nm these features placed the cyanophage within the myoviridae family table 1 the virus burst size was found to be about 80 infectious units per cell its latent period between 24 and 48h and the length of its genome 169223bp sequence analysis of the phage genome confirmed that horizontal gene transfer had taken place between it and its cyanobacterial host ou et al 2013 2015 it should be mentioned that virus like particles able to infect microcystis sp have also been successfully isolated from the lake sediment in the united kingdom hargreaves et al 2013 and these were classified into the podoviridae and spihoviridae families the particles representing the podoviridae were round capsids with a diameter of 52nm without any apparent tail structure while those representing the spihoviridae family had a capsid with a diameter of 84nm and a tail 158nm in length table 1 in addition corticovirus like cyanophage particles have also been isolated from a chinese reservoir li et al 2013 they were found to have a round capsid with isohedral symmetry and a diameter ranging from 47nm to 53nm table 1 in addition a further microcystis cyanophage named φmhi42 has been isolated from an aqueous environment in the united kingdom φmhi42 has been classified as a member of the podoviridae family it comprises a capsid with a diameter ranging from 100nm to 120nm and a non contractile short tail table 1 watkins et al 2014 3 molecular studies on microcystis cyanophages demonstrating their dynamics in the natural environment studies of most microcystis cyanophages have provided information regarding their isolation their morphological features and their taxonomic affiliation determinations of their numbers and burst size and descriptions of their host interactions under controlled laboratory conditions among other things however the genome has been characterized in only two strains ma lmm01 and mamv dc the first molecular marker i e specific gene intended for the detection and quantification of cyanophages was designed for the strain ma lmm01 it was designed by takashima et al 2007 based on the ma lmm01 genome three genes encoding the proteins of the sheath protein g91 as well as the alpha and beta subunits of ribonucleotide reductase were chosen for sequencing together with their immediate up and down stream regions following this the sequences of these genes from the ma lmm01 phage were compared with their counterparts in three other myoviridae clonal isolates of ma lmm02 and ma lmm03 acquired from lake mikata japan and of ma hpm05 from hirosawanoike pond japan although the hosts of ma lmm02 ma lmm03 and ma hpm05 were not specified all three isolates appeared to be closely related to the ma lmm01 cyanophage based on their sequence similarities a characteristic genome sequence known as ma lmm01 type was designed with the sequence known the conserved sequences of the cyanophage type g91 gene fragment i e the gene encoding the sheath protein were chosen as a molecular marker the primer sheathrtf sheathrtr sheathrt table 2 and real time pcr specifications were proposed takashima et al 2007 these findings have since allowed the detection and quantitative analysis of dna and rna material of cyanophages associated with microcystis cyanobacteria in natural aquatic environments 3 1 dynamic changes in gene copy number in east asia the first analyses of cyanophages specific to microcystis cyanobacteria in the natural environment were conducted in east asia yoshida et al 2008 made the first description of the population dynamics of microcysis phages and of their hosts by examining the conserved fragments of the g91 gene for the former and those of the phycocyanin intergenic spacer pc igs gene for the latter in addition they also described the dynamics of potentially toxigenic populations of hosts by examining the occurrence of the mcya gene the examinations were conducted from april to december in 2006 in lake mikata japan the detected numbers of g91 gene fragments ranged from 1 1 102 to 1 1 104 copiesml 1 with an exception found during the beginning of april when the copy number was below the detection limit in the case of the pc igs gene fragment the amount was between 2 7 101 and 2 0 105 copiesml 1 and was not detected on december while the numbers of mcya gene copies ml 1 ranged from 5 2 101 to 2 1 103 in addition correlation analysis suggested that the microcystis phage was an important factor in determining the population dynamics of its host and might be the cause of a shift in composition towards non microcystin producing populations the killing the winner hypothesis indicates that cyanophage infections of cyanobacteria can result in the replacement of cyanophage sensitive populations with cyanophage insensitive populations a subsequent report by yoshida et al 2010 examined the dynamics of the g91 gene fragment and the cyanobacterial gene fragments pc igs and mcya over a longer period of time the analysis was conducted between may and november in the years 2006 2007 and 2008 in hirosawanoike pond japan during this period the gene copy numbers of phages ranged between 1 5 100 ml 1 and 1 7 103 ml 1 with the cyanobacterial gene copy numbers of pc igs and mcya ranging from 1 3 103 ml 1 to 5 8 108 ml 1 and 2 5 102 ml 1 to 2 1 107 ml 1 respectively no clear relationship was found between the phage g91 gene and pc igs microcystis gene in addition the number of infected host cells was estimated to be lower than the total number of microcystis cells ranging from 0 01 to 2 9cellsml 1 the calculation was made using the equation i c b where c was the cyanophages number per ml at sampling time and b was the burst size of ma lmm01 which suggested that only a small percentage of the microcystis sp population might be infected however the authors suggest that in this case the cyanophages may have been a factor which temporary influenced the shift in composition of different microcystis sp populations xia et al 2013 examined the population dynamic of microcystis cyanophages represented by the g91 gene fragment and microcystis sp represented by the pc igs gene fragment from may 2012 to april 2013 in east lake china the findings indicated that the g91 gene copy number ranged between 7 16 10 1 ml 1 and 2 53 105 ml 1 and the pc igs copy number from 5 43 103 to 8 39 105 ml 1 despite the similar population dynamics and significant abundance correlation between phage and cyanobacteria genes the authors emphasize that three different types of m aeruginosa were detected during the study of which only some were susceptible to the ma lmm01 type phage in a study in hirosawanoike pond japan kimura et al 2012 examined whether infection with ma lmm01 like type cyanophages is closely related to the day night cycle the study used quantitative real time pcr to determine the abundance of the pc igs gene corresponding to m aeruginosa number and the number of g91 gene copies per ml of water corresponding to the number of free phage particles in the water based on dna material g91 dna and phages associated with the host cell based on dna g91 dna and rna material g91 rna samples were taken every 3h starting from 9 over 24 h sampling periods sampling was performed twice in autumn 2009 in addition the occurrence of the pc igs gene represented m aeruginosa and of the g91 gene representing the cyanophage was determined based on sampling performed once per month during the spring to autumn period 2009 the results of the two diel analysis indicate that approximately 106 copies of the pc igs gene representing the cyanobacteria were present per ml with a peak occurring at 03 00 for both sampling periods in contrast the concentration of g91 representing the free virus fraction ranged from 102 to 103 ml 1 during the first sampling period with a peak visible between 15 00 and 18 00 with other peaks visible at 00 00 and between 03 00 and 06 00 during the second sampling period the g91 gene copy fragment number representing the number of cyanophages in the host cell reached a maximum between 104 and 106 ml 1 with peaks visible at 15 00 and 21 00 during the first sampling period and peaks between 12 00 and 15 00 and at 03 00 during the second sampling period additionally g91 replication peaked at 12 00 relative abundance 0 0051 and reached the lowest value at 03 00 relative abundance 0 0007 during the first sampling period with a similar pattern of replication observed for the second sampling day kimura et al 2012 suggest that the peaks of the cyanophage g91 dna observed in both fractions during the afternoon may be the result of active cyanophage production and attribute the night time peaks to the accumulation of microcystis sp biomass as virions may remain trapped by the remains of the host cell or its colonies and only small amounts can diffuse into the water the viral infection of cyanobacteria may occur according to a diel cycle this cycle may be influenced by the presence of light which influences the intracellular transformations of cyanobacteria associated with photosynthesis further analysis identified between 6 1 104 and 3 9 107 copies of the pc igs gene fragment of the analyzed cyanobacteria per ml of water during the spring autumn period in addition during the study the concentration of g91 gene fragments representing the number free particles of cyanophages per ml of water ranged from undetectable to 8 2 102 whereas the numbers of viruses present in the host cell ranged from 2 5 101 to 1 6 106 kimura et al 2012 note considerably fewer g91 gene copies in the free phage fraction than in the host cell fraction additionally similar trends were observed for cyanophage and cyanobacteria numbers suggesting that part of the cyanobacteria population is continually infected by cyanophages tail pcr thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr using g91 f g91 r primers table 2 and sequencing of sample dna was performed to allow clonal analysis of the g91 gene fragments in the fractions of free cyanophages cyanophages present in host cells and rna fractions kimura et al 2012 based on these findings 87 sequences of the g91 gene were classified into 71 genotypes maximum parsimony network analysis was then performed to divide the obtained genotypes into three sequence groups group i consisting of 62 genotypes group ii consisting of seven genotypes and group iii consisting of two genotypes it was also found that the previously isolated ma lmm01 cyanophage was genetically distinct from these groups kimura et al 2012 however kimura sakai et al 2014 later classified ma lmm01 to group iii it was thus indicated that the above mentioned sheathrt primers could be used as tools for the detection of ma lmm01 like cyanophages also from group iii and that the true amount of ma lmm01 like cyanophages specific for microcystis may be underestimated therefore a new primer set called g91 drtpf1 g91 drtpr2 was designed by kimura sakai et al 2014 these primers were based on 434 sequences representing 43 genotypes present in more than two clones of ma lmm01 like type cyanophages obtained by kimura et al 2013 and could be used for amplification of 206bp g91 gene fragments table 2 targeting genotype groups i iii the samples were also subjected to quantitative real time pcr qpcr analysis using old and new primers kimura sakai et al 2014 changes in cyanophage level were estimated based on the number of g91 genes per ml of sample taken from hirosawanoike pond japan between april and november 2010 the material was tested in two variants as cyanophage particles present in water and cyanophages present in host cells sheathrt primer analyses found the concentrations of g91 gene fragments representing the numbers of cyanophages present in the water remained below the detection limit throughout the study period in turn the concentration of g91 gene fragments representing cyanophages present in the host cell remained low from april to august with a clear increase to 6 8 105 in early october the analyses with the new primers found the numbers of g91 gene fragments representing the numbers of free cyanophages to remain within the range 2 8 103 to 2 0 104 ml 1 throughout the analysis period the copy numbers of g91 gene fragments representing cyanophages presented in host cells remained between 3 2 102 and 4 0 103 ml 1 from april to july increasing from august to november with a maximum of 7 0 105 in early october in addition the sequences of the amplified g91 gene fragment obtained with the use of newly designed primers were mostly conservative kimura sakai et al 2014 conclude that the newly designed primers for the amplification of g91 gene fragment of ma lmm01 like type cyanophages allow greater detection of related viruses from groups i iii the best examples were the above mentioned analyses of the free virus fraction in water more importantly no gene copies were detectable with the use of the sheathrt primers with the new primers the numbers of copies of g91 gene fragments were found in the range of 103 104 ml 1 the authors also note that qpcr analyses of the g91 ml 1 gene based on new primers may underestimate the true number of analyzed cyanophages due to the existence of yet undiscovered viruses related to ma lmm01 cyanophages in the natural environment 3 2 dynamic changes in the genes copy number in area of central europe similar research has also been conducted in central europe one such study performed in the sulejów reservoir in poland examined the population dynamics of microcystis cyanobacteria and their toxigenic strains by assaying 16s rrna and mcya gene fragment copy numbers as well as microcystis specific cyanophage numbers represented by the g91 gene fragment during five consecutive spring and autumn seasons in the years 2009 2013 mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 sheathrt primers were used to amplify the g91 gene the results relative values indicated that the 16s rrna copy numbers fell from 6 85 106 ml 1 in 2009 to 2 22 107 ml 1 in 2011 while mcya copy number fell from 3 82 104 ml 1 in 2012 to 1 15 107 in 2011ml 1 mean g91 gene fragment copy number fell from 2 62 104 ml 1 in 2009 to 1 44 106 ml 1 in 2010 mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 indicated that generally the cyanophages appeared simultaneously or after the appearance of the genus microcystis including toxic genotypes and accompanied them until the end of each season the highest number of cyanophages was found in 2010 when a water bloom developed as a result of stabilization of hydrological conditions an increase in temperature and the presence of optimal nutrient concentrations for the development of blue green algae further studies performed in this polish waterbody sequenced the viral sheath protein encoding the g91 gene based on sanger technology the obtained data showed 95 homology 100 query coverage with cyanophage strains ma lmm01 ma lmm02 ma lmm03 and ma hpm05 classified as myoviridae isolated from freshwater in japan in addition the blast analysis also identified homologies with an mamv dc strain of myoviridae isolated from a chinese reservoir mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 yoshida et al 2008 ou et al 2013 these analyses of the dynamics of the co occurrence of microcystis represented by 16s rrna and mcya gene fragments and cyanophages represented by the g91 gene fragment were continued in the spring autumn seasons of 2014 and 2015 in the sulejów and jeziorsko reservoirs fig 1 in accordance with the methodology described by mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 in the sulejów reservoir the copy number of the 16s rrna gene fragment was both higher 2 57 108 ml 1 and lower 2 39 104 ml 1 in 2014 than 2015 in turn the mcya gene fragment was more abundant 3 18 107 ml 1 in the 2014 season but least below the detection limit i e 2 00 104 ml 1 in 2015 the g91 gene fragment had its highest 2 93 106 ml 1 and lowest below the detection limit i e 2 00 104 ml 1 copy numbers in 2014 the mean copy numbers of 16s rrna mcya and g91 gene fragments were 107 105 to 106 105 respectively table 3 in the case of jeziorsko reservoir 16s rrna gene copy number peaked at 4 27 109 in 2015 and reached its lowest value below the detection limit i e 2 00 104 ml 1 2014 mcya gene fragment copy number was also the highest in 2015 8 06 108 ml 1 and the lowest below detection limit in 2014 g91 gene copy number reached 3 58 107 in 2014 with a minimum value below the detection level the mean values for the number of copies of the 16s rrna mcya g91 gene fragments were 108 107to 108 and 106 to 107 respectively table 3 typically 10 100 times more copies of the gene fragments were obtained from the jeziorsko reservoir than the sulejów reservoir this difference has been attributed to differences in the place and method of taking samples samples from the sulejów reservoir were taken from the water column in the area of the open part of the reservoir while samples from the jeziorsko reservoir were taken from the surface of the water 0 0 5m from a small bay where the water bloom accumulated in addition the dynamics analyses indicated that cyanophage levels accompanied those of cyanobacteria in the water of both reservoirs usually from the beginning of the spring season to the end of the autumn season in 2014 and 2015 fig 2 although the cyanophages and cyanobacteria including their toxigenic strains of the sulejów reservoir shared similar population dynamics in 2014 their numbers diverged between 02 july and 21 august 2015 as well as between 18 september and 16 november 2015 this could be explained by the killing the winner hypothesis fig 2 in this case the antagonistic relationship should be understood as an increasing peak in the number of cyanophages with a simultaneous decrease in the amount of cyanobacteria this is followed by a decrease in the number of cyanophages which may be accompanied by an increase in the number of cyanobacteria no clear correlation was found between the dynamics of occurrence of cyanophages and toxigenic microsystis cyanobacteria in either reservoir in the period 2014 2015 fig 2 however in the jeziorsko reservoir antagonistic relationships occurred between 07 july and 04 august and again from 24 august to 14 october during the 2014 season in the 2015 season cyanophage numbers reflected cyanobacterial numbers without any apparent antagonistic relationships fig 2 these findings from the two reservoirs during the spring and autumn seasons 2014 and 2015 also support yoshida et al 2010 and mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 who propose that viruses specific for blue green algae may co exist with their host rather than influence their total number however the antagonistic events might result from a shift in cyanobacterial population type according to the killing the winner hypothesis yoshida et al 2008 kimura et al 2013 kimura sakai et al 2014 4 future direction of microcystis cyanophages research presented molecular base studies on dynamics of cyanophages specific for microcystis were indirectly possible by successfully characterized genome of ma lmm01 cyanophage strain from myoviridae family which was isolated from the natural environment takashima et al 2007 yoshida et al 2008 therefore the freshwater dynamic analyses are limited only to the one type of microcystis phage from one particular family without the possibility of estimation the entire community of mentioned viruses kimura et al 2012 kimura sakai et al 2014 isolation of cyanophages from the environment together with its genome characterization is difficult and time consuming especially that cyanophages can be host specific targeting cyanobacteria at the strain level yoshida et al 2008 thus it would be advisable to look for a suitable tool that can provide information on so far not isolated microcystis cyanophages from different families metagenomics seems to be a promissing culture independent approach since it can provide information on the dna sequences of a entire collection of viral genomes present in a given environment nishimura et al 2017 the acquired genetic data on cyanophages from different families specific for cyanobacteria from microcystis sp could be used for analyses of their entire composition in further environmental analyses beyond this abiotic conditions e g physicochemical parameters of water hydrological conditions weather should be analysed concurrently with genetic analysis in various ecosystems around the world this data could indicate the major factors affecting the lytic lysogenic capabilities of cyanophages thus allowing a more accurate assessment of the effect of cyanophages on their hosts stough et al 2017 5 conclusions microcystis is a genus of planktonic cyanobacteria which has a large share in freshwater blooms worldwide wichelen et al 2016 however its biology ecology and evolution may be influenced by the action of cyanophages information is currently available on seven from eight isolated strains of cyanophages which are capable of lysing microcystis cells these strains represent viruses from myoviridae ma lmm01 and mamv dc strains podoviridae ma lbp φmhi42 and virus like particle strains siphoviridae one virus like particle strain families and corticovirus like particles macv l strain table 1 parker et al 1977 tucker and pollard 2005 yoshida et al 2006 ou et al 2013 hargreaves et al 2013 li et al 2013 watkins et al 2014 so far genome sequences have only been obtained for two strains ma lmm01 and mamv dc based on this information the fragment of the gene encoding the sheath protein g91 was chosen as a suitable molecular marker for studying the population dynamics of dna and rna material of microcystis specific cyanophages in the natural ecosystems of east asia and central europe takashima et al 2007 yoshida et al 2008 mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 this population analysis suggested that a small portion of cyanobacterial populations is permanently infected by cyanophages which appear to be associated with the cyanobacteria rather than affecting their total numbers however infection may shift the cyanobacterial population from cyanophage infection sensitive microcystis in favour of cyanophage infection insensitive individuals in accordance with the killing the winner hypothesis takashima et al 2007 yoshida et al 2008 kimura et al 2012 mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 in addition the expression of the g91 gene by cyanophages in host cells indicated a diurnal infection pattern which was associated with intensified gene expression in the presence of sunlight maximum expression was seen during the afternoon hours and minimum around midnight it was concluded that the diurnal infection pattern could directly result from the dependence of the host cell on photosynthesis process kimura et al 2012 finally particles associated with the host cells were found to be more numerous than those present in the water outside the host kimura et al 2012 additionally the nucleotide sequences of g91 gene fragments isolated from the aquatic ecosystems of central europe showed 95 similarities to the g91 gene fragments of ma lmm01 ma lmm02 ma lmm03 ma hpm05 and mamv dc cyanophages isolated from the freshwater reservoirs of east asia mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 the future direction of the microcystis cyanophage analyses seems to be metagenomics which is culture independent tool for analyzing cyanophages genomes in complex freshwater microbial communities additionally analyses of physicochemical parameters of water hydrological conditions weather etc while tracking the presence of microcystis cyanophages in natural environment could allow for the selection of universal abiotic parameters which enhance the effect of cyanophages on their

1086,the cyanobacteria constitute a diverse group of prokaryotic organisms widespread in aquatic ecosystems microcystis is a genus of freshwater cyanobacteria which poses a possible cause for concern due to its excessive growth and potential for toxin production which can be aggravated by intensive eutrophication of freshwaters and climate changes factors that can potentially affect the biology ecology and evolution of cyanobacteria are cyanophages this paper summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding cyanophages specific to microcystis sp in the natural environment of east asia and central europe being a group of planktonic viruses cyanophages have been studied since the 1960s information on viruses specific to microcystis sp was first obtained in the 1970s and are being dynamically developing over the last two decades there are eight strains of cyanophages capable of lysing microcystis sp cells reported to date belonging to myoviridae podoviridae and siphoviridae families as well as forming corticovirus like particles available literature data indicates that the gene encoding the sheath protein of the contractile tail g91 is a good molecular marker for tracing microcystis viruses from myoviridae as a form of environmental analysis it has been suggested that in natural ecosystems this group of cyanophages can cause a shift in the host population from predominant cyanophage infection sensitive to cyanophage infection insensitive cells rather than influencing the total number of microcystis sp it was found that nucleotide sequence of the g91 gene fragment isolated from central europe was 95 similar to that of its counterparts from east asia however the research based on molecular primers specific to the microcystis sp viruses is limitted to two of the known strains to date it is suggested that further studies in molecular biology and ecology of microcystis sp cyanophages should be based on metagenomics accompanied with physicochemical environmental variables keywords freshwater viruses blue green algae genetic markers co occurrence dynamics 1 introduction the cyanobacteria blue green algae is a group of heterogeneous bacteria which colonize even the most unfavourable aquatic environments from thermal reservoirs swamps and glacial meltwater streams to ice capped lakes the group has most likely been in existence for over 3 5 billion years during which time its members have gained various adaptations including the ability to conduct oxygenic photosynthesis and the potential for nitrogen fixation or toxin production whitton and potts 2002 komárek 2006 berman frank et al 2003 one of their representatives is the genus microcystis a gas vacuolate and planktonic cyanobacterium which is commonly found around the world in freshwater environments with increased numbers of trophic levels chorus and bartram 1999 harke et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 the possibility of a rapid growth of its biomass and the potential of some species strains to produce hepatotoxins such as microcystin raises concerns from users of the water bodies in which it occurs scientific reports have shown that some microcystis populations are permanently loaded with viral infections yoshida et al 2010 xia et al 2013 mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 aquatic viruses comprise the largest group of pathogens affecting microbial and higher organisms in freshwater and marine environments as well as their influence on the biological and ecological processes evolution and mortality of their hosts they also influence biogeochemical and nutrient cycling one particularly significant group of aquatic viruses is the cyanophages a group of viruses acting as infective agents of cyanobacteria hargreaves et al 2013 the first information regarding such viruses was obtained during the 1960s safferman and morris 1963 however more precise data of cyanophages infecting cyanobacteria of the genus microcystis was obtained in the seventies safferman et al 1969 fox et al 1976 since then there have been many reports about research on microcystis cyanophages but there are no documents summarizing the information about them thus the purpose of this review is to present current state of knowledge about isolated microcystis cyanophages and molecular studies demonstrating their mutual occurrence with host in freshwater environments 2 current knowledge about cyanophage strains specific to microcystis sp the first described virus specific for microcystis sp was sm 1 it was classified as a phycovirus based on its polyhedral capsid and lack of visible tail it was also found to be a double stranded dna virus with a diameter of around 88nm safferman et al 1969 the next microcystis virus to be identified was labelled sm 2 and its morphology placed it in the siphoviridae family it was found to bear a polyhedral head with a diameter of around 50 55nm measured from edge to edge and a non contractile and flexible tail measuring 130 140nm in length fox et al 1976 however later findings indicated that strains sm 1 and sm 2 were cyanophages specific to synechococcus sp suttle 2002 yoshida et al 2006 following this parker et al 1977 reported that chaplinskaya and goryushin 1966 data not available isolated the ma 1 cyanophage specific for microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa microcystis pulverea and microcystis musciola outdated name fifteen years later tucker and pollard 2005 isolated cyanophage ma lbp from an australian tank which was found to infect m aeruginosa this virus had a t7 like morphology with a short stubby tail and a capsid diameter of 42nm for ma lbpa or 52nm for ma lbpb placing ma lbp in the family podoviridae table 1 additionally the burst size was estimated at 28 cyanophages per host cell and the latent period was calculated as 11 2h one year later yoshida et al 2006 reported the isolation of the ma lmm01 cyanophage from a japanese freshwater reservoir numerous studies have since led to a greater understanding of its morphological structure and genetic characteristics and have clarified its ecological impact on its host the cyanobacteria of the genus microcystis yoshida et al 2008 yoshida et al 2010 kimura et al 2012 kimura et al 2013 kimura sakai 2014 this cyanophage was classified as a member of myoviridae by its icosahedral head and contractile tail the diameter of the head was estimated as 86nm and the maximum length of the tail as 209nm table 1 in addition the cyanophage burst size and latent period were indicated at 50 120 infectious units per cell and 6 12h respectively yoshida et al 2006 its genome was found to be 162109bp in length and displayed no homologous genes to known cyanophages however some of its genes were found to be highly similar to cyanobacterial genes e g genes of the ribonucleotide reductase and nonbleaching protein a gene this similarity suggested that horizontal gene transfer may take place between cyanophages specific to microcystis cyanobacteria and their hosts yoshida et al 2008 the next well established microcystis phage was mamv dc which was isolated from a chinese water body between 2013 and 2015 it was found to have an isometrically symmetrical capsid with a diameter of 70nm and a tail with a length of 160nm these features placed the cyanophage within the myoviridae family table 1 the virus burst size was found to be about 80 infectious units per cell its latent period between 24 and 48h and the length of its genome 169223bp sequence analysis of the phage genome confirmed that horizontal gene transfer had taken place between it and its cyanobacterial host ou et al 2013 2015 it should be mentioned that virus like particles able to infect microcystis sp have also been successfully isolated from the lake sediment in the united kingdom hargreaves et al 2013 and these were classified into the podoviridae and spihoviridae families the particles representing the podoviridae were round capsids with a diameter of 52nm without any apparent tail structure while those representing the spihoviridae family had a capsid with a diameter of 84nm and a tail 158nm in length table 1 in addition corticovirus like cyanophage particles have also been isolated from a chinese reservoir li et al 2013 they were found to have a round capsid with isohedral symmetry and a diameter ranging from 47nm to 53nm table 1 in addition a further microcystis cyanophage named φmhi42 has been isolated from an aqueous environment in the united kingdom φmhi42 has been classified as a member of the podoviridae family it comprises a capsid with a diameter ranging from 100nm to 120nm and a non contractile short tail table 1 watkins et al 2014 3 molecular studies on microcystis cyanophages demonstrating their dynamics in the natural environment studies of most microcystis cyanophages have provided information regarding their isolation their morphological features and their taxonomic affiliation determinations of their numbers and burst size and descriptions of their host interactions under controlled laboratory conditions among other things however the genome has been characterized in only two strains ma lmm01 and mamv dc the first molecular marker i e specific gene intended for the detection and quantification of cyanophages was designed for the strain ma lmm01 it was designed by takashima et al 2007 based on the ma lmm01 genome three genes encoding the proteins of the sheath protein g91 as well as the alpha and beta subunits of ribonucleotide reductase were chosen for sequencing together with their immediate up and down stream regions following this the sequences of these genes from the ma lmm01 phage were compared with their counterparts in three other myoviridae clonal isolates of ma lmm02 and ma lmm03 acquired from lake mikata japan and of ma hpm05 from hirosawanoike pond japan although the hosts of ma lmm02 ma lmm03 and ma hpm05 were not specified all three isolates appeared to be closely related to the ma lmm01 cyanophage based on their sequence similarities a characteristic genome sequence known as ma lmm01 type was designed with the sequence known the conserved sequences of the cyanophage type g91 gene fragment i e the gene encoding the sheath protein were chosen as a molecular marker the primer sheathrtf sheathrtr sheathrt table 2 and real time pcr specifications were proposed takashima et al 2007 these findings have since allowed the detection and quantitative analysis of dna and rna material of cyanophages associated with microcystis cyanobacteria in natural aquatic environments 3 1 dynamic changes in gene copy number in east asia the first analyses of cyanophages specific to microcystis cyanobacteria in the natural environment were conducted in east asia yoshida et al 2008 made the first description of the population dynamics of microcysis phages and of their hosts by examining the conserved fragments of the g91 gene for the former and those of the phycocyanin intergenic spacer pc igs gene for the latter in addition they also described the dynamics of potentially toxigenic populations of hosts by examining the occurrence of the mcya gene the examinations were conducted from april to december in 2006 in lake mikata japan the detected numbers of g91 gene fragments ranged from 1 1 102 to 1 1 104 copiesml 1 with an exception found during the beginning of april when the copy number was below the detection limit in the case of the pc igs gene fragment the amount was between 2 7 101 and 2 0 105 copiesml 1 and was not detected on december while the numbers of mcya gene copies ml 1 ranged from 5 2 101 to 2 1 103 in addition correlation analysis suggested that the microcystis phage was an important factor in determining the population dynamics of its host and might be the cause of a shift in composition towards non microcystin producing populations the killing the winner hypothesis indicates that cyanophage infections of cyanobacteria can result in the replacement of cyanophage sensitive populations with cyanophage insensitive populations a subsequent report by yoshida et al 2010 examined the dynamics of the g91 gene fragment and the cyanobacterial gene fragments pc igs and mcya over a longer period of time the analysis was conducted between may and november in the years 2006 2007 and 2008 in hirosawanoike pond japan during this period the gene copy numbers of phages ranged between 1 5 100 ml 1 and 1 7 103 ml 1 with the cyanobacterial gene copy numbers of pc igs and mcya ranging from 1 3 103 ml 1 to 5 8 108 ml 1 and 2 5 102 ml 1 to 2 1 107 ml 1 respectively no clear relationship was found between the phage g91 gene and pc igs microcystis gene in addition the number of infected host cells was estimated to be lower than the total number of microcystis cells ranging from 0 01 to 2 9cellsml 1 the calculation was made using the equation i c b where c was the cyanophages number per ml at sampling time and b was the burst size of ma lmm01 which suggested that only a small percentage of the microcystis sp population might be infected however the authors suggest that in this case the cyanophages may have been a factor which temporary influenced the shift in composition of different microcystis sp populations xia et al 2013 examined the population dynamic of microcystis cyanophages represented by the g91 gene fragment and microcystis sp represented by the pc igs gene fragment from may 2012 to april 2013 in east lake china the findings indicated that the g91 gene copy number ranged between 7 16 10 1 ml 1 and 2 53 105 ml 1 and the pc igs copy number from 5 43 103 to 8 39 105 ml 1 despite the similar population dynamics and significant abundance correlation between phage and cyanobacteria genes the authors emphasize that three different types of m aeruginosa were detected during the study of which only some were susceptible to the ma lmm01 type phage in a study in hirosawanoike pond japan kimura et al 2012 examined whether infection with ma lmm01 like type cyanophages is closely related to the day night cycle the study used quantitative real time pcr to determine the abundance of the pc igs gene corresponding to m aeruginosa number and the number of g91 gene copies per ml of water corresponding to the number of free phage particles in the water based on dna material g91 dna and phages associated with the host cell based on dna g91 dna and rna material g91 rna samples were taken every 3h starting from 9 over 24 h sampling periods sampling was performed twice in autumn 2009 in addition the occurrence of the pc igs gene represented m aeruginosa and of the g91 gene representing the cyanophage was determined based on sampling performed once per month during the spring to autumn period 2009 the results of the two diel analysis indicate that approximately 106 copies of the pc igs gene representing the cyanobacteria were present per ml with a peak occurring at 03 00 for both sampling periods in contrast the concentration of g91 representing the free virus fraction ranged from 102 to 103 ml 1 during the first sampling period with a peak visible between 15 00 and 18 00 with other peaks visible at 00 00 and between 03 00 and 06 00 during the second sampling period the g91 gene copy fragment number representing the number of cyanophages in the host cell reached a maximum between 104 and 106 ml 1 with peaks visible at 15 00 and 21 00 during the first sampling period and peaks between 12 00 and 15 00 and at 03 00 during the second sampling period additionally g91 replication peaked at 12 00 relative abundance 0 0051 and reached the lowest value at 03 00 relative abundance 0 0007 during the first sampling period with a similar pattern of replication observed for the second sampling day kimura et al 2012 suggest that the peaks of the cyanophage g91 dna observed in both fractions during the afternoon may be the result of active cyanophage production and attribute the night time peaks to the accumulation of microcystis sp biomass as virions may remain trapped by the remains of the host cell or its colonies and only small amounts can diffuse into the water the viral infection of cyanobacteria may occur according to a diel cycle this cycle may be influenced by the presence of light which influences the intracellular transformations of cyanobacteria associated with photosynthesis further analysis identified between 6 1 104 and 3 9 107 copies of the pc igs gene fragment of the analyzed cyanobacteria per ml of water during the spring autumn period in addition during the study the concentration of g91 gene fragments representing the number free particles of cyanophages per ml of water ranged from undetectable to 8 2 102 whereas the numbers of viruses present in the host cell ranged from 2 5 101 to 1 6 106 kimura et al 2012 note considerably fewer g91 gene copies in the free phage fraction than in the host cell fraction additionally similar trends were observed for cyanophage and cyanobacteria numbers suggesting that part of the cyanobacteria population is continually infected by cyanophages tail pcr thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr using g91 f g91 r primers table 2 and sequencing of sample dna was performed to allow clonal analysis of the g91 gene fragments in the fractions of free cyanophages cyanophages present in host cells and rna fractions kimura et al 2012 based on these findings 87 sequences of the g91 gene were classified into 71 genotypes maximum parsimony network analysis was then performed to divide the obtained genotypes into three sequence groups group i consisting of 62 genotypes group ii consisting of seven genotypes and group iii consisting of two genotypes it was also found that the previously isolated ma lmm01 cyanophage was genetically distinct from these groups kimura et al 2012 however kimura sakai et al 2014 later classified ma lmm01 to group iii it was thus indicated that the above mentioned sheathrt primers could be used as tools for the detection of ma lmm01 like cyanophages also from group iii and that the true amount of ma lmm01 like cyanophages specific for microcystis may be underestimated therefore a new primer set called g91 drtpf1 g91 drtpr2 was designed by kimura sakai et al 2014 these primers were based on 434 sequences representing 43 genotypes present in more than two clones of ma lmm01 like type cyanophages obtained by kimura et al 2013 and could be used for amplification of 206bp g91 gene fragments table 2 targeting genotype groups i iii the samples were also subjected to quantitative real time pcr qpcr analysis using old and new primers kimura sakai et al 2014 changes in cyanophage level were estimated based on the number of g91 genes per ml of sample taken from hirosawanoike pond japan between april and november 2010 the material was tested in two variants as cyanophage particles present in water and cyanophages present in host cells sheathrt primer analyses found the concentrations of g91 gene fragments representing the numbers of cyanophages present in the water remained below the detection limit throughout the study period in turn the concentration of g91 gene fragments representing cyanophages present in the host cell remained low from april to august with a clear increase to 6 8 105 in early october the analyses with the new primers found the numbers of g91 gene fragments representing the numbers of free cyanophages to remain within the range 2 8 103 to 2 0 104 ml 1 throughout the analysis period the copy numbers of g91 gene fragments representing cyanophages presented in host cells remained between 3 2 102 and 4 0 103 ml 1 from april to july increasing from august to november with a maximum of 7 0 105 in early october in addition the sequences of the amplified g91 gene fragment obtained with the use of newly designed primers were mostly conservative kimura sakai et al 2014 conclude that the newly designed primers for the amplification of g91 gene fragment of ma lmm01 like type cyanophages allow greater detection of related viruses from groups i iii the best examples were the above mentioned analyses of the free virus fraction in water more importantly no gene copies were detectable with the use of the sheathrt primers with the new primers the numbers of copies of g91 gene fragments were found in the range of 103 104 ml 1 the authors also note that qpcr analyses of the g91 ml 1 gene based on new primers may underestimate the true number of analyzed cyanophages due to the existence of yet undiscovered viruses related to ma lmm01 cyanophages in the natural environment 3 2 dynamic changes in the genes copy number in area of central europe similar research has also been conducted in central europe one such study performed in the sulejów reservoir in poland examined the population dynamics of microcystis cyanobacteria and their toxigenic strains by assaying 16s rrna and mcya gene fragment copy numbers as well as microcystis specific cyanophage numbers represented by the g91 gene fragment during five consecutive spring and autumn seasons in the years 2009 2013 mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 sheathrt primers were used to amplify the g91 gene the results relative values indicated that the 16s rrna copy numbers fell from 6 85 106 ml 1 in 2009 to 2 22 107 ml 1 in 2011 while mcya copy number fell from 3 82 104 ml 1 in 2012 to 1 15 107 in 2011ml 1 mean g91 gene fragment copy number fell from 2 62 104 ml 1 in 2009 to 1 44 106 ml 1 in 2010 mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 indicated that generally the cyanophages appeared simultaneously or after the appearance of the genus microcystis including toxic genotypes and accompanied them until the end of each season the highest number of cyanophages was found in 2010 when a water bloom developed as a result of stabilization of hydrological conditions an increase in temperature and the presence of optimal nutrient concentrations for the development of blue green algae further studies performed in this polish waterbody sequenced the viral sheath protein encoding the g91 gene based on sanger technology the obtained data showed 95 homology 100 query coverage with cyanophage strains ma lmm01 ma lmm02 ma lmm03 and ma hpm05 classified as myoviridae isolated from freshwater in japan in addition the blast analysis also identified homologies with an mamv dc strain of myoviridae isolated from a chinese reservoir mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 yoshida et al 2008 ou et al 2013 these analyses of the dynamics of the co occurrence of microcystis represented by 16s rrna and mcya gene fragments and cyanophages represented by the g91 gene fragment were continued in the spring autumn seasons of 2014 and 2015 in the sulejów and jeziorsko reservoirs fig 1 in accordance with the methodology described by mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 in the sulejów reservoir the copy number of the 16s rrna gene fragment was both higher 2 57 108 ml 1 and lower 2 39 104 ml 1 in 2014 than 2015 in turn the mcya gene fragment was more abundant 3 18 107 ml 1 in the 2014 season but least below the detection limit i e 2 00 104 ml 1 in 2015 the g91 gene fragment had its highest 2 93 106 ml 1 and lowest below the detection limit i e 2 00 104 ml 1 copy numbers in 2014 the mean copy numbers of 16s rrna mcya and g91 gene fragments were 107 105 to 106 105 respectively table 3 in the case of jeziorsko reservoir 16s rrna gene copy number peaked at 4 27 109 in 2015 and reached its lowest value below the detection limit i e 2 00 104 ml 1 2014 mcya gene fragment copy number was also the highest in 2015 8 06 108 ml 1 and the lowest below detection limit in 2014 g91 gene copy number reached 3 58 107 in 2014 with a minimum value below the detection level the mean values for the number of copies of the 16s rrna mcya g91 gene fragments were 108 107to 108 and 106 to 107 respectively table 3 typically 10 100 times more copies of the gene fragments were obtained from the jeziorsko reservoir than the sulejów reservoir this difference has been attributed to differences in the place and method of taking samples samples from the sulejów reservoir were taken from the water column in the area of the open part of the reservoir while samples from the jeziorsko reservoir were taken from the surface of the water 0 0 5m from a small bay where the water bloom accumulated in addition the dynamics analyses indicated that cyanophage levels accompanied those of cyanobacteria in the water of both reservoirs usually from the beginning of the spring season to the end of the autumn season in 2014 and 2015 fig 2 although the cyanophages and cyanobacteria including their toxigenic strains of the sulejów reservoir shared similar population dynamics in 2014 their numbers diverged between 02 july and 21 august 2015 as well as between 18 september and 16 november 2015 this could be explained by the killing the winner hypothesis fig 2 in this case the antagonistic relationship should be understood as an increasing peak in the number of cyanophages with a simultaneous decrease in the amount of cyanobacteria this is followed by a decrease in the number of cyanophages which may be accompanied by an increase in the number of cyanobacteria no clear correlation was found between the dynamics of occurrence of cyanophages and toxigenic microsystis cyanobacteria in either reservoir in the period 2014 2015 fig 2 however in the jeziorsko reservoir antagonistic relationships occurred between 07 july and 04 august and again from 24 august to 14 october during the 2014 season in the 2015 season cyanophage numbers reflected cyanobacterial numbers without any apparent antagonistic relationships fig 2 these findings from the two reservoirs during the spring and autumn seasons 2014 and 2015 also support yoshida et al 2010 and mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 who propose that viruses specific for blue green algae may co exist with their host rather than influence their total number however the antagonistic events might result from a shift in cyanobacterial population type according to the killing the winner hypothesis yoshida et al 2008 kimura et al 2013 kimura sakai et al 2014 4 future direction of microcystis cyanophages research presented molecular base studies on dynamics of cyanophages specific for microcystis were indirectly possible by successfully characterized genome of ma lmm01 cyanophage strain from myoviridae family which was isolated from the natural environment takashima et al 2007 yoshida et al 2008 therefore the freshwater dynamic analyses are limited only to the one type of microcystis phage from one particular family without the possibility of estimation the entire community of mentioned viruses kimura et al 2012 kimura sakai et al 2014 isolation of cyanophages from the environment together with its genome characterization is difficult and time consuming especially that cyanophages can be host specific targeting cyanobacteria at the strain level yoshida et al 2008 thus it would be advisable to look for a suitable tool that can provide information on so far not isolated microcystis cyanophages from different families metagenomics seems to be a promissing culture independent approach since it can provide information on the dna sequences of a entire collection of viral genomes present in a given environment nishimura et al 2017 the acquired genetic data on cyanophages from different families specific for cyanobacteria from microcystis sp could be used for analyses of their entire composition in further environmental analyses beyond this abiotic conditions e g physicochemical parameters of water hydrological conditions weather should be analysed concurrently with genetic analysis in various ecosystems around the world this data could indicate the major factors affecting the lytic lysogenic capabilities of cyanophages thus allowing a more accurate assessment of the effect of cyanophages on their hosts stough et al 2017 5 conclusions microcystis is a genus of planktonic cyanobacteria which has a large share in freshwater blooms worldwide wichelen et al 2016 however its biology ecology and evolution may be influenced by the action of cyanophages information is currently available on seven from eight isolated strains of cyanophages which are capable of lysing microcystis cells these strains represent viruses from myoviridae ma lmm01 and mamv dc strains podoviridae ma lbp φmhi42 and virus like particle strains siphoviridae one virus like particle strain families and corticovirus like particles macv l strain table 1 parker et al 1977 tucker and pollard 2005 yoshida et al 2006 ou et al 2013 hargreaves et al 2013 li et al 2013 watkins et al 2014 so far genome sequences have only been obtained for two strains ma lmm01 and mamv dc based on this information the fragment of the gene encoding the sheath protein g91 was chosen as a suitable molecular marker for studying the population dynamics of dna and rna material of microcystis specific cyanophages in the natural ecosystems of east asia and central europe takashima et al 2007 yoshida et al 2008 mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 this population analysis suggested that a small portion of cyanobacterial populations is permanently infected by cyanophages which appear to be associated with the cyanobacteria rather than affecting their total numbers however infection may shift the cyanobacterial population from cyanophage infection sensitive microcystis in favour of cyanophage infection insensitive individuals in accordance with the killing the winner hypothesis takashima et al 2007 yoshida et al 2008 kimura et al 2012 mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 in addition the expression of the g91 gene by cyanophages in host cells indicated a diurnal infection pattern which was associated with intensified gene expression in the presence of sunlight maximum expression was seen during the afternoon hours and minimum around midnight it was concluded that the diurnal infection pattern could directly result from the dependence of the host cell on photosynthesis process kimura et al 2012 finally particles associated with the host cells were found to be more numerous than those present in the water outside the host kimura et al 2012 additionally the nucleotide sequences of g91 gene fragments isolated from the aquatic ecosystems of central europe showed 95 similarities to the g91 gene fragments of ma lmm01 ma lmm02 ma lmm03 ma hpm05 and mamv dc cyanophages isolated from the freshwater reservoirs of east asia mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 the future direction of the microcystis cyanophage analyses seems to be metagenomics which is culture independent tool for analyzing cyanophages genomes in complex freshwater microbial communities additionally analyses of physicochemical parameters of water hydrological conditions weather etc while tracking the presence of microcystis cyanophages in natural environment could allow for the selection of universal abiotic parameters which enhance the effect of cyanophages on their

1087,we tested the effects of turbidity on the prey consumption by larvae of an endemic predator ambystoma mexicanum and an introduced predator oreochromis niloticus prey visibility is influenced by turbidity due to organic algae detritus or inorganic sediment matter we hypothesized that the axolotl would be more adversely influenced by high turbidity as compared to tilapia resulting in a decrease in the population of the former under natural conditions in order to test this we conducted prey preference experiments and tested the reactive distance of both predators at different turbidity levels prey species used were the cladocerans alona glabra moina macrocopa macrothrix triserialis and simocephalus vetulus and the ostracod heterocypris incongruens in both clear and turbid waters the fish consumed about 17 5 and 2 5 respectively more prey the axolotl had a greater preference for h incongruens and m triserialis and the fish for s vetulus and m triserialis these results indicate that turbidity decreases the visual ability during the larval stages of a mexicanum which in turn influences its capacity to compete against the invasive fish implications of these results on conservation efforts for the highly endangered ambystoma mexicanum are discussed keywords axolotl tilapia cladocerans feeding ecology inorganic turbidity 1 introduction anthropogenic eutrophication and deforestation have resulted in increased turbidity in water bodies worldwide rabalais 2002 dudgeon et al 2006 in aquatic systems there are four main types of substances algae detritus organic matter and silt inorganic or mineral suspended sediments and dissolved matter all of which affect water transparency eutrophication and resulting algal blooms as well as sediment from littoral erosion and resuspension of bottom sediments due to mixing by the wind result in an increase in turbidity and a decrease in visibility de robertis et al 2003 in murky waters suspended particles such as sand and plankton reduce horizontal and vertical visibility of 60 m in clear water to only a few centimeters sandström 1999 shoup and wahl 2009 despite the generally dark underwater conditions most zooplankton predators depend on vision as their main source of sensory information baumgartner et al 2012 thus increased turbidity has a negative effect on aquatic organisms that depend on prey visibility for adequate nutrition utne palm 2002 gliwicz 2003 kemp et al 2011 the negative effect of turbidity on hunting of predators depends on the type of prey size contrast and the behaviour of the prey for instance zaret 1980 has shown that the size of the ocellus in cladocerans determines its vulnerability to fish predation the axolotl ambystoma mexicanum is a highly endangered species and faces a considerable threat in its native habitat lake xochimilco due to two main factors poor water quality and the introduced cichlid oreochromis niloticus tilapia contreras macbeath et al 2014 nandini et al 2016 the density of o niloticus is two orders of magnitude greater than the density of a mexicanum in lake of xochimilco contreras macbeath et al 2014 the high fish predation pressure has also resulted in a dominance of small 300 µm zooplankton especially rotifers in lake xochimilco nandini et al 2016 for which even larval axolotl have little dietary preference chaparro herrera et al 2013 tilapia being an omnivore competes directly with the axolotl for food during different stages of their growth damages the eggs and larvae of the amphibian and increases the turbidity of the medium while browsing zambrano et al 2006 amphibian and fish predators largely depend on prey visibility for feeding previous studies show that oreochromis niloticus and ambystoma mexicanum select their food items based on size nutritional quality and vulnerability to capture zambrano et al 2006 chaparro herrera et al 2011 however factors such as turbidity limit their capture success e g by decreasing the reactive distance sweka and hartman 2001 meager et al 2006 under optimal conditions predators choose the largest prey in relation to their gape size gill 2003 turbidity interferes with the capture of appropriate zooplankton and thus predators such as o niloticus and a mexicanum are forced to feed on less adequate prey in terms of size and nutritional quality zooplankton is the main diet of a mexicanum larvae chaparro herrera et al 2011 this amphibian native to lake xochimilco is endangered to the point of extinction in its natural habitat and one of the reasons is water quality lake xochimilco receives partially treated waste water and the prey consumption by a mexicanum is lower in contaminated medium as compared to clean water while tilapia is less affected under similar conditions chaparro herrera et al 2013 since prey consumption by tilapia is significantly higher than that by a mexicanum zambrano et al 2010 this amphibian faces stress both due to the deterioration of the habitat and competitive pressure from the non native fish considering the shallow depth of lake xochimilco and the frequent resuspension of sediments as a result of rain wind or fish feeding merlo galeazzi and zambrano 2014 combined with the low acuity of vision in a mexicanum it is possible that turbidity has a significant impact on prey consumption in this study we tested the effect of water turbidity on prey consumption preference and capture distance of prey by a mexicanum compared to the introduced fish o niloticus previous studies indicate that a mexicanum is visually weak compared with o niloticus tilapia the compounded adverse effect of turbidity would reduce the prey consumption of the endangered amphibian thus increasing its risk of extinction 2 material and methods 2 1 obtaining and maintaining ambystoma mexicanum fertilized eggs about 400 from one breeding pair of ambystoma mexicanum obtained from the laboratory of herpetology vivario at the faculty of higher studies iztacala of the national autonomous university of mexico were incubated at 15 18 c at a light dark regime of 12 12 h 740 lux these individuals have been maintained under laboratory conditions for the past twenty years wild ambystoma mexicanum were not used because of two reasons i a mexicanum is a protected species therefore it is not permitted to capture animals from lake xochimilco and ii the population density in the wild is less than 100 per hectare 2 2 obtaining and maintaining oreochromis niloticus we obtained 400 newborn o niloticus larvae from the aquaculture laboratory of the acuexcomat environmental education center mexico city the larvae were kept at room temperature of 18 22 c with a photoperiod of 12 12 h the adult fish were maintained in captivity for more than five years ten percent of the larvae died during the first week but the remaining individuals survived until the end of the study period we separately maintained the larvae of both the predators using moderately hard water as the medium epa medium which was prepared by dissolving 0 095 g nahco3 0 06 g caso4 0 06 g mgso4 and 0 002 g kcl in one litre of distilled water our personal observations indicate that hard water prevents the growth of fungus on the skin of the axolotl the use of the same culture medium for the predator and the prey also helped avoid stress during the experiments the larvae were placed in shallow transparent trays and were fed ad libitum on a mixture of rotifers and cladocerans 2 3 preparation of sediments we took 400 g of bottom sediments of lake xochimilco in march dry season and placed it in 800 ml of water with sodium hypochlorite 5 available chlorine to remove the organic matter the mixture was boiled for 1 h and then allowed to stand until the precipitated sediment and the supernatant was removed the resulting sediment was subjected to the above procedure twice the sediment thus obtained was resuspended in distilled water and centrifuged for 3 min at 2000 rpm centrifuge brand boeco mod c 28 discarding the supernatant the pellet obtained was resuspended in distilled water again this procedure was repeated 3 4 times following garcía garcía et al 2006 finally all sediments were re suspended and allowed to stand for about 1 min to remove large particles such as sand which settles rapidly and is not appropriate for conducting bioassays subsequently the supernatant was removed which was used as the stock solution this solution was stored at 4 c and was used in all experiments to guarantee that the sediments used did not contain any toxic agent that could be released into the environment and thus affect the development of the test organisms bioassays were conducted the day prior to the experiments using moina macrocopa using five replicates to evaluate mortality of the organisms the sediment was non toxic and all the test cladocerans were alive 2 4 preparation of sediments in ex situ experiments we first analyzed the turbidity levels in lake xochimilco for which we took 100 ml of water and transported it to the laboratory at 4 c in a container a week before conducting the experiments a sample was analyzed and the particle size of the suspended sediment was analyzed by the hydrometer method garcía garcía et al 2006 we quantified the turbidity of water from lake xochimilco with a cole parmer model 08391 40 turbidimeter obtaining a turbidity of 32 4 ntu for the experiments we adjusted the turbidity to the level found in lake xochimilco 2 5 food preference in turbid medium prey preference experiments using zooplankton were conducted during the first eight weeks of the amphibian and tilapia the larvae of the test organisms were 0 45 cm in the beginning and grew to 3 45 cm by the end of the study eighth week experiments were carried out weekly to analyze the impact of water turbidity on preference and consumption of zooplankton by a mexicanum and o niloticus we placed 50 ml of turbid medium in 250 ml recepients the medium was prepared by adding 357 ml of epa to 43 ml of sediment prepared as described above the medium was prepared for four replicate treatments each with either axolotl or tilapia experiments were conducted in fluorescent light and at 21 2 c the range recorded in lake xochimilco nandini et al 2005 as controls we used clear epa medium also with four replicates for each species experiments were conducted in 250 ml containers with 50 ml of test medium and with 50 individuals of each prey or 10 of each for a total of 50 we offered cladocerans moina macrocopa alona glabra simocephalus vetulus and macrothrix triserialis and ostracods heterocypris incongruens to both the predators the movement of the predator in the shallow containers kept the prey evenly distributed during the experiments the larval amphibian and fish were separately starved for two hours prior to the experiments the number of ingested prey was determined based on the difference between the initial and final prey we also measured the prey size length and width of 10 randomly selected indivduals of each zooplankton species table 1 prey preference was calculated using manly s α as shown below krebs 1999 α i ri ni 1 σ rj nj where σα i 1 0 where αi preference index manly s alpha for the type of prey i ri rj the ratio prey species i and j in the diet consumed by the predator ni nj the ratio prey species i and j in the medium i and j 1 2 3 m m number of potential prey species if α 1 m then the prey species i is preferred in the diet and if α 1 m the species of prey i is avoided in the diet 2 6 predator movement behaviour we marked glass containers of 18 cm diameter 8 cm depth and 500 ml capacity at 5 7 5 10 and 15 cm each week starting from week 4 we observed the distance that a mexicanum and oreochromis niloticus moved while capturing their prey see fig 1 this movement was compared in turbid water 34 ntu and clear water control we placed in the center of the container one appropriately aged individual of a mexicanum or oreochromis niloticus larva with 100 individuals of moina macrocopa most prey and the predator were on the same plane for 20 min we observed the distance from the center at which they prey was captured marked on a sheet of paper with the same pattern as the bottom of the test vessel ten observations for each predator were made per week and later the data was analyzed statistically for the differences among the treatments 3 results 3 1 food preference in turbid medium we observed marked differences among the treatments in relation to prey preferences fig 2 ambystoma mexicanum preferred alona and ostracods during the first week regardless of the turbidity over time the preference for these taxa was more in turbid than in the clear media where the predator consumed the cladocerans macrothrix moina and simocephalus more fig 2 predation habits of ambystoma and tilapia in weeks 2 8 are similar ἀ 1 0 2 whilst dissimilar during the 1st week fig 2 tilapia larvae also preferred alona and ostracods during the first week a bray curtis analysis 1957 showed that unlike the axolotl fish showed a generalist trend in its prey preference with no distinct preference for any taxa regardless of the turbidity in the medium prey consumption by larval a mexicanum during the experimental period varied depending on the taxa offered fig 3 for instance consumption of m triserialis was higher in clear rather than turbid media prey consumption by a mexicanum was in the order h incongruens m triserialis a glabra m macrocopa s vetulus among all prey offered a mexicanum fed most on h incongruens the maximum prey consumption by larval o niloticus during the experimental period depended on the prey taxa fig 4 it was 2 5 more than that of the native a mexicanum among the cladocerans m triserialis was consumed in highest numbers in clear and turbid medium however as compared to treatments in the clear medium the consumption of crustacean prey in the turbid medium was much lower oreochromis niloticus showed in decreasing order of maximal cladoceran prey consumption m triserialis m macrocopa a glabra s vetulus among all the prey items offered o niloticus consumption remained nearly the same during the eight weeks it fed mainly on the larger microcrustaceans there is a dissimilarity between control and turbid conditions for these predators figs 3 and 4 prey size increased as the larvae grew the increase in body size and prey size consumed with time was greater for o niloticus than for a mexicanum fig 5 3 2 predator movement behaviour the reactive distance by a mexicanum and o niloticus analysed separately also differed significantly fig 6 shows that the distance at which a mexicanum could capture prey decreased by about 50 in turbid waters for example at the 8th week the capture distance in the controls clear medium was about 7 cm while in the turbid medium capture distance was about 4 cm on the other hand o niloticus fig 6 at week eight could capture prey at a distance of 8 cm but in clear water it could capture prey as far as 16 cm the prey capture data of a mexicanum and m macrocopa is shown in fig 5 area of prey capture is significantly different between test species and conditions table 2 turbidity has a greater adverse effect on prey consumption for a mexicanum than tilapia 4 discussion the results of the feeding experiments were coherent with the hypothesis that when predators axolotl and oreochromis niloticus are fed in the presence of suspended particles in the medium their feeding efficiency decreases we observed a lower feeding rate of the both larval axolotl and tilapia at a turbidity of 32 4 ntu similar to that found in the lake as compared to the clear water controls these tests indicate the use of prey and consequently a better adapted species to the environment a review by dick et al 2014 shows that feeding behaviour can be used to predict the outcome of interactions between species sweka and hartman 2001 demonstrate that fish like cod in turbid waters increase their swimming speed to compensate for the decreased visual range not all organisms respond similarly to increasing turbidity levels granqvist and mattila 2004 have not observed a decrease in feeding efficiency in the mysid shrimp when the turbidity was increased from 1 to 30 ntu and they have suggested that the low effect of turbidity was due to an increase in the contrast with the prey on the other hand knutson et al 2004 have reported that high turbidity reduces the swimming activity in amphibians schmutzer et al 2008 also have reported that high concentrations of turbidity have decreased amphibian populations in natural ponds sediments associated with highly turbid conditions also burden the gills and eggs thereby exerting an adverse effect on the population belsky et al 1999 therefore the high turbidity present in lake xochimilco could reduce the ability of the larval a mexicanum to acquire food resources turbid water influences the visual and non visual senses of a mexicanum and o niloticus however we observed a higher preference for prey by o niloticus fig 3 as compared to a mexicanum fig 2 turbidity can affect the behaviour of prey and predators granqvist and mattila 2004 for example turbidity can protect prey species from predators turbidity reduces the intensity of light thus preventing the selection of prey by predators thereby providing a refuge wissel et al 2003 as previously described by wissel et al 2003 the results of our experiments also showed decreased prey consumption in the test jars with 32 3 ntu turbidity this level of turbidity is common in the natural habitat of a mexicanum and the introduced species o niloticus figs 4 and 5 our study showed the ontogenic changes in prey consumption of a mexicanum and tilapia both the predators selected smaller prey such as alona glabra during the first weeks but could also feed on h incongruens subsequently they fed on larger cladocerans such as macrothrix triserialis and moina macrocopa ending with simocephalus vetulus it appears that in clear water the habitat of the prey rather than its size influences selectivity by these predators however the turbid medium altered this pattern especially where a mexicanum consumed mainly smaller and slow moving benthic prey mainly for small species with slow movements and benthic habits such as a glabra and heterocypris incongruens also a mexicanum was unable to consume large sized prey in turbid media even in the final weeks of the study while such trends were not evident in tilapia which consumed prey with the same rate in turbid as well as in clear medium similar trends have been reported for the fish xenotoca variata where the prey consumption in turbid medium decreased by 75 as compared to clear water manjarrez et al 2015 prey capture by aquatic predators depends on contrast and this in turn varies with factors such as the prey size the level of ambient light and turbidity figueiredo et al 2015 zaret 1980 concluded higher fish predation efficiency on bosmina with a big dark eye in lake gatun panama due to priority of the visual effect here we used prey that varied in size and in movement but the morphological structures contrasting them with the medium were weaker therefore the differences in the prey consumption by the amphibians and the fish in this study was possibly related to the acuity of vision the increase of light intensity has a positive effect upon the visual range of aquatic predators until a certain saturation level denoël et al 2016 delcourt et al 2013 found that larval damselfish showed a reduction in feeding under conditions of low light we found similar trends in the amphibian but not in tilapia which perhaps contributes to its success in turbid waters around the world in both clear and turbid water the fish consumed about 17 5 and 2 5 respectively more prey a 2 5 greater consumption by the fish than the axolotl may be low in a short term study but is considerable when extrapolated to field conditions and the two orders of magnitude difference in the density of tilapia as compared to axolotl in lake xochimilco our study also shows that the prey acuity of a mexicanum is half that of tilapia in both turbid and clear waters the decrease in prey visibility in turbid waters as compared to clear waters was by 43 in larval a mexicanum and 39 in tilapia the adverse effect of back scatter which is more in turbid media has been shown in planktivorous fish fed daphnia spp vinyard and o brien 1976 as well as piscivorous and trout salvelinus namaycush vogel and beauchamp 1999 the visual acuity of fish is superior to that of amphibians mohun and wilkinson 2015 the size of the lens in fish is positively associated with its standard length dobberfuhl et al 2005 fellows 2015 and the visual acuity sharply increases with growth especially during larval and juvenile stages van poorten and walters 2015 our results also show that the reactive distance of tilapia was greater 15 cm than that of the axolotl 8 cm and the longer reactive distance was associated with turbidity more so for the larval amphibian than for fish in nature these differences along with changes in habitat dobberfuhl et al 2005 eventually lead to a competitive pressure on the axolotl several factors reduce the feeding efficiency of axolotls as compared to fish these include the development of limbs thompson et al 2014 poor vision alcaraz et al 2015 and slow swimming rate chaparro herrera et al 2011 sensitivity to toxicants in natural waterbodies can affect the perception of prey especially since these amphbians depend on mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors on their skin kerby et al 2010 the movement of the prey is another factor influencing prey detection barnes and mingolla 2012 this factor is of less importance here because we have not used very fast moving prey such as copepods as the size of the prey increases the stimulus on the retina of the predator also increases thereby decreasing the contrast threshold and an increase in the reaction distance eggers 1977 we found that there is a distinct ontogenic shift in prey preference by the axolotl newly born larvae prefer slow moving small prey while with an increase in age the axolotls prefer larger sized cladocerans which probably provide a greater stimulus for capture freshwater bodies regularly contain high amounts of different types of suspended material that rapidly attenuates to light and changes the spectral range of the available light sato and shichida 2014 experiments show the presence of uv photoreceptors on the ambystomid s retina e g ambystoma tigrinum perry and mcnaughton 1991 found an increase in the sensitivity of 400 450 nm suggesting the presence of photo receptors for uv but not for the infrared range therefore a mexicanum in turbid media perceives less the red color of several zooplanktonic species such as the cladocerans wayne 2012 as a consequence of which it probably captures less prey in nature this also indicates the additional stress on this endangered species due to

1087,we tested the effects of turbidity on the prey consumption by larvae of an endemic predator ambystoma mexicanum and an introduced predator oreochromis niloticus prey visibility is influenced by turbidity due to organic algae detritus or inorganic sediment matter we hypothesized that the axolotl would be more adversely influenced by high turbidity as compared to tilapia resulting in a decrease in the population of the former under natural conditions in order to test this we conducted prey preference experiments and tested the reactive distance of both predators at different turbidity levels prey species used were the cladocerans alona glabra moina macrocopa macrothrix triserialis and simocephalus vetulus and the ostracod heterocypris incongruens in both clear and turbid waters the fish consumed about 17 5 and 2 5 respectively more prey the axolotl had a greater preference for h incongruens and m triserialis and the fish for s vetulus and m triserialis these results indicate that turbidity decreases the visual ability during the larval stages of a mexicanum which in turn influences its capacity to compete against the invasive fish implications of these results on conservation efforts for the highly endangered ambystoma mexicanum are discussed keywords axolotl tilapia cladocerans feeding ecology inorganic turbidity 1 introduction anthropogenic eutrophication and deforestation have resulted in increased turbidity in water bodies worldwide rabalais 2002 dudgeon et al 2006 in aquatic systems there are four main types of substances algae detritus organic matter and silt inorganic or mineral suspended sediments and dissolved matter all of which affect water transparency eutrophication and resulting algal blooms as well as sediment from littoral erosion and resuspension of bottom sediments due to mixing by the wind result in an increase in turbidity and a decrease in visibility de robertis et al 2003 in murky waters suspended particles such as sand and plankton reduce horizontal and vertical visibility of 60 m in clear water to only a few centimeters sandström 1999 shoup and wahl 2009 despite the generally dark underwater conditions most zooplankton predators depend on vision as their main source of sensory information baumgartner et al 2012 thus increased turbidity has a negative effect on aquatic organisms that depend on prey visibility for adequate nutrition utne palm 2002 gliwicz 2003 kemp et al 2011 the negative effect of turbidity on hunting of predators depends on the type of prey size contrast and the behaviour of the prey for instance zaret 1980 has shown that the size of the ocellus in cladocerans determines its vulnerability to fish predation the axolotl ambystoma mexicanum is a highly endangered species and faces a considerable threat in its native habitat lake xochimilco due to two main factors poor water quality and the introduced cichlid oreochromis niloticus tilapia contreras macbeath et al 2014 nandini et al 2016 the density of o niloticus is two orders of magnitude greater than the density of a mexicanum in lake of xochimilco contreras macbeath et al 2014 the high fish predation pressure has also resulted in a dominance of small 300 µm zooplankton especially rotifers in lake xochimilco nandini et al 2016 for which even larval axolotl have little dietary preference chaparro herrera et al 2013 tilapia being an omnivore competes directly with the axolotl for food during different stages of their growth damages the eggs and larvae of the amphibian and increases the turbidity of the medium while browsing zambrano et al 2006 amphibian and fish predators largely depend on prey visibility for feeding previous studies show that oreochromis niloticus and ambystoma mexicanum select their food items based on size nutritional quality and vulnerability to capture zambrano et al 2006 chaparro herrera et al 2011 however factors such as turbidity limit their capture success e g by decreasing the reactive distance sweka and hartman 2001 meager et al 2006 under optimal conditions predators choose the largest prey in relation to their gape size gill 2003 turbidity interferes with the capture of appropriate zooplankton and thus predators such as o niloticus and a mexicanum are forced to feed on less adequate prey in terms of size and nutritional quality zooplankton is the main diet of a mexicanum larvae chaparro herrera et al 2011 this amphibian native to lake xochimilco is endangered to the point of extinction in its natural habitat and one of the reasons is water quality lake xochimilco receives partially treated waste water and the prey consumption by a mexicanum is lower in contaminated medium as compared to clean water while tilapia is less affected under similar conditions chaparro herrera et al 2013 since prey consumption by tilapia is significantly higher than that by a mexicanum zambrano et al 2010 this amphibian faces stress both due to the deterioration of the habitat and competitive pressure from the non native fish considering the shallow depth of lake xochimilco and the frequent resuspension of sediments as a result of rain wind or fish feeding merlo galeazzi and zambrano 2014 combined with the low acuity of vision in a mexicanum it is possible that turbidity has a significant impact on prey consumption in this study we tested the effect of water turbidity on prey consumption preference and capture distance of prey by a mexicanum compared to the introduced fish o niloticus previous studies indicate that a mexicanum is visually weak compared with o niloticus tilapia the compounded adverse effect of turbidity would reduce the prey consumption of the endangered amphibian thus increasing its risk of extinction 2 material and methods 2 1 obtaining and maintaining ambystoma mexicanum fertilized eggs about 400 from one breeding pair of ambystoma mexicanum obtained from the laboratory of herpetology vivario at the faculty of higher studies iztacala of the national autonomous university of mexico were incubated at 15 18 c at a light dark regime of 12 12 h 740 lux these individuals have been maintained under laboratory conditions for the past twenty years wild ambystoma mexicanum were not used because of two reasons i a mexicanum is a protected species therefore it is not permitted to capture animals from lake xochimilco and ii the population density in the wild is less than 100 per hectare 2 2 obtaining and maintaining oreochromis niloticus we obtained 400 newborn o niloticus larvae from the aquaculture laboratory of the acuexcomat environmental education center mexico city the larvae were kept at room temperature of 18 22 c with a photoperiod of 12 12 h the adult fish were maintained in captivity for more than five years ten percent of the larvae died during the first week but the remaining individuals survived until the end of the study period we separately maintained the larvae of both the predators using moderately hard water as the medium epa medium which was prepared by dissolving 0 095 g nahco3 0 06 g caso4 0 06 g mgso4 and 0 002 g kcl in one litre of distilled water our personal observations indicate that hard water prevents the growth of fungus on the skin of the axolotl the use of the same culture medium for the predator and the prey also helped avoid stress during the experiments the larvae were placed in shallow transparent trays and were fed ad libitum on a mixture of rotifers and cladocerans 2 3 preparation of sediments we took 400 g of bottom sediments of lake xochimilco in march dry season and placed it in 800 ml of water with sodium hypochlorite 5 available chlorine to remove the organic matter the mixture was boiled for 1 h and then allowed to stand until the precipitated sediment and the supernatant was removed the resulting sediment was subjected to the above procedure twice the sediment thus obtained was resuspended in distilled water and centrifuged for 3 min at 2000 rpm centrifuge brand boeco mod c 28 discarding the supernatant the pellet obtained was resuspended in distilled water again this procedure was repeated 3 4 times following garcía garcía et al 2006 finally all sediments were re suspended and allowed to stand for about 1 min to remove large particles such as sand which settles rapidly and is not appropriate for conducting bioassays subsequently the supernatant was removed which was used as the stock solution this solution was stored at 4 c and was used in all experiments to guarantee that the sediments used did not contain any toxic agent that could be released into the environment and thus affect the development of the test organisms bioassays were conducted the day prior to the experiments using moina macrocopa using five replicates to evaluate mortality of the organisms the sediment was non toxic and all the test cladocerans were alive 2 4 preparation of sediments in ex situ experiments we first analyzed the turbidity levels in lake xochimilco for which we took 100 ml of water and transported it to the laboratory at 4 c in a container a week before conducting the experiments a sample was analyzed and the particle size of the suspended sediment was analyzed by the hydrometer method garcía garcía et al 2006 we quantified the turbidity of water from lake xochimilco with a cole parmer model 08391 40 turbidimeter obtaining a turbidity of 32 4 ntu for the experiments we adjusted the turbidity to the level found in lake xochimilco 2 5 food preference in turbid medium prey preference experiments using zooplankton were conducted during the first eight weeks of the amphibian and tilapia the larvae of the test organisms were 0 45 cm in the beginning and grew to 3 45 cm by the end of the study eighth week experiments were carried out weekly to analyze the impact of water turbidity on preference and consumption of zooplankton by a mexicanum and o niloticus we placed 50 ml of turbid medium in 250 ml recepients the medium was prepared by adding 357 ml of epa to 43 ml of sediment prepared as described above the medium was prepared for four replicate treatments each with either axolotl or tilapia experiments were conducted in fluorescent light and at 21 2 c the range recorded in lake xochimilco nandini et al 2005 as controls we used clear epa medium also with four replicates for each species experiments were conducted in 250 ml containers with 50 ml of test medium and with 50 individuals of each prey or 10 of each for a total of 50 we offered cladocerans moina macrocopa alona glabra simocephalus vetulus and macrothrix triserialis and ostracods heterocypris incongruens to both the predators the movement of the predator in the shallow containers kept the prey evenly distributed during the experiments the larval amphibian and fish were separately starved for two hours prior to the experiments the number of ingested prey was determined based on the difference between the initial and final prey we also measured the prey size length and width of 10 randomly selected indivduals of each zooplankton species table 1 prey preference was calculated using manly s α as shown below krebs 1999 α i ri ni 1 σ rj nj where σα i 1 0 where αi preference index manly s alpha for the type of prey i ri rj the ratio prey species i and j in the diet consumed by the predator ni nj the ratio prey species i and j in the medium i and j 1 2 3 m m number of potential prey species if α 1 m then the prey species i is preferred in the diet and if α 1 m the species of prey i is avoided in the diet 2 6 predator movement behaviour we marked glass containers of 18 cm diameter 8 cm depth and 500 ml capacity at 5 7 5 10 and 15 cm each week starting from week 4 we observed the distance that a mexicanum and oreochromis niloticus moved while capturing their prey see fig 1 this movement was compared in turbid water 34 ntu and clear water control we placed in the center of the container one appropriately aged individual of a mexicanum or oreochromis niloticus larva with 100 individuals of moina macrocopa most prey and the predator were on the same plane for 20 min we observed the distance from the center at which they prey was captured marked on a sheet of paper with the same pattern as the bottom of the test vessel ten observations for each predator were made per week and later the data was analyzed statistically for the differences among the treatments 3 results 3 1 food preference in turbid medium we observed marked differences among the treatments in relation to prey preferences fig 2 ambystoma mexicanum preferred alona and ostracods during the first week regardless of the turbidity over time the preference for these taxa was more in turbid than in the clear media where the predator consumed the cladocerans macrothrix moina and simocephalus more fig 2 predation habits of ambystoma and tilapia in weeks 2 8 are similar ἀ 1 0 2 whilst dissimilar during the 1st week fig 2 tilapia larvae also preferred alona and ostracods during the first week a bray curtis analysis 1957 showed that unlike the axolotl fish showed a generalist trend in its prey preference with no distinct preference for any taxa regardless of the turbidity in the medium prey consumption by larval a mexicanum during the experimental period varied depending on the taxa offered fig 3 for instance consumption of m triserialis was higher in clear rather than turbid media prey consumption by a mexicanum was in the order h incongruens m triserialis a glabra m macrocopa s vetulus among all prey offered a mexicanum fed most on h incongruens the maximum prey consumption by larval o niloticus during the experimental period depended on the prey taxa fig 4 it was 2 5 more than that of the native a mexicanum among the cladocerans m triserialis was consumed in highest numbers in clear and turbid medium however as compared to treatments in the clear medium the consumption of crustacean prey in the turbid medium was much lower oreochromis niloticus showed in decreasing order of maximal cladoceran prey consumption m triserialis m macrocopa a glabra s vetulus among all the prey items offered o niloticus consumption remained nearly the same during the eight weeks it fed mainly on the larger microcrustaceans there is a dissimilarity between control and turbid conditions for these predators figs 3 and 4 prey size increased as the larvae grew the increase in body size and prey size consumed with time was greater for o niloticus than for a mexicanum fig 5 3 2 predator movement behaviour the reactive distance by a mexicanum and o niloticus analysed separately also differed significantly fig 6 shows that the distance at which a mexicanum could capture prey decreased by about 50 in turbid waters for example at the 8th week the capture distance in the controls clear medium was about 7 cm while in the turbid medium capture distance was about 4 cm on the other hand o niloticus fig 6 at week eight could capture prey at a distance of 8 cm but in clear water it could capture prey as far as 16 cm the prey capture data of a mexicanum and m macrocopa is shown in fig 5 area of prey capture is significantly different between test species and conditions table 2 turbidity has a greater adverse effect on prey consumption for a mexicanum than tilapia 4 discussion the results of the feeding experiments were coherent with the hypothesis that when predators axolotl and oreochromis niloticus are fed in the presence of suspended particles in the medium their feeding efficiency decreases we observed a lower feeding rate of the both larval axolotl and tilapia at a turbidity of 32 4 ntu similar to that found in the lake as compared to the clear water controls these tests indicate the use of prey and consequently a better adapted species to the environment a review by dick et al 2014 shows that feeding behaviour can be used to predict the outcome of interactions between species sweka and hartman 2001 demonstrate that fish like cod in turbid waters increase their swimming speed to compensate for the decreased visual range not all organisms respond similarly to increasing turbidity levels granqvist and mattila 2004 have not observed a decrease in feeding efficiency in the mysid shrimp when the turbidity was increased from 1 to 30 ntu and they have suggested that the low effect of turbidity was due to an increase in the contrast with the prey on the other hand knutson et al 2004 have reported that high turbidity reduces the swimming activity in amphibians schmutzer et al 2008 also have reported that high concentrations of turbidity have decreased amphibian populations in natural ponds sediments associated with highly turbid conditions also burden the gills and eggs thereby exerting an adverse effect on the population belsky et al 1999 therefore the high turbidity present in lake xochimilco could reduce the ability of the larval a mexicanum to acquire food resources turbid water influences the visual and non visual senses of a mexicanum and o niloticus however we observed a higher preference for prey by o niloticus fig 3 as compared to a mexicanum fig 2 turbidity can affect the behaviour of prey and predators granqvist and mattila 2004 for example turbidity can protect prey species from predators turbidity reduces the intensity of light thus preventing the selection of prey by predators thereby providing a refuge wissel et al 2003 as previously described by wissel et al 2003 the results of our experiments also showed decreased prey consumption in the test jars with 32 3 ntu turbidity this level of turbidity is common in the natural habitat of a mexicanum and the introduced species o niloticus figs 4 and 5 our study showed the ontogenic changes in prey consumption of a mexicanum and tilapia both the predators selected smaller prey such as alona glabra during the first weeks but could also feed on h incongruens subsequently they fed on larger cladocerans such as macrothrix triserialis and moina macrocopa ending with simocephalus vetulus it appears that in clear water the habitat of the prey rather than its size influences selectivity by these predators however the turbid medium altered this pattern especially where a mexicanum consumed mainly smaller and slow moving benthic prey mainly for small species with slow movements and benthic habits such as a glabra and heterocypris incongruens also a mexicanum was unable to consume large sized prey in turbid media even in the final weeks of the study while such trends were not evident in tilapia which consumed prey with the same rate in turbid as well as in clear medium similar trends have been reported for the fish xenotoca variata where the prey consumption in turbid medium decreased by 75 as compared to clear water manjarrez et al 2015 prey capture by aquatic predators depends on contrast and this in turn varies with factors such as the prey size the level of ambient light and turbidity figueiredo et al 2015 zaret 1980 concluded higher fish predation efficiency on bosmina with a big dark eye in lake gatun panama due to priority of the visual effect here we used prey that varied in size and in movement but the morphological structures contrasting them with the medium were weaker therefore the differences in the prey consumption by the amphibians and the fish in this study was possibly related to the acuity of vision the increase of light intensity has a positive effect upon the visual range of aquatic predators until a certain saturation level denoël et al 2016 delcourt et al 2013 found that larval damselfish showed a reduction in feeding under conditions of low light we found similar trends in the amphibian but not in tilapia which perhaps contributes to its success in turbid waters around the world in both clear and turbid water the fish consumed about 17 5 and 2 5 respectively more prey a 2 5 greater consumption by the fish than the axolotl may be low in a short term study but is considerable when extrapolated to field conditions and the two orders of magnitude difference in the density of tilapia as compared to axolotl in lake xochimilco our study also shows that the prey acuity of a mexicanum is half that of tilapia in both turbid and clear waters the decrease in prey visibility in turbid waters as compared to clear waters was by 43 in larval a mexicanum and 39 in tilapia the adverse effect of back scatter which is more in turbid media has been shown in planktivorous fish fed daphnia spp vinyard and o brien 1976 as well as piscivorous and trout salvelinus namaycush vogel and beauchamp 1999 the visual acuity of fish is superior to that of amphibians mohun and wilkinson 2015 the size of the lens in fish is positively associated with its standard length dobberfuhl et al 2005 fellows 2015 and the visual acuity sharply increases with growth especially during larval and juvenile stages van poorten and walters 2015 our results also show that the reactive distance of tilapia was greater 15 cm than that of the axolotl 8 cm and the longer reactive distance was associated with turbidity more so for the larval amphibian than for fish in nature these differences along with changes in habitat dobberfuhl et al 2005 eventually lead to a competitive pressure on the axolotl several factors reduce the feeding efficiency of axolotls as compared to fish these include the development of limbs thompson et al 2014 poor vision alcaraz et al 2015 and slow swimming rate chaparro herrera et al 2011 sensitivity to toxicants in natural waterbodies can affect the perception of prey especially since these amphbians depend on mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors on their skin kerby et al 2010 the movement of the prey is another factor influencing prey detection barnes and mingolla 2012 this factor is of less importance here because we have not used very fast moving prey such as copepods as the size of the prey increases the stimulus on the retina of the predator also increases thereby decreasing the contrast threshold and an increase in the reaction distance eggers 1977 we found that there is a distinct ontogenic shift in prey preference by the axolotl newly born larvae prefer slow moving small prey while with an increase in age the axolotls prefer larger sized cladocerans which probably provide a greater stimulus for capture freshwater bodies regularly contain high amounts of different types of suspended material that rapidly attenuates to light and changes the spectral range of the available light sato and shichida 2014 experiments show the presence of uv photoreceptors on the ambystomid s retina e g ambystoma tigrinum perry and mcnaughton 1991 found an increase in

1088,benthic diatom assemblages on the natural substrata at balikhli river northwest iran were investigated monthly a total of 96 samples were collected from epilithic and epipelic substrata a total of 110 taxa from 49 genera were identified the most abundant diatom species were cyclotella meneghiniana diatoma moniliformis nitzschia inconspicua planothidium lanceolatum and gomphonema olivaceum non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analyses revealed explicit differences between diatom communities of stony and sediment substrates although common diatom taxa were not restricted to single substrates some taxa had higher tendencies to every substrate the nmds analysis also showed differences between summer and autumn samples canonical correspondence analysis cca of groups resulted from cluster analysis showed that the nutrient concentration gradient ph were the most important factors affecting the composition of diatom assemblages and species distribution in our study orthophosphates had greater effect than nitrates and gomphonem parvulum and navicula recenswere found in phosphate rich samples anthropogenic input including agricultural and domestic wastes may be responsible for high levels of these parameters alkali volcanic rocks and limestone sediments underlying the watershed could explain the high ph in the balikhli river in total 67 5 of the identified species in the river are considered as alkaliphilous the findings of this study denote that the main determinants of variation in benthic diatom communities of balikhli river result from a combination of land use patterns caused by human activities river hydrology and natural phenomena including geology keywords epilithon epipelon seasonal variation simper analysis ardabil province 1 introduction rivers lakes and wetlands are threatened by a wide range of human activities such as agricultural industrial and domestic runoff land use recreation and there is growing concern about the global impacts to freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem health dudgeon et al 2006 vörösmarty et al 2010 this has led to the development and refinement of methods and tools for water quality monitoring beyond those based only on physical and chemical properties including biological indicators kelly and whitton 1998 bunn et al 2010 diatoms are a large and diverse group of single celled algae they are distributed throughout the world in nearly all types of aquatic systems and are one of the most important food resources in marine and freshwater ecosystems periphytic diatoms are widely used for the biological assessment of running waters due to their sensitivity wide distribution and relative ease of identification they quickly respond to changes of environmental variables thus reflecting

parameters have been carried out in iran very rarely masoudian et al 2009 imanpour namin et al 2013 sharifinia et al 2016 therefore the main aim of this study was to determine species composition of diatom assemblages from balikhli river nw iran to investigate the relationships between diatom diversity and environmental factors and to find which ecological factors explain most of the variation 2 materials and methods balikhli river is a permanent river in ardabil province it originates from bozgoosh and sabalan elevations in northwest iran the yamchi dam was constructed 2003 on the balikhli river about 25km to the southwest of ardabil city several important tributaries including borjlou river saghghezchi river aghlaghan river jurab river flow in to the balikhli river and increase its water volume a large amount of development and other human generated disturbance occurs throughout the watershed which contributes substantially to nutrient loads and organic pollution six sampling sites were selected along balikhli river three sites were located upstream and three downstream of the yamchi dam fig 1 detailed characteristics of the sites are shown in table 1 to investigate the diatom assemblages samples of epilithic and epipelic algae were collected samples were collected monthly from october 2013 through september 2014 extremely harsh weather conditions prevented monthly sampling during the winter months epilithic diatoms were collected from five random stones at each site stone surfaces were scrubbed using a toothbrush kelly et al 1998 epipelic diatoms were collected using an inverted petri dish along the riverbed to collect the surface sediments fitzpatrick et al 1998 in total 96 samples were collected samples were preserved by adding 4 formalin diatom frustules were cleaned with hot nitric acid the acid cleaned samples were then washed and rinsed by distilled water permanent diatom slides were mounted with naphrax for each sample three slides were prepared diatoms were identified under a light microscope olympus dp12 1000 magnification to species level according to krammer and lange bertalot 1986 1988 1991a b and spaulding et al 2010 and a minimum of 400 valves were counted per slide relative abundance of each observed taxa was calculated during sampling the water temperature ph do ec tds and salinity were measured in situ using a portable hach g500 multimeter water samples were collected from each location to measure the concentrations of silicate sio2 mgl 1 nitrate no3 mgl 1 orthophosphate po4 3 mgl 1 ammonium nh4 mgl 1 and sulfate so4 2 mgl 1 in the laboratory following american public health association procedures clescerl et al 1999 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analyses were performed to visualize relationships between diatom communities from different samples substrates seasons and sites rare species 1 were removed all data transformed by square root and a distance matrix was calculated based on a bray curtis similarity matrix with all samples using primer 6 clarke and gorley 2006 statistical differences between diatom communities of different seasons sampling stations and substrates were tested separately by permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova primer 6 clarke and gorley 2006 in addition simper analysis square root bray curtis similarity primer 6 was used to determine the most representative taxa those contributing the most to the dissimilarity within groups of the statistically different groups of seasons stations and substrates clarke and gorley 2006 the cluster analysis bray curtis similarity matrix primer 6 clarke and gorley 2006 was used to identify samples with similar diatom composition to explore relationships between diatom assemblages and water quality dataset

water temperatures were measured at s2 and s6 in early summer ph ranged between 6 2 and 8 8 the high concentrations of conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds orthophosphate po4 3 bod and cod were observed in s2 in mid and late summer due to the waste material loads from thermal mineralized water spring and borjlou village high concentrations of silicate and nitrate were measured in s3 during summer months and sulfate was high in s6 during study period considerable variation was also observed for sulfate from 112 32mgl 1 to 404 64mgl 1 at s5 3 2 diatom assemblages a total of 110 taxa from 49 genera were identified some were presented in panahy mirzahasnlou et al 2018 from this 50 taxa were common in two substrates thirty seven taxa from 22 genera were observed only in epipelic samples eleven taxa from 8 genera were exclusive to epilithic samples most of the different taxa in two substrates were rare species and were eliminated from the data analysis the most species rich genera were nitzschia 18 followed by navicula 9 and gomphonema 8 from 110 taxa only 46 taxa were not considered rare species occurring with greater than 1 relative abundance at three or more samples and were included in analyses table 3 the non metric multidimensional scaling nmds ordination based on square root transformed abundances and bray curtis similarity matrix showed no clear grouping between samples for this reason the plot was not included in the results different nmds plots were drawn for samples of different substrates seasons and stations non metric multidimensional scaling nmds of different substrates revealed an incomplete separation between epilithic and epipelic samples fig 2 results of a permanova test showed these differences were statistically significant df 1 pseudo f 11 694 p 0 001 indicating that the structure of diatom assemblages differs with substrate simper test revealed a dissimilarity of 57 09 between epilithic and epipelic samples the species that contributed most to the dissimilarity between two substrate groups were nitzschia inconspicua and amphora pediculus with greater mean abundance in epilithic samples and planothidium lanceolatum diatoma moniliformis and cyclotella memeghiniana with greater mean abundance in epipelic samples the nmds plot of the season groups revealed moderate separation between summer and autumn samples however spring samples substantially overlapped with other two sample groups fig 3 permanova test with pair wise comparisons revealed statistically significant differences between summer autumn spring summer

with high average abundance in autumn months nmds plot for different stations revealed the relationship between different stations all together fig 4 permanova analysis was conducted on all station groups separate pairwise comparisons between groups were also conducted the results showed that the differences between stations are statistically significant table 4 cluster analysis identified three major groups based on diatom assemblages fig 5 some samples were eliminated since they were not included in any groups or consisted of small groups less than 5 samples different ccas were performed for major groups of cluster analysis and with total samples altogether only species with relative abundance 5 in two samples or 10 at one sample were included in analysis the taxa environmental factors relationship analysis cca of group i revealed that the first axis was strongly negatively correlated with silicate and temperature while the second axis had strong negative correlation with sulfate and positive correlation with phosphate s brebissonii and odonthidium mesodon were negatively correlated with temperature which indicated that they found at low temperatures autumn months stephanodiscus neoastraea was associated with sulfate gomphonema parvulum and navicula recens were affected by orthophosphate while navicula gregaria n reichardtiana and d moniliformis occurred in the next direction and were found at low orthophosphate concentrations fig 6 the cca diagram of group ii showed that the first axis was positively correlated with ph and to some extent ammonium the second axis had positive correlation with nitrate silicate phosphate and strong negative correlation with cod bod and sulfate it also showed that nitrate has strong positive correlation with silicate and orthophosphate cod has positive correlation with sulfate the results of the cca showed that the abundance of p lanceolatum was related to nitrate orthophosphate and silicate nitzschia fonticula was related to nitrate level though was observed in samples taken at low sulfate and cod concentrations nitzschia dissipata n trivialis gomphonema olivaceum a pediculus rhoicosphenia abbreviata and s brebissonii was related to ph while psammothidium subatomoides and cocconeis pediculus were in the next direction n gregaria was associated with ammonium while nitzschia liebetruthii and cocconeis placentula negatively correlated with this factor fig 6 in cca diagram of group iii the most important factors was ph which negatively correlated with axis2 orthophosphate partially nitrate silicate bod and ec which correlated with axis 1 fig 6 orthophosphate had strong positive correlation with nitrate and silicate factors bod ec cod and ammonium were correlated the diagram showed that n recens p lanceolatum and encyonema silesiaca were correlated with nitrate and silicate levels n gregaria and o mesodon negatively correlated with orthophosphate cocconeis placentula navicula erifuga n reichardtiana and n liebetruthii were affected by oxygen level 4 discussion rivers provide various services to the riparian population drinking water and water for domestic purposes are obtained from rivers and streams however the river ecosystems are increasingly exposed to environmental stressors there is a large amount of development and other human generated disturbance that occurs throughout the watershed which substantially contributes to nutrients and organic pollution to begin with agricultural activities increase inputs of nutrients and sediments harding et al 1999 leland and porter 2000 residential and commercial estates contribute large quantities of organic wastewater and solids lobo et al 1995 industries are sources of inorganic and thermal pollution izsak et al 2002 benthic diatoms function as an important component of sustaining aquatic ecosystems health many studies have reported that the composition and structure of benthic diatom are affected by various chemical and physical environmental variables carpenter and waite 2000 soininen 2002 leira and sabater 2005 ndiritu et al 2006 urrea and sabater 2009 it has been shown that at smaller spatial scales substratum type and habitat heterogeneity are related to species composition leland 1995 diatom species often show marked preferences for particular substrate and microniches or microhabitats epilithic epipelic epipsammic epiphytic cox 1988 rothfritz et al 1997 our nmds analysis showed significant differences between diatom communities of two types of substrates epilithic vs epipelic however as shown in other studies potapova and charles 2005 bere and tundisi 2011 common diatom taxa were not restricted to single substrate among dissimilar taxa 37 taxa 33 63 of identified taxa from 22 genera were encountered only in epipelic samples while 11 taxa 10 from 8 genera were exclusive to epilithic samples most taxa were too rare to be included in the nmds analysis however between similar species of two substrates n inconspicua a pediculus r abbreviata n liebetruthii had higher tendencies to epilithic substrates p lanceolatum d moniliformis c meneghiniana g olivaceum n trivialis s neoastraea s brebissonii nitzschia palea and navicula capitatoradiata were common on epipelic substrates potapova and charles 2005 reported that a pediculus r abbreviata displayed a preference for hard substrates because they tend to attach by stalks or mucilage c meneghiniana is a planktonic taxon and its presence in abundance in benthic communities of the river is interesting in our study this taxon was most abundant in epipelic samples specially in site 2 this site was located downstream of the hot mineral water springs in general there are many springs throughout the watershed though the presence of this centric species maybe due to the turbulence in river noga et al 2013 also reported c meneghiniana as one of the most frequent species from benthic diatom communities of wisłok river diatom assemblages in our study generally did not express regular seasonal succession but there were differences in diatom assemblages in different seasons possibly in response to water temperature some of this variation also may be related to nutrient availability elias et al 2012 showed that in small shallow lowland streams diatom communities reacted to temperature which might resulted from the fact that the two water bodies they studied were small and riparian vegetation was practically nonexistent hence they are more exposed to sunlight and water temperature variation was strongly influenced by the atmospheric temperature poole and berman 2001 our study showed that n inconspicua p lanceolatum a pediculus and c meneghiniana were more abundant in summer while in elias et al 2012 p lanceolatum was considered as less sensitive to temperature variation and was dominant all year round in our study a pediculus was more abundant in warmer seasons shibazaki et al 2013 recorded that sessile diatoms such as p lanceolatum also were abundant in summer unlike our study a pediculus was very abundant all seasons while n inconspicua only in autumn winter seasons in sabater 1990 these differences may reflect the fact that factors affecting the composition and distribution of benthic diatoms are complex sabater 1990 attributed the seasonal variations to changes in water salinity and chloride concentration along the year rather than to temperature variation in our study s brebissonii was more abundant in autumn this is in accordance with results of the cca analysis which shows this species has negative correlation with temperature anderson 2000 declared that indirect meteorological effects on algal productivity via control of nutrient inputs are probably of greater importance than direct influence of temperature nutrient level and ph play important role in structuring benthic diatom communities in this study water temperature bod cod and ec were in the next order orthophosphate and nitrate are trophic level parameters berthon et al 2011 most of the abundant and common taxa in the river were characteristic of eutrophic ecosystems van dam et al 1994 in our study orthophosphates had greater effect than nitrates anthropogenic input including agricultural and domestic wastes may be responsible for high levels of these parameters gomphonem parvulum and n recens were found in phosphate rich samples in our study g parvulum has also been found in rivers with high concentrations of nitrates and phosphates near agricultural land in the u s japan poland and germany lobo et al 1995 leland and porter 2000 köster and hübener 2001 sczepocka and szulc 2006 zampella et al 2007 high concentrations of sulfate might be due to sulfated mineral hot water springs and anthropogenic activities in the region potapova and charles 2003 reported high variation in diatom assemblages associated with increased sulfate concentrations which they attributed to a combined response of diatoms to the concentration of sulfate ph and total mineral content the ph has a major effect on the composition of diatom assemblages verb and vis 2000 smucker and vis 2011 the affinity of alkalinity with species a pediculus g olivaceum n dissipata r abbreviata and s brebissonii has already been confirmed by autecology and the species have been categorized as alkaliphilous van dam et al 1994 moreover 67 5 of the identified species in the river are considered as alkaliphilous according to van dam categorization the ph is regulated by alkaline metals and it may be related to geological conditions and local agricultural activities alkali volcanic rocks and limestone sediments underlying the watershed could explain the high ph in the balikhli river silica is often a major limiting nutrient for diatom growth as it is essential for the siliceous structures in diatom valves martin jézéquel et al 2000 bod and cod are organic pollution parameters and indicative of human impacts 5 conclusion factors that affect the composition and distribution of benthic diatoms are complex and include geological hydrological climatic physiochemical and biological factors our results indicated that sulfate orthophosphate nitrate ph temperature and silicate were the main variables with significant influences on composition of diatom assemblages in the river other factors such as bod cod ec and ammonium concentrations also influenced benthic diatom community composition diatom composition was diverse at every investigated site each site accommodated specific diatom assemblage corresponding to the various influencing factors as is often the case in multivariate analysis of species data a large part of the variation in cca analysis remained unexplained such uncertainty is probably associated with other factors such as river hydrology another factor maybe the presence of many species with broad tolerances for the environmental gradient as most of the collected species were cosmopolitan taxa sabater 2000 gold et al 2003b gomez and licursi 2003 duong et al 2006 therefore the main determinants of variation of benthic diatom communities may result from a combination of change in land use patterns by man natural phenomena including geology and climatic changes and river hydrology conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was

1088,benthic diatom assemblages on the natural substrata at balikhli river northwest iran were investigated monthly a total of 96 samples were collected from epilithic and epipelic substrata a total of 110 taxa from 49 genera were identified the most abundant diatom species were cyclotella meneghiniana diatoma moniliformis nitzschia inconspicua planothidium lanceolatum and gomphonema olivaceum non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analyses revealed explicit differences between diatom communities of stony and sediment substrates although common diatom taxa were not restricted to single substrates some taxa had higher tendencies to every substrate the nmds analysis also showed differences between summer and autumn samples canonical correspondence analysis cca of groups resulted from cluster analysis showed that the nutrient concentration gradient ph were the most important factors affecting the composition of diatom assemblages and species distribution in our study orthophosphates had greater effect than nitrates and gomphonem parvulum and navicula recenswere found in phosphate rich samples anthropogenic input including agricultural and domestic wastes may be responsible for high levels of these parameters alkali volcanic rocks and limestone sediments underlying the watershed could explain the high ph in the balikhli river in total 67 5 of the identified species in the river are considered as alkaliphilous the findings of this study denote that the main determinants of variation in benthic diatom communities of balikhli river result from a combination of land use patterns caused by human activities river hydrology and natural phenomena including geology keywords epilithon epipelon seasonal variation simper analysis ardabil province 1 introduction rivers lakes and wetlands are threatened by a wide range of human activities such as agricultural industrial and domestic runoff land use recreation and there is growing concern about the global impacts to freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem health dudgeon et al 2006 vörösmarty et al 2010 this has led to the development and refinement of methods and tools for water quality monitoring beyond those based only on physical and chemical properties including biological indicators kelly and whitton 1998 bunn et al 2010 diatoms are a large and diverse group of single celled algae they are distributed throughout the world in nearly all types of aquatic systems and are one of the most important food resources in marine and freshwater ecosystems periphytic diatoms are widely used for the biological assessment of running waters due to their sensitivity wide distribution and relative ease of identification they quickly respond to changes of environmental variables thus reflecting overall ecological quality and effects of different stressors bona et al 2007 their composition and distribution may be influenced by a number of factors such as geological hydrological climatic physicochemical and biological factors including nutrient concentration cardinale 2011 organic contamination kwandrans et al 1998 electrical conductivity leira and sabater 2005 rimet 2009 ph charles

communities might be influenced by different substrata present at a single site understanding the relationship between environmental factors and diatom communities distribution is important in developing diatom based water quality indices potapova and charles 2002 and can be useful tool in detecting anthropogenic impacts too ács et al 2004 diatoms have received little attention in iran limited papers on diatom flora wasylik 1975 moghadam 1976 nejadsattari 2005 panahy mirzahasanlou et al 2018 kheiri et al 2019 studies on river diatom communities and their relationship with water parameters have been carried out in iran very rarely masoudian et al 2009 imanpour namin et al 2013 sharifinia et al 2016 therefore the main aim of this study was to determine species composition of diatom assemblages from balikhli river nw iran to investigate the relationships between diatom diversity and environmental factors and to find which ecological factors explain most of the variation 2 materials and methods balikhli river is a permanent river in ardabil province it originates from bozgoosh and sabalan elevations in northwest iran the yamchi dam was constructed 2003 on the balikhli river about 25km to the southwest of ardabil city several important tributaries including borjlou river saghghezchi river aghlaghan river jurab river flow in to the balikhli river and increase its water volume a large amount of development and other human generated disturbance occurs throughout the watershed which contributes substantially to nutrient loads and organic pollution six sampling sites were selected along balikhli river three sites were located upstream and three downstream of the yamchi dam fig 1 detailed characteristics of the sites are shown in table 1 to investigate the diatom assemblages samples of epilithic and epipelic algae were collected samples were collected monthly from october 2013 through september 2014 extremely harsh weather conditions prevented monthly sampling during the winter months epilithic diatoms were collected from five random stones at each site stone surfaces were scrubbed using a toothbrush kelly et al 1998 epipelic diatoms were collected using an inverted petri dish along the riverbed to collect the surface sediments fitzpatrick et al 1998 in total 96 samples were collected samples were preserved by adding 4 formalin diatom frustules were cleaned with hot nitric acid the acid cleaned samples were then washed and rinsed by distilled water permanent diatom slides were mounted with naphrax for each sample three slides were prepared diatoms were identified under a light microscope olympus dp12 1000 magnification to species level according to krammer and lange bertalot 1986 1988 1991a b and spaulding et al 2010 and a minimum of 400 valves were counted per slide relative abundance of each observed taxa was calculated during sampling the water temperature ph do ec tds and salinity were measured in situ using a portable hach g500 multimeter water samples were collected from each location to measure the concentrations of silicate sio2 mgl 1 nitrate no3 mgl 1 orthophosphate po4 3 mgl 1 ammonium nh4 mgl 1 and sulfate so4 2 mgl 1 in the laboratory following american public health association procedures clescerl et al 1999 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analyses were performed to visualize relationships between diatom communities from different samples substrates seasons and sites rare species 1 were removed all data transformed by square root and a distance matrix was calculated based on a bray curtis similarity matrix with all samples using primer 6 clarke and gorley 2006 statistical differences between diatom communities of different seasons sampling stations and substrates were tested separately by permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova primer 6 clarke and gorley 2006 in addition simper analysis square root bray curtis similarity primer 6 was used to determine the most representative taxa those contributing the most to the dissimilarity within groups of the statistically different groups of seasons stations and substrates clarke and gorley 2006 the cluster analysis bray curtis similarity matrix primer 6 clarke and gorley 2006 was used to identify samples with similar diatom composition to explore relationships between diatom assemblages and water quality dataset including taxa relative abundance data and environmental data imported to canoco 5 ter braak and smilauer 2013 canonical correspondence analysis cca was used to determine the factors which influence the structure of assemblages all water quality variables listed in table 1 were included in ccas separate ccas were performed for groups from cluster analysis classification 3 results 3 1 the physical and chemical characteristics of the river the values of physical and chemical variables measured in the study period are shown in table 2 water temperature varied between 4 9 c and 25 7 c maximum water temperatures were measured at s2 and s6 in early summer ph ranged between 6 2 and 8 8 the high concentrations of conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds orthophosphate po4 3 bod and cod were observed in s2 in mid and late summer due to the waste material loads from thermal mineralized water spring and borjlou village high concentrations of silicate and nitrate were measured in s3 during summer months and sulfate was high in s6 during study period considerable variation was also observed for sulfate from 112 32mgl 1 to 404 64mgl 1 at s5 3 2 diatom assemblages a total of 110 taxa from 49 genera were identified some were presented in panahy mirzahasnlou et al 2018 from this 50 taxa were common in two substrates thirty seven taxa from 22 genera were observed only in epipelic samples eleven taxa from 8 genera were exclusive to epilithic samples most of the different taxa in two substrates were rare species and were eliminated from the data analysis the most species rich genera were nitzschia 18 followed by navicula 9 and gomphonema 8 from 110 taxa only 46 taxa were not considered rare species occurring with greater than 1 relative abundance at three or more samples and were included in analyses table 3 the non metric multidimensional scaling nmds ordination based on square root transformed abundances and bray curtis similarity matrix showed no clear grouping between samples for this reason the plot was not included in the results different nmds plots were drawn for samples of different substrates seasons and stations non metric multidimensional scaling nmds of different substrates revealed an incomplete separation between epilithic and epipelic samples fig 2 results of a permanova test showed these differences were statistically significant df 1 pseudo f 11 694 p 0 001 indicating that the structure of diatom assemblages differs with substrate simper test revealed a dissimilarity of 57 09 between epilithic and epipelic samples the species that contributed most to the dissimilarity between two substrate groups were nitzschia inconspicua and amphora pediculus with greater mean abundance in epilithic samples and planothidium lanceolatum diatoma moniliformis and cyclotella memeghiniana with greater mean abundance in epipelic samples the nmds plot of the season groups revealed moderate separation between summer and autumn samples however spring samples substantially overlapped with other two sample groups fig 3 permanova test with pair wise comparisons revealed statistically significant differences between summer autumn spring summer

with high average abundance in autumn months nmds plot for different stations revealed the relationship between different stations all together fig 4 permanova analysis was conducted on all station groups separate pairwise comparisons between groups were also conducted the results showed that the differences between stations are statistically significant table 4 cluster analysis identified three major groups based on diatom assemblages fig 5 some samples were eliminated since they were not included in any groups or consisted of small groups less than 5 samples different ccas were performed for major groups of cluster analysis and with total samples altogether only species with relative abundance 5 in two samples or 10 at one sample were included in analysis the taxa environmental

next direction and were found at low orthophosphate concentrations fig 6 the cca diagram of group ii showed that the first axis was positively correlated with ph and to some extent ammonium the second axis had positive correlation with nitrate silicate phosphate and strong negative correlation with cod bod and sulfate it also showed that nitrate has strong positive correlation with silicate and orthophosphate cod has positive correlation with sulfate the results of the cca showed that the abundance of p lanceolatum was related to nitrate orthophosphate and silicate nitzschia fonticula was related to nitrate level though was observed in samples taken at low sulfate and cod concentrations nitzschia dissipata n trivialis gomphonema olivaceum a pediculus rhoicosphenia abbreviata and s

1089,spatial distribution of plant communities in the human modified aquatic ecosystem within the dnieper bug estuary is marked by discrete continuous patterns continuity is caused by hydrological interconnection between the subsystems and discreteness by habitat diversity for higher aquatic plants the continuity aspect consists in overgrowth of emergent plants all round the shoreline in both subsystems the discreteness aspect is noticed in presence of floating leaf plants and submerged plants belts in the natural subsystem only the lake and their absence in the artificial one the sand quarry for algal communities continuity is observed in predominance of the same divisions in both subsystems discreteness manifests itself in higher taxonomic and floristic diversity of algae in the natural subsystem than in the artificial one the process of hydrological interaction between phytoplankton and epiphytic algae is another important mechanism sustaining continuity of algal communities keywords dnieper bug estuary water bodies phytoplankton higher aquatic plants epiphytic algal communities taxonomic diversity 1 introduction estuaries are unique aquatic ecosystems inhabited by freshwater and marine organisms and distinguished by high productivity and life concentration odum 1953 wolanski 2013 these are dynamic ecosystems with perpetual fluctuations of physical chemical and biological parameters paturej 2006 lobry et al 2008 nyitrai et al 2012 estuaries exhibit high structural and functional biodiversity ahel et al 1996 meire et al 2005 and act as ecological gateways for alien aquatic species migration gruszka 1999 these aquatic ecosystems are very important from economic and recreational points of view therefore it is essential to assess environmental risks for estuarine ecosystems in order to integrate ecological management with sustainable economy kowalewska kalkowska and kowalewski 2004 today serious ecological risks are associated with hydrotechnical works on sand recovery and bottom dredging for navigation purposes hydrotechnical operations cause fragmentation or loss of aquatic and wetland habitats waltham and connolly 2007 and can reduce aquatic biodiversity mohamamad and jalal 2018 this type of human impact often transforms estuaries and creates new natural artificial water bodies within them sand extraction is among key factors affecting the dnieper bug estuary for instance a large artificial quarry was dug near kardashynskyi liman lake in the early 2000s after the quarry had connected with the natural lake a new type of aquatic ecosystem emerged within the dnieper bug estuary a human modified one at present this human modified ecosystem consists of two interconnected subsystems a natural one the lake itself and an artificial one the newly created sand quarry in order to develop scientific rationale for protection conservation and sustainable use of unique estuary ecosystems it is necessary to assess their biodiversity this is particularly important for plant communities diversity because they compose the primary link of energy flow and regulate the water quality it is known manoylov et al 2016 that serious environmental risks such as hypoxia fish mortality are often preceded by changes in the primary producers species composition therefore data on autotrophic communities diversity in estuarine ecosystems can become a scientific background for preventing large scale hazards to their functioning one should note that publications on biodiversity in interconnected natural artificial ecosystems within estuaries are quite scarce waltham and connolly 2007 2013 as regards kardashynskyi liman lake the most recent published data relate to its natural subsystem only and were obtained during 2003 2013 ovechko et al 2015 however the ecological situation in the lake has changed for the past five years among other things it is explained by reduction of water volume flowing via the north crimean canal and respectively by increase in the water releases through the kakhovka hydropower plant dam to the dnieper bug estuary in the view of the above it is required to obtain the latest data on the diversity of autotrophic communities in the subsystems of kardashynskyi liman lake this paper deals with the results of field studies carried out in summer 2017 given the fact that this natural artificial subsystem is very interesting from hydrological and hydrobiological viewpoints there is an urgent necessity to continue these preliminary studies therefore in the years to come we will explore seasonal and long term dynamics of plant communities and the main abiotic factors making effect upon them including water salinity and nutrient content we will also consider present day climate change primarily the increase in the dnieper water temperature in accordance with the abiotic biotic regulatory concept zalewski and naiman 1985 aquatic communities structure and functioning in riverine ecosystems are driven by hierarchy of abiotic and biotic factors only when abiotic factors become stable and predictable biotic interactions start to manifest themselves since the abiotic biotic regulatory concept can be extrapolated to other types of freshwater ecosystems zalewski 2015 we will apply this concept to our research object the autotrophic communities diversity in the natural and artificial water bodies will be considered in close connection with abiotic factors the aim of this research is to analyze the taxonomic diversity of higher aquatic plants phytoplankton epiphytic algae and to reveal some abiotic factors making effect upon continuity and discreteness of autotrophic communities in two interconnected subsystems natural and artificial within the dnieper bug estuary 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the ecosystem under study is a part of the dnieper bug estuary it is located on the left bank floodplain of the dnieper delta in kherson region of ukraine the ecosystem consists of two hydrologically connected subsystems the natural kardashynskyi liman lake and the artificially created sand quarry fig 1 2 2 sampling procedure and laboratory processing of samples field studies of plant communities in kardashynskyi liman lake and the sand quarry were conducted in summer 2017 in order to assess higher aquatic plants diversity route surveys were carried out in the lake and the sand quarry water areas with botanical specimens being taken phytoplankton and epiphytic algae sampling was performed at six observation sites fig 1 simultaneously with algae sampling water temperature and secchi disk transparency were measured water samples were taken for measuring the oxygen concentration in both subsystems and salinity in the natural lake subsystem 1 dm3 water samples for phytoplankton study were taken with the help of a ruthner s bathometer preserved with 40 formalin solution in the ratio of 1 100 concentrated by sedimentation method and processed in the laboratory according to shcherbak 2006 and shcherbak and zadorozhnaya 2013 the epiphytic algae were sampled in the following way plant fragments 5 8 cm long were carefully cut down under water put into wide necked 100 cm3 jars and covered with distilled water back in the laboratory algae were removed from the plant fragments with a brush and preserved by adding 5 ml of 40 formalin solution into the jar semenyuk and shcherbak 2016 species similarity of planktonic and epiphytic algal communities was assessed with the sørensen similarity index sørensen 1948 habitat association of algae was analyzed according to barinova et al 2006 salinity preferences in accordance with classifications set forth in algaebase guiry and guiry 2019 barinova et al 2006 and van dam et al 1994 3 results and discussion 3 1 abiotic factors according to our field survey results and literature data zhukinskiy et al 1989 ovechko et al 2015 korzhov 2016 the lake and the sand quarry are considerably different in abiotic factors hydromorphological hydrophysical and hydrochemical table 1 3 1 1 hydromorphological parameters hydromorphological parameters of the water bodies under study differ significantly the lake subsystem is shallow and the sand quarry subsystem is considerably deeper table 1 the lake is twice as large as the sand quarry in area however the water volume in the sand quarry is about 25 larger than in the lake the lake is hydrologically connected with the lower dnieper and exchanges water with it mainly via the chaika channel to a lesser extent via the chaika river and several smaller channels water exchange of the sand quarry is fulfilled via the channel which connects the quarry with kardashynskyi liman lake complete replacement of all water volume in the sand quarry is almost 1 5 times slower than in the lake ovechko et al 2015 korzhov 2016 it is because water volume in the sand quarry is larger than in the lake moreover the sand quarry has only one source of water exchange one channel and the lake several sources several channels fig 1 table 1 3 1 2 hydrophysical parameters hydromorphological dissimilarities between the lake and the sand quarry bring about differences in their temperature conditions the lake is almost homothermal the divergence between the subsurface and near bottom temperatures does not exceed 0 9 c the sand quarry demonstrates temperature stratification in summer with the divergence between the temperature in the subsurface and near bottom layers reaching 2 8 c there was no noticeable difference in secchi disk transparency between the lake and the sand quarry however due to greater depths the sand quarry has lower relative thickness of photic layer in respect of the depth than the lake table 1 3 1 3 hydrochemical parameters significant differences are observed in oxygen conditions between the subsystems under study the dissolved oxygen content in the lake is more than twice as high as in the sand quarry table 1 the oxygen saturation in the lake is far above 100 which is indicative of active photosynthetic aeration at the same time the sand quarry s oxygen saturation is below 100 the maximum oxygen concentrations both in the lake and in the sand quarry were observed near the sources of water exchange the highest oxygen content in the lake 15 91 mg o2 dm 3 was registered at site 3 nearest to the chaika channel through which the lake is filled with water ovechko et al 2015 the highest oxygen concentration in the sand quarry 6 80 mg o2 dm 3 was observed at site 4 nearest to the channel connecting the quarry with the lake so water exchange makes a positive effect upon oxygen conditions in kardashynskyi liman lake it is explained by influx of oxygen saturated water masses from the lower dnieper besides water flow creates favorable conditions for autotrophic organisms photosynthesis mass et al 2010 similar results were obtained for floodplain lakes of the vistula river the oxygen content in lakes hydrologically connected with the river was much higher than in isolated lakes dembowska and napiórkowski 2015 water salinity in the lake subsystem fluctuated within 0 70 1 24 g dm 3 at different observation sites in accordance with the venice system international symposium for the classification of brackish waters 1958 the lake water is oligohaline according to ovechko et al 2015 the ammonium nitrogen concentration in the lake in summer season makes up 0 28 0 45 mg n dm 3 and inorganic phosphorus concentration 0 032 0 145 mg p dm 3 therefore the lake is eutrophic we have not found any data on the sand quarry s salinity and nutrients concentration in the available literature so it is necessary to study these important abiotic factors in the future on the whole each of the water bodies under study is marked by a distinctive complex of abiotic factors which make effect upon autotrophic communities 3 2 autotrophic communities plant communities higher aquatic plants phytoplankton epiphytic algae are distributed in kardashynskyi liman lake and the sand quarry according to discrete continuous patterns 3 2 1 higher aquatic plants higher aquatic plants communities are represented by 12 species the continuum in their spatial distribution can be described as follows both subsystems have a distinct belt of emergent plants all round the shoreline this belt is dominated by phragmites australis cav trin ex steud and typha angustifolia l besides scirpus lacustris l and juncus conglomeratus l j ieersi marss are observed but in lower quantities signs of local discreteness can be seen further off shore of the emergent plants belt in the lake there is a belt of floating leaf plants hydrocharis morsus ranae l nymphaea alba l nuphar lutea l smith it is followed by a belt of submerged plants myriophyllum spicatum l ceratophyllum demersum l stratiotes aloides l potamogeton crispus l vallisneria spiralis l unlike the lake the sand quarry does not have any distinct belts of floating leaf and submerged vegetation such discrete pattern is explained by morphometry and light conditions of the water bodies under study the lake is mainly shallow and photic layer occupies almost the whole water column table 1 the sand quarry has significant depths and the depth increases abruptly from the shoreline moreover the photic layer thickness is about 50 of the water body s depth our observation results are confirmed by the data from literature it is known that submerged plants can spread only to certain depth limit below which the solar radiation availability becomes too low for them to photosynthesize vestergaard and sand jensen 2000 zingel et al 2006 rosińska and gołdyn 2015 phillips et al 2016 such depth limit is highly correlated with water clarity 3 2 2 phytoplankton phytoplankton of the natural artificial water ecosystem under study was represented by 88 species and infraspecific taxa from 7 divisions its spatial distribution demonstrated continuity in the floristic structure at the divisions level the main portion of the floristic diversity was formed by cyanobacteria bacillariophyta and chlorophyta both in the lake and in the sand quarry table 2 the distribution of genera and species was distinguished by discrete patterns the phytoplankton taxonomic diversity was higher in the lake than in the sand quarry at the genera level 40 higher and at the species level 70 higher we have compared the phytoplankton communities at different observation sites in the lake and the sand quarry with sørensen species similarity index ks the highest species similarity is pertaining to phytoplankton within the sand quarry ks 0 51 0 83 table 3 lower similarity is observed for phytoplankton at different sites in the lake ks 0 36 0 49 and the lowest between the lake phytoplankton and the sand quarry phytoplankton ks 0 28 0 38 thus phytoplankton species composition in the lake and the sand quarry differs considerably it was shown thomas et al 2007 yuan et al 2018 that phytoplankton similarity in the connected water bodies decreased in low water years as compared to high water years it is explained by the fact that water exchange between the water bodies in low water years becomes less intense which increases the spatial heterogeneity according to the data from the central geophysical observatory kyiv ukraine the dnieper river flow rate has been low during the recent years www cgo kiev ua in the view of the above we suppose that the low flow rate is an important abiotic factor contributing to the differences in the lake s and the sand quarry s phytoplankton species composition therefore further studies are required to build a fuller picture of phytoplankton spatial distribution in kardashynskyi liman lake in particular it is necessary to conduct a similar research in high water years floristic spectrum nucleus is an important taxonomic parameter widely used in comparative floristics it is a list of genera represented by the highest numbers of species and infraspecific taxa as it can be seen from table 4 the phytoplankton floristic structure at the level of genera was marked by higher diversity in the lake than in the sand quarry given that the water bodies under study are located within an estuary it is interesting to look into the ratio of freshwater and marine organisms in them we have analyzed the phytoplankton species composition in both subsystems according to salinity preferences applying three different classifications guiry and guiry 2019 barinova et al 2006 van dam et al 1994 table 5 in accordance with the classification of algaebase guiry and guiry 2019 the lake s and the sand quarry s phytoplankton is dominated by freshwater species however one should mention occurrence of cylindrotheca closterium ehrenberg reimann j c lewin a marine diatom in the lake s phytoplankton besides both system also contain species which could inhabit both fresh and marine waters these are as a rule widespread cosmopolite species for example cyanobacteria merismopedia tenuissima lemmermann microcystis aeruginosa kützing kützing are found in the lake diatoms cyclotella meneghiniana kützing diploneis elliptica kützing cleve are found in the sand quarry and nitzschia acicularis kützing w smith stephanodiscus hantzschii grunow occur in both subsystems according to another classification barinova et al 2006 indifferent species prevail in both subsystems it is also necessary to note that the portion of halophilous species exceeds that of the halophobous species the classification developed by van dam et al 1994 takes into account diatoms only in accordance with this classification both the lake and the sand quarry are dominated by brackish freshwater species so the taxonomic composition of planktonic algae reflects the water salinity range in kardashynskyi liman lake which makes up 0 70 1 24 g dm 3 on the whole the ratio of species with different salinity preferences is similar in both subsystems so it can be expected that there is no significant difference in water salinity between the lake and the sand quarry due to hydrological connection between them however further studies are required to confirm this assumption in particular it is necessary to measure salinity in both water bodies in seasonal and long term aspect with account taken of the dnieper flow rate 3 2 3 epiphytic algae epiphytic algal communities of the natural artificial ecosystem include 170 species and infraspecific taxa from 8 divisions their spatial distribution is characterized by similar patterns as for phytoplankton as regards the continuity aspect both the lake and the sand quarry are dominated by bacillariophyta and chlorophyta are registered as subdominants however the lake has higher taxonomic diversity of epiphytic algae than the sand quarry 146 versus 52 species and infraspecific taxa and this can be considered the discreteness aspect significant taxonomic diversity of epiphytic algae in the lake is explained by high diversity of macrophytes it is well known that a large number of available habitats is a factor supporting high biodiverstity wehr and sheath 2015 alsterberg et al 2017 to assess spatial distribution of epiphytic algae it is essential to compare their communities on various substrata i e plants of different ecological groups the lowest taxonomic diversity was pertaining to epiphytic algae in the emergent plants belt higher in the floating leaf plants belt and the highest in the submerged plants belt it may be explained by larger surface area of submerged plants as compared to emergent and floating leaf macrophytes cyanobacteria cryptophyta and ochrophyta were more diverse on floating leaf plants and submerged plants than on emergent plants table 6 sørensen similarity index has been applied to compare the epiphytic algae species composition on plants of different ecological groups the results have shown that epiphytic algal communities are distributed in kardashynskyi liman lake in accordance with discrete pattern table 7 most of the obtained sørensen index values do not exceed 0 50 the lowest similarity ks 0 33 0 38 was recorded between algal communities on macrophytes relating to different ecological groups these data confirm that kardashynskyi liman lake has a large quantity of diverse habitats each marked with a specific complex of environmental variables this factor contributes to high taxonomic diversity of autotrophic communities significant dissimilarity was also recorded in the floristic spectra of epiphytic algal communities on higher plants of different ecological groups table 8 in the belts of emergent and floating leaf plants the highest species richness was observed for gomphonema and cymbella genera while on submerged plants nitzschia genus was the most diverse it may be explained by the fact that species from gomphonema and cymbella genus relate to typical epiphytes they are distinguished by heteropolar form of their frustules and are firmly attached to the substratum surface therefore they can have competitive advantage on smooth substrata such as reed stems or candock leaves or petioles in contrast species from nitzschia genus are as a rule eurytopic motile forms more favorable conditions for their growth are observed on plants with dissected leaf blades for example on c demersum l or m spicatum l cosmarium genus also showed high species richness in the belt of submerged plants the point is that species from cosmarium genus frequently grow in abundance in plankton among submerged vegetation and may sediment upon the plant surface 3 2 4 comparison of planktonic and epiphytic algal communities to assess continuity and discreteness of algal diversity it is important to compare taxonomic composition of phytoplankton and epiphytic communities the comparison was performed for the lake subsystem because it is marked by the highest diversity of algae both planktonic and epiphytic on the whole the taxonomic diversity of algae in the lake subsystem comprised 176 species and infraspecific taxa out of them 42 occurred both in plankton and epiphytic communities 29 occurred only in plankton and 105 only in epiphytic communities the sørensen index calculated for phytoplankton and epiphytic algal communities of the lake was equal to 0 38 it means that their species compositions differ significantly however a portion of species proved to be common for plankton and epiphytic communities it has been shown recently kasim 2011 liu et al 2014 zadorozhna et al 2017 that phytoplankton and epiphytic algal communities are not isolated but interact with each other and form a dynamic system presence of common species in plankton and epiphytic communities can be caused by three main mechanisms habitat versatility of species algae s sedimentation from plankton to higher aquatic plants surface and transition of typically epiphytic species to plankton due to hydrodynamic processes in the view of the above it is interesting to analyze habitat association of algae recorded in water column and upon higher aquatic plants surface in kardashynskyi liman lake out of the total phytoplankton and epiphytic algal communities species list 48 of species were typically planktonic 21 littoral 18 benthic 9 epiphytic and 6 eurytopic fig 2 among the species occurring only in plankton fig 2 typically planktonic forms prevailed 79 the portion of species with other habitat association being insignificant among the species recorded only in epiphytic communities 28 fell on benthic forms 30 on planktonic forms 21 on littoral forms 14 on epiphytic forms and 7 on eurytopic forms as regards habitat association of common species for both groups they were dominated by planktonic forms 69 thus presence of common species in the lake phytoplankton and epiphytic communities is mainly related to the process of planktonic forms settling down upon the higher plants surface this process may be considered a factor determining algal communities continuity in general the discrete continuous patterns of plant communities spatial distribution in the natural artificial aquatic ecosystem under study is summarized in table 9 in the view of the above it can be said that hydrological connection between the lake and the sand quarry is the main abiotic factor determining the autotrophic link continuity in kardashynskyi liman lake it is confirmed by meire et al 2005 believing that various habitats within estuaries do not exists in isolation but maintain different types of interaction these interactions can be physical such as water exchange sediments transport chemical transfer of nutrients and other substances and biological motile species migration meire et al 2005 besides some researchers show that hydrological connection between water bodies represents a route for passive dispersal of organisms which cannot oppose the force of current in particular planktonic algae logue et al 2011 devercelli et al 2016 hu et al 2017 the proponents of this theory consider phytoplankton inhabiting hydrologically interconnected water bodies as metacommunity therefore we may suppose that after completion of hydrotechnical operations the lake served as a key source of species for colonization of the newly formed sand quarry due to water exchange between them at the same time dissimilarities in hydromorphological parameters between the lake and the sand quarry cause the difference in their photic layer thickness and respectively the irradiance conditions the solar radiation factor in its turn determines the discrete patterns of autotrophic communities and explains their higher taxonomic diversity in the lake than in the sand quarry we think that the natural artificial ecosystem of kardashynskyi liman lake may serve to illustrate the abiotic biotic regulatory concept in accordance with this concept structure and functioning of aquatic communities in riverine ecosystems are driven by hierarchy of abiotic and biotic factors only when abiotic factors become stable and predictable biotic interactions start to manifest themselves zalewski and naiman 1985 zalewski 2015 the sand quarry s ecosystem is rather young and functioning of its autotrophic communities is mainly driven by abiotic factors the lake is an older developed ecosystem with rather stable abiotic conditions so biotic interactions become more important there for example oxygen saturation in the lake reaches 186 198 therefore we may state that the lake s oxygen conditions in summer are mainly driven by a biotic factor photosynthetic aeration of water by algae and higher aquatic plants another example of biotic interactions is that high diversity and abundant growth of aquatic plants make numerous habitats available for epiphytic algal communities due to this factor high taxonomic diversity of epiphytic algae is formed since kardashynskyi liman lake is hydrologically connected with the lower dnieper network it faces an important risk of cyanobacterial blooms observed in the dnieper reservoirs it is confirmed by occurrence of typical agents of water blooms in the lake and the sand quarry dolichospermum flosaquae brébisson ex bornet flahault p wacklin l hoffmann j komárek aphanizomenon flosaquae ralfs ex bornet flahault cuspidothrix issatschenkoi usachev p rajaniemi komárek r willame p hrouzek k kastovská l hoffmann k sivonen it is well known that planktonic cyanobacteria growth intensifies under condition of slow water exchange for example cyanobacterial blooms in sulejów reservoir central poland increase in intensity when the water retention time exceeds 30 days tarczyńska et al 2001 zalewski 2012 according to literature data timchenko 1996 ovechko et al 2015 the retention time of kardashynskyi liman lake tends to get longer thus if water exchange processes continue to weaken in the future water blooms may become more intense there the low stream flow rate of the dnieper river and abnormally high summer temperature recorded in the recent years www cgo kiev ua shcherbak 2019 are other important factors which may intensify cyanobacterial blooms in kardashynskyi liman lake in the view of the above assessing phytoplankton s seasonal and year to year dynamics in kardashynskyi liman lake its relation to the dnieper flow rate and water temperature are urgent tasks for our further studies these factors must also be taken into account in long term forecasts and in developing practical recommendations for conservation of the unique dnieper bug estuary and mitigation of risks for its functioning 4 conclusion current hydrotechnical impact upon aquatic ecosystems causes a unique type of water bodies to appear which combine natural and artificial habitats in a single system spatial distribution of plant communities in them is marked by discrete continuous patterns for higher aquatic plants the continuity aspect consists in overgrowth of emergent plants all round the shoreline in both subsystems the discreteness aspect is observed in presence of floating leaf and submerged plants in the lake subsystem only and their absence in the sand quarry for phytoplankton and epiphytic algae continuity manifests itself in predominance of the same divisions in both subsystems discreteness is noticed in higher taxonomic and floristic diversity of algae in the natural subsystem than in the artificial one the process of interaction between phytoplankton and epiphytic algae is another important mechanism sustaining continuity of algal communities the natural artificial ecosystem of kardashynskyi liman lake may serve to illustrate the abiotic biotic regulatory concept zalewski and naiman 1985 zalewski 2015 the sand quarry ecosystem is rather young and functioning of its autotrophic communities is mainly driven by abiotic variables morphometry water transparency retention time temperature conditions at the same time biotic factors start to manifest themselves in the older developed ecosystem of the lake especially in summer season these biotic factors include high diversity and abundant growth of aquatic vegetation photosynthetic aeration of water by algae and higher aquatic plants conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the

1089,spatial distribution of plant communities in the human modified aquatic ecosystem within the dnieper bug estuary is marked by discrete continuous patterns continuity is caused by hydrological interconnection between the subsystems and discreteness by habitat diversity for higher aquatic plants the continuity aspect consists in overgrowth of emergent plants all round the shoreline in both subsystems the discreteness aspect is noticed in presence of floating leaf plants and submerged plants belts in the natural subsystem only the lake and their absence in the artificial one the sand quarry for algal communities continuity is observed in predominance of the same divisions in both subsystems discreteness manifests itself in higher taxonomic and floristic diversity of algae in the natural subsystem than in the artificial one the process of hydrological interaction between phytoplankton and epiphytic algae is another important mechanism sustaining continuity of algal communities

freshwater and marine organisms and distinguished by high productivity and life concentration odum 1953 wolanski 2013 these are dynamic ecosystems with perpetual fluctuations of physical chemical and biological parameters paturej 2006 lobry et al 2008 nyitrai et al 2012 estuaries exhibit high structural and functional biodiversity ahel et al 1996 meire et al 2005 and act as ecological gateways for alien aquatic species migration gruszka 1999 these aquatic ecosystems are very important from economic and recreational points of view therefore it is essential to assess environmental risks for estuarine ecosystems in order to integrate ecological management with sustainable economy kowalewska kalkowska and kowalewski 2004 today serious ecological risks are associated with hydrotechnical works on sand recovery and bottom dredging for navigation purposes hydrotechnical operations cause fragmentation or loss of aquatic and wetland habitats waltham and connolly 2007 and can reduce aquatic biodiversity mohamamad and jalal 2018 this type of human impact often transforms estuaries and creates new natural artificial water bodies within them sand extraction is among key factors affecting the dnieper bug estuary for instance a large artificial quarry was dug near kardashynskyi liman lake in the early 2000s after the quarry had connected with the natural lake a new type of aquatic ecosystem emerged within the dnieper bug estuary a human modified one at present this human modified ecosystem consists of two interconnected subsystems a natural one the lake itself and an artificial one the newly created sand quarry in order to develop scientific rationale for protection conservation and sustainable use of unique estuary ecosystems it is necessary to assess their biodiversity this is particularly important for plant communities diversity because they compose the primary link of energy flow and regulate the water quality it is known manoylov et al 2016 that serious environmental risks such as hypoxia fish mortality are often preceded by changes in the primary producers species composition therefore data on autotrophic communities diversity in estuarine ecosystems can become a scientific background for preventing large scale hazards to their functioning one should note that publications on biodiversity in interconnected natural artificial ecosystems within estuaries are quite scarce waltham and connolly 2007 2013 as regards kardashynskyi liman lake the most recent published data relate to its natural subsystem only and were obtained during 2003 2013 ovechko et al 2015 however the ecological situation in the lake has changed for the past five years among other things it is explained by reduction of water volume flowing via the north crimean canal and respectively by increase in the water releases through the kakhovka hydropower plant dam to the dnieper bug estuary in the view of the above it is required to obtain the latest data on the diversity of autotrophic communities in the subsystems of kardashynskyi liman lake this paper deals with the results of field studies carried out in summer 2017 given the fact that this natural artificial subsystem is very interesting from hydrological and hydrobiological viewpoints there is an urgent necessity to continue these preliminary studies therefore in the years to come we will explore seasonal and long term dynamics of plant communities and the main abiotic factors making effect upon them including water salinity and nutrient content we will also consider present day

al 2015 the ammonium nitrogen concentration in the lake in summer season makes up 0 28 0 45 mg n dm 3 and inorganic phosphorus concentration 0 032 0 145 mg p dm 3 therefore the lake is eutrophic we have not found any data on the sand quarry s salinity and nutrients concentration in the available literature so it is necessary to study these important abiotic factors in the future on the whole each of the water bodies under study is marked by a distinctive complex of abiotic factors which make effect upon autotrophic communities 3 2 autotrophic communities plant communities higher aquatic

of the water body s depth our observation results are confirmed by the data from literature it is known that submerged plants can spread only to certain depth limit below which the solar radiation availability becomes too low for them to photosynthesize vestergaard and sand jensen 2000 zingel et al 2006 rosińska and gołdyn 2015 phillips et al 2016 such depth limit is highly correlated with water clarity 3 2 2 phytoplankton phytoplankton of the natural artificial water ecosystem under study was represented by 88 species and infraspecific taxa from 7 divisions its spatial distribution demonstrated continuity in the floristic structure at the divisions level the main portion of the floristic diversity was formed by cyanobacteria bacillariophyta and chlorophyta both in the lake and in the sand quarry table 2 the distribution of genera and species was distinguished by discrete patterns the phytoplankton taxonomic diversity was higher in the lake than in the sand quarry at the genera level 40 higher and at the species level 70 higher we have compared the phytoplankton communities at different observation sites in the lake and the sand quarry with sørensen species similarity index ks the highest species similarity is pertaining to phytoplankton within the sand quarry ks 0 51 0 83 table 3 lower similarity is observed for phytoplankton at different sites in the lake ks 0 36 0 49 and the lowest between the lake phytoplankton and the sand quarry phytoplankton ks 0 28 0 38 thus phytoplankton species composition in the lake and the sand quarry differs considerably it was shown thomas et al 2007 yuan et al 2018 that phytoplankton similarity in the connected water bodies decreased in low water years as compared to high water years it is explained by the fact that water exchange between the water bodies in low water years becomes less intense which increases the spatial heterogeneity according to the data from the central geophysical observatory kyiv ukraine the dnieper river flow rate has been low during the recent years www cgo kiev ua in the view of the above we suppose that the low flow rate is an important abiotic factor contributing to the differences in the lake s and the sand quarry s phytoplankton species composition therefore further studies are required to build a fuller picture of phytoplankton spatial distribution in kardashynskyi liman lake in particular it is necessary to conduct a similar research in high water years floristic spectrum nucleus is an important taxonomic parameter widely used in comparative floristics it is a list of genera represented by the highest numbers of species and infraspecific taxa as it can be seen from table 4 the phytoplankton floristic structure at the level of genera was marked by higher diversity in the lake than in the sand quarry given that the water bodies under study are located within an estuary it is interesting to look into the ratio of freshwater and marine organisms in them we have analyzed the phytoplankton species composition in both subsystems according to salinity preferences applying three different classifications guiry and guiry 2019 barinova et al 2006 van dam et al 1994 table 5 in accordance with the classification of algaebase guiry and guiry 2019 the lake s and the sand quarry s phytoplankton is dominated by freshwater species however one should mention occurrence of cylindrotheca closterium ehrenberg reimann j c lewin a marine diatom in the lake s phytoplankton besides both system also contain species which could inhabit both fresh and marine waters these are as a rule widespread cosmopolite species for example cyanobacteria merismopedia tenuissima lemmermann microcystis aeruginosa kützing kützing are found in the lake diatoms cyclotella meneghiniana kützing diploneis elliptica kützing cleve are found in the sand quarry and nitzschia acicularis kützing w smith stephanodiscus hantzschii grunow occur in both subsystems according to another classification barinova et al 2006 indifferent species prevail in both subsystems it is also necessary to note that the portion of halophilous species exceeds that of the halophobous species the classification developed by van dam et al 1994 takes into account diatoms only in accordance with this classification both the lake and the sand quarry are dominated by brackish freshwater species so the taxonomic composition of planktonic algae reflects the water salinity range in kardashynskyi liman lake which makes up 0 70 1 24 g dm 3 on the whole the ratio of species with different salinity preferences is similar in both subsystems so it can be expected that there is no significant difference in water salinity between the lake and the sand quarry due to hydrological connection between them however further studies are required to confirm this assumption in particular it is necessary to measure salinity in both water bodies in seasonal and long term aspect with account taken of the dnieper flow rate 3 2 3 epiphytic algae epiphytic algal communities of the natural artificial ecosystem include 170 species and infraspecific taxa from 8 divisions their spatial distribution is characterized by similar patterns as for phytoplankton as regards the continuity aspect both the lake and the sand quarry are dominated by bacillariophyta and chlorophyta are registered as subdominants however the lake has higher taxonomic diversity of epiphytic algae than the sand quarry 146 versus 52 species and infraspecific taxa and this can be considered the discreteness aspect significant taxonomic diversity of epiphytic algae in the lake is explained by high diversity of macrophytes it is well known that a large number of available habitats is a factor supporting high biodiverstity wehr and sheath 2015 alsterberg et al 2017 to assess spatial distribution of epiphytic algae it is essential to compare their communities on various substrata i e plants of different ecological groups the lowest taxonomic diversity was pertaining to epiphytic algae in the emergent plants belt higher in the floating leaf plants belt and the highest in the submerged plants belt it may be explained by larger surface area of submerged plants as compared to emergent and floating leaf macrophytes cyanobacteria cryptophyta and ochrophyta were more diverse on floating leaf plants and submerged plants than on emergent plants table 6 sørensen similarity index has been applied to compare the epiphytic algae species composition on plants of different ecological groups the results have shown that epiphytic algal communities are distributed in kardashynskyi liman lake in accordance with discrete pattern table 7 most of the obtained sørensen index values do not exceed 0 50 the lowest similarity ks 0 33 0 38 was recorded between algal communities on macrophytes relating to different ecological groups these data confirm that kardashynskyi liman lake has a large quantity of diverse habitats each marked with a specific complex of environmental variables this factor contributes to high taxonomic diversity of autotrophic communities significant dissimilarity was also recorded in the floristic spectra of epiphytic algal communities on higher plants of different ecological groups table 8 in the belts of emergent and floating leaf plants the highest species richness was observed for gomphonema and cymbella genera while on submerged plants nitzschia genus was the most diverse it may be explained by the fact that species from gomphonema and cymbella genus relate to typical epiphytes they are distinguished by heteropolar form of their frustules and are firmly attached to the substratum surface therefore they can have competitive advantage on smooth substrata such as reed stems or candock leaves or petioles in contrast species from nitzschia genus are as a rule eurytopic motile forms more favorable conditions for their growth are observed on plants with dissected leaf blades for example on c demersum l or m spicatum l cosmarium genus also showed high species richness in the belt of submerged plants the point is that species from cosmarium genus frequently grow in abundance in plankton among submerged vegetation and may sediment upon the plant surface 3 2 4 comparison of planktonic and epiphytic algal communities to assess continuity and discreteness of algal diversity it is important to compare taxonomic composition of phytoplankton and epiphytic communities the comparison was performed for the lake subsystem because it is marked by the highest diversity of algae both planktonic and epiphytic on the whole the taxonomic diversity of algae in the lake subsystem comprised 176 species and infraspecific taxa out of them 42 occurred both in plankton and epiphytic communities 29 occurred only in plankton and 105 only in epiphytic communities the sørensen index calculated for phytoplankton and epiphytic algal communities of the lake was equal to 0 38 it means that their species compositions differ significantly however a portion of species proved to be common for plankton and epiphytic communities it has been shown recently kasim 2011 liu et al 2014 zadorozhna et al 2017 that phytoplankton and epiphytic algal communities are not isolated but interact with each other and form a dynamic system presence of common species in plankton and epiphytic communities can be caused by three main mechanisms habitat versatility of species algae s sedimentation from plankton to higher aquatic plants surface and transition of typically epiphytic species to plankton due to hydrodynamic processes in the view of the above it is interesting to analyze habitat association of algae recorded in water column and upon higher aquatic plants surface in kardashynskyi liman lake out of the total phytoplankton and epiphytic algal communities species list 48 of species were typically planktonic 21 littoral 18 benthic 9 epiphytic and 6 eurytopic fig 2 among the species occurring only in plankton fig 2 typically planktonic forms prevailed 79 the portion of species with other habitat association being insignificant among the species recorded only in epiphytic communities 28 fell on benthic forms 30 on planktonic forms 21 on littoral forms 14 on epiphytic forms and 7 on eurytopic forms as regards habitat association of common species for both groups they were dominated by planktonic forms 69 thus presence of common species in the lake phytoplankton and epiphytic communities is mainly related to the process of planktonic forms settling down upon the higher plants surface this process may be considered a factor determining algal communities continuity in general the discrete continuous patterns of plant communities spatial distribution in the natural artificial aquatic ecosystem under study is summarized in table 9 in the view of the above it can be said that hydrological connection between the lake and the sand quarry is the main abiotic factor determining the autotrophic link continuity in kardashynskyi liman lake it is confirmed by meire et al 2005 believing that various habitats within estuaries do not exists in isolation but maintain different types of interaction these interactions can be physical such as water exchange sediments transport chemical transfer of nutrients and other substances and biological motile species migration meire et al 2005 besides some researchers show that hydrological connection between water bodies represents a route for passive dispersal of organisms which cannot oppose the force of current in particular planktonic algae logue et al 2011 devercelli et al 2016 hu et al 2017 the proponents of this theory consider phytoplankton inhabiting hydrologically interconnected water bodies as metacommunity therefore we may suppose that after completion of hydrotechnical operations the lake served as a key source of species for colonization of the newly formed sand quarry due to water exchange between them at the same time dissimilarities in hydromorphological parameters between the lake and the sand quarry cause the difference in their photic layer thickness and respectively the irradiance conditions the solar radiation factor in its turn determines the discrete patterns of autotrophic communities and explains their higher taxonomic diversity in the lake than in the sand quarry we think that the natural artificial ecosystem of kardashynskyi liman lake may serve to illustrate the abiotic biotic regulatory concept in accordance with this concept structure and functioning of aquatic communities in riverine ecosystems are driven by hierarchy of abiotic and biotic factors only when abiotic factors become stable and predictable biotic interactions start to manifest themselves zalewski and naiman 1985 zalewski 2015 the sand quarry s ecosystem is rather young and functioning of its autotrophic communities is mainly driven by abiotic factors the lake is an older developed ecosystem with rather stable abiotic conditions so biotic interactions become more important there for example oxygen saturation in the lake reaches 186 198 therefore we may state that the lake s oxygen conditions in summer are mainly driven by a biotic factor photosynthetic aeration of water by algae and higher aquatic plants another example of biotic interactions is that high diversity and abundant growth of aquatic plants make numerous habitats available for epiphytic algal communities due to this factor high taxonomic diversity of epiphytic algae is formed since kardashynskyi liman lake is hydrologically connected with the lower dnieper network it faces an important risk of cyanobacterial blooms observed in the dnieper reservoirs it is confirmed by occurrence of typical agents of water blooms in the lake and the sand quarry dolichospermum flosaquae brébisson ex bornet flahault p wacklin l hoffmann j komárek aphanizomenon flosaquae ralfs ex bornet flahault cuspidothrix issatschenkoi usachev p rajaniemi komárek r willame p hrouzek k kastovská l hoffmann k sivonen it is well known that planktonic cyanobacteria growth intensifies under condition of slow water exchange for example cyanobacterial blooms in sulejów reservoir central poland increase in intensity when the water retention time exceeds 30 days tarczyńska et al 2001 zalewski 2012 according to literature data timchenko 1996 ovechko et al 2015 the retention time of kardashynskyi liman lake tends to get longer thus if water exchange processes continue to weaken in the future water blooms may become more intense there the low stream flow rate of the dnieper river and abnormally high summer temperature recorded in the recent years www cgo kiev ua shcherbak 2019 are other important factors which may intensify cyanobacterial blooms in kardashynskyi liman lake in the view of the above assessing phytoplankton s seasonal and year to year dynamics in kardashynskyi liman lake its relation to the dnieper flow rate and water temperature are urgent tasks for our further studies these factors must also be taken into account in long term forecasts and in developing practical recommendations for conservation of the unique dnieper bug estuary and mitigation of risks for its functioning 4 conclusion current hydrotechnical impact upon aquatic ecosystems causes a unique type of water bodies to appear which combine natural and artificial habitats in a single system spatial distribution of plant communities in them is marked by discrete continuous patterns for higher aquatic plants the continuity aspect consists in overgrowth of emergent plants all round the shoreline in both subsystems the discreteness aspect is observed in presence of floating leaf and submerged plants in the lake subsystem only and their absence in the sand quarry for phytoplankton and epiphytic algae continuity manifests itself in predominance of the same divisions in both subsystems discreteness is noticed in higher taxonomic and floristic diversity of algae in the natural subsystem than in the artificial one the process of interaction between phytoplankton and epiphytic algae is another important mechanism sustaining continuity of algal communities the natural artificial ecosystem of kardashynskyi liman lake may serve to illustrate the abiotic biotic regulatory concept zalewski and naiman 1985 zalewski 2015 the sand quarry ecosystem is rather young and functioning of its autotrophic communities is mainly driven by abiotic variables morphometry water transparency retention time temperature conditions at the same time biotic factors start to manifest themselves in the older developed ecosystem of the lake especially in summer season these biotic factors include high diversity and abundant growth of aquatic vegetation photosynthetic aeration of water by algae and higher aquatic plants conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the
