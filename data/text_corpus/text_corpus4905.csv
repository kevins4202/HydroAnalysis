24525,river algal blooms have become a complex and challenging environmental issue due to the impacts of human activities and inter basin water transfer project as the water source of the middle route project mrp of south to north water diversion project snwdp the hanjiang river hr has experienced frequent algal blooms and this caused potential risk to the drinking water safety of residents along the river here an integrated river algal bloom model was developed to simulate river algal blooms and analyze the effects of mrp of snwdp on algal bloom occurrence patterns in the middle lower hr the integrated river algal bloom model considered multiple physical chemical biological processes which include the hydrological cycle of basin the interactive mechanisms of river hydrodynamics and the improved algal dynamics process by adding a hydrology factor the results show that the relative error between simulated and observed algae density at the qin duankou qdk and zongguan zg sections are 17 1 and 18 5 during the calibration period and are 18 3 and 19 7 during the validation period indicating that the proposed integrated algal bloom model met the basic requirements for simulating river algal blooms additionally our analysis indicates that the occurrence of algal bloom events in the middle lower hr will increase by about two fold under the water transfer scenario of 9 5 billion m3 year 1 and 2 5 fold under the scenario of 13 billion m3 year 1 at the qdk section this study potentially provides scientific tool for local governments to carry out optimal scheduling of water conservancy projects for the protection of water ecological environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords river algal blooms integrated model south to north water diversion project middle lower hanjiang river 1 introduction to mitigate the imbalance between growing water demand and limited quantity of available water many countries have constructed regional water transfer projects to dispatch water resources biswas 2004 in recent years there are a lot of water transfer projects currently in operation in the united states australia china etc such as the north american waterscape benjamin and patrick 2012 the lake chenghai water diversion projects zou et al 2014 and the chinese south to north water diversion project snwdp gu et al 2012 previous studies emphasized that water diversion from one river basin to another are typically complex multi process problems and it might change the hydrological regimes water quality and aquatic ecological structure yevjevich 2001 allam et al 2015 wang et al 2016 due to the impact of large water conservancy projects frequent outbreaks of river algal blooms have gradually become a serious water eco environmental issue in many large rivers in recent years xia et al 2019 as the largest tributary of the yangtze river the hanjiang river hr was dammed by the middle route project mrp of the snwdp which transferring water from hanjiang and this has led to profound and complex effects on environment in the middle lower hr wei et al 2016 recently the hr has experienced continuous algal blooms which is quite rare in such large running river all over the world yang et al 2012 cheng et al 2019 changes in hydrological regimes led by human activities was particularly prominent for the outbreak of river algal blooms yang et al 2017 kim et al 2019 however owing to the complexity and effects of human activities the formation mechanisms and occurrence risk of river algal blooms are still unclear in hr therefore scientific simulating river algal blooms and assessing the influence of snwdp on it in hr has received national attention and this has become a precondition of decision making for comprehensive water resources management at basin scale in the past decades the environmental impacts resulting from water transfer projects received extensive attention of both government administrators and scientists mitrovic et al 2010 kim et al 2017 chen et al 2019 the water eco environment models coupling the schedule rules of water transfer project are the key scientific solutions for investigating the effects of water transfer project on ecological environment li et al 2012 xia et al 2019 numerical studies have been conducted to analyze the potential environment impacts of water transfer project on waters at catchment scale for example li et al 2014 developed a three dimensional unstructured mesh eco dynamic model to simulate the temporal and spatial variations of algal bloom in the xiangxi river under the impact of the three gorges project in china ji et al 2017 assessed the impacts of water level rise on algal bloom prevention in the tributary of the yangtze river and found that the effective water circulation patterns occurred when there was a converging of the inflow from the upstream with an intrusive overflow lower interflow and underflow yang et al 2017 investigated the disturbance induced phytoplankton regime shifts and recovery of cyanobacteria dominance in two subtropical reservoirs which provided empirical support for responses of plankton community composition moreover natural water algae growth and dissolution process can be also complex under river hydrological condition bowen and harrigan 2018 hong et al 2018 the results of di toro et al 1971 showed that the algae growth rate was generally affected by phytoplankton species nutrients water temperature and light conditions however the above conclusion was obtained by using a mechanistic model for eutrophication studies in small lakes or reservoirs under indoor static test conditions compared with water eutrophication in lakes and reservoirs algal blooms in large river systems can cause more severe consequences to watershed ecosystems at the catchment scale bowes et al 2011 descy et al 2014 thus it is urgently needed to it is urgently needed to conduct forecasting on large scale river algal blooms algae growth module is the core component of phytoplankton ecological dynamics model and it has the most direct impact on algae growth and extinction under the influence of river hydrodynamic conditions hao et al 2010 some researches and laboratory test results of algal blooms indicate that the change of river hydrological regimes e g flow rate flow velocity and water level will have agitation effect on algae growth during the dynamic process of nutrient absorption kim et al 2014 oliver et al 2014 sabater liesa et al 2018 wang et al 2019 for instance kim et al 2017 simulated the algal blooms in han river south korea based on the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc and found that the hydrodynamic conditions for the upstream and downstream regions could change the appropriate maximum growth rates for algal groups shen et al 2019 simulated the estuary algal blooms process using support vector machine svm and the results showed that the algal bloom is highly modulated by the hydrodynamic condition it is noted that most of algae ecological models were established based on the lake or indoor experimental conditions with less consideration for the impact of watershed hydrological processes under changing environment especially the impact of water transfer project and hydrological cycle at catchment scale additionally the hr has predominant agricultural economy and the frequent algal blooms in middle lower hr has posed a great threat to the safety of the drinking water for local residents and dispatch of the upstream water conservancy project therefore it is essential to develop an integrated model to provide scientific decision support on assessing the impact of water transfer project on ecological environment in hr the purpose of this study is to simulate river algal blooms in the middle lower reaches of hr and to analyze the variation of river algal blooms under the different operation scenarios of mrp of snwdp to better conduct the river algal blooms simulation and its response to the water transfer project at the basin scale an integrated river algal bloom model including a distributed hydrological model a one dimensional 1d hydrodynamic model a 1d water quality model and an improved phytoplankton kinetics model has been developed for modelling river algal blooms and effect evaluation of mrp of snwdp in middle lower hr this study is expected to provide a scientific tool for revealing the inherent laws of river algal blooms as well as the optimal scheduling of water conservancy projects for the government s decision making 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the han river is the largest tributary of the yangtze river and the freshwater source of the mrp of snwdp in china the length of the main river is approximately 1577km originating from shaanxi province and flows east across the southern part of shaanxi province into hubei province the hr basin 106 25 114 33 e and 30 17 34 33 n in central china has an area of about 159 000 km2 the middle lower hr referring to the mainstream form the danjiangkou reservoir djkr to the river month in wuhan city is selected as the study area fig 1 the total area

shortages in more than 20 major cities including beijing and tian and other cities in henan and hebei province in north china the total length of the main channel for the mrp of snwdp is approximately 1 432 km consisting of the main canal and the tianjin branch eb snwdp 2018 water can flow all the way by gravity generated by an altitude drop of about 100 m from canal head to beijing even crossing the yellow river the mrp of snwdp began to divert water in 2014 and the average annual water transfer quantity is about 4 64 billion m3 during 2015 to 2018 xin et al 2020 the mrp of snwdp is projected to extract 9 5 billion m3 from the reservoir annually with the long term goal of diverting 13 billion m3 yr 1 of water expected to achieved in 2030 long et al 2020 the water supply is highly depended on the hydrological regime in the hr the water ecological security of the river is critically important for the social economic development of the watershed 2 2 data description the input data

and environmental supervision authority 2 3 the framework and modules of the integrated river algal bloom model the river algal blooms are not only related to water quality but also very sensitive to the watershed hydrologic process changed by human activities in previous studies xia et al 2019 to address this issue it is essential to develop and implement a comprehensive river algal bloom model that can consider the hydrological processes the river hydrodynamic process and the algae ecological dynamics process at the same time in this study the proposed integrated river algal bloom model consists of a distributed hydrological model a one dimensional 1d hydrodynamic model a 1d water quality model and a phytoplankton kinetics model the major interactions between these modules are described as follows 1 the distributed hydrological model simulate the dynamic runoff for in stream routing and transformation in other modules 2 through the hydrodynamic model the essential hydrological boundary for the simulation of water quality transport and transformation is calculated 3 the water quality model and the phytoplankton kinetics model simulate the water quality and algae density respectively the framework of this comprehensive model is shown in fig 2 our study takes an important step forward to develop a physically based integrated model for algal bloom modelling and effective evaluation of inter basin water diversion projects under different water transfer scenarios in middle lower hr the brief description and critical equations of each module of integrated model are presented as follows 2 3 1 distributed time variant gain model dtvgm the distributed time variant gain model dtvgm was adopted to calculate runoff generation and routing at the catchment scale which was equivalent to a special form of the second order of nonlinear volterra functional series xia 1991 xia et al 1997 a brief description of dtvgm in its original form is provided below with more detailed information available from xia et al 2005 the dtvgm simulates runoff generation and flow routing processes by assuming that surface runoff coefficient was time variant and nonlinearly dependent on the soil moisture conditions the data and information required for the dtvgm model include meteorological inputs daily precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature and wind speed soil texture and vegetation type the dtvgm has been successfully applied to more than forty river basins across the world wang et al 2009 xia et al 2005 ye et al 2010 zou et al 2017 based on the dem dtvgm divides the entire catchment into sub catchments and then divides each sub catchment into hydrologic units based on different land use and soil type in this study the streamflow simulated by dtvgm was treated as the downstream flow of the hr to other models 2 3 2 hydrodynamic model and water quality model a one dimensional 1d hydrodynamic model is used for hydrodynamic simulation for one dimensional unsteady flow in rivers it is the numerical solution of the saint venant equation venant 1871 which is widely used to describe the flows in rivers the one dimensional saint venant equation can be described as follows 1 b z t q x q q t δ u q x g a b u 2 z x u 2 a x z g n 2 q q a r 4 3 q v where a is cross section area of river channel m2 r is hydraulic radius m b is water surface width m

developed unconditional stable preissmann four point implicit difference scheme with weight coefficient no 0 5 preissmann 1961 was used to discretize the equation 1 into linear equation for solution with boundary and initial conditions in addition a 1d water quality model luo and song 2000 was adopted to simulate the migration and transformation of nutrients in river channels 2 3 3 phytoplankton kinetics model and improvement the massive reproduction of phytoplankton is the primary cause of river algal blooms based on the water quality analysis simulation program wasp ambrose 1988 an improved phytoplankton kinetics model fig 3 was used to simulate the density of algae in the river in this study the change in algae density in the river channel is the most direct reflection of phytoplankton growth in river algal blooms the effective source term s r for phytoplankton including reproduction mortality and sedimentation can be calculated as follows 2 s r g p l d p l k s 4 p h y t where phyt is the density of algae in the river cells l gpl is the growth rate of the algae d 1 dpl is the algae mortality d 1 and ks4 is the effective sedimentation rate of algae d 1 in this study refer to the lu et al 2000 dou et al 2002 and cheng et al 2019 we adopted the suggested threshold 107 cells l to determine the outbreak of algal blooms in the han river i e the presence and absence of blooms is defined by algae density 10 7 cells l and 10 7 cells l respectively 1 algae growth module based on previous studies for modelling algal blooms in the hr cheng et al 2019 xia et al 2012 we found that hydrological factors such as water level variation can play a very important role in the occurrence of algal blooms in this study a hydrology factor g h was added to improve the traditional algae growth module in wasp model to reflect the influence of hydrological processes in river systems the improved algae growth module is expressed as follows 3 g p l g max g t g n g i g h where gp1 is the growth rate of algae day 1 gmax is the maximum growth rate of algae at 20 c g t is the temperature impact factor g n is the nutrient impact factor g i is the light impact factor and g h is the water level impact factor the nutrient limiting factor is described as follows di toro et al 1971 xie et al 2005 4 g n min d i n k m n d i n d i p k m p d i p where dip and din represent the nutrient concentrations of inorganic phosphorus mg l and inorganic nitrogen mg l in the water respectively k mn and k mp are the half saturation constants mg l for din and dip respectively the temperature impact factor is calculated as follows di toro et al 1971 xie et al 2005 5 g t θ i r t 20 where g t is the temperature factor t is the measured water temperature c and θ1r is the temperature coefficient of the algal respiration rate the light impact factor is expressed as xia et al 2001 xie et al 2005 6 g i l l opi exp 1 l l o p i where g i is light impact factor l is the amount of light radiation l opi is the optimal amount of light radiation for algae growth according to xia et al 2019 and cheng et al 2019 the water level variation in hr is a very important factor for predicting river algal bloom in this study the water level impact factor is expressed as follows 7 g h α exp β w l c v where g h is water level impact factor α and β are the constants of the influence of coefficient of variation for water level wlcv on the growth of algae and β 0 in this study based on the daily water level records the series of coefficient of variation for water level at 10 day scale were calculated 1 algae extinction submodule the endogenous respiration and natural mortality were considered in the calculation of algae extinction and decay ambrose 1988 biswas 2004 di toro et al 1971 8 d p l k i d k i r 9 k i r t k i r 20 c θ i r t 20 where dpl is restriction factor of algae extinction kid d 1 is natural mortality of algae kir is endogenous respiration rate of algae at 20 c usually greatly affected by temperature in the range of 0 05 0 20 d 1 and θir is usually taken as 1 045 1 algae sedimentation submodule the mechanism of algae precipitation and degradation in river systems is complex generally the sedimentation rate of algae is determined by the laboratory experiments under static conditions the sedimentation rate of algae in the water of large rivers could be affected by the vertical turbulence of the rivers or estuaries the density of the water bodies and the water density gradient the above influence factors are weaker in rivers than in lakes but still significant for the total production of algae the algal sedimentation rate is an important source of nutrients and can be computed as follows 10 k s 4 v s 4 d where ks4 d 1 is effective sedimentation rate of algae vs4 m d 1 is net sedimentation rate of algae and d m is the average depth refer to the user guide of the wasp ambrose et al 1998 vs4 takes the value of 0 1 in this study 2 3 4 parameter sensitivity analysis and model calibration in this study a simple and efficient perturbation analysis method was used for parameter sensitivity analysis the perturbation analysis method was conducted by repeatedly adding a small change to one parameter at a time while other parameters were kept unchanged the sensitivity index was calculated by the following formula 11 i y 1 y 0 y 0 δ x x 0 where i is the sensitivity index x 0 is the initial value of the parameter y 0 is the integrated model output of response variable i e runoff water quality concentration or algae density in our study corresponding to x 0 δ x is the change of parameter and y 1 is the integrated model output of response variable corresponding to x 0 δ x referring to zhang et al 2013 and lenhart et al 2002 the sensitivity degree can be divided into four classes i iv insensitive moderate sensitive high sensitive and very high sensitive table 1 based on previous work of xia et al 2005 wang et al 2009 and xie et al 2005 the ranges of 17 model parameters table 2 were included in the parameter sensitivity analysis parameter calibration was performed from upstream to downstream in middle lower hr from runoffs to water quality concentrations and then to algae density the selected sensitivity parameters of the integrated model were calibrated using the shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 three statistical indices including the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the correlation coefficient r and relative error re were used to evaluate the model performance 12 n s e 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i s 2 13 r i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 14 re o s o where o and s are observed and simulated values respectively and n is the number of values o and s are averages of the observed and simulated values respectively 2 4 calculation of river algal blooms outbreak probability a river algal bloom event is a short term continuous process that usually lasts from one week to half a month cheng et al 2019 using the traditional probabilistic method of peer to peer statistics could overestimate the predicted number of blooms in this study as algal blooms generally lasted around 10 days in the han river cheng et al 2019 xia et al 2016 each month was divided into three periods i e the early 10 day period the middle 10 day period and the late 10 day period if river algal blooms are repeated or continuous over several days in each period they are considered to be only one bloom event the following formula was used to calculate the random occurrence of algal blooms 15 p m a m t 100 where p is the random probability of an algal bloom occurrence ma is the number of algal blooms including blooms in the early middle and late period of each month and mt is the total number of periods 3 periods in each month based on the previous studies cheng et al 2019 xia et al 2020 xie et al 2005 algal blooms usually occur between february and april in hr thus the calculation of algal blooms outbreak probabilities was conducted between february and april and the total number of time periods mt was 81 during 2006 2014 3 results 3 1 parameter sensitivity analysis the results of parameter sensitivity analysis were shown in table 2 for the water quantity simulation the runoff generation parameters g 1 and g 2 and roughness coefficient n were the most sensitive parameters followed by the storage outflow coefficient related to interflow runoff generation k r and ground runoff generation k g the runoff generation parameters g 1 and g 2 were key parameters for the nonlinear runoff yielding process for the water quality simulation the dominantly sensitive parameters were degradation coefficient longitudinal dispersion coefficient for the nutrients for the phytoplankton kinetics simulation the endogenous respiration rate of algae k ir was the most sensitive parameters followed by the maximum growth rate of algae g max and the natural algal mortality k id 3 2 hydrological and hydrodynamic simulations the study area was divided into 137 sub basins using the dem data and the lower wuhan section was divided into independent subbasin no 1 see appendix a the outflow of the djkr was specified as the input boundary for the sub basin in the source of the study area the daily streamflow from 2006 to 2014 of the xiantao hydrological station in the middle lower hr was selected for dtvgm calibration and validation the calibration period was from 2006 to 2011 and the validation period was from 2012 to 2014 visual comparison of the observed and simulated daily streamflow are shown in fig 4 a the values of nse r and re for dtvgm calibration were 0 82 0 89 and 9 9 respectively as for model validation period the values of nse r and re were 0 78 0 85 and 12 3 respectively referring to performance measures and evaluation criteria of streamflow simulation in moriasi et al 2015 the calibrated dtvgm performed well for both high flow and low flow in a changing environment due to the nash coefficient was greater than 0 78 0 5 and relative error was less than 15 during the whole period the simulation performances of daily water level of the xiantao hydrological station during the whole simulation period were shown in fig 4b the nse values during the calibration period 0 88 and validation period 0 86 were high the re values were within 6 in both the calibration and validation periods in general the water level simulations fitted the observations well at the xiantao station 3 3 water quality and algae density simulations as shown in fig 5 the observed variations of tp and tn concentration series were well captured in the downstream portion of the han river for the tp concentration simulation the value of re values varied between 11 1 qdk and 10 5 zg for model calibration period and varied between 12 9 qdk and 12 1 zg for model validation period in both the calibration and validation period the nse values were 0 73 in both the calibration and validation periods comparatively the simulated tn concentrations were better correlated with the observed series nse 0 76 in the whole simulation period the re values varied between 9 6 qdk and 10 2 zg and between 10 8 qdk and 11 8 zg in the calibration and validation periods respectively in this study a hydrology factor g h was added to improve the traditional algae growth module in the integrated river algal bloom model to show the efficiency of the improved algae growth module the simulation results of algae density with or without g h in algae growth module were compared in fig 6 the values of the nse and r between the observed and simulated algae density at the qdk section and zg section in downstream of the hr during 2006 2014 for the simulation without g h traditional algae growth module without adding the hydrology factor g h were higher than those of the simulation with g h improved algae growth module with adding the hydrology factor g h during both calibration and validation periods the corresponding indices are supported by visual comparison of simulated and observed algae density fig 6 the comparison results demonstrated that the improved algae growth module considering the variation of flow regime could improve the accuracy of the algae density prediction based on the improved algae growth module the value of re for the simulation results of algae density was 17 1 for model calibration and 18 3 for model validation at the qdk section fig 6a the r value was 0 80 for model calibration and 0 78 for model validation at the qdk section fig 6a comparatively the value of re was 18 5 for the model calibration period and 19 7 for the model validation period at the zg section fig 6b the r values were 0 77 in the whole simulation period at zg section fig 6b the re between the simulated and measured algae density values at the qdk section and the zg section was less than 30 which meets the basic simulation and prediction requirements of the river algal bloom model kim et al 2017 wang et al 2016 yi et al 2018 thus the water quality and algae density simulations were satisfactory for both calibration and validation periods indicating the integrated model is feasible to be used in the study of river algal bloom in middle lower hr 3 4 scenario analysis based on the impoundment of the mrp of snwdp with the operation of the mrp of snwdp 9 5 billion m3 year of water will be extracted from the djkr to beijing with the long term goal of diverting 13 billion m3 year expected to be realized in 2030 flowing from the djkr in the hr to more than 20 major cities in north china long et al 2020 based on the above diversion planning three different water transfer scenarios actual water diversion 9 5 billion m3 year and 13 billion m3 year were designed to analyze the influence of water transfer projects on river algal bloom in middle lower hr the water release rates of the djkr under different design scenarios at the daily scale was specified as the input boundary condition for the integrated river algal bloom model based on the reservoir regulation of the djkr by local water conservancy department the water discharge rate was set to no less than 490 m3 s thus scenario 2 assumes an average annual water transfer of 9 5 billion m3 year from the reservoir to meet the water supply demand of north china scenario 3 assumes an average annual water transfer of 13 billion m3 year due to the large increase in the water demand in north china in the future as shown in fig 7 a and table 3 under the 9 5 m3 year water transfer scenario from 2006 to 2014 for the djkr the average algae density of the qdk section and zg section would be 0 33 10 7 cells l and 0 30 10 7 cells l respectively there would be 11 algal blooms in qdk section and 10 algal blooms in zg section respectively the corresponding outbreak probabilities of algal blooms of the qdk section and zg section were 13 58 and 12 35 respectively compared with the actual water transfer conditions the number of algal blooms increased from 6 to 11 at qdk section and from 7 to 10 at zg section table 3 under the 9 5 m3 year water transfer scenario and the increased algal blooms mainly occurred from february to march the outbreak probability of algal blooms increased from 7 41 to 13 58 at the qdk section and from 8 64 to 12 35 at the zg section table 3 under the 9 5 m3 year water transfer scenario under the 13 billion m3 year water transfer scenario fig 7 b the average algae density in the qdk section and the zg section during 2006 2014 would be 0 38 10 7 cells l and 0 32 10 7 cells l respectively 15 algal blooms occurred at qdk section and 14 algal blooms will be occurred in zg section the outbreak probabilities of algal blooms of the qdk section and zg section were 18 52 and 17 28 respectively compared with the actual conditions the number of algal blooms increased from 6 to 15 at the qdk section table 3 with the outbreak probability increasing from 7 41 to 18 52 when the long term goal of diverting 13 billion m3 year from the djkr the results showed that the long term goal of diverting 13 billion m3 year by mrp of the snwdp would significantly increase the outbreak of algal blooms in the middle lower hr 4 discussion 4 1 improvement of algae growth model in the traditional wasp phytoplankton ecological dynamics models the influence of hydrodynamic process velocity water flow etc were mainly considered in the accumulation effect of mass migration and diffusion in lake water on algae while the influence of flow regime on algae growth is not directly considered in the model based on the results of labora tory and field experiments and the previous studies xia et al 2012 chen et al 2019 xia et al 2020 it was found that there is a nonlinear response relationship between the change of water level and the algae density in the lower reaches of the hr thus in our study we add the water level regulator g h in the algae growth equation to improve the algae growth module so that it could consider the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on the change of algae reproduction in addition under the influence of climate change the flow regime of river has changed dramatically across the world morales marin et al 2019 cui et al 2020 by adding the water level regulator g h in the algae growth equation also could consider the impact of climate change on the variation of flow regime modelling results show that the accuracy of the simulated algal blooms by improved algae is improved fig 6 the above approach can be used to simulate and predict the occurrence of river algal bloom in similar estuarine confluence 4 2 prediction of river algal blooms by integrated modeling approach due to the multitude and complexity of multi factors i e hydrological environmental and ecological factors in regulating river algal blooms at multi scales developing an integrated model for simulating river algal blooms faces great challenge chen 2016 zhang et al 2017 the integrated simulation provides an effective approach to assess water quantity variation water quality deterioration and water ecology variation by considering the complicated hydrological hydrodynamic ecosystem interactions and various human activities at the catchment scale compared with hydrology and water quality the process of water ecological degradation usually has a variety of features such as cumulative effects and hysteresis therefore it is difficult to use water quality indicator only to reflect water ecological problems xia et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 comparatively the integrated model provided comprehensive simulation results for hydrological water environmental and water ecological dynamics fig 4 6 in this study reflecting the changes of hydrological conditions the transport of pollutant sources in river channels and the algae growth and death however further improvements are still needed the hydrological situation between the yangtze river yr and the hr near the mouth of the lower hr is very complicated 1d hydrodynamic model may be insufficient to simulate the effects of hydrological interactions in rivers a two dimensional or three dimensional hydrodynamic model of the river can be constructed to better describe the hydrological exchange process between the yr and the hr during a bloom period in the middle lower hr and to discriminate the physical mechanism of the interaction between hydrological changes and nutrients in the hr as well as algae growth dynamics kim et al 2017 in addition due to the data availability this study does not distinguish among cyanobacteria green algae diatoms and other categories and instead makes unified calculations for algae as a whole in future research data monitoring should be strengthened to further refine the differences in the compositions and types of algae and the effects of zooplankton as an algae predator should be further considered in the algae death module although the accuracy of the proposed integrated model was acceptable in describing the hydrological water quality and water ecology variations the model performance should be further validated with more monitoring data series model uncertainty analysis should also be performed for alleviating uncertainties and improving model structures 4 3 implications for the prevention of river algal blooms in middle lower hr most river algal blooms are closely related to the construction and implementation of water conservancy projects ha 2002 with the continued operation of different conservancy projects including dams sluices and water transfer projects hydrological cycle will be significantly changed in the river basins benjamin and patrick 2012 zhang et al 2017 such effects will certainly affect the river algal blooms and provide high requirements and challenges for the ecological protection of rivers xia et al 2019 for instance previous studies have corroborated that river algal blooms have grown frequently in several tributaries of the three gorges reservoir region in china in recent years liu 2016 zheng et al 2009 algal bloom incidents have also been found in the downstream of the hr dou et al 2002 yin 2017 the middle lower hr is an important water resource for residents in major cities along the hr the river algal bloom could cause unpleasant smell and deterioration of water quality resulting in drinking water crisis for people in wuhan city based on our proposed integrated model the probability of algal bloom in the downstream of the hr caused by the reduction of water release of djkr was estimated under the design scenarios with the average annual water transfer of 9 5 billion m3 and 13 billion m3 table 3 our analysis indicates that the occurrence of algal bloom events in the downstream of the hr will increase by about two fold at the qdk section under scenario 2 9 5 billion m3 year water transfer and 2 5 fold at qdk section and two fold at zg section under scenario 3 13 billion m3 year water transfer the results show that the moderate water transfer will not significantly increase the risk of algal bloom at the zg section in the downstream of hr while when the design scenario reaches 13 billion m3 year i e the long term goal of snwdp the water flow rate is estimated to be even lower than at present which could have remarkable impacts on the occurrence of algal blooms meanwhile flushing the river with the release of djkr is also a more practical short term option for algal bloom prevention xin et al 2020 thus it is essential to implement water hydropower joint operation or build an additional water replenishing project to increase the ecological flow of hr to reduce the risk of ecological degradation and river algal blooms 5 conclusions in this study an integrated algal bloom model was developed to simulate present and future scenarios of river algal blooms affected by the large scale water transfer project in the middle lower hr the integrated model couples the distributed hydrological model the hydrodynamic model the improved phytoplankton kinetics model and reservoir operation schedule our study takes an important step forward to develop a physically based integrated model for simulating river algal blooms and effect evaluation of water transfer projects multiple datasets at different time scales including streamflow water level tn tp and algae density were applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed integrated algal bloom model the statistical indices indicate that the proposed model could provide a good simulation of water quantity water quality and river algal bloom in the middle lower hr in a changing environment the mrp of snwdp will cause runoff decreasing the occurrence of algal bloom events in the downstream of the hr will increase by about two fold under scenario 2 9 5 billion m3 year water transfer and 2 5 fold under scenario 3 13 billion m3 year water transfer at the qdk section insights have been gained from this study that large scale water transfer projects will affect the hydrological conditions for river algal blooms it is vital to highlight the necessity of implementing predictive early warning to reduce the risk of river algal blooms affected by the water transfer project this study can be also used to improve the prediction and prevention of algal

24525,river algal blooms have become a complex and challenging environmental issue due to the impacts of human activities and inter basin water transfer project as the water source of the middle route project mrp of south to north water diversion project snwdp the hanjiang river hr has experienced frequent algal blooms and this caused potential risk to the drinking water safety of residents along the river here an integrated river algal bloom model was developed to simulate river algal blooms and analyze the effects of mrp of snwdp on algal bloom occurrence patterns in the middle lower hr the integrated river algal bloom model considered multiple physical chemical biological processes which include the hydrological cycle of basin the interactive mechanisms of river hydrodynamics and the improved algal dynamics process by adding a hydrology factor the results show that the relative error between simulated and observed algae density at the qin duankou qdk and zongguan zg sections are 17 1 and 18 5 during the calibration period and are 18 3 and 19 7 during the validation period indicating that the proposed integrated algal bloom model met the basic requirements for simulating river algal blooms additionally our analysis indicates that the occurrence of algal bloom events in the middle lower hr will increase by about two fold under the water transfer scenario of 9 5 billion m3 year 1 and 2 5 fold under the scenario of 13 billion m3 year 1 at the qdk section this study potentially provides scientific tool for local governments to carry out optimal scheduling of water conservancy projects for the protection of water ecological environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords river algal blooms integrated model south to north water diversion project middle lower hanjiang river 1 introduction to mitigate the imbalance between growing water demand and limited quantity of available water many countries have constructed regional water transfer projects to dispatch water resources biswas 2004 in recent years there are a lot of water transfer projects currently in operation in the united states australia china etc such as the north american waterscape benjamin and patrick 2012 the lake chenghai water diversion projects zou et al 2014 and the chinese south to north water diversion project snwdp gu et al 2012 previous studies emphasized that water diversion from one river basin to another are typically complex multi process problems and it might change the hydrological regimes water quality and aquatic ecological structure yevjevich 2001 allam et al 2015 wang et al 2016 due to the impact of large water conservancy projects frequent outbreaks of river algal blooms have gradually become a serious water eco environmental issue in many large rivers in recent years xia et al 2019 as the largest tributary of the yangtze river the hanjiang river hr was dammed by the middle route project mrp of the snwdp which transferring water from hanjiang and this has led to profound and complex effects on environment in the middle lower hr wei et al 2016 recently the hr has experienced continuous algal blooms which is quite rare in such large running river all over the world yang et al 2012 cheng et al 2019 changes in hydrological regimes led by human activities was particularly prominent for the outbreak of river algal blooms yang et al 2017 kim et al 2019 however owing to the complexity and effects of human activities the formation mechanisms and occurrence risk of river algal blooms are still unclear in hr therefore scientific simulating river algal blooms and assessing the influence of snwdp on it in hr has received national attention and this has become a precondition of decision making for comprehensive water resources management at basin scale in the past decades the environmental impacts resulting from water transfer projects received extensive attention of both government administrators and scientists mitrovic et al 2010 kim et al 2017 chen et al 2019 the water eco environment models coupling the schedule rules of water transfer project are the key scientific solutions for investigating the effects of water transfer project on ecological environment li et al 2012 xia et al 2019 numerical studies have been conducted to analyze the potential environment impacts of water transfer project on waters at catchment scale for example li et al 2014 developed a three dimensional unstructured mesh eco dynamic model to simulate the temporal and spatial variations of algal bloom in the xiangxi river under the impact of the three gorges project in china ji et al 2017 assessed the impacts of water level rise on algal bloom prevention in the tributary of the yangtze river and found that the effective water circulation patterns occurred when there was a converging of the inflow from the upstream with an intrusive overflow lower interflow and underflow yang et al 2017 investigated the disturbance induced phytoplankton regime shifts and recovery of cyanobacteria dominance in two subtropical reservoirs which provided empirical support for responses of plankton community composition moreover natural water algae growth and dissolution process can be also complex under river hydrological condition bowen and harrigan 2018 hong et al 2018 the results of di toro et al 1971 showed that the algae growth rate was generally affected by phytoplankton species nutrients water temperature and light conditions however the above conclusion was obtained by using a mechanistic model for eutrophication studies in small lakes or reservoirs under indoor static test conditions compared with water eutrophication in lakes and reservoirs algal blooms in large river systems can cause more severe consequences to watershed ecosystems at the catchment scale bowes et al 2011 descy et al 2014 thus it is urgently needed to it is urgently needed to conduct forecasting on large scale river algal blooms algae growth module is the core component of phytoplankton ecological dynamics model and it has the most direct impact on algae growth and extinction under the influence of river hydrodynamic conditions hao et al 2010 some researches and laboratory test results of algal blooms indicate that the change of river hydrological regimes e g flow rate flow velocity and water level will have agitation effect on algae growth during the dynamic process of nutrient absorption kim et al 2014 oliver et al 2014 sabater liesa et al 2018 wang et al 2019 for instance kim et al 2017 simulated the algal blooms in han river south korea based on the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc and found that the hydrodynamic conditions for the upstream and downstream regions could change the appropriate maximum growth rates for algal groups shen et al 2019 simulated the estuary algal blooms process using support vector machine svm and the results showed that the algal bloom is highly modulated by the hydrodynamic condition it is noted that most of algae ecological models were established based on the lake or indoor experimental conditions with less consideration for the impact of watershed hydrological processes under changing environment especially the impact of water transfer project and hydrological cycle at catchment scale additionally the hr has predominant agricultural economy and the frequent algal blooms in middle lower hr has posed a great threat to the safety of the drinking water for local residents and dispatch of the upstream water conservancy project therefore it is essential to develop an integrated model to provide scientific decision support on assessing the impact of water transfer project on ecological environment in hr the purpose of this study is to simulate river algal blooms in the middle lower reaches of hr and to analyze the variation of river algal blooms under the different operation scenarios of mrp of snwdp to better conduct the river algal blooms simulation and its response to the water transfer project at the basin scale an integrated river algal bloom model including a distributed hydrological model a one dimensional 1d hydrodynamic model a 1d water quality model and an improved phytoplankton kinetics model has been developed for modelling river algal blooms and effect evaluation of mrp of snwdp in middle lower hr this study is expected to provide a scientific tool for revealing the inherent laws of river algal blooms as well as the optimal scheduling of water conservancy projects for the government s decision making 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the han river is the largest tributary of the yangtze river and the freshwater source of the mrp of snwdp in china the length of the main river is approximately 1577km originating from shaanxi province and flows east across the southern part of shaanxi province into hubei province the hr basin 106 25 114 33 e and 30 17 34 33 n in central china has an area of about 159 000 km2 the middle lower hr referring to the mainstream form the danjiangkou reservoir djkr to the river month in wuhan city is selected as the study area fig 1 the total area

shortages in more than 20 major cities including beijing and tian and other cities in henan and hebei province in north china the total length of the main channel for the mrp of snwdp is approximately 1 432 km consisting of the main canal and the tianjin branch eb snwdp 2018 water can flow all the way by gravity generated by an altitude drop of about 100 m from canal head to beijing even crossing the yellow river the mrp of snwdp began to divert water in 2014 and the average annual water transfer quantity is about 4 64 billion m3 during 2015 to 2018 xin et al 2020 the mrp of snwdp is projected to extract 9 5 billion m3 from the reservoir annually with the long term goal of diverting 13 billion m3 yr 1 of water expected to achieved in 2030 long et al 2020 the water supply is highly depended on the hydrological regime in the hr the water ecological security of the river is critically important for the social economic development of the watershed 2 2 data description the input data

and environmental supervision authority 2 3 the framework and modules of the integrated river algal bloom model the river algal blooms are not only related to water quality but also very sensitive to the watershed hydrologic process changed by human activities in previous studies xia et al 2019 to address this issue it is essential to develop and implement a comprehensive river algal bloom model that can consider the hydrological processes the river hydrodynamic process and the algae ecological dynamics process at the same time in this study the proposed integrated river algal bloom model consists of a distributed hydrological model a one dimensional 1d hydrodynamic model a 1d water quality model and a phytoplankton kinetics model the major interactions between these modules are described as follows 1 the distributed hydrological model simulate the dynamic runoff for in stream routing and transformation in other modules 2 through the hydrodynamic model the essential hydrological boundary for the simulation of water quality transport and transformation is calculated 3 the water quality model and the phytoplankton kinetics model simulate the water quality and algae density respectively the framework of this comprehensive model is shown in fig 2 our study takes an important step forward to develop a physically based integrated model for algal bloom modelling and effective evaluation of inter basin water diversion projects under different water transfer scenarios in middle lower hr the brief description and critical equations of each module of integrated model are presented as follows 2 3 1 distributed time variant gain model dtvgm the distributed time variant gain model dtvgm was adopted to calculate runoff generation and routing at the catchment scale which was equivalent to a special form of the second order of nonlinear volterra functional series xia 1991 xia et al 1997 a brief description of dtvgm in its original form is provided below with more detailed information available from xia et al 2005 the dtvgm simulates runoff generation and flow routing processes by assuming that surface runoff coefficient was time variant and nonlinearly dependent on the soil moisture conditions the data and information required for the dtvgm model include meteorological inputs daily precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature and wind speed soil texture and vegetation type the dtvgm has been successfully applied to more than forty river basins across the world wang et al 2009 xia et al 2005 ye et al 2010 zou et al 2017 based on the dem dtvgm divides the entire catchment into sub catchments and then divides each sub catchment into hydrologic units based on different land use and soil type in this study the streamflow simulated by dtvgm was treated as the downstream flow of the hr to other models 2 3 2 hydrodynamic model and water quality model a one dimensional 1d hydrodynamic model is used for hydrodynamic simulation for one dimensional unsteady flow in rivers it is the numerical solution of the saint venant equation venant 1871 which is widely used to describe the flows in rivers the one dimensional saint venant equation can be described as follows 1 b z t q x q q t δ u q x g a b u 2 z x u 2 a x z g n 2 q q a r 4 3 q v where a is cross section area of river channel m2 r is hydraulic radius m b is water surface width m

developed unconditional stable preissmann four point implicit difference scheme with weight coefficient no 0 5 preissmann 1961 was used to discretize the equation 1 into linear equation for solution with boundary and initial conditions in addition a 1d water quality model luo and song 2000 was adopted to simulate the migration and transformation of nutrients in river channels 2 3 3 phytoplankton kinetics model and improvement the massive reproduction of phytoplankton is the primary cause of river algal blooms based on the water quality analysis simulation program wasp ambrose 1988 an improved phytoplankton kinetics model fig 3 was used to simulate the density of algae in the river in this study the change in algae density in the river channel is the most direct reflection of phytoplankton growth in river algal blooms the effective source term s r for phytoplankton including reproduction mortality and sedimentation can be calculated as follows 2 s r g p l d p l k s 4 p h y t where phyt is the density of algae in the river cells l gpl is the growth rate of the algae d 1 dpl is the algae mortality d 1 and ks4 is the effective sedimentation rate of algae d 1 in this study refer to the lu et al 2000 dou et al 2002 and cheng et al 2019 we adopted the suggested threshold 107 cells l to determine the outbreak of algal blooms in the han river i e the presence and absence of blooms is defined by algae density 10 7 cells l and 10 7 cells l respectively 1 algae growth module based on previous studies for modelling algal blooms in the hr cheng et al 2019 xia et al 2012 we found that hydrological factors such as water level variation can play a very important role in the occurrence of algal blooms in this study a hydrology factor g h was added to improve the traditional algae growth module in wasp model to reflect the influence of hydrological processes in river systems the improved algae growth module is expressed as follows 3 g p l g max g t g n g i g h where gp1 is the growth rate of algae day 1 gmax is the maximum growth rate of algae at 20 c g t is the temperature impact factor g n is the nutrient impact factor g i is the light impact factor and g h is the water level impact factor the nutrient limiting factor is described as follows di toro et al 1971 xie et al 2005 4 g n min d i n k m n d i n d i p k m p d i p where dip and din represent the nutrient concentrations of inorganic phosphorus mg l and inorganic nitrogen mg l in the water respectively k mn and k mp are the half saturation constants mg l for din and dip respectively the temperature impact factor is calculated as follows di toro et al 1971 xie et al 2005 5 g t θ i r t 20 where g t is the temperature factor t is the measured water temperature c and θ1r is the temperature coefficient of the algal respiration rate the light impact factor is expressed as xia et al 2001 xie et al 2005 6 g i l l opi exp 1 l l o p i where g i is light impact factor l is the amount of light radiation l opi is the optimal amount of light radiation for algae growth according to xia et al 2019 and cheng et al 2019 the water level variation in hr is a very important factor for predicting river algal bloom in this study the water level impact factor is expressed as follows 7 g h α exp β w l c v where g h is water level impact factor α and β are the constants of the influence of coefficient of variation for water level wlcv on the growth of algae and β 0 in this study based on the daily water level records the series of coefficient of variation for water level at 10 day scale were calculated 1 algae extinction submodule the endogenous respiration and natural mortality were considered in the calculation of algae extinction and decay ambrose 1988 biswas 2004 di toro et al 1971 8 d p l k i d k i r 9 k i r t k i r 20 c θ i r t 20 where dpl is restriction factor of algae extinction kid d 1 is natural mortality of algae kir is endogenous respiration rate of algae at 20 c usually greatly affected by temperature in the range of 0 05 0 20 d 1 and θir is usually taken as 1 045 1 algae sedimentation submodule the mechanism of algae precipitation and degradation in river systems is complex generally the sedimentation rate of algae is determined by the laboratory experiments under static conditions the sedimentation rate of algae in the water of large rivers could be affected by the vertical turbulence of the rivers or estuaries the density of the water bodies and the water density gradient the above influence factors are weaker in rivers than in lakes but still significant for the total production of algae the algal sedimentation rate is an important source of nutrients and can be computed as follows 10 k s 4 v s 4 d where ks4 d 1 is effective sedimentation rate of algae vs4 m d 1 is net sedimentation rate of algae and d m is the average depth refer to the user guide of the wasp ambrose et al 1998 vs4 takes the value of 0 1 in this study 2 3 4 parameter sensitivity analysis and model calibration in this study a simple and efficient perturbation analysis method was used for parameter sensitivity analysis the perturbation analysis method was conducted by repeatedly adding a small change to one parameter at a time while other parameters were kept unchanged the sensitivity index was calculated by the following formula 11 i y 1 y 0 y 0 δ x x 0 where i is the sensitivity index x 0 is the initial value of the parameter y 0 is the integrated model output of response variable i e runoff water quality concentration or algae density in our study corresponding to x 0 δ x is the change of parameter and y 1 is the integrated model output of response variable corresponding to x 0 δ x referring to zhang et al 2013 and lenhart et al 2002 the sensitivity degree can be divided into four classes i iv insensitive moderate sensitive high sensitive and very high sensitive table 1 based on previous work of xia et al 2005 wang et al 2009 and xie et al 2005 the ranges of 17 model parameters table 2 were included in the parameter sensitivity analysis parameter calibration was performed from upstream to downstream in middle lower hr from runoffs to water quality concentrations and then to algae density the selected sensitivity parameters of the integrated model were calibrated using the shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 three statistical indices including the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the correlation coefficient r and relative error re were used to evaluate the model performance 12 n s e 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i s 2 13 r i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 14 re o s o where o and s are observed and simulated values respectively and n is the number of values o and s are averages of the observed and simulated values respectively 2 4 calculation of river algal blooms outbreak probability a river algal bloom event is a short term continuous process that usually lasts from one week to half a month cheng et al 2019 using the traditional probabilistic method of peer to peer statistics could overestimate the predicted number of blooms in this study as algal blooms generally lasted around 10 days in the han river cheng et al 2019 xia et al 2016 each month was divided into three periods i e the early 10 day period the middle 10 day period and the late 10 day period if river algal blooms are repeated or continuous over several days in each period they are considered to be only one bloom event the following formula was used to calculate the random occurrence of algal blooms 15 p m a m t 100 where p is the random probability of an algal bloom occurrence ma is the number of algal blooms including blooms in the early middle and late period of each month and mt is the total number of periods 3 periods in each month based on the previous studies cheng et al 2019 xia et al 2020 xie et al 2005 algal blooms usually occur between february and april in hr thus the calculation of algal blooms outbreak probabilities was conducted between february and april and the total number of time periods mt was 81 during 2006 2014 3 results 3 1 parameter sensitivity analysis the results of parameter sensitivity analysis were shown in table 2 for the water quantity simulation the runoff generation parameters g 1 and g 2 and roughness coefficient n were the most sensitive parameters followed by the storage outflow coefficient related to interflow runoff generation k r and ground runoff generation k g the runoff generation parameters g 1 and g 2 were key parameters for the nonlinear runoff yielding process for the water quality simulation the dominantly sensitive parameters were degradation coefficient longitudinal dispersion coefficient for the nutrients for the phytoplankton kinetics simulation the endogenous respiration rate of algae k ir was the most sensitive parameters followed by the maximum growth rate of algae g max and the natural algal mortality k id 3 2 hydrological and hydrodynamic simulations the study area was divided into 137 sub basins using the dem data and the lower wuhan section was divided into independent subbasin no 1 see appendix a the outflow of the djkr was specified as the input boundary for the sub basin in the source of the study area the daily streamflow from 2006 to 2014 of the xiantao hydrological station in the middle lower hr was selected for dtvgm calibration and validation the calibration period was from 2006 to 2011 and the validation period was from 2012 to 2014 visual comparison of the observed and simulated daily streamflow are shown in fig 4 a the values of nse r and re for dtvgm calibration were 0 82 0 89 and 9 9 respectively as for model validation period the values of nse r and re were 0 78 0 85 and 12 3 respectively referring to performance measures and evaluation criteria of streamflow simulation in moriasi et al 2015 the calibrated dtvgm performed well for both high flow and low flow in a changing environment due to the nash coefficient was greater than 0 78 0 5 and relative error was less than 15 during the whole period the simulation performances of daily water level of the xiantao hydrological station during the whole simulation period were shown in fig 4b the nse values during the calibration period 0 88 and validation period 0 86 were high the re values were within 6 in both the calibration and validation periods in general the water level simulations fitted the observations well at the xiantao station 3 3 water quality and algae density simulations as shown in fig 5 the observed variations of tp and tn concentration series were well captured in the downstream portion of the han river for the tp concentration simulation the value of re values varied between 11 1 qdk and 10 5 zg for model calibration period and varied between 12 9 qdk and 12 1 zg for model validation period in both the calibration and validation period the nse values were 0 73 in both the calibration and validation periods comparatively the simulated tn concentrations were better correlated with the observed series nse 0 76 in the whole simulation period the re values varied between 9 6 qdk and 10 2 zg and between 10 8 qdk and 11 8 zg in the calibration and validation periods respectively in this study a hydrology factor g h was added to improve the traditional algae growth module in the integrated river algal bloom model to show the efficiency of the improved algae growth module the simulation results of algae density with or without g h in algae growth module were compared in fig 6 the values of the nse and r between the observed and simulated algae density at the qdk section and zg section in downstream of the hr during 2006 2014 for the simulation without g h traditional algae growth module without adding the hydrology factor g h were higher than those of the simulation with g h improved algae growth module with adding the hydrology factor g h during both calibration and validation periods the corresponding indices are supported by visual comparison of simulated and observed algae density fig 6 the comparison results demonstrated that the improved algae growth module considering the variation of flow regime could improve the accuracy of the algae density prediction based on the improved algae growth module the value of re for the simulation results of algae density was 17 1 for model calibration and 18 3 for model validation at the qdk section fig 6a the r value was 0 80 for model calibration and 0 78 for model validation at the qdk section fig 6a comparatively the value of re was 18 5 for the model calibration period and 19 7 for the model validation period at the zg section fig 6b the r values were 0 77 in the whole simulation period at zg section fig 6b the re between the simulated and measured algae density values at the qdk section and the zg section was less than 30 which meets the basic simulation and prediction requirements of the river algal bloom model kim et al 2017 wang et al 2016 yi et al 2018 thus the water quality and algae density simulations were satisfactory for both calibration and validation periods indicating the integrated model is feasible to be used in the study of river algal bloom in middle lower hr 3 4 scenario analysis based on the impoundment of the mrp of snwdp with the operation of the mrp of snwdp 9 5 billion m3 year of water will be extracted from the djkr to beijing with the long term goal of diverting 13 billion m3 year expected to be realized in 2030 flowing from the djkr in the hr to more than 20 major cities in north china long et al 2020 based on the above diversion planning three different water transfer scenarios actual water diversion 9 5 billion m3 year and 13 billion m3 year were designed to analyze the influence of water transfer projects on river algal bloom in middle lower hr the water release rates of the djkr under different design scenarios at the daily scale was specified as the input boundary condition for the integrated river algal bloom model based on the reservoir regulation of the djkr by local water conservancy department the water discharge rate was set to no less than 490 m3 s thus scenario 2 assumes an average annual water transfer of 9 5 billion m3 year from the reservoir to meet the water supply demand of north china scenario 3 assumes an average annual water transfer of 13 billion m3 year due to the large increase in the water demand in north china in the future as shown in fig 7 a and table 3 under the 9 5 m3 year water transfer scenario from 2006 to 2014 for the djkr the average algae density of the qdk section and zg section would be 0 33 10 7 cells l and 0 30 10 7 cells l respectively there would be 11 algal blooms in qdk section and 10 algal blooms in zg section respectively the corresponding outbreak probabilities of algal blooms of the qdk section and zg section were 13 58 and 12 35 respectively compared with the actual water transfer conditions the number of algal blooms increased from 6 to 11 at qdk section and from 7 to 10 at zg section table 3 under the 9 5 m3 year water transfer scenario and the increased algal blooms mainly occurred from february to march the outbreak probability of algal blooms increased from 7 41 to 13 58 at the qdk section and from 8 64 to 12 35 at the zg section table 3 under the 9 5 m3 year water transfer scenario under the 13 billion m3 year water transfer scenario fig 7 b the average algae density in the qdk section and the zg section during 2006 2014 would be 0 38 10 7 cells l and 0 32 10 7 cells l respectively 15 algal blooms occurred at qdk section and 14 algal blooms will be occurred in zg section the outbreak probabilities of algal blooms of the qdk section and zg section were 18 52 and 17 28 respectively compared with the actual conditions the number of algal blooms increased from 6 to 15 at the qdk section table 3 with the outbreak probability increasing from 7 41 to 18 52 when the long term goal of diverting 13 billion m3 year from the djkr the results showed that the long term goal of diverting 13 billion m3 year by mrp of the snwdp would significantly increase the outbreak of algal blooms in the middle lower hr 4 discussion 4 1 improvement of algae growth model in the traditional wasp phytoplankton ecological dynamics models the influence of hydrodynamic process velocity water flow etc were mainly considered in the accumulation effect of mass migration and diffusion in lake water on algae while the influence of flow regime on algae growth is not directly considered in the model based on the results of labora tory and field experiments and the previous studies xia et al 2012 chen et al 2019 xia et al 2020 it was found that there is a nonlinear response relationship between the change of water level and the algae density in the lower reaches of the hr thus in our study we add the water level regulator g h in the algae growth equation to improve the algae growth module so that it could consider the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on the change of algae reproduction in addition under the influence of climate change the flow regime of river has changed dramatically across the world morales marin et al 2019 cui et al 2020 by adding the water level regulator g h in the algae growth equation also could consider the impact of climate change on the variation of flow regime modelling results show that the accuracy of the simulated algal blooms by improved algae is improved fig 6 the above approach can be used to simulate and predict the occurrence of river algal bloom in similar estuarine confluence 4 2 prediction of river algal blooms by integrated modeling approach due to the multitude and complexity of multi factors i e hydrological environmental and ecological factors in regulating river algal blooms at multi scales developing an integrated model for simulating river algal blooms faces great challenge chen 2016 zhang et al 2017 the integrated simulation provides an effective approach to assess water quantity variation water quality deterioration and water ecology variation by considering the complicated hydrological hydrodynamic ecosystem interactions and various human activities at the catchment scale compared with hydrology and water quality the process of water ecological degradation usually has a variety of features such as cumulative effects and hysteresis therefore it is difficult to use water quality indicator only to reflect water ecological problems xia et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 comparatively the integrated model provided comprehensive simulation results for hydrological water environmental and water ecological dynamics fig 4 6 in this study reflecting the changes of hydrological conditions the transport of pollutant sources in river channels and the algae growth and death however further improvements are still needed the hydrological situation between the yangtze river yr and the hr near the mouth of the lower hr is very complicated 1d hydrodynamic model may be insufficient to simulate the effects of hydrological interactions in rivers a two dimensional or three dimensional hydrodynamic model of the river can be constructed to better describe the hydrological exchange process between the yr and the hr during a bloom period in the middle lower hr and to discriminate the physical mechanism of the interaction between hydrological changes and nutrients in the hr as well as algae growth dynamics kim et al 2017 in addition due to the data availability this study does not distinguish among cyanobacteria green algae diatoms and other categories and instead makes unified calculations for algae as a whole in future research data monitoring should be strengthened to further refine the differences in the compositions and types of algae and the effects of zooplankton as an algae predator should be further considered in the algae death module although the accuracy of the proposed integrated model was acceptable in describing the hydrological water quality and water ecology variations the model performance should be further validated with more monitoring data series model uncertainty analysis should also be performed for alleviating uncertainties and improving model structures 4 3 implications for the prevention of river algal blooms in middle lower hr most river algal blooms are closely related to the construction and implementation of water conservancy projects ha 2002 with the continued operation of different conservancy projects including dams sluices and water transfer projects hydrological cycle will be significantly changed in the river basins benjamin and patrick 2012 zhang et al 2017 such effects will certainly affect the river algal blooms and provide high requirements and challenges for the ecological protection of rivers xia et al 2019 for instance previous studies have corroborated that river algal blooms have grown frequently in several tributaries of the three gorges reservoir region in china in recent years liu 2016 zheng et al 2009 algal bloom incidents have also been found in the downstream of the hr dou et al 2002 yin 2017 the middle lower hr is an important water resource for residents in major cities along the hr the river algal bloom could cause unpleasant smell and deterioration of water quality resulting in drinking water crisis for people in wuhan city based on our proposed integrated model the probability of algal bloom in the downstream of the hr caused by the reduction of water release of djkr was estimated under the design scenarios with the average annual water transfer of 9 5 billion m3 and 13 billion m3 table 3 our analysis indicates that the occurrence of algal bloom events in the downstream of the hr will increase by about two fold at the qdk section under scenario 2 9 5 billion m3 year water transfer and 2 5 fold at qdk section and two fold at zg section under scenario 3 13 billion m3 year water transfer the results show that the moderate water transfer will not significantly increase the risk of algal bloom at the zg section in the downstream of hr while when the design scenario reaches 13 billion m3 year i e the long term goal of snwdp the water flow rate is estimated to be even lower than at present which could have remarkable impacts on the occurrence of algal blooms meanwhile flushing the river with the release of djkr is also a more practical short term option for algal bloom prevention xin et al 2020 thus it is essential to implement water hydropower joint operation or build an additional water replenishing project to increase the ecological flow of hr to reduce the risk of ecological degradation and river algal blooms 5 conclusions in this study an integrated algal bloom model was developed to simulate present and future scenarios of river algal blooms affected by the large scale water transfer project in the middle lower hr the integrated model couples the distributed hydrological model the hydrodynamic model the improved phytoplankton kinetics model and reservoir operation schedule our study takes an important step forward to develop a physically based integrated model for simulating river algal blooms and effect evaluation of water transfer projects multiple datasets at different time scales including streamflow water level tn tp and algae density were applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed integrated algal bloom model the statistical indices indicate that the proposed model could provide a good simulation of water quantity water quality and river algal bloom in the middle lower hr in a changing environment the mrp of snwdp will cause runoff decreasing the occurrence of algal bloom events in the downstream of the hr will increase by about two fold under scenario 2 9 5 billion m3 year water transfer and 2 5 fold under scenario 3 13 billion m3 year water transfer at the qdk section insights have been gained from this study that large scale water transfer projects will affect the hydrological conditions for river algal blooms it is vital to highlight the necessity of implementing predictive early warning to reduce the risk of river algal blooms affected by the water transfer project this study can be also used to improve the prediction and prevention of algal blooms in large rivers worldwide credit authorship contribution statement rui xia resources data curation formal analysis methodology formal analysis writing original draft lei zou resources

24526,symbiotic associations underlie hierarchical evolutionary transitions being crucial to understanding biological complexity but which proximate triggers promote the first successful contact between guests and their hosts we tackle this problem studying the macro symbiotic model system comprised by two termite species blattodea isoptera cohabiting termitaria as a host and its obligatory inquiline we tested the hypothesis that ergonomic adjustments in resource allocation force termite colonies to trade current defence for future reproduction thence easing inquiline infiltration to do so we combined mathematical modelling and field bioassays initially we created a dynamic model to inspect colony s resource allocation as a result of the competition between a physical defence specialist caste soldiers competing for resources with a reproductive caste alates and with a physical resource gatherer specialist caste workers this model differs from oster wilson s bang bang model by the explicit inclusion of solders as a physical defence specialist then we sought empirical support for the end results of our model i censusing the population and ii measuring the patrolling efforts by soldiers in 154 mature field termite colonies along a year long reproductive season finally we verified in the field whether reproducing termite colonies would be more likely to house inquilines than colonies still not at reproductive stage modelling and field results matched closely supporting our hypothesis inquiline termites inquilinitermes microcerus sneaked into nests of host termites constrictotermes cyphergaster as these latter colonies undergone a defence reproduction tradeoff as the host colony entered reproduction their soldier numbers and patrolling waned enhancing the proneness of infiltration by obligatory inquilines our results indicate that defence reproduction tradeoffs more than a strategy to optimise resource use can be important initiators of symbioses by loosening self non self discrimination and enhancing tolerance we speculate that if changes in the internal stasis of an organism or superorganism can enhance tolerance it could be invoked to explain why symbioses are frequently enhanced by stress and disturbance graphical abstract keywords empirically supported modelling inquiline symbiosis termitophile data availability data will be made available at https zenodo org communities termitology 1 introduction long term and intimate associations between different organisms or symbioses sensu de bary see oulhen et al 2016 pervade life and underlie hierarchical evolutionary transitions being paramount to unveil the building up of biological complexity but why do distinct organisms renounce their individual autonomy to stay together estrela et al 2016 why do different individuals from distinct species bind together in permanent host parasite host commensal or mutualistic alliances the ultimate answer to these questions is straightforward organisms link together when it pays off in ecological and evolutionary terms but what is the proximate answer which triggers promote the first successful contact between guests and hosts thence originating the symbiotic association or in the words of van gestel and tarnita 2017 how does a group initiate that has the potential to undergo hierarchical evolutionary transition here we tackle such a problem focusing on the macro symbiotic model system comprised by two distinct termite species blattodea isoptera in such a system most termitaria built by the host constrictotermes cyphergaster bear the inquiline termite species inquilinitermes microcerus as an obligatory cohabitant using mathematical modelling combined with field assays we inspect the crucial moment when host and inquilines come together aiming to establish the catalyst of such a cohabitation termite inquilinism or the heterospecific termite termite cohabitation provides a valuable model system to study mechanisms of symbiotic initiation as at least for the case above we know the precise moment when the inquiline enters its host nest cristaldo et al 2012 nevertheless the mechanisms of host infiltration remain largely unveiled previously spotted patterns provide some hints though it has been shown for instance that as the nest volume increases i inquilines become more prevalent cristaldo et al 2012 marins et al 2016 while ii termite patrollers become less active desouza et al 2016 it seems hence consequential to suspect that inquilines are more likely to occur in bigger nests as there active defence i e soldier patrolling tends to wane this sounds plausible because bigger nests being generally older should bear colonies mature enough to have entered reproduction nutting 1969 1979 having a prior claim on resource allocation and being energetically costly reproduction should tip the colony s energy balance demanding resources previously invested in other functions levins 1968 oster and wilson 1978 stearns 1989 de jong and van noordwijk 1992 stearns 1992 at this point active defence by patrollers would be demoted to lower priority after all soldiers are a costly and dispensable caste noirot and darlington 2000 moreover bigger nests being presumably older should bear walls which got thicker and cured over time making it possible to swap active for passive defence it follows that the correlations found by cristaldo et al 2012 and 11 would be related to the host colony reaching maturation and entering a reproductive stage rather than connected to the sheer physical size of the nest as indeed postulated by these latter authors this leads to the hypothesis to be tested here bigger nests being mature divert energy inputs to reproduction at the expense of defence thereby easing invasion by inquilines to test this hypothesis two big issues demand scrutiny firstly would ergonomic adjustments in resource allocation force termite colonies to trade current defence for future reproduction next if this is shown likely would such a tradeoff allow inquilines settlement in these colonies to deal with these issues here we combine mathematical modelling and field bioassays initially we model the production of alates at the expense of soldiers using a simple bang bang model sensu oster and wilson 1978 modified to include a physical defence specialist caste soldiers which competes for resources with a reproductive caste alates and with a physical resource gatherer specialist caste workers we then seek qualitative support for the end results of our model i censusing the size of the population of soldiers and ii measuring the patrolling efforts by such soldiers in mature field colonies of c cyphergaster along a full reproductive season before releasing of alates at their releasing period and after it finally we tackle the last and crucial issue again using field data to verify whether reproducing termite colonies would be more likely to house inquiline termites when compared to colonies still not at reproductive stage 2 material and methods 2 1 terms definition we take symbiosis in de bary s sense the living together of unlike organisms oulhen et al 2016 regardless whether they interact in a positive or negative way cohabitation coexistence and inquilinism are utilised as forms of symbioses referring to the simultaneous occurrence of two different termite species in the same nest cohabitants are the host or builder termite and the inquiline or guest termite sharing a nest obligatory inquilines are unable to build their own nest a nest or termitarium plural termitaria is the physical structure built by the host termite a colony is a monospecific group of mutually interacting termites termites are monophyletic eusocial cockroaches blattodea krishna et al 2013 whose colony is composed of sterile and reproductive individuals wilson 1971 which normally comprise castes distinct in morphology and function sterile castes are composed of workers housekeeping specialists and soldiers defence specialists the reproductive caste is composed of the royal couple king and queen and their fertile offspring these latter are siblings to the steriles being eventually released to found a new colony elsewhere reproductive individuals possess functional or budding wings being here referred to as young reproductives sexuals alates or nymphs indistinguishably 2 2 overall rationale our study encompasses two steps we firstly built an abstract idealistic and deterministic model simulating only the dynamics concerning our hypothesis to do so we used a modification of the mathematical bang bang model for the reproductive strategy of social insects colonies oster and wilson 1978 in our idealistic model the termite host colony undergoes an energy tradeoff along one full reproductive cycle swapping the production of workers and soldiers colony growth for the production of alates colony reproduction because workers and soldiers protect the nest from invasion this swapping should create a window of opportunity for interlopers after running the model and effectively observing this theoretical window of opportunity we censused 154 colonies to confirm whether this swapping between a working protective caste and a reproductive caste would be observed under the probabilistic scenario of an year long full reproductive cycle in the field when opting for a deterministic modelling approach we intended to strictly simulate our prediction that a tradeoff between growth and reproduction of the host colony could underlie inquiline invasion in termitaria if we added uncertainty and noise in our model we would not strictly build our prediction and that would obscure the test of our hypothesis uncertainty and noise on the other hand are let to dictate deviations in our field data in doing so we were able to confront a purely abstract model the ideal world with the probabilistic reality of the field data our argument is solid precisely due to that the results of our idealistic model were shown to correspond to the results of the noisy and uncertain field data 2 3 modelling in the original bang bang model the investment in castes happens in phases interspersed by two bangs an ergonomic phase where the colony invests all resources in growing workers and ii a reproductive phase where all resources are directed to the production of sexuals our modification of this model fig 1 includes soldiers as a physical defence specialist caste expliciting this caste in the model is relevant because in isoptera as opposed to other social insects soldiers are trophically dependent on the workers being hence an important resource drain in our model resources brought to the colony by workers are allocated to the production of new workers soldiers and sexuals alates or nymphs in the first bang resources are allocated to workers and soldiers in the second bang sexuals compete directly with soldiers for the share of resources originally allocated to these latter simultaneously soldiers provide defence to the colony reducing mortality of workers and alates soldiers hence enhance the productivity of the colony sexuals on their turn are simply resource drains showing no immediate return to their mother colony of course sexuals contribute directly to the fitness of the members of the colony but this is beyond the scope of our model it is worth clarifying that the castes inside a termite nest do indeed cooperate in ecological terms to keep their colony functioning and that is the essence of social behaviour however in physiological terms they also compete because when a given egg develops say into a worker it is essentially diverting a share of the available energy to this caste rather than to any other providing that the total amount of energy available to the colony is limited the subpopulation of each caste compete among themselves for shares of this energy that is the sense under which we say that soldiers compete with workers and alates for simplicity and in the absence of detail on the ontogeny of c cyphergaster colonies in cerrado biome our model depicts a qualitative picture of the first stages of a colony s ontogeny from founding to first swarm focusing on these stages sounds appropriate because we model the ontogenic precursors of invasions by an obligatory inquiline that after succeeding invasion becomes the sole permanent inquiline in a colony it is also worth considering that despite knowing that i microcerus invades c cyphergaster when nests attain 12 l cristaldo et al 2012 we do not know how long it takes for such nests to attain this size in cerrado the time figures here used therefore should be taken relatively rather than absolutely i e time steps rather than proper days 2 3 1 the dynamics of the termite colony having the above constraints in mind a termite colony dynamics can be described as follows after leaving their natal nests finding a partner and founding a new colony the royal couple begins the production of sterile individuals soldiers and workers see above for the colony growth this ergonomic period oster and wilson 1978 ends with the first bang after reaching an adequate size having accumulated sufficient resources and individuals the colony enters the reproductive period the colony invests resources in the production of fertile individuals the alates which will fly away to found new colonies the beginning of the flight season characterises the second bang just after the flight the colony is depleted of resources and lacks enough workers to forage for replenishment sterile individuals naturally dying are not replaced until the colony is able to resume a new cycle in summary our model comprises i the ergonomic phase starting at 0 time steps ts and ending with the first bang at 160 ts ii the reproductive phase starting at 160 ts and ending with the second bang at about 190 ts and iii the flight phase starting at 190 ts and ending at about 350 time steps 2 3 2 model description the model considers that the termite population composing a colony c comprises three different castes subpopulations the workers w the soldiers s and winged reproductives or sexuals r the number of individuals in each of these castes varies in time t therefore we consider w t the number of workers in the instant t s t the number of soldiers in the instant t r t the number of winged reproductives sexuals in the instant t thus the total population in the time t is given by 1 c t w t s t r t the resources are assumed to be abundant upon acquisition by the colony the resources are allocated differentially to the production of castes throughout the cycle in the ergonomic period colony growth resources are directed to the production of sterile individuals workers and soldiers whereas in the reproductive period the resources are directed to the production reproductive nestmates at the expense of the steriles in our model fig 1 the total amount of available resources γ is diverted to the production of new workers soldiers and sexuals the workers receive a fraction 1 u of these resources while the soldiers and alates receive u the resource amount represented by this latter quantity in turn is split among alates and soldiers while alates receive a fraction 1 a of u soldiers receive a the quantity a is dependent on the colony being at the ergonomic or at the reproductive stage in such a way that at the ergonomic stage a 1 and 1 a 0 that is no investment is made on sexuals at the reproductive stage soldiers receive a lessened share of resources a 1 so that sexuals can receive some share of it 1 a 0 the birth of workers w soldiers s and alates r resulting from such investments is counteracted respectively by mortality rates μ w μ s and μ r final mortality rates of workers and sexuals however are reduced by the protection p offered by the soldiers the number of individuals in each caste at a given time w t s t and r t can be thus described by the coupled system of ordinary differential equations 2 w 1 u t γ t w t μ w w t p s u t a t γ t w t μ s s t r 1 a t u t γ t w t μ r r t p where represents differentiation in time d d t e g d s d t s the amount of resources γ available for colony growth depends on the difference between the amount collected 3 γ 0 1 tanh k s t w t r t and the consumption of these resources by individuals at rate α is 4 α 1 tanh k s t w t r t where 5 tanh k s t w t r t makes resource gathering and consumption dependent on the proportion of soldiers s relative to the total numbers of workers w plus alates r increasing the value of the ratio s w r means that i workers are better in collecting resources because there is more protection from soldiers whereas ii there are stronger drains on these resources as soldiers are trophically dependent on workers since either the benefit or the cost of soldiers does not grow forever such a limit is set by tanh whose steepness is regulated by k the total amount of resources γ at any given time is hence 6 γ γ 0 α w t 1 tanh k s t w t r t this will of course depend on the mortality rates of each caste which in turn is affected see eq 2 by the protection p provided by soldiers 7 p 1 tanh k s t w t r t as each caste has a different dynamics we consider distinct mortality rates μ w μ s and μ r for workers soldiers and alates respectively 2 3 3 running the model since we have modified the original bang bang model to include an additional physical sterile caste soldiers which competes for resources directly with alates it seemed advisable to include an extra bang in the model as well therefore our running of this model comprises three phases as detailed below see also eq 2 and fig 1 phase 1 before the first bang at this point only workers and soldiers are produced hence a 1 no investment on alates and the numbers of workers w soldiers s and alates r satisfy while γ and p obey eqs 6 and 7 respectively phase 2 after the first and before the second bang at this point the investment on alates begins and soldiers receive a smaller share of resources a 1 the number of individuals is hence w 1 u t γ t w t μ w w t p s u t a t γ t w t μ s s t r 1 a t u t γ t w t μ r r t p phase 3 after the second bang now the model is fully in the reproductive stage and the investment on workers goes to zero 1 u 0 it follows that the number of individuals is explained by 2 3 4 parametrisation all parameters used in these equations are summarised at table 1 parameters have been chosen arbitrarily so that we could properly simulate our hypothesis after all the whole idea was to simulate an ideal abstract model and look for any real world field evidence of such a dynamics see section overall rationale above gamma zero production capacity is higher than alpha consumption rate to make sure that the colony produces always more than what it consumes at any cycle this is probably biologically true for a colony in good shape and guarantees our premise the castes compete for resources that are limited the actual values are chosen within a range to avoid saturations in other words we set them in a range to be able to observe the model s dynamics when the variables s t w t and r t change over time obviously if gamma zero is huge compared to alpha it does not matter how the colony allocate resources because there are so many resources that the colony can do what it wants and no competition dynamics is installed among castes the same is true if alpha is too small compared to gamma zero so this values are chosen to be able to observe the effects induced by the variations of the model s variables based on the assumptions the same happens for the mortality rates the actual numbers were chosen in a way to avoid saturation effects if these rates are too high there is no dynamics to be observed the overall logic is also dictated by our previous observations that soldiers die at a higher rate than worker and reproductives the parameter t has no biological meaning it has been chosen long enough to allow the whole model dynamics predicted in our hypothesis the parameters k does not have any significant effects since it is set to 1 it could be removed but we decided to let it in the model to allow its use in case someone would intend to vary the steepness of the curve generated by t a n g h to see how this influence the model dynamics so to conclude there is an overall logic dictated by biological evidence in the relative magnitude that each parameter holds compared to all the others however the actual values have no biological meaning they were chosen in a range to be able to observe the model dynamics without facing saturation effects 2 4 empirical tests empirical tests were carried out to verify i whether a tradeoff between nest defence and reproduction could be observed in field colonies as predicted by the model and ii whether we could find evidence for a correlation between such a tradeoff and a propensity for the termite colony to be invaded by inquilines note that we are not explicitly or manipulatively testing every step in our dynamic model rather we are simply checking whether field colonies observed along a full reproductive cycle would present populational parameters as predicted by our model a total of 154 c cyphergaster nests have been used to generate field data as detailed below specimens collected from these nests to confirm the identity of the cohabiting termites were stored in 80 alcohol labelled and identified according to mathews 1977 and constantino 2002 later the identifications were confirmed by comparison with the samples deposited at isoptera section of the museum of entomology at the federal university of viçosa 2 4 1 the focal species we have chosen as a model host guest pair of species the host termite c cyphergaster termitidae nasutitermitinae and its obligatory inquiline i microcerus termitidae termitinae this host termite is commonly found in brazil paraguay bolivia and argentina where it is known to produce workers and soldiers throughout the year while concentrating its alates release just before the rainy season cunha and brandão 2002 moura et al 2006 their arboreal nest s earthen walls are initially crumbly but tend to get thicker and harder with nest age as the nest grows older it grows in volume nests house different invertebrate cohabitants but only one of two species of obligatory inquilines are common i microcerus and inquilinitermes fur termitidae termitinae i microcerus are more likely to establish themselves in these host nests after they attain 12 litters cristaldo et al 2012 and once established they keep themselves restricted to certain regions of the nest cunha et al 2003 as if avoiding to be detected by the builder in addition this inquiline seems to prevent contacts and hence conflicts with their hosts feeding on a distinct diet florencio et al 2013 and decoding and avoiding hosts trail and alarm cues cristaldo et al 2014 2016 we always selected nests from a continuous range of volume because nest size is a relevant factor for cohabitation cristaldo et al 2012 nest volume estimation is detailed in the supporting information 2 4 2 study area the study was conducted in the brazilian cerrado biome an environment physiognomically but not floristically similar to a savannah in the municipalities of sete lagoas 19 27 57 s 44 14 49 w and divinópolis 20 08 20 s 44 53 02 w in minas gerais state brazil the area comprising both localities is subjected to aw climate equatorial with dry winter according with the köppen s classification kottek et al 2006 in sete lagoas bioassays were conducted in july 2007 when the total precipitation was 6 6 mm the relative humidity average was 54 4 and the average temperature was 17 2 c in divinópolis bioassays were conducted in 2015 in the months of january total rainfall 63 5 mm relative humidity average 49 6 average temperature 25 2 c july total rainfall 12 2 mm relative humidity average 64 3 average temperature 19 7 c and november total rainfall 134 5 mm relative humidity average 68 35 average temperature 25 0 c instituto nacional de meteorologia 2016 2 4 3 the match between model and empirical data to examine the existence of an analytical and empirical match we inspected whether termite field colonies would trade defence for reproduction as predicted by our hypothesis and dissected by the model to tackle this issue we considered that while the soldier contingent can be a surrogate for the colony s defence investment the presence of alate individuals including nymphs in a nest would announce that the colony has entered a reproductive stage we hence inspected in the field whether the presence of host alates in a colony would correlate negatively with the percentage of host soldiers relative to the total host population in that colony workers soldiers alates however even diminishing the proportion of soldiers a colony could still keep the same defence level providing the remaining soldiers became more active in patrolling the nest desouza et al 2016 to account for this effect we performed an additional bioassay in the field testing whether soldier patrolling would be negatively affected by the presence of alates in the colonies the population numbers and composition in a termite colony fluctuates naturally along its annual reproductive cycle nutting 1969 martius and ribeiro 1996 lepage and darlington 2002 if for no reason other than due to the release of alates in the swarming season to account for this we performed the above tests before during and after the flight season to account for populational fluctuations not associated to the swarm itself we inspected reproducing and non reproducing colonies in the cerrado biome where experiments have been carried out these periods correspond instituto nacional de meteorologia 2016 respectively to the peak of the dry season in the winter july the beginning of the rainy season in the spring november and the mid rainy season in the summer january percentage of soldiers to verify whether the presence of alates would affect the percentage of soldiers in the colony we performed a complete census of 25 c cyphergaster nests in 2015 10 nests in january eight in july and seven in november in divinópolis to do so nests of varying volumes were selected in the field and taken to laboratory where they were broken into pieces and all visible individuals were collected with tweezers and stored in 80 alcohol then the nest fragments were passed through series of stainless steel sieves with openings of 4 75 2 00 1 00 and 0 50 mm capturing termites eventually found after that nest fragments were placed under a 100 watts incandescent lamp in berlese funnels over a receptacle containing 80 alcohol after two days the receptacle was sifted to extract all termites therein fallen this whole setup was enclosed in a cage of muslin to prevent termite alates to escape by flying soldier patrolling in order to verify the patrolling activity of soldiers we carried out a field assay obeying the same procedures of desouza et al 2016 an experimental disturbance was inflicted on the nest wall and the number of individuals attending this disturbance was tallied up such a physical disturbance was made to a point located halfway between the nest s base and top using the stainless steel blade of a pocket knife to jab the nest on its exterior wall forming a 3 5 1 cm length diameter cylindrical hole this blade was always cleaned with 70 ethanol before each trial a wooden stick c a 20 0 5 cm length diameter was immediately and partially inserted into this hole for 40 s after which clinging worker and soldier termites were shaken into a plastic tray held right below the stick for each trial a new stick was used termites were collected from the tray stored and identified as described above all tests have been conducted directly at nests in their normal state still attached to the trees in the field a total of 81 c cyphergaster nests of varying volumes have been assayed 35 of which in january 19 in july and 21 in november 2015 in divinópolis 2 4 4 would inquilines settlement correlate to host colony reproduction to inspect the above issue we have taken 37 nests of c cyphergaster from the field estimated their volume and broke them apart in the lab in search of i microcerus inquilines as well as host s alates this bioassay took place in july 2007 pre flight season in sete lagoas 2 5 statistical analysis empirical data were analysed in a threefold procedure firstly we inspected whether the percentage of soldiers relative to the total population of the host a continuous binomial yvar would be affected by the presence of young host alates a categorical xvar in the nest modelling proceeded under binomial errors then we inspected whether the patrolling activity of soldiers a continuous yvar would be affected by the presence of young host alates in the nest patrolling activity was defined as the number of soldiers attending a physical disturbance on the nest wall see details above modelling proceeded under quasipoisson errors to correct for overdispersion detected in a first try with poisson errors the full model in both cases included nest volume and seasonality pre flight flight and post flight periods as covariates finally we inspected whether the presence of inquilines binary yvar 0 absence 1 presence in the host nest was affected by the presence of host alates categorical xvar modelling proceeded by logistic regression under binomial errors the full model included nest volume as a covariate all data in this case refer to a single season pre flight the data were analysed under generalised linear models glm followed by residual analyses to check the suitability of the errors distribution and the adjustment of the model crawley 2007 model simplification was performed using the akaike information criterion aic and second order aic aicc as well as the qaic or qaicc for over dispersed data burnham and anderson 2002 the best model was defined as the one presenting the lowest δ a i c value and highest weight the analyses were performed in r development core team 2016 with the package mumin barton 2015 3 results 3 1 modelling as depicted in fig 2 our theoretical model predicts the numbers of workers and soldiers to build up during the ergonomic phase and to drop steadily in the reproductive phase right after the alates start to be produced the number of alates thus is negatively correlated to the number of soldiers and incidentally that of workers composing a given colony at any given time after alates are released in their nuptial flight the model keeps predicting strong decrements in the colony population 3 2 empirical tests 3 2 1 soldier proportions young host reproductives the corrected volumes for the 24 c cyphergaster nests used in this field assay ranged from 3 4 to 37 litres with a mean of 13 3 litres supporting predictions from the theoretical model the proportion of host soldiers correlated negatively with the presence of host alates in the nests but it was not affected by the season or by the nest volume table 2 fig 3 the minimum adequate statistical model thereby achieved predicts the proportion of soldiers to vary as 8 log e p q 1 1358 1 029 r e p r where p q or p r o p s in table 2 is the ratio of the number of host soldiers to total population in a nest and r e p r is a binary variable describing the presence r e p r 1 or the absence r e p r 0 of young host reproductives in that nest 3 2 2 patrolling behaviour young host reproductives the corrected volumes for the 81 c cyphergaster nests used in this field assay ranged from 3 9 to 47 litres with a mean of 15 7 litres the number of host soldiers attending the experimental disturbance on the nest wall i e patrolling by soldiers after the first 40 s had elapsed ranged from 0 to 49 with an mean of 9 2 again supporting predictions from the theoretical model patrolling by host soldiers was depressed by the presence of alates in the nest and as the seasons proceeded from pre flight flight to post flight table 2 fig 4 the minimum adequate model thereby achieved predicts the number of patrolling soldiers to vary as 9 log e p a t r o l s 1 8011 0 4533 r e p r s e a s o n where p a t r o l s is the number of patrolling soldiers attending the experimental disturbance on the nest wall r e p r is a binary variable describing the presence r e p r 1 or the absence r e p r 0 of host winged reproductives in that nest and s e a s o n is a variable describing distinct periods of the host reproductive cycle replacing estimates for this variable accordingly one can get the respective model for post flight s e a s o n 0 pre flight s e a s o n 0 9530 and flight s e a s o n 0 9421 3 2 3 inquilinism young host reproductives the corrected volumes for the 37 c cyphergaster nests used in this field assay ranged from 3 4 to 34 7 litres with a mean of 13 1 litres the totality of the 19 nests containing host alates also housed i microcerus inquilines among the other 18 nests void of alates only six housed inquilines the prevalence of inquilinism in these nests was therefore 19 6 37 0 675 or 67 5 supporting our hypothesis the presence of host alates in c cyphergaster nests strongly enhanced the chances of finding inquilines therein fig 5 this was so evident that inquilines where found even in small nests volume 12 l as long as host alates where also present nests as small as those are normally predicted to not house inquilines cristaldo et al 2012 conversely and in accordance with this previous work in the absence of winged reproductives only after attaining around 12 l did the nest house inquilines fig 5 among all candidate statistical models the one holding these two factors winged reproductives and nest size was appointed by the model selection procedure as the best model table 2 fig 5 according to this model the likelihood of housing inquilines could be explained by 10 log e p q 5 4372 0 4823 v o l 18 8643 r e p r where p q or i n q in table 2 is the odds ratio of housing not housing an inquiline colony v o l is the host nest volume in litres and r e p r is a binary variable representing the presence r e p r 1 or the absence r e p r 0 of host winged reproductives in that nest 4 discussion the moment when potential symbioses initiate and the mechanism behind it are normally viewed as a failure in the self non self discriminating system immune system hereafter while this seems indeed the case of parasitic symbioses it would not closely fit mutualistic and perhaps commensal associations a more encompassing concept would state that the immune system functions as a passport control agent or a bouncer as opposed to a barrier intended to keep the host pure gilbert 2014 that is interlopers are allowed in or barred based on the host s evolutionary experience about their potential danger matzinger 1994 successful intruders in this context would be those presenting low risk relative to the cost of being barred by the host this seems to explain why a single inquiline genus inquilinitermes is reported to compose the termite termite macros symbiosis here described being refractory to inquilines other than i fur and i microcerus colonies of c cyphergaster seem to be able to perform such a selective access control in its turn the host specialists inquilinitermes spp being obligatory inquilines seem to possess the ability to detect the precise moments of favourable resistance tolerance gatekeeping in its host that is these inquilines would profit from a window of opportunity to infiltrate simultaneously these inquilines present strategies to go unnoticed in their host colony cristaldo et al 2014 hugo et al 2020 indeed our results support the hypothesis that inquiline termites can sneak into their host termite colonies as these latter undergo a defence reproduction tradeoff this would endorse the idea that the symbiotic link between i microcerus termites and their termite hosts c cyphergaster can be elicited by a window of opportunity in which self non self discrimination is loosened desouza et al 2016 the following lines of evidence allow such a statement first this tradeoff was shown to happen in modelled termite colonies when a physical defence specialist caste soldiers competed for resources with a reproductive caste alates and with a physical resource gatherer specialist caste workers figs 1 and 2 in such a model soldiers are traded for alates as the colony maturates and this closely resembles our field data indeed in c cyphergaster termites field colonies which entered reproduction held a population depleted of soldiers fig 3 tables 2 and 3 working with amazonian termites pequeno and franklin 2018 also found evidence for a tradeoff between colony investment in soldiers reproduction diminished soldier numbers would not necessarily lead to weakened defence as the individual working load could be enhanced to compensate lowered contingent however in a manipulative field assay we could confirm that this tradeoff did affect defence not only a significant diminution in soldier patrolling rate was observed in reproducing colonies fig 4 tables 2 and 3 but also inquilines were more likely to be found in these colonies fig 5 this shift from intolerance to tolerance easing symbioses has been previously reported to depend on ontogenetic changes in some hosts in the same termite host guest pair here studied rodrigues et al 2018 and cristaldo et al 2012 reported a higher prevalence of inquilines in older colonies of the host c cyphergaster indicating that younger colonies are less tolerant to invasion similarly mature phase galls induced by the aphid tamalia coweni support higher numbers of inquiline aphids t inquilinus than do early or trophic phase galls miller iii and crespi 2003 ontogenetic change is also reported to guide tolerance to cleaning annelids by their crayfish partners skelton et al 2014 as with our termite colonies younger and smaller crayfish are less tolerant because they present more effective patrolling apparatus than older and larger ones in the case of termite colonies this patrolling is performed by the soldier contingent which is less tolerant in smaller younger than in larger older nests as for crayfish patrolling is done by the dactyls of their walking legs which can reach larger areas of the carapace of the intolerant youngsters similar tolerance associated to morphological changes dependent on ontogeny was reported by dunlap et al 2012 for sea urchin cardinalfish and their symbiotic luminous bacteria in this system infection occur only after the host s light organ undergoes initial development hypothetical mechanism in the termite colonies here studied the ontogenetic change leading to the acceptance of inquilines was shown to occur at the onset of the host s reproductive phase fig 5 a similar shift towards tolerance at the reproductive phase has been reported for sceloporus occidentalis squamata phrynosomatidae lizards whose pregnant females bear more ticks than nonpregnant ones pollock et al 2012 but what are the likely mechanisms behind this tradeoff in termites why is it even possible a likely hypothesis might state that this is merely a consequence of the normal ontogeny of the termite host colony as the number of soldiers builds up in a growing colony the titres of juvenile hormone jh rapidly decreases in larvae as a consequence of increments in the amount of primer pheromones produced by the soldiers themselves lefeuve and bordereau 1984 tian and zhou 2014 this would divert the differentiation of these youngsters to alates rather than additional presoldiers henderson 1998 mao et al 2005 park and raina 2005 watanabe et al 2011 2014 korb 2015 when this production of alates claims excessive numbers of young larvae it also impacts negatively the number of workers the primary food gathering caste of the colony this would lead to food shortage in the colony which in turn reestablishes high rates of jh synthesis in larvae recovering soldier production and closing the window of opportunity for invasion by inquilines albeit not aimed at testing this hypothesis our data bring at least two precursors to it i our model predicts a peak in soldier production right before the flight period fig 2 and ii the percentage of soldiers in the nest population was significantly higher in field colonies from which winged reproductives were absent fig 3 accordingly lucena et al 2019 observed a drop in the number of workers conjugated with increments in the number of soldiers right after the release of alates in colonies of this same host termite c cyphergaster in the caatinga semiarid region of northeastern brazil 4 1 conclusion we show that defence reproduction tradeoffs more than a strategy to optimise resource use can be important initiators of symbioses if changes in the internal stasis of an organism or a superorganism hölldobler and wilson 2008 can loosen self non self discrimination enhancing tolerance it could be invoked to explain i why stress and disturbance are important drivers of symbioses seckbach and grube 2010 monteiro et al 2017 and of species coexistence bertness and callaway 1994 solar et al 2015 and ii why interindividual communication is eased in stressful contexts miramontes and desouza 1996 desouza et al 2001 clearly these are mere speculations which although not

24526,symbiotic associations underlie hierarchical evolutionary transitions being crucial to understanding biological complexity but which proximate triggers promote the first successful contact between guests and their hosts we tackle this problem studying the macro symbiotic model system comprised by two termite species blattodea isoptera cohabiting termitaria as a host and its obligatory inquiline we tested the hypothesis that ergonomic adjustments in resource allocation force termite colonies to trade current defence for future reproduction thence easing inquiline infiltration to do so we combined mathematical modelling and field bioassays initially we created a dynamic model to inspect colony s resource allocation as a result of the competition between a physical defence specialist caste soldiers competing for resources with a reproductive caste alates and with a physical resource gatherer specialist caste workers this model differs from oster wilson s bang bang model by the explicit inclusion of solders as a physical defence specialist then we sought empirical support for the end results of our model i censusing the population and ii measuring the patrolling efforts by soldiers in 154 mature field termite colonies along a year long reproductive season finally we verified in the field whether reproducing termite colonies would be more likely to house inquilines than colonies still not at reproductive stage modelling and field results matched closely supporting our hypothesis inquiline termites inquilinitermes microcerus sneaked into nests of host termites constrictotermes cyphergaster as these latter colonies undergone a defence reproduction tradeoff as the host colony entered reproduction their soldier numbers and patrolling waned enhancing the proneness of infiltration by obligatory inquilines our results indicate that defence reproduction tradeoffs more than a strategy to optimise resource use can be important initiators of symbioses by loosening self non self discrimination and enhancing tolerance we speculate that if changes in the internal stasis of an organism or superorganism can enhance tolerance it could be invoked to explain why symbioses are frequently enhanced by stress and disturbance graphical abstract keywords empirically supported modelling inquiline symbiosis termitophile data availability data will be made available at https zenodo org communities termitology 1 introduction long term and intimate associations between different organisms or symbioses sensu de bary see oulhen et al 2016 pervade life and underlie hierarchical evolutionary transitions being paramount to unveil the building up of biological complexity but why do distinct organisms renounce their individual autonomy to stay together estrela et al 2016 why do different individuals from distinct species bind together in permanent host parasite host commensal or mutualistic alliances the ultimate answer to these questions is straightforward organisms link together when it pays off in ecological and evolutionary terms but what is the proximate answer which triggers promote the first successful contact between guests and hosts thence originating the symbiotic association or in the words of van gestel and tarnita 2017 how does a group initiate that has the potential to undergo hierarchical evolutionary transition here we tackle such a problem focusing on the macro symbiotic model system comprised by two distinct termite species blattodea isoptera in such a system most termitaria built by the host constrictotermes cyphergaster bear the inquiline termite species inquilinitermes microcerus as an obligatory cohabitant using mathematical modelling combined with field assays we inspect the crucial moment when host and inquilines come together aiming to establish the catalyst of such a cohabitation termite inquilinism or the heterospecific termite termite cohabitation provides a valuable model system to study mechanisms of symbiotic initiation as at least for the case above we know the precise moment when the inquiline enters its host nest cristaldo et al 2012 nevertheless the mechanisms of host infiltration remain largely unveiled previously spotted patterns provide some hints though it has been shown for instance that as the nest volume increases i inquilines become more prevalent cristaldo et al 2012 marins et al 2016 while ii termite patrollers become less active desouza et al 2016 it seems hence consequential to suspect that inquilines are more likely to occur in bigger nests as there active defence i e soldier patrolling tends to wane this sounds plausible because bigger nests being generally older should bear colonies mature enough to have entered reproduction nutting 1969 1979 having a prior claim on resource allocation and being energetically costly reproduction should tip the colony s energy balance demanding resources previously invested in other functions levins 1968 oster and wilson 1978 stearns 1989 de jong and van noordwijk 1992 stearns 1992 at this point active defence by patrollers would be demoted to lower priority after all soldiers are a costly and dispensable caste noirot and darlington 2000 moreover bigger nests being presumably older should bear walls which got thicker and cured over time making it possible to swap active for passive defence it follows that the correlations found by cristaldo et al 2012 and 11 would be related to the host colony reaching maturation and entering a reproductive stage rather than connected to the sheer physical size of the nest as indeed postulated by these latter authors this leads to the hypothesis to be tested here bigger nests being mature divert energy inputs to reproduction at the expense of defence thereby easing invasion by inquilines to test this hypothesis two big issues demand scrutiny firstly would ergonomic adjustments in resource allocation force termite colonies to trade current defence for future reproduction next if this is shown likely would such a tradeoff allow inquilines settlement in these colonies to deal with these issues here we combine mathematical modelling and field bioassays initially we model the production of alates at the expense of soldiers using a simple bang bang model sensu oster and wilson 1978 modified to include a physical defence specialist caste soldiers which competes for resources with a reproductive caste alates and with a physical resource gatherer specialist caste workers we then seek qualitative support for the end results of our model i censusing the size of the population of soldiers and ii measuring the patrolling efforts by such soldiers in mature field colonies of c cyphergaster along a full reproductive season before releasing of alates at their releasing period and after it finally we tackle the last and crucial issue again using field data to verify whether reproducing termite colonies would be more likely to house inquiline termites when compared to colonies still not at reproductive stage 2 material and methods 2 1 terms definition we take symbiosis in de bary s sense the living together of unlike organisms oulhen et al 2016 regardless whether they interact in a positive or negative way cohabitation coexistence and inquilinism are utilised as forms of symbioses referring to the simultaneous occurrence of two different termite species in the same nest cohabitants are the host or builder termite and the inquiline or guest termite sharing a nest obligatory inquilines are unable to build their own nest a nest or termitarium plural termitaria is the physical structure built by the host termite a colony is a monospecific group of mutually interacting termites termites are monophyletic eusocial cockroaches blattodea krishna et al 2013 whose colony is composed of sterile and reproductive individuals wilson 1971 which normally comprise castes distinct in morphology and function sterile castes are composed of workers housekeeping specialists and soldiers defence specialists the reproductive caste is composed of the royal couple king and queen and their fertile offspring these latter are siblings to the steriles being eventually released to found a new colony elsewhere reproductive individuals possess functional or budding wings being here referred to as young reproductives sexuals alates or nymphs indistinguishably 2 2 overall rationale our study encompasses two steps we firstly built an abstract idealistic and deterministic model simulating only the dynamics concerning our hypothesis to do so we used a modification of the mathematical bang bang model for the reproductive strategy of social insects colonies oster and wilson 1978 in our idealistic model the termite host colony undergoes an energy tradeoff along one full reproductive cycle swapping the production of workers and soldiers colony growth for the production of alates colony reproduction because workers and soldiers protect the nest from invasion this swapping should create a window of opportunity for interlopers after running the model and effectively observing this theoretical window of opportunity we censused 154 colonies to confirm whether this swapping between a working protective caste and a reproductive caste would be observed under the probabilistic scenario of an year long full reproductive cycle in the field when opting for a deterministic modelling approach we intended to strictly simulate our prediction that a tradeoff between growth and reproduction of the host colony could underlie inquiline invasion in termitaria if we added uncertainty and noise in our model we would not strictly build our prediction and that would obscure the test of our hypothesis uncertainty and noise on the other hand are let to dictate deviations in our field data in doing so we were able to confront a purely abstract model the ideal world with the probabilistic reality of the field data our argument is solid precisely due to that the results of our idealistic model were shown to correspond to the results of the noisy and uncertain field data 2 3 modelling in the original bang bang model the investment in castes happens in phases interspersed by two bangs an ergonomic phase where the colony invests all resources in growing workers and ii a reproductive phase where all resources are directed to the production of sexuals our modification of this model fig 1 includes soldiers as a physical defence specialist caste expliciting this caste in the model is relevant because in isoptera as opposed to other social insects soldiers are trophically dependent on the workers being hence an important resource drain in our model resources brought to the colony by workers are allocated to the production of new workers soldiers and sexuals alates or nymphs in the first bang resources are allocated to workers and soldiers in the second bang sexuals compete directly with soldiers for the share of resources originally allocated to these latter simultaneously soldiers provide defence to the colony reducing mortality of workers and alates soldiers hence enhance the productivity of the colony sexuals on their turn are simply resource drains showing no immediate return to their mother colony of course sexuals contribute directly to the fitness of the members of the colony but this is beyond the scope of our model it is worth clarifying that the castes inside a termite nest do indeed cooperate in ecological terms to keep their colony functioning and that is the essence of social behaviour however in physiological terms they also compete because when a given egg develops say into a worker it is essentially diverting a share of the available energy to this caste rather than to any other providing that the total amount of energy available to the colony is limited the subpopulation of each caste compete among themselves for shares of this energy that is the sense under which we say that soldiers compete with workers and alates for simplicity and in the absence of detail on the ontogeny of c cyphergaster colonies in cerrado biome our model depicts a qualitative picture of the first stages of a colony s ontogeny from founding to first swarm focusing on these stages sounds appropriate because we model the ontogenic precursors of invasions by an obligatory inquiline that after succeeding invasion becomes the sole permanent inquiline in a colony it is also worth considering that despite knowing that i microcerus invades c cyphergaster when nests attain 12 l cristaldo et al 2012 we do not know how long it takes for such nests to attain this size in cerrado the time figures here used therefore should be taken relatively rather than absolutely i e time steps rather than proper days 2 3 1 the dynamics of the termite colony having the above constraints in mind a termite colony dynamics can be described as follows after leaving their natal nests finding a partner and founding a new colony the royal couple begins the production of sterile individuals soldiers and workers see above for the colony growth this ergonomic period oster and wilson 1978 ends with the first bang after reaching an adequate size having accumulated sufficient resources and individuals the colony enters the reproductive period the colony invests resources in the production of fertile individuals the alates which will fly away to found new colonies the beginning of the flight season characterises the second bang just after the flight the colony is depleted of resources and lacks enough workers to forage for replenishment sterile individuals naturally dying are not replaced until the colony is able to resume a new cycle in summary our model comprises i the ergonomic phase starting at 0 time steps ts and ending with the first bang at 160 ts ii the reproductive phase starting at 160 ts and ending with the second bang at about 190 ts and iii the flight phase starting at 190 ts and ending at about 350 time steps 2 3 2 model description the model considers that the termite population composing a colony c comprises three different castes subpopulations the workers w the soldiers s and winged reproductives or sexuals r the number of individuals in each of these castes varies in time t therefore we consider w t the number of workers in the instant t s t the number of soldiers in the instant t r t the number of winged reproductives sexuals in the instant t thus the total population in the time t is given by 1 c t w t s t r t the resources are assumed to be abundant upon acquisition by the colony the resources are allocated differentially to the production of castes throughout the cycle in the ergonomic period colony growth resources are directed to the production of sterile individuals workers and soldiers whereas in the reproductive period the resources are directed to the production reproductive nestmates at the expense of the steriles in our model fig 1 the total amount of available resources γ is diverted to the production of new workers soldiers and sexuals the workers receive a fraction 1 u of these resources while the soldiers and alates receive u the resource amount represented by this latter quantity in turn is split among alates and soldiers while alates receive a fraction 1 a of u soldiers receive a the quantity a is dependent on the colony being at the ergonomic or at the reproductive stage in such a way that at the ergonomic stage a 1 and 1 a 0 that is no investment is made on sexuals at the reproductive stage soldiers receive a lessened share of resources a 1 so that sexuals can receive some share of it 1 a 0 the birth of workers w soldiers s and alates r resulting from such investments is counteracted respectively by mortality rates μ w μ s and μ r final mortality rates of workers and sexuals however are reduced by the protection p offered by the soldiers the number of individuals in each caste at a given time w t s t and r t can be thus described by the coupled system of ordinary differential equations 2 w 1 u t γ t w t μ w w t p s u t a t γ t w t μ s s t r 1 a t u t γ t w t μ r r t p where represents differentiation in time d d t e g d s d t s the amount of resources γ available for colony growth depends on the difference between the amount collected 3 γ 0 1 tanh k s t w t r t and the consumption of these resources by individuals at rate α is 4 α 1 tanh k s t w t r t where 5 tanh k s t w t r t makes resource gathering and consumption dependent on the proportion of soldiers s relative to the total numbers of workers w plus alates r increasing the value of the ratio s w r means that i workers are better in collecting resources because there is more protection from soldiers whereas ii there are stronger drains on these resources as soldiers are trophically dependent on workers since either the benefit or the cost of soldiers does not grow forever such a limit is set by tanh whose steepness is regulated by k the total amount of resources γ at any given time is hence 6 γ γ 0 α w t 1 tanh k s t w t r t this will of course depend on the mortality rates of each caste which in turn is affected see eq 2 by the protection p provided by soldiers 7 p 1 tanh k s t w t r t as each caste has a different dynamics we consider distinct mortality rates μ w μ s and μ r for workers soldiers and alates respectively 2 3 3 running the model since we have modified the original bang bang model to include an additional physical sterile caste soldiers which competes for resources directly with alates it seemed advisable to include an extra bang in the model as well therefore our running of this model comprises three phases as detailed below see also eq 2 and fig 1 phase 1 before the first bang at this point only workers and soldiers are produced hence a 1 no investment on alates and the numbers of workers w soldiers s and alates r satisfy while γ and p obey eqs 6 and 7 respectively phase 2 after the first and before the second bang at this point the investment on alates begins and soldiers receive a smaller share of resources a 1 the number of individuals is hence w 1 u t γ t w t μ w w t p s u t a t γ t w t μ s s t r 1 a t u t γ t w t μ r r t p phase 3 after the second bang now the model is fully in the reproductive stage and the investment on workers goes to zero 1 u 0 it follows that the number of individuals is explained by 2 3 4 parametrisation all parameters used in these equations are summarised at table 1 parameters have been chosen arbitrarily so that we could properly simulate our hypothesis after all the whole idea was to simulate an ideal abstract model and look for any real world field evidence of such a dynamics see section overall rationale above gamma zero production capacity is higher than alpha consumption rate to make sure that the colony produces always more than what it consumes at any cycle this is probably biologically true for a colony in good shape and guarantees our premise the castes compete for resources that are limited the actual values are chosen within a range to avoid saturations in other words we set them in a range to be able to observe the model s dynamics when the variables s t w t and r t change over time obviously if gamma zero is huge compared to alpha it does not matter how the colony allocate resources because there are so many resources that the colony can do what it wants and no competition dynamics is installed among castes the same is true if alpha is too small compared to gamma zero so this values are chosen to be able to observe the effects induced by the variations of the model s variables based on the assumptions the same happens for the mortality rates the actual numbers were chosen in a way to avoid saturation effects if these rates are too high there is no dynamics to be observed the overall logic is also dictated by our previous observations that soldiers die at a higher rate than worker and reproductives the parameter t has no biological meaning it has been chosen long enough to allow the whole model dynamics predicted in our hypothesis the parameters k does not have any significant effects since it is set to 1 it could be removed but we decided to let it in the model to allow its use in case someone would intend to vary the steepness of the curve generated by t a n g h to see how this influence the model dynamics so to conclude there is an overall logic dictated by biological evidence in the relative magnitude that each parameter holds compared to all the others however the actual values have no biological meaning they were chosen in a range to be able to observe the model dynamics without facing saturation effects 2 4 empirical tests empirical tests were carried out to verify i whether a tradeoff between nest defence and reproduction could be observed in field colonies as predicted by the model and ii whether we could find evidence for a correlation between such a tradeoff and a propensity for the termite colony to be invaded by inquilines note that we are not explicitly or manipulatively testing every step in our dynamic model rather we are simply checking whether field colonies observed along a full reproductive cycle would present populational parameters as predicted by our model a total of 154 c cyphergaster nests have been used to generate field data as detailed below specimens collected from these nests to confirm the identity of the cohabiting termites were stored in 80 alcohol labelled and identified according to mathews 1977 and constantino 2002 later the identifications were confirmed by comparison with the samples deposited at isoptera section of the museum of entomology at the federal university of viçosa 2 4 1 the focal species we have chosen as a model host guest pair of species the host termite c cyphergaster termitidae nasutitermitinae and its obligatory inquiline i microcerus termitidae termitinae this host termite is commonly found in brazil paraguay bolivia and argentina where it is known to produce workers and soldiers throughout the year while concentrating its alates release just before the rainy season cunha and brandão 2002 moura et al 2006 their arboreal nest s earthen walls are initially crumbly but tend to get thicker and harder with nest age as the nest grows older it grows in volume nests house different invertebrate cohabitants but only one of two species of obligatory inquilines are common i microcerus and inquilinitermes fur termitidae termitinae i microcerus are more likely to establish themselves in these host nests after they attain 12 litters cristaldo et al 2012 and once established they keep themselves restricted to certain regions of the nest cunha et al 2003 as if avoiding to be detected by the builder in addition this inquiline seems to prevent contacts and hence conflicts with their hosts feeding on a distinct diet florencio et al 2013 and decoding and avoiding hosts trail and alarm cues cristaldo et al 2014 2016 we always selected nests from a continuous range of volume because nest size is a relevant factor for cohabitation cristaldo et al 2012 nest volume estimation is detailed in the supporting information 2 4 2 study area the study was conducted in the brazilian cerrado biome an environment

we inspected whether termite field colonies would trade defence for reproduction as predicted by our hypothesis and dissected by the model to tackle this issue we considered that while the soldier contingent can be a surrogate for the colony s defence investment the presence of alate individuals including nymphs in a nest would announce that the colony has entered a reproductive stage we hence inspected in the field whether the presence of host alates in a colony would correlate negatively with the percentage of host soldiers relative to the total host population in that colony workers soldiers alates however even diminishing the proportion of soldiers a colony could still keep the same defence level providing the remaining soldiers became more active in patrolling the nest desouza et al 2016 to account for this effect we performed an additional bioassay in the field testing whether soldier patrolling would be negatively affected by the presence of alates in the colonies the population numbers and composition in a termite colony fluctuates naturally along its annual reproductive cycle nutting 1969 martius and ribeiro 1996 lepage and darlington 2002 if for no reason other than due to the release of alates in the swarming season to account for this we performed the above tests before during and after the flight season to account for populational fluctuations not associated to the swarm itself we inspected reproducing and non reproducing colonies in the cerrado biome where experiments have been carried out these periods correspond instituto nacional de meteorologia 2016 respectively to the peak of the dry season in the winter july the beginning of the rainy season in the spring november and the mid rainy season in the summer january percentage of soldiers to verify whether the presence of alates would affect the percentage of soldiers in the colony we performed a complete census of 25 c cyphergaster nests in 2015 10 nests in january eight in july and seven in november in divinópolis to do so nests of varying volumes were selected in the field and taken to laboratory where they were broken into pieces and all visible individuals were collected with tweezers and stored in 80 alcohol then the nest fragments were passed through series of stainless steel sieves with openings of 4 75 2 00 1 00 and 0 50 mm capturing termites eventually found after that nest fragments were placed under a 100 watts incandescent lamp in berlese funnels over a receptacle containing 80 alcohol after two days the receptacle was sifted to extract all termites therein fallen this whole setup was enclosed in a cage of muslin to prevent termite alates to escape by flying soldier patrolling in order to verify the patrolling activity of soldiers we carried out a field assay obeying the same procedures of desouza et al 2016 an experimental disturbance was inflicted on the nest wall and the number of individuals attending this disturbance was tallied up such a physical disturbance was made to a point located halfway between the nest s base and top using the stainless steel blade of a pocket knife to jab the nest on its exterior wall forming a 3 5 1 cm length diameter cylindrical hole this blade was always cleaned with 70 ethanol before each trial a wooden stick c a 20 0 5 cm length diameter was immediately and partially inserted into this hole for 40 s after which clinging worker and soldier termites were shaken into a plastic tray held right below the stick for each trial a new stick was used termites were collected from the tray stored and identified as described above all tests have been conducted directly at nests in their normal state still attached to the trees in the field a total of 81 c cyphergaster nests of varying volumes have been assayed 35 of which in january 19 in july and 21 in november 2015 in divinópolis 2 4 4 would inquilines settlement correlate to host colony reproduction to inspect the above issue we have taken 37 nests of c cyphergaster from the field estimated their volume and broke them apart in the lab in search of i microcerus inquilines as well as host s alates this bioassay took place in july 2007 pre flight season in sete lagoas 2 5 statistical analysis empirical data were analysed in a threefold procedure firstly we inspected whether the percentage of soldiers relative to the total population of the host a continuous binomial yvar would be affected by the presence of young host alates a categorical xvar in the nest modelling proceeded under binomial errors then we inspected whether the patrolling activity of soldiers a continuous yvar would be affected by the presence of young host alates in the nest patrolling activity was defined as the number of soldiers attending a physical disturbance on the nest wall see details above modelling proceeded under quasipoisson errors to correct for overdispersion detected in a first try with poisson errors the full model in both cases included nest volume and seasonality pre flight flight and post flight periods as covariates finally we inspected whether the presence of inquilines binary yvar 0 absence 1 presence in the host nest was affected by the presence of host alates categorical xvar modelling proceeded by logistic regression under binomial errors the full model included nest volume as a covariate all data in this case refer to a single season pre flight the data were analysed under generalised linear models glm followed by residual analyses to check the suitability of the errors distribution and the adjustment of the model crawley 2007 model simplification was performed using the akaike information criterion aic and second order aic aicc as well as the qaic or qaicc for over dispersed data burnham and anderson 2002 the best model was defined as the one presenting the lowest δ a i c value and highest weight the analyses were performed in r development core team 2016 with the package mumin barton 2015 3 results 3 1 modelling as depicted in fig 2 our theoretical model predicts the numbers of workers and soldiers to build up during the ergonomic phase and to drop steadily in the reproductive phase right after the alates start to be produced the number of alates thus is negatively correlated to the number of soldiers and incidentally that of workers composing a given colony at any given time after alates are released in their nuptial flight the model keeps predicting strong decrements in the colony population 3 2 empirical tests 3 2 1 soldier proportions young host reproductives the corrected volumes for the 24 c cyphergaster nests used in this field assay ranged from 3 4 to 37 litres with a mean of 13 3 litres supporting predictions from the theoretical model the proportion of host soldiers correlated negatively with the presence of host alates in the nests but it was not affected by the season or by the nest volume table 2 fig 3 the minimum adequate statistical model thereby achieved predicts the proportion of soldiers to vary as 8 log e p q 1 1358 1 029 r e p r where p q or p r o p s in table 2 is the ratio of the number of host soldiers to total population in a nest and r e p r is a binary variable describing the presence r e p r 1 or the absence r e p r 0 of young host reproductives in that nest 3 2 2 patrolling behaviour young host reproductives the corrected volumes for the 81 c cyphergaster nests used in this field assay ranged from 3 9 to 47 litres with a mean of 15 7 litres the number of host soldiers attending the experimental disturbance on the nest wall i e patrolling by soldiers after the first 40 s had elapsed ranged from 0 to 49 with an mean of 9 2 again supporting predictions from the theoretical model patrolling by host soldiers was depressed by the presence of alates in the nest and as the seasons proceeded from pre flight flight to post flight table 2 fig 4 the minimum adequate model thereby achieved predicts the number of patrolling soldiers to vary as 9 log e p a t r o l s 1 8011 0 4533 r e p r s e a s o n where p a t r o l s is the number of patrolling soldiers attending the experimental disturbance on the nest wall r e p r is a binary variable describing the presence r e p r 1 or the absence r e p r 0 of host winged reproductives in that nest and s e a s o n is a variable describing distinct periods of the host reproductive cycle replacing estimates for this variable accordingly one can get the respective model for post flight s e a s o n 0 pre flight s e a s o n 0 9530 and flight s e a s o n 0 9421 3 2 3 inquilinism young host reproductives the corrected volumes for the 37 c cyphergaster nests used in this field assay ranged from 3 4 to 34 7 litres with a mean of 13 1 litres the totality of the 19 nests containing host alates also housed i microcerus inquilines among the other 18 nests void of alates only six housed inquilines the prevalence of inquilinism in these nests was therefore 19 6 37 0 675 or 67 5 supporting our hypothesis the presence of host alates in c cyphergaster nests strongly enhanced the chances of finding inquilines therein fig 5 this was so evident that inquilines where found even in small nests volume 12 l as long as host alates where also present nests as small as those are normally predicted to not house inquilines cristaldo et al 2012 conversely and in accordance with this previous work in the absence of winged reproductives only after attaining around 12 l did the nest house inquilines fig 5 among all candidate statistical models the one holding these two factors winged reproductives and nest size was appointed by the model selection procedure as the best model table 2 fig 5 according to this model the likelihood of housing inquilines could be explained by 10 log e p q 5 4372 0 4823 v o l 18 8643 r e p r where p q or i n q in table 2 is the odds ratio of housing not housing an inquiline colony v o l is the host nest volume in litres and r e p r is a binary variable representing the presence r e p r 1 or the absence r e p r 0 of host winged reproductives in that nest 4 discussion the moment when potential symbioses initiate and the mechanism behind it are normally viewed as a failure in the self non self discriminating system immune system hereafter while this seems indeed the case of parasitic symbioses it would not closely fit mutualistic and perhaps commensal associations a more encompassing concept would state that the immune system functions as a passport control agent or a bouncer as opposed to a barrier intended to keep the host pure gilbert 2014 that is interlopers are allowed in or barred based on the host s evolutionary experience about their potential danger matzinger 1994 successful intruders in this context would be those presenting low risk relative to the cost of being barred by the host this seems to explain why a single inquiline genus inquilinitermes is reported to compose the termite termite macros symbiosis here described being refractory to inquilines other than i fur and i microcerus colonies of c cyphergaster seem to be able to perform such a selective access control in its turn the host specialists inquilinitermes spp being obligatory inquilines seem to possess the ability to detect the precise moments of favourable resistance tolerance gatekeeping in its host that is these inquilines would profit from a window of opportunity to infiltrate simultaneously these inquilines present strategies to go unnoticed in their host colony cristaldo et al 2014 hugo et al 2020 indeed our results support the hypothesis that inquiline termites can sneak into their host termite colonies as these latter undergo a defence reproduction tradeoff this would endorse the idea that the symbiotic link between i microcerus termites and their termite hosts c cyphergaster can be elicited by a window of opportunity in which self non self discrimination is loosened desouza et al 2016 the following lines of evidence allow such a statement first this tradeoff was shown to happen in modelled termite colonies when a physical defence specialist caste soldiers competed for resources with a reproductive caste alates and with a physical resource gatherer specialist caste workers figs 1 and 2 in such a model soldiers are traded for alates as the colony maturates and this closely resembles our field data indeed in c cyphergaster termites field colonies which entered reproduction held a population depleted of soldiers fig 3 tables 2 and 3 working with amazonian termites pequeno and franklin 2018 also found evidence for a tradeoff between colony investment in soldiers reproduction diminished soldier numbers would not necessarily lead to weakened defence as the individual working load could be enhanced to compensate lowered contingent however in a manipulative field assay we could confirm that this tradeoff did affect defence not only a significant diminution in soldier patrolling rate was observed in reproducing colonies fig 4 tables 2 and 3 but also inquilines were more likely to be found in these colonies fig 5 this shift from intolerance to tolerance easing symbioses has been previously reported to depend on ontogenetic changes in some hosts in the same termite host guest pair here studied rodrigues et al 2018 and cristaldo et al 2012 reported a higher prevalence of inquilines in older colonies of the host c cyphergaster indicating that younger colonies are less tolerant to invasion similarly mature phase galls induced by the aphid tamalia coweni support higher numbers of inquiline aphids t inquilinus than do early or trophic phase galls miller iii and crespi 2003 ontogenetic change is also reported to guide tolerance to cleaning annelids by their crayfish partners skelton et al 2014 as with our termite colonies younger and smaller crayfish are less tolerant because they present more effective patrolling apparatus than older and larger ones in the case of termite colonies this patrolling is performed by the soldier contingent which is less tolerant in smaller younger than in larger older nests as for crayfish patrolling is done by the dactyls of their walking legs which can reach larger areas of the carapace of the intolerant youngsters similar tolerance associated to morphological changes dependent on ontogeny was reported by dunlap et al 2012 for sea urchin cardinalfish and their symbiotic luminous bacteria in this system infection occur only after the host s light organ undergoes initial development hypothetical mechanism in the termite colonies here studied the ontogenetic change leading to the acceptance of inquilines was shown to occur at the onset of the host s reproductive phase fig 5 a similar shift towards tolerance at the reproductive phase has been reported for sceloporus occidentalis squamata phrynosomatidae lizards whose pregnant females bear more ticks than nonpregnant ones pollock et al 2012 but what are the likely mechanisms behind this tradeoff in termites why is it even possible a likely hypothesis might state that this is merely a consequence of the normal ontogeny of the termite host colony as the number of soldiers builds up in a growing colony the titres of juvenile hormone jh rapidly decreases in larvae as a consequence of increments in the amount of primer pheromones produced by the soldiers themselves lefeuve and bordereau 1984 tian and zhou 2014 this would divert the differentiation of these youngsters to alates rather than additional presoldiers henderson 1998 mao et al 2005 park and raina 2005 watanabe et al 2011 2014 korb 2015 when this production of alates claims excessive numbers of young larvae it also impacts negatively the number of workers the primary food gathering caste of the colony this would lead to food shortage in the colony which in turn reestablishes high rates of jh synthesis in larvae recovering soldier production and closing the window of opportunity for invasion by inquilines albeit not aimed at testing this hypothesis our data bring at least two precursors to it i our model predicts a peak in soldier production right before the flight period fig 2 and ii the percentage of soldiers in the nest population was significantly higher in field colonies from which winged reproductives were absent fig 3 accordingly lucena et al 2019 observed a drop in the number of workers conjugated with increments in the number of soldiers right after the release of alates in colonies of this same host termite c cyphergaster in the caatinga semiarid region of northeastern brazil 4 1 conclusion we show that defence reproduction tradeoffs more than a strategy to optimise resource use can be important initiators of symbioses if changes in the internal stasis of an organism or a superorganism hölldobler and wilson 2008 can loosen self non self discrimination enhancing tolerance it could be invoked to explain i why stress and disturbance are important drivers of symbioses seckbach and grube 2010 monteiro et al 2017 and of species coexistence bertness and callaway 1994 solar et al 2015 and ii why interindividual communication is eased in stressful contexts miramontes and desouza 1996 desouza et al 2001 clearly these are mere speculations which although not

24527,the habitat suitability model is coupled with the two dimensional high precision hydrodynamic model in this paper in the model finite volume method fvm with godunov type is adopted to solve the two dimensional hydrodynamic process which has good robustness and second order temporal and spatial accuracy habitat suitability model is constructed by habitat suitability index based on ifim theory meanwhile the introduction of gpu acceleration technology greatly improves the simulation efficiency combined with the results of river2d the results of this model have good accuracy the model was applied to simulate the spawning habitat of gymnocypris eckloni in the lower reaches of a hydropower station in the upper yellow river and the reasonable discharged flow of hydropower station required for a good spawning habitat was 74 m3 s it increased by 53 377 compared with the average annual discharge in may of the natural river the evaluation of the spawning habitat of gymnocypris eckloni provides a scientific basis for protecting the integrity of river ecosystem in this paper graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords high precision hydrodynamic model habitat suitability model weighted usable area discharged flow habitat suitability index 1 introduction the construction of a large number of water conservancy projects not only ensures the reasonable allocation of water resources but also plays a role in other benefits thus becoming the basic guarantee for the sustainable and healthy development of the economy and society mao and dai 2016 however rivers are also the natural space for the survival of various aquatic organisms cheng 2008 with the increasing utilization of river water resources water ecological problems are gradually emerging the construction of reservoirs lead to the changes in river hydrological regime sharp decrease in biodiversity and degradation of local ecological functions foulger and petts 1984 pringle 2003 caissie 2006 meanwhile dams block the passage of migratory fish affecting the communication between species in addition the rapid change of river level also causes the alternating exposure and inundation of shoals which affects the habitat and spawning of fish zhang 2017 li et al 2013 ma et al 2020 to alleviate the stress of water conservancy project on river ecosystem people have taken a series of the measures of reservoir ecological operation and river ecological restoration the united states was the first to put forward the concept of eco environmental water flow requirement in the 1870 s which stipulated that in order to avoid river ecosystem degradation rivers should maintain the minimum ecological flow covich 1993 xu et al 2004 a large number of calculation methods emerged including hydrology methods such as 7q10 tennant and basic flow method et al hydraulic methods such as wetted perimeter method and r2 cross and habitat modeling simulation method such as instream flow incremental methodology tennant 1976 palau and alcazar 1996 gippel and stewardson 1998 tarme 2003 bovee 1982 habitat model simulation methods are also most widely used methods in the world instream flow incremental methodology ifim was the earliest applied method among which to evaluate the impact of the discharge changes on fish habitat so as to improve ecological environment by regulating discharge bovee 1982 rhomas 1998 with the proposal of habitat suitability index hsi it had been applied in more than 80 of the global habitat models yi et al 2010 to determine the relationship between indicative target species and habitat factors bockelmann et al 2004 a one dimensional physical habitat simulation model phabsim based on ifim uses this index to simulate the quantitative relationship between discharge and suitable habitat area stalnaker et al 1995 mark 2010 since the accuracy of habitat factors is very important for the simulation of the river ecological environment more accurately and the evaluation the quality of aquatic habitats more and more hydraulic models have been introduced in particular the two dimensional hydrodynamic model can accurately simulate the river hydrodynamic characteristics and fish habitat among which the two dimensional finite element habitat model river2d with average depth is widely adopted steffler and blackburn 2002 naderi 2021 however due to the lack of professional maintenance of river2d complicated operation low accuracy of terrain processing and the phenomenon of flashback often occurs in the simulation in recent years scholars have introduced the complex and accurate two dimensional or three dimensional fluid dynamics models delft3d mike21 ssiim model etc coupled with habitat suitability models to continuously improve the spatial and temporal resolution of river channel variables olsen and stokseth 1995 li and xia 2011 belgiorno et al 2013 but for the large scale and complex flow pattern of rivers these models still have the shortcomings of insufficient simulation accuracy and long simulation time so the two dimensional high precision hydrodynamic model is coupled with habitat suitability model namely gast model gpu accelerated surface water flow and transport model to evaluate the habitat quality of single or multi species aquatic organisms in gast model finite volume method fvm with godunov type is adopted to simulate two dimensional hydrodynamic process which has good robustness and second order temporal and spatial accuracy to acquire more accurate habitat factor values and the introduction of gpu acceleration technology greatly improves the simulation efficiency in terms of simulating the hydrodynamic process compared with mike21 fm model the calculation efficiency is improved by 1 06 to 2 37 times and the calculation accuracy of 5 m accuracy terrain is improved by 1 07 to 9 56 times in simulating complex flow patterns based on gast model hou and li 2018 in addition most models built are cpu based gast model can improve the simulation computing efficiency by 23 88 to 158 72 times by using gpu acceleration technology compared with cpu technology gong and hou 2020 based on this habitat suitability model used habitat suitability index was coupled which makes the model a more powerful tool for evaluating habitat quality in this paper gast model was obtained by coupling a two dimensional high precision hydrodynamic model with a habitat suitability model firstly the basic governing equations and numerical solutions of this model were described and gpu acceleration technology was introduced to greatly improve the simulation efficiency secondly the lower reach of a proposed hydropower station in the upper yellow river was taken as the research object and gymnocypris eckloni was selected as the target fish the effective spawning habitat of fish under various flow conditions was simulated based on this model besides the results were validated with that from river2d model ultimately the minimum discharge required for the spawning habitat of gymnocypris eckloni downstream of the proposed hydropower station to be in good condition was determined 2 gast model 2 1 hydrodynamic model the basic governing equations of the surface hydrodynamic model adopted in this model are the planar 2d shallow water equations swes hou et al 2014 which is derived directly from hydrodynamic physical process or simplified from three dimensional navier stokes n s equations it is widely used in the hydrodynamic simulations of various hydraulic engineering and other engineering hou et al 2013b to describe a large range of flow hydrodynamics with a much larger horizontal dimension than the direction along water depth liang et al 2016 based on the conservation of mass and momentum assuming that the hydrostatic pressure distribution is followed and the kinematic viscous term turbulent viscous term wind stress and coriolis force are ignored the 2d shallow water equations swes in a matrix form can be written as liang and borthwick 2009 hou et al 2014 hou et al 2017 1 q t f x g y s 2 q h uh vh f uh u 2 h g h 2 2 uvh g vh uvh v 2 h g h 2 2 s 0 gh z b x c f u u 2 v 2 gh z b y c f v u 2 v 2

suitability index hsi to quantify the specific behavior of a target organism ma 2020 in this model the univariate suitability curve is the most commonly used to characterize the habitat suitability of target species whose habitat suitability is defined as 0 the least suitable to 1 the most suitable armour and taylor 1991 on the basis of establishing habitat suitability index hsi curves of each habitat factor the combined suitability index csi is calculated from the individual suitability of the major habitat factors also from 0 to 1 jowett and davey 2007 the weighted usable area wua was calculated by simulating the suitability of target species to hydraulic factors wua is the sum of the product of each control unit area and combined habitat suitability index csi in the study area yi

when a certain habitat factor is unfavorable eq 6 represents csi is determined by the most unsuitable habitat factor among three habitat factors in this paper only three habitat factors were considered namely water depth discharge and the substrate if any of the selected habitat factors were not unsuitable the habitat of organisms would be greatly affected thus from the perspective of the most unfavorable habitat factors eq 6 was adopted in this paper to obtain the comprehensive suitability index 3 numerical solution method 3 1 numerical solution of hydrodynamic model in solving two dimensional shallow water equations swes usually finite volume method finite difference method and finite element method are adopted a multi speed discrete boltzmann method was proposed in recent years but it is not widely adopted rocca et al 2020 the cell centered finite volume ccfv method of godunov scheme is used in this paper hou et al 2015 the study area is divided into triangular or quadrilateral computing units and the control volume of cell centered finite volume ccfv is used as the cell in control cell i the integral form of the governing equations is expressed as hou et al

respectively g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 in this model the van leer approximate riemann solver with the contact wave restored hllc is adopted to compute the fluxes of mass and momentum at the interface which automatically satisfies the godunov scheme and is the most suitable numerical solution for the dry and wet boundary marche et al 2007 hou et al 2013a the bottom slope source term is treated by the bottom slope flux method which is well coordinated with the interface flux and satisfies the condition of full stability and combined with non negative depth reconstruction the dry and wet boundary problems can also be effectively dealt with bermudez and vazquez 1994 in this simulation the grid cell judgment condition of dry and wet water depth is 0 000 001 m explicit implicit friction treatment method with better stability is used to calculate the frictional flux term to achieve implicit computation without iteration the calculation accuracy and efficiency are considered hou et al 2013b meanwhile muscl method is used to reorganize the variables with spatial second order accuracy hou et al 2014 runge kutta method is used to implement time step of time variable to obtain second order time accuracy in addition cfl courant friedrichs lewy condition is used to limit the time step to maintain its good stability the time step formula is as follows courant et al 1967

respectively m s h is water depth m cfl is called the courant and has a value from 0 to 1 with the increase of coulomb number the convergence speed of grid computing is gradually accelerated and the stability is gradually decreased cfl is defined as 0 5 in this model 3 2 gpu parallel computing technology and model coupling to solve the problem of large amount of calculation low calculation efficiency and calculation divergence caused by high precision terrain gpu graphic processing unit acceleration technology based on cuda compute unified device architecture is adopted in this model which is developed by nvidia and written in c language liang et al 2016 compared with cpu gpus can provide tens or even hundreds of times more power than cpus in parallel computing as the structure of gpu is relatively simple the number of threads and registers is far more than that of cpu mainstream gpus are more than 10 times that of cpus of the same period in terms of single precision floating point processing power due to the powerful floating point processing capacity cpu and gpu architecture as shown in figure 1 in actual execution the program code of gpu acceleration technology based on cuda includes host code running on cpu and device code running on gpu while the data transfer between cpu and gpu is implemented by cudamemcpy function smith and liang 2013 the cpu and gpu architecture is shown in figure 1 based on cuda architecture the c language is used to read the grid initial and boundary conditions and output the results and to realize gpu high speed parallel loop

economic development of qinghai province it is proposed to build a hydropower station on the main stream of the upper yellow river which is about 5 km upstream of laja town maqin county qinghai province the dam site of the hydropower station controls a basin area of 98 346 km² with mean annual discharge is 530 m³ s and the normal water level for it is 3275 m the corresponding storage capacity is 1 482 billion m³ of which the regulated storage capacity is 706 million m³ the reach of 1 8 km downstream of the dam of this hydropower station is a more important fish habitat and a major spawning area based on the results of fish habitat survey to protect the downstream river ecological environment the river reach was taken as the study area which twists and turns and is like chinese character ji meaning a few in plane the location of it was shown in figure 3 as an advanced species of aquatic organisms fish habitat indicates the quality of river ecological environment in this reach gymnocypris eckloni was selected as a target fish for aquatic organisms and its habitat distribution during the main spawning period may was studied to reflect the habitat conditions of the river the average annual discharge of natural river in may was 434 m3 s during the operation of hydropower station the average annual discharge of normal 392 8 m3 s and dry years 352 7 m3 s in may should be considered as the discharged flow of hydropower station to ensure the fish breeding in the downstream channel in addition the minimum discharge of the river reach under the dam should be no less than 63 6 m3 s to maintain aquatic ecological stability and river landscape when the high precision two dimensional hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the distribution of water depth and velocity in river the discharge was the upstream boundary condition and the corresponding water level was the downstream boundary condition water level downstream under different discharges was shown in table 1 4 2 suitable curve of habitat factors through the investigation of aquatic experts the ecological habits and hydraulics characteristics of the habitat of gymnocypris eckloni were collected and summarized and the spawning period from early may to june of it was obtained may was used as the main spawning period in this study and focused on the suitability of it to the velocity water depth and the substrate the suitability of the velocity water depth and the substrate of gymnocypris eckloni during spawning period is the suitable water depth 0 1 to 2 0 m and the optimal water depth is 0 4 to 1 2 m the suitable velocity is 0 25 to 1 5 m s and the optimal velocity is 0 5 to 1 0 m s the substrate condition of this river reach is sand and gravel mixed with sediment which shows that the suitable substrate condition is sand gravel and fine sand and distributed in this reach habitat suitability index hsi was adopted to quantify the fish habitat preference which was expressed as a value between 0 and 1 the higher the value the better the adaptability based on this the suitability index of hydraulic habitat parameters was determined and the suitability curves of major hydraulic factors was drawn of gymnocypris eckloni during spawning period as shown in figure 4 4 3 parameter calibration to reasonably select the roughness value of reach the discharge of 230 m3 s was used for calibration based on the simulated and the measured water level of each section the simulated water level is in good agreement with the measured when the comprehensive roughness of the reach is 0 05 s m1 3 the results were shown in figure 5 thus the manning coefficient n 0 05 s m1 3 4 4 model validation due to the lack of actual monitoring data on the weighted usable area wua of spawning habitat of gymnocypris eckloni in the study area the simulation results of river2d model were adopted to verify the rationality of the simulation results of gast model river2d is called the two dimensional depth averaged model of river hydrodynamics and fish habitat which uses the finite element method to numerically solve the depth average model equations the discharges of 26 5 m3 s 53 m3 s 74 m3 s 79 5 m3 s 106 m3 s 159 m3 s 212 m3 s 318 m3 s 434 m3 s 530 m3 s 689 m3 s 848 m3 s 1060 m3 s were selected to calculate the effective habitat area which was represented by the weighted usable area of gymnocypris eckloni the simulation results based on gast model and river2d model were shown in table 2 and the relationship between the discharges were obtained based on the simulation of gast model and river2d model as shown in figure 6 as could be seen from table 2 and figure 6 the relationship between the weighted available area of spawning habitat and the discharges based on gast model and river2d model was almost identical the results showed that the effective habitat area begins to increase with the increase of the discharge and when it reached the peak the effective habitat area began to decrease with the increase of the discharge this phenomenon is mainly caused that as the discharge increased so done the water depth and velocity that is the area of the suitable water depth and velocity for gymnocypris eckloni to spawn also increased but after reaching a discharge as the discharge continued to increase and the velocity was too fast and the water was too deep was greater than that of gymnocypris eckloni spawning suitable water depth and velocity this moment the effective habitat area tends to decrease therefore there was a peak in the weighted available area at a discharge of 74 m3 s compared with river2d model the effective spawning habitat area of gymnocypris eckloni in the study reach obtained by gast model was slightly larger which was due to more accurate velocities and water depths obtained by gast model under high resolution terrain conditions 5 results and analysis 5 1 distribution of water depth and velocity according to the relationship between the weighted available area of gymnocypris eckloni spawning habitat and the discharges the weighted available area reaches the maximum when the the discharge was 74 m3 s therefore the average annual discharge of natural river 434 m3 s in may the average annual discharge of normal 392 8 m3 s and dry years 352 7 m3 s in may and and the proposed minimum discharge of 74 m3 s was considered to further determine the reasonable discharged flow of hydropower station the high precision two dimensional hydrodynamic model gast model was adopted to simulate the distribution of water depth and flow velocity in the study area the study reach was divided into 404 544 rectangular grids with a cellsize of 5m using argis software to generate high precision terrain files for gast models the distribution of water depth and flow velocity was shown in figure 7 based on the simulation results of water depth and velocity under different discharges the average water depth and velocity increased significantly when the discharge increased from 74 m3 s to 352 7 m3 s while there was little difference between 352 7 m3 s 392 8 m3 s and 434 m3 s when the discharge was 74 m3 s the average water depth was about 1 20 m and the average velocity was about 0 38 m s while the discharge was 434 m3 s the average water depth was about 2 31 m and the average velocity was about 0 59 m s it could thus be seen that the average water depth was about 48 05 of the natural may 434 m3 s and the average velocity was about 35 59 of that when the discharge was 74 m3 s 5 2 combined habitat suitable index due to the substrate condition of this river reach is sand and gravel mixed with sediment it meets the substrate condition of gymnocypris eckloni spawning the habitat suitable index of the substrate in this river reach is 1 based on the simulation results of three hydraulic factors namely water depth velocity and substrate a combined habitat suitability index csi was obtained by coupling fish habitat simulation method to reflect the habitat distribution of gymnocypris eckloni during spawning period the distribution of it was shown in figure 8 it could be seen that the spawning habitat area increased when the discharge decreased from 434 m3 s to 74 m3 s and the distribution location shifted from two banks to the center of river in figure 6 a under the average annual discharge in may of natural river of 434 m3 s the spawning habitats were mainly distributed on both sides of river and the spawning sites were more concentrated at the bend of river in figure 6 b and c under the discharge in may of normal year of 392 8 m3 s and the discharge in may of normal year of 352 7 m3 s the spawning habitats distribution were consistent with figure 6 a there was not much difference between them in figure 6 d under the proposed minimum discharge of 74 m3 s the spawning habitats shifted to the center of river mainly distributed in the center of river which caused this change was that study river reach belonged to a wide and shallow one most of river sections had broad and flat undersides with the decreasing of river discharge the water depth velocity and cross section width decreased as a result the effective habitat area in the original suitable area for spawning decreased and the central area of river changed from the original unsuitable area to the suitable area meanwhile the weighted usable area wua of spawning habitat of gymnocypris eckloni were calculated under different discharges the wua was 132 022 88 m2 under the average annual discharge in may of natural river of 434 m3 s after the operation of hydropower station the wua was 136 627 75 m2 143 027 48 m2 and 202 492 08 m2 under the discharge in may of normal year of 392 8 m3 s under the discharge in may of dry year of 352 7 m3 s and the proposed minimum discharge of 74 m3 s respectively compared with in may of natural river the effective habitat area in may of normal year and in may of dry year with an increase of 3 488 and 8 335 respectively while e proposed minimum discharge of 74 m3 s with an increase of 53 377 to sum up if the discharge of 392 8 m3 s or 352 7 m3 s is taken as the minimum ecological discharge the increase of effective habitat area was not significant but the discharge of 74 m3 s is selected as the minimum ecological discharge the effective habitat area increased significantly compared with the discharge in may of natural river of 434 m3 s the effective habitat area increased by 70 469 20 m2 with an increase of 53 377 thus the effective habitat area suitable for spawning is in a good condition under the discharge of 74 m3 s 6 conclusion gast model which was obtained by coupling a two dimensional high precision hydrodynamic model with a habitat suitability model was applied to simulate the spawning habitat of gymnocypris eckloni in the lower reaches of a hydropower station in the upper yellow river the main conclusions are as follows i river2d model and gast model were used to simulate the weighted available area of gymnocypris eckloni spawning habitat under different discharges in the study area in the case of water depth velocity and the substrate it was shown that gast model could well evaluate the habitat extension of fish habitat combined with the results of river2d model ii based on the relationship between the weighted available area of spawning habitat and the discharge the effective habitat area began to increase with the increasing of the discharge and when it reached the peak the effective habitat area began to decrease with the increasing of the discharge thus the effective habitat area suitable for spawning ground reached the maximum at the discharge was 74 m3 s iii the average annual discharge of natural river 434 m3 s in may the average annual discharge of normal 392 8 m3 s and dry years 352 7 m3 s in may and and the proposed minimum discharge 74 m3 s were considered to further determine the reasonable discharged flow of hydropower station compared with the discharge in may of natural river of 434 m3 s under the discharge of 74 m3 s the effective habitat area increased by 70 469 20 m2 with an increase of 53 377 it is far more significant than the increase under the discharges of 392 8 m3 s and 352 7 m3 s from this indicated that the effective habitat area suitable for spawning is in a good condition under the discharge of 74 m3 s with considering water depth velocity and the substrate as the main habitat factors thus the discharge of 74 m3 s was selected to the reasonable discharged flow of hydropower

meanwhile the introduction of gpu acceleration technology greatly improves the simulation efficiency combined with the results of river2d the results of this model have good accuracy the model was

provides a scientific basis for protecting the integrity of river ecosystem in this paper graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords high precision hydrodynamic model habitat suitability model weighted usable area discharged flow habitat suitability index 1 introduction the construction of a large number of water conservancy projects not only ensures the reasonable allocation of water resources but also plays a role in other benefits thus becoming the basic guarantee for the sustainable and healthy development of the economy and society mao and dai 2016 however rivers are also the natural space for the survival of various aquatic organisms cheng 2008 with the increasing utilization of river water resources water ecological problems are gradually emerging the construction of reservoirs lead to the changes in river hydrological regime sharp decrease in biodiversity and degradation of local ecological functions foulger and petts 1984 pringle 2003 caissie 2006 meanwhile dams block the passage of migratory fish affecting the communication between species in addition the rapid change of river level also causes the alternating exposure and inundation of shoals which affects the habitat and spawning of fish zhang 2017 li et al 2013 ma et al 2020 to alleviate the stress of water conservancy project on river ecosystem people have taken a series of the measures of reservoir ecological operation and river ecological restoration the united states was the first to put forward the concept of eco environmental water flow requirement in the 1870 s which stipulated that in order to avoid river ecosystem degradation rivers should maintain the minimum ecological flow covich 1993 xu et al 2004 a large number of calculation methods emerged including hydrology methods such as 7q10 tennant and basic flow method et al hydraulic methods such as wetted perimeter method and r2 cross and habitat modeling simulation method such as instream flow incremental methodology tennant 1976 palau and alcazar 1996 gippel and stewardson 1998 tarme 2003 bovee 1982 habitat model simulation methods are also most widely used methods in the world instream flow incremental methodology ifim was the earliest applied method among which to evaluate the impact of the discharge changes on fish habitat so as to improve ecological environment by regulating discharge bovee 1982 rhomas 1998 with the proposal of habitat suitability index hsi it had been applied in more than 80 of the global habitat models yi et al 2010 to determine the relationship between indicative target species and habitat factors bockelmann et al 2004 a one dimensional physical habitat simulation model phabsim based on ifim uses this index to simulate the quantitative relationship between discharge and suitable habitat area stalnaker et al 1995 mark 2010 since the accuracy of habitat factors is very important for the simulation of the river ecological environment more accurately and the evaluation the quality of aquatic habitats more and more hydraulic models have been introduced in particular the two dimensional hydrodynamic model can accurately simulate the river hydrodynamic characteristics and fish habitat among which the two dimensional finite element habitat model river2d with average depth is widely adopted steffler and blackburn 2002 naderi 2021 however due to the lack of professional maintenance of river2d complicated operation low accuracy of terrain processing and the phenomenon of flashback often occurs in the simulation in recent years scholars have introduced the complex and accurate two dimensional or three dimensional fluid dynamics models delft3d mike21 ssiim model etc coupled with habitat suitability models to continuously improve the spatial and temporal resolution of river channel variables olsen and stokseth 1995 li and xia 2011 belgiorno et al 2013 but for the large scale and complex flow pattern of rivers these models still have the shortcomings of insufficient simulation accuracy and long simulation time so the two dimensional high precision hydrodynamic model is coupled with habitat suitability model namely gast model gpu accelerated surface water flow and transport model to evaluate the habitat quality of single or multi species aquatic organisms in gast model finite volume method fvm with godunov type is adopted to simulate two dimensional hydrodynamic process which has good robustness and second order temporal and spatial accuracy to acquire more accurate habitat factor values and the introduction of gpu acceleration technology greatly improves the simulation efficiency in terms of simulating the hydrodynamic process compared with mike21 fm model the calculation efficiency is improved by 1 06 to 2 37 times and the calculation accuracy of 5 m accuracy terrain is improved by 1 07 to 9 56 times in simulating complex flow patterns based on gast model hou and li 2018 in addition most models built are cpu based gast model can improve the simulation computing efficiency by 23 88 to 158 72 times by using gpu acceleration technology compared with cpu technology gong and hou 2020 based on this habitat suitability model used habitat suitability index was coupled which makes the model a more powerful tool for evaluating habitat quality in this paper gast model was obtained by coupling a two dimensional high precision hydrodynamic model with a habitat suitability model firstly the basic governing equations and numerical solutions of this model were described and gpu acceleration technology was introduced to greatly improve the simulation efficiency secondly the lower reach of a proposed hydropower station in the upper yellow river was taken as the research object and gymnocypris eckloni was selected as the target fish the effective spawning habitat of fish under various flow conditions was simulated based on this model besides the results were validated with that from river2d model ultimately the minimum discharge required for the spawning habitat of gymnocypris eckloni downstream of the proposed hydropower station to be in good condition was determined 2 gast model 2 1 hydrodynamic model the basic governing equations of the surface hydrodynamic model adopted in this model are the planar 2d shallow water equations swes hou et al 2014 which is derived directly from hydrodynamic physical process or simplified from three dimensional navier stokes n s equations it is widely used in the hydrodynamic simulations of various hydraulic engineering and other engineering hou et al 2013b to describe a large range of flow hydrodynamics with a much larger horizontal dimension than the direction along water depth liang et al 2016 based on the conservation of mass and momentum assuming that the hydrostatic pressure distribution is followed and the kinematic viscous term turbulent viscous term wind stress and coriolis force are ignored the 2d shallow water equations swes in a matrix form

when a certain habitat factor is unfavorable eq 6 represents csi is determined by the most unsuitable habitat factor among three habitat factors in this paper only three habitat factors were considered namely water depth discharge and the substrate if any of the selected habitat factors were not unsuitable the habitat of organisms would be greatly affected thus from the perspective of the most unfavorable habitat factors eq 6 was adopted in this paper to obtain the comprehensive suitability index 3 numerical solution method 3 1 numerical solution of hydrodynamic model in solving two

reach gymnocypris eckloni was selected as a target fish for aquatic organisms and its habitat distribution during the main spawning period may was studied to reflect the habitat conditions of the river the average annual discharge of natural river in may was 434 m3 s during the operation of hydropower station the average annual discharge of normal 392 8 m3 s and dry years 352 7 m3 s in may should be considered as the discharged flow of hydropower station to ensure the fish breeding in the downstream channel in addition the minimum discharge of the river reach under the dam should be no

water depths obtained by gast model under high resolution terrain conditions 5 results and analysis 5 1 distribution of water depth and velocity according to the relationship between the weighted available area of gymnocypris eckloni spawning habitat and the discharges the weighted available area reaches the maximum when the the discharge was 74 m3 s therefore the average annual discharge of natural river 434 m3 s in may the average annual discharge of normal 392 8 m3 s and dry years 352 7 m3 s in may and and the proposed minimum discharge of 74 m3 s was considered to further determine the reasonable discharged flow of hydropower station the high precision two dimensional hydrodynamic model gast model was adopted to simulate the distribution of water depth and flow velocity in the study area the study reach was divided into 404 544 rectangular grids with a cellsize of 5m using argis software to generate high precision terrain files for gast models the distribution of water depth and flow velocity was shown in figure 7 based on the simulation results of water depth and velocity under different discharges the average water depth and velocity increased significantly when the discharge increased from 74 m3 s to 352 7 m3 s while there was little difference between 352 7 m3 s 392 8 m3 s and 434 m3 s when the discharge was 74 m3 s the average water depth was about 1 20 m and the average velocity was about 0 38 m s while the discharge was 434 m3 s the average water depth was about 2 31 m and the average velocity was about 0 59 m s it could thus be seen that the average water depth was about 48 05 of the natural may 434 m3 s and the average velocity was about 35 59 of that when the discharge was 74 m3 s 5 2 combined habitat suitable index due to the substrate condition of this river reach is sand and gravel mixed with sediment it meets the substrate condition of gymnocypris eckloni spawning the habitat suitable index of the substrate in this river reach is 1 based on the simulation results of three hydraulic factors namely water depth velocity and substrate a combined habitat suitability index csi was obtained by coupling fish habitat simulation method to reflect the habitat distribution of gymnocypris eckloni during spawning period the distribution of it was shown in figure 8 it could be seen that the spawning habitat area increased when the discharge decreased from 434 m3 s to 74 m3 s and the distribution location shifted from two banks to the center of river in figure 6 a under the average annual discharge in may of natural river of 434 m3 s the spawning habitats were mainly distributed on both sides of river and the spawning sites were more concentrated at the bend of river in figure 6 b and c under the discharge in may of normal year of 392 8 m3 s and the discharge in may of normal year of 352 7 m3 s the spawning habitats distribution were consistent with figure 6 a there was not much difference between them in figure 6 d under the proposed minimum discharge of 74 m3 s the spawning habitats shifted to the center of river mainly distributed in the center of river which caused this change was that study river reach belonged to a wide and shallow one most of river sections had broad and flat undersides with the decreasing of river discharge the water depth velocity and cross section width decreased as a result the effective habitat area in the original suitable area for spawning decreased and the central area of river changed from the original unsuitable area to the suitable area meanwhile the weighted usable area wua of spawning habitat of gymnocypris eckloni were calculated under different discharges the wua was 132 022 88 m2 under the average annual discharge in may of natural river of 434 m3 s after the operation of hydropower station the wua was 136 627 75 m2 143 027 48 m2 and 202 492 08 m2 under the discharge in may of normal year of 392 8 m3 s under the discharge in may of dry year of 352 7 m3 s and the proposed minimum discharge of 74 m3 s respectively compared with in may of natural river the effective habitat area in may of normal year and in may of dry year with an increase of 3 488 and 8 335 respectively while e proposed minimum discharge of 74 m3 s with an increase of 53 377 to sum up if the discharge of 392 8 m3 s or 352 7 m3 s is taken as the minimum ecological discharge the increase of effective habitat area was not significant but the discharge of 74 m3 s is selected as the minimum ecological discharge the effective habitat area increased significantly compared with the discharge in may of natural river of 434 m3 s the effective habitat area increased by 70 469 20 m2 with an increase of 53 377 thus the effective habitat area suitable for spawning is in a good condition under the discharge of 74 m3 s 6 conclusion gast model which was obtained by coupling a two dimensional high precision hydrodynamic model with a habitat suitability model was applied to simulate the spawning habitat of gymnocypris eckloni in the lower reaches of a hydropower station in the upper yellow river the main conclusions are as follows i river2d model and gast model were used to simulate the weighted available area of gymnocypris eckloni spawning habitat under different discharges in the study area in the case of water depth velocity and the substrate it was shown that gast model could well evaluate the habitat extension of fish habitat combined with the results of river2d model ii based on the relationship between the weighted available area of spawning habitat and the discharge the effective habitat area began to increase with the increasing of the discharge and when it reached the peak the effective habitat area began to decrease with the increasing of the discharge thus the effective habitat area suitable for spawning ground reached the maximum at the discharge was 74 m3 s iii the average annual discharge of natural river 434 m3 s in may the average annual discharge of normal 392 8 m3 s and dry years 352 7 m3 s in may and and the proposed minimum discharge 74 m3 s were considered to further determine the reasonable discharged flow of hydropower station compared with the discharge in may of natural river of 434 m3 s under the discharge of 74 m3 s the effective habitat area increased by 70 469 20 m2 with an increase of 53 377 it is far more significant than the increase under the discharges of 392 8 m3 s and 352 7 m3 s from this indicated that the effective habitat area suitable for spawning is in a good condition under the discharge of 74 m3 s with considering water depth velocity and the substrate as the main habitat factors thus the discharge of 74 m3 s was selected to the reasonable discharged flow of hydropower

24528,rapid economic growth and social development in china have led to serious water pollution problems and water resource shortages limiting the sustainable and coordinated development that could support both the socio economy and water environment we however the spatial heterogeneity and evolutionary characteristics of the coordination between economic development ed and we have not been adequately explored in china s provinces in this study we use the spatial global local autocorrelation and geographically weighted regression gwr model to explore the relationship between ed and we subsystems and its influencing factors in china s provinces from 2010 to 2019 the main results are as follows a the coupling coordination degree ccd between the two subsystems in southern china is higher than that of northern china transitional development areas have gradually spread to the middle of china and there has been an increase trend in the number of moderate and high coordination provinces b the ed led we lags behind ed type is mainly concentrated in central and eastern china and the we led ed lags behind we type is concentrated in the northeastern and western regions the areas with synchronous development are relatively small in number and are mainly concentrated in east coastal china c there is an obvious spatial dependence of the coordination between ed and we from the perspective of global correlation but this dependence is weakened with increasing geographical distance the local mode of agglomeration shows a trend towards the evolution of high high clustering in the eastern region d the gwr analysis indicates that the factors of population density energy consumption fixed investment and research and development r d expenditure significantly influence the coordination between ed and we fixed investment and r d expenditure are mainly positive driving factors while the impacts of population density and energy consumption vary among different regions as time evolves changes in driving force in a region can extend spatial effects to adjacent regions through the spatial transmission mechanism finally we close the paper by recommending the different

policy implemented in 1978 china has experienced the rapid economic growth and made remarkable achievement in various construction projects china s share of the world gross domestic production gdp

al 2013 however with rapid increases in the population density and industrialization the water environment we faces tremendous challenges from pollution discharge and water overexploitation and becomes an important bottleneck in china s sustainable economic development zhao et al 2017 han et al 2014 karaouzas et al 2018 based on data from 5100 groundwater quality monitoring points in the country 51 8 and 14 8 of china s regions have poor or extremely poor water quality respectively also nearly two thirds of the groundwater is significantly deteriorated or has unqualified quality china s ecological environment bulletin 2017 some water related environmental problems such as the long term water resource shortages the rapid deterioration of water quality and the degeneration of aquatic ecosystems have significantly limited the healthy and sustainable socio economy growth isik et al 2019 aljerf et al 2018 inthasaro et al 2016 in general the intensity and scale of socio economic development should not exceed a certain threshold of we in a specific region jia et al 2018 wang et al 2019 identifying methods to effectively alleviate the conflict between the economic development ed and we to realize their coordinated development has emerged as a topic of great concern in regionally sustainable development in china fang et al 2019 however it is difficult to quantitatively estimate the interactions between socio economic development and we due to their complexity among the elements in these systems han et al 2017 originating from the field of physics coupling is defined as two or more systems interact with each other to achieve a degree of synergy wang et al 2013 cui et al 2019 he et al 2017 this concept has been successfully applied in the field of environmental science such as the socio economic development and environment response cui et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 ge et al 2016 coordination namely a sound interaction among different sectors of a system can be further used to measure the sustainable development of an investigated system fang et al 2016 joore et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 together the combination forms the coupling coordination degree ccd which is a comprehensive index measuring the harmony between development and evolution in a system the ccd model reveals the level of disorder or order from uncoordinated to the orderly coordination of the development trend in this respect some scholars have explored the relationship in human environment or social ecological system accounting for some problems related to rapid ed and environmental degradation in urban areas folke et al 2005 guan et al 2011 shao et al 2014 and coordination degree between socio economic and ecological environment system kunz et al 2013 fang et al 2016 subsequently some scholars have studied the relationship among ecology economy energy environment and resource management such as society ecology tanga et al 2013 leslie et al 2019 urbanization environment wang et al 2014 liu et al 2018 economy resource environment zhang et al 2016 economy energy environment zuo et al 2017 population economy environment zhang et al 2008 as well as social economy and water environmental quality liu et al 2020 all these works indicate that the ccd model is an effective way to evaluate the sustainable development in a regional economy environment nexus in china studies have also focused on water resources at different scales including water resource carrying capacity and water efficiency in terms of water resource carrying capacity bu et al 2020 constructed an index system of urban water ecological carrying capacity wang et al 2017 performed a dynamic analysis of the carrying capacity of water resources in the wetlands region of beijing yang et al 2019 constructed a multi index evaluation system to assess the water resource carrying capacity of xi an in china using an analytic hierarchy process model to study problems related to water efficiency the environmental kuznets curve ekc model was applied to examine the interaction between water efficiency and ed in china from 1999 to 2014 different from the ekc theory some related works have discussed the coupling mechanism of economic growth and we protection ke et al 2016 industry improvements and water resource efficiency zhang et al 2013 water resource and employment in agriculture and industry sectors davijani et al 2016 recently many scholars tried to reveal the coordination and spatial correlation between the socio economic development and water resource environmental quality for instance sun et al 2020 employed social network analysis sna to study spatial distribution characteristics of water resource efficiency in china and found significant regional differences in water sources liu et al 2020 constructed a comprehensive index system to study the coordination between socio economy and we subsystems in the nansi lake catchment in china tan et al 2019 examined the change trend in the ccd between water resource environment and socio economy development in jiangsu province of china cui et al 2020 introduced an integrated approach to predict the ccd between social economy and we on an urban scale for kunming city during 2016 2025 zhang et al 2021 used logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi method to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution and driving factors of wastewater treatment efficiency in the context of china s river chief system base on the tobit model zhang et al 2020 explored the factors influencing industrial water efficiency and found that water resource endowment technological innovation water structure and environmental regulations positively impact industrial water efficiency while industrial structure and urbanization are negatively related to the efficiency at present there are some deficiencies in the existing research summarized as follows first most of studies have only explored water efficiency at a sector level rather than investigate the overall level of the water resource environment second most of studies are only one sided or city based with less thinking a regional relationship between socio economy and we in china third previous researchers have performed a unilateral evaluation of water resource carrying capacity water use efficiency and driving factors but have not provided a unified framework in particular few quantitative works examine the driving mechanism and dynamic evolution characteristics of the ccd from the space time perspective thus it is necessary to comprehensively evaluate the coordination between ed and we subsystems and clarify the factors influencing the ccd from a spatiotemporal perspective in china s provinces the objectives of this study mainly include i constructing the ccd model to study the coordination between ed and we subsystems in china ii employing the spatial autocorrelation model to explore the clustering spatial association and spatial dynamics for the ccd in different regions iii introducing a geographically weighted regression gwr model to clarify the main factors influencing the ccd and its spatiotemporal distribution characteristics at a provincial level and iv proposing recommendations for improving water resource and environment and formulating sustainable water management policies in china it is expected that the results of this study can be helpful to water environmental protection and management of water resources in china and the decision making of chinese government under high quality development the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the methodology and data and introduce the mechanism of coupling between ed and we subsystems section 3 provides results and discussion of the regional distribution and spatial dynamics of the ccd as well as driving factors influencing the ccd based on gwr model the main conclusions policy implications and limitations of this paper are then presented in section 4 2 methodology and data 2 1 study area as the world s largest developing country china has the fastest growing major economy in the world with growth rate averaging 10 over the past 30 years however disparity among the development of its regions has widened in the past since the reform and opening up policy in 1978 china has 34 provincial level administration regions of which 30 except tibet hong kong macau and taiwan are studied in this work these 30 provincial level administration regions can be divided into four groups namely eastern central western and northeastern regions the eastern region comprises 10 administrative areas including three out of the four municipalities in china namely beijing shanghai and tianjin the other seven administrative areas include fujian guangdong hainan hebei jiangsu shandong and zhejiang provinces the northeastern region includes heilongjiang jilin and liaoning whereas the central region includes anhui henan hubei hunan jiangxi and shanxi provinces the western region includes four autonomous regions one municipality i e chongqing and six provinces the autonomous regions are guangxi inner mongolia ningxia and xinjiang and the provinces are gansu guizhou qinghai shaanxi sichuan and yunnan 2 2 constructing an indicator system the economic system refers mainly to a man made system constructed through human activity while the water environmental subsystem refers to a natural system golubiewski et al 2012 fang et al 2016 the evolution of each subsystem is conditioned by the structure and function of the other wang et al 2018 kennedy et al 2011 so the coupling degree between ed and we can be viewed as an effect feedback framework which is vital to realize high quality development an effective evaluation indicator system should comprehensively and verifiably reflect all aspects of ed and we subsystems in this respect ginevicius et al 2006 constructed a complex index of socio economic development using more than six factors liu et al 2018 established a socio economic index using four factors including industrial structure economic scale business climate and external communications as for we indicator liu et al 2020 constructed a comprehensive index system of we subsystem in the nansi lake catchment cui et al 2020 constructed the we index to examine the interaction of socio economy and we in kunming of china based on the principles of scientificity rationality operability and representativeness we selected 26 indices to evaluate ed and we subsystems in china s 30 provinces taiwan hong kong tibet and macao were not considered due to the limited data here the we index follows the pressure state response psr framework which is first proposed by canadian scholars d rapport and t friend oecd 1993 and then is used to study eco environmental issues pissourios et al 2013 wang et al 2013 this model emphasizes the relationship between environmental pressure and degradation which can influence the entire decision making process water environmental pressure in psr model refers to the load brought by human activities or natural factors on water environmental security which generally results in unstable coupling state of ed and we subsystems thus we select per capita water consumption water consumption per 10000 yuan of gdp proportion of industrial and agricultural water consumption sewage discharge and chemical oxygen demand per ton to quantify water environmental pressure the state of we indicates the status and change of water resource and environment under the pressure which are represented as four aspects average annual precipitation per capita water resources water qualification rate of water functional area and water resource utilization rate the effect of water environmental quality indicates the response of government social organizations and related groups to the protection of water environment in the face of the realistic state of the environment response index is composed of urban water penetration rate industrial water reuse rate farmland effective irrigation rate urban sewage treatment rate and investment proportion of wastewater treatment to gdp which are used to measure the human effort on water pollution abatement as for the ed index system we select three dimensions namely economic scale economic structure and economic vitality the economic scale includes four indicators gdp per capita comprehensively reflects regional economic scale and wealth per capita disposable income and net income of rural residents reflects the regional consumption capacity from the perspective of expenditures per capita investment in fixed assets reflects the ability to improve material and cultural life as regards as economic structure proportion of primary and tertiary industry is an important index and is directly related to the growth potential and competitiveness of the region economy proportion of government financial expenditure to gdp reflects the power source of economic growth and measures the sustainability of regional economic growth rural engel coefficient reflects the living standard of the grass roots people in the region from the proportion of farmers food expenditures the economic vitality includes three indicators gdp growth rate is selected to reflect the economic growth rate while the social labor productivity and per capita retail sales of consumer goods reflects the vitality of economic growth the coupling coordination evaluation index system of the integrated system of water environment and economic development in china is shown in table 1 2 3 data source and a pre processing the data used in this study were mainly derived from china statistical yearbook http www stats gov cn tjsj ndsj china statistical yearbook on environment http tongji cnki net kns55 navi homepage aspx id 2011010074 name yhjsd floor 1 ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china http www mwr gov cn sj tjgb and china city statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics 2010 2019 individual missing values were extrapolated based on the average annual growth rate to eliminate difference in dimension magnitude and sign between indicators the raw data were standardized using the extreme value processing method li et al 2012 expressed as 1 x i j x i j m i n x 1 j x n j m a x x 1 j x n j m i n x 1 j x n j 2 x i j m a x x 1 j x n j x i j m a x x 1 j x n j m i n x 1 j x n j in eqs 1 and 2 x i j represents the value of the jth indicator in the region i i 1 n j 1 m m i n x 1 j x n j and m a x x 1 j x n j are the minimum and maximum values of indicator x i j respectively the variable x i j refers to the positive dimension value while x i j is the negative dimension indicator all the values for indicator x j are normalized into the categories of 0 1 2 4 the coupling coordination degree model to reveal the coordination between ed and we subsystems we applied the entropy value method to measure the sample index weight p i j as follows 3 p i j x i j i 1 n x i j here n is the total number of samples by using eq 3 we can obtain the entropy of the jth indicator 4 e j k i 1 m p i j l n p i j where the constant variable k is related to the sample number n and is estimated using k 1 ln n with 0 e 1 the informational entropy weight w j is thus expressed as follows 5 w j 1 e j i 1 m 1 e j then we calculate the comprehensive score of each program expressed as 6 z i j i 1 j 1 m n x i j o r x i j w j subsequently the degree of coupling between ed and we subsystems is obtained using formula 7 7 c u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 2 1 2 in this expression c represents the degree of coupling and u 1 and u 2 represent the comprehensive evaluation index of ed and we subsystems respectively in general the coupling degree model demonstrates the strength of the interaction but does not reflect the level of coordinated development of a system based on the relevant research the ccd model between the two subsystems was determined by eqs 8 and 9 expressed as 8 d c t 1 2 9 t α u 1 β u 2 here d represents the coupling coordination degree t represents the comprehensive evaluation index of ed and we subsystems the α and β represent ed and we in the whole weight system respectively determined by α β 0 5 to more accurately determine the degree of coordination between ed and we subsystems the ccd is classified using the uniform distribution function method as listed in table 2 2 5 spatial autocorrelation model the spatial autocorrelation method is mainly used to explore the spatial distribution of researched objects and refers to whether the attributed values of adjacent regions within a research area are related or independent moran 1950 in this model the spatial distribution pattern could be evaluated by moran s i index p value and z scores and these three indicators determine whether the pattern is clustered dispersed or random the p value is the probability that the observed variables present to a random pattern while the z score is the standard deviation and both the z scores and p values are associated with the standard normal distribution the global moran s i reflects the overall correlation between regions which can be expressed as follows 10 m o r a n s i i 1 m i 1 m i i d i d d i d s 2 i 1 m i 1 m i i where m is the total number of regions and i i is the spatial weight e g for provinces i and i if both i and i are adjacent then i i 1 if they are not adjacent then i i 0 the variables d i and d i are the coordination values of i and i respectively expressed as follows 11 d 1 m i 1 m d i s 2 1 m i 1 m d i d 2 in general moran s i value belongs to the set 1 1 indicating that the attribute values of different regions are spatially dependent which is a positive correlation the local indicator of spatial association lisa was used to analyze the lst spatial aggregation as follows 12 l o c a l m o r a n s i d i d s 2 i i i i d 11 here the local spatial correlations are described using the moran s i scatter plot four cluster types are defined based on lisa results that is for ed and we subsystems the types refers to high high h h low low l l high low h l and low high l h liu et al 2019 2 6 gwr model the ordinary least squares ols model was generally applied in different regions with relevant influencing factors however this kind of relationship is assumed to not vary across different spatial positions and does not provide practical and meaningful reference results according to the first law of geography state there are more similarities between adjacent geographical entities tobler et al 1970 as such the gwr model which allows parameters to be locally estimated is better than ols model this model is expressed as follows fotheringham et al 1996 duo et al 2016 cao et al 2018 13 y i β 0 μ i v i k β k μ i v i x i k ε i where y i is the dependent variable x i k is the explanatory variables of an n n matrix μ i v i is a function of location β 0 is the constant term of regression β k is the parameter vector to be estimated and ε i is the random error term gwr model uses a distance decay function to determine the scope of spatial dependence the akaike information criterion aic and kernel density estimation are used to determine the appropriate bandwidth and parameters as such the gaussian function is expressed as follows 14 w i j e x p d i j b 2 where d i j is the distance between i and j and b is the kernel bandwidth additionally the international community uses the cross validation cv method proposed by bowman et al 1984 to measure regression coefficients when bandwidth is determined the function between b and cv is expressed as follows 15 c v i 1 n y i y i b 2 where y i is the estimated value of y i when cv reaches its minimum level considering that a different weight method can result in a different bandwidth aic is selected in this study as the calculation criterion 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of the ed and we index system using the index system constructed above we evaluate the weights of each indicator in china s 30 provinces from 2010 to 2019 as listed in table 1 the analysis of ed index mainly includes three primary indicators ranked in descending order of weight as follows economic scale 47 96 economic vitality 32 63 and economic structure 20 42 obviously the economic scale plays a main role in influencing ed whereas the effect of economic structure is relatively small for the secondary index of ed three factors are the most important in determining the high quality development per capita retail sales of consumer goods 15 12 social labor productivity 14 26 and gdp per capita 13 39 here per capita disposable income of urban residents 12 41 and per capita net income of rural residents 12 12 are important factors to ed these findings of this study are consistent with that of socio economic index of chinese provincial capital cities fan et al 2019 thus the policymakers should focus more on the economic and industrial structures when implementing a new high quality development plan in china in terms of we quality there is a major difference between the primary indicators as listed in table 1 the three primary indicators are ranked in descending order of weight as follows state 60 34 response 27 43 and pressure 12 42 the state index plays the most important role in improving we quality with respect to criteria layer three factors of indicator layer are main factors to influencing the we per capita water resources 34 39 average annual precipitation 18 32 and farmland effective irrigation rate 15 67 it is noteworthy that the agricultural indicator has the greatest effect of all indexes from indicator layer emphasizing the importance of protecting agricultural water environment as china is undergoing a period of high quality development the demand for water resources has increased dramatically this finding also suggests that chinese government should pay significant attention to protecting water resources and abating water environmental pollution 3 2 the temporal characteristics of coupling coordination degree in china s provinces the index systems for both ed and we at a province scale are standardized in the range of 0 1 then the degree of coordination between ed and we subsystems is measured by using eqs 8 and 9 figure 1 shows the ccd of the four regions in china from 2010 to 2019 which reflects the coordination level of each region with the exception of fluctuations in individual years the coordination degree between the two subsystems was consistently optimized and steadily increased but the gap between the ccd of each region doesn t change significantly the change trend of the ccd from high to low is in the order of east west central and northeast i e the east has the highest ccd followed by west central and northeast obviously the regional distribution of the coupling coordination state is similar with the relationship of urbanization and eco environment in china except for some differences in the central and western regions liu et al 2018 another prominent finding was that during the research periods of 2010 2012 the ccd of the four regions is in the range from 0 4 to 0 6 reflecting a transitional development state the eastern region has a higher ccd reaching 0 75 in 2019 and mainly remains in a moderate coordination state for the central and western regions the ccd remains in a transitional development state with an obvious transition from near imbalance to basic coordination in 2013 these findings are similar with change trend of the ccd between socio economy and ecological environment in provincial capital cities fan et al 2019 we also note that the ccd of northeast china is the lowest and remains in an imbalanced state all these results can be explained as follows high quality ed level are mainly concentrated in eastern china which has rich natural resources dense populations advanced technology and convenient transportation these factors provide the adequate labor and material bases to support more mature environment protection thus this facilitates the coordinated development between ed and we subsystems in comparison the central and western regions generally lack advanced industrial technology human resources and financial support the economy of western china is rather underdeveloped and mainly relies on enterprises that generate high levels of pollution and consume high amounts of water to support its socio economic development in these regions the pursuit of economic benefits is one sided and does not consider we protection making the coordination between ed and we relatively low in short the ccd in china s provinces is not high indicating necessary for the improvements of coordination development between ed and we subsystems 3 3 the spatial characteristics of coupling coordination degree in this work we diveded the degree of coordination into six levels and were visualized with gis to reveal the spatial distribution in china s provinces as can be seen from table 2 and fig 2 most of china s provinces are in the transition development state including 17 provinces that are close to being imbalanced i e xinjiang jilin liaoning inner mongolia hebei shanxi shannxi henan shandong anhui hubei chongqing sichuan guizhou yunnan and guangxi and 8 provinces that achieve the basic coordination i e qinghai jiangsu tianjing shanghai hunan jiangxi guangdong hainan in contrast a small number of provinces are located in a moderate level of coordination including beijing fujian and zhejiang after 10 years development the ccd of most provinces in china is consistently increasing in particular three provinces i e beijing shanghai and zhejiang exceed 0 8 in 2019 thereby reaching a high level coordination these provinces are mainly concentrated in the developed eastern regions interestingly the spatial distribution of the coordination degree in 2019 is consistent with that of low carbon development and urbanization in china provinces song et 2018 in addition although most of the provinces have a near imbalance of the ccd in 2010 the number decreases significantly with time and all of them changes to a balanced development during 2016 2019 the spatial distribution of provinces with a basic coordinated state is mainly concentrated in northern china including xinjiang inner mongolia ningxia gansu heilongjiang jilin liaoning hebei shanxi henan and guizhou which may be related to lower wastewater treatment efficiency in these provinces zhang et al 2021 we also find a clear increase in the number of provinces with moderate coordination levels in 2019 and mostly concentrated in southern china however these areas change to a nearly imbalanced state during 2013 2016 by the end of the study period most provinces in western and northeastern china are in a transitional development state indicating that the development of the coordination between ed and we subsystems is relatively low in developing areas 3 4 the subtype of the coupling coordination degree in china s provinces to identify the effect of ed and we on the coordination at a provincial scale we further explore the main class of the ccd to show the interaction mechanism between ed and we here the ccd is divided into three types ed led we lags behind ed synchronous development and we led ed lags behind we as shown in table 1 we find that the spatial distribution of the three different ccd types is sensitive to the investigated regions most of the ed led subtypes are concentrated in eastern china while the we led types are in the central and western china during 2010 2013 as a matter of fact some previous studies have obtained similar results including xi an zhao et al 2012 zhuhai yang et al 2013 and wuhan ding et al 2015 these findings indicate that in the early stage of economic growth many regions or cities sacrifice the environment quality to promote urbanization and the eco environment constraints on urbanization always has a lag effect after 10 years of development the number of provinces with we led subtype decreases to 9 provinces including xinjiang qinghai guansu sichuan guizhou guangxi yunnan fujian and hainan however the wd led subtype becomes the main class of the ccd in most regions that is the number of ed led type has been increasing with a minimum ratio higher than 62 83 additionally the we led regions are mainly located in a transitional development state while the ed led type corresponds to a high coordination state in comparison the provinces with synchronization development mainly concentrated in the eastern coastal provinces of zhejiang guangdong and liaoning there are few regions achieving synchronization development by the end of the study period which indicates these regions are not coordinated with respect to ed and we protection 3 5 spatial dependency characteristics of the ccd before establishing the gwr model we use moran s i to explore whether there is a spatial autocorrelation of the ccd in china s 30 provinces table 3 presents the calculated moran s i value of the degree of interregional coordination from 2010 to 2019 where moran s i value belongs to 1 1 the moran s i values of the global spatial correlation coefficient are significant from 2010 to 2019 indicating the ccd has a positive spatial agglomeration that is provinces with a high ccd tended to be adjacent to other provinces with high ccd values while provinces with a low ccd level tended to be associated with those with low ccd values all the p values are less than 0 01 which denies the result of random spatial distribution pattern the z scores are also higher than 2 32 which provide the significant evidence of spatial autocorrelation additionally the global moran s i index of the ccd gradually changes from 0 292 to 0 377 showing a steady spatial agglomeration effect to further analyze the coordination characteristics at the different surrounding regions we calculate the local moran s i scatter plots of the ccd we find a certain spatial limitation to the geographical spillover effect of the ccd i e the spillover effect decreases significantly when increasing the spatial distance the moran s i scatter plots of spatial clustering mode during 2010 2019 and the agglomeration type of each province are summarized according to the graphs as shown in fig 3 and table 4 the main results are as follows i in 2010 10 provinces are concentrated in the first quadrant marked h h i e beijing fujian guangdong hainan hunan jiangsu jiangxi tianjin and zhejiang the ccd of eastern china is high and the gaps between adjacent regions are relatively small indicating a strong spatial correlation ii five provinces i e anhui guangxi gansu hubei and shandong are included in the second quadrant of l h showing the heterogeneous characteristics with the adjacent regions iii there are 13 provinces in the third quadrant marked l l mainly concentrating in the central and western regions i e guizhou hebei henan heilongjiang jilin liaoning inner mongolia ningxia shanxi shaanxi sichuan yunnan and chongqing iv the least number of provinces are located in the fourth quadrant and includes western xinjiang and qinghai the ccd is higher than that of the adjacent coordination provinces after 10 years development the number of provinces with the h h agglomeration increases by 2 with the addition of jiangsu and guangxi the number of provinces with the l h agglomeration reaches 5 with hainan included and hubei remaining unchanged as for the l l agglomeration mode there is an obvious increase in the number of provinces and reaching up to 14 with the addition of xinjiang however qinghai is stabilized at the h l mode in 2019 in short the regions in the h h and l l agglomeration modes occupy most of the provinces in china which is independent of the time variations from the perspective of spatial distribution the cluster mode of the ccd continually shifts towards the h h cluster mode especially in central china under this circumstance the regional differences narrow in central china forming a spatial agglomeration pattern supporting the coordinated development between ed and we 3 6 influencing factors of the ccd based on gwr model the gwr model was constructed by setting the ccd as the dependent variable and population density x 1 energy consumption x 2 fixed investment x 3 and r d expenditures x 4 as the independent variables here the r2 and adjusted r2 reflect the degree of model fit and the residual sum of squares rss reflects the model accuracy the aicc information represents an important criterion to evaluate the goodness of model fit the smaller the value is the higher the accuracy of gwr model will be tables 5 and 6 present the corresponding parameters used in this study in which three fixed bandwidths of 202 88 and 207 426 are selected for regression however the sigma parameter exhibits significant differences and at a bandwidth of 207 426 the value of sigma parameter increases up to 0 062 with the effect of parameter r2 and adjusted r2 being superior we also find that the value of local coefficients varies from region to region the gwr model simulates the spatial difference in each factor on the spatial distribution of ccd and the regression coefficients of each factor are visualized to analyze the influence on the ccd the population density produces a negative influence on the ccd in china s provinces in 2000 the spatial distribution of local coefficient follows a spatial gradient pattern decreasing gradually from the southeastern to northwestern direction in china the greatest coefficients of population density are concentrated in xinjiang qinghai and gansu with the lowest coefficients in heilongjiang jilin liaoning zhejiang fujian guangdong and hainan fig 4 a after 10 years development there is a significant decrease of the negative impact on ccd but the coefficients in eastern china are smaller compared to those in the central and western regions northeast china i e heilongjiang jilin and liaoning has the largest coefficient followed by jiangsu shanghai and zhejiang which are mainly distributed in eastern china fig 5 a the coefficients of most of the eastern provinces in 2019 are negative indicating that population density hinders the coordinated development between ed and we these results of this study are similar with the negative effects of population density on ecological footprint predicted by gwr in china wu et al 2020 but is different from the impacts of population on air environment in shandong province wang et al 2013 the reason can be attributed to that the areas with the developed economy and high level urbanization i e beijing tianjing shanghai zhejiang and jiangsu are favorable to increasing the number of population the increase of population density leads to a significant pressure on we and is thus negatively related to the ccd however the out flow of human resources in labor exporting provinces such as guizhou and guangxi is prominent which leads to the decrease of urban population density within a specific period of time therefore the impact of population density on the ccd shows a significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity as for the energy consumption factor the gwr analysis shows that it is negatively correlated with the ccd however there are significant differences of the coefficients in the different provinces as shown in figs 4 b and 5 b in 2010 the spatial distribution of the regression coefficient exhibits the spatial aggregation at some extent but no spatial gradient appears the negative effect of energy consumption in five provinces i e qinghai jiangsu shanghai zhejiang and guangdong ranks the highest which are mainly concentrated in eastern china except for qinghai in western china by comparison the coefficient of energy consumption experiences a steady decrease in 2019 and is inconsistent with the china s economic gradient instead it has a greater negative effect on the ccd in southern china these findings are similar with the change trend of the coordination degree between socio economy and ecological environment in provincial capital cities fan et al 2019 additionally the optimization and updating of the industrial structure in developed areas is continuously increasing with the increasing output value of the china s tertiary industry and improvements in urbanization quality the demand for water resources steadily increases therefore decreasing energy consumption may be an effective way to improve the ccd in eastern china however many regions including parts of western and central china i e xinjiang qinghai gansu guangxi shanxi henan anhui and shannxi experience a negative to positive transition for energy consumption factor from 2010 to 2019 this differs from the interaction mechanism between energy consumption and ecology in china s provinces wu et al 2020 the main reason can be attributed to the threshold effect the impact of energy consumption on the ccd is related with water efficiency water consumption structure and technological progress before reaching a threshold where the effect of energy consumption is not significant the industrial structure optimization can improve the we quality as illustrated in 2019 once the threshold is exceeded the energy consumption significantly reduces the ccd consequently the negative impact of energy consumption in these provinces turns into a positive one and increases from 2016 to 2019 under this circumstance the rapid socio economic development in western china improves the coordination degree between ed and we compared to the two factors above the fixed investment is positively correlated with the ccd and the number of positive provinces far exceeds the negative ones figs 4 c and 5 c this indicates that the factor of fixed investment is favorable for improving the ccd we note that this effect is consistent with changes of water resource and environmental carrying capacity of 286 cities in china chen et al 2021 from a spatial distribution perspective in 2010 the greatest coefficients of fixed investment are concentrated in the western qinghai while the lowest coefficients are in the eastern regions including provinces of jiangsu shanghai and liaoning fig 4 c after 10 years development the coefficients of fixed investment decreases along the southeastern direction with a high value locating in the northeastern heilongjiang liaoning jilin as well as the southern guangdong and hainan low values are mainly concentrated in the eastern shandong jiangsu shanghai and zhejiang which is different from the change trend of china s economic gradient as shown in fig 5 c although the fixed investment supports harmonious development in most regions of china the fast track socio economic development is unfavorable for improving of the ccd in the developed southeastern china this is because the implementation of the western development policy and relevant environmental policies leads to increases in fixed investment evenly promotes the coordinated development between ed and we by comparison the industry layout of southeastern china has reached a high level state and the time non stationary is relatively small there is not as much space to greatly improve we level as before thus the we remains stable or even declining slightly however the we will eventually be improved as the progress of urbanization is advanced and water environment related improvement measures are implemented which is consistent with the findings of wang et al 2012 r d expenditure is an important factor influencing the ccd and shows a different transformation between the positive and negative effect in different regions as illustrated in figs 4 d and 5 d generally the increases of r d expenditure can stimulate technological advances in water resource conservation and environmental protection which would improve water efficiency and water structure and further mitigate we crises in china s provinces however this study shows that the r d expenditure is negatively correlated with the ccd during 2010 2016 indicating that the technical changes have a restraining effect on the ccd this differed from our expectation of the relationship between r d expenditure and ccd by comparison this finding is consistent with that of r d expenditure on ecological foot print reported by wu et al 2020 except the western regions show the different characteristics from the perspective of spatial distribution the negative effect is mainly concentrated in five provinces in 2010 including the western qinghai gansu and xinjiang and the eastern guangdong and hainan provinces fig 4 d after 10 years development the spatial distribution of the regression coefficient decreases from the eastern to western regions via a gradient pattern that is the high value and low value areas follows a sequence of east is high and west is low fig 5 d in particular three regions i e xinjiang qinghai and gansu have the largest negative coefficient indicating that the regulation of r d expenditure brings about the water ecological deterioration in western china compared to eastern china due to the tempo spatial differences of the effect of technology on the ccd different regional characteristics and specific circumstances should be considered when introducing new technology furthermore the r d expenditure may have a rebound effect which means that the new technologies and products may increase consumer demand strengthen the effect of technical factors on we and lead to a deterioration of we quality especially in the developed western regions 4 conclusions policy implications and limitations 4 1 conclusions this study established the index evaluation system to estimate the ccd between ed and we the coupling coordination and spatial global local autocorrelation model were applied to examine the characteristics of coordination degree in china s 30 provinces also a gwr model was applied to analyze the impact of population density energy consumption fixed investment and r d expenditure on the ccd from 2010 to 2019 key conclusions are as follows 1 the coordination between the ed and we subsystems shows a spatial distribution pattern of high in south low in north which indicates there has a greater ccd in the south and a lower ccd in the north transitional development areas have gradually spread to the central regions and there has been an increase trend in the number of moderate and high coordination provinces 2 the ed led type is mainly concentrated in central and eastern china while the we led type is concentrated in the northeastern and western regions the areas with synchronous development are relatively small in number and are mainly concentrated in east coastal china 3 there is a spatial dependence of the coordination between ed and we subsystems from the perspective of global correlation and this dependence is weakened with increasing geographical distance the local mode of agglomeration shows a trend towards the evolution of h h clustering in the eastern region 4 the gwr analysis indicates that the factors of population density energy consumption fixed investment and r d expenditure significantly influence the degree of coordination between the ed and we subsystems fixed investment and r d expenditure have a significant promotion effect on improving the ccd while the impacts of population density and energy consumption vary between regions as time evolves changes in the driving force in a region can extend spatial effects to adjacent regions through the spatial transmission mechanism 4 2 policy implications as a main driving factor population density is positively related with the ccd in central and western china and negatively related with ccd in the eastern regions this indicates that the rapid ed did not necessarily support improvement of the ccd governments should continue to deepen reforms of the dual household registration system in urban and rural areas making population density further optimized in the whole country the largest cities such as beijing and shanghai should restrain the inflow of population and avoid reaching a population carrying pressure it cannot support the western areas such as qinghai guizhou inner mongolia gansu and yunnan which experience population losses and low water environmental pressure should implement a population attraction policy to encourage populations to return this would help to achieve a more reasonable distribution and balance of population and water resource and environment in china energy consumption has a significantly negative effect on the ccd in china the government should take active measures to adjust the current industry and consumption structure limit the expansion of high consumption water industries promoting sustainable development efforts should also be made to protect water environment by developing and introducing new technologies to improve water efficiency additionally government should strengthen the cooperation and coordination among the eastern and western regions minimizing the negative impact of the water rebound effect when developing policies fixed investment plays a prominent role in improving the ccd in northeastern northwestern and central china the government should change the concept of ed emphasizing the quality of fixed investment and paying attention to the optimization and adjustment of industrial structure for the eastern regions the current ed model has limited improvements of the ccd so the local government should rationalize the production capacity to advance enterprises with low consumption water non polluting advanced technology and managerial experience in western regions governments should strengthen their oversight of water resource consumption raising the threshold for high polluting enterprises and encouraging provincial environmental cooperation to control the deterioration of water pollution and coordinate pollution abatement r d expenditure plays a more important role in improving the ccd while its suppressing effect on the ed growth is relatively strong in the central and western regions it enhances the improvement of the ccd in eastern and northeastern regions and become a favorable factor for enhancing synchronous development between ed and we to realize the maximum effect of limited technology resources a public investment and incentive policy should be implemented in eastern and northeastern china in the western and central regions local governments should develop their own technology to protect we according to their actual industries this would prevent the western regions from achieving ed at a high cost of water environmental degradation and avoid repeating the development process once followed by the economically developed eastern regions in summary the coefficients of four driving factors show the spatial aggregation to some extent with the gradient based increase or decrease trend which are influenced not only by their own characteristics but also by the surrounding conditions hence the province level synchronization of ed and we requires regional cooperation in different ways meanwhile policymakers should develop the role of market in improving the ccd achieving the overall coordination between ed and we under high quality development 4 3 limitations due to the limitations of data acquisition this study did not consider factors such as climate temperature and environmental flow thus lacks the in depth exploration of process mechanism meanwhile considering that high quality development has become the focus of china s economic growth we should expand the research scale to cover county level administrative regions in order to have more practical guiding

24528,rapid economic growth and social development in china have led to serious water pollution problems and water resource shortages limiting the sustainable and coordinated development that could support both the socio economy and water environment we however the spatial heterogeneity and evolutionary characteristics of the coordination between economic development ed and we have not been adequately explored in china s provinces in this study we use the spatial global local autocorrelation and geographically weighted regression gwr model to explore the relationship between ed and we subsystems and its influencing factors in china s provinces from 2010 to 2019 the main results are as follows a the coupling coordination degree ccd between the two subsystems in southern china is higher than that of northern china transitional development areas have gradually spread to the middle of china and there has been an increase trend in the number of moderate and high coordination provinces b the ed led we lags behind ed type is mainly concentrated in central and eastern china and the we led ed lags behind we type is concentrated in the northeastern and western regions the areas with synchronous development are relatively small in number and are mainly concentrated in east coastal china c there is an obvious spatial dependence of the coordination between ed and we from the perspective of global correlation but this dependence is weakened with increasing geographical distance the local mode of agglomeration shows a trend towards the evolution of high high clustering in the eastern region d the gwr analysis indicates that the factors of population density energy consumption fixed investment and research and development r d expenditure significantly influence the coordination between ed and we fixed investment and r d expenditure are mainly positive driving factors while the impacts of population density and energy consumption vary among different regions as time evolves changes in driving force in a region can extend spatial effects to adjacent regions through the spatial transmission mechanism finally we close the paper by recommending the different

al 2013 however with rapid increases in the population density and industrialization the water environment we faces tremendous challenges from pollution discharge and water overexploitation and becomes an important bottleneck in china s sustainable economic development zhao et al 2017 han et al 2014 karaouzas et al 2018 based on data from 5100 groundwater quality monitoring points in the country 51 8 and 14 8 of china s regions have poor or extremely poor water quality respectively also nearly two thirds of the groundwater is significantly deteriorated or has unqualified quality china s ecological environment bulletin 2017 some water related environmental problems such as the long term water resource shortages the rapid deterioration of water quality and the degeneration of aquatic ecosystems have significantly limited the healthy and sustainable socio economy growth isik et al 2019 aljerf et al 2018 inthasaro et al 2016 in general the intensity and scale of socio economic development should not exceed a certain threshold of we in a specific region jia et al 2018 wang et al 2019 identifying methods to effectively alleviate the conflict between the economic development ed and we to realize their coordinated development has emerged as a topic of great concern in regionally sustainable development in china fang et al 2019 however it is difficult to quantitatively estimate the interactions between socio economic development and we due to their complexity among the elements in these systems han et al 2017 originating from the field of physics coupling is defined as two or more systems interact with each other to achieve a degree of synergy wang et al 2013 cui et al 2019 he et al 2017 this concept has been successfully applied in the field of environmental science such as the socio economic development and environment response cui et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 ge et al 2016 coordination namely a sound interaction among different sectors of a system can be further used to measure the sustainable development of an investigated system fang et al 2016 joore et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 together the combination forms the coupling coordination degree ccd which is a comprehensive index measuring the harmony between development and evolution in a system the ccd model reveals the level of disorder or order from uncoordinated to the orderly coordination of the development trend in this respect some scholars have explored the relationship in human environment or social ecological system accounting for some problems related to rapid ed and environmental degradation in urban areas folke et al 2005 guan et al 2011 shao et al 2014 and coordination degree between socio economic and ecological environment system kunz et al 2013 fang et al 2016 subsequently some scholars have studied the relationship among ecology economy energy environment and resource management such as society ecology tanga et al 2013 leslie et al 2019 urbanization environment wang et al 2014 liu et al 2018 economy resource environment zhang et al 2016 economy energy environment zuo et al 2017 population economy environment zhang et al 2008 as well as social economy and water environmental quality liu et al 2020 all these works indicate that the ccd model is an effective way to evaluate the sustainable development in a regional economy environment nexus in china studies have also focused on water resources at different scales including water resource carrying capacity and water efficiency in terms of water resource carrying capacity bu et al 2020 constructed an index system of urban water ecological carrying capacity wang et al 2017 performed a dynamic analysis of the carrying capacity of water resources in the wetlands region of beijing yang et al 2019 constructed a multi index evaluation system to assess the water resource carrying capacity of xi an in china using an analytic hierarchy process model to study problems related to water efficiency the environmental kuznets curve ekc model was applied to examine the interaction between water efficiency and ed in china from 1999 to 2014 different from the ekc theory some related works have discussed the coupling mechanism of economic growth and we protection ke et al 2016 industry improvements and water resource efficiency zhang et al 2013 water resource and employment in agriculture and industry sectors davijani et al 2016 recently many scholars tried to reveal the coordination and spatial correlation between the socio economic development and water resource environmental quality for instance sun et al 2020 employed social network analysis sna to study spatial distribution characteristics of water resource efficiency in china and found significant regional differences in water sources liu et al 2020 constructed a comprehensive index system to study the coordination between socio economy and we subsystems in the nansi lake catchment in china tan et al 2019 examined the change trend in the ccd between water resource environment and socio economy development in jiangsu province of china cui et al 2020 introduced an integrated approach to predict the ccd between social economy and we on an urban scale for kunming city during 2016 2025 zhang et al 2021 used logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi method to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution and driving factors of wastewater treatment efficiency in the context of china s river chief system base on the tobit model zhang et al 2020 explored the factors influencing industrial water efficiency and found that water resource endowment technological innovation water structure and environmental regulations positively impact industrial water efficiency while industrial structure and urbanization are negatively related to the efficiency at present there are some deficiencies in the existing research summarized as follows first most of studies have only explored water efficiency at a sector level rather than investigate the overall level of the water resource environment second most of studies are only one sided or city based with less thinking a regional relationship between socio economy and we in china third previous researchers have performed a unilateral evaluation of water resource carrying capacity water use efficiency and driving factors but have not provided a unified framework in particular few quantitative works examine the driving mechanism and dynamic evolution characteristics of the ccd from the space time perspective thus it is necessary to comprehensively evaluate the coordination between ed and we subsystems and clarify the factors influencing the ccd from a spatiotemporal perspective in china s provinces the objectives of this study mainly include i constructing the ccd model to study the coordination between ed and we subsystems in china ii employing the spatial autocorrelation model to explore the clustering spatial association and spatial dynamics for the ccd in different regions iii introducing a geographically weighted regression gwr model to clarify the main factors influencing the ccd and its spatiotemporal distribution characteristics at a provincial level and iv proposing recommendations for improving water resource and environment and formulating sustainable water management policies in china it is expected that the results of this study can be helpful to water environmental protection and management of water resources in china and the decision making of chinese government under high quality development the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the methodology and data and introduce the mechanism of coupling between ed and we subsystems section 3 provides results and discussion of the regional distribution and spatial dynamics of the ccd as well as driving factors influencing the ccd based on gwr model the main conclusions policy implications and limitations of this paper are then presented in section 4 2 methodology and data 2 1 study area as the world s largest developing country china has the fastest growing major economy in the world with growth rate averaging 10 over the past 30 years however disparity among the development of its regions has widened in the past since the reform and opening up policy in 1978 china has 34 provincial level administration regions of which 30 except tibet hong kong macau and taiwan are studied in this work these 30 provincial level administration regions can be divided into four groups namely eastern central western and northeastern regions the eastern region comprises 10 administrative areas including three out of the four municipalities in china namely beijing shanghai and tianjin the other seven administrative areas include fujian guangdong hainan hebei jiangsu shandong and zhejiang provinces the northeastern region includes heilongjiang jilin and liaoning whereas the central region includes anhui henan hubei hunan jiangxi and shanxi provinces the western region includes four autonomous regions one municipality i e chongqing and six provinces the autonomous regions are guangxi inner mongolia ningxia and xinjiang and the provinces are gansu guizhou qinghai shaanxi sichuan and yunnan 2 2 constructing an indicator system the economic system refers mainly to a man made system constructed through human activity while the water environmental subsystem refers to a natural system golubiewski et al 2012 fang et al 2016 the evolution of each subsystem is conditioned by the structure and function of the other wang et al 2018 kennedy et al 2011 so the coupling degree between ed and we can be viewed as an effect feedback framework which is vital to realize high quality development an effective evaluation indicator system should comprehensively and verifiably reflect all aspects of ed and we subsystems in this respect ginevicius et al 2006 constructed a complex index of socio economic development using more than six factors liu et al 2018 established a socio economic index using four factors including industrial structure economic scale business climate and external communications as for we indicator liu et al 2020 constructed a comprehensive index system of we subsystem in the nansi lake catchment cui et al 2020 constructed the we index to examine the interaction of socio economy and we in kunming of china based on the principles of scientificity rationality operability and representativeness we selected 26 indices to evaluate ed and we subsystems in china s 30 provinces taiwan hong kong tibet and macao were not considered due to the limited data here the we index follows the pressure state response psr framework which is first proposed by canadian scholars d rapport and t friend oecd 1993 and then is used to study eco environmental issues pissourios et al 2013 wang et al 2013 this model emphasizes the relationship between environmental pressure and degradation which can influence the entire decision making process water environmental pressure in psr model refers to the load brought by human activities or natural factors on water environmental security which generally results in unstable coupling state of ed and we subsystems thus we select per capita water consumption water consumption per 10000 yuan of gdp proportion of industrial and agricultural water consumption sewage discharge and chemical oxygen demand per ton to quantify water environmental pressure the state of we indicates the status and change of water resource and environment under the pressure which are represented as four aspects average annual precipitation per capita water resources water qualification rate of water functional area and water resource utilization rate the effect of water environmental quality indicates the response of government social organizations and related groups to the protection of water environment in the face of the realistic state of the environment response index is composed of urban water penetration rate industrial water reuse rate farmland effective irrigation rate urban sewage treatment rate and investment proportion of wastewater treatment to gdp which are used to measure the human effort on water pollution abatement as for the ed index system we select three dimensions namely economic scale economic structure and economic vitality the economic scale includes four indicators gdp per capita comprehensively reflects regional economic scale and wealth per capita disposable income and net income of rural residents reflects the regional consumption capacity from the perspective of expenditures per capita investment in fixed assets reflects the ability to improve material and cultural life as regards as economic structure proportion of primary and tertiary industry is an important index and is directly related to the growth potential and competitiveness of the region economy proportion of government financial expenditure to gdp reflects the power source of economic growth and measures the sustainability of regional economic growth rural engel coefficient reflects the living standard of the grass roots people in the region from the proportion of farmers food expenditures the economic vitality includes three indicators gdp growth rate is selected to reflect the economic growth rate while the social labor productivity and per capita retail sales of consumer goods reflects the vitality of economic growth the coupling coordination evaluation index system of the integrated system of water environment and economic development in china is shown in table 1 2 3 data source and a pre processing the data used in this study were mainly derived from china statistical yearbook http www stats gov cn tjsj ndsj china statistical yearbook on environment http tongji cnki net kns55 navi homepage aspx id 2011010074 name

values were extrapolated based on the average annual growth rate to eliminate difference in dimension magnitude and sign between indicators the raw data were standardized using the extreme value processing method li et al 2012 expressed as 1 x i j x i j m i n x 1 j x n j m a x x 1 j x n j m i n x 1 j x n j 2 x i j m a x x 1 j x n j x i j m a x x 1 j x n j m i n x 1 j x n j in eqs 1 and 2 x i j represents the value of the jth indicator in the region i i 1 n j 1 m m i n x 1 j x n j and m a x x 1 j x n j are the minimum and maximum values of indicator x i j respectively the variable x i j refers to the positive dimension value while x i j is the negative dimension indicator all the values for indicator x j are normalized into the categories of 0 1 2 4 the coupling coordination degree model to reveal the coordination between ed and we subsystems we applied the entropy value method to measure the sample index weight p i j as follows 3 p i j x i j i 1 n x i j here n is the total number of samples by using eq 3 we can obtain the entropy of the jth indicator 4 e j k i 1 m p i j l n p i j where the constant variable k is related to the sample number n and is estimated using k 1 ln n with 0 e 1 the informational entropy weight w j is thus expressed as follows 5 w j 1 e j i 1 m 1 e j then we calculate the comprehensive score of each program expressed as 6 z i j i 1 j 1 m n x i j o r x i j w j subsequently the degree of coupling between ed and we subsystems is obtained using formula 7 7 c u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 2 1 2 in this expression c represents the degree of coupling and u 1 and u 2 represent the comprehensive evaluation index of ed and we subsystems respectively in general the coupling degree model demonstrates the strength of the interaction but does not reflect the level of coordinated development of a system based on the relevant research the ccd model between the two subsystems was determined by eqs 8 and 9 expressed as 8 d c t 1 2 9 t α u 1 β u 2 here d represents the coupling coordination degree t represents the comprehensive evaluation index of ed and we subsystems the α and β represent ed and we in the whole weight system respectively determined by α β 0 5 to more accurately determine the degree of coordination between ed and we subsystems the ccd is classified using the uniform distribution function method as listed in table 2 2 5 spatial autocorrelation model the spatial autocorrelation method is mainly used to explore the spatial distribution of researched objects and refers to whether the attributed values of adjacent regions within a research area are related or independent moran 1950 in this model the spatial distribution pattern could be evaluated by moran s i index p value and z scores and these three indicators determine whether the pattern is clustered dispersed or random the p value is the probability that the observed variables present to a random pattern while the z score is the standard deviation and both the z scores and p values are associated with the standard normal distribution the global moran s i reflects the overall correlation between regions which can be expressed as follows 10 m o r a n s i i 1 m i 1 m i i d i d d i d s 2 i 1 m i 1 m i i where m is the total number of regions and i i is the spatial weight e g for provinces i and i if both i and i are adjacent then i i 1 if they are not adjacent then i i 0 the variables d i and d i are the coordination values of i and i respectively expressed as follows 11 d 1 m i 1 m d i s 2 1 m i 1 m d i d 2 in general moran s i value belongs to the set 1 1 indicating that the attribute values of different regions are spatially dependent which is a positive correlation the local indicator of spatial association lisa was used to analyze the lst spatial aggregation as follows 12 l o c a l m o r a n s i d i d s 2 i i i i d 11 here the local spatial correlations are described using the moran s i scatter plot four cluster types are defined based on lisa results that is for ed and we subsystems the types refers to high high h h low low l l high low h l and low high l h liu et al 2019 2 6 gwr model the ordinary least squares ols model was generally applied in different regions with relevant influencing factors however this kind of relationship is assumed to not vary across different spatial positions and does not provide practical and meaningful reference results according to the first law of geography state there are more similarities between adjacent geographical entities tobler et al 1970 as such the gwr model which allows parameters to be locally estimated is better than ols model this model is expressed as follows fotheringham et al 1996 duo et al 2016 cao et al 2018 13 y i β 0 μ i v i k β k μ i v i x i k ε i where y i is the dependent variable x i k is the explanatory variables of an n n matrix μ i v i is a function of location β 0 is the constant term of regression β k is the parameter vector to be estimated and ε i is the random error term gwr model uses a distance decay function to determine the scope of spatial dependence the akaike information criterion aic and kernel density estimation are used to determine the appropriate bandwidth and parameters as such the gaussian function is expressed as follows 14 w i j e x p d i j b 2 where d i j is the distance between i and j and b is the kernel bandwidth additionally the international community uses the cross validation cv method proposed by bowman et al 1984 to measure regression coefficients when bandwidth is determined the function between b and cv is expressed as follows 15 c v i 1 n y i y i b 2 where y i is the estimated value of y i when cv reaches its minimum level considering that a different weight method can result in a different bandwidth aic is selected in this study as the calculation criterion 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of the ed and we index system using the index system constructed above we evaluate the weights of each indicator in china s 30 provinces from 2010 to 2019 as listed in table 1 the analysis of ed index mainly includes three primary indicators ranked in descending order of weight as follows economic scale 47 96 economic vitality 32 63 and economic structure 20 42 obviously the economic scale plays a main role in influencing ed whereas the effect of economic structure is relatively small for the secondary index of ed three factors are the most important in determining the high quality development per capita retail sales of consumer goods 15 12 social labor productivity 14 26 and gdp per capita 13 39 here per capita disposable income of urban residents 12 41 and per capita net income of rural residents 12 12 are important factors to ed these findings of this study are consistent with that of socio economic index of chinese provincial capital cities fan et al 2019 thus the policymakers should focus more on the economic and industrial structures when implementing a new high quality development plan in china in terms of we quality there is a major difference between the primary indicators as listed in table 1 the three primary indicators are ranked in descending order of weight as follows state 60 34 response 27 43 and pressure 12 42 the state index plays the most important role in improving we quality with respect to criteria layer three factors of indicator layer are main factors to influencing the we per capita water resources 34 39 average annual precipitation 18 32 and farmland effective irrigation rate 15 67 it is noteworthy that the agricultural indicator has the greatest effect of all indexes from indicator layer emphasizing the importance of protecting agricultural water environment as china is undergoing a period of high quality development the demand for water resources has increased dramatically this finding also suggests that chinese government should pay significant attention to protecting water resources and abating water environmental pollution 3 2 the temporal characteristics of coupling coordination degree in china s provinces the index systems for both ed and we at a province scale are standardized in the range of 0 1 then the degree of coordination between ed and we subsystems is measured by using eqs 8 and 9 figure 1 shows the ccd of the four regions in china from 2010 to 2019 which reflects the coordination level of each region with the exception of fluctuations in individual years the coordination degree between the two subsystems was consistently optimized and steadily increased but the gap between the ccd of each region doesn t change significantly the change trend of the ccd from high to low is in the order of east west central and northeast i e the east has the highest ccd followed by west central and northeast obviously the regional distribution of the coupling coordination state is similar with the relationship of urbanization and eco environment in china except for some differences in the central and western regions liu et al 2018 another prominent finding was that during the research periods of 2010 2012 the ccd of the four regions is in the range from 0 4 to 0 6 reflecting a transitional development state the eastern region has a higher ccd reaching 0 75 in 2019 and mainly remains in a moderate coordination state for the central and western regions the ccd remains in a transitional development state with an obvious transition from near imbalance to basic coordination in 2013 these findings are similar with change trend of the ccd between socio economy and ecological environment in provincial capital cities fan et al 2019 we also note that the ccd of northeast china is the lowest and remains in an imbalanced state all these results can be explained as follows high quality ed level are mainly concentrated in eastern china which has rich natural resources dense populations advanced technology and convenient transportation these factors provide the adequate labor and material bases to support more mature environment protection thus this facilitates the coordinated development between ed and we subsystems in comparison the central and western regions generally lack advanced industrial technology human resources and financial support the economy of western china is rather underdeveloped and mainly relies on enterprises that generate high levels of pollution and consume high amounts of water to support its socio economic development in these regions the pursuit of economic benefits is one sided and does not consider we protection making the coordination between ed and we relatively low in short the ccd in china s provinces is not high indicating necessary for the improvements of coordination development between ed and we subsystems 3 3 the spatial characteristics of coupling coordination degree in this work we diveded the degree of coordination into six levels and were visualized with gis to reveal the spatial distribution in china s provinces as can be seen from table 2 and fig 2 most of china s provinces are in the transition development state including 17 provinces that are close to being imbalanced i e xinjiang jilin liaoning inner mongolia hebei shanxi shannxi henan shandong anhui hubei chongqing sichuan guizhou yunnan and guangxi and 8 provinces that achieve the basic coordination i e qinghai jiangsu tianjing shanghai hunan jiangxi guangdong hainan in contrast a small number of provinces are located in a moderate level of coordination including beijing fujian and zhejiang after 10 years development the ccd of most provinces in china is consistently increasing in particular three provinces i e beijing shanghai and zhejiang exceed 0 8 in 2019 thereby reaching a high level coordination these provinces are mainly concentrated in the developed eastern regions interestingly the spatial distribution of the coordination degree in 2019 is consistent with that of low carbon development and urbanization in china provinces song et 2018 in addition although most of the provinces have a near imbalance of the ccd in 2010 the number decreases significantly with time and all of them changes to a balanced development during 2016 2019 the spatial distribution of provinces with a basic coordinated state is mainly concentrated in northern china including xinjiang inner mongolia ningxia gansu heilongjiang jilin liaoning hebei shanxi henan and guizhou which may be related to lower wastewater treatment efficiency in these provinces zhang et al 2021 we also find a clear increase in the number of provinces with moderate coordination levels in 2019 and mostly concentrated in southern china however these areas change to a nearly imbalanced state during 2013 2016 by the end of the study period most provinces in western and northeastern china are in a transitional development state indicating that the development of the coordination between ed and we subsystems is relatively low in developing areas 3 4 the subtype of the coupling coordination degree in china s provinces to identify the effect of ed and we on the coordination at a provincial scale we further explore the main class of the ccd to show the interaction mechanism between ed and we here the ccd is divided into three types ed led we lags behind ed synchronous development and we led ed lags behind we as shown in table 1 we find that the spatial distribution of the three different ccd types is sensitive to the investigated regions most of the ed led subtypes are concentrated in eastern china while the we led types are in the central and western china during 2010 2013 as a matter of fact some previous studies have obtained similar results including xi an zhao et al 2012 zhuhai yang et al 2013 and wuhan ding et al 2015 these findings indicate that in the early stage of economic growth many regions or cities sacrifice the environment quality to promote urbanization and the eco environment constraints on urbanization always has a lag effect after 10 years of development the number of provinces with we led subtype decreases to 9 provinces including xinjiang qinghai guansu sichuan guizhou guangxi yunnan fujian and hainan however the wd led subtype becomes the main class of the ccd in most regions that is the number of ed led type has been increasing with a minimum ratio higher than 62 83 additionally the we led regions are mainly located in a transitional development state while the ed led type corresponds to a high coordination state in comparison the provinces with synchronization development mainly concentrated in the eastern coastal provinces of zhejiang guangdong and liaoning there are few regions achieving synchronization development by the end of the study period which indicates these regions are not coordinated with respect to ed and we protection 3 5 spatial dependency characteristics of the ccd before establishing the gwr model we use moran s i to explore whether there is a spatial autocorrelation of the ccd in china s 30 provinces table 3 presents the calculated moran s i value of the degree of interregional coordination from 2010 to 2019 where moran s i value belongs to 1 1 the moran s i values of the global spatial correlation coefficient are significant from 2010 to 2019 indicating the ccd has a positive spatial agglomeration that is provinces with a high ccd tended to be adjacent to other provinces with high ccd values while provinces with a low ccd level tended to be associated with those with low ccd values all the p values are less than 0 01 which denies the result of random spatial distribution pattern the z scores are also higher than 2 32 which provide the significant evidence of spatial autocorrelation additionally the global moran s i index of the ccd gradually changes from 0 292 to 0 377 showing a steady spatial agglomeration effect to further analyze the coordination characteristics at the different surrounding regions we calculate the local moran s i scatter plots of the ccd we find a certain spatial limitation to the geographical spillover effect of the ccd i e the spillover effect decreases significantly when increasing the spatial distance the moran s i scatter plots of spatial clustering mode during 2010 2019 and the agglomeration type of each province are summarized according to the graphs as shown in fig 3 and table 4 the main results are as follows i in 2010 10 provinces are concentrated in the first quadrant marked h h i e beijing fujian guangdong hainan hunan jiangsu jiangxi tianjin and zhejiang the ccd of eastern china is high and the gaps between adjacent regions are relatively small indicating a strong spatial correlation ii five provinces i e anhui guangxi gansu hubei and shandong are included in the second quadrant of l h showing the heterogeneous characteristics with the adjacent regions iii there are 13 provinces in the third quadrant marked l l mainly concentrating in the central and western regions i e guizhou hebei henan heilongjiang jilin liaoning inner mongolia ningxia shanxi shaanxi sichuan yunnan and chongqing iv the least number of provinces are located in the fourth quadrant and includes western xinjiang and qinghai the ccd is higher than that of the adjacent coordination provinces after 10 years development the number of provinces with the h h agglomeration increases by 2 with the addition of jiangsu and guangxi the number of provinces with the l h agglomeration reaches 5 with hainan included and hubei remaining unchanged as for the l l agglomeration mode there is an obvious increase in the number of provinces and reaching up to 14 with the addition of xinjiang however qinghai is stabilized at the h l mode in 2019 in short the regions in the h h and l l agglomeration modes occupy most of the provinces in china which is independent of the time variations from the perspective of spatial distribution the cluster mode of the ccd continually shifts towards the h h cluster mode especially in central china under this circumstance the regional differences narrow in central china forming a spatial agglomeration pattern supporting the coordinated development between ed and we 3 6 influencing factors of the ccd based on gwr model the gwr model was constructed by setting the ccd as the dependent variable and population density x 1 energy consumption x 2 fixed investment x 3 and r d expenditures x 4 as the independent variables here the r2 and adjusted r2 reflect the degree of model fit and the residual sum of squares rss reflects the model accuracy the aicc information represents an important criterion to evaluate the goodness of model fit the smaller the value is the higher the accuracy of gwr model will be tables 5 and 6 present the corresponding parameters used in this study in which three fixed bandwidths of 202 88 and 207 426 are selected for regression however the sigma parameter exhibits significant differences and at a bandwidth of 207 426 the value of sigma parameter increases up to 0 062 with the effect of parameter r2 and adjusted r2 being superior we also find that the value of local coefficients varies from region to region the gwr model simulates the spatial difference in each factor on the spatial distribution of ccd and the regression coefficients of each factor are visualized to analyze the influence on the ccd the population density produces a negative influence on the ccd in china s provinces in 2000 the spatial distribution of local coefficient follows a spatial gradient pattern decreasing gradually from the southeastern to northwestern direction in china the greatest coefficients of population density are concentrated in xinjiang qinghai and gansu with the lowest coefficients in heilongjiang jilin liaoning zhejiang fujian guangdong and hainan fig 4 a after 10 years development there is a significant decrease of the negative impact on ccd but the coefficients in eastern china are smaller compared to those in the central and western regions northeast china i e heilongjiang jilin and liaoning has the largest coefficient followed by jiangsu shanghai and zhejiang which are mainly distributed in eastern china fig 5 a the coefficients of most of the eastern provinces in 2019 are negative indicating that population density hinders the coordinated development between ed and we these results of this study are similar with the negative effects of population density on ecological footprint predicted by gwr in china wu et al 2020 but is different from the impacts of population on air environment in shandong province wang et al 2013 the reason can be attributed to that the areas with the developed economy and high level urbanization i e beijing tianjing shanghai zhejiang and jiangsu are favorable to increasing the number of population the increase of population density leads to a significant pressure on we and is thus negatively related to the ccd however the out flow of human resources in labor exporting provinces such as guizhou and guangxi is prominent which leads to the decrease of urban population density within a specific period of time therefore the impact of population density on the ccd shows a significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity as for the energy consumption factor the gwr analysis shows that it is negatively correlated with the ccd however there are significant differences of the coefficients in the different provinces as shown in figs 4 b and 5 b in 2010 the spatial distribution of the regression coefficient exhibits the spatial aggregation at some extent but no spatial gradient appears the negative effect of energy consumption in five provinces i e qinghai jiangsu shanghai zhejiang and guangdong ranks the highest which are mainly concentrated in eastern china except for qinghai in western china by comparison the coefficient of energy consumption experiences a steady decrease in 2019 and is inconsistent with the china s economic gradient instead it has a greater negative effect on the ccd in southern china these findings are similar with the change trend of the coordination degree between socio economy and ecological environment in provincial capital cities fan et al 2019 additionally the optimization and updating of the industrial structure in developed areas is continuously increasing with the increasing output value of the china s tertiary industry and improvements in urbanization quality the demand for water resources steadily increases therefore decreasing energy consumption may be an effective way to improve the ccd in eastern china however many regions including parts of western and central china i e xinjiang qinghai gansu guangxi shanxi henan anhui and shannxi experience a negative to positive transition for energy consumption factor from 2010 to 2019 this differs from the interaction mechanism between energy consumption and ecology in china s provinces wu et al 2020 the main reason can be attributed to the threshold effect the impact of energy consumption on the ccd is related with water efficiency water consumption structure and technological progress before reaching a threshold where the effect of energy consumption is not significant the industrial structure optimization can improve the we quality as illustrated in 2019 once the threshold is exceeded the energy consumption significantly reduces the ccd consequently the negative impact of energy consumption in these provinces turns into a positive one and increases from 2016 to 2019 under this circumstance the rapid socio economic development in western china improves the coordination degree between ed and we compared to the two factors above the fixed investment is positively correlated with the ccd and the number of positive provinces far exceeds the negative ones figs 4 c and 5 c this indicates that the factor of fixed investment is favorable for improving the ccd we note that this effect is consistent with changes of water resource and environmental carrying capacity of 286 cities in china chen et al 2021 from a spatial distribution perspective in 2010 the greatest coefficients of fixed investment are concentrated in the western qinghai while the lowest coefficients are in the eastern regions including provinces of jiangsu shanghai and liaoning fig 4 c after 10 years development the coefficients of fixed investment decreases along the southeastern direction with a high value locating in the northeastern heilongjiang liaoning jilin as well as the southern guangdong and hainan low values are mainly concentrated in the eastern shandong jiangsu shanghai and zhejiang which is different from the change trend of china s economic gradient as shown in fig 5 c although the fixed investment supports harmonious development in most regions of china the fast track socio economic development is unfavorable for improving of the ccd in the developed southeastern china this is because the implementation of the western development policy and relevant environmental policies leads to increases in fixed investment evenly promotes the coordinated development between ed and we by comparison the industry layout of southeastern china has reached a high level state and the time non stationary is relatively small there is not as much space to greatly improve we level as before thus the we remains stable or even declining slightly however the we will eventually be improved as the progress of urbanization is advanced and water environment related improvement measures are implemented which is consistent with the findings of wang et al 2012 r d expenditure is an important factor influencing the ccd and shows a different transformation between the positive and negative effect in different regions as illustrated in figs 4 d and 5 d generally the increases of r d expenditure can stimulate technological advances in water resource conservation and environmental protection which would improve water efficiency and water structure and further mitigate we crises in china s provinces however this study shows that the r d expenditure is negatively correlated with the ccd during 2010 2016 indicating that the technical changes have a restraining effect on the ccd this differed from our expectation of the relationship between r d expenditure and ccd by comparison this finding is consistent with that of r d expenditure on ecological foot print reported by wu et al 2020 except the western regions show the different characteristics from the perspective of spatial distribution the negative effect is mainly concentrated in five provinces in 2010 including the western qinghai gansu and xinjiang and the eastern guangdong and hainan provinces fig 4 d after 10 years development the spatial distribution of the regression coefficient decreases from the eastern to western regions via a gradient pattern that is the high value and low value areas follows a sequence of east is high and west is low fig 5 d in particular three regions i e xinjiang qinghai and gansu have the largest negative coefficient indicating that the regulation of r d expenditure brings about the water ecological deterioration in western china compared to eastern china due to the tempo spatial differences of the effect of technology on the ccd different regional characteristics and specific circumstances should be considered when introducing new technology furthermore the r d expenditure may have a rebound effect which means that the new technologies and products may increase consumer demand strengthen the effect of technical factors on we and lead to a deterioration of we quality especially in the developed western regions 4 conclusions policy implications and limitations 4 1 conclusions this study established the index evaluation system to estimate the ccd between ed and we the coupling coordination and spatial global local autocorrelation model were applied to examine the characteristics of coordination degree in china s 30 provinces also a gwr model was applied to analyze the impact of population density energy consumption fixed investment and r d expenditure on the ccd from 2010 to 2019 key conclusions are as follows 1 the coordination between the ed and we subsystems shows a spatial distribution pattern of high in south low in north which indicates there has a greater ccd in the south and a lower ccd in the north transitional development areas have gradually spread to the central regions and there has been an increase trend in the number of moderate and high coordination provinces 2 the ed led type is mainly concentrated in central and eastern china while the we led type is concentrated in the northeastern and western regions the areas with synchronous development are relatively small in number and are mainly concentrated in east coastal china 3 there is a spatial dependence of the coordination between ed and we subsystems from the perspective of global correlation and this dependence is weakened with increasing geographical distance the local mode of agglomeration shows a trend towards the evolution of h h clustering in the eastern region 4 the gwr analysis indicates that the factors of population density energy consumption fixed investment and r d expenditure significantly influence the degree of coordination between the ed and we subsystems fixed investment and r d expenditure have a significant promotion effect on improving the ccd while the impacts of population density and energy consumption vary between regions as time evolves changes in the driving force in a region can extend spatial effects to adjacent regions through the spatial transmission mechanism 4 2 policy implications as a main driving factor population density is positively related with the ccd in central and western china and negatively related with ccd in the eastern regions this indicates that the rapid ed did not necessarily support improvement of the ccd governments should continue to deepen reforms of the dual household registration system in urban and rural areas making population density further optimized in the whole country the largest cities such as beijing and shanghai should restrain the inflow of population and avoid reaching a population carrying pressure it cannot support the western areas such as qinghai guizhou inner mongolia gansu and yunnan which experience population losses and low water environmental pressure should implement a population attraction policy to encourage populations to return this would help to achieve a more reasonable distribution and balance of population and water resource and environment in china energy consumption has a significantly negative effect on the ccd in china the government should take active measures to adjust the current industry and consumption structure limit the expansion of high consumption water industries promoting sustainable development efforts should also be made to protect water environment by developing and introducing new technologies to improve water efficiency additionally government should strengthen the cooperation and coordination among the eastern and western regions minimizing the negative impact of the water rebound effect when developing policies fixed investment plays a prominent role in improving the ccd in northeastern northwestern and central china the government should change the concept of ed emphasizing the quality of fixed investment and paying attention to the optimization and adjustment of industrial structure for the eastern regions the current ed model has limited improvements of the ccd so the local government should rationalize the production capacity to advance enterprises with low consumption water non polluting advanced technology and managerial experience in western regions governments should strengthen their oversight of water resource consumption raising the threshold for high polluting enterprises and encouraging provincial environmental cooperation to control the deterioration of water pollution and coordinate pollution abatement r d expenditure plays a more important role in improving the ccd while its suppressing effect on the ed growth is relatively strong in the central and western regions it enhances the improvement of the ccd in eastern and northeastern regions and become a favorable factor for enhancing synchronous development between ed and we to realize the maximum effect of limited technology resources a public investment and incentive policy should be implemented in eastern and northeastern china in the western and central regions local governments should develop their own technology to protect we according to their actual industries this would prevent the western regions from achieving ed at a high cost of water environmental degradation and avoid repeating the development process once followed by the economically developed eastern regions in summary the coefficients of four driving factors show the spatial aggregation to some extent with the gradient based increase or decrease trend which are influenced not only by their own characteristics but also by the surrounding conditions hence the province level synchronization of ed and we requires regional cooperation in different ways meanwhile policymakers should develop the role of market in improving the ccd achieving the overall coordination between ed and we under high quality development 4 3 limitations due to the limitations of data acquisition this study did not consider factors such as climate temperature and environmental flow thus lacks the in depth exploration of process mechanism meanwhile considering that high quality development has become the focus of china s economic growth we should expand the research scale to cover county level administrative regions in order to have more practical guiding

24529,the longstanding peg phytoplankton ecology group qualitative conceptual model describes generalized seasonal phytoplankton dynamics in temperate lakes and suggests important mechanisms driving these processes in the research presented here we re created the conceptual peg dynamics using a novel mechanistic numerical plankton model the numerical model incorporates only a handful of interacting factors and biological rules key model features include seasonally variable temperature mixing depth and light dynamic zooplankton and phytoplankton populations and multiple dynamic nutrient concentrations the model design is unique in that it incorporates a population rich phytoplankton assemblage where life history traits of members are based on ecological principles trade offs between traits allowing the assemblage to organize over time based on nutrient competition and grazing using 50th year solutions to the model solved with fourth order runge kutta methods i e a period when the dynamics had reached stable non equilibrium states sensitivity analyses were run by individually varying model parameters 50 and comparing the effect on model responses of interest simulation analyses revealed the important role light and temperature limitation played both early and late in the year controlling plankton biomass trade offs in phytoplankton life history characteristics determined the composition of the spring bloom under non nutrient limiting conditions fast growing edible populations dominated and the post clear water phase assemblage under low nutrient conditions slower growing less edible populations dominated grazer characteristics specifically rate of grazing and spring emergence determined the occurrence of the clear water phase and influenced the post assemblage composition where a clear water phase was absent when the grazing rate was low or spring emergence absent and the highly inedible populations were lost from the assemblage hydraulic flushing also played an important role where diminished inflow led to higher richness evenness and diversity due to greater overwintering of less edible taxa which influenced phytoplankton composition during spring bloom diminishing secondary productivity these results increase understanding of the relative roles of fundamental mechanisms structuring natural aquatic ecosystems and reinforce the significance of key biotic and abiotic system components of temperate lakes keywords peg model multi species model phytoplankton succession predator prey dynamics clear water phase ecological trade offs 1 introduction in 1986 the plankton ecology group peg published a qualitative conceptual model that has since become central to the study of aquatic ecology sommer et al 1986 the peg model describes general trends in the seasonal plankton dynamics of an intensively studied dimictic temperate lake and the key mechanisms driving those dynamics the conceptual model is outlined using a series of sequential steps which are then compared amongst several other well studied systems since its initial publication the model has served as a sort of architype against which aquatic system behavior can be compared in order to gain insight on mechanisms shaping specific systems and so the model has been put to the test many times in many different ways over the years sommer 1996 roelke et al 1997 scheffer et al 1997 jeppesen et al 2004 roelke et al 2004 sommer et al 2012 domis et al 2013 lv et al 2014 the peg conceptual model incorporated several ideas that are now considered textbook for example the authors suggested that both allogenic succession driven by non equilibrium seasonal factors and autogenic succession driven by biotic factors played important roles in determining plankton dynamics at different times over the course of a given year and that both bottom up resource availability as well as top down zooplankton grazing mechanisms shaped phytoplankton assemblage structure at various times more specifically for dimictic systems in which complete water column overturn holomixis occurs once in the spring and once in the fall it was suggested that spring mixing followed by the formation of a seasonal thermocline was important these events were thought to generate nutrient and light conditions that allowed for the initiation of a spring bloom a period of exponential growth of fast growing and highly edible phytoplankton this was followed by a clear water phase a well known phenomenon occurring in many temperate lakes thought to be caused by zooplankton over exploitation of a highly edible phytoplankton food source while top down grazing effects were considered responsible for clearing the water of phytoplankton biomass the bloom that initiated the zooplankton boom was fueled by the bottom up effect of high resource availability during the summer months a shallow mixed layer was thought to create conditions where autogenic phytoplankton succession driven by nutrient competition determined plankton dynamics finally fall mixing disrupted the stratified water column ending the primacy of autogenic succession and ensuing low light conditions throughout the winter months led to low plankton biomass resetting the yearly plankton successional trajectory since its initial publication several factors not mentioned or considered of lesser importance in the original peg model have received attention as important ecosystem shaping processes sommer et al 2012 these include but are not limited to the role of temperature adrian et al 2006 blenckner et al 2007 domis et al 2013 berger et al 2014 zohary et al 2020 overwintering of plankton cáceres 1998 gerten adrian 2002 sommer lewandowska 2011 hrycik

and higher trophic levels shapiro wright 1984 carpenter et al 1985 jeppesen et al 1997 hansson et al 1998 carpenter et al 2001 gliwicz 2003 in this research the objective was to build a simple numerical model that reproduced peg dynamics driven by mechanisms described in the conceptual model and then use the resulting model to better understand the relative importance of those mechanisms in shaping seasonal dynamics we focused on mechanisms that were described as relatively common amongst temperate lake systems and which involved only nutrients phytoplankton and zooplankton i e no fish while there are a myriad of existing numerical models that portray aspects of aquatic dynamics ranging from simple but insightful theoretical models e g npz see evans parslow 1985 franks et al 1986 to highly complex mechanistic systems models e g ce qual w2 general lake model see cole wells 2006 hipsey et al 2019 most of these models are either too simplistic e g include only one or two phytoplankton groups and few to no external forcing factors or are too complex for our purposes e g include detailed hydrodynamics and sediment processes further the model building process was considered an important aspect of this work in which forcing factors and mechanisms necessary to reproduce architype peg dynamics were identified therefore this work was initiated using a simple and widely used system comparable to an npz model where state variables include a nutrient concentration a phytoplankton population and a zooplankton population the simple base model was altered by adding many phytoplankton populations with life history traits that spanned a realistic gradient and which were based on ecological principles that created trade offs between traits we also incorporated both nitrogen and phosphorous as state variables seasonally variable temperature and mixing depth and both dynamic and seasonally variable light as model forcing factors the rational for these additions is discussed in the methods section the model design is unique in that population interactions e g competition for nutrients losses from grazing and forcing factors e g nutrient concentrations temperature light availability determine the composition of the emergent phytoplankton assemblage from a rich initial assemblage we considered this to result in a self organized assemblage differently npz and even highly complex model types have traditionally incorporated only a few phytoplankton populations using the model presented here parameterizations of the driving processes determined the traits that appeared in the emergent assemblage and those populations seasonal dynamics this allowed us to look at the model structure from which peg plankton dynamics emerged and better understand processes that produced that specific outcome further follow up sensitivity analyses demonstrated how the emergent assemblage traits and seasonal dynamics shifted under different conditions i e changes to the parameter values of driving processes others have also used a self organized modeling approach to investigate the relationship between emergent assemblage characteristics and complementarity in resource uptake traits roelke spatharis 2015 periodicity of fluctuating nutrient ratios sakavara et al 2018 and seasonal light variation bruggeman kooijman 2007 to create the model we focused on specific plankton dynamics described in the conceptual model and the mechanisms suggested as drivers these are further described in the methods section once the numerical model produced the prioritized dynamics using plausible mechanisms we conducted a qualitative comparison of the conceptual and numerical models as well as a sensitivity analysis of the numerical model both the model building process and the follow up analyses led to increased understanding of mechanisms driving the theoretical plankton dynamics and shed light on the relative importance that these factor may play in the seasonal changes observed in natural aquatic ecosystems we hope that the model can serve much as the original conceptual peg model has to test system behaviors that fall outside the dynamics created here and in doing so allow us to better understand conditions and mechanisms which give rise to them such work has become increasingly important as aquatic systems are faced with growing anthropogenic pressures and in many cases it is unclear how these complex systems will respond 2 methods 2 1 model description parameterization and differential equations to develop the numerical model the peg conceptual model was used as a guide as stated previously we focused on dynamics that involved nutrients phytoplankton and zooplankton and to keep the model as general as possible we considered seasonal dynamics that were widely common to the 21 lakes compared in sommer et al 1986 plankton dynamics described in the conceptual model that were considered important to reproduce using the numerical model included 1 a spring bloom of edible phytoplankton followed by a boom in zooplankton 2 a post bloom clear water phase 3 midyear phytoplankton succession resulting in less edible populations later in the year and 4 low overwinter plankton biomass in order to achieve the listed dynamics using the numerical model we prioritized the incorporation of mechanisms associated with specific seasonal events as described in the initial peg conceptual model sommer et al 1986 however it was recognized that different or additional mechanisms may need be incorporated if the objective dynamics could not be achieved the prioritized mechanisms included 1 average mixed layer light availability that was influenced by seasonally variable surface irradiance and mixing depth 2 temperature and light dependencies of phytoplankton growth rates 3 a trade off in phytoplankton life history characteristics where a high maximum growth rate under nutrient replete conditions also meant the given population would be more edible to zooplankton and less competitive under low nutrient conditions 4 the ability of the grazer population to clear relatively large volumes of water and exploit a highly edible food source the physical component of the numerical model is highly simplified employing a constant water volume with constant inflow bringing nutrients to the system because volume is constant outflow equals inflow the outflow removes nutrients and cells all model constants and variable ranges were parameterized using empirical data found in the literature and are reported in table 1 model formulations are further described below the phytoplankton assemblage included 100 populations with life history characteristics that spanned a gradient of values observed in natural systems this initial population richness was considered reasonable based on the work of roelke spatharis 2015 the model was initiated with these many populations so that organismal interactions and abiotic conditions determined the abundance and characteristics of the emergent assemblage more specifically phytoplankton dynamics were driven by competition for nutrients nutrient concentrations temperature and light influenced growth rates as well as grazing and dilution losses differential equations governing each phytoplankton population s density took the form 1 d a i d t a i u i h d z d t g i where a i was the phytoplankton density of population i 106cells l 1 u i was the specific growth rate of phytoplankton population i d 1 see eq 4 below h was the hydraulic flushing coefficient determined by dividing inflow by volume d 1 and g i was the rate at which phytoplankton population i was grazed 106cells indv 1 d 1 see eq 17 the phytoplankton populations were parameterized to reflect an ecologically based proportional relationship or trade off between each population s maximum growth rate u m a x i and it s edibility to the zooplankton population ei that is populations with lower u m a x i also had lower ei grover 1995 agrawal 1998 yoshida et al 2004 an additional ecologically based proportional relationship was imposed for each population between it s u m a x i and it s half saturation coefficient ksi j that is populations with higher u m a x i also had higher ksi j meaning they were less efficient at utilizing resources at low concentrations kilham kilham 1980 smayda 1980 as stated previously by creating a phytoplankton assemblage that spanned a gradient of characteristics and allowing them to self organize we gained insight into how specific characteristics and ecological relationships influenced a given population s competitive ability under various conditions initially the 100 phytoplankton populations were arranged along a linear gradient of evenly spaced growth rates ranging from 0 3 to 3 0 d 1 however we learned through simulation trials that peg dynamics were facilitated specifically the emergence of less edible populations later in the growing season when populations with intermediate traits were not a part of the initial phytoplankton assemblage therefore the results presented here were derived using 100 phytoplankton populations that were evenly spaced between 0 3 0 965 and 2 335 3 0 d 1 50 populations in each growth rate range for our purposes here if a population fell into the first range it was considered a slower grower and if it fell into the second range it was considered a faster grower temperature and light both proportionally influenced u m a x i and hydraulic displacement removed phytoplankton cells the zooplankton population was parameterized based on data for the genus daphnia a common and important component of the plankton assemblage in many freshwater systems which filter feeds and is capable of clearing large volumes of water when abundant this population s dynamics were driven by the edibility and abundance of each phytoplankton population we note here that future explorations of this model would benefit by employing many zooplankton taxa with life history traits spanning ecologically relevant gradients and allowing the zooplankton community to self organize similar to what we have done with phytoplankton here that however is beyond the scope of the current study parameter designations used for our daphnia zooplankton population are shown in table 1 the differential equation for the zooplankton populations took the form 2 d z d t d z d t u z m h ψ 2 z r e s t where z was the zooplankton population density indv l 1 µz was the specific growth rate for the zooplankton population d 1 see eq 15 m was the grazer population specific mortality rate d 1 ψ 2 was the coefficient enabling seasonal zooplankton hatching unit less see eq 19 and z r e s t was the zooplankton population density added through hatching indv l 1 d 1 abiotic factors of interest included averaged mix layer irradiance latitude temperature and nutrient concentrations for these parameterizations we relied on empirical observations from the well studied eutrophic temperate lake mendota located in wisconsin usa we recognize that these abiotic factors vary as a function lake morphometry position in the landscape including main axis orientation with predominate winds and elevation and characteristics of drainage basins supplying inflows to lakes we note here that future explorations of this model would benefit by employing variations in these but again that is beyond the scope of the current study nutrient concentrations were modeled as state variables with differential equations taking the

differential equations for the state variables 100 phytoplankton populations one zooplankton population and two nutrient concentrations were generated and solved numerically using a differential equation solver ode45 with fourth order runge kutta methods in matlab r2019a the math works inc the solving function used a variable time step with local error tolerance set to 10 6 each of these modeled factors and their equations are described in detail below 2 2 mathematical equations and operators 2 2 1 phytoplankton growth the phytoplankton specific growth rate u i was a multiplicative function of the most limiting nutrient light and temperature this relationship built on the work of studies where the specific phytoplankton growth rate was determined only by light and inorganic nutrient availability fasham et al 1990 huisman weissing 1995 diehl 2002 withrow et al 2018 by also considering the effect of temperature indeed studies have long discussed the importance of interactions between these three factors on phytoplankton growth eppley et al 1969 middlebrooks porcella 1971 in this work the most limiting nutrient was determined by applying liebig s law of minimum de baar 1994 to growth rates estimated from independent monod functions monod 1949 light limitation on the growth rate was also determined through application of a saturating function huisman weissing 1995 diehl 2002 differently the temperature based growth limitation was determined by the ratio of the growth rate given the temperature on a specific day and the growth rate at the optimal

zooplankton half saturation coefficient for grazing 106cells l 1 additionally zooplankton migration into the system from the benthos via hatching of resting stage eggs z r e s t was accounted for and the logic operator used to enable this takes the following form 19 i f t d t h a t c h and d l s e t then ψ 2 1 o t h e r w i s e ψ 2 0 where ψ 2 was a coefficient used to turn seasonal zooplankton migration on or off here hatching of zooplankton resting stage eggs was dependent on temperature and was modeled to replicate the hatching of eggs post ice off stimulated by temperatures typical of this time of year in temperate lakes cáceres 1998 cáceres schwalbach 2001 gyllström hansson 2004 2 4 nutrient n p concentration the concentration of nitrogen n and phosphorous p produced via grazer egestion s z e g e s t j and s z e g e s t j 1 respectively were determined as in roelke 2000 μm d 1 see eq 20 22 these equations and the logic statements applied to their solutions take the form 20 s

valid for study purposes once the non equilibrium steady state dynamics for a simulated year produced the prioritized conceptual model dynamics using plausible mechanisms as stated previously these dynamics included 1 a spring bloom of edible phytoplankton followed by a boom in zooplankton 2 a post bloom clear water phase 3 midyear phytoplankton succession resulting in less edible populations later in the year and 4 low overwinter plankton biomass a qualitative comparison of numerical and conceptual model dynamics for nutrient concentrations and plankton populations was made prior to further numerical model analyses and is reported in the results section analysis of mechanisms that contributed to specific simulated dynamics is incorporated into the discussion section 2 6 sensitivity analyses a sensitivity analysis was accomplished by comparing model results from simulations using the default parameter values based on relevant scientific literature listed in table 1 against results from simulations where a single parameter value was shifted either 50 or 50 we used this analysis to gauge the relative strength a mechanism or parameter that defined a mechanism had on model outcomes in other words if a shift in parameters defining a particular mechanism had a large effect on a system outcome like diversity then that parameter and mechanism were likely relatively important in some cases a 50 increase or decrease in a particular parameter was not meaningful so the shift in parameter value was altered these cases included the minimum of the edibility range εmin which was tested only by an increase from zero to 0 5 and the breakdown of the seasonal thermocline ϟend which was tested by an increase from 245 to the last day of the year 365 to achieve a stable non equilibrium state the model was run for 50 years for each simulation dynamics from the 50th year including both abiotic conditions and the dynamics of surviving plankton populations were then analyzed in detail biological parameters that were tested include per cell chl a content c minimum of the edibility ε range zooplankton maximum grazing rate gmax grazing threshold gthreshold seasonal

related response variables were measured for both the spring days 1 182 and fall day 183 365 assemblages 3 results 3 1 phytoplankton assemblage generation to generate a seasonal succession of faster growing more edible to slower growing less edible phytoplankton it was necessary to remove populations that fell along the middle of the life history characteristics gradient the details of this process were described in the methods section when intermediate populations were included in model simulations they dominated the yearly assemblage and autogenic succession between faster growing and slower growing populations did not occur fig 1 a top panels and 1b when the intermediates were removed populations nearest the gap i e those with the most intermediate characteristics were favored faster growing populations dominated in the spring and slower growing populations dominated in the summer through fall fig 1a bottom panels 3 2 abiotic model dynamics temperature followed a sinusoidal curve and varied from a low of 1 74 c increasing up to a high of 24 8 c near day 180 fig 2 a averaged mixed layer irradiance was primarily influenced by the onset and breakdown of system stratification which occurred on days 122 and 245 respectively fig 2 b during the period of system stratification the mixing depth decreased from 25 m to 8 m allowing cells to experience higher depth averaged irradiance this irradiance peaked near day 170 and then decreased gradually until the onset of fall mixing on day 275 when the depth integrated irradiance decreased drastically phytoplankton density also had an effect on water column irradiance causing a slight decrease due to high density near day 100 however the effect was small in relation to that of stratification status dissolved nutrient concentrations in the system were primarily influenced by phytoplankton growth and reductions in ambient concentration of n and p were observed during periods of elevated phytoplankton density fig 2 c mid year n concentrations were not depressed to the same extent as p due to grazer driven nutrient cycling resulting from a mismatch between the n and p content of the grazer and the cell quotas of the grazed cells i e phytoplankton contained more n relative to p than required by the grazer cell quota seasonal nutrient patterns included the buildup of nutrients in the system during the winter when phytoplankton density was low a rebound of nutrient concentrations during the clear water phase and phosphorus limitation post clear water phase and into the fall phytoplankton population abundances varied amongst and within populations over the simulated period of 50 years as the model self organized and populations unable to compete under the imposed conditions effectively went extinct fig 3 at the stable non equilibrium state simulated year 50 population abundances varied only over the course of a year fig 4 b and the conceptual peg model dynamics that had been stipulated a priori as important to reproduce see methods were demonstrated fig 4 c the stable assemblage was comprised of 5 populations 2 that were faster growing and 3 that were slower growing the faster growing populations had maximum growth rates of 2 34 2 35 d 1 and edibility of 0 754 0 759 the lowest growth rates and edibility at this end of the trait range while the slower growing populations had maximum growth rates of 0 938 0 951 0 965 d 1 and edibility of 0 236 0 241 0 246 the highest growth rates and edibility at this end of the trait range diversity amongst the surviving phytoplankton assemblage varied from 0 48 to 0 975 over the last simulated year fluctuations in phytoplankton population density were influenced by a combination of factors that varied seasonally in their magnitude of strength fig 4 a early on low temperatures and irradiance suppressed the growth of phytoplankton fig 4 a when these factors began to increase high ambient nutrient concentrations allowed explosive growth of the faster growing more edible populations densities of these fast growing populations peaked around day 100 fig 4 b and effectively sequestered system nutrients to the point that they limited growth fig 4 a in turn the highly edible phytoplankton assemblage stimulated zooplankton growth fig 4 b due to their high grazing rate the zooplankton exploited and subsequently suppressed the spring assemblage ushering in a clear water phase fig 4 b during this period the p concentration briefly began to rebound due to continued inflow coupled with low uptake by phytoplankton and n concentrations were restored through grazer driven nutrient recycling fig 2 c following the clear water phase low p primarily limited phytoplankton growth fig 4 a which allowed the slower growing populations with low half saturation coefficients to gain a competitive edge fig 4 b these populations dominated the phytoplankton throughout the rest of the year and because they were less edible the zooplankton population declined from its early spring maximum as the year ended all populations dropped to a seasonal low fig 4 b due to decreasing temperature and irradiance fig 4 a importantly these dynamics are also described as characteristics and driving mechanisms of the peg model and similarities between the two models are shown fig 4 b c 3 3 conceptual numerical model dynamics comparison here we compare the dynamics achieved using the simulation model to specific steps described in sommer et al 1986 and report whether the driving mechanisms initially prioritized for numerical model incorporation were sufficient to achieve the objective dynamics further consideration of processes driving simulation dynamics is presented in the discussion section using the numerical model we were able to produce the objective phytoplankton dynamics which included the simulation of a spring bloom of faster growing more edible phytoplankton followed by a boom in zooplankton these dynamics were previously described in steps 1 2 and 4 of the original conceptual peg model in this work the simulated fast growing phytoplankton are generic populations characterized by their growth nutrient uptake and edibility characteristics but in the conceptual model they are identified specifically as cryptophaceae and small centric diatoms the numerical model also simulated a zooplankton population boom driven by the high abundanance of their food source as suggested in the conceptual model initially hatching of resting stage eggs which was mentioned as contributing to an abundant spring zooplankton population in conceptual model step 2 was not included in the numerical model formulation however without this component the simulated zooplankton population effectively became extinct over the winter months so in the final model a simplistic representation of this process was included also using the numerical model we were able to generate a brief clear water phase following the spring bloom caused by high grazing rates this process was reported in step 5 of the conceptual model further we were able to demonstrate step 6 where zooplankton population density declined due to food limitation in the model simulation this process occured as the highly edible phytoplankton declined in abundance amongst the assemblage following the clear water phase mid year phytoplankton succession involved the replacement of faster growing populations with slower growing populations that dominated throughout the fall in the numerical model this process was related to nutrient competition under p limitation and grazing pressure the results correspond well with the processes described in steps 9 10 and 11 of the conceptual model during the fall and into the winter the simulation model produced the targeted dynamics of highly reduced plankton biomass there are interesting similarities and differences between the two models during this period in both models autogenic succession is disrupted though by different physical factors in the simulation model the less edible phytoplankton dominated the assemblage through the fall until all plankton biomass gradually declined to a wintertime low due to seasonally reduced light and temperature somewhat differently in the conceptual model fall mixing ended nutrient limited succession by reducing average light conditions and replenishing nutrient concentrations these events led to a fall assemblage dominated by low edibility mixing adapted phytoplankton species step 17 in the simulation model the onset of mixing which reduced light in the system did not have a pronounced effect on phytoplankton biomass following this period conceptual model steps 19 and 20 described the presence of a variable biomass of small edible species which contributed to a fall maximum of zooplankton the numerical model also generated a fall peak in the zooplankton population following an increased abundance of more edible phytoplankton an outcome related to predator prey cycling finally conceptual model steps 21 and 22 suggested that low or negative primary productivity as a result of low light led to a yearly low in phytoplankton biomass and in turn reduced food availability along with low temperatures caused zooplankton population lows 3 4 sensitivity and simulation analyses results of the sensitivity analysis were reported for simulations where the 50 change in the parameter resulted in a greater than 50 change in the response variable table 2 figures for parameters that had a widespread effect on the response variables were generated for 50th year model solutions shifted parameters for which multiple response variables were highly influenced include the minimum of the edibility range maximum zooplankton grazing rate and hydraulic flushing coefficient considering the minimum of the edibility range an increase in the original parameter value 0 to 0 5 had a positive effect on fall phytoplankton edibility 157 84 and a negative effect on fall phytoplankton richness 50 this outcome is logical given that the baseline fall assemblage was dominated by a low edibility phytoplankton population and by increasing the edibility minimum that population was lost from the modeled assemblage fig 5 b additionally increasing this parameter led to an 82 96 increase in the nutrient concentration um p occurring at peak phytoplankton density in the spring and a 512 66 increase during the fall peak fig 5 a again this was likely related to the loss of the low edibility population with low half saturation for nutrient limited growth value from the fall assemblage and the inability of the less rich assemblage to sequester nutrients to the same extent the maximum zooplankton grazing rate also had a widespread effect on model responses influencing almost all reported response variables a decrease in this parameter led to a 110 41 increase in phytoplankton edibility of the fall assemblage all persistent populations were from the more edible faster growing end of the trait gradient this was due to the ability of more edible populations to proliferate under reduced grazing pressure fig 6 the decreased grazing rate also caused a large increase 575 in phytoplankton richness of both the fall and spring assemblages fig 6 similarly phytoplankton population evenness and shannon diversity at peak phytoplankton density also increased intuitively a decrease in the maximum grazing rate led to a decrease 52 8 in peak zooplankton density fig 6 shifting the hydraulic flushing coefficient by 50 had more than a 100 effect on 5 of the 6 reported response variables increasing this parameter had a positive effect on fall phytoplankton edibility 97 08 and spring nutrient concentrations 759 25 and a negative effect on both spring and fall richness 50 and diversity 71 80 82 61 and fall evenness 65 23 fig 7 a c increased flushing caused slow growing less edible populations to become less abundant among the phytoplankton assemblage leading to decreased richness diversity and evenness additionally nutrient concentrations likely remained high for longer in the spring while the low density wintertime assemblage struggled against hydraulic displacement to gain a foothold decreasing the parameter by 50 led to large increases in both the fall and spring assemblages richness 100 as well as an increase in spring evenness 103 71 and diversity 205 57 fig 7 d this outcome was likely due to the ability of more populations to realize specific growth rates that were greater than the flushing rate and thereby persist in the system further decreasing this parameter caused a decrease in fall nutrient levels 56 32 likely due to increased richness and the ability of the more diverse assemblage to successfully sequester nutrients fig 7 b parameters that also effected a greater than 50 change in a response variable included the zooplankton specific mortality rate the half saturation for light limited growth and the seasonal thermocline set day increasing the zooplankton specific mortality rate allowed for an increase in edibility of the fall assemblage 96 35 again likely due to the ability of more edible populations to proliferate under reduced grazing pressure when the half saturation for light limited growth was increased the spring and fall nutrient concentrations also increased 58 78 56 94 when the parameter was reduced so too was the fall nutrient concentration 59 82 these relationships likely occurred due to the interrelated nature of phytoplankton nutrient sequestration and light limited growth reducing the seasonal thermocline set day caused a decrease in fall nutrient concentrations 50 83 the actual change in nutrient concentration is quite small 0 0086 to 0 0042 μm p but is likely related to increased fall phytoplankton density resulting from the earlier onset of stratification and increased irradiance in the

other driving mechanisms pulled from the scientific literature and which were largely described in sommer et al 1986 this is the first time to our knowledge that peg dynamics have been reproduced using a self organizing phytoplankton model the numerical model quantitatively reveals the relative roles of fundamental mechanisms that structure natural aquatic ecosystems reinforcing the significance of key biotic and abiotic system components in temperate aquatic ecosystems below we discuss the effects of these structuring mechanisms on peg dynamics and other model outcomes relating our findings to real world systems 4 1 early season light and temperature played a fundamental role in controlling plankton dynamics by suppressing growth of phytoplankton early in the year the light regime was influenced by shifting the onset and breakdown dates of seasonal stratification during the sensitivity analysis however the temporal shift in the dates of seasonal stratification did not have a pronounced effect on the system dynamics simulations run under the normal parameterization showed that the initiation of the phytoplankton spring bloom occurred prior to the onset of stratification these results suggest that the timing of seasonal stratification played a less important role relative to seasonally increasing temperature and irradiance in the spring the results are in part consistent with those discussed in the peg model sommer et al 1986 for moderately deep systems where stratification is not necessary for spring phytoplankton growth to occur however the peg model suggests vernal light increase to be the primary factor responsible for spring bloom initiation sommer et al 1986 sommer et al 2012 here we show that vernal temperature increase can play an important role limiting phytoplankton growth rates more so than light in the early part of the year this inconsistency between models may be due to a lack of both population specific temperature responses and incorporation of more cold adapted populations within the theoretical model phytoplankton characteristics that are relatively well known reynolds 2006 regardless others have shown that temperature plays an important role in determining timing of plankton dynamics scheffer et al 2001 berger et al 2010 4 2 spring bloom and clear water phase the numerical model demonstrated that as temperature and light became less limiting to phytoplankton growth the role of life history characteristics within the plankton community became dominant initially ecological trade offs within the phytoplankton assemblage i e high growth rate and edibility vs low half saturation coefficient determined assemblage structure fast growing edible populations were able to exploit the available nutrients and suppress the growth of slow growing less edible populations once highly edible phytoplankton populations were established the zooplankton grazing rate became important in shaping dynamics these two factors phytoplankton edibility and zooplankton grazing rate allowed for a boom bust predator prey dynamic to occur ultimately resulting in a clear water phase where phytoplankton biomass was suppressed by the grazer population interestingly our sensitivity analysis revealed that decreasing the zooplankton grazing rate shifted the system dynamics over time allowing for a more diverse assemblage of highly edible phytoplankton to occur in the spring in turn this led to the loss of a clear water phase 4 3 post clear water phase phosphorus limitation coupled with the surviving phytoplankton populations life history characteristics played an important role in determining system dynamics as the summer season commenced during this period a shift occurred where growth of the phytoplankton populations with lower half saturation coefficients were favored under the low p conditions due to the imposed ecological trade offs these populations were also less edible and their increased growth suppressed the more edible phytoplankton and zooplankton we can consider the transition an autogenic succession due to the role life history characteristics played in determining the outcome of competition further grazing can be ruled out as the lone driver of the successional event as evidenced by patterns in predator prey dynamics that occur during the same period these dynamics show dampened oscillations after the spring bloom within the zooplankton and edible phytoplankton populations which if uninterrupted would have led to an equilibrium between populations therefore the succession event can be attributed to the assigned ecological trade off that characterized the competitive abilities of the phytoplankton populations involved such ecological trade offs are thought to play a large role in the shaping of phytoplankton assemblages litchman et al 2007 however grazing pressure appears to have played some role in allowing the slow growing population to obtain a foothold demonstrated by the loss of this population when grazing was reduced such shifts in phytoplankton species composition have been widely reported and form the bedrock of much theory tilman 1982 sommer et al 1986 reynolds 1988 sommer 1989 4 4 late season as with the early season light and temperature played a fundamental role in controlling plankton dynamics by suppressing growth of phytoplankton late in the year these results are consistent with those discussed in the peg model sommer et al 1986 but again our results show that vernal temperature decrease played an important role more so than light in the late parts of the year shifting the minimum of the phytoplankton edibility range from 0 to 0 5 had a large effect on the fall plankton community which under the normal parameterization was dominated by the slow growing less edible population the shift meant that these slow growing populations were more edible to zooplankton and because there was no coupled shift in their growth rate one of the previously imposed ecological trade offs slow growth for inedibility was negated however the second trade off that of slow growth for low half saturation coefficient was maintained annulling one of the trade offs led to the loss of these populations from the surviving plankton assemblage and suggests that both low half saturation coefficients and inedibility may be important for the persistence of slow growing phytoplankton 4 5 the roles of inflow magnitude and hydraulic flushing hydraulic flushing within the model framework occurred at a constant rate and sensitivity analyses showed that the model was quite sensitive to large changes in the selected rate a 50 decrease in the flushing rate caused large increases in spring phytoplankton richness evenness and diversity and fall richness the shift in spring assemblage characteristics was caused by persistent populations of less edible phytoplankton through the winter months under the reduced flushing regime the slow growing populations experienced a longer residence time which allowed them to maintain dominance throughout the winter and comprise a large portion of the spring bloom in addition the zooplankton population was reduced due to the suppressed growth of the highly edible phytoplankton population such a pattern is consistent with observations from natural systems wherein harmful or nuisance species are more competitive when reduced flushing leads to longer residence times and prolonged periods of low nutrient concentrations smayda 2008 roelke pierce 2011 paerl et al 2016 increasing the flushing rate favored fast growing populations as might be expected and which has long been reported sommer 1989 reynolds 2006 this led to a decrease in the richness and diversity of both the fall and spring phytoplankton assemblages under this scenario though diversity was low system productivity increased due to the accelerated introduction of nutrients to the system which the faster growing phytoplankton populations could more readily exploit however low diversity systems have been shown at increased risk due to a reduction in functional redundancy and are therefore considered to be in a less desirable system state loreau et al 2001 the increase in flushing also effected the zooplankton population by more rapidly removing organisms from the system but this was offset by an increase in their specific growth rate due to the elevated density of highly edible phytoplankton this shift did not cause a large change in the zooplankton peak abundance but did allow the population to maintain a higher density for a prolonged period these results underscore the importance of environmental flows in determining phytoplankton assemblage characteristics sommer 1989 buyukates roelke 2005 and the need for consideration of such effects in the management of aquatic ecosystems 4 6 roles of zooplankton grazing and spring emergence the maximum zooplankton grazing rate had a pervasive effect on our model reducing this rate allowed phytoplankton a release from grazing pressure and led to a large increase in phytoplankton richness evenness and diversity as well as an increase in the edibility of the fall phytoplankton assemblage under this scenario the grazer was unable to over exploit the most edible populations in the system leading to their dominance over the entire year loss of the highly inedible species from the system and loss of the clear water phase these results emphasize the large top down effect that daphnid species have on phytoplankton assemblage structure jurgens 1994 additionally the results are consistent with empirical work showing that predation by planktivorous fish may greatly reduce the top down effect of these large grazers carpenter et al 1985 carpenter et al 2001 and like the theoretical work of scheffer et al 1997 we show that much of the seasonal density pattern for the zooplankton and phytoplankton populations can be explained via predator prey interactions forced by seasonal constraints also important to the persistence of the zooplankton population was the spring emergence of resting stage individuals into the system this immigration occurred in our model when a specified temperature was reached where we parameterized the temperature and the number of immigrating individuals based on empirical observations cáceres 1998 the immigration of individuals was necessary due to the effective extinction of zooplankton over the winter period during which time extreme low density of edible algae occurred in a natural system cáceres 1997 demonstrated that colonization from dormant eggs was important for populations that experienced both reliable and variable yearly recruitment success however others have shown that in systems with overwintering populations the relative contribution of hatched daphnia to the spring population is minimal unless the population is extremely low rother et al 2010 4 7 considerations for future work 4 7 1 life history traits phytoplankton populations in our model were influenced proportionally by temperature and irradiance where coefficients controlling these relationships were the same for all populations a scenario unlikely in natural systems we found that within the model framework used here population specific responses to temperature and irradiance were not necessary to achieve peg like dynamics modeling phytoplankton functional groups beyond fast growing edible populations and slower growing less edible populations as we ve done here will require greater complexity that accounts for population specific life history traits related to temperature and light in the equations depicting phytoplankton growth considering such population specific light and temperature effects would likely further partition the modeled niche space and result in greater phytoplankton diversity persisting over the simulated time period hutchinson 1961 indeed it has been shown that species affinities for specific light conditions can be used to predict the outcome of competition huisman et al 1999 and succession sommer 1989 litchman klausmeier 2001 exploration of such factors may lead to interesting insights concerning mechanistic drivers of plankton community response to climate change related forcing factors such as shifts in temperature and reduced light penetration due to the phenomenon of brownification solomon et al 2015 vasconcelos et al 2016 2019 the distribution of populations along the life history characteristics gradient should also be considered in the work presented here it was found that when populations were evenly spaced across the entire linear gradient only intermediate populations persisted and seasonal succession did not occur by redistributing populations with a gap in the middle of the range succession between populations at each end was feasible in a different self organized model system where the trait trade off was related to nutrient uptake efficiencies for n vs p and the ratio of n p in the nutrient supply fluctuated surviving populations in the emergent assemblage were distributed in clusters along the gradient when it was linear roelke spatharis 2015 when the trade off was curved the curvature determined the distribution of population clusters with more concave gradients resulting in clusters further towards the extremes deeper analysis revealed that the characteristics of the resource supply fluctuations were important in determining the distribution of clumps sakavara et al 2018 only when the resource concentrations fluctuated under a constant ratio or when delivery occurred at constant concentrations did a single cluster form in the model presented here resources were delivered at a constant rate and ratio and when there was no gap in the trade off gradient only a single cluster formed of intermediated populations by structuring the initial phytoplankton assemblage as two groups we created a scenario where species occurred in clusters it may be that our peg model would have self organized into species clusters as with the other models had we included fluctuation in the concentration of nutrients in the inflow or used a concave rather than linear trade off curve but that exploration is left for future research 4 8 pulsed inflows and nutrient loading stoichiometry in our model nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus were delivered at a constant rate and ratio as a function of hydraulic flushing though nutrient delivery in such a manner is unlikely to occur in natural systems where inflows vary seasonally we were able to achieve peg like dynamics with this physical framework in a way this allowed us to look past the noise that occurs in natural environments due to episodic inflows and nutrient loadings and discern clear patterns however pulsed nutrient delivery to aquatic ecosystems is an important system shaping process and much work has been dedicated to better understanding the effects of nutrient delivery timing sommer 1984 gaedeke sommer 1986 grover 1990 roelke et al 1999 anderson taylor 2001 buyukates roelke 2005 grover 2011 gatz 2019 in the work conducted here buildup of nutrients at least in the early spring coincided with periods when nutrient pulses would typically be delivered to the photic zone of dimictic systems through mixing of nutrient rich bottom waters induced by ice off sommer et al 1986 wetzel 2001 the ratio of nutrients delivered to a system is also influential in shaping aquatic ecosystems longstanding work has shown that resource ratio fluctuation patterns are important for maintenance of phytoplankton diversity tilman 1977 1982 sommer 1989 grover et al 1997 in addition more recent work has shown that these fluctuations are also important determinants of emergent phytoplankton assemblage characteristics roelke spatharis 2015 sakavara et al 2018 roelke et al 2020 therefore it is likely that incorporation of these mechanisms into the numerical model would lead to greater phytoplankton diversity due to finer scale niche partitioning generated by resource fluctuations over simulated time hutchinson 1961 4 9 other grazers grazing was a function of zooplankton density as well as the density and edibility of each phytoplankton population in our model parameterization for the zooplankton rates including growth grazing and nutrient quotas were based on that of the genus daphnia this allowed for the capture of mass effects within system dynamics that are described for natural systems i e the clear water phase as described in sommer 1989 but likely missed the smaller scale effects that smaller bodied and predatory grazers have on specific components of the phytoplankton assemblage sherr sherr 1987 müller et al 1991 roelke 2000 calbet landry 2004 sherr sherr 2007 löder et al 2011 adding zooplankton groups to the model with varied feeding preferences would likely increase the evenness and diversity of phytoplankton 4 10 variable cell quotas as stated previously we employed a gleaner opportunist trade off grover 1991 to define each phytoplankton population s competitive ability for nutrients but the realized growth rate of the populations also depended on the cellular characteristics that were the same across all phytoplankton the ratio of n p in the internal cell quota for n and p and cell volume a gross generalization here used to enable model tractability incorporation of nutrient cell quotas with a dynamic nutrient ratio would allow further exploration into the effect of shifted nutrient ratios in the inflow or specific phytoplankton nutrient acquisition strategies 5 conclusion herein we presented a mechanistic numerical model built with the objective to reproduce peg conceptual model dynamics though the model may be considered relatively complex within the realm of theoretical numerical models created for the purpose of better understanding ecological phenomenon it is simplistic when compared to many natural aquatic systems and the myriad of associated mechanisms working to shape them however it is this simplicity that makes the model s ability to reproduce well described dynamics striking and which reinforces the relative roles of the interacting factors and biological rules incorporated in it these factors and rules as they relate to model outcomes and reproduced natural phenomena are summarized in table 3 like the conceptual peg model this numerical model is useful for comparisons against systems from which it differs it is especially useful in such a context because the driving mechanisms are fully defined unlike those of natural systems further adjustments or additions can be used to easily test how the theoretical system may respond to shifted relative roles or altogether different driving mechanisms tools such as these may contribute to better understanding of complex natural systems

24529,the longstanding peg phytoplankton ecology group qualitative conceptual model describes generalized seasonal phytoplankton dynamics in temperate lakes and suggests important mechanisms driving these processes in the research presented here we re created the conceptual peg dynamics using a novel mechanistic numerical plankton model the numerical model incorporates only a handful of interacting factors and biological rules key model features include seasonally variable temperature mixing depth and light dynamic zooplankton and phytoplankton populations and multiple dynamic nutrient concentrations the model design is unique in that it incorporates a population rich phytoplankton assemblage where life history traits of members are based on ecological principles trade offs between traits allowing the assemblage to organize over time based on nutrient competition and grazing using 50th year solutions to the model solved with fourth order runge kutta methods i e a period when the dynamics had reached stable non equilibrium states sensitivity analyses were run by individually varying model parameters 50 and comparing the effect on model responses of interest simulation analyses revealed the important role light and temperature limitation played both early and late in the year controlling plankton biomass trade offs in phytoplankton life history characteristics determined the composition of the spring bloom under non nutrient limiting conditions fast growing edible populations dominated and the post clear water phase assemblage under low nutrient conditions slower growing less edible populations dominated grazer characteristics specifically rate of grazing and spring emergence determined the occurrence of the clear water phase and influenced the post assemblage composition where a clear water phase was absent when the grazing rate was low or spring emergence absent and the highly inedible populations were lost from the assemblage hydraulic flushing also played an important role where diminished inflow led to higher richness evenness and diversity due to greater overwintering of less edible taxa which influenced phytoplankton composition during spring bloom diminishing secondary productivity these results increase understanding of the relative roles of fundamental mechanisms structuring natural aquatic ecosystems and reinforce the significance of key biotic and abiotic system components of temperate lakes keywords peg model multi species model phytoplankton succession predator prey dynamics clear water phase ecological trade offs 1 introduction in 1986 the plankton ecology group peg published a qualitative conceptual model that has since become central to the study of aquatic ecology sommer et al 1986 the peg model describes general trends in the seasonal plankton dynamics of an intensively studied dimictic temperate lake and the key mechanisms driving those dynamics the conceptual model is outlined using a series of sequential steps which are then compared amongst several other well studied systems since its initial publication the model has served as a sort of architype against which aquatic system behavior can be compared in order to gain insight on mechanisms shaping specific systems and so the model has been put to the test many times in many different ways over the years sommer 1996 roelke et al 1997 scheffer et al 1997 jeppesen et al 2004 roelke et al 2004 sommer et al 2012 domis et al 2013 lv et al 2014 the peg conceptual model incorporated several ideas that are now considered textbook for example the authors suggested that both allogenic succession driven by non equilibrium seasonal factors and autogenic succession driven by biotic factors played important roles in determining plankton dynamics at different times over the course of a given year and that both bottom up resource availability as well as top down zooplankton grazing mechanisms shaped phytoplankton assemblage structure at various times more specifically for dimictic systems in which complete water column overturn holomixis occurs once in the spring and once in the fall it was suggested that spring mixing followed by the formation of a seasonal thermocline was important these events were thought to generate nutrient and light conditions that allowed for the initiation of a spring bloom a period of exponential growth of fast growing and highly edible phytoplankton this was followed by a clear water phase a well known phenomenon occurring in many temperate lakes thought to be caused by zooplankton over exploitation of a highly edible phytoplankton food source while top down grazing effects were considered responsible for clearing the water of phytoplankton biomass the bloom that initiated the zooplankton boom was fueled by the bottom up effect of high resource availability during the summer months a shallow mixed layer was thought to create conditions where autogenic phytoplankton succession driven by nutrient competition determined plankton dynamics finally fall mixing disrupted the stratified water column ending the primacy of autogenic succession and ensuing low light conditions throughout the winter months led to low plankton biomass resetting the yearly plankton successional trajectory since its initial publication several factors not mentioned or considered of lesser importance in the original peg model have received attention as important ecosystem shaping processes sommer et al 2012 these include but are not limited to the role of temperature adrian et al 2006 blenckner et al 2007 domis et al 2013 berger et al 2014 zohary et al 2020 overwintering of plankton cáceres 1998 gerten adrian 2002 sommer lewandowska 2011 hrycik

and higher trophic levels shapiro wright 1984 carpenter et al 1985 jeppesen et al 1997 hansson et al 1998 carpenter et al 2001 gliwicz 2003 in this research the objective was to build a simple numerical model that reproduced peg dynamics driven by mechanisms described in the conceptual model and then use the resulting model to better understand the relative importance of those mechanisms in shaping seasonal dynamics we focused on mechanisms that were described as relatively common amongst temperate lake systems and which involved only nutrients phytoplankton and zooplankton i e no fish while there are a myriad of existing numerical models that portray aspects of aquatic dynamics ranging from simple but insightful theoretical models e g npz see evans parslow 1985 franks et al 1986 to highly complex mechanistic systems models e g ce qual w2 general lake model see cole wells 2006 hipsey et al 2019 most of these models are either too simplistic e g include only one or two phytoplankton groups and few to no external forcing factors or are too complex for our purposes e g include detailed hydrodynamics and sediment processes further the model building process was considered an important aspect of this work in which forcing factors and mechanisms necessary to reproduce architype peg dynamics were identified therefore this work was initiated using a simple and widely used system comparable to an npz model where state variables include a nutrient concentration a phytoplankton population and a zooplankton population the simple base model was altered by adding many phytoplankton populations with life history traits that spanned a realistic gradient and which were based on ecological principles that created trade offs between traits we also incorporated both nitrogen and phosphorous as state variables seasonally variable temperature and mixing depth and both dynamic and seasonally variable light as model forcing factors the rational for these additions is discussed in the methods section the model design is unique in that population interactions e g competition for nutrients losses from grazing and forcing factors e g nutrient concentrations temperature light availability determine the composition of the emergent phytoplankton assemblage from a rich initial assemblage we considered this to result in a self organized assemblage differently npz and even highly complex model types have traditionally incorporated only a few phytoplankton populations using the model presented here parameterizations of the driving processes determined the traits that appeared in the emergent assemblage and those populations seasonal dynamics this allowed us to look at the model structure from which peg plankton dynamics emerged and better understand processes that produced that specific outcome further follow up sensitivity analyses demonstrated how the emergent assemblage traits and seasonal dynamics shifted under different conditions i e changes to the parameter values of driving processes others have also used a self organized modeling approach to investigate the relationship between emergent assemblage characteristics and complementarity in resource uptake traits roelke spatharis 2015 periodicity of fluctuating nutrient ratios sakavara et al 2018 and seasonal light variation bruggeman kooijman 2007 to create the model we focused on specific plankton dynamics described in the conceptual model and the mechanisms suggested as drivers these are further described in the methods section once the numerical model produced the prioritized dynamics using plausible mechanisms we conducted a qualitative comparison of the conceptual and numerical models as well as a sensitivity analysis of the numerical model both the model building process and the follow up analyses led to increased understanding of mechanisms driving the theoretical plankton dynamics and shed light on the relative importance that these factor may play in the seasonal changes observed in natural aquatic ecosystems we hope that the model can serve much as the original conceptual peg model has to test system behaviors that fall outside the dynamics created here and in doing so allow us to better understand conditions and mechanisms which give rise to them such work has become increasingly important as aquatic systems are faced with growing anthropogenic pressures and in many cases it is unclear how these complex systems will respond 2 methods 2 1 model description parameterization and differential equations to develop the numerical model the peg conceptual model was used as a guide as stated previously we focused on dynamics that involved nutrients phytoplankton and zooplankton and to keep the model as general as possible we considered seasonal dynamics that were widely common to the 21 lakes compared in sommer et al 1986 plankton dynamics described in the conceptual model that were considered important to reproduce using the numerical model included 1 a spring bloom of edible phytoplankton followed by a boom in zooplankton 2 a post bloom clear water phase 3 midyear phytoplankton succession resulting in less edible populations later in the year and 4 low overwinter plankton biomass in order to achieve the listed dynamics using the numerical model we prioritized the incorporation of mechanisms associated with specific seasonal events as described in the initial peg conceptual model sommer et al 1986 however it was recognized that different or additional mechanisms may need be incorporated if the objective dynamics could not be achieved the prioritized mechanisms included 1 average mixed layer light availability that was influenced by seasonally variable surface irradiance and mixing depth 2 temperature and light dependencies of phytoplankton growth rates 3 a trade off in phytoplankton life history characteristics where a high maximum growth rate under nutrient replete conditions also meant the given population would be more edible to zooplankton and less competitive under low nutrient conditions 4 the ability of the grazer population to clear relatively large volumes of water and exploit a highly edible food source the physical component of the numerical model is highly simplified employing a constant water volume with constant inflow bringing nutrients to the system because volume is constant outflow equals inflow the outflow removes nutrients and cells all model constants and variable ranges were parameterized using empirical data found in the literature and are reported in table 1 model formulations are further described below the phytoplankton assemblage included 100 populations with life history characteristics that spanned a gradient of values observed in natural systems this initial population richness was considered reasonable based on the work of roelke spatharis 2015 the model was initiated with these many populations so that organismal interactions and abiotic conditions determined the abundance and characteristics of the emergent assemblage more specifically phytoplankton dynamics were driven by competition for nutrients nutrient concentrations temperature and light influenced growth rates as well as grazing and dilution losses differential equations governing each phytoplankton population s density took the form 1 d a i d t a i u i h d z d t g i where a i was the phytoplankton density of population i 106cells l 1 u i was the specific growth rate of phytoplankton population i d 1 see eq 4 below h was the hydraulic flushing coefficient determined by dividing inflow by volume d 1 and g i was the rate at which phytoplankton population i was grazed 106cells indv 1 d 1 see eq 17 the phytoplankton populations were parameterized to reflect an ecologically based proportional relationship or trade off between each population s maximum growth rate u m a x i and it s edibility to the zooplankton population ei that is populations with lower u m a x i also had lower ei grover 1995 agrawal 1998 yoshida et al 2004 an additional ecologically based proportional relationship was imposed for each population between it s u m a x i and it s half saturation coefficient ksi j that is populations with higher u m a x i also had higher ksi j meaning they were less efficient at utilizing resources at low concentrations kilham kilham 1980 smayda 1980 as stated previously by creating a phytoplankton assemblage that spanned a gradient of characteristics and allowing them to self organize we gained insight into how specific characteristics and ecological relationships influenced a given population s competitive ability under various conditions initially the 100 phytoplankton populations were arranged along a linear gradient of evenly spaced growth rates ranging from 0 3 to 3 0 d 1 however we learned through simulation trials that peg dynamics were facilitated specifically the emergence of less edible populations later in the growing season when populations with intermediate traits were not a part of the initial phytoplankton assemblage therefore the results presented here were derived using 100 phytoplankton populations that were evenly spaced between 0 3 0 965 and 2 335 3 0 d 1 50 populations in each growth rate range for our purposes here if a population fell into the first range it was considered a slower grower and if it fell into the second range it was considered a faster grower temperature and light both proportionally influenced u m a x i and hydraulic displacement removed phytoplankton cells the zooplankton population was parameterized based on data for the genus daphnia a common and important component of the plankton assemblage in many freshwater systems which filter feeds and is capable of clearing large volumes of water when abundant this population s dynamics were driven by the edibility and abundance of each phytoplankton population we note here that future explorations of this model would benefit by employing many zooplankton taxa with life history traits spanning ecologically relevant gradients and allowing the zooplankton community to self organize similar to what we have done with phytoplankton here that however is beyond the scope of the current study parameter designations used for our daphnia zooplankton population are shown in table 1 the differential equation for the zooplankton populations took the form 2 d z d t d z d t u z m h ψ 2 z r e s t where z was the zooplankton population density indv l 1 µz was the specific growth rate for the zooplankton population d 1 see eq 15 m was the grazer population specific mortality rate d 1 ψ 2 was the coefficient enabling seasonal zooplankton hatching unit less see eq 19 and z r e s t was the zooplankton population density added through hatching indv l 1 d 1 abiotic factors of interest included averaged mix layer irradiance latitude temperature and nutrient concentrations for these parameterizations we relied on empirical observations from the well studied eutrophic temperate lake mendota located in wisconsin usa we recognize that these abiotic factors vary as a function lake morphometry position in the landscape including main axis orientation with predominate winds and elevation and characteristics of drainage basins supplying inflows to lakes we note here that future explorations of this model would benefit by employing variations in these but again that is beyond the scope of the current study nutrient concentrations were modeled as state variables with differential equations taking the form 3 d s j d t h s s r c j d s j d t i 0 n d a i d t u a i θ f i x a j s z e g e s t where s j was the ambient concentration of nutrient j µm s s r c j was the concentration of nutrient j in a

differential equations for the state variables 100 phytoplankton populations one zooplankton population and two nutrient concentrations were generated and solved numerically using a differential

modeled factors and their equations are described in detail below 2 2 mathematical equations and operators 2 2 1 phytoplankton growth the phytoplankton specific growth rate u i was a multiplicative function of the most limiting nutrient light and temperature this relationship built on the work of studies where the specific phytoplankton growth rate was determined only by light and inorganic nutrient availability fasham et al 1990 huisman weissing 1995 diehl 2002 withrow et al 2018 by also considering the effect of temperature indeed studies have long discussed the importance of interactions between these three factors on phytoplankton growth eppley et al 1969 middlebrooks porcella 1971 in this work the most limiting nutrient was determined by applying liebig s law of minimum de baar 1994 to growth rates estimated from independent monod functions monod 1949 light limitation on the growth rate was also determined through application of a saturating function huisman weissing 1995 diehl 2002 differently the temperature based growth limitation was determined by the ratio of the growth rate given the temperature on a specific day and the growth rate at the optimal temperature for phytoplankton growth the equation for specific growth rate u i takes the following form 4 u i u max i min d s j dt d s j dt k s i j d s j 1 dt d s j 1 dt k s i j 1 i z i z k i u t u t

valid for study purposes once the non equilibrium steady state dynamics for a simulated year produced the prioritized conceptual model dynamics using plausible mechanisms as stated previously these dynamics included 1 a spring bloom of edible phytoplankton followed by a boom in zooplankton 2 a post bloom clear water phase 3 midyear phytoplankton succession resulting in less edible populations later in the year and 4 low overwinter plankton biomass a qualitative comparison of numerical and conceptual model dynamics for nutrient concentrations and plankton populations was made prior to further numerical model analyses and is reported in the results section analysis of mechanisms that contributed to specific simulated dynamics is incorporated into the discussion section 2 6 sensitivity analyses a sensitivity analysis was accomplished by comparing model results from simulations using the default parameter values based on relevant scientific literature listed in table 1 against results from simulations where a single parameter value was shifted either 50 or 50 we used this analysis to gauge the relative strength a mechanism or parameter that defined a mechanism had on model outcomes in other words if a shift in parameters defining a particular mechanism had a large effect on a system outcome like diversity then that parameter and mechanism were likely relatively important in some cases a 50 increase or decrease in a particular parameter was not meaningful so the shift in parameter value was altered these cases included the minimum of the edibility range εmin which was tested only by an increase from zero to 0 5 and the breakdown of the seasonal thermocline ϟend which was tested by an increase from 245 to the last day of the year 365 to achieve a stable non equilibrium state the model was run for 50 years for each simulation dynamics from the 50th year including both abiotic conditions and the dynamics of surviving plankton populations were then

growing more edible to slower growing less edible phytoplankton it was necessary to remove populations that fell along the middle of the life history characteristics gradient the details of this process were described in the methods section when intermediate populations were included in model simulations they dominated the yearly assemblage and autogenic succession between faster growing and slower growing populations did not occur fig 1 a top panels and 1b when the intermediates were removed populations nearest the gap i e those with the most intermediate characteristics were favored faster growing populations dominated in the spring and slower growing populations dominated in the summer through fall fig 1a bottom panels 3 2 abiotic model dynamics temperature followed a sinusoidal curve and varied from a low of 1 74 c increasing up to a high of 24 8 c near day 180 fig 2 a averaged mixed layer irradiance was primarily influenced by the onset and breakdown of system stratification which occurred on days 122 and 245 respectively fig 2 b during the period of system stratification the mixing depth decreased from 25 m to 8 m allowing cells to experience higher depth averaged irradiance this irradiance peaked near day 170 and then decreased gradually until the onset of fall mixing on day 275 when the depth integrated irradiance decreased drastically phytoplankton density also had an effect on water column irradiance causing a slight decrease due to high density near day 100 however the effect was small in relation to that of stratification status dissolved nutrient concentrations in the system were primarily influenced by phytoplankton growth and reductions in ambient concentration of n and p were observed during periods of elevated phytoplankton density fig 2 c mid year n concentrations were not depressed to the same extent as p due to grazer driven nutrient cycling resulting from a mismatch between the n and p content of the grazer and the cell quotas of the grazed cells i e phytoplankton contained more n relative to p than required by the grazer cell quota seasonal nutrient patterns included the buildup of nutrients in the system during the winter when phytoplankton density was low a rebound of nutrient concentrations during the clear water phase and phosphorus limitation post clear water phase and into the fall phytoplankton population abundances varied amongst and within populations over the simulated period of 50 years as the model self organized and populations unable to compete under the imposed conditions effectively went extinct fig 3 at the stable non equilibrium state simulated year 50 population abundances varied only over the course of a year fig 4 b and the conceptual peg model dynamics that had been stipulated a priori as important to reproduce see methods were demonstrated fig 4 c the stable assemblage was comprised of 5 populations 2 that were faster growing and 3 that were slower growing the faster growing populations had maximum growth rates of 2 34 2 35 d 1 and edibility of 0 754 0 759 the lowest growth rates and edibility at this end of the trait range while the slower growing populations had maximum growth rates of 0 938 0 951 0 965 d 1 and edibility of 0 236 0 241 0 246 the highest growth rates and edibility at this end of the trait range diversity amongst the surviving phytoplankton assemblage varied from 0 48 to 0 975 over the last simulated year fluctuations in phytoplankton population density were influenced by a combination of factors that varied seasonally in their magnitude of strength fig 4 a early on low temperatures and irradiance suppressed the growth of phytoplankton fig 4 a when these factors began to increase high ambient nutrient concentrations allowed explosive growth of the faster growing more edible populations densities of these fast growing populations peaked around day 100 fig 4 b and effectively sequestered system nutrients to the point that they limited growth fig 4 a in turn the highly edible phytoplankton assemblage stimulated zooplankton growth fig 4 b due to their high grazing rate the zooplankton exploited and subsequently suppressed the spring assemblage ushering in a clear water phase fig 4 b during this period the p concentration briefly began to rebound due to continued inflow coupled with low uptake by phytoplankton and n concentrations were restored through grazer driven nutrient recycling fig 2 c following the clear water phase low p primarily limited phytoplankton growth fig 4 a which allowed the slower growing populations with low half saturation coefficients to gain a competitive edge fig 4 b these populations dominated the phytoplankton throughout the rest of the year and because they were less edible the zooplankton population declined from its early spring maximum as the year ended all populations dropped to a seasonal low fig 4 b due to decreasing temperature and irradiance fig 4 a importantly these dynamics are also described as characteristics and driving mechanisms of the peg model and similarities between the two models are shown fig 4 b c 3 3 conceptual numerical model dynamics comparison here we compare the dynamics achieved using the simulation model to specific steps described in sommer et al 1986 and report whether the driving mechanisms initially prioritized for numerical model incorporation were sufficient to achieve the objective dynamics further consideration of processes driving simulation dynamics is presented in the discussion section using the numerical model we were able to produce the objective phytoplankton dynamics which included the simulation of a spring bloom of faster growing more edible phytoplankton followed by a boom in zooplankton these dynamics were previously described in steps 1 2 and 4 of the original conceptual peg model in this work the simulated fast growing phytoplankton are generic populations characterized by their growth nutrient uptake and edibility characteristics but in the conceptual model they are identified specifically as cryptophaceae and small centric diatoms the numerical model also simulated a zooplankton population boom driven by the high abundanance of their food source as suggested in the conceptual model initially hatching of resting stage eggs which was mentioned as contributing to an abundant spring zooplankton population in conceptual model step 2 was not included in the numerical model formulation however without this component the simulated zooplankton population effectively became extinct over the winter months so in the final model a simplistic representation of this process was included also using the numerical model we were able to generate a brief clear water phase following the spring bloom caused by high grazing rates this process was reported in step 5 of the conceptual model further we were able to demonstrate step 6 where zooplankton population density declined due to food limitation in the model simulation this process occured as the highly edible phytoplankton declined in abundance amongst the assemblage following the clear water phase mid year phytoplankton succession involved the replacement of faster growing populations with slower growing populations that dominated throughout the fall in the numerical model this process was related to nutrient competition under p limitation and grazing pressure the results correspond well with the processes described in steps 9 10 and 11 of the conceptual model during the fall and into the winter the simulation model produced the targeted dynamics of highly reduced plankton biomass there are interesting similarities and differences between the two models during this period in both models autogenic succession is disrupted though by different physical factors in the simulation model the less edible phytoplankton dominated the assemblage through the fall until all plankton biomass gradually declined to a wintertime low due to seasonally reduced light and temperature somewhat differently in the conceptual model fall mixing ended nutrient limited succession by reducing average light conditions and replenishing nutrient concentrations these events led to a fall assemblage dominated by low edibility mixing adapted phytoplankton species step 17 in the simulation model the onset of mixing which reduced light in the system did not have a pronounced effect on phytoplankton biomass following this period conceptual model steps 19 and 20 described the presence of a variable biomass of small edible species which contributed to a fall maximum of zooplankton the numerical model also generated a fall peak in the zooplankton population following an increased abundance of more edible phytoplankton an outcome related to predator prey cycling finally conceptual model steps 21 and 22 suggested that low or negative primary productivity as a result of low light led to a yearly low in phytoplankton biomass and in turn reduced food availability along with low temperatures caused zooplankton population lows 3 4 sensitivity and simulation analyses results of the sensitivity analysis were reported for simulations where the 50 change in the parameter resulted in a greater than 50 change in the response variable table 2 figures for parameters that had a widespread effect on the response variables were generated for 50th year model solutions shifted parameters for which multiple response variables were highly influenced include the minimum of the edibility range maximum zooplankton grazing rate and hydraulic flushing coefficient considering the minimum of the edibility range an increase in the original parameter value 0 to 0 5 had a positive effect on fall phytoplankton edibility 157 84 and a negative effect on fall phytoplankton richness 50 this outcome is logical given that the baseline fall assemblage was dominated by a low edibility phytoplankton population and by increasing the edibility minimum that population was lost from the modeled assemblage fig 5 b additionally increasing this parameter led to an 82 96 increase in the nutrient concentration um p occurring at peak phytoplankton density in the spring and a 512 66 increase during the fall peak fig 5 a again this was likely related to the loss of the low edibility population with low half saturation for nutrient limited growth value from the fall assemblage and the inability of the less rich assemblage to sequester nutrients to the same extent the maximum zooplankton grazing rate also had a widespread effect on model responses influencing almost all reported response variables a decrease in this parameter led to a 110 41 increase in phytoplankton edibility of the fall assemblage all persistent populations were from the more edible faster growing end of the trait gradient this was due to the ability of more edible populations to proliferate under reduced grazing pressure fig 6 the decreased grazing rate also caused a large increase 575 in phytoplankton richness of both the fall and spring assemblages fig 6 similarly phytoplankton population evenness and shannon diversity at peak phytoplankton density also increased intuitively a decrease in the maximum grazing rate led to a decrease 52 8 in peak zooplankton density fig 6 shifting the hydraulic flushing coefficient by 50 had more than a 100 effect on 5 of the 6 reported response variables increasing this parameter had a positive effect on fall phytoplankton edibility 97 08 and spring nutrient concentrations 759 25 and a negative effect on both spring and fall richness 50 and diversity 71 80 82 61 and fall evenness 65 23 fig 7 a c increased flushing caused slow growing less edible populations to become less abundant among the phytoplankton assemblage leading to decreased richness diversity and evenness additionally nutrient concentrations likely remained high for longer in the spring while the low density wintertime assemblage struggled against hydraulic displacement to gain a foothold decreasing the parameter by 50 led to large increases in both the fall and spring assemblages richness 100 as well as an increase in spring evenness 103 71 and diversity 205 57 fig 7 d this outcome was likely due to the ability of more populations to realize specific growth rates that were greater than the flushing rate and thereby persist in the system further decreasing this parameter caused a decrease in fall nutrient levels 56 32 likely due to increased richness and the ability of the more diverse assemblage to successfully sequester nutrients fig 7 b parameters that also effected a greater than 50 change in a response variable included the zooplankton specific mortality rate the half saturation for light limited growth and the seasonal thermocline set day increasing the zooplankton specific mortality rate allowed for an increase in edibility of the fall assemblage 96 35 again likely due to the ability of more edible populations to proliferate under reduced grazing pressure when the half saturation for light limited growth was increased the spring and fall nutrient concentrations also increased 58 78 56 94 when the parameter was reduced so too was the fall nutrient concentration 59 82 these relationships likely occurred due to the interrelated nature of phytoplankton nutrient sequestration and light limited growth reducing the seasonal thermocline set day caused a decrease in fall nutrient concentrations 50 83 the actual change in nutrient concentration is quite small 0 0086 to 0 0042 μm p but is likely related to increased fall phytoplankton density resulting from the earlier onset of stratification and increased irradiance in the

other driving mechanisms pulled from the scientific literature and which were largely described in sommer et al 1986 this is the first time to our knowledge that peg dynamics have been reproduced using a self organizing phytoplankton model the numerical model quantitatively reveals the relative roles of fundamental mechanisms that structure natural aquatic ecosystems reinforcing the significance of key biotic and abiotic system components in temperate aquatic ecosystems below we discuss the effects of these structuring mechanisms on peg dynamics and other model outcomes relating our findings to real world systems 4 1 early season light and temperature played a fundamental role in controlling plankton dynamics by suppressing growth of phytoplankton early in the year the light regime was influenced by shifting the onset and breakdown dates of seasonal stratification during the sensitivity analysis however the temporal shift in the dates of seasonal stratification did not have a pronounced effect on the system dynamics simulations run under the normal parameterization showed that the initiation of the phytoplankton spring bloom occurred prior to the onset of stratification these results suggest that the timing of seasonal stratification played a less important role relative to seasonally increasing temperature and irradiance in the spring the results are in part consistent with those discussed in the peg model sommer et al 1986 for moderately deep systems where stratification is not necessary for spring phytoplankton growth to occur however the peg model suggests vernal light increase to be the primary factor responsible for spring bloom initiation sommer et al 1986 sommer et al 2012 here we show that vernal temperature increase can play an important role limiting phytoplankton growth rates more so than light in the early part of the year this inconsistency between models may be due to a lack of both population specific temperature responses and incorporation of more cold adapted populations within the theoretical model phytoplankton characteristics that are relatively well known reynolds 2006 regardless others have shown that temperature plays an important role in determining timing of plankton dynamics scheffer et al 2001 berger et al 2010 4 2 spring bloom and clear water phase the numerical model demonstrated that as temperature and light became less limiting to phytoplankton growth the role of life history characteristics within the plankton community became dominant initially ecological trade offs within the phytoplankton assemblage i e high growth rate and edibility vs low half saturation coefficient determined assemblage structure fast growing edible populations were able to exploit the available nutrients and suppress the growth of slow growing less edible populations once highly edible phytoplankton populations were established the zooplankton grazing rate became important in shaping dynamics these two factors phytoplankton edibility and zooplankton grazing rate allowed for a boom bust predator prey dynamic to occur ultimately resulting in a clear water phase where phytoplankton biomass was suppressed by the grazer population interestingly our sensitivity analysis revealed that decreasing the zooplankton grazing rate shifted the system dynamics over time allowing for a more diverse assemblage of highly edible phytoplankton to occur in the spring in turn this led to the loss of a clear water phase 4 3 post clear water phase phosphorus limitation coupled with the surviving phytoplankton populations life history characteristics played an important role in determining system dynamics as the summer season commenced during this period a shift occurred where growth of the phytoplankton populations with lower half saturation coefficients were favored under the low p conditions due to the imposed ecological trade offs these populations were also less edible and their increased growth suppressed the more edible phytoplankton and zooplankton we can consider the transition an autogenic succession due to the role life history characteristics played in determining the outcome of competition further grazing can be ruled out as the lone driver of the successional event as evidenced by patterns in predator prey dynamics that occur during the same period these dynamics show dampened oscillations after the spring bloom within the zooplankton and edible phytoplankton populations which if uninterrupted would have led to an equilibrium between populations therefore the succession event can be attributed to the assigned ecological trade off that characterized the competitive abilities of the phytoplankton populations involved such ecological trade offs are thought to play a large role in the shaping of phytoplankton assemblages litchman et al 2007 however grazing pressure appears to have played some role in allowing the slow growing population to obtain a foothold demonstrated by the loss of this population when grazing was reduced such shifts in phytoplankton species composition have been widely reported and form the bedrock of much theory tilman 1982 sommer et al 1986 reynolds 1988 sommer 1989 4 4 late season as with the early season light and temperature played a fundamental role in controlling plankton dynamics by suppressing growth of phytoplankton late in the year these results are consistent with those discussed in the peg model sommer et al 1986 but again our results show that vernal temperature decrease played an important role more so than light in the late parts of the year shifting the minimum of the phytoplankton edibility range from 0 to 0 5 had a large effect on the fall plankton community which under the normal parameterization was dominated by the slow growing less edible population the shift meant that these slow growing populations were more edible to zooplankton and because there was no coupled shift in their growth rate one of the previously imposed ecological trade offs slow growth for inedibility was negated however the second trade off that of slow growth for low half saturation coefficient was maintained annulling one of the trade offs led to the loss of these populations from the surviving plankton assemblage and suggests that both low half saturation coefficients and inedibility may be important for the persistence of slow growing phytoplankton 4 5 the roles of inflow magnitude and hydraulic flushing hydraulic flushing within the model framework occurred at a constant rate and sensitivity analyses showed that the model was quite sensitive to large changes in the selected rate a 50 decrease in the flushing rate caused large increases in spring phytoplankton richness evenness and diversity and fall richness the shift in spring assemblage characteristics was caused by persistent populations of less edible phytoplankton through the winter months under the reduced flushing regime the slow growing populations experienced a longer residence time which allowed them to maintain dominance throughout the winter and comprise a large portion of the spring bloom in addition the zooplankton population was reduced due to the suppressed growth of the highly edible phytoplankton population such a pattern is consistent with observations from natural systems wherein harmful or nuisance species are more competitive when reduced flushing leads to longer residence times and prolonged periods of low nutrient concentrations smayda 2008 roelke pierce 2011 paerl et al 2016 increasing the flushing rate favored fast growing populations as might be expected and which has long been reported sommer 1989 reynolds 2006 this led to a decrease in the richness and diversity of both the fall and spring phytoplankton assemblages under this scenario though diversity was low system productivity increased due to the accelerated introduction of nutrients to the system which the faster growing phytoplankton populations could more readily exploit however low diversity systems have been shown at increased risk due to a reduction in functional redundancy and are therefore considered to be in a less desirable system state loreau et al 2001 the increase in flushing also effected the zooplankton population by more rapidly removing organisms from the system but this was offset by an increase in their specific growth rate due to the elevated density of highly edible phytoplankton this shift did not cause a large change in the zooplankton peak abundance but did allow the population to maintain a higher density for a prolonged period these results underscore the importance of environmental flows in determining phytoplankton assemblage characteristics sommer 1989 buyukates roelke 2005 and the need for consideration of such effects in the management of aquatic ecosystems 4 6 roles of zooplankton grazing and spring emergence the maximum zooplankton grazing rate had a pervasive effect on our model reducing this rate allowed phytoplankton a release from grazing pressure and led to a large increase in phytoplankton richness evenness and diversity as well as an increase in the edibility of the fall phytoplankton assemblage under this scenario the grazer was unable to over exploit the most edible populations in the system leading to their dominance over the entire year loss of the highly inedible species from the system and loss of the clear water phase these results emphasize the large top down effect that daphnid species have on phytoplankton assemblage structure jurgens 1994 additionally the results are consistent with empirical work showing that predation by planktivorous fish may greatly reduce the top down effect of these large grazers carpenter et al 1985 carpenter et al 2001 and like the theoretical work of scheffer et al 1997 we show that much of the seasonal density pattern for the zooplankton and phytoplankton populations can be explained via predator prey interactions forced by seasonal constraints also important to the persistence of the zooplankton population was the spring emergence of resting stage individuals into the system this immigration occurred in our model when a specified temperature was reached where we parameterized the temperature and the number of immigrating individuals based on empirical observations cáceres 1998 the immigration of individuals was necessary due to the effective extinction of zooplankton over the winter period during which time extreme low density of edible algae occurred in a natural system cáceres 1997 demonstrated that colonization from dormant eggs was important for populations that experienced both reliable and variable yearly recruitment success however others have shown that in systems with overwintering populations the relative contribution of hatched daphnia to the spring population is minimal unless the population is extremely low rother et al 2010 4 7 considerations for future work 4 7 1 life history traits phytoplankton populations in our model were influenced proportionally by temperature and irradiance where coefficients controlling these relationships were the same for all populations a scenario unlikely in natural systems we found that within the model framework used here population specific responses to temperature and irradiance were not necessary to achieve peg like dynamics modeling phytoplankton functional groups beyond fast growing edible populations and slower growing less edible populations as we ve done here will require greater complexity that accounts for population specific life history traits related to temperature and light in the equations depicting phytoplankton growth considering such population specific light and temperature effects would likely further partition the modeled niche space and result in greater phytoplankton diversity persisting over the simulated time period hutchinson 1961 indeed it has been shown that species affinities for specific light conditions can be used to predict the outcome of competition huisman et al 1999 and succession sommer 1989 litchman klausmeier 2001 exploration of such factors may lead to interesting insights concerning mechanistic drivers of plankton community response to climate change related forcing factors such as shifts in temperature and reduced light penetration due to the phenomenon of brownification solomon et al 2015 vasconcelos et al 2016 2019 the distribution of populations along the life history characteristics gradient should also be considered in the work presented here it was found that when populations were evenly spaced across the entire linear gradient only intermediate populations persisted and seasonal succession did not occur by redistributing populations with a gap in the middle of the range succession between populations at each end was feasible in a different self organized model system where the trait trade off was related to nutrient uptake efficiencies for n vs p and the ratio of n p in the nutrient supply fluctuated surviving populations in the emergent assemblage were distributed in clusters along the gradient when it was linear roelke spatharis 2015 when the trade off was curved the curvature determined the distribution of population clusters with more concave gradients resulting in clusters further towards the extremes deeper analysis revealed that the characteristics of the resource supply fluctuations were important in determining the distribution of clumps sakavara et al 2018 only when the resource concentrations fluctuated under a constant ratio or when delivery occurred at constant concentrations did a single cluster form in the model presented here resources were delivered at a constant rate and ratio and when there was no gap in the trade off gradient only a single cluster formed of intermediated populations by structuring the initial phytoplankton assemblage as two groups we created a scenario where species occurred in clusters it may be that our peg model would have self organized into species clusters as with the other models had we included fluctuation in the concentration of nutrients in the inflow or used a concave rather than linear trade off curve but that exploration is left for future research 4 8 pulsed inflows and nutrient loading stoichiometry in our model nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus were delivered at a constant rate and ratio as a function of hydraulic flushing though nutrient delivery in such a manner is unlikely to occur in natural systems where inflows vary seasonally we were able to achieve peg like dynamics with this physical framework in a way this allowed us to look past the noise that occurs in natural environments due to episodic inflows and nutrient loadings and discern clear patterns however pulsed nutrient delivery to aquatic ecosystems is an important system shaping process and much work has been dedicated to better understanding the effects of nutrient delivery timing sommer 1984 gaedeke sommer 1986 grover 1990 roelke et al 1999 anderson taylor 2001 buyukates roelke 2005 grover 2011 gatz 2019 in the work conducted here buildup of nutrients at least in the early spring coincided with periods when nutrient pulses would typically be delivered to the photic zone of dimictic systems through mixing of nutrient rich bottom waters induced by ice off sommer et al 1986 wetzel 2001 the ratio of nutrients delivered to a system is also influential in shaping aquatic ecosystems longstanding work has shown that resource ratio fluctuation patterns are important for maintenance of phytoplankton diversity tilman 1977 1982 sommer 1989 grover et al 1997 in addition more recent work has shown that these fluctuations are also important determinants of emergent phytoplankton assemblage characteristics roelke spatharis 2015 sakavara et al 2018 roelke et al 2020 therefore it is likely that incorporation of these mechanisms into the numerical model would lead to greater phytoplankton diversity due to finer scale niche partitioning generated by resource fluctuations over simulated time hutchinson 1961 4 9 other grazers grazing was a function of zooplankton density as well as the density and edibility of each phytoplankton population in our model parameterization for the zooplankton rates including growth grazing and nutrient quotas were based on that of the genus daphnia this allowed for the capture of mass effects within system dynamics that are described for natural systems i e the clear water phase as described in sommer 1989 but likely missed the smaller scale effects that smaller bodied and predatory grazers have on specific components of the phytoplankton assemblage sherr sherr 1987 müller et al 1991 roelke 2000 calbet landry 2004 sherr sherr 2007 löder et al 2011 adding zooplankton groups to the model with varied feeding preferences would likely increase the evenness and diversity of phytoplankton 4 10 variable cell quotas as stated previously we employed a gleaner opportunist trade off grover 1991 to define each phytoplankton population s competitive ability for nutrients but the realized growth rate of the populations also depended on the cellular characteristics that were the same across all phytoplankton the ratio of n p in the internal cell quota for n and p and cell volume a gross generalization here used to enable model tractability incorporation of nutrient cell quotas with a dynamic nutrient ratio would allow further exploration into the effect of shifted nutrient ratios in the inflow or specific phytoplankton nutrient acquisition strategies 5 conclusion herein we presented a mechanistic numerical model built with the objective to reproduce peg conceptual model dynamics though the model may be considered relatively complex within the realm of theoretical numerical models created for the purpose of better understanding ecological phenomenon it is simplistic when compared to many natural aquatic systems and the myriad of associated mechanisms working to shape them however it is this simplicity that makes the model s ability to reproduce well described dynamics striking and which reinforces the relative roles of the interacting factors and biological rules incorporated in it these factors and rules as they relate to model outcomes and reproduced natural phenomena are summarized in table 3 like the conceptual peg model this numerical model is useful for comparisons against systems from which it differs it is especially useful in such a context because the driving mechanisms are fully defined unlike those of natural systems further adjustments or additions can be used to easily test how the theoretical system may respond to shifted relative roles or altogether different driving mechanisms tools such as these may contribute to better understanding of complex natural systems
