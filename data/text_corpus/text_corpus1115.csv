5575,destructive flash floods and debris flows are a common menace following wildfire the restoration of protection provided by forests from post fire floods and debris flows depends on the recovery of infiltration and attendant reduction of infiltration excess surface runoff generation this work examines seven years of post fire infiltration measurements and temporal relations fit to soil hydraulic properties from the colorado front range usa to assess infiltration recovery with increasing time since fire point scale green ampt simulations of infiltration across a full spectrum of rainfall events are used to evaluate infiltration changes and shifts in surface runoff generation thresholds with post fire temporal recovery measured and simulated infiltration generally recovered monotonically with increasing time since fire this indicates a reduced vulnerability to infiltration excess runoff generation as time elapses with the greatest risk in the first two years after the fire the threshold for infiltration excess runoff advances with increasing time to rainfall events with higher intensity and greater return intervals by the third year after wildfire only extreme events 30 100 year recurrence generate surface runoff and by the fifth and seventh year even extreme rainfall events typically fail to generate surface runoff remotely sensed vegetation indices indicate linked or at least contemporaneous recovery of understory vegetation and field saturated hydraulic conductivity at this field site suggesting coincident recovery of multiple hillslope properties impacting surface runoff generation this work indicates the importance of coupled assessments of hillslope property recovery and stochasticity of high intensity rainfall for flash flood and debris flow hazards arising from infiltration excess runoff generation these hazards likely shift to subsurface mechanisms with increasing time since fire post fire hazard assessments using static hillslope properties could fail to predict flash floods and debris flows associated with infrequent extreme rainfall events that strike during the post fire recovery period when hillslope properties are partially recovered keywords wildfire infiltration flash flood debris flow window of disturbance disturbance hydrology 1 introduction wildfire increases the probability of flash floods and debris

reductions in interception and surface roughness can promote surface runoff generation infiltration rate decreases are a major control on water related hazards after wildfire driven by surface runoff generation processes the duration of elevated risk of post wildfire flood and debris flow hazards is of tremendous interest to emergency managers the ability of a watershed to protect communities from floods and debris flows is an ecosystem service of regulation e g brauman et al 2007 where the hydrologic function of the watershed to partition store and release water supplied by rainfall black 1997 wagener et al 2007 may be compromised by wildfire the duration of the hydrologic function impairment and consequent loss of the regulation ecosystem service tends to be concentrated in the first few years following fire runoff initiated debris flow hazards following wildfire are often focused in the first 1 2 years after wildfire cannon et al 2009 meyer et al 2001 santi and morandi 2013 a study by degraff et al 2015 showed that 85 of post wildfire debris flows took place within the first 12 months after fire in the western u s the largest impacts for flash flood generation are also typically observed in the two years after fire e g ferreira et al 2009 moody and martin 2001a prosser and williams 1998 stoof et al 2012 this trend is consistent with the window of disturbance concept fig 1 which postulates a time period of elevated hydrologic and geomorphologic response from several months to several years following fire esteves et al 2012 sass et al 2012 shakesby et al 1994 swanson 1981 vieira et al 2016 wittenberg and inbar 2009 with responses tending to decline in magnitude with increasing time since fire hillslope properties such as infiltration rate ground cover and canopy interception tend to start off relatively high before the fire decline precipitously as a result of the fire and then recover over time fig 1 these hillslope properties recover relative to the hydrologic driver of high intensity rainfall until the hydrologic response declines substantially and the time period of greatest vulnerability has passed the window of disturbance has closed fig 1 the post wildfire hydrologic response however does not always decrease monotonically with increasing time since fire a number of post fire investigations have noted that drought or low intensity rainfall events can result in a minimal initial post wildfire runoff response florsheim et al 2017 mayor et al 2007 prats et al 2015 prior work has also shown that extreme rainfall events can cause major flooding and debris flows years after wildfire when the main threat is thought to be over e g booker 1998 ebel et al 2016 murphy et al 2018 pearthree and youberg 2006 schmeer et al 2018 at some locations the post fire rainfall temporal variability has proven to be a stronger factor than time since fire for surface runoff and associated erosion inbar et al 1998 robichaud et al 2008 vieira et

murphy et al 2015 by contrast predictions of post wildfire hazards in the us such as flash floods elliot 2012 foltz et al 2009 moody 2011 and debris flows cannon et al 2011 staley et al 2013 staley et al 2017 often do not account for hillslope property recovery and the associated changes in runoff generation thresholds dictated by stochastic rainfall clearly the aforementioned flash flood and debris flow prediction efforts provide critical warnings of the most common hazards that are present in the first two years after wildfire however they may miss hazards associated with infrequent extreme rainfall events that strike during the post fire recovery period this points to the need for further assessments coupling hillslope property recovery and runoff response to quantitatively predict the temporal evolution of hydrologic hazards with time since wildfire that provide guidance across the full hydroclimatologic spectrum such efforts will shed light on when the window of disturbance is closed relative to elevated surface runoff generation and associated hydrologic hazards prediction of the duration of surface runoff driven hazards with increasing time since fire could be improved by including both hillslope property recovery and accounting for the stochastic nature of high intensity rainfall this work considers three questions regarding the duration of increased vulnerability of generating elevated infiltration excess runoff after wildfire 1 do hillslope soil hydraulic properties that control infiltration excess runoff generation generally increase monotonically with increasing time since fire thus reducing the propensity for surface runoff 2 can a simple relation be formulated to reasonably estimate soil hydraulic properties with increasing time since fire to enable prediction of shifts in infiltration excess runoff generation as time elapses 3 how does recovery of infiltration with increasing time after fire affect simulated runoff generation and change implications for predicting flash flood and debris flow hazards these questions are addressed through measurements of the temporal evolution from 0 to 7 years following wildfire of point scale 1 m2 infiltration that controls surface runoff generation by the infiltration excess mechanism soil hydraulic properties were estimated using infiltration theory to estimate field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs mm h 1 and sorptivity mm h 0 5 which are used to assess the efficacy of a simple relation for estimating soil hydraulic properties as a function of time since fire finally shifts in thresholds of infiltration excess runoff generation with time since wildfire are simulated using a simple point scale model the green ampt approach parameterized soil hydraulic property estimates across a site specific spectrum of rainfall events with recurrence intervals from 1 to 1000 years 2 methods 2 1 field area the field area for this investigation is within the region affected by the 2010 fourmile canyon fire near boulder colorado usa 40 031587 105 403174 burned i e fire affected and unburned hillslopes with approximately north facing aspects 20 for burned 330 for unburned at elevations ranging from 2400 50 m above sea level are the focal point of this study fig 2 the burned site was selected for high burn severity terminology following keeley 2009 considering both vegetation canopy and soil visual criteria from parsons et al 2010 and the remotely sensed burn severity metric called the change in the normalized burn ratio dnbr which was 834 moody et al 2016 the values for dnbr typically range from 100 unburned to 1000 high burn severity moody et al 2016 pre wildfire vegetation would have been typical of a colorado front range montane ecosystem on a north facing slope featuring aspen populus tremuloides rocky mountain douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii subspecies glauca and limber pine pinus flexilis fest 2010 soils on north facing slopes in this area tend to have thin o horizons underlain by b and c horizons and are classified as cryalfs or ustalfs birkeland et al 2003 the soil texture is classified as gravelly sand ebel 2012 the climate is classified as continental pepin 2000 with most precipitation falling as snow from late fall to spring cyclonic rainstorms in late spring and fall and convective rainstorms in summer 2 2 estimates of soil hydraulic properties soil hydraulic properties were estimated by using repeated infiltration measurements with increasing time since the 2010 wildfire measurements were collected at burned sites in 2010 2013 2015 and 2017 and at nearby unburned sites approximately 500 m away in 2010 2013 and 2015 table 1 fig 3 a e infiltration measurement locations were clustered with 3 4 measurements per cluster separated by 0 5 1 5 m and clusters separated by approximately 15 20 m clusters were located near automated soil water content sensors ebel 2013 on the hillslope specific measurement locations were constrained by avoiding logs tree stumps rocks roots and regrowing understory vegetation thus measurement locations represented opportunistic sampling that may result in bias measurements in successive years are not in exactly the same physical location to avoid local site disturbance associated with the measurement the number of measurements varied but typically was about 15 table 1 for most of the measurement snapshots in time all except 2015 soil water content was also measured using the thermogravimetric method of heating soil for 24 hrs at 105 c topp and ferré 2002 soil water content in 2015 was estimated as the mean value on the day of measurement at 5 cm depth from automated soil water content sensors decagon devices 5tm at the burned and unburned locations soil hydraulic properties of kfs and sorptivity were estimated by using a tension infiltrometer decagon devices minidisc set to 1 cm of tension in situ in the field the 1 cm of tension was selected because of the coarse textural classification of the soil that suggests a rapidly changing hydraulic conductivity function near saturation the 1 cm was the tension nearest to saturation that could be reliably reproduced using the mariotte tube apparatus in the tension infiltrometer in the field a sharpened thin walled stainless steel core 6 cm length 4 8 cm diameter was driven into the ground flush with the surface and coupled to the infiltrometer using a flexible plastic sleeve in 2010 and 2013 litter and duff were removed at the unburned measurement locations prior to measurements the tension infiltrometer was then placed directly on bare soil fig 3b at the burned and unburned locations fig 3e vegetation regrowth in 2015 fig 3c and 2017 fig 3d necessitated the use of contact sand to couple the infiltrometer base to the soil in 2015 and 2017 for the burned locations for consistency the contact sand was also used in 2015 in the unburned locations but the litter and duff were not removed prior to measurements conversion of measured infiltration rates into estimates of soil hydraulic properties requires analyzing measurements using an infiltration equation the differentiated linearization method vandervaere et al 2000a vandervaere et al 2000b was used to estimate kfs and sorptivity for 2010 2013 2015 and 2017 using the one dimensional 1d vertical infiltration approach from philip 1957 the use of the 1d approximation was facilitated by the installation of the steel core that enforces 1d vertical flow in 2010 8 out of the 12 measurements had zero infiltration i e no bubbles from the mariotte tube in 15 20 min the infiltration is not truly zero but instead a very small value that is difficult to measure using the tension infiltrometer in the field to approximate a maximum value for these 2010 burned soil measurements where zero infiltration was measured a simple estimate was made using basic assumptions first the typical bubble volumes were estimated to be 0 15 0 20 ml which was approximated using the midpoint of this range 0 175 ml this volume was then converted into a cumulative infiltration of 0 11 mm using the minidisc infiltrometer specifications the one dimensional approximation for cumulative infiltration philip 1957 vandervaere et al 2000a vandervaere et al 2000b was used only for the 2010 burned estimates where infiltration was zero to estimate kfs and sorptivity assuming that infiltration was partitioned 10 into the sorptivity and 90 into the kfs terms the 10 partitioning of infiltration into sorptivity was conceptualized to represent the minimal influence of sorptivity in infiltration immediately after wildfire ebel and moody 2017 moody et al 2009 nyman et al 2010 the maximum sorptivity during the 2010 burned measurements where zero infiltration was recorded is 0 02 mm h 0 5 and the maximum kfs is 0 7 mm h 1 for all measurements kfs was estimated assuming that the β parameter was 0 6 haverkamp et al 1994 note that only measurements for which kfs and sorptivity are both positive were used in this work which is why there may be a difference between the number of measurements in table 1 and the number of kfs and sorptivity values in a given year sorptivity can be estimated to be negative in the differentiated linearization method because it is the intercept in a linearized equation such that when sorptivity is near zero the intercept can be slightly negative only two estimates had negative sorptivity values and both were in the unburned area one in 2010 and one in 2015 table 1 a negative kfs is most often the result of a layered near surface system where kfs decreases in the lower layer only one estimate had a negative kfs which was located in the burned area in 2015 table 1 negative sorptivity or kfs values affected only 3 out of 85 measurements 4 infiltration processes can become complicated after wildfire by issues such as soil water repellency resulting in non standard temporal patterns of infiltration e g chen et al 2020 imeson et al 1992 while the philip equation approach used here does not explicitly include these processes it is used here to estimate soil hydraulic properties in the context of an effective parameter the kfs and sorptivity estimates were used to estimate the green ampt wetting front potential ψf mm to facilitate simulating the infiltration response to specific rainfall rates and durations the ψf was estimated using the equation ebel and moody 2017 1 ψ f s 2 2 k fs θ s where s is sorptivity θs is the saturated soil water content equation 1 assumes that the initial soil water content θi is very small relative to θs such that the difference between θs and θi can be approximated as simply θs and that the initial hydraulic conductivity ki is much smaller than kfs such the difference between kfs and ki can be approximated as kfs in this work it was assumed that the estimated soil hydraulic properties are isotropic the term field saturated with regards to hydraulic conductivity is intended to distinguish between the vacuum saturated conditions established in laboratory measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks mm h 1 and the conditions typical in field measurements or laboratory measurements in near saturated conditions where small amounts of entrapped air are present in the soil reynolds et al 1983 prior work has shown a factor of two difference between ks and kfs bouwer 1966 stephens et al 1984 stephens et al 1983 with ks being greater and some investigators have opined that kfs better represents hydraulic conductivity during infiltration in field conditions the field saturated term also denotes that water repellency impacts are included in the non ponded k estimate langhans et al 2016a nyman et al 2010 philip 1969 has noted that sorptivity should be expressed relative to a defined change in pressure head ψ or θ between an initial and final condition reflecting the initial soil water status and the boundary conditions the initial and final ψ or θ were not measured at every location thus sorptivity measurements reported here can only be referenced relative to the average θ measurements taken at the field sites that approximate the initial condition the potential differences in initial and final ψ and θ should be considered when interpreting differences in sorptivity estimates for different years at this field area and also when comparing to estimates from other field sites geometric means are used to represent the central tendencies of the soil hydraulic properties in this work for data that are approximately log normally distributed like ks freeze and cherry 1979 talsma and hallam 1980 and some unsaturated soil hydraulic properties kosugi 1996 in unburned environments the geometric mean is more representative as a central tendency than the arithmetic mean while some research has shown that ks is not log normally distributed after wildfire langhans et al 2016a it can be nearly log normally distributed ebel 2019 and the geometric mean has been used as a representative ks value in post wildfire hydrologic modeling ebel et al 2016 2 3 simple relation for estimating soil hydraulic properties with time since fire the window of disturbance concept puts forth the idea that post fire hydrologic and geomorphic response declines with increasing time since fire after a period of greatest impacts immediately after fire fig 1 in a meta analysis of kfs recovery as a function of time ebel and martin 2017 introduced an expression to represent kfs with time since fire that is broadly consistent with the window of disturbance model the non linear logistic relation proposed by ebel and martin 2017 was designed to represent variables with an initial exponential growth that asymptote to a stable value 2 k fs t k ub k bto e rt k ub k bto e rt 1 where t is time since fire years kbto mm h 1 is the minimum kfs value assumed to be at the time immediately after the fire to kub mm h 1 is the unburned kfs that is presumed to provide an asymptotic upper limit and r is a parameter governing the rate of recovery year 1 important assumptions embedded in equation 2 include that i fire effects do not increase kfs such that after a long time of recovery that kfs t does not exceed kub ii the term unburned is actually denoting a long unburned condition shakesby et al 1993b iii the minimum kfs is present immediately after fire at to iv an ash layer that could be present at the surface is not explicitly represented v it is presumed that an effective kfs including matrix and macropore influences as well as water repellency effects can be determined and is representative across scales and vi kfs can recover to kub within a finite time frame after fire rather than being permanently degraded these are not trivial assumptions but provide an initial method for framing how central tendencies such as the geometric mean of soil hydraulic property recovery could be quantified with time since fire in this work the efficacy of eq 2 for representing measured kfs sorptivity and ψf with increasing time since fire was evaluated fitting for sorptivity or ψf also used eq 2 replacing hydraulic conductivity terms with sorptivity or ψf values the r parameters in eq 2 were fitted to all the burned data not the mean or geometric mean using the curve fit function in the scipy optimize package release 1 3 0 in python 3 7 1 kbto was set to the geometric mean in 2010 immediately after the wildfire table 2 kub was set to the unburned geometric mean from the 2015 data table 2 2 4 infiltration modeling infiltration modeling using estimates of soil hydraulic properties provides a context to consider how rainfall of differing rates durations and associated recurrence intervals promotes infiltration excess runoff generation with increasing time since fire as hillslope properties recover infiltration into mineral soil was simulated by using the green ampt approach green and ampt 1911 based upon the constant rainfall rate implementation by mein and larson 1973 the green ampt approach has been widely used to simulate post wildfire infiltration and runoff generation e g rengers et al 2016b van eck et al 2016 woods and balfour 2008 yates et al 2001 the soil hydraulic properties kfs and ψf from each infiltration measurement were used to parameterize a green ampt simulation for that point across the spectrum of rainfall rates for different recurrence intervals assuming that initial conditions prior to rainfall are relatively dry causing the initial hydraulic conductivity ki mm h 1 at the initial soil water content θi cm3 cm 3 to be very small and negligible relative to ks mm h 1 the time to ponding tp h can be approximated 3 t p i p r ψ f k s θ s θ i r r k s where ip is the cumulative infiltration at ponding mm r is the rainfall rate mm h 1 ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and θs cm3 cm 3 is the saturated soil water content the ip at tp can be estimated as 4 i p ψ f k s θ s θ i r k s when cumulative infiltration i mm is ip the time t for a given i t is 5 t i r and when i t ip t is 6 t t p 1 k s i i p ψ f θ s θ i l n ψ f θ s θ i i p ψ f θ s θ i i the infiltration rate as a function of time i t when t tp is r and when t tp is 7 i t k s 1 ψ f θ s θ i i equation 3 was used to estimate tp across a spectrum of rainfall recurrence intervals to analyze the shifts with increasing time since fire two characteristic rainfall durations were focused on which are the 15 minute i 15 and 30 minute i 30 rainfall rates that have been shown to be related to post fire debris flow kean et al 2011 staley et al 2017 and flash flood moody and martin 2001b generation respectively equation 7 was then used along with eqs 3 6 to examine runoff coefficients across rainfall recurrence intervals for i 15 and i 30 and also consider ponded infiltration rates across rain storms of different exceedance probabilities with the associated rainfall rates and durations for a given exceedance probability to examine the infiltration excess runoff generation likelihood at this specific field area the initial condition θi was set to 0 02 for all years which was the average immediate post fire soil water content ebel et al 2012 and θs was set to 0 46 for the unburned soil and 0 49 for the burned soil based on saturated soil water contents measured to construct soil water retention curves at the same locations as the tension infiltrometer measurements ebel 2012 using the same θi across all years provides a consistent basis for comparison of simulations with increasing time since fire to isolate the soil infiltration response into mineral soil no canopy or litter duff interception was included for either the unburned or burned simulations depression storage was assumed to be zero for these point scale simulations and routing was not considered the green ampt approach as implemented here assumes that the soil is homogeneous and isotropic with respect to soil properties a sharp wetting front is present matric potential at the wetting front remains constant as the front progresses downward rainfall rate is constant with time uniform θi and that θ is uniform behind the wetting front mein and larson 1973 tindall and kunkel 1999 the green ampt assumptions may be problematic in burned soils where wetting fronts may be unstable e g stoof et al 2014 in this work the green ampt model provides an approximation of infiltration and runoff generation to compare runoff generation with increasing time since fire the interface between the soil and weathered bedrock is not represented in the infiltration modeling flow of the air phase during infiltration morel seytoux and khanji 1974 is neglected here the assumptions regarding the k as a function of saturation are the primary difference between the green ampt approach and other infiltration approaches parlange et al 1982 smith and parlange 1978 commonly used in post wildfire hydrologic modeling smith et al 2002 green ampt assumes a delta function diffusivity meaning that the changes in k are constant near saturation whereas the smith and parlange 1978 approach uses an exponentially decreasing k as saturation decreases and the parlange et al 1982 approach has a flexible functional form all three of these infiltration models include effects of gravity and capillarity as the driving forces of infiltration with the partitioning and efficacy determined by the model parameters representative rainfall rates at difference recurrence intervals of 1 10 100 and 1000 years fig 4 a and b for this area were selected from the noaa atlas 14 web interface perica et al 2015 https hdsc nws noaa gov hdsc pfds pfds map cont html bkmrk ne the precipitation rate frequency estimates are derived from frequency analysis of partial duration series the minimum rainfall duration analyzed by perica et al 2015 was 5 min and the maximum duration was 60 days 2 5 remotely sensed hillslope properties for vegetation and ground cover recovery infiltration recovery after wildfire is linked in some areas to understory vegetation recovery and reestablishment of ground cover the combination of understory vegetation and litter cover is subsumed into the term ground cover in some studies e g robichaud 2005 because understory vegetation and ground cover were not quantified in the field at this site trends are instead estimated using remotely sensed metrics the two metrics used here are the leaf area index lai and enhanced vegetation index evi from the nasa moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products https terra nasa gov about terra instruments modis the modis lai is defined for broadleaf canopies as the one sided green leaf area per unit ground area and for coniferous canopies as half the total needle surface area per unit ground area resulting in units of m2 m 2 myneni et al 2015 the modis evi is derived from atmospherically corrected reflectance in the red near infrared and blue wavebands which minimizes canopy soil variations and improves sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions didan et al 2015 these indices are provided at 500 m resolution which may include areas of lower burn severity near the burned area modis vegetation indices have been used in prior studies to assess vegetation recovery in burned areas bright et al 2019 jin et al 2012 moreno et al 2019 june is the period of peak evi and lai in this area and only june through september data were used to avoid snow cover issues 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis facilitates evaluating differences between burned and unburned soil hydraulic properties within the same year and between years the kruskal wallis test was used to assess population differences for equality of medians kruskal and wallis 1952 a threshold p value of 0 05 was used to reject the null hypothesis of equivalent medians the scipy stats package release 1 3 0 in python 3 7 1 was used for all statistical analysis 3 results 3 1 estimated soil hydraulic properties the soil hydraulic property of kfs was smallest in 2010 immediately following the wildfire and increased with progressively longer time after the fire burned kfs was extremely small in 2010 table 3 fig 5 reflecting the 8 out of 12 measurements that had zero infiltration during measurement the sole unburned kfs estimate in 2010 was orders of magnitude larger 169 mm h 1 table 3 fig 5 because there were insufficient unburned kfs data in 2010 for a statistical comparison the 2010 burned data were compared to the 2013 unburned data and were significantly smaller table 3 in 2013 burned kfs was substantially larger than in 2010 table 3 fig 5 and significantly smaller than unburned kfs burned kfs increased substantially in 2015 but was still significantly smaller than unburned kfs fig 5 table 3 burned kfs in 2017 was the largest kfs of any year regardless of burned condition however the 2017 burned kfs were not significantly different from the 2015 unburned kfs fig 5 table 3 noting that no unburned kfs estimates were made in 2017 the use of contact sand in 2015 compared to removal of the litter duff layer in 2013 led to larger unburned kfs but the differences were not significant fig 5 burned kfs magnitude has not only returned to but exceeded unburned kfs within 5 2 to 7 1 years after the wildfire sorptivity followed similar temporal trends as kfs but tended towards more rapid recovery to unburned magnitudes in 2010 burned sorptivity was near zero table 3 fig 5 burned sorptivity in 2010 was significantly smaller than unburned sorptivity from 2013 table 3 fig 5 burned sorptivity increased markedly in 2013 and was not statistically different than unburned 2013 sorptivity fig 5 table 3 burned and unburned sorptivities were larger in 2015 compared to 2013 fig 5 table 3 and there was not a significant difference between burned and unburned sorptivity in 2015 table 3 burned sorptivity was greatest in 2017 and was significantly larger than unburned sorptivity in 2015 table 3 the sorptivity results suggest that burned sorptivity has recovered to equal or exceed unburned sorptivity within 3 years after the wildfire the comparisons of sorptivity between unburned and burned conditions and across years are complicated by the sorptivity dependence on soil water content soil conditions were relatively wet during the 2013 measurements table 3 because of the lingering elevated soil moisture following a long duration large total precipitation event in september of 2013 soil moisture was also relatively high during the 2017 measurements table 3 by contrast the 2010 and 2015 measurements were made under dry conditions table 3 the ψf depends on the square of sorptivity and is inversely dependent on kfs thus ψf tends to follow the sorptivity temporal trends the 2010 burned ψf was extremely small and significantly smaller than the 2013 unburned ψf fig 5 table 3 there was a substantial increase in burned ψ f in 2013 compared to 2010 reflecting the larger sorptivity in 2013 fig 5 there were no significant differences between burned and unburned ψ f in 2013 2015 or 2017 table 3 and neither burned nor unburned ψ f changed much between 2013 2015 and 2017 fig 5 because of the dependency on the square of sorptivity burned ψ f seemed to recover relatively quickly to unburned ψ f values similar to recovery of sorptivity values these results suggest burned ψ f recovery to effectively unburned magnitudes in 3 years since the wildfire soil water content at the time of measurement bears consideration when estimating ψ f and should follow the same soil moisture dependencies as sorptivity 3 2 remotely sensed hillslope vegetation properties the evi and lai both declined substantially after the wildfire and recovered to near pre fire levels within 5 years fig 6 the lowest evi and lai were measured immediately after the wildfire in september 2010 dashed green and black lines in fig 6 june evi green line in fig 6 and june lai black line in fig 6 track the peak vegetative indices each year and show slow recovery until the fall of 2015 5 years after the fire when both evi and lai trends level off june evi 5 years after the fire is essentially the same as the 2009 pre fire june evi however the june lai during the examined period does not return completely to the june 2009 pre fire lai fig 6 potentially because of minimal tree canopy recovery through 2017 fig 3 the within year variation in evi and lai based on the difference in values in a given year between the peak in june and when vegetation has senesced in september are smallest immediately after the wildfire and tend to increase over time fig 6 the recovery time of 5 years in evi and lai is similar to the 4 to 5 year recovery time observed for kfs but longer than recovery times for sorptivity and ψ f 3 3 relations between soil hydraulic properties and time since fire the fitted non linear logistic relations from ebel and martin 2017 followed the temporal recovery trends for soil hydraulic properties kfs sorptivity and ψ f with kfs having the slowest recovery and ψ f having the fastest recovery the fitted relation for kfs follows the trend of the burned geometric means even though the relation was fit through all the data fig 5 despite considerable scatter in the kfs data with increasing time since fire the non linear logistic relation appears to fit the central tendencies of the data reasonably well r2 0 33 table 2 aligning closely to the geometric means fig 5 the fitted sorptivity relation has worse fit quality r2 0 13 and larger standard deviations of errors of fitting on the parameter r table 2 compared to kfs the ψ f fitted relation was considerably worse than the kfs or sorptivity relation fitting with negative r2 table 2 indicating that the mean is a better predictor than the regression the standard deviation of the error in the parameter r is orders of magnitude larger than the standard deviation of the error for kfs or sorptivity table 2 suggesting a very poor fit in contrast to kfs and sorptivity there is more scatter in the ψ f data and no discernable trend after the 2010 data which likely complicates the fitting and causes a poor match relative to the geometric mean burned ψ f the fitted relation suggests a relatively rapid ψ f recovery with time since fire to asymptote in 1 year 3 4 simulated infiltration the fraction of simulated points generating runoff is greatest immediately following the fire and decreases substantially with increasing time since fire each point on a line in fig 7 for a given year represents the fraction of the simulated infiltration points i e the infiltration measurement points where the tp is less than the rainfall duration which is 15 min for i 15 and 30 min for i 30 this provides an estimate of the areal fraction of the hillslope generating infiltration excess runoff as expected within a given year the fraction of simulated points generating runoff increases with increasing recurrence interval because the associated rainfall rate is larger figs 4 and 7 in 2010 the fraction of burned points generating runoff is extremely high regardless of the rainfall recurrence interval for both i 15 and i 30 ranging from 0 9 to 1 fig 7 by 2013 the fraction of burned points generating runoff is more moderate ranging from 0 3 for a 1 year recurrence interval to 0 7 for a 1000 year recurrence interval for both i 15 and i 30 for a 0 5 fraction of ponding in 2013 the threshold recurrence interval is 30 i 15 to 200 years i 30 fig 7 in 2015 no simulated runoff is generated for burned soils until the recurrence interval is 10 years and the fraction is always 0 3 for i 15 and 50 years with the fraction always 0 2 for i 30 fig 7 by 2017 almost no simulated runoff is generated until the recurrence interval is 200 years and the fraction is always 0 1 for i 15 and similarly for i 30 until the recurrence interval is 500 years and the fraction is always 0 1 fig 7 by contrast excepting the 2010 unburned simulations because there is only one point the unburned points in 2013 and 2015 seldom generate infiltration excess runoff fig 7 until recurrence intervals exceed 20 to 50 years i 15 to 200 years i 30 even when rainfall recurrence intervals approach 1000 years the fraction of runoff generating points is always 0 25 for i 15 and 0 1 for i 30 fig 7 simulated runoff coefficients as a function of rainfall recurrence interval point to substantial declines in amounts of infiltration excess runoff with increasing time since wildfire runoff coefficients for the geometric mean soil hydraulic properties for each year point to runoff coefficients between 0 95 and 1 i 15 and 0 9 and 1 i 30 immediately after the fire for rainfall recurrence intervals from 1 to 1000 years fig 8 simulated runoff coefficients for the geometric mean soil hydraulic properties in 2013 indicate substantial reductions in amounts of infiltration excess runoff compared to 2010 but rainfall recurrence intervals 10 years can still generate appreciable surface runoff for i 15 and i 30 fig 8 in 2013 runoff coefficients of 0 4 had a threshold recurrence interval of 30 i 15 to 100 years i 30 fig 8 by 2015 and 2017 the burned geometric mean simulations generate no surface runoff regardless of the rainfall recurrence interval for both i 15 and i 30 noting that the 2015 simulations plot beneath the 2017 simulations in fig 8 the unburned runoff coefficients for the geometric mean simulations are zero for 2013 and 2015 regardless of the rainfall recurrence interval for i 15 and i 30 the 2010 unburned simulation has zero runoff coefficients for all i 30 and until the recurrence interval is 200 years for i 15 fig 8 simulated ponded infiltration rates in each year relative to the rainfall idf curves indicate that greater rainfall recurrence intervals are needed to generate surface runoff with increasing time since fire immediately after the wildfire in 2010 essentially any rain storm will generate simulated infiltration excess runoff in the geometric soil hydraulic property burned soils fig 9 by 2013 10 year rainfall recurrence intervals 30 min duration generate simulated infiltration excess runoff in burned soils geometric mean soil hydraulic properties fig 9 in 2015 only extreme rainfall events with recurrence intervals of 1000 years with durations 10 min generate simulated infiltration excess runoff in the burned soils geometric mean soil hydraulic properties fig 9 seven years after the wildfire in 2010 effectively no rain event up to 1000 year recurrence interval would generate simulated infiltration excess runoff fig 9 the unburned soils indicate zero simulated infiltration excess runoff in 2015 up to a 1000 year recurrence interval and only simulate infiltration excess runoff generation in 2013 for 1000 year recurrence interval events with durations 10 min fig 9 the 2010 unburned simulations indicate infiltration excess runoff generation for 100 year recurrence interval events with durations 10 min but this represents only one measurement and thus does not capture the full spectrum of soil hydraulic properties in unburned soils figs 5 and 9 4 discussion 4 1 temporal evolution of post wildfire infiltration and soil hydraulic properties measured infiltration and estimated soil hydraulic properties of kfs sorptivity and ψ f increased monotonically with increasing time since wildfire consistent with the window of disturbance conceptual model while some studies examining kfs recovery have shown approximately monotonic temporal trends canfield et al 2005 cerdà 1998 robichaud et al 2016 similar to this study other work has shown that seasonal variations in soil moisture drive linked fluctuations in kfs in areas where soil water repellency is a dominant factor in post wildfire infiltration e g nyman et al 2014 shakesby et al 1993a the 2 to 3 year temporal resolution of infiltration measurements in this work is not sufficient to capture seasonal variations in soil hydraulic properties but rather captures year to year changes in property magnitudes studies that tended towards monotonic kfs recovery indicated that hillslope properties such as ground cover robichaud et al 2016 and understory vegetation recovery cerdà 1998 as well as linked properties such as surface roughness canfield et al 2005 were the primary controls on infiltration recovery by contrast non monotonic kfs recovery was observed at sites where soil water repellency shakesby et al 1993a and macropore flow nyman et al 2014 were the main controls on infiltration recovery kfs was the slowest recovering property 4 5 years sorptivity had intermediate paced recovery 3 years and ψ f recovered the fastest at this field site 3 years fig 5 tables 2 and 3 comparisons with evi and lai suggest that these vegetation indices track understory vegetation at this site given the lack of tree canopy regeneration fig 3 and understory vegetation recovers approximately on the same 4 to 5 year timescale as kfs causative links cannot be demonstrated from this comparison but it suggests similarities to the mechanisms of kfs recovery at the post fire sites documented by robichaud et al 2016 and cerdà 1998 driven by understory vegetation and ground cover recovery the post wildfire kfs recovery in approximately 4 to 5 years at this field area is similar to the approximately 4 year kfs recovery measured by cerdà 1998 in mediterranean scrubland in spain however it is less than the approximately 6 year kfs recovery measured by robichaud et al 2016 in coniferous forest in montana usa and the 10 year kfs recovery estimated by runoff model calibration by canfield et al 2005 in coniferous forest and pinyon juniper woodlands in new mexico usa recovery of kfs can be substantially shorter than the time period reported here such as the 1 year recovery reported by nyman et al 2014 unfortunately there are not readily available published datasets of post wildfire sorptivity or ψ f with increasing time since fire for comparison 4 2 efficacy of a simple relation describing post wildfire recovery of soil hydraulic properties the simple relation for soil hydraulic property recovery with increasing time since fire from ebel and martin 2017 worked best for kfs moderately for sorptivity and poorly for ψ f fig 5 see r2 in table 2 trends in the soil hydraulic property relations with increasing time since fire fig 5 tend to reflect the central tendencies i e geometric means that broadly align with timescales of recovery of simulated infiltration figs 7 9 the approach from ebel and martin 2017 was originally developed using multiple kfs datasets but has not been tested for sorptivity or ψ f so it is not surprising that kfs had the best fit sorptivity and ψ f recovered more quickly than kfs and more frequent infiltration measurements in the first 3 years after wildfire appear needed to better capture the functional forms for those soil hydraulic properties looking forward it would be preferable to link hillslope properties from direct measurements or remotely sensed indices like evi or lai to functional relations describing soil hydraulic property recovery post fire hydrologic modeling would be greatly simplified by representing a spatially variable surface soil layer with an equivalent homogenous medium through the concept of an effective hydraulic conductivity that would generate approximately the same runoff response as the spatially variable reality here equation 2 was used based on prior work by ebel and martin 2017 to estimate the evolution of effective soil hydraulic properties with time since wildfire however the verdict from work in unburned e g freeze 1980 luce and cundy 1994 mirus et al 2011 and burned environments e g ebel et al 2016 langhans et al 2016a is that correctly simulating runoff using an equivalent homogenous hillslope may not produce accurate runoff predictions langhans et al 2016a demonstrated that the concept of an effective hydraulic conductivity did not hold across scales for simulating post fire runoff recent work by sheridan et al 2007 lane et al 2012 and ebel et al 2016 indicated that much of the infiltration excess runoff originated from near channel areas which suggests that a spatially uniform effective hydraulic conductivity would substantially overestimate contributing areas in burned hillslopes despite these limitations burned watersheds are seldom gauged nor is spatially variable kfs measured generalized relations that represent the central tendencies of soil hydraulic properties with increasing time since fire may facilitate runoff generation simulation in these ungauged basins knowledge of shifts in thresholds of infiltration excess runoff generation as a function of rainfall rates of different recurrence intervals estimated from simple relations such as eq 2 could provide valuable information for rapid hazard assessments to incorporate hillslope property recovery 4 3 shifts in thresholds of infiltration excess runoff generation with increasing time since fire immediately following wildfire simulated infiltration excess runoff generation was produced by most rain storms even 1 year recurrence figs 7 and 8 and the risk of associated hydrologic hazards was high hillslope observations during this period of hyper dry conditions moody and ebel 2012b showed that rainfall rates as minimal as 5 5 mm h 1 oct 12 2010 and 10 7 mm h 1 oct 22 2010 generated substantial infiltration excess runoff ebel et al 2012 hillslope runoff measurements during natural rainfall in the first summer after the fire in 2011 showed substantial surface runoff generation when rainfall rates exceeded 10 mm h 1 which is a 1 year recurrence interval storm fig 4 there were 19 of these hillslope runoff events in the summer of 2011 moody and ebel 2014 extensive hillslope erosion was also measured in summer 2011 and summer 2012 using terrestrial lidar rengers et al 2016a measured runoff at the watershed scale also showed substantial surface runoff responses to high intensity rainfall i 30 10 mm h 1 in the first two years after the fire with a maximum discharge 3 times greater than the maximum discharge before the fire 22 years of record in response to an i 30 of 42 mm h 1 5 year recurrence interval murphy et al 2018 murphy et al 2015 this is consistent with watershed observations of the period of greatest peak flows and sediment yields in the first 2 years after wildfire in the colorado front range kunze and stednick 2006 moody and martin 2001a and a similar region in new mexico bolin and ward 1987 storm runoff coefficients and sediment loads in equatorial facing australian catchments were also greatest in the first two years but remained elevated in years 3 and 4 after wildfire noske et al 2016 by the third year after wildfire soil hydraulic properties increased in magnitude fig 5 along with simulated infiltration rates fig 9 and remotely sensed vegetation cover fig 6 reducing infiltration excess runoff potential figs 7 and 8 extreme rainfall events with recurrence intervals for i 15 and i 30 in the 30 to 100 year range could still overwhelm soil infiltration rates and generate substantial infiltration excess overland flow figs 7 9 this is consistent with findings of minimal watershed runoff in this burned watershed in summer 2013 in response to typical short recurrence interval storms murphy et al 2015 it is also consistent with the substantial runoff response peak discharge of 71 m3 s 1 following an extreme rain event in september 2013 murphy et al 2018 that had a peak i 30 of 43 mm h 1 but was a much longer duration storm that in terms of total rainfall had an estimated annual exceedance probability for 24 hr rainfall of 1 1000 gochis et al 2015 measured indirect runoff based on high water marks at the hillslope scale where the burned tension infiltrometer measurements were taken suggested substantial hillslope overland flow during this september 2013 storm ebel et al 2016 moody 2016 measured unit area peak hillslope discharge was 6 8 m3 s 1 km 2 which is similar to the mean value for burned watersheds in the first two years after fire of 5 6 m3 s 1 km 2 from gartner et al 2004 this extreme 2013 storm also caused a substantial debris flow response in the burned area although many of these mobilized as shallow landslides anderson et al 2015 mcguire et al 2016 rengers et al 2016c wicherski et al 2017 suggesting a partial shift to subsurface processes including coulomb failure while prior work in the colorado front range after wildfire has suggested that peak flows recovered to near pre fire values relatively rapidly typically in 2 years post fire kunze and stednick 2006 moody and martin 2001a the 2013 extreme rain storm and the associated response at this field area shows that burned sites with substantial recovery of hillslope properties can still produce exceptional surface runoff flash floods and debris flows provided a sufficiently intense hydrologic driver of rainfall in 2015 and 2017 five to seven years after the wildfire even long recurrence interval rain storms e g 100 year storms did not generate simulated infiltration excess runoff in the burned watershed figs 7 9 this is consistent with watershed scale observations at this field area where the third highest rainfall totals in april through may 119 year record resulted in substantial stream runoff but the dominant flowpaths indicated by several concentration discharge relations were in the subsurface murphy et al 2018 five years after the 2010 wildfire substantial hillslope property recovery has shifted runoff generation back to subsurface mechanisms typical of pre fire conditions which has likely changed hazards considerations entirely to subsurface flow generated flash floods or landslides 4 4 post fire hydrologic hazard implications of shifting thresholds of runoff generation it is the timely intersection of the window of post fire impairment of hillslope properties with a rain storm of sufficient intensity and duration that ultimately produces infiltration excess runoff and associated hydrologic hazards in disturbed hillslopes fig 10 shows the evolution of hillslope properties kfs evi as a proxy for understory vegetation at this site related to infiltration excess runoff generation as these properties recover the risk of hydrologic hazards declines as represented in fig 10 by the fraction of the simulated points generating runoff across 1 1000 year recurrence intervals the risk of hydrologic hazards driven by infiltration excess surface runoff such as flash floods and debris flows can be qualitatively defined based on a combination of hillslope property recovery and representation of the runoff response as a function of the stochastic driver of rainfall fig 10 at this site an extreme rainfall event took place in september 2013 fig 10 during the window of partially recovered hillslope properties causing loss of life and substantial property damage coe et al 2014 gochis et al 2015 and highlighting the risk of such events at other field areas while the importance of the stochastic driver of rainfall for post wildfire response has been previously shown for erosion e g jones et al 2014 meira castro et al 2015 prosser and williams 1998 this approach has gained less traction in the hydrologic hazards community the work here suggests that post fire flash flood and debris flow hazard predictions with rainfall intensity duration thresholds or physically based models could benefit by including measured recovery of hillslope properties with increasing time since fire along with shifting thresholds of surface runoff generation with time to greater recurrence interval rain storms static design storms with short recurrence intervals 1 10 years may not be representative of flood and debris flow risk beyond the first couple of years after the fire as time since fire increases hazards from 100 to 1000 year storms even though remote could be considered whereas short recurrence interval storms would be omitted otherwise post fire assessments using static hillslope properties could potentially fail to predict hydrologic hazards associated with infrequent extreme rainfall events taking place in a period of partial hillslope property recovery 4 5 limitations of this work there are several limitations of this work that bear consideration before extending the findings to other regions or larger scales the infiltration simulations use dry initial conditions and neglect impacts from wetter pre storm soil moisture kampf 2011 zehe et al 2005 zehe and blöschl 2004 the use of tension infiltrometer measurements and estimates of soil hydraulic properties may exclude influences of preferential flow shown to be important in some regions post wildfire nyman et al 2010 2014 models used in this work for infiltration to estimate soil hydraulic properties philip equation and simulate runoff generation green ampt do not explicitly include processes related to soil water repellency which may impact the accuracy of kfs sorptivity ψ f and associated simulated runoff generation until such time as we have fire specific infiltration models the hydrologic community will continue to use models developed for unburned conditions with the potential limitation of missing important processes the recovery of vegetation and ground cover with increasing time since fire figs 3 and 6 which could enhance rainfall interception was not considered in the simulated infiltration the potentially important hydrologic impacts of ash bodí et al 2012 cerdà and doerr 2008 keesstra et al 2014 pereira et al 2013 were also neglected the results herein omit potentially important impacts of fire recurrence wittenberg and inbar 2009 burn severity vieira et al 2015 and post fire management practices vieira et al 2016 wagenbrenner et al 2006 because the point scale simulations neglect re infiltration of overland flow into adjacent high infiltration areas i e run on these point scale simulations are almost certainly overestimating infiltration excess runoff generation probability less so in 2010 when nearly all hillslope points generate runoff fig 7 but more prominently in 2013 when runoff is less connected fig 7 taking these limitations together the simulations here likely represent a worst case scenario for the point scale in terms of the duration of the window of disturbance of increased infiltration excess runoff generation after wildfire in the colorado front range 5 conclusions field measurements of infiltration and estimates of soil hydraulic properties kfs sorptivity ψ f in the colorado front range tended to increase monotonically with increasing time since fire consistent with the window of disturbance conceptual model a simple relation fit to the soil hydraulic property estimates described the geometric mean of temporal evolution with increasing time since fire reasonably well for kfs and sorptivity but poorly represented the temporal trends in ψ f simulated green ampt infiltration at the point scale parameterized using the soil hydraulic property estimates indicated that almost any rain storm produced infiltration excess runoff immediately after the wildfire in 2010 in 2013 three years after the fire only higher intensity and longer duration storms with low exceedance probabilities produced infiltration excess runoff by 2015 five years after the wildfire only the most extreme storms with recurrence intervals 1000 years produced substantial simulated infiltration excess runoff in 2017 seven years after the fire effectively no surface runoff was predicted for burned soils regardless of the rainfall recurrence interval up to 1000 years within 5 7 years after wildfire at this site flash flood and landslide debris flow risks have likely shifted entirely back to subsurface triggering mechanisms this work suggests that assessments of flash floods and debris flows after wildfire could fail to predict some hydrologic hazards further

5575,destructive flash floods and debris flows are a common menace following wildfire the restoration of protection provided by forests from post fire floods and debris flows depends on the recovery of infiltration and attendant reduction of infiltration excess surface runoff generation this work examines seven years of post fire infiltration measurements and temporal relations fit to soil hydraulic properties from the colorado front range usa to assess infiltration recovery with increasing time since fire point scale green ampt simulations of infiltration across a full spectrum of rainfall events are used to evaluate infiltration changes and shifts in surface runoff generation thresholds with post fire temporal recovery measured and simulated infiltration generally recovered monotonically with increasing time since fire this indicates a reduced vulnerability to infiltration excess runoff generation as time elapses with the greatest risk in the first two years after the fire the threshold for infiltration excess runoff advances with increasing time to rainfall events with higher intensity and greater return intervals by the third year after wildfire only extreme events 30 100 year recurrence generate surface runoff and by the fifth and seventh year even extreme rainfall events typically fail to generate surface runoff remotely sensed vegetation indices indicate linked or at least contemporaneous recovery of understory vegetation and field saturated hydraulic conductivity at this field site suggesting coincident recovery of multiple hillslope properties impacting surface runoff generation this work indicates the importance of coupled assessments of hillslope property recovery and stochasticity of high intensity rainfall for flash flood and debris flow hazards arising from infiltration excess runoff generation these hazards likely shift to subsurface mechanisms with increasing time since fire post fire hazard assessments using static

by degraff et al 2015 showed that 85 of post wildfire debris flows took place within the first 12 months after fire in the western u s the largest impacts for flash flood generation are also typically observed in the two years after fire e g ferreira et al 2009 moody and martin 2001a prosser and williams 1998 stoof et al 2012 this trend is consistent with the window of disturbance concept fig 1

1981 vieira et al 2016 wittenberg and inbar 2009 with responses tending to decline in magnitude with increasing time since fire hillslope properties such as infiltration rate ground cover and canopy interception tend to start off relatively high before the fire decline precipitously as a result of the fire and then recover over time fig 1 these hillslope properties recover relative to the hydrologic driver of high intensity rainfall until the hydrologic response declines substantially and the time period of greatest vulnerability has passed the window of disturbance has closed fig 1 the post wildfire hydrologic response however does not always decrease monotonically with increasing time since fire a number of post fire investigations have noted that drought or low intensity rainfall events can result in a minimal initial post wildfire runoff response florsheim et al 2017 mayor et al 2007 prats et al 2015 prior work has also shown that extreme rainfall events can cause

al 2017 often do not account for hillslope property recovery and the associated changes in runoff generation thresholds dictated by stochastic rainfall clearly the aforementioned flash flood and debris flow prediction efforts provide critical warnings of the most common hazards that are present in the first two years after wildfire however they may miss hazards associated with infrequent extreme rainfall events that strike during the post fire recovery period this points to the need for further assessments coupling hillslope property recovery and runoff response to quantitatively predict the temporal evolution of hydrologic hazards with time since wildfire that provide guidance across the full hydroclimatologic spectrum such efforts will shed light on when the window of disturbance is closed relative to elevated surface runoff generation and associated hydrologic hazards prediction of the duration of surface runoff driven hazards with increasing time since fire could be improved by including both hillslope property recovery and accounting for the stochastic nature of high intensity rainfall this work considers three questions regarding the duration of increased vulnerability of generating elevated infiltration excess runoff after wildfire 1 do hillslope soil hydraulic properties that control infiltration excess runoff generation generally increase monotonically with increasing time since fire thus reducing the propensity for surface runoff 2 can a simple relation be formulated to reasonably estimate soil hydraulic properties with increasing time since fire to enable prediction of shifts in infiltration excess runoff generation as time elapses 3 how does recovery of infiltration with increasing time after fire affect simulated runoff generation and change implications for predicting flash flood and debris flow hazards these questions are addressed through measurements of the temporal evolution from 0 to 7 years following wildfire of point scale 1 m2 infiltration that controls surface runoff generation by the infiltration excess mechanism soil hydraulic properties were estimated using infiltration theory to estimate field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs mm h 1 and sorptivity mm h 0 5 which are used to assess the efficacy of a simple relation for estimating soil hydraulic properties as a function of time since fire

both vegetation canopy and soil visual criteria from parsons et al 2010 and the remotely sensed burn severity metric called the change in the normalized burn ratio dnbr which was 834 moody et al 2016 the values for dnbr typically range from 100 unburned to 1000 high burn severity moody et al 2016 pre wildfire vegetation would have been typical of a colorado front range montane ecosystem on a north facing slope featuring aspen populus tremuloides rocky mountain douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii subspecies glauca and limber pine pinus flexilis fest 2010 soils on north facing slopes in this area tend to have thin o horizons underlain by b and c horizons and are classified as cryalfs or ustalfs birkeland et al 2003 the soil texture is classified as gravelly sand ebel 2012 the climate is classified as continental pepin 2000 with most precipitation falling as snow from late fall to spring cyclonic rainstorms in late spring and fall and convective rainstorms in summer 2 2 estimates of soil hydraulic properties soil hydraulic properties were estimated by using repeated infiltration measurements with increasing time since the 2010 wildfire measurements were collected at burned sites in 2010 2013 2015 and 2017 and at nearby unburned sites approximately 500 m away in 2010 2013 and 2015 table 1 fig 3 a e infiltration measurement locations were clustered with 3 4 measurements per cluster separated by 0 5 1 5 m and clusters separated by approximately 15 20 m clusters were located near automated soil water content sensors ebel 2013 on the hillslope specific measurement locations were constrained by avoiding logs tree stumps rocks roots and regrowing understory vegetation thus measurement locations represented opportunistic sampling that may result in bias measurements in successive years are not in exactly the same physical location to avoid local site disturbance associated with the measurement the number of measurements varied but typically was about 15 table 1 for most of the measurement snapshots in time all except 2015 soil water content was also measured using the thermogravimetric method of heating soil for 24 hrs at 105 c topp and ferré 2002 soil water content in 2015 was estimated as the mean value on the day of measurement at 5 cm depth from automated soil water content sensors decagon devices 5tm at the burned and unburned locations soil hydraulic properties of kfs and sorptivity were estimated by using a tension infiltrometer decagon devices minidisc set to 1 cm of tension in situ in the field the 1 cm of tension was selected because of the coarse textural classification of the soil that suggests a rapidly changing hydraulic conductivity function near saturation the 1 cm was the tension nearest to saturation that could be reliably reproduced using the mariotte tube apparatus in the tension infiltrometer in the field a sharpened thin walled stainless steel core 6 cm length 4 8 cm diameter was driven into the ground flush with the surface and coupled to the infiltrometer using a flexible plastic sleeve in 2010 and 2013 litter and duff were removed at the unburned measurement locations prior to measurements the tension infiltrometer was then placed directly on bare soil fig 3b at the burned and unburned locations fig 3e vegetation regrowth in 2015 fig 3c and 2017 fig 3d necessitated the use of contact sand to couple the infiltrometer base to the soil in 2015 and 2017 for the burned locations for consistency the contact sand was also used in 2015 in the unburned locations but the litter and duff were not removed prior to measurements conversion of measured infiltration rates into estimates of soil hydraulic properties requires analyzing measurements using an infiltration equation the differentiated linearization method vandervaere et al 2000a vandervaere et al 2000b was used to estimate kfs and sorptivity for 2010 2013 2015 and 2017 using the one dimensional 1d vertical infiltration approach from philip 1957 the use of the 1d approximation was facilitated by the installation of the steel core that enforces 1d vertical flow in 2010 8 out of the 12 measurements had zero infiltration i e no bubbles from the mariotte tube in 15 20 min the infiltration is not truly zero but instead a very small value that is difficult to measure using the tension infiltrometer in the field to approximate a maximum value for these 2010 burned soil measurements where zero infiltration was measured a simple estimate was made using basic assumptions first the typical bubble volumes were estimated to be 0 15 0 20 ml which was approximated using the midpoint of this range 0 175 ml this volume was then converted into a cumulative infiltration of 0 11 mm using the minidisc infiltrometer specifications the one dimensional approximation for cumulative infiltration philip 1957 vandervaere et al 2000a vandervaere et al 2000b was used only for the 2010 burned estimates where infiltration was zero to estimate kfs and sorptivity assuming that infiltration was partitioned 10 into the sorptivity and 90 into the kfs terms the 10 partitioning of infiltration into sorptivity was conceptualized to represent the minimal influence of sorptivity in infiltration immediately after wildfire ebel and moody 2017 moody et al 2009 nyman et al 2010 the maximum sorptivity during the 2010 burned measurements where zero infiltration was recorded is 0 02 mm h 0 5 and the maximum kfs is 0 7 mm h 1 for all measurements kfs was estimated assuming that the β parameter was 0 6 haverkamp et al 1994 note that only measurements for which kfs and sorptivity are both positive were used in this work which is why there may be a difference between the number of measurements in table 1 and the number of kfs and sorptivity values in a given year sorptivity can be estimated to be negative in the differentiated linearization method because it is the intercept in a linearized equation such that when sorptivity is near zero the intercept can be slightly negative only two estimates had negative sorptivity values and both were in the unburned area one in 2010 and one in 2015 table 1 a negative kfs is most often the result of a layered near surface system where kfs decreases in the lower layer only one estimate had a negative kfs which was located in the burned area in 2015 table 1 negative sorptivity or kfs values affected only 3 out of 85 measurements 4 infiltration processes can become complicated after wildfire by issues such as soil water repellency resulting in non standard temporal patterns of infiltration e g chen et al 2020 imeson et al 1992 while the philip equation approach used here does not explicitly include these processes it is used here to estimate soil hydraulic properties in the context of an effective parameter the kfs and sorptivity estimates were used to estimate the green ampt wetting front potential ψf mm to facilitate simulating the infiltration response to specific rainfall rates and durations the ψf was estimated using the equation ebel and moody 2017 1 ψ f s 2 2 k fs θ s where s is sorptivity θs is the saturated soil water content equation 1 assumes that the initial soil water content θi is very small relative to θs such that the difference between θs and θi can be approximated as simply θs and that the initial hydraulic conductivity ki is much smaller than kfs such the difference between kfs and ki can be approximated as kfs in this work it was assumed that the estimated soil hydraulic properties are isotropic the term field saturated with regards to hydraulic conductivity is intended to distinguish between the vacuum saturated conditions established in laboratory measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks mm h 1 and the conditions typical in field measurements or laboratory measurements in near saturated conditions where small amounts of entrapped air are present in the soil reynolds et al 1983 prior work has shown a factor of two difference between ks and kfs bouwer 1966 stephens et al 1984 stephens et al 1983 with ks being greater and some investigators have opined that kfs better represents hydraulic conductivity during infiltration in field conditions the field saturated term also denotes that water repellency impacts are included in the non ponded k estimate langhans et al 2016a nyman et al 2010 philip 1969 has noted that sorptivity should be expressed relative to a defined change in pressure head ψ or θ between an initial and final condition reflecting the initial soil water status and the boundary conditions the initial and final ψ or θ were not measured at every location thus sorptivity measurements reported here can only be referenced relative to the average θ measurements taken at the field sites that approximate the initial condition the potential differences in initial and final ψ and θ should be considered when interpreting differences in sorptivity estimates for different years at this field area and also when comparing to estimates from other field sites geometric means are used to represent the central tendencies of the soil hydraulic properties in this work for data that are approximately log normally distributed like ks freeze and cherry 1979 talsma and hallam 1980 and some unsaturated soil hydraulic properties kosugi 1996 in unburned environments the geometric mean is more representative as a central tendency than the arithmetic mean while some research has shown that ks is not log normally distributed after wildfire langhans et al 2016a it can be nearly log normally distributed ebel 2019 and the geometric mean has been used as a representative ks value in post wildfire hydrologic modeling ebel et al 2016 2 3 simple relation for estimating soil hydraulic properties with time since fire the window of disturbance concept puts forth the idea that post fire hydrologic and geomorphic response declines with increasing time since fire after a period of greatest impacts immediately after fire fig 1 in a meta analysis of kfs recovery as a function of time ebel and martin 2017 introduced an expression to represent kfs with time since fire that is broadly consistent with the window of disturbance model the non linear logistic relation proposed by ebel and martin 2017 was designed to represent variables with an initial exponential growth that asymptote to a stable value 2 k fs t k ub k bto e rt k ub k bto e rt 1 where t is time since fire years kbto mm h 1 is the minimum kfs value assumed to be at the time immediately after the fire to kub mm h 1 is the unburned kfs that is presumed to provide an asymptotic upper limit and r is a parameter governing the rate of recovery year 1 important assumptions embedded in equation 2 include that i fire effects do not increase kfs such that after a long time of recovery that kfs t does not exceed kub ii the term unburned is actually denoting a long unburned condition shakesby et al 1993b iii the minimum kfs is present immediately after fire at to iv an ash layer that could be present at the surface is not explicitly represented v it is presumed that an effective kfs including matrix and macropore influences as well as water repellency effects can be determined and is representative across scales and vi kfs can recover to kub within a finite time frame after fire rather than being permanently degraded these are not trivial assumptions but provide an initial method for framing how central tendencies such as the geometric mean of soil hydraulic property recovery could be quantified with time since fire in this work the efficacy of eq 2 for representing measured kfs sorptivity and ψf with increasing time since fire was evaluated fitting for sorptivity or ψf also used eq 2 replacing hydraulic conductivity terms with sorptivity or ψf values the r parameters in eq 2 were fitted to all the burned data not the mean or geometric mean using the curve fit function in the scipy optimize package release 1 3 0 in python 3 7 1 kbto was set to the geometric mean in 2010 immediately after the wildfire table 2 kub was set to the unburned geometric mean from the 2015 data table 2 2 4 infiltration modeling infiltration modeling using estimates of soil hydraulic properties provides a context to consider how rainfall of differing rates durations and associated recurrence intervals promotes infiltration excess runoff generation with increasing time since fire as hillslope properties recover infiltration into mineral soil was simulated by using the green ampt approach green and ampt 1911 based upon the constant rainfall rate implementation by mein and larson 1973 the green ampt approach has been widely used to simulate post wildfire infiltration and runoff generation e g rengers et al 2016b van eck et al 2016 woods and balfour 2008 yates et al 2001 the soil hydraulic properties kfs and ψf from each infiltration measurement were used to parameterize a green ampt simulation for that point across the spectrum of rainfall rates for different recurrence intervals assuming that initial conditions prior to rainfall are relatively dry causing the initial hydraulic conductivity ki mm h 1 at the initial soil water content θi cm3 cm 3 to be very small and negligible relative to ks mm h 1 the time to ponding tp h can be approximated 3 t p i p r ψ f k s θ s θ i r r k s where ip is the cumulative infiltration at ponding mm r is the rainfall rate mm h 1 ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and θs cm3 cm 3 is the saturated soil water content the ip at tp can be estimated as 4 i p ψ f k s θ s θ i r k s when cumulative infiltration i mm is ip the time t for a given i t is 5 t i r and when i t ip t is 6 t t p 1 k s i i p ψ f θ s θ i l n ψ f θ s θ i i p ψ f θ s θ i i the infiltration rate as a function of time i t when t tp is r and when t tp is 7 i t k s 1 ψ f θ s θ i i equation 3 was used to estimate tp across a spectrum of rainfall recurrence intervals to analyze the shifts with increasing time since fire two characteristic rainfall durations were focused on which are the 15 minute i 15 and 30 minute i 30 rainfall rates that have been shown to be related to post fire debris flow kean et al 2011 staley et al 2017 and flash flood moody and martin 2001b generation respectively equation 7 was then used along with eqs 3 6 to examine runoff coefficients across rainfall recurrence intervals for i 15 and i 30 and also consider ponded infiltration rates across rain storms of different exceedance probabilities with the associated rainfall rates and durations for a given exceedance probability to examine the infiltration excess runoff generation likelihood at this specific field area the initial condition θi was set to 0 02 for all years which was the average immediate post fire soil water content ebel et al 2012 and θs was set to 0 46 for the unburned soil and 0 49 for the burned soil based on saturated soil water contents measured to construct soil water retention curves at the same locations as the tension infiltrometer measurements ebel 2012 using the same θi across all years provides a consistent basis for comparison of simulations with increasing time since fire to isolate the soil infiltration response into mineral soil no canopy or litter duff interception was included for either the unburned or burned simulations depression storage was assumed to be zero for these point scale simulations and routing was not considered the green ampt approach as implemented here assumes that the soil is homogeneous and isotropic with respect to soil properties a sharp wetting front is present matric potential at the wetting front remains constant as the front progresses downward rainfall rate is constant with time uniform θi and that θ is uniform behind the wetting front mein and larson 1973 tindall and kunkel 1999 the green ampt assumptions may be problematic in burned soils where wetting fronts may be unstable e g stoof et al 2014 in this work the green ampt model provides an approximation of infiltration and runoff generation to compare runoff generation with increasing time since fire the interface between the soil and weathered bedrock is not represented in the infiltration modeling flow of the air phase during infiltration morel seytoux and khanji 1974 is neglected here the assumptions regarding the k as a function of saturation are the primary difference between the green ampt approach and other infiltration approaches parlange et al 1982 smith and parlange 1978 commonly used in post wildfire hydrologic modeling smith et al 2002 green ampt assumes a delta function diffusivity meaning that the changes in k are constant near saturation whereas the smith and parlange 1978 approach uses an exponentially decreasing k as saturation decreases and the parlange et al 1982 approach has a flexible functional form all three of these infiltration models include effects of gravity and capillarity as the driving forces of infiltration with the partitioning and efficacy determined by the model parameters representative rainfall rates at difference recurrence intervals of 1 10 100 and 1000 years fig 4 a and b for this area were selected from the noaa atlas 14 web interface perica et al 2015 https hdsc nws noaa gov hdsc pfds pfds map cont html bkmrk ne the precipitation rate frequency estimates are derived from frequency analysis of partial duration series the minimum rainfall duration analyzed by perica et al 2015 was 5 min and the maximum duration was 60 days 2 5 remotely sensed hillslope properties for vegetation and ground cover recovery infiltration recovery after wildfire is linked in some areas to understory vegetation recovery and reestablishment of ground cover the combination of understory vegetation and litter cover is subsumed into the term ground cover in some studies e g robichaud 2005 because understory vegetation and ground cover were not quantified in the field at this site trends are instead estimated using remotely sensed metrics the two metrics used here are the leaf area index lai and enhanced vegetation index evi from the nasa moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products https terra nasa gov about terra instruments modis the modis lai is defined for broadleaf canopies as the one sided green leaf area per unit ground area and for coniferous canopies as half the total needle surface area per unit ground area resulting in units of m2 m 2 myneni et al 2015 the modis evi is derived from atmospherically corrected reflectance in the red near infrared and blue wavebands which minimizes canopy soil variations and improves sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions didan et al 2015 these indices are provided at 500 m resolution which may include areas of lower burn severity near the burned area modis vegetation indices have been used in prior studies to assess vegetation recovery in burned areas bright et al 2019 jin et al 2012 moreno et al 2019 june is the period of peak evi and lai in this area and only june through september data were used to avoid snow cover issues 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis facilitates evaluating differences between burned and unburned soil hydraulic properties within the same year and between years the kruskal wallis test was used to assess population differences for equality of medians kruskal and wallis 1952 a threshold p value of 0 05 was used to reject the null hypothesis of equivalent medians the scipy stats package release 1 3 0 in python 3 7 1 was used for all statistical analysis 3 results 3 1 estimated soil hydraulic properties the soil hydraulic property of kfs was smallest in 2010 immediately following the wildfire and increased with progressively longer time after the fire burned kfs was extremely small in 2010 table 3 fig 5 reflecting the 8 out of 12 measurements that had zero infiltration during measurement the sole unburned kfs estimate in 2010 was orders of magnitude larger 169 mm h 1 table 3 fig 5 because there were insufficient unburned kfs data in 2010 for a statistical comparison the 2010 burned data were compared to the 2013 unburned data and were significantly smaller table 3 in 2013 burned kfs was substantially larger than in 2010 table 3 fig 5 and significantly smaller than unburned kfs burned kfs increased substantially in 2015 but was still significantly smaller than unburned kfs fig 5 table 3 burned kfs in 2017 was the largest kfs of any year regardless of burned condition however the 2017 burned kfs were not significantly different from the 2015 unburned kfs fig 5 table 3 noting that no unburned kfs estimates were made in 2017 the use of contact sand in 2015 compared to removal of the litter duff layer in 2013 led to larger unburned kfs but the differences were not significant fig 5 burned kfs magnitude has not only returned to but exceeded unburned kfs within 5 2 to 7 1 years after the wildfire sorptivity followed similar temporal trends as kfs but tended towards more rapid recovery to unburned magnitudes in 2010 burned sorptivity was near zero table 3 fig 5 burned sorptivity in 2010 was significantly smaller than unburned sorptivity from 2013 table 3 fig 5 burned sorptivity increased markedly in 2013 and was not statistically different than unburned 2013 sorptivity fig 5 table 3 burned and unburned sorptivities were larger in 2015 compared to 2013 fig 5 table 3 and there was not a significant difference between burned and unburned sorptivity in 2015 table 3 burned sorptivity was greatest in 2017 and was significantly larger than unburned sorptivity in 2015 table 3 the sorptivity results suggest that burned sorptivity has recovered to equal or exceed unburned sorptivity within 3 years after the wildfire the comparisons of sorptivity between unburned and burned conditions and across years are complicated by the sorptivity dependence on soil water content soil conditions were relatively wet during the 2013 measurements table 3 because of the lingering elevated soil moisture following a long duration large total precipitation event in september of 2013 soil moisture was also relatively high during the 2017 measurements table 3 by contrast the 2010 and 2015 measurements were made under dry conditions table 3 the ψf depends on the square of sorptivity and is inversely dependent on kfs thus ψf tends to follow the sorptivity temporal trends the 2010 burned ψf was extremely small and significantly smaller than the 2013 unburned ψf fig 5 table 3 there was a substantial increase in burned ψ f in 2013 compared to 2010 reflecting the larger sorptivity in 2013 fig 5 there were no significant differences between burned and unburned ψ f in 2013 2015 or 2017 table 3 and neither burned nor unburned ψ f changed much between 2013 2015 and 2017 fig 5 because of the dependency on the square of sorptivity burned ψ f seemed to recover relatively quickly to unburned ψ f values similar to recovery of sorptivity values these results suggest burned ψ f recovery to effectively unburned magnitudes in 3 years since the wildfire soil water content at the time of measurement bears consideration when estimating ψ f and should follow the same soil moisture dependencies as sorptivity 3 2 remotely sensed hillslope vegetation properties the evi and lai both declined substantially after the wildfire and recovered to near pre fire levels within 5 years fig 6 the lowest evi and lai were measured immediately after the wildfire in september 2010 dashed green and black lines in fig 6 june evi green line in fig 6 and june lai black line in fig 6 track the peak vegetative indices each year and show slow recovery until the fall of 2015 5 years after the fire when both evi and lai trends level off june evi 5 years after the fire is essentially the same as the 2009 pre fire june evi however the june lai during the examined period does not return completely to the june 2009 pre fire lai fig 6 potentially because of minimal tree canopy recovery through 2017 fig 3 the within year variation in evi and lai based on the difference in values in a given year between the peak in june and when vegetation has senesced in september are smallest immediately after the wildfire and tend to increase over time fig 6 the recovery time of 5 years in evi and lai is similar to the 4 to 5 year recovery time observed for kfs but longer than recovery times for sorptivity and ψ f 3 3 relations between soil hydraulic properties and time since fire the fitted non linear logistic relations from ebel and martin 2017 followed the temporal recovery trends for soil hydraulic properties kfs sorptivity and ψ f with kfs having the slowest recovery and ψ f having the fastest recovery the fitted relation for kfs follows the trend of the burned geometric means even though the relation was fit through all the data fig 5 despite considerable scatter in the kfs data with increasing time since fire the non linear logistic relation appears to fit the central tendencies of the data reasonably well r2 0 33 table 2 aligning closely to the geometric means fig 5 the fitted sorptivity relation has worse fit quality r2 0 13 and larger standard deviations of errors of fitting on the parameter r table 2 compared to kfs the ψ f fitted relation was considerably worse than the kfs or sorptivity relation fitting with negative r2 table 2 indicating that the mean is a better predictor than the regression the standard deviation of the error in the parameter r is orders of magnitude larger than the standard deviation of the error for kfs or sorptivity table 2 suggesting a very poor fit in contrast to kfs and sorptivity there is more scatter in the ψ f data and no discernable trend after the 2010 data which likely complicates the fitting and causes a poor match relative to the geometric mean burned ψ f the fitted relation suggests a relatively rapid ψ f recovery with time since fire to asymptote in 1 year 3 4 simulated infiltration the fraction of simulated points generating runoff is greatest immediately following the fire and decreases substantially with increasing time since fire each point on a line in fig 7 for a given year represents the fraction of the simulated infiltration points i e the infiltration measurement points where the tp is less than the rainfall duration which is 15 min for i 15 and 30 min for i 30 this provides an estimate of the areal fraction of the hillslope generating infiltration excess runoff as expected within a given year the fraction of simulated points generating runoff increases with increasing recurrence interval because the associated rainfall rate is larger figs 4 and 7 in 2010 the fraction of burned points generating runoff is extremely high regardless of the rainfall recurrence interval for both i 15 and i 30 ranging from 0 9 to 1 fig 7 by 2013 the fraction of burned points generating runoff is more moderate ranging from 0 3 for a 1 year recurrence interval to 0 7 for a 1000 year recurrence interval for both i 15 and i 30 for a 0 5 fraction of ponding in 2013 the threshold recurrence interval is 30 i 15 to 200 years i 30 fig 7 in 2015 no simulated runoff is generated for burned soils until the recurrence interval is 10 years and the fraction is always 0 3 for i 15 and 50 years with the fraction always 0 2 for i 30 fig 7 by 2017 almost no simulated runoff is generated until the recurrence interval is 200 years and the fraction is always 0 1 for i 15 and similarly for i 30 until the recurrence interval is 500 years and the fraction is always 0 1 fig 7 by contrast excepting the 2010 unburned simulations because there is only one point the unburned points in 2013 and 2015 seldom generate infiltration excess runoff fig 7 until recurrence intervals exceed 20 to 50 years i 15 to 200 years i 30 even when rainfall recurrence intervals approach 1000 years the fraction of runoff generating points is always 0 25 for i 15 and 0 1 for i 30 fig 7 simulated runoff coefficients as a function of rainfall recurrence interval point to substantial declines in amounts of infiltration excess runoff with increasing time since wildfire runoff coefficients for the geometric mean soil hydraulic properties for each year point to runoff coefficients between 0 95 and 1 i 15 and 0 9 and 1 i 30 immediately after the fire for rainfall recurrence intervals from 1 to 1000 years fig 8 simulated runoff coefficients for the geometric mean soil hydraulic properties in 2013 indicate substantial reductions in amounts of infiltration excess runoff compared to 2010 but rainfall recurrence intervals 10 years can still generate appreciable surface runoff for i 15 and i 30 fig 8 in 2013 runoff coefficients of 0 4 had a threshold recurrence interval of 30 i 15 to 100 years i 30 fig 8 by 2015 and 2017 the burned geometric mean simulations generate no surface runoff regardless of the rainfall recurrence interval for both i 15 and i 30 noting that the 2015 simulations plot beneath the 2017 simulations in fig 8 the unburned runoff coefficients for the geometric mean simulations are zero for 2013 and 2015 regardless of the rainfall recurrence interval for i 15 and i 30 the 2010 unburned simulation has zero runoff coefficients for all i 30 and until the recurrence interval is 200 years for i 15 fig 8 simulated ponded infiltration rates in each year relative to the rainfall idf curves indicate that greater rainfall recurrence intervals are needed to generate surface runoff with increasing time since fire immediately after the wildfire in 2010 essentially any rain storm will generate simulated infiltration excess runoff in the geometric soil hydraulic property burned soils fig 9 by 2013 10 year rainfall recurrence intervals 30 min duration generate simulated infiltration excess runoff in burned soils geometric mean soil hydraulic properties fig 9 in 2015 only extreme rainfall events with recurrence intervals of 1000 years with durations 10 min generate simulated infiltration excess runoff in the burned soils geometric mean soil hydraulic properties fig 9 seven years after the wildfire in 2010 effectively no rain event up to 1000 year recurrence interval would generate simulated infiltration excess runoff fig 9 the unburned soils indicate zero simulated infiltration excess runoff in 2015 up to a 1000 year recurrence interval and only simulate infiltration excess runoff generation in 2013 for 1000 year recurrence interval events with durations 10 min fig 9 the 2010 unburned simulations indicate infiltration excess runoff generation for 100 year recurrence interval events with durations 10 min but this represents only one measurement and thus does not capture the full spectrum of soil hydraulic properties in unburned soils figs 5 and 9 4 discussion 4 1 temporal evolution of post wildfire infiltration and soil hydraulic properties measured infiltration and estimated soil hydraulic properties of kfs sorptivity and ψ f increased monotonically with increasing time since wildfire consistent with the window of disturbance conceptual model while some studies examining kfs recovery have shown approximately monotonic temporal trends canfield et al 2005 cerdà 1998 robichaud et al 2016 similar to this study other work has shown that seasonal variations in soil moisture drive linked fluctuations in kfs in areas where soil water repellency is a dominant factor in post wildfire infiltration e g nyman et al 2014 shakesby et al 1993a the 2 to 3 year temporal resolution of infiltration measurements in this work is not sufficient to capture seasonal variations in soil hydraulic properties but rather captures year to year changes in property magnitudes studies that tended towards monotonic kfs recovery indicated that hillslope properties such as ground cover robichaud et al 2016 and understory vegetation recovery cerdà 1998 as well as linked properties such as surface roughness canfield et al 2005 were the primary controls on infiltration recovery by contrast non monotonic kfs recovery was observed at sites where soil water repellency shakesby et al 1993a and macropore flow nyman et al 2014 were the main controls on infiltration recovery kfs was the slowest recovering property 4 5 years sorptivity had intermediate paced recovery 3 years and ψ f recovered the fastest at this field site 3 years fig 5 tables 2 and 3 comparisons with evi and lai suggest that these vegetation indices track understory vegetation at this site given the lack of tree canopy regeneration fig 3 and understory vegetation recovers approximately on the same 4 to 5 year timescale as kfs causative links cannot be demonstrated from this comparison but it suggests similarities to the mechanisms of kfs recovery at the post fire sites documented by robichaud et al 2016 and cerdà 1998 driven by understory vegetation and ground cover recovery the post wildfire kfs recovery in approximately 4 to 5 years at this field area is similar to the approximately 4 year kfs recovery measured by cerdà 1998 in mediterranean scrubland in spain however it is less than the approximately 6 year kfs recovery measured by robichaud et al 2016 in coniferous forest in montana usa and the 10 year kfs recovery estimated by runoff model calibration by canfield et al 2005 in coniferous forest and pinyon juniper woodlands in new mexico usa recovery of kfs can be substantially shorter than the time period reported here such as the 1 year recovery reported by nyman et al 2014 unfortunately there are not readily available published datasets of post wildfire sorptivity or ψ f with increasing time since fire for comparison 4 2 efficacy of a simple relation describing post wildfire recovery of soil hydraulic properties the simple relation for soil hydraulic property recovery with increasing time since fire from ebel and martin 2017 worked best for kfs moderately for sorptivity and poorly for ψ f fig 5 see r2 in table 2 trends in the soil hydraulic property relations with increasing time since fire fig 5 tend to reflect the central tendencies i e geometric means that broadly align with timescales of recovery of simulated infiltration figs 7 9 the approach from ebel and martin 2017 was originally developed using multiple kfs datasets but has not been tested for sorptivity or ψ f so it is not surprising that kfs had the best fit sorptivity and ψ f recovered more quickly than kfs and more frequent infiltration measurements in the first 3 years after wildfire appear needed to better capture the functional forms for those soil hydraulic properties looking forward it would be preferable to link hillslope properties from direct measurements or remotely sensed indices like evi or lai to functional relations describing soil hydraulic property recovery post fire hydrologic modeling would be greatly simplified by representing a spatially variable surface soil layer with an equivalent homogenous medium through the concept of an effective hydraulic conductivity that would generate approximately the same runoff response as the spatially variable reality here equation 2 was used based on prior work by ebel and martin 2017 to estimate the evolution of effective soil hydraulic properties with time since wildfire however the verdict from work in unburned e g freeze 1980 luce and cundy 1994 mirus et al 2011 and burned environments e g ebel et al 2016 langhans et al 2016a is that correctly simulating runoff using an equivalent homogenous hillslope may not produce accurate runoff predictions langhans et al 2016a demonstrated that the concept of an effective hydraulic conductivity did not hold across scales for simulating post fire runoff recent work by sheridan et al 2007 lane et al 2012 and ebel et al 2016 indicated that much of the infiltration excess runoff originated from near channel areas which suggests that a spatially uniform effective hydraulic conductivity would substantially overestimate contributing areas in burned hillslopes despite these limitations burned watersheds are seldom gauged nor is spatially variable kfs measured generalized relations that represent the central tendencies of soil hydraulic properties with increasing time since fire may facilitate runoff generation simulation in these ungauged basins knowledge of shifts in thresholds of infiltration excess runoff generation as a function of rainfall rates of different recurrence intervals estimated from simple relations such as eq 2 could provide valuable information for rapid hazard assessments to incorporate hillslope property recovery 4 3 shifts in thresholds of infiltration excess runoff generation with increasing time since fire immediately following wildfire simulated infiltration excess runoff generation was produced by most rain storms even 1 year recurrence figs 7 and 8 and the risk of associated hydrologic hazards was high hillslope observations during this period of hyper dry conditions moody and ebel 2012b showed that rainfall rates as minimal as 5 5 mm h 1 oct 12 2010 and 10 7 mm h 1 oct 22 2010 generated substantial infiltration excess runoff ebel et al 2012 hillslope runoff measurements during natural rainfall in the first summer after the fire in 2011 showed substantial surface runoff generation when rainfall rates exceeded 10 mm h 1 which is a 1 year recurrence interval storm fig 4 there were 19 of these hillslope runoff events in the summer of 2011 moody and ebel 2014 extensive hillslope erosion was also measured in summer 2011 and summer 2012 using terrestrial lidar rengers et al 2016a measured runoff at the watershed scale also showed substantial surface runoff responses to high intensity rainfall i 30 10 mm h 1 in the first two years after the fire with a maximum discharge 3 times greater than the maximum discharge before the fire 22 years of record in response to an i 30 of 42 mm h 1 5 year recurrence interval murphy et al 2018 murphy et al 2015 this is consistent with watershed observations of the period of greatest peak flows and sediment yields in the first 2 years after wildfire in the colorado front range kunze and stednick 2006 moody and martin 2001a and a similar region in new mexico bolin and ward 1987 storm runoff coefficients and sediment loads in equatorial facing australian catchments were also greatest in the first two years but remained elevated in years 3 and 4 after wildfire noske et al 2016 by the third year after wildfire soil hydraulic properties increased in magnitude fig 5 along with simulated infiltration rates fig 9 and remotely sensed vegetation cover fig 6 reducing infiltration excess runoff potential figs 7 and 8 extreme rainfall events with recurrence intervals for i 15 and i 30 in the 30 to 100 year range could still overwhelm soil infiltration rates and generate substantial infiltration excess overland flow figs 7 9 this is consistent with findings of minimal watershed runoff in this burned watershed in summer 2013 in response to typical short recurrence interval storms murphy et al 2015 it is also consistent with the substantial runoff response peak discharge of 71 m3 s 1 following an extreme rain event in september 2013 murphy et al 2018 that had a peak i 30 of 43 mm h 1 but was a much longer duration storm that in terms of total rainfall had an estimated annual exceedance probability for 24 hr rainfall of 1 1000 gochis et al 2015 measured indirect runoff based on high water marks at the hillslope scale where the burned tension infiltrometer measurements were taken suggested substantial hillslope overland flow during this september 2013 storm ebel et al 2016 moody 2016 measured unit area peak hillslope discharge was 6 8 m3 s 1 km 2 which is similar to the mean value for burned watersheds in the first two years after fire of 5 6 m3 s 1 km 2 from gartner et al 2004 this extreme 2013 storm also caused a substantial debris flow response in the burned area although many of these mobilized as shallow landslides anderson et al 2015 mcguire et al 2016 rengers et al 2016c wicherski et al 2017 suggesting a partial shift to subsurface processes including coulomb failure while prior work in the colorado front range after wildfire has suggested that peak flows recovered to near pre fire values relatively rapidly typically in 2 years post fire kunze and stednick 2006 moody and martin 2001a the 2013 extreme rain storm and the associated response at this field area shows that burned sites with substantial recovery of hillslope properties can still produce exceptional surface runoff flash floods and debris flows provided a sufficiently intense hydrologic driver of rainfall in 2015 and 2017 five to seven years after the wildfire even long recurrence interval rain storms e g 100 year storms did not generate simulated infiltration excess runoff in the burned watershed figs 7 9 this is consistent with watershed scale observations at this field area where the third highest rainfall totals in april through may 119 year record resulted in substantial stream runoff but the dominant flowpaths indicated by several concentration discharge relations were in the subsurface murphy et al 2018 five years after the 2010 wildfire substantial hillslope property recovery has shifted runoff generation back to subsurface mechanisms typical of pre fire conditions which has likely changed hazards considerations entirely to subsurface flow generated flash floods or landslides 4 4 post fire hydrologic hazard implications of shifting thresholds of runoff generation it is the timely intersection of the window of post fire impairment of hillslope properties with a rain storm of sufficient intensity and duration that ultimately produces infiltration excess runoff and associated hydrologic hazards in disturbed hillslopes fig 10 shows the evolution of hillslope properties kfs evi as a proxy for understory vegetation at this site related to infiltration excess runoff generation as these properties recover the risk of hydrologic hazards declines as represented in fig 10 by the fraction of the simulated points generating runoff across 1 1000 year recurrence intervals the risk of hydrologic hazards driven by infiltration excess surface runoff such as flash floods and debris flows can be qualitatively defined based on a combination of hillslope property recovery and representation of the runoff response as a function of the stochastic driver of rainfall fig 10 at this site an extreme rainfall event took place in september 2013 fig 10 during the window of partially recovered hillslope properties causing loss of life and substantial property damage coe et al 2014 gochis et al 2015 and highlighting the risk of such events at other field areas while the importance of the stochastic driver of rainfall for post wildfire response has been previously shown for erosion e g jones et al 2014 meira castro et al 2015 prosser and williams 1998 this approach has gained less traction in the hydrologic hazards community the work here suggests that post fire flash flood and debris flow hazard predictions with rainfall intensity duration thresholds or physically based models could benefit by including measured recovery of hillslope properties with increasing time since fire along with shifting thresholds of surface runoff generation with time to greater recurrence interval rain storms static design storms with short recurrence intervals 1 10 years may not be representative of flood and debris flow risk beyond the first couple of years after the fire as time since fire increases hazards from 100 to 1000 year storms even though remote could be considered whereas short recurrence interval storms would be omitted otherwise post fire assessments using static hillslope properties could potentially fail to predict hydrologic hazards associated with infrequent extreme rainfall events taking place in a period of partial hillslope property recovery 4 5 limitations of this work there are several limitations of this work that bear consideration before extending the findings to other regions or larger scales the infiltration simulations use dry initial conditions and neglect impacts from wetter pre storm soil moisture kampf 2011 zehe et al 2005 zehe and blöschl 2004 the use of tension infiltrometer measurements and estimates of soil hydraulic properties may exclude influences of preferential flow shown to be important in some regions post wildfire nyman et al 2010 2014 models used in this work for infiltration to estimate soil hydraulic properties philip equation and simulate runoff generation green ampt do not explicitly include processes related to soil water repellency which may impact the accuracy of kfs sorptivity ψ f and associated simulated runoff generation until such time as we have fire specific infiltration models the hydrologic community will continue to use models developed for unburned conditions with the potential limitation of missing important processes the recovery of vegetation and ground cover with increasing time since fire figs 3 and 6 which could enhance rainfall interception was not considered in the simulated infiltration the potentially important hydrologic impacts of ash bodí et al 2012 cerdà and doerr 2008 keesstra et al 2014 pereira et al 2013 were also neglected the results herein omit potentially important impacts of fire recurrence wittenberg and inbar 2009 burn severity vieira et al 2015 and post fire management practices vieira et al 2016 wagenbrenner et al 2006 because the point scale simulations neglect re infiltration of overland flow into adjacent high infiltration areas i e run on these point scale simulations are almost certainly overestimating infiltration excess runoff generation probability less so in 2010 when nearly all hillslope points generate runoff fig 7 but more prominently in 2013 when runoff is less connected fig 7 taking these limitations together the simulations here likely represent a worst case scenario for the point scale in terms of the duration of the window of disturbance of increased infiltration excess runoff generation after wildfire in the colorado front range 5 conclusions field measurements of infiltration and estimates of soil hydraulic properties kfs sorptivity ψ f in the colorado front range tended to increase monotonically with increasing time since fire consistent with the window of disturbance conceptual model a simple relation fit to the soil hydraulic property estimates described the geometric mean of temporal evolution with increasing time since fire reasonably well for kfs and sorptivity but poorly represented the temporal trends in ψ f simulated green ampt infiltration at the point scale parameterized using the soil hydraulic property estimates indicated that almost any rain storm produced infiltration excess runoff immediately after the wildfire in 2010 in 2013 three years after the fire only higher intensity and longer duration storms with low exceedance probabilities produced infiltration excess runoff by 2015 five years after the wildfire only the most extreme storms with recurrence intervals 1000 years produced substantial simulated infiltration excess runoff in 2017 seven years after the fire effectively no surface runoff was predicted for burned soils regardless of the rainfall recurrence interval up to 1000 years within 5 7 years after wildfire at this site flash flood and landslide debris flow risks have likely shifted entirely back to subsurface triggering mechanisms this work suggests that assessments of flash floods and debris flows after wildfire could fail to predict some hydrologic hazards further

5576,hydraulic characteristics are important fundamental properties of fractured rock masses and involve various geoscience and engineering disciplines the determination of the permeability tensor is the basic input of the equivalent continuum ec model for hydraulic behavior analysis an analytical method to determine the permeability tensor of fractured rock masses is developed based on the orientation and linear frequency of fractures along with a value of the permeability in any direction the orientation and linear frequency of fractures can be easily sampled in practice and the value of the permeability in some direction can be tested by a relatively cheap single well pumping test the key step of this method is to derive the theoretical relationship between the permeabilities in two different directions in addition an anisotropy index of permeability aip is defined to quantitatively describe the permeability anisotropy some numerical experiments were conducted with the universal distinct element code udec to validate the developed method the results show that a the predicted values are very close to the real ones b for all cases of rock masses with equal aperture fracture sets the mean error rate of the permeabilities in 23 different directions is approximately 10 c for rock masses with different aperture fracture sets the mean error rate increases from 8 6 to 28 9 as the aperture ratio increases from 1 to 4 and d therefore the estimation method for directional permeability proposed in this study is valid especially for those rock masses in which the aperture ratios of the fracture sets are small e g less than 3 keywords discrete fracture network dfn permeability tensor directional permeability fractured rock masses equivalent continuum model hydraulic behavior 1 introduction the hydraulic responses of fractured rock masses to pressure gradients are the focus of various geoscience and engineering disciplines lang et al 2014 such as hydrogeology engineering geology hydropower engineering mining engineering petroleum engineering underground engineering geothermal engineering and environmental engineering with respect to fractured tight rock masses such as granite and basalt the hydraulic behaviors are primarily governed by the existing fractures liu et al 2019a b rong et al 2013 not the rock matrix hence such rock masses usually exhibit significant anisotropy it should be noted that in this paper the term fracture is a general expression for separations in rock masses zhang 2005a b mainly including all cracks fissures schistosity planes joints bedding planes and faults isrm 1978 mathematical model methods are believed to be effective means to investigate the hydraulic behaviors of a rock mass incorporating its anisotropy these mathematical models can be categorized into four main types selroos et al 2002 lee et al 2001 he et al 2013 a the equivalent continuum ec model b the discrete fracture network dfn model c the dual porosity dp model and d the channel network cn model the features of the four types of models are summarized in table 1 although dfn dp and cn models have been greatly developed in recent years with the rapid improvement in computer performance the ec model is still indispensable in modeling the hydraulic behaviors of fractured rock masses especially for large scale fractured rock masses permeability is the key parameter of the ec model illman 2006 liu et al 2015 2019a b and is anisotropic for most fractured rock masses in the past several decades many researchers have attempted to develop a an experimental procedure to measure or b an analytical model to calculate or c a numerical method to determine the directional permeability in any direction i e the permeability tensor of fractured rock masses lei et al 2015 it should be noted that the permeability tensor which was first proposed by ferrandon 1948 is a tensor that quantitatively represents the anisotropy of permeability the a experimental methods for determining the permeability tensor are mainly either a pumping test or a packer test shapiro et al 1999 he et al 2013 to obtain the directional permeability a series of test wells should be placed in different directions in contrast with respect to b analytical model snow 1969 developed a method for determining the permeability tensor based on the statistical characteristics of critically oriented fractures ignoring the size and spatial variations of fractures rong et al 2013 later oda and his colleague oda 1985 oda et al 1987 developed a calculation method for the permeability tensor considering the orientation three dimensional 3 d size aperture if not specified the aperture in this paper is the hydraulic aperture and density of fractures in addition various c numerical methods have been applied for calculating the permeability in any direction or the permeability tensor of rock masses durlofsky 1991 zhang et al 1996 min et al 2004 chen et al 2008 he et al 2013 rong et al 2013 liu et al 2019a b in essence the a experimental methods are direct measurement method and b analytical model methods and c numerical methods are indirect measurement method by establishing the relation between the hydraulic behaviors of a rock mass and the fracture geometric characteristics the a experimental methods are quite costly and time consuming he et al 2013 and in many cases the permeabilities only in some limited directions can be tested due to the limitation of field test conditions with respect to b analytical model methods and c numerical methods it is one of the key factors determining the success or failure of seepage analysis whether the fracture geometric characteristics conform to the actual rock mass or not in practice the aperture and 3 d size of fractures are extremely difficult to be measured zheng et al 2014 2015 in summary due to the complexity of rock masses there is still no ideal method for calculating the corresponding permeability tensors for engineering practice the main aim of this study is to propose an analytical method to determine the permeability tensor of fractured rock masses the hydraulic aperture and 3 d size of fractures are not expected to be necessary input parameters of this new method as a second aim of the paper an anisotropic index of permeability is defined to describe the anisotropy of permeability for fractured rock masses 2 directional permeability prediction of a rock mass with equal aperture fracture sets first consider a square of rock mass as the analysis zone fig 1 as shown in fig 1 boundary condition 1 denoted as bc1 and the same notation is used for other boundary conditions below and bc4 are constant hydraulic pressures of p 1 and p 2 p 1 p 2 respectively and both bc2 and bc3 linearly decline from p 1 to p 2 the fluid flow in rock masses is commonly assumed to obey the linear darcy s law baghbanan and jing 2007 so the permeability can be expressed as 1 q a k μ δ p δ l where q is the total flow rate on the outflow boundary bc4 m2 s k is the permeability of analysis m2 a is the area of the flow section m which equals the length l of the outflow boundary in two dimensional 2 d space fig 1 μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid pa s p is the hydraulic pressure between the input and outflow boundaries pa which equals p 1 p 2 in fig 1 l is the length of the flow zone m and p l represents the pressure gradient pa m as stated above in fractured tight rock masses the fluid flows primarily within the fractures liu et al 2019a b hence the rock matrix is assumed to be impermeable in this study i e the value of the total flow rate is the sum of all the flow rates through single fractures on the outflow boundary to evaluate the directional permeability we focus on the directional flow rate contribution of every single fracture and the numbers of fractures per unit length in the direction perpendicular to the flow direction for a single fracture the flow rate can be calculated by the cubic law under the parallel plate model snow 1969 which can be expressed as 2 q a 3 12 μ δ p δ l where q is the flow rate through the fracture m2 s and a is the fracture aperture m eq 2 shows that with respect to the same fluid the flow rate through a fracture is a variable that is dependent on the fracture aperture and the pressure gradient a particular fracture may contribute different flow rates with different boundary conditions under various pressure gradients fig 2 we use the unit vector i for the outflow boundary representing the direction of the analysis zone we define q as the standard flow rate where the fracture is normal to the outflow boundary and we use n to represent the unit normal vector for the fracture when the boundary condition changes an angle denoted as θ will exist between n and i hence the flow rate of a fracture could be counted as the standard flow rate times the cosine value of the angle θ which can be expressed as 3 q θ a 3 12 μ δ p δ l i n q i n where n is the unit normal vector for the fracture i is the unit vector for the outflow boundary direction qθ is the flow rate of a fracture with an intersection angle of θ between n and i and q represents the standard flow rate where the fracture is normal to the outflow boundary θ 0 therefore q can be expressed as 4 q a 3 12 μ δ p δ l as shown in fig 3 there is another situation where the fracture connects the adjacent boundaries instead of the opposite boundaries because the pressure decreases linearly from bc2 and bc3 the flow rate can be expressed as 5 q θ a 3 12 μ n δ p n δ l i n q i n where n l is the fracture length n p is the hydraulic pressure between the input and outflow boundaries of the fracture and n is a ratio factor between 0 and 1 obviously eq 5 is the same as eq 3 so for a fracture in either the situation shown in fig 2 or the situation shown in fig 3 the flow rate can be determined by eq 3 the number of fractures per unit length on the outflow boundary direction is another important variable for evaluating the directional permeability the mean linear frequency 1 d density is defined as the number of fractures per unit length in the mean normal direction of the fracture set which can easily be obtained by sampling a line in practice by considering the changes in the linear frequencies in different directions and the flow rate distribution of single fractures mentioned above we can create an equation to predict the directional permeability for a rock mass to be more specific several situations are discussed in the following section 2 1 case 1 some sets of infinite parallel fractures for simplicity first consider a set of parallel fractures with infinite sizes and equal apertures which is labeled as set j the linear frequency is denoted as λj in the normal direction of the fracture set when the unit normal vector nj is parallel to i λj fractures intersect the outflow boundary per unit length fig 4 a when nj is not parallel to i and their intersection angle is labeled θj according to fig 4 b the number nuj of fractures intersecting the outflow boundary per unit length can be determined by 6 n uj λ j cos θ j λ j i n j it is not difficult to find that when nj i λj i nj λj therefore according to eq 3 with respect to any value of θj the total flow rate through the area can be given by 7 q θ j a λ j i n j q j i n j a λ j q j i n j 2 where qθj is the total flow rate of set j in which the subscript θj represents the intersection angle of i and nj and a is the length of the analysis area letting q qθj k kθj q q j and a aj and substituting eqs 1 and 4 into eq 7 can give 8 k θ j λ j a j 3 12 i n j 2 where kθj is the permeability when the intersection angle of i and nj is θj only incorporating the fractures of set j using the principle of adding the contribution from each set the directional permeability kθ incorporating the fractures of all sets can be expressed as 9 k θ j 1 j λ j a j 3 12 i n j 2 where j is the number of fracture sets in theory when the linear density orientation and aperture of fractures are known one can directly compute the permeability in any direction of a rock mass however it should be noted that a the aperture is the effective hydraulic aperture not the geometric aperture of the fractures and b the effective hydraulic aperture of the fractures is extremely difficult to measure directly and is usually obtained by inverse calculation through experiments therefore we consider applying a single well pumping test which is relatively cheap and easy to implement to determine the permeability denoted as kθ1 in some direction i1 and estimate the permeability denoted as kθ2 in another direction i2 according to eq 9 the following equations can be obtained 10 k θ 1 j 1 j λ j a j 3 12 i 1 n j 2 k θ 2 j 1 j λ j a j 3 12 i 2 n j 2 in this section the apertures of different fracture sets are the same i e a1 a2 aj a so eq 10 can give 11 k θ 2 j 1 j λ j i 2 n j 2 j 1 j λ j i 1 n j 2 k θ 1 then a directional factor mθ12 is defined as 12 m θ 12 j 1 j λ j i 2 n j 2 j 1 j λ j i 1 n j 2 then eq 11 can be expressed as 13 k θ 2 m θ 12 k θ 1 2 2 case 2 some sets of infinite nonparallel fractures as is well known there is a very limited number of actual cases where a set of rock fractures are parallel i e typically they are nonparallel zheng et al 2018 therefore this section will discuss the directional permeability of nonparallel fractures with infinite sizes and equal apertures for simplicity a single set denoted as set j of fractures is first considered the linear frequency of the fracture set is denoted as λjm in the mean normal direction of the fracture set the probability density function pdf of the fracture orientations is denoted as g nj similar to case 1 the number nuj of fractures intersecting the unit outflow boundary can be expressed as fig 5 14 n uj λ j m cos θ jm λ jm i n j m where njm is the mean normal vector of set j and θjm is the intersection angle between njm and i for a particular fracture i from set j eq 5 can be transformed into 15 q θ j i q j i n ji where nji is the unit normal vector of fracture i of set j note that eq 15 is based on the assumption that the aperture of each fracture of set j is the same the mean flow rate qθjm of each fracture from set j can be expressed as 16 q θ j m i 1 i q j i n ji i q j e i n j where e i nj is the expected value of i nj i combining eqs 14 and 16 with respect to any value of θjm the total flow rate through the area can be given by 17 q θ j m a n uj q θ j m a λ jm i n j m q j e i n j letting q qθjm k kθjm q q j and a aj and substituting eqs 1 and 4 into eq 17 can give 18 k θ j m λ jm a j 3 12 i n j m e i n j where kθjm is the permeability when the intersection angle of i and njm is θjm only incorporating the fractures of set j similar to eq 9 the directional permeability kθm incorporating the fractures of all sets can be expressed as 19 k θ m j 1 j λ jm a j 3 12 i n j m e i n j where j is the number of fracture sets similar to eq 12 mθ12 can be expressed as 20 m θ 12 j 1 j λ jm i 2 n j m e i 2 n j j 1 j λ jm i 1 n j m e i 1 n j note that kθ2 can be obtained by substituting eq 20 into eq 13 when all fractures from the same set are parallel i2 njm i2 nj i1 njm i1 nj e i2 nj i2 nj and e i1 nj i1 nj thus eq 20 will reduce to eq 12 2 3 case 3 some sets of finite nonparallel fractures in actual rock masses fractures are not only nonparallel but also have limited sizes the directional permeability of nonparallel fractures with finite sizes and equal apertures will be studied as follows similar to case 2 a single set denoted as set j of fractures is first considered the linear frequency of the fracture set is denoted as λjm in the mean normal direction of the fracture set set a scanline in which the direction can be represented as l the linear frequency along the scanline and the fracture plane density are denoted as λlj and λpj respectively the length of the scanline is denoted as l the number of fractures intersected with l is labeled as nlj the pdfs of the fracture orientations and sizes trace length in 2 d space are denoted as g nj and f dj respectively to predict the directional permeability of nonparallel fracture networks with finite sizes the relationship between the plane density λpj and the linear frequency λlj should be developed we propose the following assumptions a the fracture centers are randomly and independently distributed in the plane following a poisson process and b the distributions of fracture orientation and size are independent of each other as shown in fig 6 the necessary and sufficient conditions for a fracture to intersect the scanline l is that the center of the fracture is located inside the rectangle with height l and width dj where dj is the projection of the fracture length on a line perpendicular to l it should be noted that l is the line connecting the midpoint of the rectangle as shown in fig 6 dj can be given by 21 d j d j l n j obviously nlj is equal to the area of the abovementioned rectangle times the fracture plane density therefore considering the distributions of fracture length and orientation in the plane nlj can be expressed as 22 n lj λ pj l 0 d j f d j d d j ω l n j g n j d ω λ pj l e d j e l n j where e is the expected value of the function within the parentheses and dω is a small angle on the plane according to the definition λlj can be expressed as zheng et al 2017 23 λ lj n lj l substitution of eq 22 into eq 23 gives 24 λ lj λ pj e d j e l n j if we select the scanline direction in the mean normal vector direction of the fracture set j then eq 24 can be expressed as 25 λ pj λ jm e d j e n jm n j where njm is the mean normal vector of fracture set j if we select the scanline direction in the direction of i then the combination of eqs 24 and 25 can give 26 n uj e i n j e n jm n j λ jm where nuj is the number of fractures intersecting the outflow boundary per unit length combining eqs 26 and 16 with respect to any value of θjm the total flow rate through the area can be given by 27 q θ j m a n uj q θ j m a λ jm e i n j e n jm n j q j e i n j letting q qθjm k kθjm q q j and a aj and substituting eqs 1 and 4 into eq 27 can give 28 k θ j m λ jm e 2 i n j e n jm n j a j 3 12 i n j m where kθjm is the permeability when the intersection angle of i and njm is θjm only incorporating the fractures of set j similar to eqs 9 and 19 the directional permeability kθm incorporating the fractures of all sets can be expressed as 29 k θ m j 1 j λ jm e 2 i n j e n jm n j a j 3 12 i n j m where j is the number of fracture sets similar to eqs 12 and 20 mθ12 can be expressed as 30 m θ 12 j 1 j λ jm i 2 n j m e n jm n j e 2 i 2 n j j 1 j λ jm i 1 n j m e n jm n j e 2 i 1 n j note that kθ2 can be obtained by substituting eq 30 into eq 13 it should be noted that eq 30 cannot reduce to eq 12 or 20 because when the size of the fractures is infinite the location of the fractures cannot follow a poison process 3 directional permeability prediction of a rock mass with different aperture fracture sets the directional permeability prediction of a fractured rock mass with equal apertures is studied in section 2 this section will discuss a rock mass with different aperture fracture sets the aperture of fracture set j is labeled as aj and a factor t is defined as 31 t j a j a 1 for infinite parallel fractures with different apertures substitution of eq 31 into eq 10 can give 32 m θ 12 j 1 j t j 3 λ j i 2 n j 2 j 1 j t j 3 λ j i 1 n j 2 similarly for infinite nonparallel fractures with different apertures eq 20 transforms into 33 m θ 12 j 1 j t j 3 λ jm i 2 n j m e i 2 n j j 1 j t j 3 λ jm i 1 n j m e i 1 n j with respect to finite nonparallel fractures with different apertures eq 30 transforms into 34 m θ 12 j 1 j t j 3 λ jm i 2 n j m e n jm n j e 2 i 2 n j j 1 j t j 3 λ jm i 1 n j m e n jm n j e 2 i 1 n j note that kθ2 can be obtained by substituting eqs 32 33 or 34 into eq 13 4 permeability tensor and an anisotropy index of permeability for rock masses as described in section 2 one can calculate the directional permeability kθ2 in different directions using eq 13 where m θ12 can be determined by eqs 12 20 30 32 33 or 34 according to different situations based on the results of the directional permeability kθ2 in different directions calculate the values of kθ2 0 5 and draw the curve of θ2 kθ2 0 5 the drawn curve is the permeability ellipse fig 7 wherein the semimajor and semiminor axes and rotation angle of the ellipse are labeled as a b and α respectively then the principal permeabilities can be given by 35 k xx 1 b 2 k yy 1 a 2 where k xx and k yy are the principal permeabilities the permeability kij of the permeability tensor changes as the rotation of the coordinate axes changes and the transform relationship between them is expressed as zhang 2005a b 36 k rs α ri α sj k ij where αri is the cosine of the rotation angle from the i axis to the r axis in a counterclockwise manner note that eq 36 is the transform formula of permeability from the i o j coordinate system to the r s coordinate system when the x o y coordinate system is rotated α counterclockwise to the x o y coordinate system eq 36 can give zhang 2005a b 37

α cos 2 α sin2 α 1 2 sin2 α 1 2 sin2 α cos2 α 1 b 2 1 a 2 0 as stated previously a directional factor mθ12 of permeability was proposed thereby enabling the evaluation of the permeability anisotropy of rock masses to quantitatively describe the permeability anisotropy an anisotropy index of permeability denoted as aip is defined as 40 a i p k q 2 m a x k θ 2 m i n k θ 2 m a x m θ 12 m a x m θ 12 m i n m θ 12 m a x where kθ2max and kθ2min are the maximum and minimum values of the permeability in different directions respectively and mθ12max and mθ12min are the maximum and minimum values of the directional factor in different directions respectively eq 40 shows that a if mθ12max mθ12min i e the values of mθ12 are the same in different directions then aip 0 b if mθ12max mθ12min or mθ12min 0 then aip 1 and c the range of aip is from 0 to 1 and the larger value of aip reflects stronger anisotropy of the permeability of a rock mass for two sets of fractures with finite sizes the expected intersection angle between the two sets is an important factor that influences the value of aip as the angle varies from 0 to 90 degrees the value of aip decreases correspondingly 5 validation for a rock mass with equal aperture fracture sets by experiments 5 1 procedure for the experiments to validate the method developed in this study some experiments were conducted with the universal distinct element code udec itasca 2015 udec is a 2 d distinct element code that can be used to evaluate the hydraulic behavior of fractured rock masses min et al 2004 fifteen 20 m 20 m dfn models were generated based on five different geometric parameters of fractures by monte carlo simulation in matlab mathworks 2018 table 2 note that there are five groups of geometric parameters of fractures and with respect to each group three dfn models were repeatedly generated since the purpose is to evaluate the directional permeability a 10 m 10 m block in the 20 m 20 m generated model rotates 15 degrees around the zone center in every rotation from 0 to 345 degrees 24 rotations for each dfn model fig 8 the rotation angle was denoted as θ each 10 m 10 m block is the final analysis zone which was imported into the udec steady flow was adopted and the flow rate under the hydraulic boundary conditions see fig 1 was calculated by the mass continuity equation solving through an iterative scheme 5 2 results and analysis for five different analysis groups table 2 the predicted values of directional permeability along with the real values are given in figs 9 13 it should be noted that a the predicted values of groups 1 and 2 are obtained according to eqs 12 and 13 b the predicted values of group 3 are given by eqs 20 and 13 c the predicted values of groups 4 and 5 are given by eqs 30 and 13 d the calculated values of directional permeability from udec are regarded as their real values and e the twenty three predicted values kθ2 θ2 15 30 330 345 degrees are based on one known value kθ1 where θ1 0 degrees i e the real value of k0 as a known value is used to predict the other twenty three values of permeability figs 9 and 10 are the results of directional permeability for infinite parallel fractures with equal apertures case 1 in section 2 the results show that the predicted values are very close to the real ones with respect to infinite nonparallel fractures with equal apertures case 2 in section 2 the results are given in fig 11 fig 11 also shows that the predicted values fit well with the real values the results for finite nonparallel fractures with equal apertures case 3 in section 2 are shown in figs 12 and 13 according to the two figures it is not difficult to find that the predicted result is also quite good to further quantitatively compare the predicted and real values of directional permeability the mean error rate of the twenty three predicted values for each dfn model are computed and the results are plotted in fig 14 fig 14 shows that a for a single set of infinite parallel fractures with equal apertures group 1 the mean error rate varies from 8 6 to 11 8 b for two sets of infinite parallel fractures with equal apertures group 2 the mean error rate ranges between 9 4 and 11 5 c the error rate does not seem to increase as the number of fracture sets increase d the mean error rate changes from 7 1 to 13 2 for two sets of infinite nonparallel fractures with equal apertures group 3 and e for two sets of finite nonparallel fractures with equal apertures groups 4 and 5 the mean error rates are 8 6 13 4 and 10 8 11 4 for two different intersection angles of fractures therefore the mean error rate is approximately 10 for all cases with equal apertures and the estimation method for directional permeability proposed in this study is valid and worth popularizing it should be noted that the aforementioned mean error rate is the mean error rate of the twenty three predicted values for each dfn model as described above the 24 dfn models 10 m 10 m blocks were cut from the large block 20 m 20 m by the rotation around the zone center fig 8 consequently the 24 dfn models are not exactly the same except for orientations of fractures and the mean linear frequencies of fractures may be not exactly equal eqs 12 20 and 30 clearly show that the value of directional permeability is sensitive to the mean linear frequencies of fractures furthermore it should be noted that the proposed method does not consider flow interference effects at fracture intersections wilson and witherspoon 1976 johnson et al 2006 as stated above the error rate does not increase as the number of fracture sets increase for example the mean error rates of groups 1 and group 2 are at the same level it seems that the flow interference effects at fracture intersections affect little on the rock mass with equal aperture fracture sets therefore it can be believed that the dfn model errors in udec are the main reason for the computed errors with respect to a rock mass with equal aperture fracture sets and the real error rates from the proposed methods are less than the computed error rates above in addition the predicted and real values of aip for all groups are calculated according to eq 40 which are plotted in fig 15 for a single set of infinite parallel fractures with equal apertures group 1 because the minimum permeability is zero both predicted and real values of aip are equal to 1 which means that the anisotropy of the permeability is extremely strong the values of aip of infinite parallel fractures group 2 are slightly larger than those of infinite nonparallel fractures group 3 i e the increase in fracture orientation dispersion leads to weak anisotropy of the permeability of a rock mass for a rock mass with two finite nonparallel fractures groups 4 and 5 the anisotropy of the permeability decreases as the intersection angle of the two sets increases the comparison between the predicted and real anisotropy as shown in fig 15 further indicates that the developed method has good capacity to estimate the permeability of fractured rock masses case 1 of group 5 is used as an example to illustrate the calculation procedure for the permeability tensor of the rock mass based on the values of directional permeability the permeability ellipse can be fitted fig 16 then according to the permeability ellipse the values of α a and b can be measured thereafter k xx and k yy can be calculated by substituting a and b into eq 35 substituting α a b k xx and k yy into eq 39 can give the permeability tensor of the rock mass which can be expressed as 41 k xx k yy k xy 8 3e 16 1 93e 16 1 1e 16 6 validation for a rock mass with different aperture fracture sets by experiments 6 1 procedure for the experiments as introduced in section 5 1 similar dfn models were generated and the same method and hydraulic boundary conditions were applied the apertures for different sets are different and the aperture ratio t varies from two to four there are six groups of geometric parameters of fractures table 3 and with respect to each group three dfn models were repeatedly generated 6 2 results and analysis for the six different analysis groups table 3 the similar figures of figs 9 13 can be obtained from eqs 34 and 13 the results of group 9 as examples are shown in fig 17 it should be noted that a the calculated values of directional permeability from udec are regarded as their real values and b the twenty three predicted values kθ2 θ2 15 30 330 345 degrees are based on one known value kθ1 where θ1 0 degrees i e the real value of k0 as a known value is used to predict the other twenty three values of permeability compared to the results with equal apertures section 5 2 the predicted values for different apertures seem to have a slightly higher mean error rate to further quantitatively compare their differences the mean error rates of the twenty three predicted values for each dfn model are computed and the results are plotted in fig 18 fig 18 shows that a with respect to the two sets with an intersection angle of 30 degrees the error rate varies from 8 6 to 13 4 3 repetitive cases to 18 7 21 8 3 repetitive cases as the aperture ratio increases from 1 to 4 b for two sets with an intersection angle of 60 degrees and the same change in the aperture ratio the error rate varies from 10 8 to 11 4 3 repetitive cases to 16 0 28 9 3 repetitive cases as the aperture ratio increases from 1 to 4 c for both of these intersection angles the mean error rate increases slightly as the aperture ratio increases and d the mean error rate tends to increase as the aperture ratio increases therefore the proposed method seems to be applicable to small rock mass aperture ratios e g less than 3 it should be noted that the aforementioned mean error rate is the mean error rate of the twenty three predicted values for each dfn model similar to the rock mass with equal aperture fracture sets it can also be believed that the dfn model errors in udec are one of the reasons for the computed errors with respect to a rock mass with different aperture fracture sets and the real errors from the proposed methods are less than the computed errors above furthermore as stated above the proposed method does not consider flow interference effects at fracture intersections wilson and witherspoon 1976 johnson et al 2006 when two crossed fractures have different apertures then the flow velocities through them are different the larger the velocity difference the more obvious the flow interference effect which can well explain the above result that the mean error rate tends to increase as the aperture ratio increases therefore it can be believed that with respect to a rock mass with different aperture fracture sets the computed errors are due to a the dfn model errors in udec and b flow interference effects at fracture intersections in addition the predicted and real values of aip for all groups are calculated according to eq 40 which are plotted in fig 19 the information in fig 19 shows that there are differences in aip between intersection angles of 30 degrees and 60 degrees and the differences decrease with increasing aperture ratio it seems that for a rock mass with two fracture sets the aip will increase as the intersection angle of the two sets increases and decrease as the aperture ratio of the two sets increases 7 discussion the predictive method of the permeability tensor is applicable only to a rock mass with a representative elementary volume rev because if the rev does not exist the ec model cannot be used to analyze the hydraulic behaviors of the rock mass therefore when using the proposed method the size of the analyzed rock mass should be not less than its rev the key step of the proposed determination method is to derive the theoretical relationship between the permeabilities in two different directions the theoretical derivation incorporates the variance in the discontinuity orientations and sizes of the fracture sets however the size parameter does not exist in the final formula which is one advantage over the classic oda models in addition the values of hydraulic apertures of the fracture sets are not required as input in the proposed formula only the aperture ratios of different fracture sets are required it should be noted that the values of the hydraulic aperture are extremely difficult to directly measure but their ratios can be estimated by their geometric apertures which are more easily sampled in the field this feature of the developed formula is another superiority over the classic oda models a value of the permeability in some direction is required in the proposed method a single well pumping test is suggested for determining the permeability in some direction this test is relatively cheap and easy to implement moreover the test result can reflect the comprehensive characteristics of a rock mass in some direction which involves the influence of in situ stress and filling material along with geometric parameters of fractures therefore the predictive results are likely to be better than those from existing methods only considering the geometric parameters of fractures considering that it is not easy to perform validation for 3 d complicated dfns the current method is developed in 2 d space however actual rock masses are in 3 d space and their hydraulic behaviors usually have obvious 3 d effects therefore the proposed method will be expanded to 3 d space in future research last but not least it should be noted that the proposed method is only validated by numerical modelling and need to be tested in practices 8 concluding remarks an analytical method is developed to determine the permeability tensor of fractured rock masses based on the orientation and linear frequency 1 d density of fractures along with a value of the permeability in any direction the key step of this method is to derive the theoretical relationship between the permeabilities in two different directions in contrast to the classic oda model oda 1985 the fracture size and hydraulic aperture do not need to be input into the developed formulas the orientation and linear frequency of fractures are usually the basic parameters of the investigations in rock engineering zheng et al 2018 2019 and can be easily sampled in practice the value of the permeability in some direction can be tested by a single well pumping test which is relatively cheap and easy to implement actually the proposed method can be regarded as a hybrid method of theoretical analysis and experiment in addition an anisotropy index of permeability aip is defined to quantitatively describe the permeability anisotropy to validate the method developed in this study some experiments were conducted with the udec the results show that the predicted values are very close to the real ones and the detailed results are as follows a for all cases of rock masses with equal aperture fracture sets the mean error rate of permeabilities in 23 different directions is approximately 10 7 1 13 4 whereas b for rock masses with different aperture fracture sets the mean error rate increases from 8 6 to 28 9 as the aperture ratio increases from 1 to 4 therefore the estimation method for directional permeability proposed in this study is valid especially for those rock masses in which the aperture ratios of the fracture sets are small e g less than 3 furthermore when using the proposed method the size of the analyzed rock mass should be not less than its rev in addition the current method is developed in 2 d space and will be expanded to 3 d space in future research credit authorship

5576,hydraulic characteristics are important fundamental properties of fractured rock masses and involve various geoscience and engineering disciplines the determination of the permeability tensor is the basic input of the equivalent continuum ec model for hydraulic behavior analysis an analytical method to determine the permeability tensor of fractured rock masses is developed based on the orientation and linear frequency of fractures along with a value of the permeability in any direction the orientation and linear frequency of fractures can be easily sampled in practice and the value of the permeability in some direction can be tested by a relatively cheap single well pumping test the key step of this method is to derive the theoretical relationship between the permeabilities in two different directions in addition an anisotropy index of permeability aip is defined to quantitatively describe the permeability anisotropy some numerical experiments were conducted with the universal distinct element code udec to validate the developed method the results show that a the predicted values are very close to the real ones b for all cases of rock masses with equal aperture fracture sets the mean error rate of the permeabilities in 23 different directions is approximately 10 c for rock masses with different aperture fracture sets the mean error rate increases from 8 6 to 28 9 as the aperture ratio increases from 1 to 4 and d therefore the estimation method for directional permeability proposed in this study is valid especially for those rock masses in which the aperture ratios of the fracture sets are small e g less than 3 keywords discrete fracture network dfn permeability tensor directional permeability fractured rock masses equivalent continuum model hydraulic behavior 1 introduction the hydraulic responses of fractured rock masses to pressure gradients are the focus of various geoscience and engineering disciplines lang et al 2014 such as hydrogeology engineering geology hydropower engineering mining engineering petroleum engineering underground engineering geothermal engineering and environmental engineering with respect to fractured tight rock masses such as granite and basalt the hydraulic behaviors are primarily governed by the existing fractures liu et al 2019a b rong et al 2013 not the rock matrix hence such rock masses usually exhibit significant anisotropy it should be noted that in this paper the term fracture is a general expression for separations in rock masses zhang 2005a b mainly including all cracks fissures schistosity planes joints bedding planes and faults isrm 1978 mathematical model methods are believed to be effective means to investigate the hydraulic behaviors of a rock mass incorporating its anisotropy these mathematical models can be categorized into four main types selroos et al 2002 lee et al 2001 he et al 2013 a the equivalent continuum ec model b the discrete fracture network dfn model c the dual porosity dp model and d the channel network cn model the features of the four types of models are summarized in table 1 although dfn dp and cn models have been greatly developed in recent years with the rapid improvement in computer performance the ec model is still indispensable in modeling the hydraulic behaviors of fractured rock masses especially for large scale fractured rock masses permeability is the key parameter of the ec model illman 2006 liu et al 2015 2019a b and is anisotropic for most fractured rock masses in the past several decades many researchers have attempted to develop a an experimental procedure to measure or b an analytical model to calculate or c a numerical method to determine the directional permeability in any direction i e the permeability tensor of fractured rock masses lei et al 2015 it should be noted that the permeability tensor which was first proposed by ferrandon 1948 is a tensor that quantitatively represents the anisotropy of permeability the a experimental methods for determining the permeability tensor are mainly either a pumping test or a packer test shapiro et al 1999 he et al 2013 to obtain the directional permeability a series of test wells should be placed in different directions in contrast with respect to b analytical model snow 1969 developed a method for determining the permeability tensor based on the statistical characteristics of critically oriented fractures ignoring the size and spatial variations of fractures rong et al 2013 later oda and his colleague oda 1985 oda et al 1987 developed a calculation method for the permeability tensor considering the orientation three dimensional 3 d size aperture if not specified the aperture in this paper is the hydraulic aperture and density of fractures in addition various c numerical methods have been applied for calculating the permeability in any direction or the permeability tensor of rock masses durlofsky 1991 zhang et al 1996 min et al 2004 chen et al 2008 he et al 2013 rong et al 2013 liu et al 2019a b in essence the a experimental methods are direct measurement method and b analytical model methods and c numerical methods are indirect measurement method by establishing the relation between the hydraulic behaviors of a rock mass and the fracture geometric characteristics the a experimental methods are quite costly and time consuming he et al 2013 and in many cases the permeabilities only in some limited directions can be tested due to the limitation of field test conditions with respect to b analytical model methods and c numerical methods it is one of the key factors determining the success or failure of seepage analysis whether the fracture geometric characteristics conform to the actual rock mass or not in practice the aperture and 3 d size of fractures are extremely difficult to be measured zheng et al 2014 2015 in summary due to the complexity of rock masses there is still no ideal method for calculating the corresponding permeability tensors for engineering practice the main aim of this study is to propose an analytical method to determine the permeability tensor of fractured rock masses the hydraulic aperture and 3 d size of fractures are not expected to be necessary input parameters of this new method as a second aim of the paper an anisotropic index of permeability is defined to describe the anisotropy of permeability for fractured rock masses 2 directional permeability prediction of a rock mass with equal aperture fracture sets first consider a square of rock mass as the analysis zone fig 1 as shown in fig 1 boundary condition 1 denoted as bc1 and the same notation is used for other boundary conditions below and bc4 are constant hydraulic pressures of p 1 and p 2 p 1 p 2 respectively and both bc2 and bc3 linearly decline from p 1 to p 2 the fluid flow in rock masses is commonly assumed to obey the linear darcy s law baghbanan and jing 2007 so the permeability can be expressed as 1 q a k μ δ p δ l where q is the total flow rate on the outflow boundary bc4 m2 s k is the permeability of analysis m2 a is the area of the flow section m which equals the length l of the outflow boundary in two dimensional 2 d space fig 1 μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid pa s p is the hydraulic pressure between the input and outflow boundaries pa which equals p 1 p 2 in fig 1 l is the length of the flow zone m and p l represents the pressure gradient pa m as stated above in fractured tight rock masses the fluid flows primarily within the fractures liu et al 2019a b hence the rock matrix is assumed to be impermeable in this study i e the value of the total flow rate is the sum of all the flow rates through single fractures on the outflow boundary to evaluate the directional permeability we focus on the directional flow rate contribution of every single fracture and the numbers of fractures per unit length in the direction perpendicular to the flow direction for a single fracture the flow rate can be calculated by the cubic law under the parallel plate model snow 1969 which can be expressed as 2 q a 3 12 μ δ p δ l where q is the flow rate through the fracture m2 s and a is the fracture aperture m eq 2 shows that with respect to the same fluid the flow rate through a fracture is a variable that is dependent on the fracture aperture and the pressure gradient a particular fracture may contribute different flow rates with different boundary conditions under various pressure gradients fig 2 we use the unit vector i for the outflow boundary representing the direction of the analysis zone we define q as the standard flow rate where the fracture is normal to the outflow boundary and we use n to represent the unit normal vector for the fracture when the boundary condition changes an angle denoted as θ will exist between n and i hence the flow rate of a fracture could be counted as the standard flow rate times the cosine value of the angle θ which can be expressed as 3 q θ a 3 12 μ δ p δ l i n q i n where n is the unit normal vector for the fracture i is the unit vector for the outflow boundary direction qθ is the flow rate of a fracture with an intersection angle of θ between n and i and q represents the standard flow rate where the fracture is normal to the outflow boundary θ 0 therefore q can be expressed as 4 q a 3 12 μ δ p δ l as shown in fig 3 there is another situation where the fracture connects the adjacent boundaries instead of the opposite boundaries because the pressure decreases linearly from bc2 and bc3 the flow rate can be expressed as 5 q θ a 3 12 μ n δ p n δ l i n q i n where n l is the fracture length n p is the hydraulic pressure between the input and outflow boundaries of the fracture and n is a ratio factor between 0 and 1 obviously eq 5 is the same as eq 3 so for a fracture in either the situation shown in fig 2 or the situation shown in fig 3 the flow rate can be determined by eq 3 the number of fractures per unit length on the outflow boundary direction is another important variable for evaluating the directional permeability the mean linear frequency 1 d density is defined as the number of fractures per unit length in the mean normal direction of the fracture set which can easily be obtained by sampling a line in practice by considering the changes in the linear frequencies in different directions and the flow rate distribution of single fractures mentioned above we can create an equation to predict the directional permeability for a rock mass to be more specific several situations are discussed in the following section 2 1 case 1 some sets of infinite parallel fractures for simplicity first consider a set of parallel fractures with infinite sizes and equal apertures which is labeled as set j the linear frequency is denoted as λj in the normal direction of the fracture set when the unit normal vector nj is parallel to i λj fractures intersect the outflow boundary per unit length fig 4 a when nj is not parallel to i and their intersection angle is labeled θj according to fig 4 b the number nuj of fractures intersecting the outflow boundary per unit length can be determined by 6 n uj λ j cos θ j λ j i n j it is not difficult to find that when nj i λj i nj λj therefore according to eq 3 with respect to any value of θj the total flow rate through the area can be given by 7 q θ j a λ j i n j q j i n j a λ j q j i n j 2 where qθj is the total flow rate of set j in which the subscript θj represents the intersection angle of i and nj and a is the length of the analysis area letting q qθj k kθj q q j and a aj and substituting eqs 1 and 4 into eq 7 can give 8 k θ j λ j a j 3 12 i n j 2 where kθj is the permeability when the intersection angle of i and nj is θj only incorporating the fractures of set j using the principle of adding the contribution from each set the directional permeability kθ incorporating the fractures of all sets can be expressed as 9 k θ j 1 j λ j a j 3 12 i n j 2 where j is the number of fracture sets in theory when the linear density orientation and aperture of fractures are known one can directly compute the permeability in any direction of a rock mass however it should be noted that a the aperture is the effective hydraulic aperture not the geometric aperture of the fractures and b the effective hydraulic aperture of the fractures is extremely difficult to measure directly and is usually obtained by inverse calculation through experiments therefore we consider applying a single well pumping test which is relatively cheap and easy to implement to determine the permeability denoted as kθ1 in some direction i1 and estimate the permeability denoted as kθ2 in another direction i2 according to eq 9 the following equations can be obtained 10 k θ 1 j 1 j λ j a j 3 12 i 1 n j 2 k θ 2 j 1 j λ j a j 3 12 i 2 n j 2 in this section the apertures of different fracture sets are the same i e a1 a2 aj a so eq 10 can give 11 k θ 2 j 1 j λ j i 2 n j 2 j 1 j λ j i 1 n j 2 k θ 1 then a directional factor mθ12 is defined as 12 m θ 12 j 1 j λ j i 2 n j 2 j 1 j λ j i 1 n j 2 then eq 11 can be expressed as 13 k θ 2 m θ 12 k θ 1 2 2 case 2 some sets of infinite nonparallel fractures as is well known there is a very limited number of actual cases where a set of rock fractures are parallel i e typically they are nonparallel zheng et al 2018 therefore this section will discuss the directional permeability of nonparallel fractures with infinite sizes and equal apertures for simplicity a single set denoted as set j of fractures is first considered the linear frequency of the fracture set is denoted as λjm in the mean normal direction of the fracture set the probability density function pdf of the fracture orientations is denoted as g nj similar to case 1 the number nuj of fractures intersecting the unit outflow boundary can be expressed as fig 5 14 n uj λ j m cos θ jm λ jm i n j m where njm is the mean normal vector of set j and θjm is the intersection angle between njm and i for a particular fracture i from set j eq 5 can be transformed into 15 q θ j i q j i n ji where nji is the unit normal vector of fracture i of set j note that eq 15 is based on the assumption that the aperture of each fracture of set j is the same the mean flow rate qθjm of each fracture from set j can be expressed as 16 q θ j m i 1 i q j i n ji i q j e i n j where e i nj is the expected value of i nj i combining eqs 14 and 16 with respect to any value of θjm the total flow rate through the area can be given by 17 q θ j m a n uj q θ j m a λ jm i n j m q j e i n j letting q qθjm k kθjm q q j and a aj and substituting eqs 1 and 4 into eq 17 can give 18 k θ j m λ jm a j 3 12 i n j m e i n j where kθjm is the permeability when the intersection angle of i and njm is θjm only incorporating the fractures of set j similar to eq 9 the directional permeability kθm incorporating the fractures of all sets can be expressed as 19 k θ m j 1 j λ jm a j 3 12 i n j m e i n j where j is the number of fracture sets similar to eq 12 mθ12 can be expressed as 20 m θ 12 j 1 j λ jm i 2 n j m e i 2 n j j 1 j λ jm i 1 n j m e i 1 n j note that kθ2 can be obtained by substituting eq 20 into eq 13 when all fractures from the same set are parallel i2 njm i2 nj i1 njm i1 nj e i2 nj i2 nj and e i1 nj i1 nj thus eq 20 will reduce to eq 12 2 3 case 3 some sets of finite nonparallel fractures in actual rock masses fractures are not only nonparallel but also have limited sizes the directional permeability of nonparallel fractures with finite sizes and equal apertures will be studied as follows similar to case 2 a single set denoted as set j of fractures is first considered the linear frequency of the fracture set is denoted as λjm in the mean normal direction of the fracture set set a scanline in which the direction can be represented as l the linear frequency along the scanline and the fracture plane density are denoted as λlj and λpj respectively the length of the scanline is denoted as l the number of fractures intersected with l is labeled as nlj the pdfs of the fracture orientations and sizes trace length in 2 d space are denoted as g nj and f dj respectively to predict the directional permeability of nonparallel fracture networks with finite sizes the relationship between the plane density λpj and the linear frequency λlj should be developed we propose the following assumptions a the fracture centers are randomly and independently distributed in the plane following a poisson process and b the distributions of fracture orientation and size are independent of each other as shown in fig 6 the necessary and sufficient conditions for a fracture to intersect the scanline l is that the center of the fracture is located inside the rectangle with height l and width dj where dj is the projection of the fracture length on a line perpendicular to l it should be noted that l is the line connecting the midpoint of the rectangle as shown in fig 6 dj can be given by 21 d j d j l n j obviously nlj is equal to the area of the abovementioned rectangle times the fracture plane density therefore considering the distributions of fracture length and orientation in the plane nlj can be expressed as 22 n lj λ pj l 0 d j f d j d d j ω l n j g n j d ω λ pj l e d j e l n j where e is the expected value of the function within the parentheses and dω is a small angle on the plane according to the definition λlj can be expressed as zheng et al 2017 23 λ lj n lj l substitution of eq 22 into eq 23 gives 24 λ lj λ pj e d j e l n j if we select the scanline direction in the mean normal vector direction of the fracture set j then eq 24 can be expressed as 25 λ pj λ jm e d j e n jm n j where njm is the mean normal vector of fracture set j if we select the scanline direction in the direction of i then the combination of eqs 24 and 25 can give 26 n uj e i n j e n jm n j λ jm where nuj is the number of fractures intersecting the outflow boundary per unit length combining eqs 26 and 16 with respect to any value of θjm the total flow rate through the area can be given by 27 q θ j m a n uj q θ j m a λ jm e i n j e n jm n j q j e i n j letting q qθjm k kθjm q q j and a aj and substituting eqs 1 and 4 into eq 27 can give 28 k θ j m λ jm e 2 i n j e n jm n j a j

30 cannot reduce to eq 12 or 20 because when the size of the fractures is infinite the location of the fractures cannot follow a poison process 3 directional permeability prediction of a rock mass with different aperture fracture sets the directional permeability prediction of a fractured rock mass with equal apertures is studied in section 2 this section will discuss a rock mass with different aperture fracture sets the aperture of fracture set j is labeled as aj and a factor t is defined as 31 t j a j a 1 for infinite parallel fractures with different apertures substitution of eq 31 into eq 10 can give 32 m θ 12 j 1 j t j 3 λ j i 2 n j 2 j 1 j t j 3 λ j i 1 n j 2 similarly for infinite nonparallel fractures with different apertures eq 20 transforms into 33 m θ 12 j 1 j t j 3 λ jm i 2

n j j 1 j t j 3 λ jm i 1 n j m e n jm n j e 2 i 1 n j note that kθ2 can be obtained by substituting eqs 32 33 or 34 into eq 13 4 permeability tensor and an anisotropy index of permeability for rock masses as described in section 2 one can calculate the directional permeability kθ2 in different directions using eq 13 where m θ12 can be determined by eqs 12 20 30 32 33 or 34 according to different situations based on the results of the directional permeability kθ2 in different directions calculate the values of kθ2 0 5 and draw the curve of θ2 kθ2 0 5 the drawn curve is the permeability ellipse fig 7 wherein the semimajor and semiminor axes and rotation angle of the ellipse are labeled as a b and α respectively then the principal permeabilities can be given by 35 k xx 1 b 2 k yy 1 a 2 where k xx and k yy are the principal permeabilities the permeability kij of the permeability tensor changes as the rotation of the coordinate axes changes and the transform relationship between them is expressed as zhang 2005a b 36 k rs α ri α sj k ij where αri is the cosine of the rotation angle from the i axis to the r axis in a counterclockwise manner note that eq 36 is the transform formula of permeability from the i o j coordinate system to the r s coordinate system when the x o y coordinate system is rotated α counterclockwise to the x o y coordinate system eq 36 can give zhang 2005a b 37 k x x k y y k x y cos 2 α si n 2 α sin2 α sin 2 α cos 2 α sin2 α 1 2 sin2 α 1 2 sin2 α cos2 α k xx k yy k xy where kij and ki j are the permeabilities of the tensor in the x o y and x o y coordinate systems respectively according to fig 7 letting α α and substituting α into eq 37 can give 38 k xx k yy k xy cos 2 α si n 2 α sin2 α sin 2 α cos 2 α sin2 α 1 2 sin2 α 1 2 sin2 α cos2 α k x x k y y k x y substitution of eq 35 and kx y 0 into eq 38 gives the formula for the permeability tensor based on the permeability ellipse which can be expressed as 39 k xx k yy k xy cos 2 α si n 2 α sin2 α sin 2 α cos 2 α sin2 α 1 2 sin2 α 1 2 sin2 α cos2 α 1 b 2 1 a 2 0 as stated previously a directional factor mθ12 of permeability was proposed thereby enabling the evaluation of the permeability anisotropy of rock masses to quantitatively describe the permeability anisotropy an anisotropy index of permeability denoted as aip is defined as 40 a i p k q 2 m a x k θ 2 m i n k θ 2 m a x m θ 12 m a x m θ 12 m i n m θ 12 m a x where kθ2max and kθ2min are the maximum and minimum values of the permeability in different directions respectively and mθ12max and mθ12min are the maximum and minimum values of the directional factor in different directions respectively eq 40 shows that a if mθ12max mθ12min i e the values of mθ12 are the same in different directions then aip 0 b if mθ12max mθ12min or mθ12min 0 then aip 1 and c the range of aip is from 0 to 1 and the larger value of aip reflects stronger anisotropy of the permeability of a rock mass for two sets of fractures with finite sizes the expected intersection angle between the two sets is an important factor that influences the value of aip as the angle varies from 0 to 90 degrees the value of aip decreases correspondingly 5 validation for a rock mass with equal aperture fracture sets by experiments 5 1 procedure for the experiments to validate the method developed in this study some experiments were conducted with the universal distinct element code udec itasca 2015 udec is a 2 d distinct element code that can be used to evaluate the hydraulic behavior of fractured rock masses min et al 2004 fifteen 20 m 20 m dfn models were generated based on five different geometric parameters of fractures by monte carlo simulation in matlab mathworks 2018 table 2 note that there are five groups of geometric parameters of fractures and with respect to each group three dfn models were repeatedly generated since the purpose is to evaluate the directional permeability a 10 m 10 m block in the 20 m 20 m generated model rotates 15 degrees around the zone center in every rotation from 0 to 345 degrees 24 rotations for each dfn model fig 8 the rotation angle was denoted as θ each 10 m 10 m block is the final analysis zone which was imported into the udec steady flow was adopted and the flow rate under the hydraulic boundary conditions see fig 1 was calculated by the mass continuity equation solving through an iterative scheme 5 2 results and analysis for five different analysis groups table 2 the predicted values of directional permeability along with the real values are given in figs 9 13 it should be noted that a the predicted values of groups 1 and 2 are obtained according to eqs 12 and 13 b the predicted values of group 3 are given by eqs 20 and 13 c the predicted values of groups 4 and 5 are given by eqs 30 and 13 d the calculated values of directional permeability from udec are regarded as their real values and e the twenty three predicted values kθ2 θ2 15 30 330 345 degrees are based on one known value kθ1 where θ1 0 degrees i e the real value of k0 as a known value is used to predict the other twenty three values of permeability figs 9 and 10 are the results of directional permeability for infinite parallel fractures with equal apertures case 1 in section 2 the results show that the predicted values are very close to the real ones with respect to infinite nonparallel fractures with equal apertures case 2 in section 2 the results are given in fig 11 fig 11 also shows that the predicted values fit well with the real values the results for finite nonparallel fractures with equal apertures case 3 in section 2 are shown in figs 12 and 13 according to the two figures it is not difficult to find that the predicted result is also quite good to further quantitatively compare the predicted and real values of directional permeability the mean error rate of the twenty three predicted values for each dfn model are computed and the results are plotted in fig 14 fig 14 shows that a for a single set of infinite parallel fractures with equal apertures group 1 the mean error rate varies from 8 6 to 11 8 b for two sets of infinite parallel fractures with equal apertures group 2 the mean error rate ranges between 9 4 and 11 5 c the error rate does not seem to increase as the number of fracture sets increase d the mean error rate changes from 7 1 to 13 2 for two sets of infinite nonparallel fractures with equal apertures group 3 and e for two sets of finite nonparallel fractures with equal apertures groups 4 and 5 the mean error rates are 8 6 13 4 and 10 8 11 4 for two different intersection angles of fractures therefore the mean error rate is approximately 10 for all cases with equal apertures and the estimation method for directional permeability proposed in this study is valid and worth popularizing it should be noted that the aforementioned mean error rate is the mean error rate of the twenty three predicted values for each dfn model as described above the 24 dfn models 10 m 10 m blocks were cut from the large block 20 m 20 m by the rotation around the zone center fig 8 consequently the 24 dfn models are not exactly the same except for orientations of fractures and the mean linear frequencies of fractures may be not exactly equal eqs 12 20 and 30 clearly show that the value of directional permeability is sensitive to the mean linear frequencies of fractures furthermore it should be noted that the proposed method does not consider flow interference effects at fracture intersections wilson and witherspoon 1976 johnson et al 2006 as stated above the error rate does not increase as the number of fracture sets increase for example the mean error rates of groups 1 and group 2 are at the same level it seems that the flow interference effects at fracture intersections affect little on the rock mass with equal aperture fracture sets therefore it can be believed that the dfn model errors in udec are the main reason for the computed errors with respect to a rock mass with equal aperture fracture sets and the real error rates from the proposed methods are less than the computed error rates above in addition the predicted and real values of aip for all groups are calculated according to eq 40 which are plotted in fig 15 for a single set of infinite parallel fractures with equal apertures group 1 because the minimum permeability is zero both predicted and real values of aip are equal to 1 which means that the anisotropy of the permeability is extremely strong the values of aip of infinite parallel fractures group 2 are slightly larger than those of infinite nonparallel fractures group 3 i e the increase in fracture orientation dispersion leads to weak anisotropy of the permeability of a rock mass for a rock mass with two finite nonparallel fractures groups 4 and 5 the anisotropy of the permeability decreases as the intersection angle of the two sets increases the comparison between the predicted and real anisotropy as shown in fig 15 further indicates that the developed method has good capacity to estimate the permeability of fractured rock masses case 1 of group 5 is used as an example to illustrate the calculation procedure for the permeability tensor of the rock mass based on the values of directional permeability the permeability ellipse can be fitted fig 16 then according to the permeability ellipse the values of α a and b can be measured thereafter k xx and k yy can be calculated by substituting a and b into eq 35 substituting α a b k xx and k yy into eq 39 can give the permeability tensor of the rock mass which can be expressed as 41 k xx k yy k xy 8 3e 16 1 93e 16 1 1e 16 6 validation for a rock mass with different aperture fracture sets by experiments 6 1 procedure for the experiments as introduced in section 5 1 similar dfn models were generated and the same method and hydraulic boundary conditions were applied the apertures for different sets are different and the aperture ratio t varies from two to four there are six groups of geometric parameters of fractures table 3 and with respect to each group three dfn models were repeatedly generated 6 2 results and analysis for the six different analysis groups table 3 the similar figures of figs 9 13 can be obtained from eqs 34 and 13 the results of group 9 as examples are shown in fig 17 it should be noted that a the calculated values of directional permeability from udec are regarded as their real values and b the twenty three predicted values kθ2 θ2 15 30 330 345 degrees are based on one known value kθ1 where θ1 0 degrees i e the real value of k0 as a known value is used to predict the other twenty three values of permeability compared to the results with equal apertures section 5 2 the predicted values for different apertures seem to have a slightly higher mean error rate to further quantitatively compare their differences the mean error rates of the twenty three predicted values for each dfn model are computed and the results are plotted in fig 18 fig 18 shows that a with respect to the two sets with an intersection angle of 30 degrees the error rate varies from 8 6 to 13 4 3 repetitive cases to 18 7 21 8 3 repetitive cases as the aperture ratio increases from 1 to 4 b for two sets with an intersection angle of 60 degrees and the same change in the aperture ratio the error rate varies from 10 8 to 11 4 3 repetitive cases to 16 0 28 9 3 repetitive cases as the aperture ratio increases from 1 to 4 c for both of these intersection angles the mean error rate increases slightly as the aperture ratio increases and d the mean error rate tends to increase as the aperture ratio increases therefore the proposed method seems to be applicable to small rock mass aperture ratios e g less than 3 it should be noted that the aforementioned mean error rate is the mean error rate of the twenty three predicted values for each dfn model similar to the rock mass with equal aperture fracture sets it can also be believed that the dfn model errors in udec are one of the reasons for the computed errors with respect to a rock mass with different aperture fracture sets and the real errors from the proposed methods are less than the computed errors above furthermore as stated above the proposed method does not consider flow interference effects at fracture intersections wilson and witherspoon 1976 johnson et al 2006 when two crossed fractures have different apertures then the flow velocities through them are different the larger the velocity difference the more obvious the flow interference effect which can well explain the above result that the mean error rate tends to increase as the aperture ratio increases therefore it can be believed that with respect to a rock mass with different aperture fracture sets the computed errors are due to a the dfn model errors in udec and b flow interference effects at fracture intersections in addition the predicted and real values of aip for all groups are calculated according to eq 40 which are plotted in fig 19 the information in fig 19 shows that there are differences in aip between intersection angles of 30 degrees and 60 degrees and the differences decrease with increasing aperture ratio it seems that for a rock mass with two fracture sets the aip will increase as the intersection angle of the two sets increases and decrease as the aperture ratio of the two sets increases 7 discussion the predictive method of the permeability tensor is applicable only to a rock mass with a representative elementary volume rev because if the rev does not exist the ec model cannot be used to analyze the hydraulic behaviors of the rock mass therefore when using the proposed method the size of the analyzed rock mass should be not less than its rev the key step of the proposed determination method is to derive the theoretical relationship between the permeabilities in two different directions the theoretical derivation incorporates the variance in the discontinuity orientations and sizes of the fracture sets however the size parameter does not exist in the final formula which is one advantage over the classic oda models in addition the values of hydraulic apertures of the fracture sets are not required as input in the proposed formula only the aperture ratios of different fracture sets are required it should be noted that the values of the hydraulic aperture are extremely difficult to directly measure but their ratios can be estimated by their geometric apertures which are more easily sampled in the field this feature of the developed formula is another superiority over the classic oda models a value of the permeability in some direction is required in the proposed method a single well pumping test is suggested for determining the permeability in some direction this test is relatively cheap and easy to implement moreover the test result can reflect the comprehensive characteristics of a rock mass in some direction which involves the influence of in situ stress and filling material along with geometric parameters of fractures therefore the predictive results are likely to be better than those from existing methods only considering the geometric parameters of fractures considering that it is not easy to perform validation for 3 d complicated dfns the current method is developed in 2 d space however actual rock masses are in 3 d space and their hydraulic behaviors usually have obvious 3 d effects therefore the proposed method will be expanded to 3 d space in future research last but not least it should be noted that the proposed method is only validated by numerical modelling and need to be tested in practices 8 concluding remarks an analytical method is developed to determine the permeability tensor of fractured rock masses based on the orientation and linear frequency 1 d density of fractures along with a value of the permeability in any direction the key step of this method is to derive the theoretical relationship between the permeabilities in two different directions in contrast to the classic oda model oda 1985 the fracture size and hydraulic aperture do not need to be input into the developed formulas the orientation and linear frequency of fractures are usually the basic parameters of the investigations in rock engineering zheng et al 2018 2019 and can be easily sampled in practice the value of the permeability in some direction can be tested by a single well pumping test which is relatively cheap and easy to implement actually the proposed method can be regarded as a hybrid method of theoretical analysis and experiment in addition an anisotropy index of permeability aip is defined to quantitatively describe the permeability anisotropy to validate the method developed in this study some experiments were conducted with the udec the results show that the predicted values are very close to the real ones and the detailed results are as follows a for all cases of rock masses with equal aperture fracture sets the mean error rate of permeabilities in 23 different directions is approximately 10 7 1 13 4 whereas b for rock masses with different aperture fracture sets the mean error rate increases from 8 6 to 28 9 as the aperture ratio increases from 1 to 4 therefore the estimation method for directional permeability proposed in this study is valid especially for those rock masses in which the aperture ratios of the fracture sets are small e g less than 3 furthermore when using the proposed method the size of the analyzed rock mass should be not less than its rev in addition the current method is developed in 2 d space and will be expanded to 3 d space in future research credit authorship

5577,in arid agricultural areas with shallow water table depth water exchange between vadose zone and groundwater is intensive during the freezing thawing period and thus has a significant impact on crop growth this study is aimed to develop a one dimensional model that couples heat and variably saturated water in seasonally freezing thawing agricultural areas to alleviate numerical oscillations occurring during the phase change at zero temperature a three level iteration scheme was developed for solving the water and heat coupling model which improves numerical stability for variably saturated water and heat modeling the model accuracy was evaluated by comparing the simulation results with those from shaw under various soil texture and bottom conditions the square of correlation coefficient r 2 of freezing and thawing depth and soil temperature profiles are above 0 95 and the values of root mean square error rmse of total soil water content are lower than 0 05 cm3 cm3 which suggest the model accuracy the model was further applied to simulate the hydrothermal conditions in the yonglian irrigation field of hetao irrigation district in inner mongolia china model calibration and validation were conducted and the validated model was used to predict hydrothermal changes under scenarios with different soil surface temperatures and pre freezing water table depths the results show that the soil freezing process has great impact on the fluctuation of water table depth when the pre freezing water table depth is shallower than 180 cm the maximum freezing depth has a negative relation with the pre freezing water table depth when it is shallower than 180 cm an empirical formula was established to estimate the upward flow of groundwater to freezing soils the soil moisture and thermal conditions were analyzed in the germination and seedling stages after the freezing thawing period and the analysis leads to a recommended pre freezing water table depth of 100 cm which provides suitable soil moisture and thermal conditions for the crop growth keywords water and heat coupling model pre freezing water table depth shallow water table depth area upward flow of groundwater soil surface temperature 1 introduction soil water exchange between vadose zone and groundwater during freezing thawing periods is of significant importance to water resources management in agricultural areas with shallow water table depth ouyang et al 2015 it is well known that the mechanisms of soil water exchange during freezing thawing periods are different from those in other periods ireson et al 2013 in a freezing period subzero temperature at soil surface results in the formation of freezing front that progresses downward in soil with time sheshukov and nieber 2011 at and above the freezing front liquid water content and liquid water pressure are reduced which result in a large matric potential gradient from deep soil to the freezing front iwata et al 2010 as a result soil water moves upward to the frozen layer watanabe et al 2011 and water table drops accordingly in areas with shallow water table depth dai et al 2018 in a thawing period soil water from the frozen layer recharges groundwater which raises water table since the strong bidirectional exchange of soil water and groundwater happens in the freezing thawing period chen et al 2018 it is important to study the dynamics of the bidirectional exchanges between vadose zone and groundwater aquifer during the freezing thawing period especially in cold regions with shallow water table depth due to agricultural irrigation lysimeter experiments were usually used to measure the upward flow of groundwater to freezing soils with fixed water table dietrich et al 2016 lei et al 1999 miao et al 2017 however it is difficult to conduct field experiments to obtain temporal data of soil water and temperature during freezing thawing periods due to tough working conditions chang et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 numerical models have been vital tools for estimating soil moisture and temperature of freezing thawing periods and a number of models have been developed including coupmodel jansson and karlberg 2004 shaw flerchinger and saxton 1989 sutra ice mckenzie et al 2007 frostb berg et al 1980 extended hydrus with a freezing thawing module hansson et al 2004 and help3 schroeder et al 1994 these models have been widely used in predictions of near surface hydrological processes such as infiltration stahli et al 1999 snowmelt infiltration niemeyer et al 2016 unsaturated freezing thawing cycles and surface runoff lindström et al 2002 wu et al 2011 and climate change influence on soil hydrothermal dynamics and infiltration capacity hayashi 2013 zhang et al 2013 in particular shaw has been a popular modeling tool for agricultural areas roy 2014 applied shaw to estimate soil moisture variation under conventional tillage or no till management a coupled model rz shaw rzwqmshaw was developed to simulate crop root growth and it was used to estimate overwinter soil moisture and temperature with or without pre winter irrigation conditions flerchinger et al 2000 li et al 2012 currently most researches are focused on soil water and heat transport processes during the freezing thawing period within the depth of 0 1 0 m kojima et al 2013 the water and heat transport within 1 0 m soil layer were simulated by khoshkhoo et al 2015 and only the top soil within the depth of 0 4 m was considered in starkloff et al 2017 few numerical simulations have been conducted to quantify the relation between water table depth and soil freezing thawing processes alkhaier et al 2012 chen et al 2019 or to simulate groundwater dynamics during the freezing thawing period hansson and lundin 2006 wu et al 2018 the exchange of soil water and groundwater caused by freezing and thawing processes of soil and variation of water table are difficult to be simulated due to the highly nonlinearity of coupling water flow and heat transport equations dall amico et al 2011 in addition the unit gradient assefa and woodbury 2013 zhang et al 2017 or seepage boundary condition kurylyk et al 2014 is commonly applied on the bottom boundary to simulate downward groundwater recharge which limits the model applicability to the upward soil water migration under shallow water table depth during freezing thawing periods great efforts have been made to improve the numerical approaches for solving water flow and heat transport equations in variably saturated freezing soils dall amico et al 2010 ippisch 2001 gouttevin et al 2012 the damping factor is introduced to modify the newton method to improve convergence and stability by painter 2011 a splitting method with newton algorithm for decoupled solution was proposed by dall amico et al 2011 in which the richards equation is solved in the first half time step and the temperature is calculated with only the advection contribution and then the conduction flux is calculated to find the new temperature in the second half time step in the model developed by hansson et al 2004 and zhang et al 2007 the modified picard iteration scheme celia et al 1990 is used for water flow and heat transport equations the water flow equation is solved first and the calculated soil moisture is then used to solve the heat transport equation the convergence of the water flow equation is not ensured before interacting information with the heat transport equation for the shaw model the implicit finite difference method and newton iterative technique are used to solve the water flow and heat transport equations the matric potential is determined by temperature in the frozen soil while it is solved by water flow equation in the un frozen soil flerchinger 1987 the water flux would be overestimated at the freezing front in shallow water table areas with large matric potential gradient which would lead to large computational efforts and numerical instability zha et al 2017 in general the numerical stability of hydrothermal models for frozen soil still has a great challenge when applying them in areas with shallow water table depth there are many parameters used in the water and heat coupling models including the soil water hydraulic parameters and thermal hydraulic parameters wu et al 2011 a large number of parameters increase uncertainty of the water and heat coupling model wu 2016 to reduce the uncertainty caused by model parameters long term data are needed for model calibration and validation okkonen et al 2017 however hampered by a lack of data most coupled models were calibrated and verified by using a small amount of data obtained in one or two freezing thawing periods cheng et al 2014 yi et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 the data of 9 separate freezing thawing periods was used to calibrate and validate the hydraulic parameters of shaw li et al 2012 currently a continuous ten year soil moisture and temperature data in glacial till soils were used to validate parameters of coupmodel okkonen et al 2017 which demonstrates the possibility of the long term prediction of soil moisture however there have been few researches focusing on the soil water and temperature modeling both in the nonfreezing crop growing season and freezing thawing periods which is necessary for agricultural areas with seasonal freezing thawing period in this paper a one dimensional 1 d water and heat coupling model was developed and used to simulate the soil moisture and temperature dynamics as well as the water table depth during the freezing thawing period in agricultural areas a three level iteration scheme was proposed for hydrothermal coupling to improve the model stability and to alleviate mass imbalance caused by numerical oscillations synthetic examples were used to test the accuracy of the model by comparing the results with those obtained from shaw the model was then applied to a real world modeling at yonglian irrigation field in inner mongolia to investigate the relationship between the upward flow of groundwater to freezing soil and the accumulated negative soil surface temperature and the pre freezing water table depth the impacts of pre freezing water table depth on the soil moisture and heat were calculated to assess the reasonable pre freezing water table depth 2 model description 2 1

subsequently solves the heat transport equation a loop iteration is needed when considering the intrinsic integration of the two equations during the k th loop iteration eq 1 is iteratively solved to obtain the pressure head of iteration m at time step j 1 marked as hj 1 m k and then to obtain the liquid water content θl j 1 m k by the vg or bc model the convergence of the iteration is determined by examining the difference of pressure head between the present and the previous iterations the convergence criterion is set as 26 if max h j 1 m k h j 1 m 1 k ε h or max θ l j 1 m k θ l j 1 m 1 k ε θ where εh is a specified error tolerance of pressure head l and εθ is a specified error tolerance of liquid water content l3 l 3 the iteration continues to m 1 when the convergence criterion is not met otherwise the model proceeds to solve the heat transport equation at time step j 1 during the loop iteration k subsequently eq 3 is solved to obtain the temperature tj 1 r k of iteration r at time step j 1 if tj 1 r k is lower than zero the clausius clapeyron equation eq 4 is used to first update the pressure head and then to update the liquid water content θl j 1 r k and ice content θice j 1 r

time step 3 model evaluation and application two cases were considered to evaluate accuracy of the numerical scheme and applicability of the model to real world complicated problems case 1 including 12 different soil textures was designed to evaluate the model accuracy with homogeneous and heterogeneous unsaturated soils by comparing the results obtained from the 1d simultaneous heat and water model shaw under specified soil moisture or the unit gradient bottom boundary conditions case 2 was a real world application at the yonglian irrigation field to investigate the model suitability under complex field conditions with shallow water table depth after model calibration and validation 18 scenarios considering 3 kinds of soil surface temperature and 6 kinds of pre freezing water table depth were designed to estimate the upward flow of groundwater to freezing soils and to determine the pre freezing water table depth to satisfy the required soil moisture and thermal conditions for crop growth in spring of the next year the square of correlation coefficient r 2 root mean squared error rmse mean error me and relative mean absolute error rmae are used to quantitatively evaluate the misfit between the simulated results of the proposed model and the observations formulas for the four mentioned above error scores are shown in appendix c the results and discussion are presented in section 4 3 1 case1 synthetic case for model accuracy evaluation this case considered the vertical water flow and heat transport subject to various soils by comparing the results of the proposed model with those obtained by using shaw the soil column is 150 cm in length there are eight different soil types i e sand loamy sand loam silty loam sandy clay loam silty clay loam sandy clay and clay applied in the soil layer respectively considering the homogeneous soil the initial water content was set as 0 3 cm3 cm3 and constant water content 0 3 cm3 cm3 was set at the bottom of the column the bc model is used to describe the soil water properties which is consistent with shaw the particle distribution and the soil hydraulic parameters of the eight soil types given by rawls et al 1992 and campbell and norman 1998 are listed in table 1 and they are also used by shaw there are four heterogeneous soil profiles with different mixtures of sand loamy sand and silty clay loam which are marked as m1 m2 m3 and m4 the initial linear matric potential was set from top 100 cm to bottom 8 cm and the unit gradient boundary was set at the bottom the initial total water content and the soil texture of the four heterogeneous soils are shown in fig 2 for all the 12 homogeneous and heterogeneous soils in case 1 the initial soil temperature was set as 0 1 on the top of the soil column linearly increasing to 7 0 at the bottom of the soil column soil particles are taken as independent constituent that the default thermal conductivities of sand silt and clay are 8 8 w m 2 92 w m and 2 92 w m and relative shape factors are 0 144 0 144 and 0 125 the values of evaporation and soil surface temperature calculated by the surface energy balance of shaw was adopted as the upper boundary of the proposed model fig 3 shows the daily precipitation evaporation e p surface and bottom temperature imposing as the upper and bottom boundaries the simulation period lasts for 210 days 3 2 case2 real world application the hetao irrigation district is located in the west part of inner mongolia china where the freezing thawing period is about five month long from middle november to late april of the next year autumn irrigation takes place after harvest in september every year before the freezing period for washing soil salt out and keeping suitable soil thermal and moisture conditions for the farming of the next year due to no irrigation water diverting to the district in april li et al 2013 autumn irrigation consumes more than 30 of total irrigation water from the yellow river hao 2016 decreasing the autumn irrigation water is considered to be a possible way to conserve water resources given the regulation to decrease the diversion allocation from the yellow river to hetao irrigation district sun et al 2019 however decreasing the autumn irrigation water will impact the pre freezing water table depth and the water exchange of groundwater and vadose zone which may further lead to the unsuitable hydrothermal soil condition for crop growing in the next spring it is thus necessary to investigate practical water table depth before freezing for satisfying the required soil moisture and thermal conditions for farming the yonglian irrigation field 108 06 18 e 41 08 06 n is located in the middle of hetao irrigation district fig 4 it is 510 m long from north to south and 410 m wide from east to west fig 4 the study area is flat and the range of average slope is 1 25 1 00 there are 5 groundwater monitoring wells to observe water table depth named as a c e g and h shown in fig 4 there is a five month freezing thawing period from middle november to late april of the next year with no snow coverage the major crops in the irrigation area include maize sunflower and wheat the soil at the site is composed by sandy clay within the top depth of 50 cm and underlain by a loam layer with the thickness of 90 cm and below the depth of 140 cm loamy sand which is based on our field sampling work in 2017 the physical properties of the soil types are listed in table 2 the observed data of total soil water content including the ice and liquid water freezing and thawing depth and water table depth from 1994 to 1999 were used to calibrate the model parameters and those from 2012 to 2015 were for validation the parameters of soil water characteristics used by the vg model are calibrated including θr θs ks n and α which are residual water content saturated water content saturated hydraulic conductivity exponent and coefficient in the soil water retention function respectively these parameters are determined by soil types which is independent with time so it is reasonable to use history data from 1994 to 1999 for calibration in this area the average total soil water content at the depths of 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm soil temperature at the depths of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm and 80 cm and freezing and thawing depths from 1994 to 1999 were measured by yichang irrigation bureau the water table depth from 1994 to 1999 was obtained based on the two nearby monitoring wells 199 and 255 the total soil water content at the depths of 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm soil temperature at the depths of 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm and water table depth from 2012 to 2015 were measured by wu 2016 the total soil water content was spatial averaged on the data from the soil samples nearby the 5 monitoring wells the water table depth was the mean of 5 monitoring wells observed every 5 days the upper boundary information for the proposed model includes soil surface temperature precipitation evaporation ep and transpiration tp the former two are the observations from wuyuan weather station 108 16 e 41 16 n 1994 1999 and urad middle banner weather station 108 31 e 41 34 n 2012 2015 while the latter two are calculated from atmospheric information evaporation during the no crop season from october to may is calculated from 20 cm evaporation pan e 20 with monthly coefficients which is determined by e 20 from urad middle banner weather station during 2012 and 2013 and measured soil evaporation by wu et al 2016 in the crop growing season daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 is calculated from e 20 with monthly coefficients given by hao 2016 then the potential evapotranspiration etp is determined by et0 with crop coefficient of sunflower from yan 2008 the etp is partitioned into ep and tp with leaf area index lai of sunflower yan 2008 cheng 2017 the precipitation evaporation transpiration soil temperatures in the upper and bottom boundary for 1995 1999 and 2012 2015 are shown in fig 5 a and 5 b to compare model performance of the proposed model and shaw in this practical case the water and heat transport in freezing and thawing seasons from november to the next may during 2012 2015 was also simulated by shaw the soil water parameters of the two model are the same one difference of the two models is that the upper boundary of the heat and water is calculated by the daily weather data in shaw while it is as input data in the developed model the simulation during the crop growing season is not compared due to the significant difference of the two models to calculate the crop uptake which makes it hard to find benchmark for evaluation given the plan of water saving irrigation in hetao irrigation district the water table depth before soil freezing will be changed with different irrigation schemes the new practical pre freezing water table depth is needed to ensure suitable farming conditions of soil water and heat in the spring of next year the calibrated model was then used to simulate the soil water content and temperature under various pre freezing water table depth with different scenarios of soil surface temperature the simulation period is from october 20th to the next june 20th the evaporation ep and transpiration tp are calculated with the same method in the calibration and validation based on the mean daily values from 1990 to 2017 take maize as the planting crop which is seeded in mid april the crop coefficient and lai of maize are both from yan 2008 the growing season starts on 20th april six kinds of pre freezing water table depths h 0 are set as 50 cm 70 cm 100 cm 140 cm 180 cm and 220 cm the h 0 of 50 cm is the same as the current condition and the h 0 of 220 cm is the condition without autumn irrigation and others are between them three kinds of soil surface temperature are set for each pre freezing water table depth condition which are the soil temperature of typical year during the freezing thawing period with the minimum average and maximum annual temperature from 1990 to 2017 marked as st1 st2 and st3 there are total 18 scenarios in case 2 when comprehensively considering the pre freezing water table depth and soil surface temperature the precipitation evaporation transpiration boundary soil temperatures in scenario analysis are shown in fig 5 c and 5 d 4 results and discussion 4 1 numerical accuracy the simulated freezing and thawing depths profiles of total soil water content and temperature of case 1 at the 95 d by the proposed model are compared with those from shaw the comparison results of freezing and thawing depth for the 12 soils in case 1 are listed in fig 6 the r2 values of the thawing depth for both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios are above 0 98 the corresponding rmses from 1 82 cm to 4 86 cm mes from 1 3 cm to 2 37 cm and rmaes from 60 23 to 87 14 the r2 values of freezing depth are above 0 97 the corresponding rmses from 1 96 cm to 13 82 cm mes from 0 88 cm to 12 11 cm and rmaes from 3 55 to 22 80 the comparison results of soil temperature profile at the 95 d for the 12 soils in case 1 are shown in fig 7 the simulated temperatures of the proposed model coincide well with those of shaw all the r2 values are closed to 1 00 the relative rmses lower than 0 90 and rmaes from 7 13 to 54 46 the comparison results of total water content profile at the 95 d for the 12 soils in case 1 are shown in fig 8 although relative lower r2 values ranging from 0 62 to 0 90 are observed for those homogeneous soil scenarios the rmse values range from 0 02 cm3 cm3 to 0 05 cm3 cm3 mes from 0 cm3 cm3 to 0 01 cm3 cm3 and rmaes from 4 14 to 56 12 the r2 values for those heterogeneous soils are all above 0 99 and the rmse values lower than 0 02 cm3 cm3 and me values equal to 0 00 cm3 cm3 and rmaes from 1 82 to 6 67 those mentioned results demonstrate good performance of the proposed model to simulate the water and heat transport during the freezing thawing period 4 2 model calibration and validation in real world application fig 9 shows the comparison results of the simulated and observed water table depth freezing and thawing depth soil temperature and total soil water content at different depths in the calibration and validation of case 2 and the error scores r2 rmse me rmae of the simulation results are listed in table 4 the r2 values of water table depth in the calibration and validation are 0 84 and 0 89 the rmses 25 74 cm and 31 44 cm mes 3 46 cm and 2 19 cm and rmaes 24 07 and 68 32 since there are no measured freezing and thawing depths in the validation period only the results in the calibration period are shown in fig 9 b the r2 values of freezing and thawing depth are above 0 90 and the rmses of freezing and thawing depth are 31 59 cm and 6 60 cm the relative large deviations between the simulated and observed freezing depth could be caused by the hysteresis effect of soil freezing the hysteresis effect on soil freezing is that there is a difference between the freezing characteristic and the thawing characteristic for the same subzero temperature wang et al 2018 the liquid water content in cooling process is higher than that in warming process when the temperature is close to freezing points bittelli et al 2003 tian et al 2014 the proposed model cannot consider the hysteresis effect of soil freezing which would overestimate the ice content in cooling process this could cause a deeper freezing depth by the proposed model than observations the simulated and observed daily soil temperature at the depths of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm and 80 cm are shown in fig 9 c fig 9 f the r2 values of soil temperature at different depths in the calibration and validation are all above 0 91 all the responding rmse values are lower than 3 7 me values from 1 60 to 1 22 and rmaes from15 83 to 204 15 the large rmaes are caused by that there are not enough measured temperature data used and the average measured temperature are closed to zero the simulated and measured total soil water content at the depths of 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm are shown in fig 9 g fig 9 j the r 2 values of total soil water content range from 0 40 to 0 48 in the calibration and from 0 45 to 0 66 in the validation the responding rmse values range from 0 08 cm3 cm3 to 0 16 cm3 cm3 and rmaes from 14 28 to 28 91 the reason for the relative worse results is that the soil water content in the freezing thawing period exceeds the saturated water content which even reaches 0 84 cm3 cm3 at 10 cm on november 26th in 1994 the proposed model fails to capture the high total soil water content near the soil surface which surpasses the saturated water content the reason causing the high measured soil water content is that the soil is ploughed before autumn irrigation and leveled off before sowing miao et al 2015 lu et al 2019 which changes the soil structure before soil freezing frost heaving can also lead to the total soil water content exceeding the saturated water content in this shallow groundwater table area without considering the frost heaving and soil structure changed by tillage the total soil water content is limited by the saturated water content in the proposed model at present this should be improved in latter research work in general the proposed model can characterize water and heat transport in unsaturated saturated soil for long term simulation the calibrated hydraulic parameters are listed in table 2 4 3 model performance comparison with shaw in case 2 the water mass balance errors of the proposed model and shaw in freezing and thawing seasons of case 2 are shown in table 3 it can be found that the proposed model owns much smaller mass balance error than those of shaw the mass balance errors of the developed model are all in the magnitude of 10 4 while those of shaw fluctuate by three orders of magnitude from 10 1 to 10 4 the error scores r2 rmse me rmae of the proposed model and shaw in freezing and thawing seasons during 2012 and 2015 in case 2 are listed in table 4 shaw model obtains the better results in soil temperature than the proposed model while the error scores of the proposed model for water table depth and total soil water content are better than those of shaw when considering the rmse and rmae it should be mentioned that different ways are used to obtain the upper thermal boundary conditions by the two models the observed soil temperature of ground surface is used directly as upper boundary condition in the proposed model while it is calculated by the surface energy balance module in shaw therefore only three input items precipitation evaporation and soil temperature during the freezing and thawing season are needed for the proposed model while five input items maximum and minimum air temperature dew point temperature average wind speed precipitation and solar radiation are needed in shaw the proposed model is more convenient for users with limited data in cold and semi arid areas it should be noted that the proposed model cannot consider the snowmelt water which is not suitable for areas with heavy snow in the winter season 4 4 variations of water table depth and freezing and thawing depth under prediction scenarios the variations of water table depth freezing and thawing depth with different pre freezing water table depth h0 under various soil surface temperature scenarios are shown in fig 10 it can be found that the relative lower soil surface temperature st1 results in deeper freezing depth under the same pre freezing water table depth this is consistent with the founding that the freezing depth is positive correlated with the accumulated negative temperature during the freezing season niu et al 2017 frauenfeld et al 2007 fig 10 a f show that the lower pre freezing water table depth results in deeper freezing depth within a certain critical depth 180 cm the freezing depths are 137 cm 130 cm 122 cm 115 cm and 110 cm with the pre freezing water table depth of 50 cm 70 cm 100 cm 140 cm and 180 cm under st2 however the freezing depth increases with the increase of pre freezing water table depth when it is larger than 180 cm the freezing depth is 115 cm when h0 is 220 cm this is consistent to the results found by chen et al 2019 in which the maximum freezing depths under the pre freezing water table depth of 100 cm and 200 cm are larger than that of 150 cm the reason is that the heat transport in freezing soils is governed by heat capacity heat conductivity and latent heat shallower pre freezing water table depth means higher soil ice content which results in a much higher heat conductivity and speeds up the thermal propagation in frozen soils this causes the increase of maximum freezing depth with the decrease of the pre freezing water table depth however the soil capacity will decrease when the pre freezing water table depth is deeper than a certain value 180 cm in the study area which is also beneficial for the thermal propagation and results in the increase of the freezing depth thus the simulated freezing depth variation trend is reasonable fig 10 g l show that the increase of water table depth during the freezing thawing period declines with the increase of h 0 when h 0 increases to 180 cm very slight change of water table depth is observed which demonstrates that the soil freezing process does not influence the groundwater below 180 cm in this area to evaluate the reliability of the simulations the observed water table depth during the freezing thawing period under different pre freezing water table depths 50 cm 70 cm 100 cm 140 cm are also shown in fig 10 g j these observations are obtained from the yonglian irrigation field and other sites named as 182 165 and 179 in hetao irrigation district with the same soil texture to the study area although the observed and simulated water table depth shows obvious deviations very similar variation trends can be found between the observations and simulations under the same pre freezing water table depth conditions which shows the reliability of the model results in general it can also be found in fig 10 that the change of water table depth is highly correlated with the change of freezing and thawing depth during the soil freezing period the water table depth increases which is caused by the upward migration of water to freezing soils during the soil thawing period the water table depth decreases which is caused by part of melting water moving from frozen zone to groundwater by gravity 4 5 upward flow of groundwater to the freezing soil the upward flow of groundwater to the freezing soil in this paper is defined as the decline of water storage of groundwater zone under the pre freezing water table depth which is calculated by the water mass balance of groundwater zone as mentioned above soil freezing process has significant influence on the water table depth and upward flow of groundwater changes along water table dynamics the simulated upward flow of groundwater under different pre freezing water table depth and soil surface temperature are shown in fig 11 it should be noted that the relationship between the upward flow of groundwater and the accumulated negative soil surface temperature shown in fig 11 is based on ignoring the impact of snowpack and without other hydraulic processes changing the groundwater dynamics e g lateral groundwater flow it can be found that the maximum upward flow of groundwater simulated by the proposed model is 3 53 cm when h 0 value is 50 cm to evaluate the accuracy of simulation results the measured maximum upward flow of groundwater during the freezing period of 2017 to 2018 nearby the five monitoring wells a c e g and h with the pre freezing depth of 50 cm are calculated which are 4 51 cm 5 4 cm 3 24 cm 3 57 cm 7 61 cm and the average value is 4 87 cm although the measured values fluctuate strongly the simulated value is consistent with most measured ones which shows that the simulated result is reasonable furthermore the relationship between the maximum upward flow of groundwater with the pre freezing water table depth obtained by the proposed model is analyzed as showed in fig 12 a it can be found that the maximum upward flow of groundwater has a slight increase trend when h 0 is shallower than 100 cm and then decreases obviously with the increase of h 0 this variation trend is similar to the observations of lysimeter tests obtained by chen et al 2018 as shown in fig 12 b although the water table depth was fixed during the experiments of chen et al 2018 while it varied in the simulation the maximum upward flow of groundwater happened under the water table depth of 100 cm and then decreases with the increase of the water table depth as shown in fig 12 b the reason is that there is smaller unsaturated soil zone to store upward water with shallower pre freezing water table which results in the increase of upward flow of groundwater along the increase of pre freezing water table depth at a certain critical value which is 100 cm in the simulation and in the experiments of chen et al 2018 as shown in fig 12 this critical value of pre freezing water table depth 100 cm could be different in other locations with specific soil characteristics and hydrothermal conditions however the distance of freezing front and groundwater table becomes too large to decline the matric potential gradient when the pre freezing water table depth becomes deeper than the critical value which will decrease the ability of upward water migration induced by freezing process thus the simulation results show in fig 12 a are reasonable since it is difficult to measure the upward flow of groundwater during the freezing period a simple formula representing the upward flow of groundwater to vadose zone in the freezing period is developed the relationship between the upward flow of groundwater and the accumulated negative soil surface temperature is developed by fitting the simulations as the following formula 29 y 0 t s b a t s b b t s c y max t s c where y is the upward flow of groundwater in the freezing period cm ts is the accumulated negative soil surface temperature d a cm d and c d are the empirical parameters b d is the minimum accumulated negative temperature causing upward migration of groundwater ymax cm is the maximum amount of upward flow of groundwater to freezing soils the fitting curves and the resulting regression equations as well as the model evaluation criterion are shown in fig 11 since the upward flow of groundwater is 0 when h0 is 220 cm there are only 5 fitting curves with the pre freezing water table depth of 50 cm 70 cm 100 cm 140 cm and 180 cm the r2 values are all above 0 85 and the corresponding rmses are all lower than 0 5 cm the empirical parameter a is significantly impacted by the pre freezing water table depth as shown in fig 13 it can be found that a has an exponential relationship with the pre freezing water table depth and the r2 value is 0 94 thus eq 29 can be further rewritten as 30 y 0 t s

period 4 6 rational pre freezing water table depth rational pre freezing water table depth is important to ensure the suitable soil thermal and moisture conditions for crop growth after the freezing thawing period in this study sowing is assumed to happen on april 10th and the germination stage lasts 10 days after sowing the seeding depth is 5 cm and the lowest temperature of seed germination for maize is 10 sánchez et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the suitable soil moisture at this stage are set from 0 21 to 0 27 cm3 cm3 hou et al 2007 the seedling period is from april 20th to may 30th the soil temperatures and total soil water contents at the depth of 5 cm with various pre freezing water table depth and soil surface temperature scenarios are shown in fig 14 the soil surface temperature owns more important influence on the soil temperature the soil temperatures can satisfy the required thermal condition of 10 for the germination stage under most scenarios of pre freezing water table depth with st3 while it is lower than 10 with st1 the pre freezing water table depth has greater influence on the soil moisture it can ensure that the soil moisture ranges from 0 21 cm3 cm3 to 0 27 cm3 cm3 when the pre freezing water table depth ranges between 100 cm and 140 cm the soil moisture is lower than 0 21 cm3 cm3 when the pre freezing water table depth is larger than 140 cm the lower pre freezing water table depth than 100 cm results in soil moisture larger than 0 27 cm3 cm3 during the seedling period the potential accumulated root uptake amount until may 31th is 2 26 cm the actual accumulated root uptake amount on 31th may under different scenarios are shown in fig 15 it is found that the soil surface temperature has very small influence on the actual accumulated root uptake amount under the same pre freezing water table depth while the pre freezing water table depth impacts the actual accumulated root uptake amount significantly the actual accumulated amount of root uptake decreases from 2 22 cm to 1 57 cm along with the increase of the pre freezing water table depth under the st2 the actual accumulated root uptake amount is larger than 80 of the potential one when the pre freezing water table is lower than 140 cm which would not harm the crop growing kiziloglu et al 2009 in general by comprehensive considering the soil thermal and moisture conditions the rational pre freezing water table depth is 100 cm 5 conclusions a one dimensional water and heat coupled model was developed and applied to figure out the influence of soil freezing processes on the upward flow of groundwater to the vadose zone the model accuracy was evaluated by comparing the results with those obtained by shaw the model was applied to analyze dynamics of soil water content soil temperature and upward flow of groundwater to freezing soils in yonglian irrigation field of heato irrigation district the major conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the proposed model with three level iteration scheme can capture the characteristics of soil moisture soil temperature and water table depth accurately in the freezing thawing period with complex soil texture and boundary conditions the model performances well in keeping water mass balance in the simulation 2 the subzero soil surface temperature and pre freezing water table depth are the two factors to influence the water table depth in the freezing period in the study area the deepest impact depth of soil frozen process is 180 cm in the study area 3 the pre freezing water table depth also effects the soil freezing process the maximum freezing depth has a negative relation with the pre freezing water table depth when it is shallower than 180 cm 4 an empirical formula is developed to calculate the upward flow of groundwater to freezing soils which can be estimated by the accumulated negative soil surface temperature and pre freezing water table depth 5 to ensure the suitable soil thermal and moisture conditions for crop germination and seedling the rational pre freezing water table depth is 100 cm in the study area 6 the model fails to capture the soil water content when it exceeds the saturated water content in the

5577,in arid agricultural areas with shallow water table depth water exchange between vadose zone and groundwater is intensive during the freezing thawing period and thus has a significant impact on crop growth this study is aimed to develop a one dimensional model that couples heat and variably saturated water in seasonally freezing thawing agricultural areas to alleviate numerical oscillations occurring during the phase change at zero temperature a three level iteration scheme was developed for solving the water and heat coupling model which improves numerical stability for variably saturated water and heat modeling the model accuracy was evaluated by comparing the simulation results with those from shaw under various soil texture and bottom conditions the square of correlation coefficient r 2 of freezing and thawing depth and soil temperature profiles are above 0 95 and the values of root mean square error rmse of total soil water content are lower than 0 05 cm3 cm3 which suggest the model accuracy the model was further applied to simulate the hydrothermal conditions in the yonglian irrigation field of hetao irrigation district in inner mongolia china model calibration and validation were conducted and the validated model was used to predict hydrothermal changes under scenarios with different soil surface temperatures and pre freezing water table depths the results show that the soil freezing process has great impact on the fluctuation of water table depth when the pre freezing water table depth is shallower than 180 cm the maximum freezing depth has a negative relation with the pre freezing water table depth when it is shallower than 180 cm an empirical formula was established to estimate the upward flow of groundwater to freezing soils the soil moisture and thermal conditions were analyzed in the germination and seedling stages after the freezing thawing period and the analysis leads to a recommended pre freezing water table depth of 100 cm which provides suitable soil moisture and thermal conditions for the crop growth keywords water and heat coupling model pre freezing water table depth shallow water table depth area upward flow of groundwater soil surface temperature 1 introduction soil water exchange between vadose zone and groundwater during freezing thawing periods is of significant importance to water resources management in agricultural areas with shallow water table depth ouyang et al 2015 it is well known that the mechanisms of soil water exchange during freezing thawing periods are different from those in other periods ireson et al 2013 in a freezing period subzero temperature at soil surface results in the formation of freezing front that progresses downward in soil with time sheshukov and nieber 2011 at and above the freezing front liquid water content and liquid water pressure are reduced which result in a large matric potential gradient from deep soil to the freezing front iwata et al 2010 as a result soil water moves upward to the frozen layer watanabe et al 2011 and water table drops accordingly in areas with shallow water table depth dai et al 2018 in a thawing period soil water from the frozen layer recharges groundwater which raises water table since the strong bidirectional exchange of soil water and groundwater happens in the freezing thawing period chen et al 2018 it is important to study the dynamics of the bidirectional exchanges between vadose zone and groundwater aquifer during the freezing thawing period especially in cold regions with shallow water table depth due to agricultural irrigation lysimeter experiments were usually used to measure the upward flow of groundwater to freezing soils with fixed water table dietrich et al 2016 lei et al 1999 miao et al 2017 however it is difficult to conduct field experiments to obtain temporal data of soil water and temperature during freezing thawing periods due to tough working conditions chang et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 numerical models have been vital tools for estimating soil moisture and temperature of freezing thawing periods and a number of models have been developed including coupmodel jansson and karlberg 2004 shaw flerchinger and saxton 1989 sutra ice mckenzie et al 2007 frostb berg et al 1980 extended hydrus with a freezing thawing module hansson et al 2004 and help3 schroeder et al 1994 these models have been widely used in predictions of near surface hydrological processes such as infiltration stahli et al 1999 snowmelt infiltration niemeyer et al 2016 unsaturated freezing thawing cycles and surface runoff lindström et al 2002 wu et al 2011 and climate change influence on soil hydrothermal dynamics and infiltration capacity hayashi 2013 zhang et al 2013 in particular shaw has been a popular modeling tool for agricultural areas roy 2014 applied shaw to estimate soil moisture variation under conventional tillage or no till management a coupled model rz shaw rzwqmshaw was developed to simulate crop root growth and it was used to estimate overwinter soil moisture and temperature with or without pre winter irrigation conditions flerchinger et al 2000 li et al 2012 currently most researches are focused on soil water and heat transport processes during the freezing thawing period within the depth of 0 1 0 m kojima et al 2013 the water and heat transport within 1 0 m soil layer were simulated by khoshkhoo et al 2015 and only the top soil within the depth of 0 4 m was considered in starkloff et al 2017 few numerical simulations have been conducted to quantify the relation between water table depth and soil freezing thawing processes alkhaier et al 2012 chen et al 2019 or to simulate groundwater dynamics during the freezing thawing period hansson and lundin 2006 wu et al 2018 the exchange of soil water and groundwater caused by freezing and thawing processes of soil and variation of water table are difficult to be simulated due to the highly nonlinearity of coupling water flow and heat transport equations dall amico et al 2011 in addition the unit gradient assefa and woodbury 2013 zhang et al 2017 or seepage boundary condition kurylyk et al 2014 is commonly applied on the bottom boundary to simulate downward groundwater recharge which limits the model applicability to the upward soil water migration under shallow water table depth during freezing thawing periods great efforts have been made to improve the numerical approaches for solving water flow and heat transport equations in variably saturated freezing soils dall amico et al 2010 ippisch 2001 gouttevin et al 2012 the damping factor is introduced to modify the newton method to improve convergence and stability by painter 2011 a splitting method with newton algorithm for decoupled solution was proposed by dall amico et al 2011 in which the richards equation is solved in the first half time step and the temperature is calculated with only the advection contribution and then the conduction flux is calculated to find the new temperature in the second half time step in the model developed by hansson et al 2004 and zhang et al 2007 the modified picard iteration scheme celia et al 1990 is used for water flow and heat transport equations the water flow equation is solved first and the calculated soil moisture is then used to solve the heat transport equation the convergence of the water flow equation is not ensured before interacting information with the heat transport equation for the shaw model the implicit finite difference method and newton iterative technique are used to solve the water flow and heat transport equations the matric potential is determined by temperature in the frozen soil while it is solved by water flow equation in the un frozen soil flerchinger 1987 the water flux would be overestimated at the freezing front in shallow water table areas with large matric potential gradient which would lead to large computational efforts and numerical instability zha et al 2017 in general the numerical stability of hydrothermal models for frozen soil still has a great challenge when applying them in areas with shallow water table depth there are many parameters used in the water and heat coupling models including the soil water hydraulic parameters and thermal hydraulic parameters wu et al 2011 a large number of parameters increase uncertainty of the water and heat coupling model wu 2016 to reduce the uncertainty caused by model parameters long term data are needed for model calibration and validation okkonen et al 2017 however hampered by a lack of data most coupled models were calibrated and verified by using a small amount of data obtained in one or two freezing thawing periods cheng et al 2014 yi et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 the data of 9 separate freezing thawing periods was used to calibrate and validate the hydraulic parameters of shaw li et al 2012 currently a continuous ten year soil moisture and temperature data in glacial till soils were used to validate parameters of coupmodel okkonen et al 2017 which demonstrates the possibility of the long term prediction of soil moisture however there have been few researches focusing on the soil water and temperature modeling both in the nonfreezing crop growing season and freezing thawing periods which is necessary for agricultural areas with seasonal freezing thawing period in this paper a one dimensional 1 d water and heat coupling model was developed and used to simulate the soil moisture and temperature dynamics as well as the water table depth during the freezing thawing period in agricultural areas a three level iteration scheme was proposed for hydrothermal coupling to improve the model stability and to alleviate mass imbalance caused by numerical oscillations synthetic examples were used to test the accuracy of the model by comparing the results with those obtained from shaw the model was then applied to a real world modeling at yonglian irrigation field in inner mongolia to investigate the relationship between the upward flow of groundwater to freezing soil and the accumulated negative soil surface temperature and the pre freezing water table depth the impacts of pre freezing water table depth on the soil moisture and heat were calculated to assess the reasonable pre freezing water table depth 2 model description 2 1

as m1 m2 m3 and m4 the initial linear matric potential was set from top 100 cm to bottom 8 cm and the unit gradient boundary was set at the bottom the initial total water content and the soil texture of the four heterogeneous soils are shown in fig 2 for all the 12 homogeneous and heterogeneous soils in case 1 the initial soil temperature was set as 0 1 on the top of the soil column linearly increasing to 7 0 at the bottom of the soil column soil particles are taken as independent constituent that the default thermal conductivities of sand silt and clay are 8 8 w m 2 92 w m and 2 92 w m and relative shape factors are 0 144 0 144 and 0 125 the values of evaporation and soil surface temperature calculated by the surface energy balance of shaw was adopted as the upper boundary of the proposed model fig 3 shows the daily precipitation evaporation e p surface and bottom temperature imposing as the upper and bottom boundaries the simulation period lasts for 210 days 3 2 case2 real world application the hetao irrigation district is located in the west part of inner mongolia china where the freezing thawing period is about five month long from middle november to late april of the next year autumn irrigation takes place after harvest in september every year before the freezing period for washing soil salt out and keeping suitable soil thermal and moisture conditions for the farming of the next year due to no irrigation water diverting to the district in april li et al 2013 autumn irrigation consumes more than 30 of total irrigation water from the yellow river hao 2016 decreasing the autumn irrigation water is considered to be a possible way to conserve water resources given the regulation to decrease the diversion allocation from the yellow river to hetao irrigation district sun et al 2019 however decreasing the autumn irrigation water will impact the pre freezing water table depth and the water exchange of groundwater and vadose zone which may further lead to the unsuitable hydrothermal soil condition for crop growing in the next spring it is thus necessary to investigate practical water table depth before freezing for satisfying the required soil moisture and thermal conditions for farming the yonglian irrigation field 108 06 18 e 41 08 06 n is located in the middle of hetao irrigation district fig 4 it is 510 m long from north to south and 410 m wide from east to west fig 4 the study area is flat and the range of average slope is 1 25 1 00 there are 5 groundwater monitoring wells to observe water table depth named as a c e g and h shown in fig 4 there is a five month freezing thawing period from middle november to late april of the next year with no snow coverage the major crops in the irrigation area include maize sunflower and wheat the soil at the site is composed by sandy clay within the top depth of 50 cm and underlain by a loam layer with the thickness of 90 cm and below the depth of 140 cm loamy sand which is based on our field sampling work in 2017 the physical properties of the soil types are listed in table 2 the observed data of total soil water content including the ice and liquid water freezing and thawing depth and water table depth from 1994 to 1999 were used to calibrate the model parameters and those from 2012 to 2015 were for validation the parameters of soil water characteristics used by the vg model are calibrated including θr θs ks n and α which are residual water content saturated water content saturated hydraulic conductivity exponent and coefficient in the soil water retention function respectively these parameters are determined by soil types which is independent with time so it is reasonable to use history data from 1994 to 1999 for calibration in this area the average total soil water content at the depths of 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm soil temperature at the depths of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm and 80 cm and freezing and thawing depths from 1994 to 1999 were measured by yichang irrigation bureau the water table depth from 1994 to 1999 was obtained based on the two nearby monitoring wells 199 and 255 the total soil water content at the depths of 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm soil temperature at the depths of 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm and water table depth from 2012 to 2015 were measured by wu 2016 the total soil water content was spatial averaged on the data from the soil samples nearby the 5 monitoring wells the water table depth was the mean of 5 monitoring wells observed every 5 days the upper boundary information for the proposed model includes soil surface temperature precipitation evaporation ep and transpiration tp the former two are the observations from wuyuan weather station 108 16 e 41 16 n 1994 1999 and urad middle banner weather station 108 31 e 41 34 n 2012 2015 while the latter two are calculated from atmospheric information evaporation during the no crop season from october to may is calculated from 20 cm evaporation pan e 20 with monthly coefficients which is determined by e 20 from urad middle banner weather station during 2012 and 2013 and measured soil evaporation by wu et al 2016 in the crop growing season daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 is calculated from e 20 with monthly coefficients given by hao 2016 then the potential evapotranspiration etp is determined by et0 with crop coefficient of sunflower from yan 2008 the etp is partitioned into ep and tp with leaf area index lai of sunflower yan 2008 cheng 2017 the precipitation evaporation transpiration soil temperatures in the upper and bottom boundary for 1995 1999 and 2012 2015 are shown in fig 5 a and 5 b to compare model performance of the proposed model and shaw in this practical case the water and heat transport in freezing and thawing seasons from november to the next may during 2012 2015 was also simulated by shaw the soil water parameters of the two model are the same one difference of the two models is that the upper boundary of the heat and water is calculated by the daily weather data in shaw while it is as input data in the developed model the simulation during the crop growing season is not compared due to the significant difference of the two models to calculate the crop uptake which makes it hard to find benchmark for evaluation given the plan of water saving irrigation in hetao irrigation district the water table depth before soil freezing will be changed with different irrigation schemes the new practical pre freezing water table depth is needed to ensure suitable farming conditions of soil water and heat in the spring of next year the calibrated model was then used to simulate the soil water content and temperature under various pre freezing water table depth with different scenarios of soil surface temperature the simulation period is from october 20th to the next june 20th the evaporation ep and transpiration tp are calculated with the same method in the calibration and validation based on the mean daily values from 1990 to 2017 take maize as the planting crop which is seeded in mid april the crop coefficient and lai of maize are both from yan 2008 the growing season starts on 20th april six kinds of pre freezing water table depths h 0 are set as 50 cm 70 cm 100 cm 140 cm 180 cm and 220 cm the h 0 of 50 cm is the same as the current condition and the h 0 of 220 cm is the condition without autumn irrigation and others are between them three kinds of soil surface temperature are set for each pre freezing water table depth condition which are the soil temperature of typical year during the freezing thawing period with the minimum average and maximum annual temperature from 1990 to 2017 marked as st1 st2 and st3 there are total 18 scenarios in case 2 when comprehensively considering the pre freezing water table depth and soil surface temperature the precipitation evaporation transpiration boundary soil temperatures in scenario analysis are shown in fig 5 c and 5 d 4 results and discussion 4 1 numerical accuracy the simulated freezing and thawing depths profiles of total soil water content and temperature of case 1 at the 95 d by the proposed model are compared with those from shaw the comparison results of freezing and thawing depth for the 12 soils in case 1 are listed in fig 6 the r2 values of the thawing depth for both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios are above 0 98 the corresponding rmses from 1 82 cm to 4 86 cm mes from 1 3 cm to 2 37 cm and rmaes from 60 23 to 87 14 the r2 values of freezing depth are above 0 97 the corresponding rmses from 1 96 cm to 13 82 cm mes from 0 88 cm to 12 11 cm and rmaes from 3 55 to 22 80 the comparison results of soil temperature profile at the 95 d for the 12 soils in case 1 are shown in fig 7 the simulated temperatures of the proposed model coincide well with those of shaw all the r2 values are closed to 1 00 the relative rmses lower than 0 90 and rmaes from 7 13 to 54 46 the comparison results of total water content profile at the 95 d for the 12 soils in case 1 are shown in fig 8 although relative lower r2 values ranging from 0 62 to 0 90 are observed for those homogeneous soil scenarios the rmse values range from 0 02 cm3 cm3 to 0 05 cm3 cm3 mes from 0 cm3 cm3 to 0 01 cm3 cm3 and rmaes from 4 14 to 56 12 the r2 values for those heterogeneous soils are all above 0 99 and the rmse values lower than 0 02 cm3 cm3 and me values equal to 0 00 cm3 cm3 and rmaes from 1 82 to 6 67 those mentioned results demonstrate good performance of the proposed model to simulate the water and heat transport during the freezing thawing period 4 2 model calibration and validation in real world application fig 9 shows the comparison results of the simulated and observed water table depth freezing and thawing depth soil temperature and total soil water content at different depths in the calibration and validation of case 2 and the error scores r2 rmse me rmae of the simulation results are listed in table 4 the r2 values of water table depth in the calibration and validation are 0 84 and 0 89 the rmses 25 74 cm and 31 44 cm mes 3 46 cm and 2 19 cm and rmaes 24 07 and 68 32 since there are no measured freezing and thawing depths in the validation period only the results in the calibration period are shown in fig 9 b the r2 values of freezing and thawing depth are above 0 90 and the rmses of freezing and thawing depth are 31 59 cm and 6 60 cm the relative large deviations between the simulated and observed freezing depth could be caused by the hysteresis effect of soil freezing the hysteresis effect on soil freezing is that there is a difference between the freezing characteristic and the thawing characteristic for the same subzero temperature wang et al 2018 the liquid water content in cooling process is higher than that in warming process when the temperature is close to freezing points bittelli et al 2003 tian et al 2014 the proposed model cannot consider the hysteresis effect of soil freezing which would overestimate the ice content in cooling process this could cause a deeper freezing depth by the proposed model than observations the simulated and observed daily soil temperature at the depths of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm and 80 cm are shown in fig 9 c fig 9 f the r2 values of soil temperature at different depths in the calibration and validation are all above 0 91 all the responding rmse values are lower than 3 7 me values from 1 60 to 1 22 and rmaes from15 83 to 204 15 the large rmaes are caused by that there are not enough measured temperature data used and the average measured temperature are closed to zero the simulated and measured total soil water content at the depths of 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm are shown in fig 9 g fig 9 j the r 2 values of total soil water content range from 0 40 to 0 48 in the calibration and from 0 45 to 0 66 in the validation the responding rmse values range from 0 08 cm3 cm3 to 0 16 cm3 cm3 and rmaes from 14 28 to 28 91 the reason for the relative worse results is that the soil water content in the freezing thawing period exceeds the saturated water content which even reaches 0 84 cm3 cm3 at 10 cm on november 26th in 1994 the proposed model fails to capture the high total soil water content near the soil surface which surpasses the saturated water content the reason causing the high measured soil water content is that the soil is ploughed before autumn irrigation and leveled off before sowing miao et al 2015 lu et al 2019 which changes the soil structure before soil freezing frost heaving can also lead to the total soil water content exceeding the saturated water content in this shallow groundwater table area without considering the frost heaving and soil structure changed by tillage the total soil water content is limited by the saturated water content in the proposed model at present this should be improved in latter research work in general the proposed model can characterize water and heat transport in unsaturated saturated soil for long term simulation the calibrated hydraulic parameters are listed in table 2 4 3 model performance comparison with shaw in case 2 the water mass balance errors of the proposed model and shaw in freezing and thawing seasons of case 2 are shown in table 3 it can be found that the proposed model owns much smaller mass balance error than those of shaw the mass balance errors of the developed model are all in the magnitude of 10 4 while those of shaw fluctuate by three orders of magnitude from 10 1 to 10 4 the error scores r2 rmse me rmae of the proposed model and shaw in freezing and thawing seasons during 2012 and 2015 in case 2 are listed in table 4 shaw model obtains the better results in soil temperature than the proposed model while the error scores of the proposed model for water table depth and total soil water content are better than those of shaw when considering the rmse and rmae it should be mentioned that different ways are used to obtain the upper thermal boundary conditions by the two models the observed soil temperature of ground surface is used directly as upper boundary condition in the proposed model while it is calculated by the surface energy balance module in shaw therefore only three input items precipitation evaporation and soil temperature during the freezing and thawing season are needed for the proposed model while five input items maximum and minimum air temperature dew point temperature average wind speed precipitation and solar radiation are needed in shaw the proposed model is more convenient for users with limited data in cold and semi arid areas it should be noted that the proposed model cannot consider the snowmelt water which is not suitable for areas with heavy snow in the winter season 4 4 variations of water table depth and freezing and thawing depth under prediction scenarios the variations of water table depth freezing and thawing depth with different pre freezing water table depth h0 under various soil surface temperature scenarios are shown in fig 10 it can be found that the relative lower soil surface temperature st1 results in deeper freezing depth under the same pre freezing water table depth this is consistent with the founding that the freezing depth is positive correlated with the accumulated negative temperature during the freezing season niu et al 2017 frauenfeld et al 2007 fig 10 a f show that the lower pre freezing water table depth results in deeper freezing depth within a certain critical depth 180 cm the freezing depths are 137 cm 130 cm 122 cm 115 cm and 110 cm with the pre freezing water table depth of 50 cm 70 cm 100 cm 140 cm and 180 cm under st2 however the freezing depth increases with the increase of pre freezing water table depth when it is larger than 180 cm the freezing depth is 115 cm when h0 is 220 cm this is consistent to the results found by chen et al 2019 in which the maximum freezing depths under the pre freezing water table depth of 100 cm and 200 cm are larger than that of 150 cm the reason is that the heat transport in freezing soils is governed by heat capacity heat conductivity and latent heat shallower pre freezing water table depth means higher soil ice content which results in a much higher heat conductivity and speeds up the thermal propagation in frozen soils this causes the increase of maximum freezing depth with the decrease of the pre freezing water table depth however the soil capacity will decrease when the pre freezing water table depth is deeper than a certain value 180 cm in the study area which is also beneficial for the thermal propagation and results in the increase of the freezing depth thus the simulated freezing depth variation trend is reasonable fig 10 g l show that the increase of water table depth during the freezing thawing period declines with the increase of h 0 when h 0 increases to 180 cm very slight change of water table depth is observed which demonstrates that the soil freezing process does not influence the groundwater below 180 cm in this area to evaluate the reliability of the simulations the observed water table depth during the freezing thawing period under different pre freezing water table depths 50 cm 70 cm 100 cm 140 cm are also shown in fig 10 g j these observations are obtained from the yonglian irrigation field and other sites named as 182 165 and 179 in hetao irrigation district with the same soil texture to the study area although the observed and simulated water table depth shows obvious deviations very similar variation trends can be found between the observations and simulations under the same pre freezing water table depth conditions which shows the reliability of the model results in general it can also be found in fig 10 that the change of water table depth is highly correlated with the change of freezing and thawing depth during the soil freezing period the water table depth increases which is caused by the upward migration of water to freezing soils during the soil thawing period the water table depth decreases which is caused by part of melting water moving from frozen zone to groundwater by gravity 4 5 upward flow of groundwater to the freezing soil the upward flow of groundwater to the freezing soil in this paper is defined as the decline of water storage of groundwater zone under the pre freezing water table depth which is calculated by the water mass balance of groundwater zone as mentioned above soil freezing process has significant influence on the water table depth and upward flow of groundwater changes along water table dynamics the simulated upward flow of groundwater under different pre freezing water table depth and soil surface temperature are shown in fig 11 it should be noted that the relationship between the upward flow of groundwater and the accumulated negative soil surface temperature shown in fig 11 is based on ignoring the impact of snowpack and without other hydraulic processes changing the groundwater dynamics e g lateral groundwater flow it can be found that the maximum upward flow of groundwater simulated by the proposed model is 3 53 cm when h 0 value is 50 cm to evaluate the accuracy of simulation results the measured maximum upward flow of groundwater during the freezing period of 2017 to 2018 nearby the five monitoring wells a c e g and h with the pre freezing depth of 50 cm are calculated which are 4 51 cm 5 4 cm 3 24 cm 3 57 cm 7 61 cm and the average value is 4 87 cm although the measured values fluctuate strongly the simulated value is consistent with most measured ones which shows that the simulated result is reasonable furthermore the relationship between the maximum upward flow of groundwater with the pre freezing water table depth obtained by the proposed model is analyzed as showed in fig 12 a it can be found that the maximum upward flow of groundwater has a slight increase trend when h 0 is shallower than 100 cm and then decreases obviously with the increase of h 0 this variation trend is similar to the observations of lysimeter tests obtained by chen et al 2018 as shown in fig 12 b although the water table depth was fixed during the experiments of chen et al 2018 while it varied in the simulation the maximum upward flow of groundwater happened under the water table depth of 100 cm and then decreases with the increase of the water table depth as shown in fig 12 b the reason is that there is smaller unsaturated soil zone to store upward water with shallower pre freezing water table which results in the increase of upward flow of groundwater along the increase of pre freezing water table depth at a certain critical value which is 100 cm in the simulation and in the experiments of chen et al 2018 as shown in fig 12 this critical value of pre freezing water table depth 100 cm could be different in other locations with specific soil characteristics and hydrothermal conditions however the distance of freezing front and groundwater table becomes too large to decline the matric potential gradient when the pre freezing water table depth becomes deeper than the critical value which will decrease the ability of upward water migration induced by freezing process thus the simulation results show in fig 12 a are reasonable since it is difficult to measure the upward flow of groundwater during the freezing period a simple formula representing the upward flow of groundwater to vadose zone in the freezing period is developed the relationship between the upward flow of groundwater and the accumulated negative soil surface temperature is developed by fitting the simulations as the following formula 29 y 0 t s b a t s b b t s c y max t s c where y is the upward flow of groundwater in the freezing period cm ts is the accumulated negative soil surface temperature d a cm d and c d are the empirical parameters b d is the minimum accumulated negative temperature causing upward migration of groundwater ymax cm is the maximum amount of upward flow of groundwater to freezing soils the fitting curves and the resulting regression equations as well as the model evaluation criterion are shown in fig 11 since the upward flow of groundwater is 0 when h0 is 220 cm there are only 5 fitting curves with the pre freezing water table depth of 50 cm 70 cm 100 cm 140 cm and 180 cm the r2 values are all above 0 85 and the corresponding rmses are all lower than 0 5 cm the empirical parameter a is significantly impacted by the pre freezing water table depth as shown in fig 13 it can be found that a has an exponential relationship with the pre freezing water table depth and the r2 value is 0 94 thus eq 29 can be further rewritten as 30 y 0 t s b 0 082 t s b exp 0 027 h 0 b t s c y max t s c where h 0 is the pre freezing water table depth this equation provides an easy way to calculate the upward flow of groundwater during the freezing period 4 6 rational pre freezing water table depth rational pre freezing water table depth is important to ensure the suitable soil thermal and moisture conditions for crop growth after the freezing thawing period in this study sowing is assumed to happen on april 10th and the germination stage lasts 10 days after sowing the seeding depth is 5 cm and the lowest temperature of seed germination for maize is 10 sánchez et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the suitable soil moisture at this stage are set from 0 21 to 0 27 cm3 cm3 hou et al 2007 the seedling period is from april 20th to may 30th the soil temperatures and total soil water contents at the depth of 5 cm with various pre freezing water table depth and soil surface temperature scenarios are shown in fig 14 the soil surface temperature owns more important influence on the soil temperature the soil temperatures can satisfy the required thermal condition of 10 for the germination stage under most scenarios of pre freezing water table depth with st3 while it is lower than 10 with st1 the pre freezing water table depth has greater influence on the soil moisture it can ensure that the soil moisture ranges from 0 21 cm3 cm3 to 0 27 cm3 cm3 when the pre freezing water table depth ranges between 100 cm and 140 cm the soil moisture is lower than 0 21 cm3 cm3 when the pre freezing water table depth is larger than 140 cm the lower pre freezing water table depth than 100 cm results in soil moisture larger than 0 27 cm3 cm3 during the seedling period the potential accumulated root uptake amount until may 31th is 2 26 cm the actual accumulated root uptake amount on 31th may under different scenarios are shown in fig 15 it is found that the soil surface temperature has very small influence on the actual accumulated root uptake amount under the same pre freezing water table depth while the pre freezing water table depth impacts the actual accumulated root uptake amount significantly the actual accumulated amount of root uptake decreases from 2 22 cm to 1 57 cm along with the increase of the pre freezing water table depth under the st2 the actual accumulated root uptake amount is larger than 80 of the potential one when the pre freezing water table is lower than 140 cm which would not harm the crop growing kiziloglu et al 2009 in general by comprehensive considering the soil thermal and moisture conditions the rational pre freezing water table depth is 100 cm 5 conclusions a one dimensional water and heat coupled model was developed and applied to figure out the influence of soil freezing processes on the upward flow of groundwater to the vadose zone the model accuracy was evaluated by comparing the results with those obtained by shaw the model was applied to analyze dynamics of soil water content soil temperature and upward flow of groundwater to freezing soils in yonglian irrigation field of heato irrigation district the major conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the proposed model with three level iteration scheme can capture the characteristics of soil moisture soil temperature and water table depth accurately in the freezing thawing period with complex soil texture and boundary conditions the model performances well in keeping water mass balance in the simulation 2 the subzero soil surface temperature and pre freezing water table depth are the two factors to influence the water table depth in the freezing period in the study area the deepest impact depth of soil frozen process is 180 cm in the study area 3 the pre freezing water table depth also effects the soil freezing process the maximum freezing depth has a negative relation with the pre freezing water table depth when it is shallower than 180 cm 4 an empirical formula is developed to calculate the upward flow of groundwater to freezing soils which can be estimated by the accumulated negative soil surface temperature and pre freezing water table depth 5 to ensure the suitable soil thermal and moisture conditions for crop germination and seedling the rational pre freezing water table depth is 100 cm in the study area 6 the model fails to capture the soil water content when it exceeds the saturated water content in the freezing thawing period the soil structure change caused by tillage and frost heaving should be considered in future model development declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

5578,water level prediction is crucial to water diversion through cascaded channels and the prediction accuracies are still unsatisfying due to the difficulties and challenges caused by complex interactions and relations among cascaded channels we adopt two kinds of neural networks to build our water level prediction models for cascaded channels 2 4 6 h ahead with high prediction accuracy first the raw hydrological data of cascaded channels are augmented using spatial and temporal windows which produces data sets with high dimensional features then multilayer perceptron mlp and recurrent neural network rnn are adopted to build the water level prediction model with the help of the augmented data containing the implicit correlation among multiple channels in spatial dimension and multiple data records in temporal dimension china s south to north water diversion project is taken as the case study experimental results show that our models outperform support vector machine

multilayer percetion recurrent neural network 1 introduction water shortage is a serious problem faced by countries and regions all over the world many countries are devoted to develop rational utilization and management of water resources christmann et al 2007 kummu et al 2010 gessler et al 2010 one way is to build large scale artificial water diversion projects to increase the distribution uniformity of water resources and improve the utilization efficiency most of the artificial water diversion projects span multiple basins and need to be divided into cascaded channels to divert water each channel can be seen as a small reservoir whose water storage is reflected by the water level behind the upstream sluice gate and in front of the downstream sluice gate water level is an important factor during water diversion serious damages will occur if the water level is beyond the threshold it is thus essential to predict the water level of the channels to forecast possible upcoming damages various water level prediction approaches have been proposed for a single reservoir lake or river which are also suitable for predicting the water level of cascaded channels karimi et al 2019 zaji and bonakdari 2019 yuan et al 2018 based on the time scale over which predictions are made the existing works can be classified into short term predictions and long term predictions in short term predictions water level is predicted hours or minutes ahead and is mainly used for real time prediction to evaluate the possible upcoming damage for example a comparative study on a short term water level prediction using artificial neural network ann and neuro fuzzy system was performed by bazartseren b et al 2003 where the two approaches were used to handle the situations with scarce data and the predictions are based on the upstream hydrological conditions only chang and chang 2006 used neuro fuzzy hybrid approach to construct a water level forecasting system during flood periods

other studies on short term water level prediction can be found in recent works phitakwinai et al 2016 hou et al 2015 berkhahn et al 2019 guo et al 2019 in long term predictions the water level is predicted days weeks or months ahead and is mainly used to reveal the law of water level fluctuation for rivers reservoirs or lakes for example water level predicting performance of urmia lake located in the north west of iran were compared by using analytical linear statistic and intelligent methods and comparative results reveal that the intelligent methods are superior to traditional models for modeling lake level behavior as complex hydrological phenomena kakahaji et al 2013 sun and trevor 2018 proposed a framework based on multiple model combination methods mmcms for maximum breakup water

their corresponding indicators predictor variables and the combining models link the relations between the mbwl predicted by each member model and the mbwl observed khan et al 2016 built an artificial neural network model using daily water flow and level data of 4 years 2010 2013 to predict discharges and water levels of the ramganga river catchment of the ganga basin in india other studies on long term water level prediction can be found in recent works yadav and eliza 2017 zaji and bonakdari 2018 ghorbani et al 2017 malekzadeh et al 2019 takehiko et al 2019 li et al 2019 neural networks such as multilayer perceptron mlp and recurrent neural network rnn are able to learn and model non linear and complex relationships which is really important because many of the relationships between inputs and outputs are non linear in real life mlp and rnn have been used in many areas seide et al 2011 cho et al 2014 miao et al 2015 and proved their ability to adress complicated non linear problems existing studies mainly focus on the water level prediction of a single reservoir or channel as far as we know most existing water level prediction work based on artificial intelligence use ann rf svm and other basic machine learning models to construct the prediction models however water level prediction is much more difficult for cascaded channels than for a single channel reservoir or lake the difficulties and challenges are that the water level of one channel is affected not only by itself but also by upstream channels and downstream channels not only by the last time step but also by time steps ahead traditional approaches have made great progress in water level prediction but may get into trouble to build a model with acceptable accuracy under this situation because the continuous water flow along the cascaded channels will bring about the propagation of hydrodynamic features in space and time to address these difficulties and challenges we adopt mlp and rnn to build two prediction models with satisfying prediction accuracy mlp based water level prediction mwlp and rnn based water level prediction rwlp our major contributions are threefold 1 spatial window and temporal window are proposed to augment the raw data of separate channel so that the augmented data containing the implicit spatial and temporal correlations can be utilized by our model directly 2 mlp and rnn are adopted to build the real time water level prediction model mwlp and rwlp for cascaded channels with high accuracy by mining the implicit correlation of hydrodynamic features among multiple channels in the spatial dimension and multiple data records in the temporal dimension 3 extensive experiments are carried out to compare the performances between our models and state of the art models on the case study of the south to north water diversion project snwdp experimental results show that our models outperform svm and ann by providing more satisfying prediction accuracy the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the overall methodology used in this work section 3 presents our two water level prediction models based on mlp and rnn in detail respectively section 4 shows the experimental results followed by conclusions and future work in section 5 2 methodology in the area of hydrologic and water resources research the water level in front of the gate is a very important hydrodynamic factor and is also the most intuitive and easiest data to observe for the actual water transmission and dispatching staff this paper mainly focuses on the prediction of the water level in front of the gate of cascaded channels the water level in front of cascaded channels is affected by the hydrodynamic data of the upstream channels and downstream channels at different times the schematic diagram of channels gates and other buildings is shown in fig 1 in order to simplify the model design and remove unnecessary noise we mainly consider those closely related hydrodynamic features such as water level in front of the gates the water level behind the gates number of gate holes open size of each gate hole gate flow and outlet flow the hydrodynamic features of each channel are recorded every two hours as shown in table 1 the meaning of each item is 1 date the date when the data was recorded 2 time the time when the data was recorded according to the scheduling experiences of our study case which will be detailed in the later sections 2 h is a reasonable interval to record the data so the value of time item increases in the unit of 2 h 3 water level in front of gate it s the value that our models want to predict and it s also the data label for model training it is measured by water level meters and recorded with centimeter as the unit as the measurements of water level meters may contain some errors and the water fluctuates in front of the gate the item takes an average value of several measurements around time 4 water level behind gate it s the water level behind the recorded gate and is also measured by water level meters with centimeter as unit 5 flow it s the water flow that go through the gate as a gate contains several gate holes whose number is presented in the item number of gate holes the flow here is the sum of flows of all gate holes it s recorded with the unit m 3 s 6 number of gate holes each gate contains 1 2 or 3 gate holes whose opening size may be different from each other 7 gate hole 1 gate hole 2 gate hole 3 these items are the opening sizes of gate holes the number of which is given in the item number of gate holes 8 outlet flow this item is the sum of flows of all the outlets in the upstream channel of the gate this item means the speed at which water are going out of the channel from outlets the unit of this item is m 3 s hydrodynamic features are propagated to the upstream and downstream channels with the flow of water and the hydrodynamic features of upstream and downstream channels at the current moment will affect the water level in front of the target gate moments later through the flow propagation across several channels to study the influence of different numbers and time steps of upstream and downstream channels on the prediction of the target channel water level 2 4 6 h ahead we build two prediction models 1 mlp based mwlp takes hydrodynamic features of multiple time steps of upstream and downstream channels as input and water level of the target gate for the next 2 4 6 h as output 2 rnn based rwlp is composed of similar inputs and outputs as mwlp but rwlp also makes use of the implicit nonlinear correlation features between different time steps of channels and achieve a little more satisfying accuracy 2 1 introduction to mlp mlp is called multi layer perceptron mlp allan 1999 the neural network layers of mlp can be classified into three types according to their locations input layer hidden layer and output layer generally speaking the first layer is the input layer the last layer is the output layer the middle layers between input layer and output layer are the hidden layers and the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each hidden layer will determine the model size and also affect the model fitting ability if the training data is sufficient layers are fully connected that is any neuron in layer i is connected to each neuron in layer i 1 mlp seems complicated but locally each neuron node performs the same operations as the perceptron i e a linear relationship plus an activation function suppose the weight between the mth neuron of i 1 th layer and the nth neuron at the ith layer is w mn i the bias of the nth neuron at the ith layer is b n i the number of neurons of the i 1 th layer is n i 1 the outputs of the i 1 th layer are a m i 1 m 1 2 n i 1 the activation function of the nth neuron of the ith layer is σ then the output of the nth neuron of the ith layer can be represented as 1 a n i σ m 1 n i 1 w mn i a m i 1 b n i there are many types of activation function σ i e sigmoid tanh relu nair and hinton 2010 russakovsky et al 2015 and leaky relu maas et al 2013 which are defined as 2 sigmoid x 1 1 e x 3 tanh x e x e x e x e x 4 relu x max 0 x 5 leakyrelu x max α x x where α is a very small constant it is due to the addition of nonlinear activation function in neuron computation that the whole neural network can learn arbitrary complex transformation relationship between input and output 2 2 introduction to rnn rnn is a special neural network structure proposed according to the viewpoint that human cognition is based on past experience and memory unlike mlp rnn not only takes into account the input of the previous moment but also gives the network a memory function of the previous content rnn has been widely used and has achieved great success in many fields such as speech recognition graves et al 2013 sak et al 2014 language translation cho et al 2014 jean et al 2014 image caption venugopalan et al 2015 sutskever et al 2014 and commodity recommendation han et al 2017 as shown in fig 2 rnn will remember the previous information and apply it to the calculation of the current output that is the nodes between the hidden layers are no longer disconnected but connected and the input of the hidden layer is not only from the input layer but also from the previous hidden layer suppose s t is the output of the hidden layer at time t x t is the input of rnn at time t o t is the output of rnn at time t w is the weight parameter between hidden layers u is the weight parameter between the input layer and the hidden layer v is the weight parameter between the hidden layer and the output layer the bias of the hidden layer is b the activation function of the hidden layer is σ the bias of the output layer is c the activation function of the output layer is η 6 s t σ ux t ws t 1 b 7 o t η vs t c then substitude equtation 6 into 7 over and over again the following formula can be obtained 8 o t η vs t c 9 η v σ ux t w σ ux t 1 w σ ux t 2 w σ ux t 3 from the formula 9 it can be seen that the output of rnn is affected by previous input values x t x t 1 x t 2 x t 3 which is also the reason why rnn can remember any number of input values many time steps ago the special memory function of rnn is closely related to the special structure of neurons in the hidden layer common hidden layer neurons include rnn long short term memory lstm gers et al 2000 lipton 2015 and gated recurrent unit gru chung et al 2014 whose neuronal structures are shown in fig 3 rnn neuron has only one activation function tanh which can also be relu or any other activation function and the problem of gradient disappearance will appear after using back propagation through time bptt algorithm for multiple time steps training gradient explosion occurs when the relu activation function is used and there are eigenvalues greater than 1 in w therefore rnn neurons cannot be trained for a long time the appearance of lstm and gru neuron structures effectively solves the problem of gradient disappearance or gradient explosion lstm is a complex neuron node with various components such as input gate output gate and forgetting gate the pink circle inside lstm in fig 3 when x t input data of current time step h t 1 the output of lstm itself at last time step and c t 1 the output of adjacent lstm at last time step are inputted to the lstm at time step t these gates input gate output gate and forgetting gate determine how much information will be forgotten and how much will be adopted to build the outputs h t and c t of current time step when this kind of special structure and mechanism work together with the outer recurrence of recurrent neural network the back propagation gradient can flow for long durations to avoid the problem of gradient disappearance or gradient explosion gru achieves the same performance by utilizing its update gate and reset gate the pink circle inside gru in fig 3 in a similar way 3 model and algorithm in this section we describe in detail the two prediction models mwlp and rwlp including how data are augmented and how the models are constructed 3 1 mlp based prediction model mwlp to address the problem caused by the spread of hydrodynamic features through the flow of water we build a mlp based model that can utilize hydrodynamic features by training across multiple spatial dimensions and temporal dimensions and explore the implicit correlations between hydrodynamic features of multiple adjacent channels in continuous time steps first the observed hydrodynamic data of cascaded channels are preprocessed with three steps then the data is used to train the mwlp model with the back propagation algorithm finally the mwlp model can be used to predict water level 2 4 6 h ahead with satisfying accuracy 3 1 1 data preprocessing generally speaking the original hydrodynamic data of cascaded channels contain many files each one of which corresponds to one channel we take three steps to preprocess the raw data including augmentation reduction and shaping 1 augmentation in order to get the maximum spatial temporal correlation of hydrodynamic features the concepts of spatial window and temporal window are proposed spatial window is mainly used to assemble multiple adjacent channels participating in model training in space and temporal window is mainly used to assemble multiple adjacent time slices participating in model training in time as shown in fig 4 the joint spatial window and temporal window effectively augment the training data set for example if the original channel has 19704 time steps of data and each data is composed of 8 features then the total data size is 19704 8 when spatial window size is 5 and temporal window size is 6 the total training data size is enlarged to 118224 40 the data size is enlarged by 30 times and the augmented data contains the spatial temporal correlation of hydrodynamic features generated by water flow propagation that was not contained in the original data of a single channel the data augmentation here is not a physical expansion but one kind of feature reusing as the data and useful features that can be obtained from the actual water diversion project are limited this kind of data augmentation is very useful for our model training which is also very popular in deep learning it can improve the model performances which will be shown in the section of model training and evaluation 2 reduction the augmented spatial temporal data cannot be directly used for model training the reason is that the water level prediction we make is under the condition that the gate opening does not change during the prediction period this means that we need to screen out the training data collected when the gate holes remains unchanged during this period as shown in fig 5 the size of spatial window is w h the size of temporal window is w v the sequence numbers of all gate holes in spatial window w h is stored in the set k and the data set of each window is represented by d w h w v then the earliest data is at the top and the most recent data is at the bottom starting with the first data slide the window down one slice at a time after each swipe check whether the data set in the window meets the following conditions k k i j w v d ik d jk where d ik means the data at the ith row and the kth column of d w h w v and d jk means the data at the jth row and the kth column of d w h w v only when the above conditions are met the current window data set d w h w v is used as a piece of training data and the target channel water level of 1 2 3 time slices after the first time slice of current window corresponding to the next 2 4 6 h respectively is added as the training data label at the end of the data if w v 3 then the reduction will finish normally if w v 3 then the reduction must finish at the third data from the bottom 3 pieces of data are used to generate labels for training it means max w v 3 data must be left for the last reduction operation 3 shaping since the input of mwlp model is a one dimensional vector and the augmented data set using spatial window and temporal window is a two dimensional matrix it is necessary to flatten the above data set into a one dimensional vector all timestamps in fig 5 are removed during shaping because they do not contain any useful information in addition to accelerate the convergence speed of parameter optimization algorithm and improve the prediction accuracy we use the following normalization procedure for each one dimensional vector of the input data x norm x μ δ where μ and δ are the mean and standard deviation of hydrodynamic features in the dimension x respectively after data preprocessing the dimension of the input data vector is w h w v 8 which is determined by the spatial window size w h and the temporal window size w v when choosing the values for w h and w v there is a tradeoff between the model complexity and accuracy which will be discussed in detail in the later section of model training and evaluation the output of the model is a vector containing 3 values water level predictions 2 h ahead 4 h ahead and 6 h ahead 3 1 2 mwlp model architecture to choose a suitable model structure for mwlp we adopt the corrected akaike information criterion caic sugiura 1978 as the evaluation criteria for models with different numbers of layers and neurons as follows caic n ln 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 2 k 2 k k 1 n k 1 where k is the number of parameters of the model n is the number of training samples y i is the observed water level and y i is the predicted water level by the model we conduct the model evaluation experiment and get the caic values for models with different structure and size as shown in table 2 it can be found the mwlp model with one hidden layer 1024 neurons achieves the lowest caic when the number of neurons in the first layer is less than 1024 the less the neurons the larger the caic value which may be caused by the large sum square of residue due to the weak approximation ability of the model when the number of neurons in the first layer is more than 1024 the more the neurons the larger the caic value which may be caused by the large k due to the over parameterization of the model so the model architecture of mwlp is built with one hidden layer 1024 neurons as shown in fig 6 it includes one input layer one hidden layer and one output layer respectively the input layer receives the one dimensional vector data d n i 1 i 2 i 3 i n 1 i n after the propagation calculation of the middle hidden layer the predicted water level for the next 2 4 6 h is obtained in the output layer as shown in fig 6 each channel has a designed water level and the actual water level was observed to fluctuate around the designed water level so in order to integrate the scheduling experiences into the model the loss function l mse θ of mwlp is designed as follows 10 l mse mwlp θ α i 1 n y y θ 2 1 α i 1 n y d y θ 2 n where θ is the set of network parameters of the mwlp model n is the batch size of training data y is the observed water level in front of the channel gate y is the predicted water level y d is the designed water level and α is a positive coefficient that is close to one objective function j θ for parameter optimization is as follows 11 j mwlp θ l mse mwlp θ λ 2 n θ θ 2 12 α i 1 n y y θ 2 1 α i 1 n y d y θ 2 n λ 2 n θ θ 2 where λ is the hyperparameter of l 2 regular item which is added to avoid model over fitting by limiting too large parameters and the meaning of other parameters are the same as those in eq 10 the hyperparameters of mwlp are shown in table 3 3 2 rnn based prediction model rwlp water level prediction based on historical data is a typical time series prediction rnn such as lstm and gru has the ability of historical memory and has been deeply studied and widely applied in many fields such as text translation speech recognition and commodity recommendation this paper adopts rnn to build our rwlp model to predict the water level of cascaded channels multiple time steps ahead compared with various existing methods based on ann svm or rf rwlp model has natural advantages in improving the accuracy and reliability of model prediction 3 2 1 data preprocessing similar to mwlp of the previous section the spatial window w h and the temporal window w v are also adopted in the data preprocessing of rwlp the difference is that in the process of rnn expansion each time slice outputs a predicted value as shown in fig 2 therefore when preprocessing data for rwlp we need to add the water level in front of the gate of multiple time slices into the training data set as labels according to the temporal window w v and the predicted timesteps w p as shown in fig 7 each training data of rwlp is composed of w h data which can be regarded as a data matrix and represented by d w v w h 1 each line of d w v w h 1 is composed of hydrodynamic features with width w v and a channel water level value as a label and the temporal distance between this label and the hydrodynamic features is w p similarly in order to accelerate the convergence of the model parameter optimization algorithm and improve the prediction accuracy of the model all data are normalized before data preparation and after the predicted value is obtained the inverse operation is carried out to generate the channel water level in front of the gate 3 2 2 rwlp model architecture each neuron in the hidden layer of the rwlp model has the function of memory therefore from the perspective of structure the rnn based model includes the input layer the hidden layer and the output layer as shown in fig 8 the hidden layer has n hidden units and the data dimension of the input layer is w h limited by space we only present the network structure diagram containing one hidden layer in the experimental comparison part of the following chapter we will compare and analyze the influence of different hidden layers on the prediction accuracy of the model for each training data d w v w h 1 our rwlp model will run w v time steps due to the recurrent structure of rnn as shown in fig 2 for any time step t t 1 2 w v the first w h hydrodynamic features of d t w h 1 correspond to x t 1 x t 2 x t w h in fig 8 after the forward propagation the network output y t w p of the tth timestep can be obtained as presented in equtation 13 and 14 13 s t σ w t i x t w t h s t 1 b h 14 y t w p w t o s t b o where w t i w t o w t h b h b o represent the input layer parameter matrix output layer parameter vector hidden layer parameter matrix hidden layer node bias vector and output node bias value of the tth time step respectively our rwlp model is based on the hydrodynamic feature of the first w v time slices to predict the target channel water level w p time slices ahead that is to say the output y w v w p of the last timestep in fig 8 is the predicted water level in front of the target gate however in order to improve the training efficiency and prediction accuracy of rwlp we take the deviations between the predicted output value and the corresponding label of w v time steps as the component of the loss function at the same time scheduling experiences are integrated into our model by modifying the loss function of rnn as follows 15 l mse rwlp θ 1 n i 1 n 1 w v t 1 w v α y t w p i y t w p i θ 2 1 α y d y t w p i θ 2 where θ is the parameter set of the entire network model n is batch size w v is the temporal window size of a training sample data i e the number of time steps y t w p i is the actual value of the tth time step of the ith instance y t w p i is the predicted value of the tth time step of the ith instance y d is the designed water level and α is a positive coefficient that is close to one then the objective function of parameters to be optimized is 16 j rwlp θ l mse rwlp θ λ 2 n θ θ 2 17 1 n i 1 n 1 w v t 1 w v α y t w p i y t w p i θ 2 1 α y d y t w p i θ 2 λ 2 n θ θ 2 where λ is the hyperparameter of l 2 regular item and regular term l 2 is added into the objective function to avoid over fitting of the rwlp model by limiting too many or too large parameters the training process of rwlp model is shown in algorithm1 algorithm 1 rwlp model

rnn with combinations of different spatial windows and temporal windows data sets d w h w v 1 with different sizes are constructed and neural network models with different hidden layers and nodes are built in the cases of different combinations of w h and w v the network parameter differences are mainly reflected in the number of input nodes the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes in each hidden layer while other hyperparameters are the same limited by space we only give the neural network hyperparameters of the rwlp model with 1 hidden layer as shown in table 4 4 study area china is a country with a large population and limited water resources and the distribution of water resources is very uneven southern water resources are far more than the northern water resources geng et al 2001 wang and jin 2006 south to north water diversion project snwdp launched in 2002 has effectively alleviated the problem of uneven distribution of water resources in the north and south as shown in fig 9 the middle route of snwdp has diverted a large amounts of water from danjiangkou reservoir in hubei province to many important northern provinces and cities such as henan hebei tianjin and beijing which effectively alleviates the water shortage in these cities berrittella et al 2006 zhang 2009 zhang et al 2009 webber et al 2017 the water diversion distance of the middle route project is over 1200 km and more than 60 large gates are located along the route the controls over gates are closely related and it is also very important and extremely difficult to keep the water level stable among all gates along the route if the water level in any channel is out of control it will affect the normal operation and safe water supply of the whole line and even destroy the channel dam causing great harm to the lives and property of the local people along the route therefore it is of great social value to study the regulation of gate operation of snwdp to scientifically and reasonably predict the change trend of water level in all channels and to provide early warning and intervention of water level in channels so as to guarantee the normal production and domestic water supply of all cities along the route sdwdp started to run in 2014 after 12 years construction larson 2014 during the actual running of snwdp important hydrodynamic features such as the gate opening size channel water level in front of the gate channel water level behind the gate and flow rate are recorded every two hours with nearly 5 years of running a large number of actual hydrodynamic features in various climates and running conditions have been accumulated 19704 pieces of data 1 1 2015 30 6 2019 are used to train and test our models data are cleaned with the strategy that blank or singular values are filled with values of previous timestep in order to ensure the reasonability of the tests for our models we employ two schemes to sample the test data stratified sampling and k fold cross validation first according to the scheduling experiences of workers at snwdp the recorded data of each year belongs to 3 categories water rich period water normal period and water poor period so we make use of stratified sampling to sort each data into one of the 3 categories second inside each category k fold cross validation is used to sample test data and k is set as 10 in our experiments so the ratios of test samples are 10 both for each category and the full recorded data 5 model training and evaluation 5 1 evaluation criteria in order to achieve the optimum model structure and evaluate the performance of different models several criteria are employed as following 1 pearson correlation coefficient pcc is used to represent the degree of linear correlation between two random variables as pcc is the most popular measurement for correlation coefficient cc is used here for short we use cc to measure the degree of linear correlation between the predicted value of the model and the actual value as is presented below 18 corr y y cov x y σ x σ y 19 i 1 n y i μ y i y i μ y i 1 n y i μ y 2 i 1 n y i μ y 2 where y i represents the predicted value y i represents the observed value μ y represents the mean of predictions μ y represents the mean of observations and n represents the number of samples 2 root mean square error rmse makes an excellent general purpose error metric for numerical predictions compared to the similar mean absolute error rmse amplifies and severely punishes large errors and the equation is 20 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 where the meanings of y i y i and n are the same as the above 3 mean absolute error mae is the average of absolute errors which can better reflect the actual situation of predicted errors the lower the mae value the better the prediction effect and the equation is written as 21 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i where the meanings of y i y i and n are the same as the above 4 nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse is used to assess the predictive power of our models which is defined as 22 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y y i 2 where the meanings of y i y i and n are the same as the above y is the mean of observations nse can range from to 1 nse 1 corresponds to a perfect match of the predictions to the observations nse 0 indicates that the predictions are as accurate as the mean of the observations nse 0 indicates that the predictions are worse than the mean of observations 5 persistence index pi measures the relative magnitude of the variance of errors between predictions and observations to the variance of the errors obtained by the use of a simple persistence model which is defined as 23 pi 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i 1 y i 2 the optimalvalue of pi is 1 and pi should be larger than 0 to indicate minimally acceptable performance levels the simple persistence model represents a minimal information situation where it is assumed that the best prediction for the next time step is the observation at the current time step the combination of these metrics can evaluate the performance of our model from different aspects mae evaluates the performance in a common way rmse does it by enlarging the effect of abnormal predictions and pcc cc does it by reflecting the trend of the prediction values compared with the observed values nse compares the performance of our model with that of the mean observation pi evaluates our model s performance by comparing it with a persistent model the observation of the previous time step so the experimental results can be more comprehensively evaluated and the advantages of our model can be more persuasive 5 2 results and analysis of mwlp model in order to compare the effect of different adjacent channel number and different continuous time slice number on the prediction of mwlp model we test each evaluation metric with combinations of different channels and time slices as shown in table 5 and the deviation between the prediction and the observation as shown in fig 10 mwlp hm vn represents the mwlp model constructed by using hydrodynamic features of m adjacent upstream and downstream channels and n continuous time slices as training data in order to analyze the influence of different spatial window size and temporal window size on the prediction performance of mwlp more comprehensively we increase the spatial window size and temporal window size from 1 to 10 and compare the rmses of the models due to space limitation here we only give the rmse of mwlp for 6 h prediction as shown in fig 11 when the spatial window size and temporal window size increase at initial the rmse of mwlp drops rapidly however when the spatial window increases to 4 and the temporal window increases to 3 the rmse declines more and more slowly and in a few cases the rmse value fluctuates such as h 4 and v 8 h 9 and v 7 it can be seen from table 5 that increasing the size of the spatial window or the size of the temporal window can improve the accuracy of the water level in front of the gate predicted by the model but as the size of the spatial window or the temporal window increases rmse and mae of mwlp do not decline rapidly as before especially for the prediction 2 h ahead mwlp h2 v3 has achieve acceptable performances it also should be noticed that pi for 2 h ahead is not very high which is mainly between 0 41 and 0 46 it may be caused by the reason that the observation of the water level 2 h later tends to be persistent with the current value so our prediction is only a little better than the persistence model used by pi metic but for predictions 6 h ahead pi is much higher and it means our model can provide a satisfying prediction accuracy compared with the persistence model it also can be seen from fig 10 that with the increase of spatial window and temporal window the accuracy is gradually improved but when the spatial window and temporal window increase from mwlp h2 v3 to mwlp h3 v4 the accuracy is not improved as significantly as that from mwlp h1 v2 to mwlp h2 v3 this is because when the size of the spatial window and temporal window reaches 2 and 3 respectively both the spatial features of the two upstream and downstream channels and the temporal features of these five channels 6 h ahead are used to predict the water level in front of the gate mwlp has obtained enough hydrodynamic features and implied correlations and the accuracy of mwlp 2 4 6 h ahead has reached as high as 92 85 87 23 and 79 35 respectively with deviations less than 1 cm the input of more spatial temporal window features to mwlp is of little help to the improvement of the prediction accuracy 5 3 results and analysis of rwlp model in this section we experiment the rwlp model with different temporal and spacial windows with different kinds of neurons lstm gru rnn as hidden layer with different numbers of hidden layers in order to compare the effect of the different number of adjacent channels and continuous time slices on rwlp we test each evaluation metric with the different channel and time slice combinations as shown in table 6 and the deviation of the prediction from the observation as shown in fig 12 where lstm is used as the hidden neural unit in rwlp rwlp hm vn represents the rwlp model constructed by using hydrodynamic features of m adjacent upstream and downstream channels and n continuous time slices as training data the accuracy of water level prediction 2 h ahead is not significantly improved just by increasing the spatial window size and the temporal window size the reason is that the hydrodynamic features for two consecutive time slices and implied correlation that rwlp h1 v2 model gets is enough to predict the water level 2 h ahead and the hydrodynamic features of further channel or earlier time can not propagate to the target channel within 2 h so the increment of spatial window size or temporal window size can do no help for improvement of the accuracy 2 h ahead but we can see that the prediction accuracy 6 h ahead can be improved by enlarging the spatial window to 3 and temporal window to 4 similarly in order to more fully analyze the effect of spatial window size and temporal window size on the performance of rwlp we test and compare the rmse value of rwlp 6 h ahead when the spatial window size ranges from 1 to 10 and the temporal window size ranges from 2 to 11 as shown in fig 13 we can see that increasing the size of temporal window has less effect on the performance of rwlp than that of mwlp when the temporal window size reaches 4 rmse value of rwlp no longer drops significantly the reason for this could be that the memory function of rnn enables it to remember the feature information of multiple previous moments so it does not require too much temporal window to provide implicit time correlated features in addition we also compare the effects of using lstm and gru as hidden neural cells on the rwlp accuracy when the spatial window size and temporal window size are fixed with 2 and 3 respectively as shown in fig 14 whether lstm or gru is used as hidden neurons to predict the channel water level 2 4 6 h ahead there is little difference in accuracy this indicates that the memory functions of lstm and gru are similar in our prediction model we also experiment with the model using rnn as hidden layer neurons and find that the model can not be trained for long time steps due to the gradient disappearance or gradient explosion the performance comparisons of rmse are presented in table 7 and fig 15 it can be found that the rmse of rnn is much higher than that of lstm and gru and the rmses of lstm and gru are similar to each other so it s better to use lstm or gru as the hidden layer than rnn as the hidden layer as described in the section of rwlp model the number of hidden layers also has effects on the prediction accuracy especially when the spatial window and temporal window are large the dimension of each training data also increases at this time increasing the number of hidden layers with more parameters can improve the model fitting ability if the number of training data is enough as shown in fig 16 in the context of predicting the channel water level of 50th gate 6 h ahead with spatial window h 9 and temporal window v 5 when the number of hidden layer neurons lstm increases from 32 to 64 the accuracies with deviations less than 1 2 3 cm increase from 69 32 88 64 94 55 to 81 36 94 09 97 05 respectively when the number of hidden layer neurons is increased to 128 the evaluation metrics of the model hardly improves as the number of lstm layer neurons increases from 128 to 256 the accuracies with deviations less than 1 2 3 cm increase very little even decrease for deviation less than 1 cm from the above analysis we can find that rwlp model can obtain a relatively satisfying result when the spacial window is 2 and the temporal window is 3 lstm or gru is used as the hidden layer and the number of hidden layer is 128 5 4 performance comparison of different prediction models losts of researches based on ann and svm have focused on water level prediction of channel reservoir or lake and made great progress so we adopt these two kinds of approaches for comparison with our proposed model mwlp and rwlp here ann used for performance comparison is the neural network with the same structure one hidden layer with 1024 neurons as mwlp and is trained and tested with time delayed data a sliding time window with time lags 1 2 3 svm is implemented by using the nusvr api of scikit learn with nu 1 and kernel linear mwlp and rwlp used for performance comparisons are mwlp h2 v3 lstm h2 v3 and gru h2 v3 respectively mwlp h2 v3 is built with one hidden layer 1024 neurons and lstm h2 v3 gru h2 v3 is also built with one hidden layer 128 lstm gru neurons as shown in fig 17 and table 8 the accuracy of mwlp is significantly higher than that of svm although mwlp is implemented based on the neural network with the same size as ann mwlp adopts spatial window and temporal window in the preprocessing of input data to augment the hydrodynamic features mwlp is trained using the implicit hydrodynamic correlations between adjacent channels and continuous time slices that were not included in the ann model therefore mwlp can obtain a higher prediction accuracy than svm and ann similarly it can be found that the prediction accuracies of lstm h2 v3 and gru h2 v3 are higher than those of mwlp especially when predicting the water level 4 6 h ahead as shown in fig 18 we also compare the performances of svm ann mwlp h2 v3 lstm h2 v3 and gru h2 v3 for 6 h prediction in terms of rmse mae cc nse and pi respectively compared with svm the values of rmse mae cc nse and pi of mwlp h2 v3 are improved from 0 009837 0 008633 0 9855 0 9108 and 7 7025 to 0 006524 0 005455 0 9979 0 9949 and 0 75436 respectively which means the improvements are 33 67 36 81 1 26 and 8 41 for rmse mae cc and nse respectively the pi improvement of mwlp h2 v3 compared with svm is high and pi increase for a negative value 7 7025 to a positive value 0 75436 close to 1 similarly the rmse mae cc and nse improvements of lstm h2 v3 compared with svm are 34 78 44 53 1 32 9 198 respectively compared with ann the rmse mae cc and nse improvements of mwlp h2 v3 are 15 95 10 64 1 54 and 2 31 respectively and the improvements of lstm h2 v3 are 18 62 12 15 1 87 and 2 94 respectively compared with ann the pi also improves from 0 391 to 0 754 for mwlp h2 v3 and 0 761 for lstm h2 v3 respectively to compare these approaches from a modeling perspective caic is adopted again to evaluate the trade off between performance and simplicity of svm ann mwlp rwlp as shown in fig 19 although svm is the lightest model of the four models no more than ten thousand parameters it performs worst in terms of caic mainly due to its terrible prediction performances rwlp outperforms other models in terms of caic mainly because it can achieve high prediction performances as mwlp while keeping an acceptable model size no more than fifty thousand parameters mwlp outperforms ann a little because mwlp can achieve a slightly higher prediction accuracy than ann while keeping the same model size as ann so the experimental results suggest that rwlp is more suitable to apply in water level prediction of cascaded channels especially to apply in mobile devices with limited computing ability and memories by patrols along the channel 6 conclusions in this paper we propose two neural network models mwlp and rwlp to predict water level of cascaded channels 2 4 6 h ahead our two models can achieve satisfying accuracy due to their ability to mine the high dimensional correlated hydrodynamic features implied in the combinations of the spatial window and temporal window we have trained evaluated and tested the two models on the hydrodynamic data of the middle route of snwdp recorded in recent five years the experimental results show that the accuracies of mwlp 2 4 6 h ahead can reach as high as 92 85 87 23 and 79 35 with prediction deviation less than 1 cm and the accuracies of rwlp 2 4 6 h ahead can reach 93 16 90 82 and 87 73 due to the innate memory ability rwlp can achieve satisfying prediction performance while maintaining a acceptable model size compared with mwlp ann or svm based prediction approaches but we also find that the prediction deviations are higher than 5 cm for some extreme running conditions such as heavy rainy day and frozen day the reason is mainly that our models are built on the hydrodynamic features of the channels without any external data such as rainfall snowfall temperature and so on so our models perform poor under extreme weather conditions another problem to be solved is that a uniform model should be built to output the prediction for multiple channels at one time step without the need for building multiple models for the prediction of multiple channels future researches will focus on the water level prediction in extreme weather conditions and the building of a uniform model for multiple channels at one time step and also the attempting to make optimal controls for cascaded channels based on our prediction results declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
5578,water level prediction is crucial to water diversion through cascaded channels and the prediction accuracies are still unsatisfying due to the difficulties and challenges caused by complex interactions and relations among cascaded channels we adopt two kinds of neural networks to build our water level prediction models for cascaded channels 2 4 6 h ahead with high prediction accuracy first the raw hydrological data of cascaded channels are augmented using spatial and temporal windows which produces data sets with high dimensional features then multilayer perceptron mlp and recurrent neural network rnn are adopted to build the water level prediction model with the help of the augmented data containing the implicit correlation among multiple channels in spatial dimension and multiple data records in temporal dimension china s south to north water diversion project is taken as the case study experimental results show that our models outperform support vector machine svm by 34 78 44 53 1 32 and 9 198 in terms of root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae pearson correlation coefficient pcc and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse respectively the accuracies of our models with prediction deviations less than 1 cm 2 cm and 3 cm can reach as high as 81 36 94 09 and 97 05 respectively keywords water level prediction south to north water diversion project multilayer percetion recurrent neural network 1 introduction water shortage is a serious problem faced by countries and regions all over the world many countries are devoted to develop rational utilization and management of water resources christmann et al 2007 kummu et al 2010 gessler et al 2010 one way is to build large scale artificial water diversion projects to increase the distribution uniformity of water resources and improve the utilization efficiency most of the artificial water diversion projects span multiple basins and need to be divided into cascaded channels to divert water each channel can be seen as a small reservoir whose water storage is reflected by the water level behind the upstream sluice gate and in front of the downstream sluice gate water level is an important factor during water diversion serious damages will occur if the water level is beyond the threshold it is thus essential to predict the water level of the channels to forecast possible upcoming damages various water level prediction approaches have been proposed for a single reservoir lake or river which are also suitable for predicting the water level of cascaded channels karimi et al 2019 zaji and bonakdari 2019 yuan et al 2018 based on the time scale over which predictions are made the existing works can be classified into short term predictions and long term predictions in short term predictions water level is predicted hours or minutes ahead and is mainly used for real time prediction to evaluate the possible upcoming damage for example a comparative study on a short term water level prediction using artificial neural network ann and neuro fuzzy system was performed by bazartseren b et al 2003 where the two approaches were used to handle the situations with scarce data and the predictions are based on the upstream hydrological conditions only chang and chang 2006 used neuro fuzzy hybrid approach to construct a water level forecasting system during flood periods providing high accuracy and reliability for reservoir water level forecasting three hours ahead li et al 2016 developed an efficient model based on random forests rf to forecast water level variations of poyang lake in china adnan et al 2012 2013 proposed a novel extended kalman filter ekf optimization algorithm to overcome the nonlinearity problem of backpropagation neural network bpn and came out with an optimal ann for the prediction of flood water level three hours in advance using current values of rainfall at the flood location and three upstream locations of river water levels as input ruslan et al 2014 proposed flood water level modeling and prediction using nonlinear auto regressive with exogenous input narx model to overcome the nonlinearity problem and came out with an advanced neural network model for the prediction of flood water level 10 h in advance shiri et al 2016 proposed an extreme learning machine elm approach to predict the daily water level of urmia lake in iran and outcomes from the elm model were also compared with those of genetic programming gp and artificial neural networks zhang et al 2016 carried out a comprehensive comparison of anns support vector machine svm and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis on their applicability in particular short term i e hourly water level prediction under heavy rainfall events soleymani et al 2016 designed a novel method for prediction of water level named rbf ffa by utilizing fire fly algorithm ffa to train the radial basis function rbf and ffa is used to interpolate rbf to predict the best solution other studies on short term water level prediction can be found in recent works phitakwinai et al 2016 hou et al 2015 berkhahn et al 2019 guo et al 2019 in long term predictions the water level is predicted days weeks or months ahead and is mainly used to reveal the law of water level fluctuation for rivers reservoirs or lakes for example water level predicting performance of urmia lake located in the north west of iran were compared by using analytical linear statistic and intelligent methods and comparative results reveal that the intelligent methods are superior to traditional models for modeling lake level behavior as complex hydrological phenomena kakahaji et al 2013 sun and trevor 2018 proposed a framework based on multiple model combination methods mmcms for maximum breakup water level mbwl prediction during river ice breakup within the framework composed of member models and combining models the member models describe the relations between the mbwl predicted variable and their corresponding indicators predictor variables and the combining models link the relations between the mbwl predicted by each member model and the mbwl observed khan et al 2016 built an artificial neural network model using daily water flow and level data of 4 years 2010 2013 to predict discharges and water levels of the ramganga river catchment of the ganga basin in india other studies on long term water level prediction can be found in recent works yadav and eliza 2017 zaji and bonakdari 2018 ghorbani et al 2017 malekzadeh et al 2019 takehiko et al 2019 li et al 2019 neural networks such as multilayer perceptron mlp and recurrent neural network rnn are able to learn and model non linear and complex relationships which is really important because many of the relationships between inputs and outputs are non linear in real life mlp and rnn have been used in many areas seide et al 2011 cho et al 2014 miao et al 2015 and proved their ability to adress complicated non linear problems existing studies mainly focus on the water level prediction of a single reservoir or channel as far as we know most existing water level prediction work based on artificial intelligence use ann rf svm and other basic machine learning models to construct the prediction models however water level prediction is much more difficult for cascaded channels than for a single channel reservoir or lake the difficulties and challenges are that the water level of one channel is affected not only by itself but also by upstream channels and downstream channels not only by the last time step but also by time steps ahead traditional approaches have made great progress in water level prediction but may get into trouble to build a model with acceptable accuracy under this situation because the continuous water flow along the cascaded channels will bring about the propagation of hydrodynamic features in space and time to address these difficulties and challenges we adopt mlp and rnn to build two prediction models with satisfying prediction accuracy mlp based water level prediction mwlp and rnn based water level prediction rwlp our major contributions are threefold 1 spatial window and temporal window are proposed to augment the raw data of separate channel so that the augmented data containing the implicit spatial and temporal correlations can be utilized by our model directly 2 mlp and rnn are adopted to build the real time water level prediction model mwlp and rwlp for cascaded channels with high accuracy by mining the implicit correlation of hydrodynamic features among multiple channels in the spatial dimension and multiple data records in the temporal dimension 3 extensive experiments are carried out to compare the performances between our models and state of the art models on the case study of the south to north water diversion project snwdp experimental results show that our models outperform svm and ann by providing more satisfying prediction accuracy the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the overall methodology used in this work section 3 presents our two water level prediction models based on mlp and rnn in detail respectively section 4 shows the experimental results followed by conclusions and future work in section 5 2 methodology in the area of hydrologic and water resources research the water level in front of the gate is a very important hydrodynamic factor and is also the most intuitive and easiest data to observe for the actual water transmission and dispatching staff this paper mainly focuses on the prediction of the water level in front of the gate of cascaded channels the water level in front of cascaded channels is affected by the hydrodynamic data of the upstream channels and downstream channels at different times the schematic diagram of channels gates and other buildings is shown in fig 1 in order to simplify the model design and remove unnecessary noise we mainly consider those closely related hydrodynamic features such as water level in front of the gates the water level behind the gates number of gate holes open size of each gate hole gate flow and outlet flow the hydrodynamic features of each channel are recorded every two hours as shown in table 1 the meaning of each item is 1 date the date when the data was recorded 2 time the time when the data was recorded according to the scheduling experiences of our study case which will be detailed in the later sections 2 h is a reasonable interval to record the data so the value of time item increases in the unit of 2 h 3 water level in front of gate it s the value that our models want to predict and it s also the data label for model training it is measured by water level meters and recorded with centimeter as the unit as the measurements of water level meters may contain some errors and the water fluctuates in front of the gate the item takes an average value of several measurements around time 4 water level behind gate it s the water level behind the recorded gate and is also measured by water level meters with centimeter as unit 5 flow it s the water flow that go through the gate as a gate contains several gate holes whose number is presented in the item number of gate holes the flow here is the sum of flows of all gate holes it s recorded with the unit m 3 s 6 number of gate holes each gate contains 1 2 or 3 gate holes whose opening size may be different from each other 7 gate hole 1 gate hole 2 gate hole 3 these items are the opening sizes of gate holes the number of which is given in the item number of gate holes 8 outlet flow this item is the sum of flows of all the outlets in the upstream channel of the gate this item means the speed at which water are going out of the channel from outlets the unit of this item is m 3 s hydrodynamic features are propagated to the upstream and downstream channels with the flow of water and the hydrodynamic features of upstream and downstream channels at the current moment will affect the water level in front of the target gate moments later through the flow propagation across several channels to study the influence of different numbers and time steps of upstream and downstream channels on the prediction of the target channel water level 2 4 6 h ahead we build two prediction models 1 mlp based mwlp takes hydrodynamic features of multiple time steps of upstream and downstream channels as input and water level of the target gate for the next 2 4 6 h as output 2 rnn based rwlp is composed of similar inputs and outputs as mwlp but rwlp also makes use of the implicit nonlinear correlation features between different time steps of channels and achieve a little more satisfying accuracy 2 1 introduction to mlp mlp is called multi layer perceptron mlp allan 1999 the neural network layers of mlp can be classified into three types according to their locations input layer hidden layer and output layer generally speaking the first layer is the input layer the last layer is the output layer the middle layers between input layer and output layer are the hidden layers and the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each hidden layer will determine the model size and also affect the model fitting ability if the training data is sufficient layers are fully connected that is any neuron in layer i is connected to each neuron in layer i 1 mlp seems complicated but locally each neuron node performs the same operations as the perceptron i e a linear relationship plus an activation function suppose the weight between the mth neuron of i 1 th layer and the nth neuron at the ith layer is w mn i the bias of the nth neuron at the ith layer is b n i the number of neurons of the i 1 th layer is n i 1 the outputs of the i 1 th layer are a m i 1 m 1 2 n i 1 the activation function of the nth neuron of the ith layer is σ then the output of the nth neuron of the ith layer can be represented as 1 a n i σ m 1 n i 1 w mn i a m i 1 b n i there are many types of activation function σ i e sigmoid tanh relu nair and hinton 2010 russakovsky et al 2015 and leaky relu maas et al 2013 which are defined as 2 sigmoid x 1 1 e x 3 tanh x e x e x e x e x 4 relu x max 0 x 5 leakyrelu x max α x x where α is a very small constant it is due to the addition of nonlinear activation function in neuron computation that the whole neural network can learn arbitrary complex transformation relationship between input and output 2 2 introduction to rnn rnn is a special neural network structure proposed according to the viewpoint that human cognition is based on past experience and memory unlike mlp rnn not only takes into account the input of the previous moment but also gives the network a memory function of the previous content rnn has been widely used and has achieved great success in many fields such as speech recognition graves et al 2013 sak et al 2014 language translation cho et al 2014 jean et al 2014 image caption venugopalan et al 2015 sutskever et al 2014 and commodity recommendation han et al 2017 as shown in fig 2 rnn will remember the previous information and apply it to the calculation of the current output that is the nodes between the hidden layers are no longer disconnected but connected and the input of the hidden layer is not only from the input layer but also from the previous hidden layer suppose s t is the output of the hidden layer at time t x t is the input of rnn at time t o t is the output of rnn at time t w is the weight parameter between hidden layers u is the weight parameter between the input layer and the hidden layer v is the weight parameter between the hidden layer and the output layer the bias of the hidden layer is b the activation function of the hidden layer is σ the bias of the output layer is c the activation function of the output layer is η 6 s t σ ux t ws t 1 b 7 o t η vs t c then substitude equtation 6 into 7 over and over again the following formula can be obtained 8 o t η vs t c 9 η v σ ux t w σ ux t 1 w σ ux t 2 w σ ux t 3 from the formula 9 it can be seen that the output of rnn is affected by previous input values x t x t 1 x t 2 x t 3 which is also the reason why rnn can remember any number of input values many time steps ago the special memory function of rnn is closely related to the special structure of neurons in the hidden layer common hidden layer neurons include rnn long short term memory lstm gers et al 2000 lipton 2015 and gated recurrent unit gru chung et al 2014 whose neuronal structures are shown in fig 3 rnn neuron has only one activation function tanh which can also be relu or any other activation function and the problem of gradient disappearance will appear after using back propagation through time bptt algorithm for multiple time steps training gradient explosion occurs when the relu activation function is used and there are eigenvalues greater than 1 in w therefore rnn neurons cannot be trained for a long time the appearance of lstm and gru neuron structures effectively solves the problem of gradient disappearance or gradient explosion lstm is a complex neuron node with various components such as input gate output gate and forgetting gate the pink circle inside lstm in fig 3 when x t input data of current time step h t 1 the output of lstm itself at last time step and c t 1 the output of adjacent lstm at last time step are inputted to the lstm at time step t these gates input gate output gate and forgetting gate determine how much information will be forgotten and how much will be adopted to build the outputs h t and c t of current time step when this kind of special structure and mechanism work together with the outer recurrence of recurrent neural network the back propagation gradient can flow for long durations to avoid the problem of gradient disappearance or gradient explosion gru achieves the same performance by utilizing its update gate and reset gate the pink circle inside gru in fig 3 in a similar way 3 model and algorithm in this section we describe in detail the two prediction models mwlp and rwlp including how data are augmented and how the models are constructed 3 1 mlp based prediction model mwlp to address the problem caused by the spread of hydrodynamic features through the flow of water we build a mlp based model that can utilize hydrodynamic features by training across multiple spatial dimensions and temporal dimensions and explore the implicit correlations between hydrodynamic features of multiple adjacent channels in continuous time steps first the observed hydrodynamic data of cascaded channels are preprocessed with three steps then the data is used to train the mwlp model with the back propagation algorithm finally the mwlp model can be used to predict water level 2 4 6 h ahead with satisfying accuracy 3 1 1 data preprocessing generally speaking the original hydrodynamic data of cascaded channels contain many files each one of which corresponds to one channel we take three steps to preprocess the raw data including augmentation reduction and shaping 1 augmentation in order to get the maximum spatial temporal correlation of hydrodynamic features the concepts of spatial window and temporal window are proposed spatial window is mainly used to assemble multiple adjacent channels participating in model training in space and temporal window is mainly used to assemble multiple adjacent time slices participating in model training in time as shown in fig 4 the joint spatial window and temporal window effectively augment the training data set for example if the original channel has 19704 time steps of data and each data is composed of 8 features then the total data size is 19704 8 when spatial window size is 5 and temporal window size is 6 the total training data size is enlarged to 118224 40 the data size is enlarged by 30 times and the augmented data contains the spatial temporal correlation of hydrodynamic features generated by water flow propagation that was not contained in the original data of a single channel the data augmentation here is not a physical expansion but one kind of feature reusing as the data and useful features that can be obtained from the actual water diversion project are limited this kind of data augmentation is very useful for our model training which is also very popular in deep learning it can improve the model performances which will be shown in the section of model training and evaluation 2 reduction the augmented spatial temporal data cannot be directly used for model training the reason is that the water level prediction we make is under the condition that the gate opening does not change during the prediction period this means that we need to screen out the training data collected when the gate holes remains unchanged during this period as shown in fig 5 the size of spatial window is w h the size of temporal window is w v the sequence numbers of all gate holes in spatial window w h is stored in the set k and the data set of each window is represented by d w h w v then the earliest data is at the top and the most recent data is at the bottom starting with the first data slide the window down one slice at a time after each swipe check whether the data set in the window meets the following conditions k k i j w v d ik d jk where d ik means the data at the ith row and the kth column of d w h w v and d jk means the data at the jth row and the kth column of d w h w v only when the above conditions are met the current window data set d w h w v is used as a piece of training data and the target channel water level of 1 2 3 time slices after the first time slice of current window corresponding to the next 2 4 6 h respectively is added as the training data label at the end of the data if w v 3 then the reduction will finish normally if w v 3 then the reduction must finish at the third data from the bottom 3 pieces of data are used to generate labels for training it means max w v 3 data must be left for the last reduction operation 3 shaping since the input of mwlp model is a one dimensional vector and the augmented data set using spatial window and temporal window is a two dimensional matrix it is necessary to flatten the above data set into a one dimensional vector all timestamps in fig 5 are removed during shaping because they do not contain any useful information in addition to accelerate the convergence speed of parameter optimization algorithm and improve the prediction accuracy we use the following normalization procedure for each one dimensional vector of the input data x norm x μ δ where μ and δ are the mean and standard deviation of hydrodynamic features in the dimension x respectively after data preprocessing the dimension of the input data vector is w h w v 8 which is determined by the spatial window size w h and the temporal window size w v when choosing the values for w h and w v there is a tradeoff between the model complexity and accuracy which will be discussed in detail in the later section of model training and evaluation the output of the model is a vector containing 3 values water level predictions 2 h ahead 4 h ahead and 6 h ahead 3 1 2 mwlp model architecture to choose a suitable model structure for mwlp we adopt the corrected akaike information criterion caic sugiura 1978 as the evaluation criteria for models with different numbers of layers and neurons as follows caic n ln 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 2 k 2 k k 1 n k 1 where k is the number of parameters of the model n is the number of training samples y i is the observed water level and y i is the predicted water level by the model we conduct the model evaluation experiment and get the caic values for models with different structure and size as shown in table 2 it can be found the mwlp model with one hidden layer 1024 neurons achieves the lowest caic when the number of neurons in the first layer is less than 1024 the less the neurons the larger the caic value which may be caused by the large sum square of residue due to the weak approximation ability of the model when the number of neurons in the first layer is more than 1024 the more the neurons the larger the caic value which may be caused by the large k due to the over parameterization of the model so the model architecture of mwlp is built with one hidden layer 1024 neurons as shown in fig 6 it includes one input layer one hidden layer and one output layer respectively the input layer receives the one dimensional vector data d n i 1 i 2 i 3 i n 1 i n after the propagation calculation of the middle hidden layer the predicted water level for the next 2 4 6 h is obtained in the output layer as shown in fig 6 each channel has a designed water level and the actual water level was observed to fluctuate around the designed water level so in order to integrate the scheduling experiences into the model the loss function l mse θ of mwlp is designed as follows 10 l mse mwlp θ α i 1 n y y θ 2 1 α i 1 n y d y θ 2 n where θ is the set of network parameters of the mwlp model n is the batch size of training data y is the observed water level in front of the channel gate y is the predicted water level y d is the designed water level and α is a positive coefficient that is close to one objective function j θ for parameter optimization is as follows 11 j mwlp θ l mse mwlp θ λ 2 n θ θ 2 12 α i 1 n y y θ 2 1 α i 1 n y d y θ 2 n λ 2 n θ θ 2 where λ is the hyperparameter of l 2 regular item which is added to avoid model over fitting by limiting too large parameters and the meaning of other parameters are the same as those in eq 10 the hyperparameters of mwlp are shown in table 3 3 2 rnn based prediction model rwlp water level prediction based on historical data is a typical time series prediction rnn such as lstm and gru has the ability of historical memory and has been deeply studied and widely applied in many fields such as text translation speech recognition and commodity recommendation this paper adopts rnn to build our rwlp model to predict the water level of cascaded channels multiple time steps ahead compared with various existing methods based on ann svm or rf rwlp model has natural advantages in improving the accuracy and reliability of model prediction 3 2 1 data preprocessing similar to mwlp of the previous section the spatial window w h and the temporal window w v are also adopted in the data preprocessing of rwlp the difference is that in the process of rnn expansion each time slice outputs a predicted value as shown in fig 2 therefore when preprocessing data for rwlp we need to add the water level in front of the gate of multiple time slices into the training data set as labels according to the temporal window w v and the predicted timesteps w p as shown in fig 7 each training data of rwlp is composed of w h data which can be regarded as a data matrix and represented by d w v w h 1 each line of d w v w h 1 is composed of hydrodynamic features with width w v and a channel water level value as a label and the temporal distance between this label and the hydrodynamic features is w p similarly in order to accelerate the convergence of the model parameter optimization algorithm and improve the prediction accuracy of the model all data are normalized before data preparation and after the predicted value is obtained the inverse operation is carried out to generate the channel water level in front of the gate 3 2 2 rwlp model architecture each neuron in the hidden layer of the rwlp model has the function of memory therefore from the perspective of structure the rnn based model includes the input layer the hidden layer and the output layer as shown in fig 8 the hidden layer has n hidden units and the data dimension of the input layer is w h limited by space we only present the network structure diagram containing one hidden layer in the experimental comparison part of the following chapter we will compare and analyze the influence of different hidden layers on the prediction accuracy of the model for each training data d w v w h 1 our rwlp model will run w v time steps due to the recurrent structure of rnn as shown in fig 2 for any time step t t 1 2 w v the first w h hydrodynamic features of d t w h 1 correspond to x t 1 x t 2 x t w h in fig 8 after the forward propagation the network output y t w p of the tth timestep can be obtained as presented in equtation 13 and 14 13 s t σ w t i x t w t h s t 1 b h 14 y t w p w t o s t b o where w t i w t o w t h b h b o represent the input layer parameter matrix output layer parameter vector hidden layer parameter matrix hidden layer node bias vector and output node bias value of the tth time step respectively our rwlp model is based on the hydrodynamic feature of the first w v time slices to predict the target channel water level w p time slices ahead that is to say the output y w v w p of the last timestep in fig 8 is the predicted water level in front of the target gate however in order to improve the training efficiency and prediction accuracy of rwlp we take the deviations between the predicted output value and the corresponding label of w v time steps as the component of the loss function at the same time scheduling experiences are integrated into our model by modifying the loss function of rnn as follows 15 l mse rwlp θ 1 n i 1 n 1 w v t 1 w v α y t w p i y t w p i θ 2 1 α y d y t w p i θ 2 where θ is the parameter set of the entire network model n is batch size w v is the temporal window size of a training sample data i e the number of time steps y t w p i is the actual value of the tth time step of the ith instance y t w p i is the predicted value of the tth time step of the ith instance y d is the designed water level and α is a positive coefficient that is close to one then the objective function of parameters to be optimized is 16 j

into the objective function to avoid over fitting of the rwlp model by limiting too many or too large parameters the training process of rwlp model is shown in algorithm1 algorithm 1 rwlp model

rnn with combinations of different spatial windows and temporal windows data sets d w h w v 1 with different sizes are constructed and neural network models with different hidden layers and nodes are built in the cases of different combinations of w h and w v the network parameter differences are mainly reflected in the number of input nodes the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes in each hidden layer while other hyperparameters are the same limited by space we only give the neural network hyperparameters of the rwlp model with 1 hidden layer as shown in table 4 4 study area china is a country with a large population and limited water resources and the distribution of water resources is very uneven southern water resources are far more than the northern water resources geng et al 2001 wang and jin 2006 south to north water diversion project snwdp launched in 2002 has effectively alleviated the problem of uneven distribution of water resources in the north and south as shown in fig 9 the middle route of snwdp has diverted a large amounts of water from danjiangkou reservoir in hubei province to many important northern provinces and cities such as henan hebei tianjin and beijing which effectively alleviates the water shortage in these cities berrittella et al 2006 zhang 2009 zhang et al 2009 webber et al 2017 the water diversion distance of the middle route project is over 1200 km and more than 60 large gates are located along the route the controls over gates are closely related and it is also very important and extremely difficult to keep the water level stable among all gates along the route if the water level in any channel is out of control it will affect the normal operation and safe water supply of the whole line and even destroy the channel dam causing great harm to the lives and property of the local people along the route therefore it is of great social value to study the regulation of gate operation of snwdp to scientifically and reasonably predict the change trend of water level in all channels and to provide early warning and intervention of water level in channels so as to guarantee the normal production and domestic water supply of all cities along the route sdwdp started to run in 2014 after 12 years construction larson 2014 during the actual running of snwdp important hydrodynamic features such as the gate opening size channel water level in front of the gate channel water level behind the gate and flow rate are recorded every two hours with nearly 5 years of running a large number of actual hydrodynamic features in various climates and running conditions have been accumulated 19704 pieces of data 1 1 2015 30 6 2019 are used to train and test our models data are cleaned with the strategy that blank or singular values are filled with values of previous timestep in order to ensure the reasonability of the tests for our models we employ two schemes to sample the test data stratified sampling and k fold cross validation first according to the scheduling experiences of workers at snwdp the recorded data of each year belongs to 3 categories water rich period water normal period and water poor period so we make use of stratified sampling to sort each data into one of the 3 categories second inside each category k fold cross validation is used to sample test data and k is set as 10 in our experiments so the ratios of test samples are 10 both for each category and the full recorded data 5 model training and evaluation 5 1 evaluation criteria in order to achieve the optimum model structure and evaluate the performance of different models several criteria are employed as following 1 pearson correlation coefficient pcc is used to represent the degree of linear correlation between two random variables as pcc is the most popular measurement for correlation coefficient cc is used here for short we use cc to measure the degree of linear correlation between the predicted value of the model and the actual value as is presented below 18 corr y y cov x y σ x σ y 19 i 1 n y i μ y i y i μ y i 1 n y i μ y 2 i 1 n y i μ y 2 where y i represents the predicted value y i represents the observed value μ y represents the mean of predictions μ y represents the mean of observations and n represents the number of samples 2 root mean square error rmse makes an excellent general purpose error metric for numerical predictions compared to the similar mean absolute error rmse amplifies and severely punishes large errors and the equation is 20 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 where the meanings of y i y i and n are the same as the above 3 mean absolute error mae is the average of absolute errors which can better reflect the actual situation of predicted errors the lower the mae value the better the prediction effect and the equation is written as 21 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i where the meanings of y i y i and n are the same as the above 4 nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse is used to assess the predictive power of our models which is defined as 22 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y y i 2 where the meanings of y i y i and n are the same as the above y is the mean of observations nse can range from to 1 nse 1 corresponds to a perfect match of the predictions to the observations nse 0 indicates that the predictions are as accurate as the mean of the observations nse 0 indicates that the predictions are worse than the mean of observations 5 persistence index pi measures the relative magnitude of the variance of errors between predictions and observations to the variance of the errors obtained by the use of a simple persistence model which is defined as 23 pi 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i 1 y i 2 the optimalvalue of pi is 1 and pi should be larger than 0 to indicate minimally acceptable performance levels the simple persistence model represents a minimal information situation where it is assumed that the best prediction for the next time step is the observation at the current time step the combination of these metrics can evaluate the performance of our model from different aspects mae evaluates the performance in a common way rmse does it by enlarging the effect of abnormal predictions and pcc cc does it by reflecting the trend of the prediction values compared with the observed values nse compares the performance of our model with that of the mean observation pi evaluates our model s performance by comparing it with a persistent model the observation of the previous time step so the experimental results can be more comprehensively evaluated and the advantages of our model can be more persuasive 5 2 results and analysis of mwlp model in order to compare the effect of different adjacent channel number and different continuous time slice number on the prediction of mwlp model we test each evaluation metric with combinations of different channels and time slices as shown in table 5 and the deviation between the prediction and the observation as shown in fig 10 mwlp hm vn represents the mwlp model constructed by using hydrodynamic features of m adjacent upstream and downstream channels and n continuous time slices as training data in order to analyze the influence of different spatial window size and temporal window size on the prediction performance of mwlp more comprehensively we increase the spatial window size and temporal window size from 1 to 10 and compare the rmses of the models due to space limitation here we only give the rmse of mwlp for 6 h prediction as shown in fig 11 when the spatial window size and temporal window size increase at initial the rmse of mwlp drops rapidly however when the spatial window increases to 4 and the temporal window increases to 3 the rmse declines more and more slowly and in a few cases the rmse value fluctuates such as h 4 and v 8 h 9 and v 7 it can be seen from table 5 that increasing the size of the spatial window or the size of the temporal window can improve the accuracy of the water level in front of the gate predicted by the model but as the size of the spatial window or the temporal window increases rmse and mae of mwlp do not decline rapidly as before especially for the prediction 2 h ahead mwlp h2 v3 has achieve acceptable performances it also should be noticed that pi for 2 h ahead is not very high which is mainly between 0 41 and 0 46 it may be caused by the reason that the observation of the water level 2 h later tends to be persistent with the current value so our prediction is only a little better than the persistence model used by pi metic but for predictions 6 h ahead pi is much higher and it means our model can provide a satisfying prediction accuracy compared with the persistence model it also can be seen from fig 10 that with the increase of spatial window and temporal window the accuracy is gradually improved but when the spatial window and temporal window increase from mwlp h2 v3 to mwlp h3 v4 the accuracy is not improved as significantly as that from mwlp h1 v2 to mwlp h2 v3 this is because when the size of the spatial window and temporal window reaches 2 and 3 respectively both the spatial features of the two upstream and downstream channels and the temporal features of these five channels 6 h ahead are used to predict the water level in front of the gate mwlp has obtained enough hydrodynamic features and implied correlations and the accuracy of mwlp 2 4 6 h ahead has reached as high as 92 85 87 23 and 79 35 respectively with deviations less than 1 cm the input of more spatial temporal window features to mwlp is of little help to the improvement of the prediction accuracy 5 3 results and analysis of rwlp model in this section we experiment the rwlp model with different temporal and spacial windows with different kinds of neurons lstm gru rnn as hidden layer with different numbers of hidden layers in order to compare the effect of the different number of adjacent channels and continuous time slices on rwlp we test each evaluation metric with the different channel and time slice combinations as shown in table 6 and the deviation of the prediction from the observation as shown in fig 12 where lstm is used as the hidden neural unit in rwlp rwlp hm vn represents the rwlp model constructed by using hydrodynamic features of m adjacent upstream and downstream channels and n continuous time slices as training data the accuracy of water level prediction 2 h ahead is not significantly improved just by increasing the spatial window size and the temporal window size the reason is that the hydrodynamic features for two consecutive time slices and implied correlation that rwlp h1 v2 model gets is enough to predict the water level 2 h ahead and the hydrodynamic features of further channel or earlier time can not propagate to the target channel within 2 h so the increment of spatial window size or temporal window size can do no help for improvement of the accuracy 2 h ahead but we can see that the prediction accuracy 6 h ahead can be improved by enlarging the spatial window to 3 and temporal window to 4 similarly in order to more fully analyze the effect of spatial window size and temporal window size on the performance of rwlp we test and compare the rmse value of rwlp 6 h ahead when the spatial window size ranges from 1 to 10 and the temporal window size ranges from 2 to 11 as shown in fig 13 we can see that increasing the size of temporal window has less effect on the performance of rwlp than that of mwlp when the temporal window size reaches 4 rmse value of rwlp no longer drops significantly the reason for this could be that the memory function of rnn enables it to remember the feature information of multiple previous moments so it does not require too much temporal window to provide implicit time correlated features in addition we also compare the effects of using lstm and gru as hidden neural cells on the rwlp accuracy when the spatial window size and temporal window size are fixed with 2 and 3 respectively as shown in fig 14 whether lstm or gru is used as hidden neurons to predict the channel water level 2 4 6 h ahead there is little difference in accuracy this indicates that the memory functions of lstm and gru are similar in our prediction model we also experiment with the model using rnn as hidden layer neurons and find that the model can not be trained for long time steps due to the gradient disappearance or gradient explosion the performance comparisons of rmse are presented in table 7 and fig 15 it can be found that the rmse of rnn is much higher than that of lstm and gru and the rmses of lstm and gru are similar to each other so it s better to use lstm or gru as the hidden layer than rnn as the hidden layer as described in the section of rwlp model the number of hidden layers also has effects on the prediction accuracy especially when the spatial window and temporal window are large the dimension of each training data also increases at this time increasing the number of hidden layers with more parameters can improve the model fitting ability if the number of training data is enough as shown in fig 16 in the context of predicting the channel water level of 50th gate 6 h ahead with spatial window h 9 and temporal window v 5 when the number of hidden layer neurons lstm increases from 32 to 64 the accuracies with deviations less than 1 2 3 cm increase from 69 32 88 64 94 55 to 81 36 94 09 97 05 respectively when the number of hidden layer neurons is increased to 128 the evaluation metrics of the model hardly improves as the number of lstm layer neurons increases from 128 to 256 the accuracies with deviations less than 1 2 3 cm increase very little even decrease for deviation less than 1 cm from the above analysis we can find that rwlp model can obtain a relatively satisfying result when the spacial window is 2 and the temporal window is 3 lstm or gru is used as the hidden layer and the number of hidden layer is 128 5 4 performance comparison of different prediction models losts of researches based on ann and svm have focused on water level prediction of channel reservoir or lake and made great progress so we adopt these two kinds of approaches for comparison with our proposed model mwlp and rwlp here ann used for performance comparison is the neural network with the same structure one hidden layer with 1024 neurons as mwlp and is trained and tested with time delayed data a sliding time window with time lags 1 2 3 svm is implemented by using the nusvr api of scikit learn with nu 1 and kernel linear mwlp and rwlp used for performance comparisons are mwlp h2 v3 lstm h2 v3 and gru h2 v3 respectively mwlp h2 v3 is built with one hidden layer 1024 neurons and lstm h2 v3 gru h2 v3 is also built with one hidden layer 128 lstm gru neurons as shown in fig 17 and table 8 the accuracy of mwlp is significantly higher than that of svm although mwlp is implemented based on the neural network with the same size as ann mwlp adopts spatial window and temporal window in the preprocessing of input data to augment the hydrodynamic features mwlp is trained using the implicit hydrodynamic correlations between adjacent channels and continuous time slices that were not included in the ann model therefore mwlp can obtain a higher prediction accuracy than svm and ann similarly it can be found that the prediction accuracies of lstm h2 v3 and gru h2 v3 are higher than those of mwlp especially when predicting the water level 4 6 h ahead as shown in fig 18 we also compare the performances of svm ann mwlp h2 v3 lstm h2 v3 and gru h2 v3 for 6 h prediction in terms of rmse mae cc nse and pi respectively compared with svm the values of rmse mae cc nse and pi of mwlp h2 v3 are improved from 0 009837 0 008633 0 9855 0 9108 and 7 7025 to 0 006524 0 005455 0 9979 0 9949 and 0 75436 respectively which means the improvements are 33 67 36 81 1 26 and 8 41 for rmse mae cc and nse respectively the pi improvement of mwlp h2 v3 compared with svm is high and pi increase for a negative value 7 7025 to a positive value 0 75436 close to 1 similarly the rmse mae cc and nse improvements of lstm h2 v3 compared with svm are 34 78 44 53 1 32 9 198 respectively compared with ann the rmse mae cc and nse improvements of mwlp h2 v3 are 15 95 10 64 1 54 and 2 31 respectively and the improvements of lstm h2 v3 are 18 62 12 15 1 87 and 2 94 respectively compared with ann the pi also improves from 0 391 to 0 754 for mwlp h2 v3 and 0 761 for lstm h2 v3 respectively to compare these approaches from a modeling perspective caic is adopted again to evaluate the trade off between performance and simplicity of svm ann mwlp rwlp as shown in fig 19 although svm is the lightest model of the four models no more than ten thousand parameters it performs worst in terms of caic mainly due to its terrible prediction performances rwlp outperforms other models in terms of caic mainly because it can achieve high prediction performances as mwlp while keeping an acceptable model size no more than fifty thousand parameters mwlp outperforms ann a little because mwlp can achieve a slightly higher prediction accuracy than ann while keeping the same model size as ann so the experimental results suggest that rwlp is more suitable to apply in water level prediction of cascaded channels especially to apply in mobile devices with limited computing ability and memories by patrols along the channel 6 conclusions in this paper we propose two neural network models mwlp and rwlp to predict water level of cascaded channels 2 4 6 h ahead our two models can achieve satisfying accuracy due to their ability to mine the high dimensional correlated hydrodynamic features implied in the combinations of the spatial window and temporal window we have trained evaluated and tested the two models on the hydrodynamic data of the middle route of snwdp recorded in recent five years the experimental results show that the accuracies of mwlp 2 4 6 h ahead can reach as high as 92 85 87 23 and 79 35 with prediction deviation less than 1 cm and the accuracies of rwlp 2 4 6 h ahead can reach 93 16 90 82 and 87 73 due to the innate memory ability rwlp can achieve satisfying prediction performance while maintaining a acceptable model size compared with mwlp ann or svm based prediction approaches but we also find that the prediction deviations are higher than 5 cm for some extreme running conditions such as heavy rainy day and frozen day the reason is mainly that our models are built on the hydrodynamic features of the channels without any external data such as rainfall snowfall temperature and so on so our models perform poor under extreme weather conditions another problem to be solved is that a uniform model should be built to output the prediction for multiple channels at one time step without the need for building multiple models for the prediction of multiple channels future researches will focus on the water level prediction in extreme weather conditions and the building of a uniform model for multiple channels at one time step and also the attempting to make optimal controls for cascaded channels based on our prediction results declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
5579,it is critical important to accurately evaluate hydrological drought evolutions based on a composite index for the sustainable development of water resources in this study a nonlinear joint hydrological drought index njhdi is constructed by combining surface water and groundwater to better reflect the multivariate phenomenon in characterizing hydrological drought the bi dimensional copula function is applied to describe the complicated and nonlinear relationship between surface water and groundwater due to its dependence structure and flexibility to reflect the changes in underlying surface the time varying parameters are applied in the soil and water assessment tool swat model to simulate the surface water and groundwater more accurately based on the njhdi the spatio temporal hydrological drought evolutions as well as their potential influencing factors are analyzed in a case study of the yellow river basin yrb results indicate that 1 compared to the single hydrological index the njhdi is more sensitive and effective to capture historically droughts 2 hydrological droughts became increasingly serious during the last few decades especially in parts of the basin located in the loess plateau areas where the ecosystem is extremely fragile 3 climate and lulc changes have both contributed to the changes in hydrological droughts but their contributions vary significantly spatially in general the njhdi based hydrological drought evolution can provide more reliable information in hydrological drought decision making owing to considering changes in underlying land surface and combining the surface water and groundwater with nonlinear combination method keywords hydrological drought non linear joint index groundwater copula time varying parameters potential influencing factors 1 introduction drought a persistent and recurrent phenomenon is one of the most ecologically and economically disruptive natural hazard that impacts millions of people globally every year dai 2011 byakatonda et al 2018 it has imposed long lasting and remarkably adverse impacts on ecological and agro socioeconomic systems in the recent decades kim et al 2015 touma et al 2015 chang et al 2016 azmi et al 2016 and is also projected to become more severe and more frequent in the future due to the climate change and human activities such as land use land cover lulc variations drought can be generally categorized into meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts based on different types of deficits in the hydrological components among which the hydrological drought is one of the most closely associated with hydrologic cycle and acts as the most important link between meteorological and agricultural droughts huang et al 2016 therefore it is of great importance to scientifically investigate the hydrological drought evolution and explore its influencing factors such as climate and lulc changes which can help water resources managers to develop robust preparation plans to reduce the adverse impacts of droughts drought indices are essential tools of an efficient drought assessment monitoring and forecasting aimed at providing a concise overall picture of drought conditions for the research fields of hydrological droughts many indices have been developed over the years shiau et al 2007a b borgomeo et al 2015 wu et al 2018 such as the palmer hydrological drought severity index phdi palmer 1965 standardized runoff index sri wang et al 2011a b standardized streamflow index ssfi maity et al 2016 surface water supply index swsi shafer and dezman 1982 hao and singh 2015 it is not difficult to find that these indices are characterized by surface runoff or streamflow but neglect the changes in groundwater mishra and singh 2010 groundwater recharge and discharge plays an important role in the hydrological process groundwater amount level is a significant hydrological variable to characterize hydrological drought shahid et al 2010 li and rodell 2015 ottosen et al 2018 hence in recent years some hydrological drought indices based on groundwater resource status such as groundwater recharge and discharge groundwater water level or groundwater statistics have been proposed to characterize hydrological droughts for example mendicino et al 2008 presented a novel groundwater resource index gri to monitor and forecast hydrological drought conditions in a mediterranean region bloomfield and marchant 2013 constructed a new index of standardized groundwater level index sgi to characterize groundwater droughts li and rodell 2015 used the groundwater drought index gwi to assess groundwater drought in the central and northeastern of united states based on observations from nasa s gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission thomas et al 2017 constructed a new index of grace groundwater drought index ggdi to evaluate groundwater drought occurrence and quantify groundwater storage deficits in the central valley of california generally each index has its own strength and weakness as summarized in table 1 but from table 1 we can observed that current hydrological droughts only considers one variable of surface water or groundwater which could not be insufficient to characterize hydrological drought due to its multivariate phenomenon in other word hydrological drought is essentially a water imbalance in a hydrological system characterized by reductions in not only surface flow but also groundwater level and thus leads to abnormally low streamflow and low water storages in a lake or river nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 hao and aghakouchak 2013 zhai et al 2015 in natural conditions surface water is closely linked to groundwater with nearly linear relationship i e the increase or decrease of surface water is usually accompanied with the increase or decrease of groundwater hence hydrological droughts can be characterized by surface runoff or streamflow however in some cases the underlying land surface of a river basin may have been largely altered due to the human activities which directly affects the natural hydrologic cycle and may alter the linear relationship between surface water and groundwater for example han 2003 found that the large extent of overexploitation of groundwater in hai river huai river and yellow river basins of china has caused deeper unsaturated zones that seriously hindered the groundwater recharge from surface water manoj et al 2019 pointed out that the heavy overexploitation of groundwater would cut off the linkage between surface water and groundwater these phenomena are easy to cause groundwater recharge is independent of surface water so the interaction between surface water and groundwater becomes more complex and is often characterized by non linear relationship lischeid and bittersohl 2008 taie and koch 2019 manoj et al 2019 that is to say surface water is in a normal or even abundant status with groundwater in dry status or groundwater is abundant with the deficit in surface water therefore only using the surface flow or groundwater to construct a hydrological drought index obviously can t reflect the true hydrological drought conditions objectively and accurately therefore it is urgent and necessary to establish a composite index to reflect the complicated nonlinear hydrological drought phenomena currently numerous studies on constructing multivariate standardized drought index based on different methods have been published for example linear combination is a common method to combine different drought indices svoboda et al 2002 applied a linear weighted method to construct an objective blend of drought indicators obdi hao et al 2016 proposed a linearly combined drought index ldi to predict the drought in new york and california in the united states in addition some researchers also use the principal component analysis pca to construct the multivariate drought index keyantash and dracup 2004 applied the pca method to develop an aggregate drought index adi integrating the meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts entropy theory is also a way to construct the multivariate drought index rajsekhar et al 2015 constructed a multivariate drought index mdi based on entropy method waseem et al 2015 and chang et al 2016 also developed multivariate standardized drought indices using this method however multivariate standardized drought index constructed by the linear combination principal component analysis and entropy weight method all assume a linear relationship between different hydrological or drought indices which is obviously inconsistent with the reality mo and lettenmaier 2014 yang et al 2018 to solve this problem a copula function has been gaining popularity in recent years and is considered as an effective way to reflect the complicated and nonlinear relationship between multiple hydrologic variables hao and aghakouchak 2013 van de vyver and van den bergh 2018 wang et al 2019 fang et al 2019 therefore to better understand and characterize the variability and changes in hydrological droughts we construct a nonlinear joint hydrological drought index njhdi using copulas that takes into account both surface water and groundwater conditions as well as their nonlinear interaction in this study which is the main scientific innovation of this study accurate estimation of hydrological process such as surface water and groundwater is a challenging task given the spatial heterogeneity in terrain soil composition and changes in underlying surface due to the human activities huang et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 for example land surface characteristics usually represented by land use and land cover lulc can have significant influences on hydrological process by affecting rainfall infiltration overland and channel flows groundwater recharge and discharge and so on changing the underlying surface is thus one of the ways that human activities have altered the regional hydrological cycle in many places hence accurately reflecting the underlying surface characteristics is crucial for hydrological process simulation in recent year physically based distributed hydrological models such as soil and water assessment tool swat and variable infiltration capacity vic have been gaining popularity and are considered as effective ways to simulate complex hydrological process by calibrating model parameters which can reflect all the independent characteristics of underlying land surface for a watershed in an aggregated way zhang et al 2015 eum et al 2016 to properly reflect the changes in land surface characteristics and to ensure the accuracy of hydrological process simulation we use the approach of time varying model parameters for periods with different lulc conditions proposed by li et al 2019 to estimate the surface water and groundwater more accurately using swat model generally time varying parameters is that allows for different sets of model parameter values during different periods when the change significantly between periods when one lulc pattern can represent the overall characteristics of underlying land surface variation within a period we use a portion of that period for model calibration and the other portion for validation the detailed procedures in applying the time varying parameters in swat model can be referred to li et al 2019 this paper aims to develop a new hydrological index named nonlinear joint hydrological drought index njhdi to investigate the spatiotemporal variations in hydrological droughts scientifically and reasonably the njhdi contains three contributions addressing combining the surface water and the groundwater considering the nonlinear interaction between surface water and groundwater and reflecting changes in underlying land surface the rest of the paper is organized as follows the case study area is introduced in section 2 the methodology and data sources are presented in section 3 and then followed by results and analysis in section 4 section 5 draws the conclusions and discusses the limitation of our study 2 case study and datasets 2 1 a case study of the yellow river basin this study focuses on the yellow river basin yrb which is the second largest river in china and the sixth largest river in the world with a length of 5464 km fig 1 it is located in the central and north china with a drainage area of 795 000 km2 and it meanders through nine provinces from upstream to downstream addressing qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia neimeng shanxi shaanxi henan and shandong provinces and across the tibet plateau the loess plateau and the north china plain before entering into the eastern china sea the yellow river flows north turns south and then bends east before debouching into the ocean the climatic and topographic characteristics varies widely between different parts of the yrb the mean annual precipitation ranges from 123 to 1021 mm increasing from the northwest towards the southeast the mean annual temperature is approximately 4 to 14 c varying with both latitude and elevation zhang et al 2015 guo et al 2019 to analyze the spatial hydrological drought characteristics the study area is divided into six zones which are mainly based on the different climatic and topographic characteristics in the yrb fig 1 zone a is the source area of the yellow river and mainly locates in the qinghai tibet plateau which runs through the paleobasins and hills between bayan kara mountains and jishishan mountains and it is one of the most sensitive regions to climate change in the world hence zone a belongs to the plateau climate region and semi arid and semi humid region zone b is the region from tangnaihai to lanzhou section and two key reservoirs longyangxia and liujiaxia are located in this region the temperature in zone b is warmer than that in zone a so it belongs to the transition zone between plateau climate zone and mid temperate zone zone c ningxia inner mongolia reach is from lanzhou to toudaoguan section which is the main water consuming and disaster prone area of the yrb it is located in the loess plateau and flows through the valley basin and hetao plain the flow velocity is relatively slow and the precipitation is relatively low in this region it belongs to the arid and semi arid zone in the middle temperate zone zone d wei river basin also located in the loess plateau area is the largest tributary of the yrb it is one of the main sources of sediment in the lower reaches of the yellow river due to the serious soil erosion in this region and zone d belongs to the warm temperate semi arid zone zone e has good conditions of runoff yield and concentration with high stream gradient and many tributaries in this region two other key reservoirs sanmenxia and xiaolangdi are located in this area however this region is prone to occur rainstorms and torrential rains in summer in since it belongs to temperate continental climate and semi arid and semi humid zone zone f is the lower reach of yrb below the huayuankou section it is located in the north china plain where the precipitation is relatively sufficient but the runoff yield condition is relatively poor with serious sediment deposition and it belongs to temperate monsoon climate and humid zone the yrb has long been regarded as the mother river of china it provides domestic water supply for about 140 million people in more than 50 large and medium sized cities and it provides water supply for agricultural irrigation over approximately 1 6 105 km2 cropland that accounts for about 15 of the total irrigated land in china however the yrb has historically been experiencing frequently hydrological droughts which deeply influenced the chinese civilization from the ancient times to the present wu et al 2018 chang et al 2016 for example one of worst hydrological droughts that occurred in 1920s to early 1930s affected approximately 20 million people and over 3 million people died from starvation and related diseases huang et al 2015 in recent decades the yellow river has become a seasonal river and hydrological droughts have become more severe and frequent the most serious hydrological drought happened in 1997 when the downstream of yrb dried up for more than 226 days and more than 700 km of the river bed was exposed which had adverse impacts on ecological and agro socioeconomic systems cong et al 2009 currently there has been a number of studies on the hydrological drought in the yrb she and xia 2013 chang et al 2016 but none of them considered the nonlinear relationship between surface water and groundwater or the changes in underlying land surfaces therefore the yrb is selected as a case study to thoroughly investigate drought evolution characteristics using the nonlinear joint hydrological drought index njhdi and the results can help to prevent and mitigate the hydrological droughts in the yrb 2 2 datasets to support model calibration and simulations a number of datasets are used in this study the elevation data is extracted from nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem with a resolution ratio of 30 m the soil map 1 1 000 000 fig 2 and lulc data 1 100 000 for three periods 1980 2000 and 2010 fig 2 are obtained from data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn meteorological data including daily maximum and minimum temperature precipitation humidity solar radiation and wind speed from 1966 to 2010 at 121 weather stations claret colored dots in fig 1 are available from the national climate center of china in this study naturalized monthly streamflow from 1960 to 2010 at five hydrological stations green dots in fig 1 are obtained from the yellow river conservancy commission and they are used to calibrate and validate the swat model here the naturalized streamflow is the observed hydrological stream flow plus the water use quantity i e the naturalized streamflow has eliminated the influence of direct human activities on it such as reservoir storage irrigation industrial domestic and agricultural water consumption the average annual groundwater resources from 1980 to 2000 in eight subzones based on the secondary basin boundary http www geodata cn portal metadata viewmetadata jsp id 210008 10263 are obtained from the comprehensive planning of water resources cpwr in the yrb which is provided by the yellow river water conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources and the groundwater resources mainly refer to shallow groundwater which is a dynamic water quantity participating in water cycle and renewable year by year 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological modeling 3 1 1 the swat model many watershed scale distributed hydrological models have been developed in recent years jiao et al 2017 the soil and water assessment tool swat one of the most suitable models for simulating hydrological process such as surface and groundwater under the changing environment arnold et al 1998 woldesenbet et al 2017 li et al 2019 taie and koch 2019 was applied in the yrb to simulate the surface water and groundwater in this study based on the digital elevation model dem and the channel network the yrb was divided into 381 sub basins ranging from 6 to 12 176 km2 then they were further divided into smaller hydrologic response units hrus based on the dominant land use soil type and slope using lulc maps in 1980 2000 and 2010 the yrb was divided into 1749 1755 and 1753 hrus respectively 3 1 2 time varying model parameters for periods with different lulc conditions here we use the approach that allows for different sets of model parameters during different periods when the underlying land surface characteristics change li et al 2019 for a given period when there is no any significant change in lulc we use one part of this period for model calibration and the other part for model validation since there are three lulc maps we conducted calibration in all three periods represented by three lulc maps we conducted the change point analysis with mann kendell trend test on the naturalized streamflow time series from 1960 to 2010 at five hydrological stations the results showed that there was one change point in the naturalized streamflow time series that occurred in 1990 the change is likely associated with regional environment changes including climate and lulc hence the period before 1990 is referred to as the period when both climate and lulc changes were still minimal and the period after 1990 is referred to as the period when both climate and lulc changes were significant enough to have altered the hydrological cycle in the region therefore in this study we divided the entire study period 1966 2010 into baseline period 1966 1990 and impact period 1991 2010 the impact period is further divided into two decades 1991 2000 and 2001 2010 as the lulc changes are more pronounced in the second decade which will be facilitated and supported by the lulc change characteristics discussed later in section 4 1 the performance of swat can be evaluated by three criteria the nashsutcliffe coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 and percentage of bias pbias gupta et al 1999 the ns is widely used in hydrology assessment to measure the goodness of fit between the observations and simulations the performances of swat model are considered satisfied adequate and very good when ns ranges from 0 5 to 0 54 from 0 55 to 0 65 and are larger than 0 65 respectively moriasi et al 2007 the r2 indicates the correlation between two series and ranges from 0 to 1 ideal moriasi et al 2007 the pbias represents the average deviation of the simulations from the observations a negative positive pbias value suggests that the simulations underestimate overestimate the observations the swat model performance is satisfactory when the absolute value of pbias ranges from 15 to 25 good when the absolute value of pbias ranges from 10 to 15 and very good when the absolute value of pbias is smaller than 10 and 0 is the ideal one moriasi et al 2007 overall according to moriasi et al 2007 the performance of the swat model at the monthly scale can be considered satisfactory if ns 0 5 r2 0 6 and pbias 25 when the swat model parameters are calibrated well the hydrological process including rainfall infiltration runoff generation overland and channel flows can be well simulated hence the hydrological components in 381 sub basins can be obtained from the swat simulation results and the surface water and groundwater components in each zones are calculated by the weighted average method of surface water and groundwater in all sub basins accordingly since the areas of sub basins are different 3 2 copula based joint hydrological drought deficit index to consider the changes in both surface water and groundwater as well as their nonlinear interaction during a hydrological drought a copula function was applied in this study to construct a new hydrological drought index named nonlinear joint hydrological drought index njhdi copula functions not only has the advantages of offering the flexibility to construct the joint distribution of random variables regardless of their marginal distributions but also has the abilities to accurately describe the nonlinear and asymmetric relationships between variables moriasi et al 2007 guo et al 2020 the framework of the njhdi was motivated by the commonly used standardized precipitation index spi through the joint distribution of surface water and groundwater to characterize the overall hydrological drought condition the procedure basically included 1 identifying marginal distributions of surface water and groundwater 2 selecting suitable copulas to obtain the cumulative joint probability of surface water and groundwater and 3 transforming the cumulative joint probability to the njhdi we describe the procedure in detail below 3 2 1 marginal distribution in this study three distributions i e the exponential distribution lognormal distribution and gamma distribution were applied to fit the marginal distributions of surface water and groundwater the specific procedures of these three distribution functions were described by kayid and izadkhah 2015 li et al 2015 and rohan et al 2015 respectively the akaike information criteria aic developed by akaike 1974 was applied to select the appropriate marginal distribution the formula of aic is as follows 1 aic 2 k n log 1 n i 1 n p e p t 2 where n is the sample size p e is the empirical frequency p t is the theoretical frequency k is the number of fitted parameters 3 2 2 joint probability distribution assuming surface water and groundwater as two random variables x and y the joint distribution with the cumulative joint probability p can be calculated with a copula function c as chang et al 2016 2 p x x y y c f x g x p where f x and g y are the marginal cumulative distributions of random variables x and y respectively a wide variety of copula families have been used to model different dependence structures of random variables among them the archimedean copulas are popular because the explicit functional forms are flexible and allow for differences in tail behavior for example the frank copula offers a symmetric dependence structure while gumbel and clayton copulas exhibit asymmetric dependence structures salvadori et al 2007 hence the archimedean copulas including frank clayton and gumbel hougaard copulas were selected to model the joint distribution between surface water and groundwater variables the frank copula for example can be expressed as chang et al 2016 3 c f x g x 1 θ ln 1 e θ f x 1 e θ g x 1 e θ 1 where θ is the parameter and f x and g y are the marginal cumulative probabilities of surface water and groundwater respectively in this study the nonparametric estimation method that was put forward by genest and rivest 1993 was used to estimate copula parameters the parametric estimation by this method is mainly based on the relationships between the kendall rank correlation coefficient τ and corresponding copula parameter θ and the function is shown as follows 4 τ 1 4 θ 1 θ 0 t e t 1 d t 1 where t is the integration variable the selection of copula is also based on the minimum value of aic which was presented in section 3 2 1 for detailed descriptions of clayton and gumbel hougaard copula functions the interested reader can refer to chang et al 2016 3 2 3 the nonlinear joint hydrological drought deficit index based on the cumulative joint probability p expressed in eq 2 the nonlinear joint hydrological drought deficit index njhdi is defined as 5 njhdi f 1 p where f p is the standard normal distribution function eq 5 transforms the joint probability p to the njhdi that is in the same space as the spi hence the classification of drought severity with the njhdi can simply refer to the spi the thresholds corresponding to no drought abnormally dry moderate drought severe drought and extreme drought are shown in table 2 3 3 quantifying the spatiotemporal impacts on hydrological droughts to quantify the spatiotemporal impacts of climate and lulc changes on hydrological droughts in the yrb we conduct the following modelling experiments using swat model with different configurations described below other inputs such as dem and soil data are all kept fixed bl baseline simulation

f bl f ip f bl 100 7 p lulc f lc f bl f ip f bl 100 where f bl f cl f lc and f ip are the frequency of hydrological droughts in the experiments of bl lc cl ip respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 lulc change characteristics in the yrb the land use cover patterns in 1980 2000 and 2010 in the yrb are shown in fig 2 and the quantification of the area and associated changes of various lulc types between 1980 and 2010 is given in table 3 from table 3 it can be found that grassland and cropland were the two largest lulc types during the last three decades and they accounted for approximately 50 and 30 of the total area of the yrb but areas of these two major types reduced from 1980 to 2010 declining by 3465 km2 8 96 and 1901 km2 8 50 respectively build up area was from 18 105 km2 in 1980 to 21 952 km2 in 2010 which increased by 21 25 the increase in build up area mostly happened during 2000 2010 from 19 053 to 21 952 km2 with increasing by 15 22 due to the rapid urban development and expansion woodland increased from 106 426 to 109 011 km2 2 43 over the past three decades because of the government policy on forest protection the increase of water body in the last 10 years was largely due to the implementation of the grain for green project ggp by the government started in 1999 wang et al 2010 we use the lulc transition matrix to quantify the spatial transformations that took place among different lulc types in the yrb during the past few decades the lulc transition matrix has been widely applied to analyze and quantify lulc changes between different land use types wang et al 2010 ning et al 2018 the matrix not only contains the static lulc information but also includes abundant dynamic change information in a certain period the lulc transition matrix is usually presented as the following form a 1 1 a 1 2 a 1 n a 2 1 a 2 2 a 2 n a m 1 a m 2 a m n where a m n is the area of land cover type m that has been converted to land cover type n during the period of consideration and the detailed computational procedure can be found in wang et al 2010 based on lulc maps of 1980 2000 and 2010 the transition matrices are established between 1980 and 2000 and between 2000 and 2010 as shown in table 4 each value in the table is the area of the land cover type labeled with the row being converted to the land cover type labeled with the column it can be found that the spatiotemporal conversions of lulc types was bidirectional i e the conversion of one lulc type out to another was usually accompanied by other lulc types converting back into this type for example during the period of 1980 2000 high frequency transfer occurred among cropland and grassland cropland was mainly transformed into grassland while grassland was mainly converted to cropland with transfer areas of 4689 km2 and 1991 km2 respectively during the period of 2000 2010 high rate conversion occurred among cropland woodland and grassland cropland was mainly transformed into grassland woodland was mainly changed into cropland and grassland while grassland was mainly converted to cropland their transfer areas were 2334 km2 1576 km2 1581 km2 and 3810 km2 accordingly all of these data indicate that the underlying land surface characteristics of the yrb have changed significantly due to the human activities 4 2 model calibration and validation by time varying parameters the swat model was calibrated and validated for each of the periods separately for the baseline period the lulc map for 1980 was used to represent the land use pattern the years of 1966 and 1967 were used to spin up the model and the periods of 1968 1980 and 1981 1990 were used for model calibration and validation respectively for the impact periods the lulc maps for 2000 and 2010 were used to represent these two decades within each impact period the first six years of the record were used for model calibration and the last four years were used for model validation calibration and validation measured by the three metrics i e ns r2 and pbias were summarized in table 5 and it shows that the swat model is able to simulate the naturalized streamflow at all five hydrological stations reasonably well and the model performance is considered satisfactory to demonstrate and quantify the usefulness of time varying parameters in the swat model performance two sets of model simulations were conducted for the validation of two impact periods the simulations setups were identical except that in one used the model parameters obtained from the baseline period calibration while the other used parameters obtained from the calibration for the same period i e one was using the method of time varying parameters and the other one was using traditional method that the parameters were calibrated in the baseline period then the calibrated parameters were kept invariant remained the same as baseline parameters when simulating the hydrological process in the validation of two impact periods table 6 summarizes the comparison with the three metrics ns r2 and pbias it is clear that using the parameters obtained from baseline calibration the model performance was significantly degraded especially for the middle and downstream stations the numbers in bold indicate that the metrics fail to reach the minimum benchmark suggesting that the swat model running with the baseline parameters had unsatisfactory performance to model the streamflow during the impact period this is mainly due to the yrb especially in the middle and lower reaches has been significantly highly modified by human activities resulting in significant changes in underlying surface characteristics as shown in section 4 1 as we know the calibrated model parameters to a large extent compensate the model deficiencies and errors to best fit the observations during the calibration period thus their values are often dependent upon lulc patterns and underlying surface characteristics so it is implausible to assume the baseline parameters were still suitable under the new lulc conditions in the 1990s and 2000s while using the time varying parameters the model performance was considerably better with most of ns and r2 as high as 0 7 to 0 8 in addition the values of ns of both decades with time varying parameters were larger than those with baseline parameters which further verifies the time varying parameters can better characterize the underlying land surfaces more accurately furthermore to suggest the reliability of simulated groundwater in swat model with time varying parameters the average annual groundwater resources from 1980 to 2000 in eight subzones based on the secondary basin boundary fig 3 a were used to compare with the simulated groundwater in corresponding subzones and the results are shown in fig 3 b from fig 3 we can that the groundwater from swat model in these subzones show slightly larger than that of from cpwr with relative errors of lower than 10 which are primary caused by the inevitable model structure and input data accuracy therefore groundwater based on simulations from swat model with time varying parameters provides an alternative method to take forward the study of groundwater drought that is hindered by the lack of direct observations of groundwater over time and space 4 3 the constructed nonlinear joint hydrological drought index njhdi based on the procedures for deriving njhdi discussed in detail in section 3 3 the annual and seasonal njhdi in six zones are obtained since njhdi combines the joint deficit characteristics of surface water and groundwater as well as their connections it should show better properties to demonstrate the reliability of the constructed njhdi the standardized naturalized streamflow index ssfi and standardized groundwater index sgi are computed in six zones to compare with the constructed njhdi in yrb since zone d often suffered historical droughts since the 1990s huang et al 2014 chang et al 2016 the annual ssfi and njhdi covering 1990 2010 are plotted and shown in fig 4 it can be clearly observed from fig 4 that the njhdi time series has a high consistence with ssfi and sgi time series and their correlation coefficients are 0 69 and 0 68 respectively table 7 additionally their correlation coefficients in other five zones are also shown in table 6 and from table 7 we can also observe that njhdi has high correlation coefficients with ssfi and sgi within each zone which verifies the reliability of the constructed njhdi in addition the correlation coefficients in the upstream are larger than those in the middle and downstream the primary reason is that the linkage between the surface water and groundwater would be cut off since the underlying surface characteristics lulc characteristics of the middle and downstream of the yrb have been largely altered due to the intensive human activities to further demonstrate the value of the constructed njhdi the years when historical droughts occurred during 1990 2010 in the yrb are collected from earlier studies yrcc 2008 2010 these researches indicated that the yrb experienced extremedroughts in 1995 1997 2000 2007 and 2009 which almost mainly occurred in the shaanxi provinces hence we took zone d as an example to show the performance of the constructed njhdi on capturing droughts and from fig 4 we can clearly see that these five droughts in zone d were all captured by njhdi while only three droughts were captured by ssfi and sgi taking the extreme drought year of 1997 as an example the yearly surface water in zone d was 179 mm while the groundwater was in a serious deficit status with only 29 mm so only considering the surface water or groundwater to characterize hydrological drought could not accurately reflect the hydrological drought condition and it is why jhdi is more sensitive and effective to capture historically droughts owing to taking into account changes in both surface water and groundwater similarly the comparative results in other five zones are the same as zone d and their relevant figures are not shown here due to the page limit in sum the constructed njhdi is a reliable index for hydrological drought assessment which can be adopted to scientifically investigate the hydrological drought evolution in the yrb 4 4 spatial temporal variability of hydrological droughts in the yrb 4 4 1 spatial variability of hydrological droughts in the yrb to investigate the most common drought category within each zone we examined the spatial variability of hydrological drought in the yrb with a focus on the frequency of hydrological droughts at different severity categories throughout the whole study period of 1968 2010 based on the annual njhdi the spatial distribution of drought frequency at different categories was exhibited in fig 5 it can be observed that the annual hydrological drought frequencies for different categories have a noticeable spatial differences and for the same drought severity category the frequencies are also quite different for different zones within the yrb in general the middle and downstream of the yrb had more severity categories with higher frequencies than the upstream mainly zone a and zone b indicating that the annual hydrological drought risk in the middle and downstream was higher than the upstream of the yrb for example zone a experienced abnormally dry and moderate drought conditions more often than other zones and zones b more often experienced moderate drought than others but zone c and zone e were more likely to occur severe droughts and zone f was more prone to occur severe and extreme droughts in particular zone d was most likely to experienced extreme drought with the highestfrequency of 41 50 in the past 43 years which indicated that when hydrological droughts occurred in zone d their severities were easily escalated to the extreme drought category to explain the spatial differences of hydrological droughts at the year timescale the annual average surface water and groundwater are summarized in zone a least often extreme droughts and zone d most often extreme droughts the results show that the annual average surface water in zone a and zone d had little differences with 219 mm and 207 mm respectively while the groundwater showed noticeable differences with 151 mm in zone a but 60 mm in zone d from fig 5 we know that zone a had the lowest frequency to occur extreme drought while zone d had the highest frequency to occur extreme drought in the last 43 years and as emphasized in this article hydrological drought is essentially a water imbalance in a hydrological system characterized by reductions in not only surface water but groundwater so when little difference of surface water 12 mm was observed in zone a and zone d the great difference of occurring extreme droughts between zone a and zone d was mainly ascribed to the noticeable difference of groundwater with 91 mm hence the deficit in groundwater in zone d was the main reason that resulted in the high frequency of extreme droughts occurred in this region which also in turn verifies that the significant role of groundwater variable on characterizing watershed hydrological drought in addition to examine the spatial distribution features of the hydrological drought in the yrb at the year timescale we also analyzed its spatial distribution characteristics at the season timescale using the average seasonal njhdi for the period of 1968 2010 the spatial distributions of hydrological drought frequency in different seasons are shown in fig 6 we can see that the hydrological drought was the least severe with the lowest risk in summer compared to the summer the hydrological drought was more severe in spring with higher risk and that in winter was the most severe especially in the middle and down streams of the yrb the results are similar to the of finding of huang 2015 which further proves that the hydrological drought assessment based on the constructed njhdi in present study is reasonable and reliable in the yrb to further investigate what kind of drought category is most likely to occur during the winter in each zone the spatial distribution of hydrological drought frequency at different categories is exhibited in fig 7 and from fig 7 we can clearly observe that zone a and zone b experienced moderate drought conditions more often than other zones and zone c and zone f were more likely to occur severe droughts than others while zone d and zone e were more prone to occur extreme droughts similar to the annual hydrological drought characteristics zone d was most likely to experience extreme drought in winter with the highestfrequency of 51 60 also the average winter surface water and groundwater in zone a least often extreme droughts and zone d most often extreme droughts are also take as the examples to explain this phenomenon and the results show that little difference exists in winter surface water between zone a 54 mm and zone d 51 mm while the winter groundwater in zone d 15 mm is much smaller than that in zone a 37 mm so it can be concluded that when hydrological droughts occurred in zone d whether within the year or winter their severities are easily escalated to the extreme drought category mainly due to the deficit in groundwater which in turn confirms the significant importance of the groundwater variation when characterizing hydrological droughts 4 4 2 temporal variability of hydrological droughts in the yrb fig 8 reveals the changes in annual hydrological drought frequency over time above the severe drought category i e including severe drought and extreme drought these are the categories that can have the most serious impact on agriculture ecosystems and environment generally these types of droughts became more frequent in recent decades during the baseline period the whole basin experienced severe or extreme droughts with a low frequency within 15 the likelihood for having a severe drought or extreme hydrological drought is small for the entire basin at that time in the 1990s the frequency for having a severe drought or extreme drought year increased for zones b d e and f especially for zone d with the highest hydrological drought frequency of 86 100 indicating that zone d is the most frail place to experience these two types of droughts in the 1990s then in the 2000s the frequency decreased in zones d and f implying that zones d and f had a certain tendency toward wet and the drought risks for these two categories tended to reduce while the frequency increased significantly over zones c and e suggesting a much elevated drought risk in these regions fig 9 shows the changes of the annual average surface water and groundwater in each zone in 1990s and 2000s compared to the baseline period and from it we can see that the surface water kept decreasing but the groundwater kept increasing throughout the 1990s and 2000s which may explain why the hydrological drought frequency in zone a has no obvious change over time the surface water and groundwater in the b d e and f all show decreasing trends in the 1990s such as the dramatic declining in groundwater with 65 mm in the zone d which directly causes the high frequency of hydrological droughts in 1990s compared with the 1990s the groundwater in zone d and the surface water in zone f both has a certain recovery in the 2000s and this is the main reason that the drought risks for having severe drought or extreme droughts tended to reduce during the 2000s overall the risk for having a severe or extreme hydrological drought within the year in zones c and e increased over time due to the continuous decline of both surface water and groundwater the hydrological drought frequency in zones d increased in the 1990s mainly ascribing to the dramatic decrease of groundwater but that had a certain mitigation in the 2000s primarily owing to the recovery of the groundwater in some extent the recovery of the groundwater in zone d is mainly related to the implementation of soil and water conservation policy in the wei river basin with ecological and engineering measures in the late 1990s which has increased the areas of woodland and grassland and thus increasing the groundwater recharge from soil water since hydrological droughts were more frequent in winter in the past 40 years we also analyzed the temporal changes in hydrological drought frequency in this season above the severe drought category fig 10 similar to the annual drought change trend these two types of droughts became more frequent in winter in recent decades especially in zones c d and e where the frequency increased significantly in the 2000s during the baseline period zones a and f suffered a higher frequency of severe or extreme hydrological drought than other zones while the opportunity for having these two types of drought is slim in zones b and c at that time in the 1990s the frequency of a severe or extreme drought increased in zones c d and e but decreased in zones a and f implying that these two categories of hydrological drought in zones a and f had a certain mitigation then in the 2000s the frequency continued to increasing over zones c d and e suggesting a much elevated drought risk in these regions fig 11 shows the changes of the average surface water and groundwater in winter for each zone in 1990s and 2000s compared to the baseline period and from it we can see that the surface water and groundwater in zones a b and f compared to the baseline period have no significant changes while those in zones c d and e show significant decrease especially for the surface water that declined drastically which may be caused by the icing phenomenon due to the low temperature thus higher drought frequencies were observed in zones c d and e in winter in general the risk for having a severe or extreme hydrological droughts during the winter in zones a b and f maintained low frequency within 40 while that increased significantly over time in zones c d and e largely ascribing to the significant decline in surface water it is worth to mention that zones c d and e are primarily in the loess plateau where the ecosystem is extremely fragile extreme droughts can cause environmental degradation that is hard to recover posing serious challenges for natural resource management additionally many previous drought related studies in the yrb xie and fu 2004 shiau et al 2007a b she and xia 2013 xu et al 2014 also pointed out that the high drought risk in the loess plateau which is consistent with our findings in this study and thus once more confirms that the hydrological drought analysis with the constructed njhdi is reasonable and reliable in the yrb 4 5 impacts of climate and lulc changes on hydrological drought based on the procedures described in section 3 3 impacts of climate and lulc changes on hydrological drought frequency of most often drought category in each zone were quantified the changes in drought frequency between the baseline period and the impact period were calculated then attributed to either of the factors positive contribution shows that the factor either climate or lulc change helps to increase the drought frequency while negative contribution means it adversely reduce the drought risk the results of impacts of climate and lulc changes on annual and winter hydrological droughts are shown in tables 8 and 9 respectively from them we can see that the impacts of climate and lulc changes on hydrological drought were nonlinear and varied remarkably in space and time for example the lulc change dominated to aggravate the annual drought risks in zones c e and f while the climate change was the primary factor that aggravates the main hydrological drought category occurred in winter in zones a b d and f compared to the 1990s the impacts of climate changes were greater in the 2000s over zones a and b but smaller in over zones d and f this pattern primarily related to the climate and lulc change degrees in these zones during different periods compared to the baseline period the change degrees of lulc and climate mainly the precipitation and temperature in winter in these zones in the 1990s and 2000 s were calculated and the results are shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively from fig 12 it can be inferred that the shrinkage of water body and the expansion of build up might be the major driving forces to the reduction of surface water and groundwater respectively thus causing high frequency of most often drought categories in zones c e and f from fig 13 we can see that the change degree of average winter precipitation in zone a and zone b showed little difference between the 1990s and 2000s while the change degree of the average winter temperature in the 2000s were much higher than that in the 1990s which indicates that the sharp increases of winter temperature in the 2000s with 1 5 c in zone a and 0 9 c in zone b were the main reason that led the impact of climate change on hydrological droughts to be greater than that in the 1990s in zones a and b for zone d and f the average winter temperature in the 1990s and 2000s both increased by 1 2 c 1 5 c but the precipitation decreased in the 1990s while increased in the 2000s subsequently inferring that the average decrease of winter precipitation in the 1990s was the dominant factor that causes the impact of climate change on hydrological drought being greater than that in the 2000s 5 summaries and conclusion hydrological drought is essentially a water imbalance in a hydrological system characterized by reductions in surface water and groundwater hence using only surface water or groundwater to characterize hydrological drought may not accurately reflect the hydrological drought conditions especially in basins like the yellow river basin yrb where the subsurface hydrology is highly influenced by human activities therefore in this study we constructed a nonlinear joint hydrological drought index njhdi that takes into consideration of both surface water and groundwater conditions as well as their nonlinear interaction to better understand and characterize the variations and changes in hydrological droughts in the yrb furthermore to reflect the changes in underlying land surface on hydrological process we applied an alternative approach of time varying parameters by calibrating swat model for periods with different lulc conditions then based on these time varying parameters the surface and underground water at the year and season timescales in six zones of the yrb were accurately estimated and the corresponding njhdi for each zone was calculated by extending the spi through the joint distribution of surface and underground water using copula function based on the constructed njhdi the spatiotemporal variability of hydrological droughts were examined with a focus on the frequency of hydrological droughts at different severity categories then compared with the baseline period of 1968 1990 the impacts of climate and lulc changes on the most often drought category in each zone of the yrb were quantified the results show that njhdi is more sensitive and effective to capture historically droughts than ssfi and sgi owing to taking into account changes in changes in surface water groundwater interactions and changes in underlying land surface generally on the year timescale the middle and downstream of the yrb have more severe hydrological droughts with higher frequencies than the upstream seasonally the hydrological drought in winter is the most severe especially in the middle and downstream of the yrb exploring reasons climate change is the primary factor that aggravate the annual hydrological droughts for the upstream while lulc change is the main driving force in the middle and downstream mainly caused by the shrinkage of water body and the expansion of build up conversely the hydrological drought occurred in winter in the loess plateau zones c and e is primarily due to the lulc change while that occurred in other parts of the yrb is primarily ascribed to the climate change largely due to the decrease of precipitation in the 1990s and the increase of temperature in the 2000s during the winter period particularly when hydrological droughts occurred in zone d whether within the year or in winter their severities were easily escalated to the extreme drought category during the past four decades and the increased frequency for severe and extreme hydrological droughts over zone c in winter approximately as high as 80 100 in the last 10 years is alarming zones c and d are primarily in the loess plateau where the ecosystems are extremely fragile thus the environmental degradation caused by the extreme droughts in these two zones was hard to recover which posed serious challenges for natural resource management great efforts have been made to scientifically investigate the hydrological drought evolution based on the constructed nonlinear joint hydrological drought index njhdi in this study while it still has limitation the present study mainly focuses on the impacts of climate and lulc changes on hydrological droughts but neglects the influence of artificial water consumption e g reservoir storage irrigation industrial domestic and agricultural water consumption on hydrological droughts which will be pursued in our future study

5579,it is critical important to accurately evaluate hydrological drought evolutions based on a composite index for the sustainable development of water resources in this study a nonlinear joint hydrological drought index njhdi is constructed by combining surface water and groundwater to better reflect the multivariate phenomenon in characterizing hydrological drought the bi dimensional copula function is applied to describe the complicated and nonlinear relationship between surface water and groundwater due to its dependence structure and flexibility to reflect the changes in underlying surface the time varying parameters are applied in the soil and water assessment tool swat model to simulate the surface water and groundwater more accurately based on the njhdi the spatio temporal hydrological drought evolutions as well as their potential influencing factors are analyzed in a case study of the yellow river basin yrb results indicate that 1 compared to the single hydrological index the njhdi is more sensitive and effective to capture historically droughts 2 hydrological droughts became increasingly serious during the last few decades especially in parts of the basin located in the loess plateau areas where the ecosystem is extremely fragile 3 climate and lulc changes have both contributed to the changes in hydrological droughts but their contributions vary significantly spatially in general the njhdi based hydrological drought evolution can provide more reliable information in hydrological drought decision making owing to considering changes in underlying land surface and combining the surface water and groundwater with nonlinear combination method keywords hydrological drought non linear joint index groundwater copula time varying parameters potential influencing factors 1 introduction drought a persistent and recurrent phenomenon is one of the most ecologically and economically disruptive natural hazard that impacts millions of people globally every year dai 2011 byakatonda et al 2018 it has imposed long lasting and remarkably adverse impacts on ecological and agro socioeconomic systems in the recent decades kim et al 2015 touma et al 2015 chang et al 2016 azmi et al 2016 and is also projected to become more severe and more frequent in the future due to the climate change and human activities such as land use land cover lulc variations drought can be generally categorized into meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts based on different types of deficits in the hydrological components among which the hydrological drought is one of the most closely associated with hydrologic cycle and acts as the most important link between meteorological and agricultural droughts huang et al 2016 therefore it is of great importance to scientifically investigate the hydrological drought evolution and explore its influencing factors such as climate and lulc changes which can help water resources managers to develop robust preparation plans to reduce the adverse impacts of droughts drought indices are essential tools of an efficient drought assessment monitoring and forecasting aimed at providing a concise overall picture of drought conditions for the research fields of hydrological droughts many indices have been developed over the years shiau et al 2007a b borgomeo et al 2015 wu et al 2018 such as the palmer hydrological drought severity index phdi palmer 1965 standardized runoff index sri wang et al 2011a b standardized streamflow index ssfi maity et al 2016 surface water supply index swsi shafer and dezman 1982 hao and singh 2015 it is not difficult to find that these indices are characterized by surface runoff or streamflow but neglect the changes in groundwater mishra and singh 2010 groundwater recharge and discharge plays an important role in the hydrological process groundwater amount level is a significant hydrological variable to characterize hydrological drought shahid et al 2010 li and rodell 2015 ottosen et al 2018 hence in recent years some hydrological drought indices based on groundwater resource status such as groundwater recharge and discharge groundwater water level or groundwater statistics have been proposed to characterize hydrological droughts for example mendicino et al 2008 presented a novel groundwater resource index gri to monitor and forecast hydrological drought conditions in a mediterranean region bloomfield and marchant 2013 constructed a new index of standardized groundwater level index sgi to characterize groundwater droughts li and rodell 2015 used the groundwater drought index gwi to assess groundwater drought in the central and northeastern of united states based on observations from nasa s gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission thomas et al 2017 constructed a new index of grace groundwater drought index ggdi to evaluate groundwater drought occurrence and quantify groundwater storage deficits in the central valley of california generally each index has its own strength and weakness as summarized in table 1 but from table 1 we can observed that current hydrological droughts only considers one variable of surface water or groundwater which could not be insufficient to characterize hydrological drought due to its multivariate phenomenon in other word hydrological drought is essentially a water imbalance in a hydrological system characterized by reductions in not only surface flow but also groundwater level and thus leads to abnormally low streamflow and low water storages in a lake or river nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 hao and aghakouchak 2013 zhai et al 2015 in natural conditions surface water is closely linked to groundwater with nearly linear relationship i e the increase or decrease of surface water is usually accompanied with the increase or decrease of groundwater hence hydrological droughts can be characterized by surface runoff or streamflow however in some cases the underlying land surface of a river basin may have been largely altered due to the human activities which directly affects the natural hydrologic cycle and may alter the linear relationship between surface water and groundwater for example han 2003 found that the large extent of overexploitation of groundwater in hai river huai river and yellow river basins of china has caused deeper unsaturated zones that seriously hindered the groundwater recharge from surface water manoj et al 2019 pointed out that the heavy overexploitation of groundwater would cut off the linkage between surface water and groundwater these phenomena are easy to cause groundwater recharge is independent of surface water so the interaction between surface water and groundwater becomes more complex and is often characterized by non linear relationship lischeid and bittersohl 2008 taie and koch 2019 manoj et al 2019 that is to say surface water is in a normal or even abundant status with groundwater in dry status or groundwater is abundant with the deficit in surface water therefore only using the surface flow or groundwater to construct a hydrological drought index obviously can t reflect the true hydrological drought conditions objectively and accurately therefore it is urgent and necessary to establish a composite index to reflect the complicated nonlinear hydrological drought phenomena currently numerous studies on constructing multivariate standardized drought index based on different methods have been published for example linear combination is a common method to combine different drought indices svoboda et al 2002 applied a linear weighted method to construct an objective blend of drought indicators obdi hao et al 2016 proposed a linearly combined drought index ldi to predict the drought in new york and california in the united states in addition some researchers also use the principal component analysis pca to construct the multivariate drought index keyantash and dracup 2004 applied the pca method to develop an aggregate drought index adi integrating the meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts entropy theory is also a way to construct the multivariate drought index rajsekhar et al 2015 constructed a multivariate drought index mdi based on entropy method waseem et al 2015 and chang et al 2016 also developed multivariate standardized drought indices using this method however multivariate standardized drought index constructed by the linear combination principal component analysis and entropy weight method all assume a linear relationship between different hydrological or drought indices which is obviously inconsistent with the reality mo and lettenmaier 2014 yang et al 2018 to solve this problem a copula function has been gaining popularity in recent years and is considered as an effective way to reflect the complicated and nonlinear relationship between multiple hydrologic variables hao and aghakouchak 2013 van de vyver and van den bergh 2018 wang et al 2019 fang et al 2019 therefore to better understand and characterize the variability and changes in hydrological droughts we construct a nonlinear joint hydrological drought index njhdi using copulas that takes into account both surface water and groundwater conditions as well as their nonlinear interaction in this study which is the main scientific innovation of this study accurate estimation of hydrological process such as surface water and groundwater is a challenging task given the spatial heterogeneity in terrain soil composition and changes in underlying surface due to the human activities huang et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 for example land surface characteristics usually represented by land use and land cover lulc can have significant influences on hydrological process by affecting rainfall infiltration overland and channel flows groundwater recharge and discharge and so on changing the underlying surface is thus one of the ways that human activities have altered the regional hydrological cycle in many places hence accurately reflecting the underlying surface characteristics is crucial for hydrological process simulation in recent year physically based distributed hydrological models such as soil and water assessment tool swat and variable infiltration capacity vic have been gaining popularity and are considered as effective ways to simulate complex hydrological process by calibrating model parameters which can reflect all the independent characteristics of underlying land surface for a watershed in an aggregated way zhang et al 2015 eum et al 2016 to properly reflect the changes in land surface characteristics and to ensure the accuracy of hydrological process simulation we use the approach of time varying model parameters for periods with different lulc conditions proposed by li et al 2019 to estimate the surface water and groundwater more accurately using swat model generally time varying parameters is that allows for different sets of model parameter values during different periods when the change significantly between periods when one lulc pattern can represent the overall characteristics of underlying land surface variation within a period we use a portion of that period for model calibration and the other portion for validation the detailed procedures in applying the time varying parameters in swat model can be referred to li et al 2019 this paper aims to develop a new hydrological index named nonlinear joint hydrological drought index njhdi to investigate the spatiotemporal variations in hydrological droughts scientifically and reasonably the njhdi contains three contributions addressing combining the surface water and the groundwater considering the nonlinear interaction between surface water and groundwater and reflecting changes in underlying land surface the rest of the paper is organized as follows the case study area is introduced in section 2 the methodology and data sources are presented in section 3 and then followed by results and analysis in section 4 section 5 draws the conclusions and discusses the limitation of our study 2 case study and datasets 2 1 a case study of the yellow river basin this study focuses on the yellow river basin yrb which is the second largest river in china and the sixth largest river in the world with a length of 5464 km fig 1 it is located in the central and north china with a drainage area of 795 000 km2 and it meanders through nine provinces from upstream to downstream addressing qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia neimeng shanxi shaanxi henan and shandong provinces and across the tibet plateau the loess plateau and the north china plain before entering into the eastern china sea the yellow river flows north turns south and then bends east before debouching into the ocean the climatic and topographic characteristics varies widely between different parts of the yrb the mean annual precipitation ranges from 123 to 1021 mm increasing from the northwest towards the southeast the mean annual temperature is approximately 4 to 14 c varying with both latitude and elevation zhang et al 2015 guo et al 2019 to analyze the spatial hydrological drought characteristics the study area is divided into six zones which are mainly based on the different climatic and topographic characteristics in the yrb fig 1 zone a is the source area of the yellow river and mainly locates in the qinghai tibet plateau which runs through the paleobasins and hills between bayan kara mountains and jishishan mountains and it is one of the most sensitive regions to climate change in the world hence zone a belongs to the plateau climate region and semi arid and semi humid region zone b is the region from tangnaihai to lanzhou section and two key reservoirs longyangxia and liujiaxia are located in this region the temperature in zone b is warmer than that in zone a so it belongs to the transition zone between plateau climate zone and mid temperate zone zone c ningxia inner mongolia reach is from lanzhou to toudaoguan section which is the main water consuming and disaster prone area of the yrb it is located in the loess plateau and flows through the valley basin and hetao plain the flow velocity is relatively slow and the precipitation is relatively low in this region it belongs to the arid and semi arid zone in the middle temperate zone zone d wei river basin also located in the loess plateau area is the largest tributary of the yrb it is one of the main sources of sediment in the lower reaches of the yellow river due to the serious soil erosion in this region and zone d belongs to the warm temperate semi arid zone zone e has good conditions of runoff yield and concentration with high stream gradient and many tributaries in this region two other key reservoirs sanmenxia and xiaolangdi are located in this area however this region is prone to occur rainstorms and torrential rains in summer in since it belongs to temperate continental climate and semi arid and semi humid zone zone f is the lower reach of yrb below the huayuankou section it is located in the north china plain where the precipitation is relatively sufficient but the runoff yield condition is relatively poor with serious sediment deposition and it belongs to temperate monsoon climate and humid zone the yrb has long been regarded as the mother river of china it provides domestic water supply for about 140 million people in more than 50 large and medium sized cities and it provides water supply for agricultural irrigation over approximately 1 6 105 km2 cropland that accounts for about 15 of the total irrigated land in china however the yrb has historically been experiencing frequently hydrological droughts which deeply influenced the chinese civilization from the ancient times to the present wu et al 2018 chang et al 2016 for example one of worst hydrological droughts that occurred in 1920s to early 1930s affected approximately 20 million people and over 3 million people died from starvation and related diseases huang et al 2015 in recent decades the yellow river has become a seasonal river and hydrological droughts have become more severe and frequent the most serious hydrological drought happened in 1997 when the downstream of yrb dried up for more than 226 days and more than 700 km of the river bed was exposed which had adverse impacts on ecological and agro socioeconomic systems cong et al 2009 currently there has been a number of studies on the hydrological drought in the yrb she and xia 2013 chang et al 2016 but none of them considered the nonlinear relationship between surface water and groundwater or the changes in underlying land surfaces therefore the yrb is selected as a case study to thoroughly investigate drought evolution characteristics using the nonlinear joint hydrological drought index njhdi and the results can help to prevent and mitigate the hydrological droughts in the yrb 2 2 datasets to support model calibration and simulations a number of datasets are used in this study the elevation data is extracted from nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem with a resolution ratio of 30 m the soil map 1 1 000 000 fig 2 and lulc data 1 100 000 for three periods 1980 2000 and 2010 fig 2 are obtained from data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn meteorological data including daily maximum and minimum temperature precipitation humidity solar radiation and wind speed from 1966 to 2010 at 121 weather stations claret colored dots in fig 1 are available from the national climate center of china in this study naturalized monthly streamflow from 1960 to 2010 at five hydrological stations green dots in fig 1 are obtained from the yellow river conservancy commission and they are used to calibrate and validate the swat model here the naturalized streamflow is the observed hydrological stream flow plus the water use quantity i e the naturalized streamflow has eliminated the influence of direct human activities on it such as reservoir storage irrigation industrial domestic and agricultural water consumption the average annual groundwater resources from 1980 to 2000 in eight subzones based on the secondary basin boundary http www geodata cn portal metadata viewmetadata jsp id 210008 10263 are obtained from the comprehensive planning of water resources cpwr in the yrb which is provided by the yellow river water conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources and the groundwater resources mainly refer to shallow groundwater which is a dynamic water quantity participating in water cycle and renewable year by year 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological modeling 3 1 1 the swat model many watershed scale distributed hydrological models have been developed in recent years jiao et al 2017 the soil and water assessment tool swat one of the most suitable models for simulating hydrological process such as surface and groundwater under the changing environment arnold et al 1998 woldesenbet et al 2017 li et al 2019 taie and koch 2019 was applied in the yrb to simulate the surface water and groundwater in this study based on the digital elevation model dem and the channel network the yrb was divided into 381 sub basins ranging from 6 to 12 176 km2 then they were further divided into smaller hydrologic response units hrus based on the dominant land use soil type and slope using lulc maps in 1980 2000 and 2010 the yrb was divided into 1749 1755 and 1753 hrus respectively 3 1 2 time varying model parameters for periods with different lulc conditions here we use the approach that allows for different sets of model parameters during different periods when the underlying land surface characteristics change li et al 2019 for a given period when there is no any significant change in lulc we use one part of this period for model calibration and the other part for model validation since there are three lulc maps we conducted calibration in all three periods represented by three lulc maps we conducted the change point analysis with mann kendell trend test on the naturalized streamflow time series from 1960 to 2010 at five hydrological stations the results showed that there was one change point in the naturalized streamflow time series that occurred in 1990 the change is likely associated with regional environment changes including climate and lulc hence the period before 1990 is referred to as the period when both climate and lulc changes were still minimal and the period after 1990 is referred to as the period when both climate and lulc changes were significant enough to have altered the hydrological cycle in the region therefore in this study we divided the entire study period 1966 2010 into baseline period 1966 1990 and impact period 1991 2010 the impact period is further divided into two decades 1991 2000 and 2001 2010 as the lulc changes are more pronounced in the second decade which will be facilitated and supported by the lulc change characteristics discussed later in section 4 1 the performance of swat can be evaluated by three criteria the nashsutcliffe coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 and percentage of bias pbias gupta et al 1999 the ns is widely used in hydrology assessment to measure the goodness of fit between the observations and simulations the performances of swat model are considered satisfied adequate and very good when ns ranges from 0 5 to 0 54 from 0 55 to 0 65 and are larger than 0 65 respectively moriasi et al 2007 the r2 indicates the correlation between two series and ranges from 0 to 1 ideal moriasi et al 2007 the pbias represents the average deviation of the simulations from the observations a negative positive pbias value suggests that the simulations underestimate overestimate the observations the swat model performance is satisfactory when the absolute value of pbias ranges from 15 to 25 good when the absolute value of pbias ranges from 10 to 15 and very good when the absolute value of pbias is smaller than 10 and 0 is the ideal one moriasi et al 2007 overall according to moriasi et al 2007 the performance of the swat model at the monthly scale can be considered satisfactory if ns 0 5 r2 0 6 and pbias 25 when the swat model parameters are calibrated well the hydrological process including rainfall infiltration runoff generation overland and channel flows can be well simulated hence the hydrological components in 381 sub basins can be obtained from the swat simulation results and the surface water and groundwater components in each zones are calculated by the weighted average method of surface water and groundwater in all sub basins accordingly since the areas of sub basins are different 3 2 copula based joint hydrological drought deficit index to consider the changes in both surface water and groundwater as well as their nonlinear interaction during a hydrological drought a copula function was applied in this study to construct a new hydrological drought index named nonlinear joint hydrological drought index njhdi copula functions not only has the advantages of offering the flexibility to construct the joint distribution of random variables regardless of their marginal distributions but also has the abilities to accurately describe the nonlinear and asymmetric relationships between variables moriasi et al 2007 guo et al 2020 the framework of the njhdi was motivated by the commonly used standardized precipitation index spi through the joint distribution of surface water and groundwater to characterize the overall hydrological drought condition the procedure basically included 1 identifying marginal distributions of surface water and groundwater 2 selecting suitable copulas to obtain the cumulative joint probability of surface water and groundwater and 3 transforming the cumulative joint probability to the njhdi we describe the procedure in detail below 3 2 1 marginal distribution in this study three distributions i e the exponential distribution lognormal distribution and gamma distribution were applied to fit the marginal distributions of surface water and groundwater the specific procedures of these three distribution functions were described by kayid and izadkhah 2015 li et al 2015 and rohan et al 2015 respectively the akaike information criteria aic developed by akaike 1974 was applied to select the appropriate marginal distribution the formula of aic is as follows 1 aic 2 k n log 1 n i 1 n p e p t 2 where n is the sample size p e is the empirical frequency p t is the theoretical frequency k is the number of fitted parameters 3 2 2 joint probability distribution assuming surface water and groundwater as two random variables x and y the joint distribution with the cumulative joint probability p can be calculated with a copula function c as chang et al 2016 2 p x x y y c f x g x p where f x and g y are the marginal cumulative distributions of random variables x and y respectively a wide variety of copula families have been used to model different dependence structures of random variables among them the archimedean copulas are popular because the explicit functional forms are flexible and allow for differences in tail behavior for example the frank copula offers a symmetric dependence structure while gumbel and clayton copulas exhibit asymmetric dependence structures salvadori et al 2007 hence the archimedean copulas including frank clayton and gumbel hougaard copulas were selected to model the joint distribution between surface water and groundwater variables the frank copula for example can be expressed as chang et al 2016 3 c f x g x 1 θ ln 1 e θ f x 1 e θ g x 1 e θ 1 where θ is the parameter and f x and g y are the marginal cumulative probabilities of surface water and groundwater respectively in this study the nonparametric estimation method that was put forward by genest and rivest 1993 was used to estimate copula parameters the parametric estimation by this method is mainly based on the relationships between the kendall rank correlation coefficient τ and corresponding copula parameter θ and the function is shown as follows 4 τ 1 4 θ 1 θ 0 t e t 1 d t 1 where t is the integration variable the selection of copula is also based on the minimum value of aic which was presented in section 3 2 1 for detailed descriptions of clayton and gumbel hougaard copula functions the interested reader can refer to chang et al 2016 3 2 3 the nonlinear joint hydrological drought deficit index based on the cumulative joint probability p expressed in eq 2 the nonlinear joint hydrological drought deficit index njhdi is defined as 5 njhdi f 1 p where f p is the standard normal distribution function eq 5 transforms the joint probability p to the njhdi that is in the same space as the spi hence the classification of drought severity with the njhdi can simply refer to the spi the thresholds corresponding to no drought abnormally dry moderate drought severe drought and extreme drought are shown in table 2 3 3 quantifying the spatiotemporal impacts on hydrological droughts to quantify the spatiotemporal impacts of climate and lulc changes on hydrological droughts in the yrb we conduct the following modelling experiments using swat model with different configurations described below other inputs such as dem and soil data are all kept fixed bl baseline simulation over the baseline period with 1980 lulc and baseline parameters cl climate change simulations over the impact period with 1980 lulc and baseline parameters lc lulc change two simulations over the baseline period with 2000 and 2010 lulc and corresponding time varying parameters ip impact period two simulations over the impact period with 2000 and 2010 lulc respectively and corresponding time varying parameters for each simulation we calculate the hydrological drought frequency using njhdi the impacts of climate and lulc changes on the hydrological droughts were defined as 6 p climate f cl f bl f ip f bl 100 7 p lulc f lc f bl f ip f bl 100 where f bl f cl f lc and f ip are the frequency of hydrological droughts in the experiments of bl lc cl ip respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 lulc change characteristics in the yrb the land use cover patterns in 1980 2000 and 2010 in the yrb are shown in fig 2 and the quantification of the area and associated changes of various lulc types between 1980 and 2010 is given in table 3 from table 3 it can be found that grassland and cropland were the two largest lulc types during the last three decades and they accounted for approximately 50 and 30 of the total area of the yrb but areas of these two major types reduced from 1980 to 2010 declining by 3465 km2 8 96 and 1901 km2 8 50 respectively build up area was from 18 105 km2 in 1980 to 21 952 km2 in 2010 which increased by 21 25 the increase in build up area mostly happened during 2000 2010 from 19 053 to 21 952 km2 with increasing by 15 22 due to the rapid urban development and expansion woodland increased from 106 426 to 109 011 km2 2 43 over the past three decades because of the government policy on forest protection the increase of water body in the last 10 years was largely due to the implementation of the grain for green project ggp by the government started in 1999 wang et al 2010 we use the lulc transition matrix to quantify the spatial transformations that took place among different lulc types in the yrb during the past few decades the lulc transition matrix has been widely applied to analyze and quantify lulc changes between different land use types wang et al 2010 ning et al 2018 the matrix not only contains the static lulc information but also includes abundant dynamic change information in a certain period the lulc transition matrix is usually presented as the following form a 1 1 a 1 2 a 1 n a 2 1 a 2 2 a 2 n a m 1 a m 2 a m n where a m n is the area of land cover type m that has been converted to land cover type n during the period of consideration and the detailed computational procedure can be found in wang et al 2010 based on lulc maps of 1980 2000 and 2010 the transition matrices are established between 1980 and 2000 and between 2000 and 2010 as shown in table 4 each value in the table is the area of the land cover type labeled with the row being converted to the land cover type labeled with the column it can be found that the spatiotemporal conversions of lulc types was bidirectional i e the conversion of one lulc type out to another was usually accompanied by other lulc types converting back into this type for example during the period of 1980 2000 high frequency transfer occurred among cropland and grassland cropland was mainly transformed into grassland while grassland was mainly converted to cropland with transfer areas of 4689 km2 and 1991 km2 respectively during the period of 2000 2010 high rate conversion occurred among cropland woodland and grassland cropland was mainly transformed into grassland woodland was mainly changed into cropland and grassland while grassland was mainly converted to cropland their transfer areas were 2334 km2 1576 km2 1581 km2 and 3810 km2 accordingly all of these data indicate that the underlying land surface characteristics of the yrb have changed significantly due to the human activities 4 2 model calibration and validation by time varying parameters the swat model was calibrated and validated for each of the periods separately for the baseline period the lulc map for 1980 was used to represent the land use pattern the years of 1966 and 1967 were used to spin up the model and the periods of 1968 1980 and 1981 1990 were used for model calibration and validation respectively for the impact periods the lulc maps for 2000 and 2010 were used to represent these two decades within each impact period the first six years of the record were used for model calibration and the last four years were used for model validation calibration and validation measured by the three metrics i e ns r2 and pbias were summarized in table 5 and it shows that the swat model is able to simulate the naturalized streamflow at all five hydrological stations reasonably well and the model performance is considered satisfactory to demonstrate and quantify the usefulness of time varying parameters in the swat model performance two sets of model simulations were conducted for the validation of two impact periods the simulations setups were identical except that in one used the model parameters obtained from the baseline period calibration while the other used parameters obtained from the calibration for the same period i e one was using the method of time varying parameters and the other one was using traditional method that the parameters were calibrated in the baseline period then the calibrated parameters were kept invariant remained the same as baseline parameters when simulating the hydrological process in the validation of two impact periods table 6 summarizes the comparison with the three metrics ns r2 and pbias it is clear that using the parameters obtained from baseline calibration the model performance was significantly degraded especially for the middle and downstream stations the numbers in bold indicate that the metrics fail to reach the minimum benchmark suggesting that the swat model running with the baseline parameters had unsatisfactory performance to model the streamflow during the impact period this is mainly due to the yrb especially in the middle and lower reaches has been significantly highly modified by human activities resulting in significant changes in underlying surface characteristics as shown in section 4 1 as we know the calibrated model parameters to a large extent compensate the model deficiencies and errors to best fit the observations during the calibration period thus their values are often dependent upon lulc patterns and underlying surface characteristics so it is implausible to assume the baseline parameters were still suitable under the new lulc conditions in the 1990s and 2000s while using the time varying parameters the model performance was considerably better with most of ns and r2 as high as 0 7 to 0 8 in addition the values of ns of both decades with time varying parameters were larger than those with baseline parameters which further verifies the time varying parameters can better characterize the underlying land surfaces more accurately furthermore to suggest the reliability of simulated groundwater in swat model with time varying parameters the average annual groundwater resources from 1980 to 2000 in eight subzones based on the secondary basin boundary fig 3 a were used to compare with the simulated groundwater in corresponding subzones and the results are shown in fig 3 b from fig 3 we can that the groundwater from swat model in these subzones show slightly larger than that of from cpwr with relative errors of lower than 10 which are primary caused by the inevitable model structure and input data accuracy therefore groundwater based on simulations from swat model with time varying parameters provides an alternative method to take forward the study of groundwater drought that is hindered by the lack of direct observations of groundwater over time and space 4 3 the constructed nonlinear joint hydrological drought index njhdi based on the procedures for deriving njhdi discussed in detail in section 3 3 the annual and seasonal njhdi in six zones are obtained since njhdi combines the joint deficit characteristics of surface water and groundwater as well as their connections it should show better properties to demonstrate the reliability of the constructed njhdi the standardized naturalized streamflow index ssfi and standardized groundwater index sgi are computed in six zones to compare with the constructed njhdi in yrb since zone d often suffered historical droughts since the 1990s huang et al 2014 chang et al 2016 the annual ssfi and njhdi covering 1990 2010 are plotted and shown in fig 4 it can be clearly observed from fig 4 that the njhdi time series has a high consistence with ssfi and sgi time series and their correlation coefficients are 0 69 and 0 68 respectively table 7 additionally their correlation coefficients in other five zones are also shown in table 6 and from table 7 we can also observe that njhdi has high correlation coefficients with ssfi and sgi within each zone which verifies the reliability of the constructed njhdi in addition the correlation coefficients in the upstream are larger than those in the middle and downstream the primary reason is that the linkage between the surface water and groundwater would be cut off since the underlying surface characteristics lulc characteristics of the middle and downstream of the yrb have been largely altered due to the intensive human activities to further demonstrate the value of the constructed njhdi the years when historical droughts occurred during 1990 2010 in the yrb are collected from earlier studies yrcc 2008 2010 these researches indicated that the yrb experienced extremedroughts in 1995 1997 2000 2007 and 2009 which almost mainly occurred in the shaanxi provinces hence we took zone d as an example to show the performance of the constructed njhdi on capturing droughts and from fig 4 we can clearly see that these five droughts in zone d were all captured by njhdi while only three droughts were captured by ssfi and sgi taking the extreme drought year of 1997 as an example the yearly surface water in zone d was 179 mm while the groundwater was in a serious deficit status with only 29 mm so only considering the surface water or groundwater to characterize hydrological drought could not accurately reflect the hydrological drought condition and it is why jhdi is more sensitive and effective to capture historically droughts owing to taking into account changes in both surface water and groundwater similarly the comparative results in other five zones are the same as zone d and their relevant figures are not shown here due to the page limit in sum the constructed njhdi is a reliable index for hydrological drought assessment which can be adopted to scientifically investigate the hydrological drought evolution in the yrb 4 4 spatial temporal variability of hydrological droughts in the yrb 4 4 1 spatial variability of hydrological droughts in the yrb to investigate the most common drought category within each zone we examined the spatial variability of hydrological drought in the yrb with a focus on the frequency of hydrological droughts at different severity categories throughout the whole study period of 1968 2010 based on the annual njhdi the spatial distribution of drought frequency at different categories was exhibited in fig 5 it can be observed that the annual hydrological drought frequencies for different categories have a noticeable spatial differences and for the same drought severity category the frequencies are also quite different for different zones within the yrb in general the middle and downstream of the yrb had more severity categories with higher frequencies than the upstream mainly zone a and zone b indicating that the annual hydrological drought risk in the middle and downstream was higher than the upstream of the yrb for example zone a experienced abnormally dry and moderate drought conditions more often than other zones and zones b more often experienced moderate drought than others but zone c and zone e were more likely to occur severe droughts and zone f was more prone to occur severe and extreme droughts in particular zone d was most likely to experienced extreme drought with the highestfrequency of 41 50 in the past 43 years which indicated that when hydrological droughts occurred in zone d their severities were easily escalated to the extreme drought category to explain the spatial differences of hydrological droughts at the year timescale the annual average surface water and groundwater are summarized in zone a least often extreme droughts and zone d most often extreme droughts the results show that the annual average surface water in zone a and zone d had little differences with 219 mm and 207 mm respectively while the groundwater showed noticeable differences with 151 mm in zone a but 60 mm in zone d from fig 5 we know that zone a had the lowest frequency to occur extreme drought while zone d had the highest frequency to occur extreme drought in the last 43 years and as emphasized in this article hydrological drought is essentially a water imbalance in a hydrological system characterized by reductions in not only surface water but groundwater so when little difference of surface water 12 mm was observed in zone a and zone d the great difference of occurring extreme droughts between zone a and zone d was mainly ascribed to the noticeable difference of groundwater with 91 mm hence the deficit in groundwater in zone d was the main reason that resulted in the high frequency of extreme droughts occurred in this region which also in turn verifies that the significant role of groundwater variable on characterizing watershed hydrological drought in addition to examine the spatial distribution features of the hydrological drought in the yrb at the year timescale we also analyzed its spatial distribution characteristics at the season timescale using the average seasonal njhdi for the period of 1968 2010 the spatial distributions of hydrological drought frequency in different seasons are shown in fig 6 we can see that the hydrological drought was the least severe with the lowest risk in summer compared to the summer the hydrological drought was more severe in spring with higher risk and that in winter was the most severe especially in the middle and down streams of the yrb the results are similar to the of finding of huang 2015 which further proves that the hydrological drought assessment based on the constructed njhdi in present study is reasonable and reliable in the yrb to further investigate what kind of drought category is most likely to occur during the winter in each zone the spatial distribution of hydrological drought frequency at different categories is exhibited in fig 7 and from fig 7 we can clearly observe that zone a and zone b experienced moderate drought conditions more often than other zones and zone c and zone f were more likely to occur severe droughts than others while zone d and zone e were more prone to occur extreme droughts similar to the annual hydrological drought characteristics zone d was most likely to experience extreme drought in winter with the highestfrequency of 51 60 also the average winter surface water and groundwater in zone a least often extreme droughts and zone d most often extreme droughts are also take as the examples to explain this phenomenon and the results show that little difference exists in winter surface water between zone a 54 mm and zone d 51 mm while the winter groundwater in zone d 15 mm is much smaller than that in zone a 37 mm so it can be concluded that when hydrological droughts occurred in zone d whether within the year or winter their severities are easily escalated to the extreme drought category mainly due to the deficit in groundwater which in turn confirms the significant importance of the groundwater variation when characterizing hydrological droughts 4 4 2 temporal variability of hydrological droughts in the yrb fig 8 reveals the changes in annual hydrological drought frequency over time above the severe drought category i e including severe drought and extreme drought these are the categories that can have the most serious impact on agriculture ecosystems and environment generally these types of droughts became more frequent in recent decades during the baseline period the whole basin experienced severe or extreme droughts with a low frequency within 15 the likelihood for having a severe drought or extreme hydrological drought is small for the entire basin at that time in the 1990s the frequency for having a severe drought or extreme drought year increased for zones b d e and f especially for zone d with the highest hydrological drought frequency of 86 100 indicating that zone d is the most frail place to experience these two types of droughts in the 1990s then in the 2000s the frequency decreased in zones d and f implying that zones d and f had a certain tendency toward wet and the drought risks for these two categories tended to reduce while the frequency increased significantly over zones c and e suggesting a much elevated drought risk in these regions fig 9 shows the changes of the annual average surface water and groundwater in each zone in 1990s and 2000s compared to the baseline period and from it we can see that the surface water kept decreasing but the groundwater kept increasing throughout the 1990s and 2000s which may explain why the hydrological drought frequency in zone a has no obvious change over time the surface water and groundwater in the b d e and f all show decreasing trends in the 1990s such as the dramatic declining in groundwater with 65 mm in the zone d which directly causes the high frequency of hydrological droughts in 1990s compared with the 1990s the groundwater in zone d and the surface water in zone f both has a certain recovery in the 2000s and this is the main reason that the drought risks for having severe drought or extreme droughts tended to reduce during the 2000s overall the risk for having a severe or extreme hydrological drought within the year in zones c and e increased over time due to the continuous decline of both surface water and groundwater the hydrological drought frequency in zones d increased in the 1990s mainly ascribing to the dramatic decrease of groundwater but that had a certain mitigation in the 2000s primarily owing to the recovery of the groundwater in some extent the recovery of the groundwater in zone d is mainly related to the implementation of soil and water conservation policy in the wei river basin with ecological and engineering measures in the late 1990s which has increased the areas of woodland and grassland and thus increasing the groundwater recharge from soil water since hydrological droughts were more frequent in winter in the past 40 years we also analyzed the temporal changes in hydrological drought frequency in this season above the severe drought category fig 10 similar to the annual drought change trend these two types of droughts became more frequent in winter in recent decades especially in zones c d and e where the frequency increased significantly in the 2000s during the baseline period zones a and f suffered a higher frequency of severe or extreme hydrological drought than other zones while the opportunity for having these two types of drought is slim in zones b and c at that time in the 1990s the frequency of a severe or extreme drought increased in zones c d and e but decreased in zones a and f implying that these two categories of hydrological drought in zones a and f had a certain mitigation then in the 2000s the frequency continued to increasing over zones c d and e suggesting a much elevated drought risk in these regions fig 11 shows the changes of the average surface water and groundwater in winter for each zone in 1990s and 2000s compared to the baseline period and from it we can see that the surface water and groundwater in zones a b and f compared to the baseline period have no significant changes while those in zones c d and e show significant decrease especially for the surface water that declined drastically which may be caused by the icing phenomenon due to the low temperature thus higher drought frequencies were observed in zones c d and e in winter in general the risk for having a severe or extreme hydrological droughts during the winter in zones a b and f maintained low frequency within 40 while that increased significantly over time in zones c d and e largely ascribing to the significant decline in surface water it is worth to mention that zones c d and e are primarily in the loess plateau where the ecosystem is extremely fragile extreme droughts can cause environmental degradation that is hard to recover posing serious challenges for natural resource management additionally many previous drought related studies in the yrb xie and fu 2004 shiau et al 2007a b she and xia 2013 xu et al 2014 also pointed out that the high drought risk in the loess plateau which is consistent with our findings in this study and thus once more confirms that the hydrological drought analysis with the constructed njhdi is reasonable and reliable in the yrb 4 5 impacts of climate and lulc changes on hydrological drought based on the procedures described in section 3 3 impacts of climate and lulc changes on hydrological drought frequency of most often drought category in each zone were quantified the changes in drought frequency between the baseline period and the impact period were calculated then attributed to either of the factors positive contribution shows that the factor either climate or lulc change helps to increase the drought frequency while negative contribution means it adversely reduce the drought risk the results of impacts of climate and lulc changes on annual and winter hydrological droughts are shown in tables 8 and 9 respectively from them we can see that the impacts of climate and lulc changes on hydrological drought were nonlinear and varied remarkably in space and time for example the lulc change dominated to aggravate the annual drought risks in zones c e and f while the climate change was the primary factor that aggravates the main hydrological drought category occurred in winter in zones a b d and f compared to the 1990s the impacts of climate changes were greater in the 2000s over zones a and b but smaller in over zones d and f this pattern primarily related to the climate and lulc change degrees in these zones during different periods compared to the baseline period the change degrees of lulc and climate mainly the precipitation and temperature in winter in these zones in the 1990s and 2000 s were calculated and the results are shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively from fig 12 it can be inferred that the shrinkage of water body and the expansion of build up might be the major driving forces to the reduction of surface water and groundwater respectively thus causing high frequency of most often drought categories in zones c e and f from fig 13 we can see that the change degree of average winter precipitation in zone a and zone b showed little difference between the 1990s and 2000s while the change degree of the average winter temperature in the 2000s were much higher than that in the 1990s which indicates that the sharp increases of winter temperature in the 2000s with 1 5 c in zone a and 0 9 c in zone b were the main reason that led the impact of climate change on hydrological droughts to be greater than that in the 1990s in zones a and b for zone d and f the average winter temperature in the 1990s and 2000s both increased by 1 2 c 1 5 c but the precipitation decreased in the 1990s while increased in the 2000s subsequently inferring that the average decrease of winter precipitation in the 1990s was the dominant factor that causes the impact of climate change on hydrological drought being greater than that in the 2000s 5 summaries and conclusion hydrological drought is essentially a water imbalance in a hydrological system characterized by reductions in surface water and groundwater hence using only surface water or groundwater to characterize hydrological drought may not accurately reflect the hydrological drought conditions especially in basins like the yellow river basin yrb where the subsurface hydrology is highly influenced by human activities therefore in this study we constructed a nonlinear joint hydrological drought index njhdi that takes into consideration of both surface water and groundwater conditions as well as their nonlinear interaction to better understand and characterize the variations and changes in hydrological droughts in the yrb furthermore to reflect the changes in underlying land surface on hydrological process we applied an alternative approach of time varying parameters by calibrating swat model for periods with different lulc conditions then based on these time varying parameters the surface and underground water at the year and season timescales in six zones of the yrb were accurately estimated and the corresponding njhdi for each zone was calculated by extending the spi through the joint distribution of surface and underground water using copula function based on the constructed njhdi the spatiotemporal variability of hydrological droughts were examined with a focus on the frequency of hydrological droughts at different severity categories then compared with the baseline period of 1968 1990 the impacts of climate and lulc changes on the most often drought category in each zone of the yrb were quantified the results show that njhdi is more sensitive and effective to capture historically droughts than ssfi and sgi owing to taking into account changes in changes in surface water groundwater interactions and changes in underlying land surface generally on the year timescale the middle and downstream of the yrb have more severe hydrological droughts with higher frequencies than the upstream seasonally the hydrological drought in winter is the most severe especially in the middle and downstream of the yrb exploring reasons climate change is the primary factor that aggravate the annual hydrological droughts for the upstream while lulc change is the main driving force in the middle and downstream mainly caused by the shrinkage of water body and the expansion of build up conversely the hydrological drought occurred in winter in the loess plateau zones c and e is primarily due to the lulc change while that occurred in other parts of the yrb is primarily ascribed to the climate change largely due to the decrease of precipitation in the 1990s and the increase of temperature in the 2000s during the winter period particularly when hydrological droughts occurred in zone d whether within the year or in winter their severities were easily escalated to the extreme drought category during the past four decades and the increased frequency for severe and extreme hydrological droughts over zone c in winter approximately as high as 80 100 in the last 10 years is alarming zones c and d are primarily in the loess plateau where the ecosystems are extremely fragile thus the environmental degradation caused by the extreme droughts in these two zones was hard to recover which posed serious challenges for natural resource management great efforts have been made to scientifically investigate the hydrological drought evolution based on the constructed nonlinear joint hydrological drought index njhdi in this study while it still has limitation the present study mainly focuses on the impacts of climate and lulc changes on hydrological droughts but neglects the influence of artificial water consumption e g reservoir storage irrigation industrial domestic and agricultural water consumption on hydrological droughts which will be pursued in our future study
