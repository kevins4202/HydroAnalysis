14700,photogranules composed of algae nitrifiers and anammox bacteria are promising for nitrogen removal from wastewater with reduced aeration and carbon emissions however it is difficult to be achieved as the potential inhibition of anammox bacteria by light in this study a syntrophic algal partial nitrification anammox granular sludge process was developed with a nitrogen removal rate of 294 5 mg n l d we found the symbiosis in the community promoted the adaptation of anammox bacteria under light and cross feeding played an important role microalgae in the outer layers of photogranules sheltered most of the light and supplied cofactors and amino acids to promote nitrogen removal in particular myxococcota myx1 degraded the extracellular proteins produced by microalgae providing amino acids to the entire bacterial community which helped anammox bacteria save metabolic energy and adapt to light notably the anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia exhibited unique light sensing potential and adaptations to light irradiation compared with candidatus jettenia including diverse dna repair scavenging of reactive oxygen species cell movement the phytochrome like proteins encoded by candidatus brocadia further facilitated their spatial positioning and niche partitioning in photogranules this study provides insights into the response of anammox bacteria in the algae bacteria symbiosis system and suggests its potential application for carbon negative nitrogen removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nutrient removal and recovery anammox partial

national center for biotechnology information ncbi web site under bioproject prjna904676 1 introduction photogranule based systems are promising technologies for sustainable and low carbon wastewater treatment ji 2022 li et al 2022 algae as photosynthetic organisms can mitigate co2 emissions provide oxygen for nitrification and achieve resource recovery through biomass harvesting li et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a studies have shown that light promotes effective partial nitrification wang et al 2021 yang et al 2022a suggesting the applicability of a phototroph anammox symbiotic system for nitrogen removal manser et al 2016 yang et al 2022b zhang et al 2022b an algal partial nitrification anammox a pna system has been previously designed where microalgae produce oxygen to achieve effective nitrogen removal without aeration through the partial nitrification anammox pna process manser et al 2016 the combined a pna process can significantly reduce the costs associated with external carbon sources and aeration achieving effective autotrophic nitrogen removal with reduced carbon emissions during wastewater treatment zhang et al 2022b light is a key factor that promotes the growth of microalgae in algae bacteria symbiosis abs systems low strength light irradiation can stimulate the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and some denitrifiers but inhibit the growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob chu et al 2023 wang et al 2021 recently it was reported that light irradiation could significantly inhibit the anammox process by inducing the accumulation of intercellular reactive oxygen species ros in anammox bacteria ren et al 2022 however how anammox bacteria adapt to long term light irradiation remains elusive granulation is an important strategy through which anammox bacteria resist unfavorable environmental conditions gao et al 2021 where extracellular polymeric substances eps play a crucial role in maintaining granule stability although not systematically studied yet existing evidence suggests that metabolic interactions among bacteria could influence the synthesis of eps hosokawa et al 2021 ya et al 2022 zhao et al 2018 for instance acidobacteria affiliated chloroflexi affiliated bacteria and patescibacteria affiliated bacteria can facilitate the biosynthesis of sticky polysaccharides ps with precursors produced by anammox bacteria hosokawa et al 2021 ya et al 2022 additionally anammox bacteria can synthesize most amino acids to support other heterotrophs and affect the extracellular protein pn concentration lawson et al 2017 these metabolic interactions could further contribute to increased eps and particle size kong et al 2022 as larger granules support more diverse ecological niches chen et al 2020 the metabolic interaction within the a pna systems may contribute to eps formation and granulation providing an ecological niche for anammox bacteria in response to long term light irradiation microorganisms inhibited in bio granules exhibit emergent properties such as decreased energy consumption and enhanced stress tolerance karygianni et al 2020 cross feeding is a ubiquitous metabolic interaction in which microbes exchange metabolites with each other amin et al 2015 because most microalgae are cobalamin vitamin b12 or thiamin vitamin b1 auxotrophic they have to acquire these growth factors from symbiotic bacteria croft et al 2005 wu et al 2022 in contrast algae can provide fixed carbon for bacterial growth eps are biodegradable substances that act as sources of energy and amino acids for neighboring microorganisms karygianni et al 2020 during the transformation from activated sludge as to photogranules under light irradiation algae derived eps become dominant and act as public goods whereas bacteria derived eps gradually decays kuo dahab et al 2018 accordingly algae may be considered to supply energy by contributing amino acids to anammox bacteria and the entire community in the a pna system high intensity light is a threat to non phototrophic bacteria owing to its deleterious effects and photooxidative damage to nucleic acids and proteins van der horst et al 2007 to avoid damage by solar radiation many chemotrophic bacteria have evolved photoreceptor proteins that enable them to sense light gomelsky and hoff 2011 for instance bacteriophytochromes are one of the most abundant light sensing receptors davis et al 1999 xanthomonas which contains phytochromes can transform from a sessile into a free swimming motile lifestyle to avoid ultraviolet radiation verma et al 2020 additionally some studies have reported that anammox bacteria can adapt to light the marine anammox bacteria candidatus scalindua was able to resist ultraviolet light of 12 000 mj cm2 gao et al 2021 based on the aforementioned studies anammox bacteria may contain light sensing proteins to adapt to light and interact with wastewater borne microalgae to achieve stable autotrophic nitrogen removal in a single photobioreactor it is of great significance to gain further insight into the responses of anammox bacteria in long term light irradiation as well as the synergetic interactions among microorganisms in the a pna system in this study self sustaining a pna photogranules were developed using anammox granules as inoculum microbial samples were collected during different operational phases for metagenomic sequencing the aims of this study were to i develop a carbon negative autotrophic nitrogen removal process ii reveal the mechanisms by which functional microorganisms interact to effectively remove nitrogen and iii explore the adaptation mechanisms of anammox bacteria to long term light irradiation in photogranules this study can contribute to

it was assumed that the carbon source in the influent was used for denitrification rather than microbial assimilation rittmann and mccarty 2003 the carbon emissions during the nitrogen removal process were estimated by stoichiometry in eqs 1 4 and the nitrogen removal contribution of each reaction eq 1 shows the n and co2 uptake by algal biomass rashid et al 2014 eq 2 estimates co2 uptake during

light irradiation from day 40 including increased chlorophyll a concentration increased granular size and decreased eps concentration fig 1 in phase i days 0 40 spherical pna granules were successfully developed with anammox granules as the inner core fig 1a during phase ii days 41 70 indigenous microalgae rapidly bloomed under a light intensity of 6000 lux fig 1a and the chlorophyll a concentration increased to a maximum of 14 3 mg l on day 68 microscopic observations revealed that some unicellular microalgae grew outside the pna granules fig 1a pn and ps rapidly increased to the maximum value on day 60 and subsequently decreased to 53 1 and 23 0 mg g vss on day 70 fig 1d during phases iii iv days 71 122 measures reduced light intensity and increased settling time were adopted to control algal growth table 1 the chlorophyll a concentration was successfully controlled in the range of 8 11 mg l in phase iv fig 1a similarly the pn and ps contents continuously decreased to minimum values of 29 4 mg g vss pn and 12 2 mg g vss ps respectively at the end of phase iv day 120 after increasing the nlr in phase v days 123 146 the chlorophyll a concentration slightly increased to 12 5 mg l and the mlss and average granular size reached 3 45 mg l and 410 µm respectively at the end of the experiment figs 1b and 1c elemental composition analysis revealed that a pna photogranules were composed of 42 21 carbon 5 91 hydrogen and 8 27 nitrogen by mass according to the empirical formula of microalgal biomass c5h8 9o1 8n0 6 for microalgae and c5h7o2n for mixed culture bacteria rittmann and mccarty 2003 the microalgal bacterial mass ratio in granules was determined to be approximately 3 5 3 2 nitrogen removal performance to explore the nitrogen removal performance of the a pna process the aeration rate variation in nitrogen species nitrogen loading rate nlr and nitrogen removal rate nrr are shown in fig 2 the removal performance steadily improved after inoculation achieving an nrr of 155 2 mg n l d at the end of phase i figs 2 b and 2c after light irradiation the nrr continuously increased to 183 0 mg n l d on day 55 fig 2c however the nrr substantially deteriorated from day 60 to a minimum of 69 1 mg n l d on day 69 the results indicated the instability of the a pna system after microalgal overgrowth to control algal growth the light intensity decreased to 3000 lux in phase iii and the nrr slowly recovered to 157 6 mg n l d on day 100 fig 2c at the end of the experiment the nrr of the reactor reached a maximum value of 294 5 mg n l d and the a pna granule based system could remove 94 6 nitrogen over a short hrt of 8 h under a c n ratio of 1 1 figs 2b and 2c additionally nitrate was nearly undetectable in the effluent throughout the experiment figs 2b and s1 3 3 population shift of anammox bacteria from ca jettenia to ca brocadia after light irradiation to explore the succession of the microbial community the short read based metagenomic classification was performed fig 3 at the phylum level proteobacteria bacteroidetes and planctomycetes were the dominant bacteria and chlorophyta was the most abundant algae in the reactor fig 3a at the end of the experiment the most dominant bacterial genera were thauera abundance of 46 3 nitrosomonas abundance of 10 4 and ca brocadia abundance of 1 2 figs 3b 3g notably the abundance of nitrospira exhibited a distinct downward trend across the entire experiment and decreased to 0 04 in s5 fig 3b wastewater borne chlorella was the most abundant algal genus accounting for 0 8 2 5 of the microbial community whereas other microalgae cyanobacteria were relatively rare 0 1 ca jettenia and ca brocadia were the dominant genera of anammox bacteria in phase i with relative abundances of 6 8 and 1 4 respectively in s1 figs 3g and 3f notably the dominant anammox bacteria shifted from ca jettania to ca brocadia after light irradiation the abundance of ca jettenia sharply decreased to 0 2 in s5 in contrast ca brocadia were almost unchanged 1 1 1 2 in s2 s5 figs 3g and 3f in a pna photogranules the niche breadth of ca brocadia was 4 6 whereas it was only 1 9 ca jettenia fig s2 suggesting a higher adaptability of ca brocadia to light in a photogranule based system 3 4 spatial association among microbes in the a pna photogranules to explore the spatial distribution of key n transforming microorganisms the microalgae aob anammox bacteria and thauera in a section of a pna photogranules were visualized using clsm fig 4 a all the microbes detected with dapi are shown in blue the specific anammox amx820 and aob populations nso190 are displayed in green fig 4b and orange fig 4c respectively moreover the microalgae were detected with red self fluorescence fig 4d most aob and algae were located in the surface layer of granules and formed a thick outer rim whereas most of the anammox bacteria agglomerated and were located in the kernel of the photogranules figs 4a 4d fig s3 shows the distribution of thauera in the granules where it spread across the entire section with a close spatial distance to the microalgae the normalized fluorescence intensity of microalgae and aob rapidly decreased from the granule surface to the kernel figs 4c and 4d whereas that of anammox bacteria increased fig 4b the prevalence of diverse n transforming microorganisms suggests that distinct ecological niches and close microbial interactions exist in the photogranules over 10 fish images were analyzed to determine the proportions of anammox bacteria aob microalgae and thauera in the total microbial community the results showed that anammox bacteria accounted for an average of 17 7 of the microbial community whereas aob microalgae and thauera accounted for 11 7 8 4 and 34 2 respectively the discrepancy in the metagenomic abundance of anammox bacteria might be caused by small flocs that were unaccounted for indicating that photogranules with layered structure could provide a sufficient niche for anammox bacteria additionally sem demonstrated that microalgae primarily aggregated in the outer layer of the granules figs 4e 4h enclosing the internal bacterial biomass fig 4g and algal cells were tightly wrapped by the abundant eps on the granule surface fig 4f 3 5 synergetic metabolic interaction within the microbial community the microsensor measurement demonstrated that oxygen concentration rapidly decreased from the surface to the kernel in the granules fig s4 the oxygen concentration was 95 2 µmol l at a distance of 160 µm away from the granular surface and o2 limitation happened in the 240 µm depth from the granular surface fig 5 a based on the microsensor measurement clsm and sem images a microstructure was proposed for the a pna photogranules fig 5a microalgae in the outer layer can provide oxygen for aob and shelter light for anammox bacteria a portion of the influent nh4 could be oxidized by mid layer aob to no2 which was then used by the anammox bacteria in the kernel of the granule to further investigate the potential metabolic interactions among microbes in a pna photogranules the partial metabolic pathways of the key mags with average abundances 1 were proposed figs 5b and 5c they included chlorella sp alg1 thauera sp tha1 nitrosomonas sp aob1 myxococcota bacterium sp myx1 and candidatus brocadia sp amx7 the details of their genomes and relative abundances are provided in table s1 and fig s5 notably significant discrepancies in metabolic potential were observed among the different species vitamin b12 vb12 is necessary for the growth of most microalgae including b12 auxotrophs and alg1 croft et al 2005 interestingly both amx7 and tha1 exhibited synthetic pathways for vb12 synthesis figs 5b and s3 the abundance of tha1 with a close spatial distance to alg also increased during the operation fig s5 as return alg1 provided thiamine vb1 folate and pyridoxal phosphate to amx7 and tha1 as inferred from their metabolic potentials fig 5c additionally tha1 had the potential to provide molybdopterin cofactor moco and folate to amx7 fig 5b these are essential co factors that promote the activity of anammox bacteria ya et al 2022 zhao et al 2018 therefore potential metabolic cross feeds are essential for their coexistence and nitrogen removal capability amino acids have been characterized as important metabolite intermediates that shape microbial community assembly mee et al 2014 the abundant microalga alg1 exhibited the complete pathway for the synthesis of most amino acids with high metabolic costs e g phenylalanine and tyrosine as these amino acids were absent in most of the bacterial mags including amx7 they might obtain these amino acids from alg1 fig 5c pn degradation is another source of amino acids in microbial communities lawson et al 2017 notably myx1 encoded the maximum peptides and transporters and might be the dominant extracellular protein degrader in the photogranules fig s5 thus myx1 hydrolyzed pn from microalgae in a pna photogranules to high cost amino acids to the entire bacterial community which facilitated anammox bacteria to reduce metabolic energy myx1 as a high abundance about 11 fig s5 bacteria can also participate in partial denitrification of the nitrite loop in a pna photogranules fig 5c indicating that the nitrate generated from anammox bacteria can be reduced to nitrite by myx1 and reused by anammox bacteria 3 6 comparative genomic analysis reveal unique light sensing protein existed in ca brocadia comparative genomic analysis of ca brocadia and ca jettenia was performed fig 6 for characterizing the unique function correlating with the light adaptation of ca brocadia although a large number 1259 of the same functional genes were shared by the two anammox bacterial genera ca brocadia had 168 unique genes compared to ca jettenia fig 6a examination of these genes based on their cog functional categories revealed that ca brocadia differed considerably in cell motility replication and repair amino acid transport and metabolism energy consumption and conversion fig 6a indicating that these functions may play an essential role in the light adaptation of ca brocadia in particular ca brocadia has key genes in the repair of dna damage caused by light irradiation or ros truglio et al 2006 including dna mismatch repair muts and mutl and the uvrabc repair system fig 6b cristóvão et al 2012 truglio et al 2006 additionally the key ros defense genes kat sod2 and sora were detected in the six genomes of ca brocadia but were incomplete in some ca jettenia moreover genes related to chemotaxis che and flagellar assembly flg flh and fli were absent in all ca jettenia but were present in ca brocadia fig 6b thus ca brocadia exhibited more flexible cell mobility than ca jettenia facilitating its movement towards favorable environments and may affect niche differentiation fig s2 notably all genomes of ca brocadia encoded a phytochrome like protein bph which is a light sensing receptor involved in regulating diverse cellular processes fig 6b bhoo et al 2001 whereas this protein was absent in ca jettenia strong sequence homology was identified between previously reported bph sequences from different bacteria fig 6c davis et al 1999 the phytochrome like proteins in ca brocadia and the reference sequences contained an amino terminal chromophore binding domain followed by a histidine kinase module bhoo et al 2001 figs 6c and s6 suggesting that these proteins function as light activated kinases similar to other two component sensing systems west and stock 2001 4 discussion 4 1 niche differentiation in a pna photogranules favoring nitrogen removal the abs system is a promising low carbon and sustainable approach for wastewater treatment which has been extensively studied ji 2022 li et al 2022 a major limitation of this approach is the inhibition of functional bacteria particularly anammox bacteria by external light ren et al 2022 in this study a self sustaining a pna photogranule sludge process was developed using anammox granules and short cut as as inoculum the reactor was operated for 40 d before light irradiation was applied to prevent direct light exposure in anammox bacteria using this inoculation and start up strategy a pna photogranules with unique microstructures were successfully developed clsm and sem revealed distinct layers and ecological niches in the photogranules and the niche differentiation were attributed to their distinct sensitivities and responses to light microalgae require light for photosynthesis therefore they are located in the outermost layer fig 4d aob are primarily located in the mid outer layer because they require oxygen and favor low intensity light fig 4c wang et al 2021 yang et al 2022a the close spatial distance 10 µm between microalgae and aob could also achieve effective oxygen transfer promoting aob activity fig 4a do production at the surface and depletion of the kernel might be key factors in the formation of this unique structure additionally the dominant anammox bacteria amx7 exhibited light sensing ability and cell mobility facilitating their movement towards the kernel thus anammox bacteria were at a relatively long distance 50 µm from the granule surface fig 4b and the surface coverage of microalgae prevented the inhibition of anammox bacteria by light owing to this structure only a small fraction of the light can pass through the eps and gas channels to the kernel therefore layered a pna photogranules with sufficient anoxic aerobic areas could provide adequate niches for anammox bacteria in the granules fig s2 furthermore the specific structure of developed photogranules and the niche separation between aob and nob also contributed to stable partial nitrification the aob activity improved by 35 in phase v compared to phase i fig s1 whereas nob was nearly undetectable in phase v fig 3b this is consistent with the findings of a previous study showing that low intensity light stimulated aob activity while inhibiting nob growth wang et al 2021 as aerobic bacteria nob tend to grow in the outer layer of a pna granules similar to aob nevertheless external light is a threat to the surface nob thus no proper ecological niches were available for nob in the a pna photogranules fig s2 importantly distinct niches were gradually developed with reactor operation and granulation and the nrr improved with this process the a pna photogranules obtained at the end of the experiment achieved a two fold higher nrr than those without distinct niches from phases ii to iii fig 2b consequently the unique microstructure and distinct ecological niches within the cultivated a pna photogranules promoted nitrogen removal 4 2 metabolic cross feeding between bacterial and microalgae helps anammox bacteria survival cross feeding can expand the metabolic niche of bacteria and has been proven crucial for anammox bacteria oña et al 2021 zhao et al 2023 we found that both the abundant thauera sp tha1 and chlorella sp alg1 can contribute the necessary metabolites for ca brocadia amx7 according to metabolic reconstruction anammox bacteria are considered the primary suppliers of amino acids in the anammox granules lawson et al 2017 wang et al 2022 zhao et al 2018 here we propose that microalgae substituted anammox bacteria as suppliers of amino acids in a pna photogranules which helped anammox bacteria reduce the metabolic burden and adapt to light irradiation alg1 exhibited complete pathways for the biosynthesis of over 12 types of amino acids fig 5c and had considerably larger cell size than most bacteria fig 4h thus played a key role in supplying amino acid and cofactors to the bacterial community furthermore myx1 exhibited the maximum number of extracellular peptidases for hydrolyzing proteins from microalgae fig s5 contributing amino acids available to the entire microbial community the abundance of myx1 increased in s2 s5 which is consistent with the decreased pn concentration figs 1d and s5 conversely alg1 tends to produce more pn in exchange for the necessary growth factor vb12 from bacteria such as amx7 and tha1 therefore a stable metabolic interaction was established in the a pna system myx1 can hydrolyze the abundant pn from alg1 in a pna providing high cost amino acid to amx1 which may help reduce metabolic energy requirements cross feeding in eps formation is also essential for maintaining granular stability zhao et al 2018 and contributes to the protection of anammox bacteria under light irradiation members of the anammox community serve complementary functions in pn and ps formation ya et al 2022 it has been reported that algal eps would enrich whereas bacterial eps decays during the photogranulation process kuo dahab et al 2018 and the variation in algal abundance is consistent with the eps concentration fig 1d additionally chlorella had been reported produces more cell adhesive pn under higher light irradiation in wastewater chen et al 2021 hydrophobic pn are essential for the aggregation and stability of granules hou et al 2015 the abundant eps that overlapped microalgal cells on the granule surface as shown in the sem images fig 4f might play a crucial role in structural stability therefore the growth of wastewater borne microalgae could not only contribute essential amino acids to the entire bacterial community but also promote the stability of photogranules consequently metabolic cross feeding among the microbial groups helped maintain granular stability and resist unfavorable environments 4 3 flexible response of ca brocadia to light although a few studies have investigated coupled microalgal anammox processes the mechanism by which anammox bacteria respond to light remains unclear the microstructure and cross feeding in the proposed a pna granules reduced the impact of light on anammox bacteria however the anammox bacteria are directly exposed to light irradiation before the growth of microalgae so the light resistance ability of the bacteria played a more essential role in light adaptation we observed the dominant genera of the anammox bacteria shifted from ca jettenia to ca brocadia after irradiation and the niche breadth of ca brocadia was two fold higher than that of ca jetttenia in the photogranules fig s2 similarly another study demonstrated that ca brocadia fulgida was the only dominant anammox bacteria in the rhizosphere under natural light and its activity was promoted under a stable light intensity xiao et al 2021 these results suggest that ca brocadia has a unique mechanism of adaptation to light compared with ca jetttenia light sensing ability can help non photosynthetic bacteria to avoid damage by solar irradiation gomelsky and hoff 2011 we found that all reference genomes of ca brocadia contain a bacteriophytochrome like light sensing protein bph1 to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of anammox bacteria with light sensing abilities as one of the most abundant photoreceptors bacteriophytochromes can protect non photosynthetic bacteria from light irradiation davis et al 1999 although little is known about downstream intracellular signal transduction after photo sensing in most non photosynthetic bacteria a recent study demonstrated that bacteriophytochromes mediate the bacterial second messenger c di gmp and contribute to cell movement and colonization verma et al 2020 as c di gmp also regulates the aggregation capacity of anammox bacteria guo et al 2017 the light sensing ability of ca brocadia may be crucial for light adaptation and spatial positioning further promoting granular stability comparative genomic analysis revealed that compared to ca jettenia ca brocadia has more redundant functions in chemotaxis ros scavenging and flagellar assembly figs 6b and s7 oh and o2 have been identified as the primary ros for anammox bacteria under light irradiation ren et al 2022 and we found that the genes encoded in catalase for reducing these ros existed in all ca brocadia but were absent in some ca jettenia furthermore chemotaxis and cell mobility are essential for bacteria to identify an appropriate niche in an unfavorable environment raina et al 2019 the flagella of bacteria can sense unfavorable conditions and chemotaxis can improve the access of bacteria to beneficial environments raina et al 2019 in a study on anammox bacteria inhibited by oxygen exposure ca kuenenia responded to stress by rapid upregulation of flagellar assembly genes yan et al 2020 as the protein bph1 also regulated cell mobility verma et al 2020 ca brocadia may move towards the kernel of granules as defense against light inhibition therefore these findings indicated that low strength light 3000 6000 lux did not have irreversible negative effects on anammox bacteria and ca brocadia exhibited efficient adaptability to direct irradiation through light sensing cell movement ros scavenging it may be advantageous to inoculate the genus ca brocadia for the repaid stat up of the a pna system under light in addition this study only compared the light sensing ability of ca brocadia and ca jettenia whether light sensing protein existed in other kinds of anammox bacteria need further exploration 4 4 towards carbon negative and energy efficient nitrogen removal process currently mechanical aeration and additional carbon sources are generally required for stable nitrogen removal in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps leading to substantial emissions of greenhouse gasses reifsnyder et al 2021 therefore achieving carbon neutrality in wwtp highly depends on the nitrogen removal process we found that the proposed a pna process achieved a negative carbon emission of 139 mg co2 l d table 2 that is 0 47 kg co2 kg n removed whereas the pna phase produced co2 at a rate of 82 mg l d fig 7 a compared with the pna phase the a pna phase achieved a 3 6 fold lower energy consumption by using light energy as an alternative to mechanical aeration fig 7b and light irradiation achieved effective nob inhibition for stable nitrite accumulation nevertheless the co2 emission was estimated through the empirical formula of n removal process actual co2 emission was not measured as the reactor was not totally enclosed table 3 showed the comparison of nitrogen removal performance of other similar systems that were operated under conditions similar to those used in this study we observed that the nrr of most reported photogranule based systems was generally lower than 100 mg n l d and a long hrt or a high c n ratio was required for complete nitrogen removal ji et al 2020 manser et al 2016 trebuch et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a 2022b in contrast the a pna photogranules system proposed in this study showed superior nitrogen removal performance compared to those in previous studies with a relatively short hrt of 8 h and a reasonably high nrr of 294 mg n l d although the nrr was not so high compared with other pna system chen et al 2019 li et al 2021 the reduced energy consumption and carbon emission provided an alternative towards carbon neutrality in wastewater treatment the integration of nitrogen removal resource recovery and negative co2 emission in a single system demonstrated the resource efficient synergy between nutrients energy and carbon in the a pna photogranule process 5 conclusion a coupled a pna granular sludge process was developed to achieve low carbon nitrogen removal and explore the light adaptation mechanism of anammox bacteria the following conclusions were drawn i this process achieved an nrr of 294 5 mg n l d with a negative carbon emission of 0 47 kg co2 kg n removed the layered microstructure of the developed granules provides a sufficient niche for anammox bacteria and aob without any suitable niche for nob under light ii algal bacterial cross feeding on cofactors and eps formation within the granules contributed to granular stability and reduced the metabolic energy burden on anammox bacteria to facilitate light adaptation iii candidatus brocadia has light sensing potential and exhibits a flexible response to light irradiation including diverse dna repair ros scavenging and cell movement consequently the proposed a pna granular sludge process offers a feasible engineering approach for achieving sustainable wastewater treatment credit authorship contribution statement

14700,photogranules composed of algae nitrifiers and anammox bacteria are promising for nitrogen removal from wastewater with reduced aeration and carbon emissions however it is difficult to be achieved as the potential inhibition of anammox bacteria by light in this study a syntrophic algal partial nitrification anammox granular sludge process was developed with a nitrogen removal rate of 294 5 mg n l d we found the symbiosis in the community promoted the adaptation of anammox bacteria under light and cross feeding played an important role microalgae in the outer layers of photogranules sheltered most of the light and supplied cofactors and amino acids to promote nitrogen removal in particular myxococcota myx1 degraded the extracellular proteins produced by microalgae providing amino acids to the entire bacterial community which helped anammox bacteria save metabolic energy and adapt to light notably the anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia exhibited unique light sensing potential and adaptations to light irradiation compared with candidatus jettenia including diverse dna repair scavenging of reactive oxygen species cell movement the phytochrome like proteins encoded by candidatus brocadia further facilitated their spatial positioning and niche partitioning in photogranules this study provides insights into the response of anammox bacteria in the algae bacteria symbiosis system and suggests its potential application for carbon negative nitrogen removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nutrient removal and recovery anammox partial

national center for biotechnology information ncbi web site under bioproject prjna904676 1 introduction photogranule based systems are promising technologies for sustainable and low carbon wastewater treatment ji 2022 li et al 2022 algae as photosynthetic organisms can mitigate co2 emissions provide oxygen for nitrification and achieve resource recovery through biomass harvesting li et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a studies have shown that light promotes effective partial nitrification wang et al 2021 yang et al 2022a suggesting the applicability of a phototroph anammox symbiotic system for nitrogen removal manser et al 2016 yang et al 2022b zhang et al 2022b an algal partial nitrification anammox a pna system has been previously designed where microalgae produce oxygen to achieve effective nitrogen removal without aeration through the partial nitrification anammox pna process manser et al 2016 the combined a pna process can significantly reduce the costs associated with external carbon sources and aeration achieving effective autotrophic nitrogen removal with reduced carbon emissions during wastewater treatment zhang et al 2022b light is a key factor that promotes the growth of microalgae in algae bacteria symbiosis abs systems low strength light irradiation can stimulate the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and some denitrifiers but inhibit the growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob chu et al 2023 wang et al 2021 recently it was reported that light irradiation could significantly inhibit the anammox process by inducing the accumulation of intercellular reactive oxygen species ros in anammox bacteria ren et al 2022 however how anammox bacteria adapt to long term light irradiation remains elusive granulation is an important strategy through which anammox bacteria resist unfavorable environmental conditions gao et al 2021 where extracellular polymeric substances eps play a crucial role in maintaining granule stability although not systematically studied yet existing evidence suggests that metabolic interactions among bacteria could influence the synthesis of eps hosokawa et al 2021 ya et al 2022 zhao et al 2018 for instance acidobacteria affiliated chloroflexi affiliated bacteria and patescibacteria affiliated bacteria can facilitate the biosynthesis of sticky polysaccharides ps with precursors produced by anammox bacteria hosokawa et al 2021 ya et al 2022 additionally anammox bacteria can synthesize most amino acids to support other heterotrophs and affect the extracellular protein pn concentration lawson et al 2017 these metabolic interactions could further contribute to increased eps and particle size kong et al 2022 as larger granules support more diverse ecological niches chen et al 2020 the metabolic interaction within the a pna systems may contribute to eps formation and granulation providing an ecological niche for anammox bacteria in response to long term light irradiation microorganisms inhibited in bio granules exhibit emergent properties such as decreased energy consumption and enhanced stress tolerance karygianni et al 2020 cross feeding is a ubiquitous metabolic interaction in which microbes exchange metabolites with each other amin et al 2015 because most microalgae are cobalamin vitamin b12 or thiamin vitamin b1 auxotrophic they have to acquire these growth factors from symbiotic bacteria croft et al 2005 wu et al 2022 in contrast algae can provide fixed carbon for bacterial growth eps are biodegradable substances that act as sources of energy and amino acids for neighboring microorganisms karygianni et al 2020 during the transformation from activated sludge as to photogranules under light irradiation algae derived eps become dominant and act as public goods whereas bacteria derived eps gradually decays kuo dahab et al 2018 accordingly algae may be considered to supply energy by contributing amino acids to anammox bacteria and the entire community in the a pna system high intensity light is a threat to non phototrophic bacteria owing to its deleterious effects and photooxidative damage to nucleic acids and proteins van der horst et al 2007 to avoid damage by solar radiation many chemotrophic bacteria have evolved photoreceptor proteins that enable them to sense light gomelsky and hoff 2011 for instance bacteriophytochromes are one of the most abundant light sensing receptors davis et al 1999 xanthomonas which contains phytochromes can transform from a sessile into a free swimming motile lifestyle to avoid ultraviolet radiation verma et al 2020 additionally some studies have reported that anammox bacteria can adapt to light the marine anammox bacteria candidatus scalindua was able to resist ultraviolet light of 12 000 mj cm2 gao et al 2021 based on the aforementioned studies anammox bacteria may contain light sensing proteins to adapt to light and interact with wastewater borne microalgae to achieve stable autotrophic nitrogen removal in a single photobioreactor it is of great significance to gain further insight into the responses of anammox bacteria in long term light irradiation as well as the synergetic interactions among microorganisms in the a pna system in this study self sustaining a pna photogranules were developed using anammox granules as inoculum microbial samples were collected during different operational phases for metagenomic sequencing the aims of this study were to i develop a carbon negative autotrophic nitrogen removal process ii reveal the mechanisms by which functional microorganisms interact to effectively remove nitrogen and iii explore the adaptation mechanisms of anammox bacteria to long term light irradiation in photogranules this study can contribute to improved understanding of the assembly and interactions among microbial communities in abs systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation and sampling a sequence photobioreactor spbr effective

using the bradford method osnes et al 1993 and the phenol sulfuric acid method loewus 1952 respectively the methods for calculating the contribution of assimilation anammox and denitrification to nitrogen removal are described in the supplementary material text s2 oxygen concentration in the granules was determined using a clark type oxygen microsensor fitted to a motorizor at youngerusa xuyue

light sensing protein bph in amx7 were submitted to the genbank database accession number oq159016 2 7 estimation of co2 emissions and energy consumption to estimate the maximum co2 emission potential it was assumed that the carbon source in the influent was used for denitrification rather than microbial assimilation rittmann and mccarty 2003 the carbon emissions during the nitrogen removal process were estimated by stoichiometry in eqs 1 4 and the nitrogen removal contribution of each reaction eq 1 shows the n and co2 uptake by algal biomass rashid et al 2014 eq 2 estimates co2 uptake during the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite by autotrophic aob using standard half reactions assuming that the metabolic energy associated with cell synthesis fs is 0 14 rittmann and mccarty 2003 finally eqs

light irradiation from day 40 including increased chlorophyll a concentration increased granular size and decreased eps concentration fig 1 in phase i days 0 40 spherical pna granules were successfully developed with anammox granules as the inner core fig 1a during phase ii days 41 70 indigenous microalgae rapidly bloomed under a light intensity of 6000 lux fig 1a and the chlorophyll a concentration increased to a maximum of 14 3 mg l on day 68 microscopic observations revealed that some unicellular microalgae grew outside the pna granules fig 1a pn and ps rapidly increased to the maximum value on day 60 and subsequently decreased to 53 1 and 23 0 mg g vss on day 70 fig 1d during phases iii iv days 71 122 measures reduced light intensity and increased settling time were adopted to control algal growth table 1 the chlorophyll a concentration was successfully controlled in the range of 8 11 mg l in phase iv fig 1a similarly the pn and ps contents continuously decreased to minimum values of 29 4 mg g vss pn and 12 2 mg g vss ps respectively at the end of phase iv day 120 after increasing the nlr in phase v days 123 146 the chlorophyll a concentration slightly increased to 12 5 mg l and the mlss and average granular size reached 3 45 mg l and 410 µm respectively at the end of the experiment figs 1b and 1c elemental composition analysis revealed that a pna photogranules were composed of 42 21 carbon 5 91 hydrogen and 8 27 nitrogen by mass according to the empirical formula of microalgal biomass c5h8 9o1 8n0 6 for microalgae and c5h7o2n for mixed culture bacteria rittmann and mccarty 2003 the microalgal bacterial mass ratio in granules was determined to be approximately 3 5 3 2 nitrogen removal performance to explore the nitrogen removal performance of the a pna process the aeration rate variation in nitrogen species nitrogen loading rate nlr and nitrogen removal rate nrr are shown in fig 2 the removal performance steadily improved after inoculation achieving an nrr of 155 2 mg n l d at the end of phase i figs 2 b and 2c after light irradiation the nrr continuously increased to 183 0 mg n l d on day 55 fig 2c however the nrr substantially deteriorated from day 60 to a minimum of 69 1 mg n l d on day 69 the results indicated the instability of the a pna system after microalgal overgrowth to control algal growth the light intensity decreased to 3000 lux in phase iii and the nrr slowly recovered to 157 6 mg n l d on day 100 fig 2c at the end of the experiment the nrr of the reactor reached a maximum value of 294 5 mg n l d and the a pna granule based system could remove 94 6 nitrogen over a short hrt of 8 h under a c n ratio of 1 1 figs 2b and 2c additionally nitrate was nearly undetectable in the effluent throughout the experiment figs 2b and s1 3 3 population shift of anammox bacteria from ca jettenia to ca brocadia after light irradiation to explore the succession of the microbial community the short read based metagenomic classification was performed fig 3 at the phylum level proteobacteria bacteroidetes and planctomycetes were the dominant bacteria and chlorophyta was the most abundant algae in the reactor fig 3a at the end of the experiment the most dominant bacterial genera were thauera abundance of 46 3 nitrosomonas abundance of 10 4 and ca brocadia abundance of 1 2 figs 3b 3g notably the abundance of nitrospira exhibited a distinct downward trend across the entire experiment and decreased to 0 04 in s5 fig 3b wastewater borne chlorella was the most abundant algal genus accounting for 0 8 2 5 of the microbial community whereas other microalgae cyanobacteria were relatively rare 0 1 ca jettenia and ca brocadia were the dominant genera of anammox bacteria in phase i with relative abundances of 6 8 and 1 4 respectively in s1 figs 3g and 3f notably the dominant anammox bacteria shifted from ca jettania to ca brocadia after light irradiation the abundance of ca jettenia sharply decreased to 0 2 in s5 in contrast ca brocadia were almost unchanged 1 1 1 2 in s2 s5 figs 3g and 3f in a pna photogranules the niche breadth of ca brocadia was 4 6 whereas it was only 1 9 ca jettenia fig s2 suggesting a higher adaptability of ca brocadia to light in a photogranule based system 3 4 spatial association among microbes in the a pna photogranules to explore the spatial distribution of key n transforming microorganisms the microalgae aob anammox bacteria and thauera in a section of a pna photogranules were visualized using clsm fig 4 a all the microbes detected with dapi are shown in blue the specific anammox amx820 and aob populations nso190 are displayed in green fig 4b and orange fig 4c respectively moreover the microalgae were detected with red self fluorescence fig 4d most aob and algae were located in the surface layer of granules and formed a thick outer rim whereas most of the anammox bacteria agglomerated and were located in the kernel of the photogranules figs 4a 4d fig s3 shows the distribution of thauera in the granules where it spread across the entire section with a close spatial distance to the microalgae the normalized fluorescence intensity of microalgae and aob rapidly decreased from the granule surface to the kernel figs 4c and 4d whereas that of anammox bacteria increased fig 4b the prevalence of diverse n transforming microorganisms suggests that distinct ecological niches and close microbial interactions exist in the photogranules over 10 fish images were analyzed to determine the proportions of anammox bacteria aob microalgae and thauera in the total microbial community the results showed that anammox bacteria accounted for an average of 17 7 of the microbial community whereas aob microalgae and thauera accounted for 11 7 8 4 and 34 2 respectively the discrepancy in the metagenomic abundance of anammox bacteria might be caused by small flocs that were unaccounted for indicating that photogranules with layered structure could provide a sufficient niche for anammox bacteria additionally sem demonstrated that microalgae primarily aggregated in the outer layer of the granules figs 4e 4h enclosing the internal bacterial biomass fig 4g and algal cells were tightly wrapped by the abundant eps on the granule surface fig 4f 3 5 synergetic metabolic interaction within the microbial community the microsensor measurement demonstrated that oxygen concentration rapidly decreased from the surface to the kernel in the granules fig s4 the oxygen concentration was 95 2 µmol l at a distance of 160 µm away from the granular surface and o2 limitation happened in the 240 µm depth from the granular surface fig 5 a based on the microsensor measurement clsm and sem images a microstructure was proposed for the a pna photogranules fig 5a microalgae in the outer layer can provide oxygen for aob and shelter light for anammox bacteria a portion of the influent nh4 could be oxidized by mid layer aob to no2 which was then used by the anammox bacteria in the kernel of the granule to further investigate the potential metabolic interactions among microbes in a pna photogranules the partial metabolic pathways of the key mags with average abundances 1 were proposed figs 5b and 5c they included chlorella sp alg1 thauera sp tha1 nitrosomonas sp aob1 myxococcota bacterium sp myx1 and candidatus brocadia sp amx7 the details of their genomes and relative abundances are provided in table s1 and fig s5 notably significant discrepancies in metabolic potential were observed among the different species vitamin b12 vb12 is necessary for the growth of most microalgae including b12 auxotrophs and alg1 croft et al 2005 interestingly both amx7 and tha1 exhibited synthetic pathways for vb12 synthesis figs 5b and s3 the abundance of tha1 with a close spatial distance to alg also increased during the operation fig s5 as return alg1 provided thiamine vb1 folate and pyridoxal phosphate to amx7 and tha1 as inferred from their metabolic potentials fig 5c additionally tha1 had the potential to provide molybdopterin cofactor moco and folate to amx7 fig 5b these are essential co factors that promote the activity of anammox bacteria ya et al 2022 zhao et al 2018 therefore potential metabolic cross feeds are essential for their coexistence and nitrogen removal capability amino acids have been characterized as important metabolite intermediates that shape microbial community assembly mee et al 2014 the abundant microalga alg1 exhibited the complete pathway for the synthesis of most amino acids with high metabolic costs e g phenylalanine and tyrosine as these amino acids were absent in most of the bacterial mags including amx7 they might obtain these amino acids from alg1 fig 5c pn degradation is another source of amino acids in microbial communities lawson et al 2017 notably myx1 encoded the maximum peptides and transporters and might be the dominant extracellular protein degrader in the photogranules fig s5 thus myx1 hydrolyzed pn from microalgae in a pna photogranules to high cost amino acids to the entire bacterial community which facilitated anammox bacteria to reduce metabolic energy myx1 as a high abundance about 11 fig s5 bacteria can also participate in partial denitrification of the nitrite loop in a pna photogranules fig 5c indicating that the nitrate generated from anammox bacteria can be reduced to nitrite by myx1 and reused by anammox bacteria 3 6 comparative genomic analysis reveal unique light sensing protein existed in ca brocadia comparative genomic analysis of ca brocadia and ca jettenia was performed fig 6 for characterizing the unique function correlating with the light adaptation of ca brocadia although a large number 1259 of the same functional genes were shared by the two anammox bacterial genera ca brocadia had 168 unique genes compared to ca jettenia fig 6a examination of these genes based on their cog functional categories revealed that ca brocadia differed considerably in cell motility replication and repair amino acid transport and metabolism energy consumption and conversion fig 6a indicating that these functions may play an essential role in the light adaptation of ca brocadia in particular ca brocadia has key genes in the repair of dna damage caused by light irradiation or ros truglio et al 2006 including dna mismatch repair muts and mutl and the uvrabc repair system fig 6b cristóvão et al 2012 truglio et al 2006 additionally the key ros defense genes kat sod2 and sora were detected in the six genomes of ca brocadia but were incomplete in some ca jettenia moreover genes related to chemotaxis che and flagellar assembly flg flh and fli were absent in all ca jettenia but were present in ca brocadia fig 6b thus ca brocadia exhibited more flexible cell mobility than ca jettenia facilitating its movement towards favorable environments and may affect niche differentiation fig s2 notably all genomes of ca brocadia encoded a phytochrome like protein bph which is a light sensing receptor involved in regulating diverse cellular processes fig 6b bhoo et al 2001 whereas this protein was absent in ca jettenia strong sequence homology was identified between previously reported bph sequences from different bacteria fig 6c davis et al 1999 the phytochrome like proteins in ca brocadia and the reference sequences contained an amino terminal chromophore binding domain followed by a histidine kinase module bhoo et al 2001 figs 6c and s6 suggesting that these proteins function as light activated kinases similar to other two component sensing systems west and stock 2001 4 discussion 4 1 niche differentiation in a pna photogranules favoring nitrogen removal the abs system is a promising low carbon and sustainable approach for wastewater treatment which has been extensively studied ji 2022 li et al 2022 a major limitation of this approach is the inhibition of functional bacteria particularly anammox bacteria by external light ren et al 2022 in this study a self sustaining a pna photogranule sludge process was developed using anammox granules and short cut as as inoculum the reactor was operated for 40 d before light irradiation was applied to prevent direct light exposure in anammox bacteria using this inoculation and start up strategy a pna photogranules with unique microstructures were successfully developed clsm and sem revealed distinct layers and ecological niches in the photogranules and the niche differentiation were attributed to their distinct sensitivities and responses to light microalgae require light for photosynthesis therefore they are located in the outermost layer fig 4d aob are primarily located in the mid outer layer because they require oxygen and favor low intensity light fig 4c wang et al 2021 yang et al 2022a the close spatial distance 10 µm between microalgae and aob could also achieve effective oxygen transfer promoting aob activity fig 4a do production at the surface and depletion of the kernel might be key factors in the formation of this unique structure additionally the dominant anammox bacteria amx7 exhibited light sensing ability and cell mobility facilitating their movement towards the kernel thus anammox bacteria were at a relatively long distance 50 µm from the granule surface fig 4b and the surface coverage of microalgae prevented the inhibition of anammox bacteria by light owing to this structure only a small fraction of the light can pass through the eps and gas channels to the kernel therefore layered a pna photogranules with sufficient anoxic aerobic areas could provide adequate niches for anammox bacteria in the granules fig s2 furthermore the specific structure of developed photogranules and the niche separation between aob and nob also contributed to stable partial nitrification the aob activity improved by 35 in phase v compared to phase i fig s1 whereas nob was nearly undetectable in phase v fig 3b this is consistent with the findings of a previous study showing that low intensity light stimulated aob activity while inhibiting nob growth wang et al 2021 as aerobic bacteria nob tend to grow in the outer layer of a pna granules similar to aob nevertheless external light is a threat to the surface nob thus no proper ecological niches were available for nob in the a pna photogranules fig s2 importantly distinct niches were gradually developed with reactor operation and granulation and the nrr improved with this process the a pna photogranules obtained at the end of the experiment achieved a two fold higher nrr than those without distinct niches from phases ii to iii fig 2b consequently the unique microstructure and distinct ecological niches within the cultivated a pna photogranules promoted nitrogen removal 4 2 metabolic cross feeding between bacterial and microalgae helps anammox bacteria survival cross feeding can expand the metabolic niche of bacteria and has been proven crucial for anammox bacteria oña et al 2021 zhao et al 2023 we found that both the abundant thauera sp tha1 and chlorella sp alg1 can contribute the necessary metabolites for ca brocadia amx7 according to metabolic reconstruction anammox bacteria are considered the primary suppliers of amino acids in the anammox granules lawson et al 2017 wang et al 2022 zhao et al 2018 here we propose that microalgae substituted anammox bacteria as suppliers of amino acids in a pna photogranules which helped anammox bacteria reduce the metabolic burden and adapt to light irradiation alg1 exhibited complete pathways for the biosynthesis of over 12 types of amino acids fig 5c and had considerably larger cell size than most bacteria fig 4h thus played a key role in supplying amino acid and cofactors to the bacterial community furthermore myx1 exhibited the maximum number of extracellular peptidases for hydrolyzing proteins from microalgae fig s5 contributing amino acids available to the entire microbial community the abundance of myx1 increased in s2 s5 which is consistent with the decreased pn concentration figs 1d and s5 conversely alg1 tends to produce more pn in exchange for the necessary growth factor vb12 from bacteria such as amx7 and tha1 therefore a stable metabolic interaction was established in the a pna system myx1 can hydrolyze the abundant pn from alg1 in a pna providing high cost amino acid to amx1 which may help reduce metabolic energy requirements cross feeding in eps formation is also essential for maintaining granular stability zhao et al 2018 and contributes to the protection of anammox bacteria under light irradiation members of the anammox community serve complementary functions in pn and ps formation ya et al 2022 it has been reported that algal eps would enrich whereas bacterial eps decays during the photogranulation process kuo dahab et al 2018 and the variation in algal abundance is consistent with the eps concentration fig 1d additionally chlorella had been reported produces more cell adhesive pn under higher light irradiation in wastewater chen et al 2021 hydrophobic pn are essential for the aggregation and stability of granules hou et al 2015 the abundant eps that overlapped microalgal cells on the granule surface as shown in the sem images fig 4f might play a crucial role in structural stability therefore the growth of wastewater borne microalgae could not only contribute essential amino acids to the entire bacterial community but also promote the stability of photogranules consequently metabolic cross feeding among the microbial groups helped maintain granular stability and resist unfavorable environments 4 3 flexible response of ca brocadia to light although a few studies have investigated coupled microalgal anammox processes the mechanism by which anammox bacteria respond to light remains unclear the microstructure and cross feeding in the proposed a pna granules reduced the impact of light on anammox bacteria however the anammox bacteria are directly exposed to light irradiation before the growth of microalgae so the light resistance ability of the bacteria played a more essential role in light adaptation we observed the dominant genera of the anammox bacteria shifted from ca jettenia to ca brocadia after irradiation and the niche breadth of ca brocadia was two fold higher than that of ca jetttenia in the photogranules fig s2 similarly another study demonstrated that ca brocadia fulgida was the only dominant anammox bacteria in the rhizosphere under natural light and its activity was promoted under a stable light intensity xiao et al 2021 these results suggest that ca brocadia has a unique mechanism of adaptation to light compared with ca jetttenia light sensing ability can help non photosynthetic bacteria to avoid damage by solar irradiation gomelsky and hoff 2011 we found that all reference genomes of ca brocadia contain a bacteriophytochrome like light sensing protein bph1 to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of anammox bacteria with light sensing abilities as one of the most abundant photoreceptors bacteriophytochromes can protect non photosynthetic bacteria from light irradiation davis et al 1999 although little is known about downstream intracellular signal transduction after photo sensing in most non photosynthetic bacteria a recent study demonstrated that bacteriophytochromes mediate the bacterial second messenger c di gmp and contribute to cell movement and colonization verma et al 2020 as c di gmp also regulates the aggregation capacity of anammox bacteria guo et al 2017 the light sensing ability of ca brocadia may be crucial for light adaptation and spatial positioning further promoting granular stability comparative genomic analysis revealed that compared to ca jettenia ca brocadia has more redundant functions in chemotaxis ros scavenging and flagellar assembly figs 6b and s7 oh and o2 have been identified as the primary ros for anammox bacteria under light irradiation ren et al 2022 and we found that the genes encoded in catalase for reducing these ros existed in all ca brocadia but were absent in some ca jettenia furthermore chemotaxis and cell mobility are essential for bacteria to identify an appropriate niche in an unfavorable environment raina et al 2019 the flagella of bacteria can sense unfavorable conditions and chemotaxis can improve the access of bacteria to beneficial environments raina et al 2019 in a study on anammox bacteria inhibited by oxygen exposure ca kuenenia responded to stress by rapid upregulation of flagellar assembly genes yan et al 2020 as the protein bph1 also regulated cell mobility verma et al 2020 ca brocadia may move towards the kernel of granules as defense against light inhibition therefore these findings indicated that low strength light 3000 6000 lux did not have irreversible negative effects on anammox bacteria and ca brocadia exhibited efficient adaptability to direct irradiation through light sensing cell movement ros scavenging it may be advantageous to inoculate the genus ca brocadia for the repaid stat up of the a pna system under light in addition this study only compared the light sensing ability of ca brocadia and ca jettenia whether light sensing protein existed in other kinds of anammox bacteria need further exploration 4 4 towards carbon negative and energy efficient nitrogen removal process currently mechanical aeration and additional carbon sources are generally required for stable nitrogen removal in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps leading to substantial emissions of greenhouse gasses reifsnyder et al 2021 therefore achieving carbon neutrality in wwtp highly depends on the nitrogen removal process we found that the proposed a pna process achieved a negative carbon emission of 139 mg co2 l d table 2 that is 0 47 kg co2 kg n removed whereas the pna phase produced co2 at a rate of 82 mg l d fig 7 a compared with the pna phase the a pna phase achieved a 3 6 fold lower energy consumption by using light energy as an alternative to mechanical aeration fig 7b and light irradiation achieved effective nob inhibition for stable nitrite accumulation nevertheless the co2 emission was estimated through the empirical formula of n removal process actual co2 emission was not measured as the reactor was not totally enclosed table 3 showed the comparison of nitrogen removal performance of other similar systems that were operated under conditions similar to those used in this study we observed that the nrr of most reported photogranule based systems was generally lower than 100 mg n l d and a long hrt or a high c n ratio was required for complete nitrogen removal ji et al 2020 manser et al 2016 trebuch et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a 2022b in contrast the a pna photogranules system proposed in this study showed superior nitrogen removal performance compared to those in previous studies with a relatively short hrt of 8 h and a reasonably high nrr of 294 mg n l d although the nrr was not so high compared with other pna system chen et al 2019 li et al 2021 the reduced energy consumption and carbon emission provided an alternative towards carbon neutrality in wastewater treatment the integration of nitrogen removal resource recovery and negative co2 emission in a single system demonstrated the resource efficient synergy between nutrients energy and carbon in the a pna photogranule process 5 conclusion a coupled a pna granular sludge process was developed to achieve low carbon nitrogen removal and explore the light adaptation mechanism of anammox bacteria the following conclusions were drawn i this process achieved an nrr of 294 5 mg n l d with a negative carbon emission of 0 47 kg co2 kg n removed the layered microstructure of the developed granules provides a sufficient niche for anammox bacteria and aob without any suitable niche for nob under light ii algal bacterial cross feeding on cofactors and eps formation within the granules contributed to granular stability and reduced the metabolic energy burden on anammox bacteria to facilitate light adaptation iii candidatus brocadia has light sensing potential and exhibits a flexible response to light irradiation including diverse dna repair ros scavenging and cell movement consequently the proposed a pna granular sludge process offers a feasible engineering approach for achieving sustainable wastewater treatment credit authorship contribution statement

14701,aromatic polyamide pa based membranes are widely used for reverse osmosis ro but they can be degraded by free chlorine used for controlling the biofouling prior to ro treatment kinetics and mechanisms for the reactions of pa membrane model monomers i e benzanilide ba and acetanilide ac with chlorine dioxide clo2 were investigated in this study rate constants for the reactions of clo2 with ba and ac at ph 8 3 and 21 c were determined to be 4 1 0 1 10 1 m 1 24 s 1 and 6 0 0 1 10 3 m 1 s 1 respectively these reactions are base assisted with a strong ph dependence the activation energies of ba and ac degradation by clo2 were 123 7 and 81 0 kj mol 1 respectively this indicates a relatively strong temperature dependence in the studied temperature range of 21 35 c the presence of bromide and natural organic matter does not promote the degradation of model monomers by clo2 ba was degraded by clo2 via two pathways 1 the attack on the anilide moiety with the formation of benzamide major pathway and 2 oxidative hydrolysis to benzoic acid minor pathway a kinetic model was developed to simulate the degradation of ba and formation of byproducts during clo2 pretreatment and simulations agree well with the experimental data half lives of ba treated by clo2 were 1 5 orders of magnitude longer than chlorine under typical seawater treatment conditions these novel findings suggest the potential application of clo2 for controlling biofouling ahead of ro treatment at desalination treatments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine dioxide benzanilide acetanilide kinetics degradation pathways polyamide membrane data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the high water permeability high selectivity and wide ph tolerance range of aromatic polyamide pa thin film composite membranes make them an ideal choice for reverse osmosis ro in seawater desalination or water reuse werber et al 2016 the operational stability and economy of ro units are however limited by membrane biofouling misdan et al 2012 currently biofouling is controlled by adding disinfectants such as chlorine in the form of hypochlorous acid hocl while free chlorine is effective in inhibiting microbial growth it can attack the pa active layer as a result changes in membrane permeability reduced permselectivity and membrane failure were observed geise et al 2011 kang et al 2007 kwon et al 2006 in practice most commercial polyamide based membranes have low tolerance limits for free chlorine therefore residual chlorine should be removed before the influent water reaches the ro membrane by applying sodium bisulfite reduction nevertheless biofouling continues to be a problem additionally median bromide concentrations in seawater are c a 67 mg l flury and papritz 1993 chlorine pretreatment during seawater desalination can convert free chlorine to free bromine which can react with natural organic matter nom and thus form highly toxic brominated disinfection byproducts dbps agus and sedlak 2010 kim et al 2015 le roux et al 2015 liu et al 2022 recent studies indicated that the removal efficiencies of some dbps with low molecular weight such as trihalomethanes haloacetonitriles generally were relatively low 50 zeng et al 2016 therefore the formation of dbps during chlorine pretreatment for seawater desalination might pose adverse effects to human health and ecosystems with the objective to control biofouling while reducing the damage of the pa membrane active layer and formation of halogenated dbps chlorine dioxide clo2 has been proposed as an alternative oxidant for the pretreatment of seawater in desalination processes adams 1990 maugin 2013 oh and jang 2016 lab scale studies showed that clo2 exposed membrane exhibited excellent performance in terms of permeate flux and salt rejection alayemieka and lee 2012 koh and jang 2017 clo2 which is a strong oxidant can effectively remove algae inactivate planktonic bacteria and certain chlorine resistant pathogens chauret et al 2001 junli et al 1997 its disinfection efficiency is equal or even superior to chlorine which makes clo2 a suitable alternative gagnon et al 2004 moreover clo2 reacts via electron transfer and thus the formation of halogenated dbps is typically much lower than free chlorine liu et al 2013 in addition the formation of brominated dbps in seawater pretreatment by clo2 is low since the reaction rate constant between clo2 and bromide is small 10 4 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1994 nevertheless clo2 forms inorganic byproducts e g chlorite and chlorate upon its reaction with water constituents with a yield of 50 to 70 for chlorite schmidt et al 2000 considering chlorite being regulated at a maximum contaminant level mcl of 1 mg l by the us environmental protection agency us epa u s environmental protection agency 2006 the dosage of clo2 in water treatment is usually less than 2 mg l acetanilide ac and benzanilide ba are model monomers for the pa membrane it was reported that chlorine can attack ba through n chlorination ring chlorination or orton rearrangement huang et al 2019 soice et al 2003 nevertheless the reactions between these model compounds e g ac and ba and clo2 have not been studied there was still a lack of information about the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of model monomers in addition water matrix nom and bromide and operating parameters ph and temperature may affect the reactions of clo2 with membrane model monomers for example nom is a possible fouling deposit which can lead to high operating pressure and energy consumption the qualitative and quantitative data of model compound degradation and byproduct formation during the clo2 oxidation process will allow assessing the membrane resistance to oxidants with respect to seawater pretreatment the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the kinetics for the reactions of clo2 with model monomers under various water treatment influencing factors 2 identify degradation products and propose reaction mechanisms 3 develop a kinetic model to predict the degradation of model monomers and the formation of transformation byproducts during clo2 pretreatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents all chemical solutions were prepared from reagent grade chemicals or stock solutions using double deionized ddi water 18 2 mω cm 21 c details on commercially available standards and reagents are provided in text s1 of supplementary material stock solutions of ba and ac were prepared at 10 mm in acetonitrile preliminary experiments show that acetonitrile does not react with clo2 suwannee river nom isolate cat no 2r101n was obtained from the international humic substances society we chose to use commercially available nom isolates since they have been widely used as references in literature also their chemical properties are known and interferences from other components of water matrices can be avoided stock solutions of clo2 were prepared with bubbling gaseous clo2 to ddi waters by adding diluted h2so4 slowly to naclo2 solutions liu et al 2013 the saturated naclo2 scrubber removes impurities such as chlorine from the gas stream and the gaseous clo2 in a stable n2 gas stream enters the ddi water it was quantified spectrophotometrically with a molar absorption coefficient of 1230 m 1 cm 1 at 359 nm and stored away from light at 4 c until use furman and margerum 1998 2 2 analytical methods concentrations of residual clo2 was analyzed spectrophotometrically using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method at 515 nm on a uv visible spectrophotometer apha 1998 concentrations of model compounds and their possible transformation byproducts were measured by a thermo vanquish high performance liquid chromatograph hplc equipped with a c18 column 2 1 mm 100 mm 3 μm with a flow rate of 0 2 ml min for ba analysis the mobile phase consisted of 0 1 formic acid in water 50 and methanol 50 while it was 80 water and 20 acetonitrile for the analyses of ac for the quantification of transformation product benzoic acid the mobile phase consisted of 50 water 10 mm phosphoric acid and 50 methanol and the composition for p benzoquinone was 80 water 0 1 formic acid and 20 methanol the wavelengths used for the measurement of ba ac benzoic acid and p benzoquinone on the uv detector were 260 238 227 and 254 nm with retention times of 9 1 2 4 4 8 4 5 min respectively sample injection volumes for ba ac benzoic acid and p benzoquinone were 10 10 50 and 50 µl with quantification limits of 0 05 0 05 0 05 and 0 02 µm respectively 2 3 reaction kinetics of model monomers with clo2 the roles of initial clo2 concentration ph temperature bromide and nom on the reaction kinetics of model monomers and clo2 were investigated the initial clo2 concentration ranged from 50 to 200 μm and the ph values were adjusted to 7 8 8 3 8 6 and 9 0 with 10 mm phosphate ph 7 0 or borate buffer ph 8 0 9 0 no significant change of ph 0 1 was observed during the reaction temperature of reaction solutions ranged from 20 to 35 c initial concentrations of bromide and nom were 0 800 µm and 0 2 mg l respectively all experiments were performed in brown glass vials in the dark reactions were initiated by the addition of clo2 stock solution to the buffered model monomer solutions samples were withdrawn at pre selected time intervals residual clo2 was analyzed by the dpd method for the measurement of model compounds and their transformation products samples were immediately purged with n2 gas to remove the residual clo2 preliminary experiments indicated that n2 blowing did not affect the concentrations of ba or ac figure s1 each experiment was conducted at least in duplicate 2 4 byproduct identification to qualify the transformation products of the reaction of model monomers with clo2 at ph 8 3 10 mm borate buffer and 21 c initial concentrations of clo2 and ba were 200 and 1 μm respectively samples were withdrawn regularly and purged with n2 gas to remove the residual clo2 for the analyses of semi volatile compounds water samples were subjected to a liquid liquid extraction briefly 2 4 ml volume of methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and 10 g of pre dried sodium sulfate were added to 40 ml of samples 40 ml the mtbe extracts were analyzed using an agilent 8890 gas chromatograph gc coupled with an agilent 5977 mass spectrometry ms detector samples 1 µl were injected at 180 c onto an hp 5ms 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 µm column the oven program was held at 80 c for 1 min ramped to 240 c at 10 c min and then hold at 240 c for 4 min additionally water sample acidification and methylation were performed for the identification of transformation products with carboxylic acid groups in brief a 40 ml volume of sample was adjusted to ph 1 using concentrated sulfuric acid and extracted with 3 2 ml of mtbe the mtbe extracts were converted to their methyl esters by the addition of 1 ml of 10 h2so4 methanol solution in a water bath at 50 c for 2 h the extracts are neutralized with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate the mtbe extracts were analyzed by gc ms the oven program was held at 35 c for 6 min and then ramped to 220 c at a rate of 10 c min and then held at 240 c for 0 min the ms detector was operated in the electron ionization mode at 70 ev the quantification of acetic acid formed from the reaction between ac and clo2 was performed using a thermo aquion ion chromatograph ic with an online koh eluent generator the sample was eluted by 5 mm koh through a 25 µl loop injection at a flow rate of 1 ml min through an ionpac as11 column the quantification limit was 0 5 µm 2 5 kinetic modelling model calculations to simulate the degradation of model monomers and formation of transformation byproduct during oxidation processes under various water treatment conditions were performed using the software kintecus ianni 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction order and rate constants of model monomers with clo2 the reactions of model monomers with clo2 under various initial concentrations were investigated at ph 8 3 borate buffer under pseudo first order conditions i e at least a 10 1 molar ratio of clo2 to model compounds in a batch reactor fig 1 and figure s2 in the absence of clo2 concentrations of model monomers remained unchanged in 48 h figure s3 increasing the initial concentrations of clo2 led to an increase in the degradation rate of model monomers the reaction between model compounds and clo2 can be written as follows 1 model compound ncl o 2 prod ucts under the pseudo first order conditions the rate of ba or ac degradation can be simplified to eqs 2 and 3 2 d model compound dt k model compound and 3 in k k n ln cl o 2 o where k represents pseudo first order reaction rate constants and k denotes apparent reaction rate constants a plot of ln k vs ln clo2 0 will yield a straight line accordingly with the slope denoting n i e the stoichiometric number a plot of ln k vs ln clo2 0 for the reactions of ac with clo2 gives a linear curve with the slope i e n almost equaling 1 0 fig 1d thus the reaction between ac and clo2 was of second order in total and first order with respect to each reactant nevertheless a plot of ln k vs ln clo2 0 for the reactions of ba with clo2 gives a slope of 1 24 fig 1c indicating that the reaction order with respect to clo2 was higher than one this may be due to the fact that the decay of clo2 follows mixed order or second order kinetics napolitano et al 2006 stewart et al 2008 based on eq 3 and the intercepts in fig 1c and d the k values for the reactions of clo2 with ba and ac at ph 8 3 and 21 c were calculated to be 4 1 0 1 10 1 m 1 24 s 1 and 6 0 0 1 10 3 m 1 s 1 respectively which are generally lower than those with chlorine 7 6 0 2 101 m 1 s 1 huang et al 2019 based on the small reaction rate constants of clo2 with model monomers for the pa membrane the use of clo2 as a disinfectant in seawater pretreatment could be an attractive alternative 3 2 effect of ph additional experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of ph on the degradation of model monomers over a ph range of 7 0 9 0 fig 2 and figure s4 mimicking possible ph adjustments in the treatment train the k for the reactions of clo2 with both ba and ac increased as ph increased assuming the stoichiometric ratio of clo2 oxidation of ba to be 1 24 clo2 per 1 ba over the ph range of 7 0 9 0 the k values can be calculated according to eq 4 4 k k c l o 2 o 1 24 the obtained k values for the reaction between ba and clo2 increased from 3 4 0 4 10 2 to 3 1 m 1 24 s 1 when ph increased from 7 0 to 9 0 at 21 c table s1 under the same conditions the k for the reaction between ac and clo2 increased from 5 0 0 7 10 4 to 3 9 10 2 m 1 s 1 table s1 a plot of the apparent reaction rate constants versus oh fig 2c and d is characterized by a nearly linear correlation with slopes of 3 1 105 and 3 9 103 for ba and ac respectively amides dissociate and form negatively charged ions with a pka of c a 14 it is likely that clo2 is highly reactive with the deprotonated species abdighahroudi et al 2022 hoigné and bader 1994 regarding seawater pretreatment for ro it can be concluded that a low ph 8 is beneficial to minimize the pa membrane damage by clo2 chlorite which is the major inorganic product from clo2 pretreatment is practically unreactive with model monomers in the studied ph range it was also reported that the presence of chlorite 100 mg l didn t affect the performance of the pa ro membrane ferrero et al 2007 3 3 effect of temperature temperature effects on the reactions of model monomers with clo2 at ph 8 3 were investigated over a range of 21 to 35 c fig 3 and figure s5 in the absence of clo2 concentrations of model monomers under various temperatures remained unchanged in 48 h figure s3 the degradation rates of both ba and ac increased with increases in temperature higher temperatures facilitate the degradation of ba and ac by clo2 when the temperature increased from 21 c to 35 c k for the reaction of clo2 with ba increased from 9 7 10 6 to 7 2 10 5 s 1 while k for the reaction of clo2 with ac increased from 1 4 10 6 to 5 0 10 6 s 1 a linearized arrhenius equation eq 5 has been used to calculate the activation energy by means of the reaction rate constants at different temperatures 5 i n k i n a e a r t where ea activation energy r molar gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and t degree k and a preexponential factor plotting ln k vs 1 t would yield a linear curve and the slope gives ea r fig 3c and d the ea values for the reactions of clo2 with ba and ac at ph 8 3 are calculated to be 123 7 and 81 0 kj mol 1 respectively according to these values a 5 c temperature increase results in increases of reaction rate constant for ba and ac by a factor of around 2 3 and 1 7 respectively 3 4 effect of nom and bromide the effect of different concentrations of nom on the degradation of model monomers was investigated figure s6 increasing the concentrations of nom increased the decay of clo2 since nom can compete with ba or ac for clo2 liu et al 2013 as a result lower oxidant exposure in the presence of nom led to lower degradation rates of ba or ac recent studies showed that the reaction of clo2 with nom can lead to the in situ formation of free chlorine with a yield up to 27 rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 since free chlorine reacts faster with ba than clo2 does the potential enhancement of secondarily formed chlorine is of interest additional experiments clo2 0 13 8 μm ba 0 50 μm ph 8 3 indicate that the presence of 2 mg l nom isolate does not enhance the degradation of ba figure s7 no chlorinated products were identified by gc ms figure s8 implying an insignificant role of free chlorine in this study this is likely due to the rapid consumption of free chlorine by nom zhu and zhang 2016 figure s9 presents the effect of initial bromide concentrations on the reactions between model monomers and clo2 the decay of clo2 and degradation of model monomers under various concentrations of bromide are almost identical this can be explained by the fact that clo2 does not react with bromide to form free bromine 10 4 m 1 s 1 hoigné and bader 1994 given that free bromine has a higher reaction rate constant with ba than chlorine does huang et al 2021 our findings indicate that unlike chlorination the presence of high concentrations of bromide may not enhance the degradation of pa membrane in clo2 pretreatment 3 5 byproduct identification further efforts have been made to identify the transformation byproducts during clo2 treatment of pa membrane model monomers figure s10 shows the typical gc ms chromatograms of the water samples containing ba treated by clo2 based on the chromatograms compound b1 with retention time rt of 8 62 min and molecular weight mw of 121 was identified to be benzamide figure s11 to further identify the potential products with carboxylic groups oxidized ba samples were acidified and methylated compound b2 with a molecular ion of m z 136 is the methylated product of benzoic acid figure s11 these products were further confirmed by the injections of individual standards in addition the formation of p benzoquinone was confirmed by hplc results shown later fig 4 shows the evolution of the concentrations of benzanilide and its transformation products during clo2 oxidation in ddi water results indicated that benzamide and p benzoquinone were the major products while the formation of benzoic acid was minor during the reaction course the degradation of ba led to the formation of benzamide and benzoic acid which accounted for approximately 80 and 10 with respect to the mass balance respectively the two products accumulated with time while for p benzoquinone after the maximum formation was reached at about 30 h the p benzoquinone concentration decreased as a function of the reaction time these findings agree with the undermentioned result that p benzoquinone can further react with clo2 previous studies showed halogenated benzanilide e g n chloro n phenylbenzamide n 4 chlorophenyl benzamide n 4 bromophenyl benzamide etc as the primary products during chlorination bromination of benzanilide huang et al 2019 huang et al 2021 however nonhalogenated intermediates such as benzamide benzoic acid and p benzoquinone were first identified as byproducts and quantified during the oxidation of benzanilide in this study this implies that benzanilide reacts with clo2 via a distinct pathway as compared to chlorine a mass balance ranging from 90 to 110 which was calculated from the mean concentrations of benzanilide benzamide and benzoic acid at various reaction times infers that the major byproducts have been accounted for in this work additional experiments were performed to investigate the reaction rate constants of ba transformation products with clo2 figure s12 results indicate that benzamide and benzoic acid do not react with clo2 under the experimental conditions in this study nevertheless p benzoquinone can undergo hydrolysis with a rate constant of 1 4 10 6 s 1 figure s12 the second order reaction rate constant between p benzoquinone and clo2 was determined to be 1 0 10 2 m 1 s 1 which was higher than that reported by a previous study 5 10 3 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 tratnyek and hoigné 1994 attempts were also made to identify the potential products formed during oxidation of ac by clo2 yet only a few products were identified the formation of p benzoquinone was below the limit of quantification of 0 2 µm figure s13 shows that the concentration of acetic acid increased as a function of reaction time a yield of 15 for acetic acid was observed and thus the formation of acetic acid was a minor pathway this is similar to the case for ba where benzoic acid formation is minor 3 6 proposed reaction mechanisms based on the identified transformation products and their reaction rate constants with clo2 a mechanism for the reaction of clo2 with ba is proposed scheme 1 the degradation of benzanilide was mainly initiated by the attack of clo2 on the anilide moiety 80 the oxidative attack led to the cleavage of c n bond and the subsequent formation of benzamide and phenol the latter form could be proposed as an intermediate however owing to the high apparent reaction rate constant between phenol and clo2 0 5 106 m 1s 1 at ph 8 0 hoigné and bader 1994 the half live of phenol was 7 10 3 s in this study and thus the steady state concentration of phenol was too low to be detected the subsequent oxidation of phenol yields p benzoquinone which can be further oxidized to ring cleavage products gan et al 2020 additionally the oxidative hydrolysis of ba in the presence of clo2 led to the formation of benzoic acid and aniline which is a minor pathway 10 the formation of p benzoquinone was a major product from aniline oxidation by clo2 via several intermediates e g iminoquinone aguilar et al 2014 likewise aniline was not detected because of its high apparent reaction rate of with clo2 4 5 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 9 huie and neta 1986 to better understand the multiple step reactions of benzanilide with clo2 a kinetic model was developed to fit the experimental data obtained at various reaction times this kinetic model is given in model s1 and model calculations were performed using kintecus the model simulation agrees generally with the experimental data fig 4 indicating that the model is a reasonable approximation to predict the multiple step reactions scheme 1 it is noted that the measured concentrations of p benzoquinone were lower than the model simulation it is likely that the oxidation of phenol or aniline by clo2 may yield some minor unknown products in parallel with p benzoquinone the identification of transformation products from oxidation of ac by clo2 was not successful only acetic acid was identified however based on structural similarity between the two compounds a mechanism for the reaction of clo2 with ac is likewise proposed scheme s1 the oxidative attack mainly led to formation of acetamide and phenol while the formation of acetic acid and aniline was expected to be a minor pathway both phenol and aniline can be oxidized by clo2 to p benzoquinone which can be further oxidized to ring cleavage products gan et al 2020 3 7 implications on water treatment systems for saline water free chlorine pretreatment prior to ro desalination various reactive halogen species can be formed since chloride and bromide can react with free chlorine a kinetic model model s2 was developed to calculate the equilibrium concentrations of various reactive halogens the impact of chloride and bromide on the variation of halogen species concentration with ph in different waters was simulated figure s14 since clo2 was proposed as an alternative disinfectant for controlling biofouling formation in ro desalination the pseudo first order rate constants for the reactions of ba with oxidants in natural waters with various salinities were simulated by multiplying the different oxidants and their species specific rate constants obtained from literature table s2 fig 5 a shows that the pseudo first order rate constant for clo2 was 1 3 orders of magnitude smaller than chlorine under various water treatment conditions depending on the ph the half lives of model monomers e g ba under typical water treatment conditions at an oxidant concentration of 1 mg l can be calculated fig 5b at the ph 8 0 in seawater the half life of model monomers in chlorination was 104 s and that in clo2 treatment has longer half lives e g 107 s however their half lives are ph dependent increasing the ph decreased the half lives of model monomers as a result when clo2 is used as a disinfectant lower ph is desired to avoid the degradation of pa membrane therefore the reactivity of clo2 with membrane model monomers is much lower than those of chlorine and bromine our preliminary results further demonstrate that clo2 shows less oxidant demand than chlorine does in the presence of a commercial pa membrane figure s15 these findings might explain the excellent performance of clo2 exposed membrane in terms of permeate flux and salt rejection when compared to free chlorine in lab scale studies alayemieka and lee 2012 koh and jang 2017 in addition clo2 can inactivate certain chlorine resistant pathogens and does not form significant amounts of toxic halogenated dbps liu et al 2013 vicuna reyes et al 2008 therefore clo2 pretreatment for seawater desalination is expected to be an attractive alternative for controlling biofouling however there are certainly limitations to directly translating the results of model monomer study to that of a three dimensional pa membrane surface in addition hydraulic and operational conditions e g clo2 to amide ratio mass transfer heterogeneous reactions concentration polarization etc in ro systems are different from a batch reactor therefore additional studies will be required in a long term running ro system to assess the performance of clo2 pretreatment 4 conclusions kinetics and mechanisms for reactions of clo2 with pa membrane model monomers e g ba and ac were investigated in this study their reactions with clo2 are base assisted and rate constants were 4 1 0 1 10 1 m 1 24 s 1 and 6 0 0 1 10 3 m 1 s 1 for ba and ac at ph 8 3 and 21 c respectively ba was degraded by clo2 via two pathways 1 the attack on the anilide moiety with the formation of benzamide major pathway and 2 oxidative hydrolysis to benzoic acid minor pathway a kinetic model was developed to simulate the degradation of ba and the formation of transformation products during the clo2 pretreatment process the simulation results agree well with the experimental data indicating that the proposed degradation pathways are valid clo2 is much less reactive with the model monomers than chlorine and bromine therefore pretreatment with clo2 appears to be an attractive alternative for controlling biofouling in seawater desalination assessing the performance of clo2 pretreatment in a pilot scale full scale

14701,aromatic polyamide pa based membranes are widely used for reverse osmosis ro but they can be degraded by free chlorine used for controlling the biofouling prior to ro treatment kinetics and mechanisms for the reactions of pa membrane model monomers i e benzanilide ba and acetanilide ac with chlorine dioxide clo2 were investigated in this study rate constants for the reactions of clo2 with ba and ac at ph 8 3 and 21 c were determined to be 4 1 0 1 10 1 m 1 24 s 1 and 6 0 0 1 10 3 m 1 s 1 respectively these reactions are base assisted with a strong ph dependence the activation energies of ba and ac degradation by clo2 were 123 7 and 81 0 kj mol 1 respectively this indicates a relatively strong temperature dependence in the studied temperature range of 21 35 c the presence of bromide and natural organic matter does not promote the degradation of model monomers by clo2 ba was degraded by clo2 via two pathways 1 the attack on the anilide moiety with the formation of benzamide major pathway and 2 oxidative hydrolysis to benzoic acid minor pathway a kinetic model was developed to simulate the degradation of ba and formation of byproducts during clo2 pretreatment and simulations agree well with the experimental data half lives of ba treated by clo2 were 1 5 orders of magnitude longer than chlorine under typical seawater treatment conditions these novel findings suggest the potential application of clo2 for controlling biofouling ahead of ro treatment at desalination treatments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine dioxide benzanilide acetanilide kinetics degradation pathways polyamide membrane data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the high water permeability high selectivity and wide ph tolerance range of aromatic polyamide pa thin film composite membranes make them an ideal choice for reverse osmosis ro in seawater desalination or water reuse werber et al 2016 the operational stability and economy of ro units are however limited by membrane biofouling misdan et al 2012 currently biofouling is controlled by adding disinfectants such as chlorine in the form of hypochlorous acid hocl while free chlorine is effective in inhibiting microbial growth it can attack the pa active layer as a result changes in membrane permeability reduced permselectivity and membrane failure were observed geise et al 2011 kang et al 2007 kwon et al 2006 in practice most commercial polyamide based membranes have low tolerance limits for free chlorine therefore residual chlorine should be removed before the influent water reaches the ro membrane by applying sodium bisulfite reduction nevertheless biofouling continues to be a problem additionally median bromide concentrations in seawater are c a 67 mg l flury and papritz 1993 chlorine pretreatment during seawater desalination can convert free chlorine to free bromine which can react with natural organic matter nom and thus form highly toxic brominated disinfection byproducts dbps agus and sedlak 2010 kim et al 2015 le roux et al 2015 liu et al 2022 recent studies indicated that the removal efficiencies of some dbps with low molecular weight such as trihalomethanes haloacetonitriles generally were relatively low 50 zeng et al 2016 therefore the formation of dbps during chlorine pretreatment for seawater desalination might pose adverse effects to human health and ecosystems with the objective to control biofouling while reducing the damage of the pa membrane active layer and formation of halogenated dbps chlorine dioxide clo2 has been proposed as an alternative oxidant for the pretreatment of seawater in desalination processes adams 1990 maugin 2013 oh and jang 2016 lab scale studies showed that clo2 exposed membrane exhibited excellent performance in terms of permeate flux and salt rejection alayemieka and lee 2012 koh and jang 2017 clo2 which is a strong oxidant can effectively remove algae inactivate planktonic bacteria and certain chlorine resistant pathogens chauret et al 2001 junli et al 1997 its disinfection efficiency is equal or even superior to chlorine which makes clo2 a suitable alternative gagnon et al 2004 moreover clo2 reacts via electron transfer and thus the formation of halogenated dbps is typically much lower than free chlorine liu et al 2013 in addition the formation of brominated dbps in seawater pretreatment by clo2 is low since the reaction rate constant between clo2 and bromide is small 10 4 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1994 nevertheless clo2 forms inorganic byproducts e g chlorite and chlorate upon its reaction with water constituents with a yield of 50 to 70 for chlorite schmidt et al 2000 considering chlorite being regulated at a maximum contaminant level mcl of 1 mg l by the us environmental protection agency us epa u s environmental protection agency 2006 the dosage of clo2 in water treatment is usually less than 2 mg l acetanilide ac and benzanilide ba are model monomers for the pa membrane it was reported that chlorine can attack ba through n chlorination ring chlorination or orton rearrangement huang et al 2019 soice et al 2003 nevertheless the reactions between these model compounds e g ac and ba and clo2 have not been studied there was still a lack of information about the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of model monomers in addition water matrix nom and bromide and operating parameters ph and temperature may affect the reactions of clo2 with membrane model monomers for example nom is a possible fouling deposit which can lead to high operating pressure and energy consumption the qualitative and quantitative data of model compound degradation and byproduct formation during the clo2 oxidation process will allow assessing the membrane resistance to oxidants with respect to seawater pretreatment the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the kinetics for the reactions of clo2 with model monomers under various water treatment influencing factors 2 identify degradation products and propose reaction mechanisms 3 develop a kinetic model to predict the degradation of model monomers and the formation of transformation byproducts during clo2 pretreatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents all chemical solutions were prepared from reagent grade chemicals or stock solutions using double deionized ddi water 18 2 mω cm 21 c details on commercially available standards and reagents are provided in text s1 of supplementary material stock solutions of ba and ac were prepared at 10 mm in acetonitrile preliminary experiments show that acetonitrile does not react with clo2 suwannee river nom isolate cat no 2r101n was obtained from the international humic substances society we chose to use commercially available nom isolates since they have been widely used as references in literature also their chemical properties are known and interferences from other components of water matrices can be avoided stock solutions of clo2 were prepared with bubbling gaseous clo2 to ddi waters by adding diluted h2so4 slowly to naclo2 solutions liu et al 2013 the saturated naclo2 scrubber removes impurities such as chlorine from the gas stream and the gaseous clo2 in a stable n2 gas stream enters the ddi water it was quantified spectrophotometrically with a molar absorption coefficient of 1230 m 1 cm 1 at 359 nm and stored away from light at 4 c until use furman and margerum 1998 2 2 analytical methods concentrations of residual clo2 was analyzed spectrophotometrically using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method at 515 nm on a uv visible spectrophotometer apha 1998 concentrations of model compounds and their possible transformation byproducts were measured by a thermo vanquish high performance liquid chromatograph hplc equipped with a c18 column 2 1 mm 100 mm 3 μm with a flow rate of 0 2 ml min for ba analysis the mobile phase consisted of 0 1 formic acid in water 50 and methanol 50 while it was 80 water and 20 acetonitrile for the analyses of ac for the quantification of transformation product benzoic acid the mobile phase consisted of 50 water 10 mm phosphoric acid and 50 methanol and the composition for p benzoquinone was 80 water 0 1 formic acid and 20 methanol the wavelengths used for the measurement of ba ac benzoic acid and p benzoquinone on the uv detector were 260 238 227 and 254 nm with retention times of 9 1 2 4 4 8 4 5 min respectively sample injection volumes for ba ac benzoic acid and p benzoquinone were 10 10 50 and 50 µl with quantification limits of 0 05 0 05 0 05 and 0 02 µm respectively 2 3 reaction kinetics of model monomers with clo2 the roles of initial clo2 concentration ph temperature bromide and nom on the reaction kinetics of model monomers and clo2 were investigated the initial clo2 concentration ranged from 50 to 200 μm and the ph values were adjusted to 7 8 8 3 8 6 and 9 0 with 10 mm phosphate ph 7 0 or borate buffer ph 8 0 9 0 no significant change of ph 0 1 was observed during the reaction temperature of reaction solutions ranged from 20 to 35 c initial concentrations of bromide and nom were 0 800 µm and 0 2 mg l respectively all experiments were performed in brown glass vials in the dark reactions were initiated by the addition of clo2 stock solution to the buffered model monomer solutions samples were withdrawn at pre selected time intervals residual clo2 was analyzed by the dpd method for the measurement of model compounds and their transformation products samples were immediately purged with n2 gas to remove the residual clo2 preliminary experiments indicated that n2 blowing did not affect the concentrations of ba or ac figure s1 each experiment was conducted at least in duplicate 2 4 byproduct identification to qualify the transformation products of the reaction of model monomers with clo2 at ph 8 3 10 mm borate buffer and 21 c initial concentrations of clo2 and ba were 200 and 1 μm respectively samples were withdrawn regularly and purged with n2 gas to remove the residual clo2 for the analyses of semi volatile compounds water samples were subjected to a liquid liquid extraction briefly 2 4 ml volume of methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and 10 g of pre dried sodium sulfate were added to 40 ml of samples 40 ml the mtbe extracts were analyzed using an agilent 8890 gas chromatograph gc coupled with an agilent 5977 mass spectrometry ms detector samples 1 µl were injected at 180 c onto an hp 5ms 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 µm column the oven program was held at 80 c for 1 min ramped to 240 c at 10 c min and then hold at 240 c for 4 min additionally water sample acidification and methylation were performed for the identification of transformation products with carboxylic acid groups in brief a 40 ml volume of sample was adjusted to ph 1 using concentrated sulfuric acid and extracted with 3 2 ml of mtbe the mtbe extracts were converted to their methyl esters by the addition of 1 ml of 10 h2so4 methanol solution in a water bath at 50 c for 2 h the extracts are neutralized with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate the mtbe extracts were analyzed by gc ms the oven program was held at 35 c for 6 min and then ramped to 220 c at a rate of 10 c min and then held at 240 c for 0 min the ms detector was operated in the electron ionization mode at 70 ev the quantification of acetic acid formed from the reaction between ac and clo2 was performed using a thermo aquion ion chromatograph ic with an online koh eluent generator the sample was eluted by 5 mm koh through a 25 µl loop injection at a flow rate of 1 ml min through an ionpac as11 column the quantification limit was 0 5 µm 2 5 kinetic modelling model calculations to simulate the degradation of model monomers and formation of transformation byproduct during oxidation processes under various water treatment conditions were performed using the software kintecus ianni 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction order and rate constants of model monomers with clo2 the reactions of model monomers with clo2 under various initial concentrations were investigated at ph 8 3 borate buffer under pseudo first order conditions i e at least a 10 1 molar ratio of clo2 to model compounds in a batch reactor fig 1 and figure s2 in the absence of clo2 concentrations of model monomers remained unchanged in 48 h figure s3 increasing the initial concentrations of clo2 led to an increase in the degradation rate of model monomers the reaction between model compounds and clo2 can be written as follows 1 model compound ncl o 2 prod ucts under the pseudo first order conditions the rate of ba or ac degradation can be simplified to eqs 2 and 3 2 d model compound dt k model compound and 3 in k k n ln cl o 2 o where k represents pseudo first order reaction rate constants and k denotes apparent reaction rate constants a plot of ln k vs ln clo2 0 will yield a straight line accordingly with the slope denoting n i e the stoichiometric number a plot of ln k vs ln clo2 0 for the reactions of ac with clo2 gives a linear curve with the slope i e n almost equaling 1 0 fig 1d thus the reaction between ac and clo2 was of second order in total and first order with respect to each reactant nevertheless a plot of ln k vs ln clo2 0 for the reactions of ba with clo2 gives a slope of 1 24 fig 1c indicating that the reaction order with respect to clo2 was higher than one this may be due to the fact that the decay of clo2 follows mixed order or second order kinetics napolitano et al 2006 stewart et al 2008 based on eq 3 and the intercepts in fig 1c and d the k values for the reactions of clo2 with ba and ac at ph 8 3 and 21 c were calculated to be 4 1 0 1 10 1 m 1 24 s 1 and 6 0 0 1 10 3 m 1 s 1 respectively which are generally lower than those with chlorine 7 6 0 2 101 m 1 s 1 huang et al 2019 based on the small reaction rate constants of clo2 with model monomers for the pa membrane the use of clo2 as a disinfectant in seawater pretreatment could be an attractive alternative 3 2 effect of ph additional experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of ph on the degradation of model monomers over a ph range of 7 0 9 0 fig 2 and figure s4 mimicking possible ph adjustments in the treatment train the k for the reactions of clo2 with both ba and ac increased as ph increased assuming the stoichiometric ratio of clo2 oxidation of ba to be 1 24 clo2 per 1 ba over the ph range of 7 0 9 0 the k values can be calculated according to eq 4 4 k k c l o 2 o 1 24 the obtained k values for the reaction between ba and clo2 increased from 3 4 0 4 10 2 to 3 1 m 1 24 s 1 when ph increased from 7 0 to 9 0 at 21 c table s1 under the same conditions the k for the reaction between ac and clo2 increased from 5 0 0 7 10 4 to 3 9 10 2 m 1 s 1 table s1 a plot of the apparent reaction rate constants versus oh fig 2c and d is characterized by a nearly linear correlation with slopes of 3 1 105 and 3 9 103 for ba and ac respectively amides dissociate and form negatively charged ions with a pka of c a 14 it is likely that clo2 is highly reactive with the deprotonated species abdighahroudi et al 2022 hoigné and bader 1994 regarding seawater pretreatment for ro it can be concluded that a low ph 8 is beneficial to minimize the pa membrane damage by clo2 chlorite which is the major inorganic product from clo2 pretreatment is practically unreactive with model monomers in the studied ph range it was also reported that the presence of chlorite 100 mg l didn t affect the performance of the pa ro membrane ferrero et al 2007 3 3 effect of temperature temperature effects on the reactions of model monomers with clo2 at ph 8 3 were investigated over a range of 21 to 35 c fig 3 and figure s5 in the absence of clo2 concentrations of model monomers under various temperatures remained unchanged in 48 h figure s3 the degradation rates of both ba and ac increased with increases in temperature higher temperatures facilitate the degradation of ba and ac by clo2 when the temperature increased from 21 c to 35 c k for the reaction of clo2 with ba increased from 9 7 10 6 to 7 2 10 5 s 1 while k for the reaction of clo2 with ac increased from 1 4 10 6 to 5 0 10 6 s 1 a linearized arrhenius equation eq 5 has been used to calculate the activation energy by means of the reaction rate constants at different temperatures 5 i n k i n a e a r t where ea activation energy r molar gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and t degree k and a preexponential factor plotting ln k vs 1 t would yield a linear curve and the slope gives ea r fig 3c and d the ea values for the reactions of clo2 with ba and ac at ph 8 3 are calculated to be 123 7 and 81 0 kj mol 1 respectively according to these values a 5 c temperature increase results in increases of reaction rate constant for ba and ac by a factor of around 2 3 and 1 7 respectively 3 4 effect of nom and bromide the effect of different concentrations of nom on the degradation of model monomers was investigated figure s6 increasing the concentrations of nom increased the decay of clo2 since nom can compete with ba or ac for clo2 liu et al 2013 as a result lower oxidant exposure in the presence of nom led to lower degradation rates of ba or ac recent studies showed that the reaction of clo2 with nom can lead to the in situ formation of free chlorine with a yield up to 27 rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 since free chlorine reacts faster with ba than clo2 does the potential enhancement of secondarily formed chlorine is of interest additional experiments clo2 0 13 8 μm ba 0 50 μm ph 8 3 indicate that the presence of 2 mg l nom isolate does not enhance the degradation of ba figure s7 no chlorinated products were identified by gc ms figure s8 implying an insignificant role of free chlorine in this study this is likely due to the rapid consumption of free chlorine by nom zhu and zhang 2016 figure s9 presents the effect of initial bromide concentrations on the reactions between model monomers and clo2 the decay of clo2 and degradation of model monomers under various concentrations of bromide are almost identical this can be explained by the fact that clo2 does not react with bromide to form free bromine 10 4 m 1 s 1 hoigné and bader 1994 given that free bromine has a higher reaction rate constant with ba than chlorine does huang et al 2021 our findings indicate that unlike chlorination the presence of high concentrations of bromide may not enhance the degradation of pa membrane in clo2 pretreatment 3 5 byproduct identification further efforts have been made to identify the transformation byproducts during clo2 treatment of pa membrane model monomers figure s10 shows the typical gc ms chromatograms of the water samples containing ba treated by clo2 based on the chromatograms compound b1 with retention time rt of 8 62 min and molecular weight mw of 121 was identified to be benzamide figure s11 to further identify the potential products with carboxylic groups oxidized ba samples were acidified and methylated compound b2 with a molecular ion of m z 136 is the methylated product of benzoic acid figure s11 these products were further confirmed by the injections of individual standards in addition the formation of p benzoquinone was confirmed by hplc results shown later fig 4 shows the evolution of the concentrations of benzanilide and its transformation products during clo2 oxidation in ddi water results indicated that benzamide and p benzoquinone were the major products while the formation of benzoic acid was minor during the reaction course the degradation of ba led to the formation of benzamide and benzoic acid which accounted for approximately 80 and 10 with respect to the mass balance respectively the two products accumulated with time while for p benzoquinone after the maximum formation was reached at about 30 h the p benzoquinone concentration decreased as a function of the reaction time these findings agree with the undermentioned result that p benzoquinone can further react with clo2 previous studies showed halogenated benzanilide e g n chloro n phenylbenzamide n 4 chlorophenyl benzamide n 4 bromophenyl benzamide etc as the primary products during chlorination bromination of benzanilide huang et al 2019 huang et al 2021 however nonhalogenated intermediates such as benzamide benzoic acid and p benzoquinone were first identified as byproducts and quantified during the oxidation of benzanilide in this study this implies that benzanilide reacts with clo2 via a distinct pathway as compared to chlorine a mass balance ranging from 90 to 110 which was calculated from the mean concentrations of benzanilide benzamide and benzoic acid at various reaction times infers that the major byproducts have been accounted for in this work additional experiments were performed to investigate the reaction rate constants of ba transformation products with clo2 figure s12 results indicate that benzamide and benzoic acid do not react with clo2 under the experimental conditions in this study nevertheless p benzoquinone can undergo hydrolysis with a rate constant of 1 4 10 6 s 1 figure s12 the second order reaction rate constant between p benzoquinone and clo2 was determined to be 1 0 10 2 m 1 s 1 which was higher than that reported by a previous study 5 10 3 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 tratnyek and hoigné 1994 attempts were also made to identify the potential products formed during oxidation of ac by clo2 yet only a few products were identified the formation of p benzoquinone was below the limit of quantification of 0 2 µm figure s13 shows that the concentration of acetic acid increased as a function of reaction time a yield of 15 for acetic acid was observed and thus the formation of acetic acid was a minor pathway this is similar to the case for ba where benzoic acid formation is minor 3 6 proposed reaction mechanisms based on the identified transformation products and their reaction rate constants with clo2 a mechanism for the reaction of clo2 with ba is proposed scheme 1 the degradation of benzanilide was mainly initiated by the attack of clo2 on the anilide moiety 80 the oxidative attack led to the cleavage of c n bond and the subsequent formation of benzamide and phenol the latter form could be proposed as an intermediate however owing to the high apparent reaction rate constant between phenol and clo2 0 5 106 m 1s 1 at ph 8 0 hoigné and bader 1994 the half live of phenol was 7 10 3 s in this study and thus the steady state concentration of phenol was too low to be detected the subsequent oxidation of phenol yields p benzoquinone which can be further oxidized to ring cleavage products gan et al 2020 additionally the oxidative hydrolysis of ba in the presence of clo2 led to the formation of benzoic acid and aniline which is a minor pathway 10 the formation of p benzoquinone was a major product from aniline oxidation by clo2 via several intermediates e g iminoquinone aguilar et al 2014 likewise aniline was not detected because of its high apparent reaction rate of with clo2 4 5 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 9 huie and neta 1986 to better understand the multiple step reactions of benzanilide with clo2 a kinetic model was developed to fit the experimental data obtained at various reaction times this kinetic model is given in model s1 and model calculations were performed using kintecus the model simulation agrees generally with the experimental data fig 4 indicating that the model is a reasonable approximation to predict the multiple step reactions scheme 1 it is noted that the measured concentrations of p benzoquinone were lower than the model simulation it is likely that the oxidation of phenol or aniline by clo2 may yield some minor unknown products in parallel with p benzoquinone the identification of transformation products from oxidation of ac by clo2 was not successful only acetic acid was identified however based on structural similarity between the two compounds a mechanism for the reaction of clo2 with ac is likewise proposed scheme s1 the oxidative attack mainly led to formation of acetamide and phenol while the formation of acetic acid and aniline was expected to be a minor pathway both phenol and aniline can be oxidized by clo2 to p benzoquinone which can be further oxidized to ring cleavage products gan et al 2020 3 7 implications on water treatment systems for saline water free chlorine pretreatment prior to ro desalination various reactive halogen species can be formed since chloride and bromide can react with free chlorine a kinetic model model s2 was developed to calculate the equilibrium concentrations of various reactive halogens the impact of chloride and bromide on the variation of halogen species concentration with ph in different waters was simulated figure s14 since clo2 was proposed as an alternative disinfectant for controlling biofouling formation in ro desalination the pseudo first order rate constants for the reactions of ba with oxidants in natural waters with various salinities were simulated by multiplying the different oxidants and their species specific rate constants obtained from literature table s2 fig 5 a shows that the pseudo first order rate constant for clo2 was 1 3 orders of magnitude smaller than chlorine under various water treatment conditions depending on the ph the half lives of model monomers e g ba under typical water treatment conditions at an oxidant concentration of 1 mg l can be calculated fig 5b at the ph 8 0 in seawater the half life of model monomers in chlorination was 104 s and that in clo2 treatment has longer half lives e g 107 s however their half lives are ph dependent increasing the ph decreased the half lives of model monomers as a result when clo2 is used as a disinfectant lower ph is desired to avoid the degradation of pa membrane therefore the reactivity of clo2 with membrane model monomers is much lower than those of chlorine and bromine our preliminary results further demonstrate that clo2 shows less oxidant demand than chlorine does in the presence of a commercial pa membrane figure s15 these findings might explain the excellent performance of clo2 exposed membrane in terms of permeate flux and salt rejection when compared to free chlorine in lab scale studies alayemieka and lee 2012 koh and jang 2017 in addition clo2 can inactivate certain chlorine resistant pathogens and does not form significant amounts of toxic halogenated dbps liu et al 2013 vicuna reyes et al 2008 therefore clo2 pretreatment for seawater desalination is expected to be an attractive alternative for controlling biofouling however there are certainly limitations to directly translating the results of model monomer study to that of a three dimensional pa membrane surface in addition hydraulic and operational conditions e g clo2 to amide ratio mass transfer heterogeneous reactions concentration polarization etc in ro systems are different from a batch reactor therefore additional studies will be required in a long term running ro system to assess the performance of clo2 pretreatment 4 conclusions kinetics and mechanisms for reactions of clo2 with pa membrane model monomers e g ba and ac were investigated in this study their reactions with clo2 are base assisted and rate constants were 4 1 0 1 10 1 m 1 24 s 1 and 6 0 0 1 10 3 m 1 s 1 for ba and ac at ph 8 3 and 21 c respectively ba was degraded by clo2 via two pathways 1 the attack on the anilide moiety with the formation of benzamide major pathway and 2 oxidative hydrolysis to benzoic acid minor pathway a kinetic model was developed to simulate the degradation of ba and the formation of transformation products during the clo2 pretreatment process the simulation results agree well with the experimental data indicating that the proposed degradation pathways are valid clo2 is much less reactive with the model monomers than chlorine and bromine therefore pretreatment with clo2 appears to be an attractive alternative for controlling biofouling in seawater desalination assessing the performance of clo2 pretreatment in a pilot scale full scale

14702,hydraulic fracturing flowback and produced water hf fpw from shale gas extraction processes is a highly complex medium with potential threats to the environment current research on ecological risks of fpw in china is limited and the link between major components of fpw and their toxicological effects on freshwater organisms is largely unknown by integrating chemical and biological analyses toxicity identification evaluation tie was used to reveal causality between toxicity and contaminants potentially disentangling the complex toxicological nature of fpw here fpw from different shale gas wells treated fpw effluent and a leachate from hf sludge were collected from southwest china and tie was applied to obtain a comprehensive toxicity evaluation in freshwater organisms our results showed that fpw from the same geographic zone could cause significantly different toxicity salinity solid phase particulates and organic contaminants were identified as the main contributors to the toxicity of fpw in addition to water chemistry internal alkanes pahs and hf additives e g biocides and surfactants were quantified in exposed embryonic fish by target and non target tissue analyses the treated fpw failed to mitigate the toxicity associated with organic contaminants transcriptomic results illustrated that organic compounds induced toxicity pathways in fpw exposed embryonic zebrafish similar zebrafish gene ontologies were affected between treated and untreated fpw again confirming that sewage treatment did not effectively remove organic chemicals from fpw thus zebrafish transcriptome analyses revealed organic toxicant induced adverse outcome pathways and served as evidence for tie confirmation in complex mixtures under data poor scenarios graphical abstract image

available on request 1 introduction shale gas is an unconventional gas that has the potential to supply an ever growing energy demand stabilize soaring gas prices for global economic security and adequately transform global energy markets for the next few decades wang and li 2019 yang and thompson 2014 with the maturity of hydraulic fracturing hf techniques the current technically recoverable shale gas reserves in china are ranked at the top of the world eia 2015 gao et al 2021 however hf demands large amounts of water carrero parreño et al 2017 and potentially causes environmental challenges kerr 2010 lutz et al 2013 thereby inhibiting the sustainable progress of unconventional resources in china li et al 2022 one challenge is the ecological risk associated with the generation of large volumes of flowback and produced water fpw complex wastewater that returns to the surface after hf activity zhong et al 2021 the fpw is a tripartite mixture of injected drilling fluid components deep formation water and secondary byproducts of downhole reactions with the formation environment drollette et al 2015 llewellyn et al 2015 previous investigations have reported that fpw contains high levels of inorganic salts metals organics total dissolved solids tds folkerts et al 2020 stringfellow et al 2014 dissolved organic matter dom butkovskyi et al 2017 and naturally occurring radioactive materials zhou et al 2022a and these substances could elicit ecological risks when not properly managed before disposal or reuse although ecotoxicological research on fpw in china is scarce many studies in north america have examined fpw toxicity to freshwater and marine organisms and concluded that high salinity is a main driving factor blewett et al 2017 folkerts et al 2019 various organic components in fpw such as biocides surfactants endocrine disrupting chemicals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are also harmful to freshwater organisms blewett et al 2017 elliott et al 2017 he et al 2017b additionally metals and metal organic complexes in fpw are capable of enhancing the toxicity of organic contaminants folkerts et al 2019 mehler et al 2021 fpw samples from the marcellus shale play in the u s have been shown to contain high levels of barium bromide 228ra strontium and other salts kuwayama et al 2013 high levels of radioactive chemicals 238u and 226ra have also been detected in wastewater sludges from the sichuan basin shale in china which may cause environmental risk zhou et al 2022a these studies suggest that the aquatic toxicity of fpw is noteworthy and complicated however causality investigations between various contaminants and ecotoxicological effects on freshwater organisms are limited making it difficult to identify and prioritize major toxic components the composition of fpw is highly variable and region specific due to the heterogeneity of geologic formations and different chemical contributions of returning fpw stringfellow et al 2014 changes in geographic locations and chemical compositions of fracturing fluid can result in varying ecological risks of fpw for example he et al 2018 detected distinct organic compositions of two fpw samples from the same geological region and these samples exhibited different developmental toxicity to zebrafish embryos furthermore mixtures of oil and water based fluids are typically applied during hydraulic fracturing in china leading to the return of various types of fpw to the surface and eliciting different adverse outcomes which require urgent investigation toxicity identification evaluation tie has been developed to identify the main toxicants in complex mixtures since the 1990s epa 1991 by integrating chemical and biological analyses tie techniques have been shown to be promising approaches for understanding the causality between toxicity and contaminants recent development in transcriptomic analysis suggests that gene information is closely related to toxicant induced adverse outcome pathways demonstrating that transcriptomics can serve as an additional line of evidence for tie confirmation antczak et al 2013 in the present study aquatic toxicities of four fpw samples from different shale gas wells fpw effluent from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and leachate from flowback sludges collected from sichuan china were examined using multiple ecologically relevant vertebrates including a native fish species and an invertebrate species potential toxicants were characterized using a tie approach supported by target and non target analyses of internal organic chemical residues toxicogenomics of d rerio after exposure to fpw was assessed to provide effect driven evidence for tie confirmation as well as to demonstrate the treatment efficiency of wwtp the present study aims to reveal the risk of shale gas development in local freshwater ecosystems prioritize the main components that trigger aquatic toxicity and support future sustainable shale gas production in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample description sichuan basin is the major shale gas exploration area in china accounting for more than 90 of shale gas reserves in china 2021 five fpw and one sludge samples were collected from the changning state level operation zone in sichuan basin shale this site has been constructed by the petrochina southwest oil gasfield company since march 2012 fpw 1 and fpw 2 were post simulation water collected at 413 and 347 d respectively after initial fracturing from two oil based hf wells no additional fracturing was performed afterwards so both samples should reflect long term residuals and other components produced from the shale formation fpw 3 was collected from a central collection site containing mixed fpw before wastewater treatment facilities while fpw 4 was collected from an open pooled water storage with an average retention time of 10 d before the fpw flows to the central collection system a treated fpw effluent t fpw was also sampled from a centralized shale gas wwtp which collected 400 800 m3 of wastewater mainly fpw daily from 75 wells at different flowback stages from several weeks to three years zhou et al 2022a in addition to fpw samples a leachate sample from flowback sludge was collected flowback sludge is a mixture of oil based drilling cuttings and drilling mud collected during the hydraulic drilling and fracturing stage the sludge was washed with clean water and went through solid liquid separation the solid phase is compressed as mud cakes and used as raw materials for unfired bricks and the leachate requires further treatment before entering the environment all samples were collected in brown glass bottles the samples were filled to eliminate air space and stored at 4 c to avoid possible degradation before chemical and toxicological analyses acute toxicity tests were completed within two weeks of sample collection 2 2 water chemistry parameters and inorganics in fpw samples water chemistry parameters were analyzed for the fpw and leachate samples including dissolved organic carbon doc contents total dissolved solids conductivity salinity ph hardness and alkalinity table s1 in addition five anions in water samples were quantified with a dionex dx 600 ion chromatography installed with an as9 hc analytical column an ag9 hc guard column and an asrs ultra suppressor 4 mm metals metalloids and total sulfur and phosphorus in water samples were measured with agilent 5110 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes and agilent 7900 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms in addition particulates in selected fpw samples fpw 1 and fpw 2 were collected by filtering through a glass fiber filter membrane gff whatman maidstone uk 90 mm diameter 0 7 μm pore size sediments were rinsed with ultrapure water to remove residual brine and prevent salt precipitation samples were then covered air dried and then mounted on aluminum sem tabs ted pella inc redding ca usa the morphology of solids in fpw 1 and fpw 2 were performed by a thermo helios 5 cx scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analysis using an oxford ultim max 65 detector 2 3 organic compounds in fpw samples to analyze organic constituents in fpw the samples were separated to aqueous w and solid particle s phases by filtering 100 ml of each sample through a gff membrane aqueous filtrate samples were extracted by liquid liquid extraction using dichloromethane and cleaned with florisil solid phase extraction spe cartridges collected particles were freeze dried extracted with a thermo fisher ase 350 accelerated solvent extractor using a mixture solution of hexane dichloromethane and acetone mixture 2 2 1 v v v and purified using a silica alumina column for target analyses 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and 24 n alkanes c10 c33 were analyzed using a shimadzu tq 8040 gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry gc ms ms in selective ion mode with electron impact ionization furthermore 942 suspect chemicals were identified and semi quantified by gc ms ms in full scan mode using the compound composer software detailed procedures for analyzing organic constituents from the water w and particle s phases are summarized in the supporting information si 2 4 testing organisms the freshwater invertebrate daphnia magna and embryonic vertebrates danio rerio and gobiocypris rarus were selected as model organisms to assess the toxicity of fpw d magna is sensitive to various contaminants and have been utilized as an indicator species for assessing freshwater quality zebrafish d rerio and chinese rare minnows g rarus are ideal vertebrate models because of their high sensitivity to anthropogenic contaminants during development transparency for visual observations and well studied sublethal endpoints although d rerio has been accepted worldwide for chemical hazard assessment g rarus is a native species that originated in sichuan china and has been recently required as a native alternative animal model for chemical toxicity evaluation in china bai et al 2021 both fish embryos were collected from group spawns and staged to ensure all embryos were 6 8 h post fertilization hpf and d magna neonates 24 h were pre acclimated for acute toxicity tests detailed procedures for organism culture and fish embryo collection are provided in the si 2 5 toxicity identification evaluation tie 2 5 1 tie screening toxicity tests to characterize fpw toxicity and identify the main drivers a tie method was applied including toxicity screening characterization identification and confirmation fig 1 first the toxicity of five fpw samples and sludge leachate was examined using the three species according to the oecd test guidelines with minor modifications oecd 2004 2013 a series of range finding tests were performed for all species prior to acute lethal toxicity analyses to ensure that proper dilutions of fpw were used to accurately acquire median lethal concentration lc50 values of each fpw sample the final fpw dilution fractions used for individual treatment levels during the screening tests are summarized in table s2 for d magna fpw and leachate were diluted with aerated tap water to various concentrations at a fixed volume of 20 ml adult d magna 10 per replicate was transferred to each beaker to initiate 48 h exposure each treatment level was carried out with six replicates at 22 0 5 c with a 16 8 h light dark photoperiod under full spectrum fluorescent grow lights in addition to these directly diluted fpw samples the toxicity of fpw 2 to d magna was also examined after filtration through 0 22 μm nylon membranes before fish embryo toxicity tests fet embryo viability was examined under a stereomicroscope szx 7 olympus tokyo japan following a method described by kimmel et al 1995 embryos were staged to ensure 6 hpf at the beginning of the experiment fish embryos were introduced into each well in 96 well plates and exposed to a gradient of fpw dilutions the d rerio exposure media was diluted in the fpw samples with embryo culture media at various concentrations and the g rarus exposure media was diluted in aerated tap water at concentrations ranging from 2 5 to 50 table s2 embryo mortality and malformations were examined daily until 120 hpf to examine developmental toxicity by fpw each treatment contained three replicates with 12 embryos per replicate the embryos were exposed at 28 0 5 c with a 14 10 light dark photoperiod due to the high complexity of fpw samples and the relatively short duration of the test exposure media were not renewed throughout the acute toxicity tests and the plates were covered with parafilm to minimize water evaporation at the end of the 120 h exposure survived d rerio and g rarus were rinsed with mill q water dried with tissues and weighed and chemical residues in the organisms were analyzed in addition dose response relationships of individual organisms to salinity were evaluated using nacl solutions tissue sample preparation and instrumental analysis procedures are detailed in the si 2 5 2 tie toxicity characterization as fpw 1 and fpw 2 were direct post simulation water directly collected from different sampling wells without storage tie characterization was further conducted for these two samples using zebrafish embryos as test species following the usepa procedure with minor modifications fig 1 norberg king et al 1991 in brief fpw 1 and fpw 2 were diluted with embryo culture media to 30 and 20 of the original settings respectively each fpw sample was filtered through 0 7 μm gff membrane to remove particles samples were then passed through c18 spe cartridges for retaining organic compounds and the eluate was collected in parallel ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 12 mg l and sodium thiosulphate sts 50 mg l were added individually to the filtered fpw to determine the presence of cationic metals and oxidative agents respectively hockett and mount 1996 the toxicity of the samples after tie manipulations was assessed and compared with the original and filtered fpw additionally 5 ml of methanol and 5 ml of a mixture of dichloromethane and hexane 1 1 v v were used to elute moderately polar and non polar compounds respectively from spe cartridges that enriched organic contaminants in fpw after solvent exchanged to 2 dimethyl sulfoxide dmso the two eluates were also used for toxicity evaluation the toxicity of solvent controls 2 dmso and 2 methanol was assessed with fish embryo testing concurrently each exposure and the corresponding control contain 12 embryos and all treatments were examined in triplicate 2 5 3 tie toxicity identification by target and non target tissue analyses as organics were found to contribute to fpw toxicity during tie characterization chemical analysis was performed for target and non target contaminants in survived fish after exposure to fpw samples at their respective lc50 in addition to analyzing contaminants in water samples considering small size of tissue samples and instrumental sensitivity exposed organisms from the same treatment level were pooled together for chemical analyses n 1 since the organic composition of fpw is complex and the lack of reference standards makes quantification difficult non target contaminants were only screened in exposed fish to show potential internalized surfactant related organic chemicals using agilent 1290 6545 huplc q tof ms details on tissue sample preparation and instrumental analysis are provided in the si and table s3 2 5 4 tie toxicity confirmation by transcriptome sequencing fpw 1 was selected as the representative fpw sample for transcriptome sequencing in exposed embryonic zebrafish meanwhile t fpw was chosen to reveal the efficacy of wwtp in toxicity remediation while the leachate represented a different sample related to shale gas by products for data analysis read counts were normalized based on desseq2 with fdr and log2fc values being calculated love et al 2014 significantly different genes were discriminated based on fdr 0 05 and log2fc 1 and a list of differentially expressed genes degs in the fish samples was obtained owens et al 2019 significant degs observed in the comparative toxicogenomics database ctd were collected to illustrate genes that could be affected by chemical toxicants in fpw davis et al 2021 both sets of genes were compared to identify matched genes and then gene ontology go gene ontology consortium 2004 and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg kanehisa and goto 2000 enrichment analyses were performed to obtain ontology and pathway information respectively subramanian et al 2005 finally phenotypic features from ctd and pubmed databases were fused to obtain phenotypic features associated with these ontologies and pathways for tie confirmation 2 6 quality assurance and quality control to ensure analytical quality instrumental performance was verified by analyzing a calibration standard every 10 samples for gc ms ms variations among calibration standard checks were within 20 solvent blanks matrix blanks and matrix spikes and duplicates were assessed simultaneously with the samples recoveries in the range of 50 150 with relative standard deviations less than 20 were considered acceptable for most compounds except for the volatile di and tri cyclic pahs whose recovery of 30 was also acceptable recoveries of surrogates and pahs in matrix spikes are shown in fig s1 to ensure the reliability of the suspect screening results solvent and matrix blanks were analyzed along with the samples no compound was detected in the blanks thermal degradation of p p ddt was checked every 10 samples and a decomposition less than 15 was considered acceptable in addition a mixture standard containing 16 pahs 19 organochlorine pesticides ocps and six pyrethroids 200 μg l of each compound was analyzed to ensure the reliability of the compound composer method all test compounds were all accurately identified and semi quantitative results ranged from 115 to 454 μg l with relative errors of 101 47 4 2 7 statistics organism mortality under various exposure concentrations was fitted to a four parameter logistic model to calculate the corresponding lc50 values in sigmaplot v14 0 normality was evaluated using the kolmogorov smirnov one sample test and homogeneity of variance was determined by the levene s test a logarithmic transformation was performed if necessary to meet the assumptions statistical differences in lc50 values of the same organism among various sample treatments were analyzed using the litchfield wilcoxon method when treatments share similar exposure concentration gradients for those treatments with various diluted fractions as exposure gradients the lc50 values that had no overlapping 95 cis were considered significantly different folkerts et al 2019 one way analysis of variance anova followed by holm sidak post hoc test was employed to evaluate statistical differences in d rerio mortality among tie treatments statistical differences at a p value 0 05 were considered significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 major contaminants identified in fpw and leachate samples inorganic analyses revealed high concentrations of na cl ca k and mg in all water samples tables s4 s6 leachate had the highest ion concentrations followed by fpw 1 and fpw 2 which were freshly collected on site a similar trend was observed in tds readings with the highest value in the leachate 52 1 g l although the leachate had the highest value doc contents varied across fpw samples fpw 3 and t fpw had similar doc contents and fpw 3 was from the centralized produced water collection system before wwtp implying that wastewater treatment may not be effective for removing organic contaminants table s1 furthermore high levels of sr were found in all samples ba and li were detectable in all fpw samples except for the leachate outside these constituents br was also found at high concentrations up to 67 mg l in leachate and fpw samples table s4 previous investigations reported that the tds of fpw collected in the sichuan basin ranged from 13 7 to 38 9 g l huang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 which was generally lower than that previously documented in the u s 183 243 g l he et al 2018 in our collected samples leachate had comparable tds values 52 1 g l with previous studies in the same shale formation while the tds in other fpw samples was lower 1 27 2 17 g l likely due to the long post simulation time since the initial fracturing organic contaminants were quantified in aqueous and particle phases of fpw samples and the distribution of pahs between the two phases is shown in fig 2 a organic profiles revealed that fpw 2 had substantially higher concentrations of pahs than the remaining samples and three and four ring compounds were the dominant pahs phenanthrene was often found at high levels in all samples with total concentrations aqueous and particle phases ranging from 400 to 1137 ng l table s7 additionally pyrene was detected at high concentrations in fpw 2 particles and dominated pah compositions in both phases of fpw 4 most samples had higher pah content in particle phase fpw 1 34 66 fpw 2 21 79 fpw 3 14 86 t fpw 31 69 while the phase distribution of pahs was uniform in fpw 4 53 47 and leachate 47 53 more alkanes c10 c33 were found in the particles than in the aqueous phase and alkanes with short carbon chains c10 c24 dominated the distribution in both phases fig 2b and table s8 previous studies suggest that short chain alkanes tend to be exacerbated by anthropogenic stressors zhang et al 2019 beyond these target pahs and alkanes suspect analysis semi quantified 10 additional categories of organic compounds e g ethers fatty acids pesticides and biocides in fpw samples fig 2c 2d and table s9 taken together fpw 2 contained the highest levels of organic compounds the results of water chemistry demonstrate that fpw compositions varied likely depends on well locations and the time of flowback collection 3 2 toxicity of fpw to different organisms the acute toxicity of fpw samples to freshwater organisms was examined as percentages of dilution during tie screening toxicity tests fig 3 and table s10 and their dose response curves are presented in fig s2 the toxicity of fpw 1 and fpw 2 was not significantly different for both fish embryos but fpw 2 was surprisingly highly toxic to d magna fpw 3 was less toxic to d rerio than other fpw samples the toxicity of fpw 4 to d magna was comparable to other fpw samples whereas it was more toxic to zebrafish embryos but much less toxic to embryonic g rarus than other samples treated fpw significantly reduced mortality to d rerio and d magna but unexpectedly it provoked higher mortality to g rarus than untreated fpw samples comparatively fpw sludge leachate had the highest toxicity among all samples to all species except that it showed less toxicity to d magna than fpw 2 testing organisms showed varying susceptibility to fpw samples while d rerio embryos had higher susceptibility than g rarus to some fpw samples fpw 2 and fpw 4 g rarus were more sensitive to the treated fpw than other species and samples fig 3 as detailed in the daily monitored mortality fig s4 t fpw exposed to g rarus showed relatively low mortality during the first 96 h but the mortality dramatically increased in the last 24 h of the exposure period zhou et al 2022b demonstrated that g rarus are more susceptible to metals and some neurotoxicants than d rerio and the two species had distinct embryo chorion pore size and thickness as shown in table s1 t fpw contained the lowest salinity and particulate concentration among all samples and the levels of majority of metals in t fpw were lower than those in other fpw samples tables s5 and s6 as such metals might not be the reason for the elevated toxicity of t fpw to g rarus in comparison with other fpw samples on the other hand doc content in t fpw was much higher than that in other fpw samples a previous study showed that some conventional wwtp performed poorly in the removal of organic contaminants liu et al 2022 the removal efficiencies are related to chemical hydrophobicity with a relatively higher removal efficiency for hydrophobic but less effective for hydrophilic and low to moderate hydrophobic contaminants meanwhile biological treatment systems in wwtp might reflux activated sludge during anaerobic and anoxic stages and the process could result in organic pollution amplification česonienė et al 2019 some of the main contaminants that were more sensitive to g rarus likely remained in water after wastewater treatment jiang et al 2015 found that g rarus was more sensitive to fenvalerate than embryonic zebrafish and at other life stages meanwhile a study analyzed the difference in sensitivity between g rarus and d rerio embryos they found that the 96 h lc50s of zinc sulfate potassium dichromate and 2 3h benzothiazolone were significantly lower in g rarus than that in d rerio embryo suggesting g rarus maybe more susceptible to certain chemicals wang et al 2021 both fpw 3 and t fpw had relatively higher doc than other fpw samples which corresponded to their relatively higher toxicity to g rarus than to d rerio however current chemical analysis was not able to distinguish major contaminants in the treated fpw that triggered a high toxicity to g rarus specifically it is worth pursuing in the future through non target screening to identify and verify main toxicants causing the toxicity in t fpw to g rarus unlike fish embryos fpw 2 provoked the highest mortality in the crustaceans fig 3c organic chemicals detected in fpw 2 were much higher than those detected in fpw 1 especially in the particle phase fig 2 to distinguish toxicity contribution from particulates suspended particles in fpw were removed by filtering through 0 22 µm membranes the toxicity of filtered fpw 1 and 2 to d magna was substantially mitigated and lc50 increased from 14 to 27 for fpw 1 and from 0 7 to 25 for fpw 2 by filtration fig 3c and s5 comparable lc50s between the filtered samples suggest that a significant toxicity difference in d magna between fpw 1 and 2 largely originated from the particulates diverse organic contaminants including pahs alkyl pahs and organophosphate esters were previously detected in the fpw particulates he et al 2018 as a filter feeder it is possible that d magna ingested suspended particulates during feeding and their constant movement gathered particles in their antennas and thoracopods wu et al 2017 resulting in chemical accumulation and high toxicity furthermore doc normalization reduced the toxicity difference between the two fpw samples although fpw 2 was still approximately two times more toxic to d magna lc50s of 7 6 and 3 4 mg doc l for fpw 1 and 2 respectively fig s5 the immobility of d manga was previously reported as a sensitive endpoint related to the high organic content in fpw blewett et al 2018 excessive waterborne surfactants can decrease surface tension and floating hydrocarbons adhere to d magna breaking through the water surface and preventing submergence this physical damage associated with organic surfactants may be partially attributed to the mortality of d magna collectively freshwater organisms are susceptible to fpw exposures but adverse outcomes are species and fpw type dependent in general fet tests showed protective effects for native species while d magna was particularly sensitive to solid particles in addition fpw from different sampling wells had distinct toxicity to organisms which was also observed in previous investigations of other shale gas formations golding et al 2022 thus site specific risk assessments are necessary for fpw management 3 3 tie characterization of fpw to d rerio the toxicity tests for aquatic species verified the presence of fpw toxicity and further tie manipulations were performed the toxicants can be tentatively characterized as substances whose toxicity is ph sensitive non polar organics oxidants cationic metals and others liu et al 2022 fpw 1 and fpw 2 were selected to further investigate the toxicity contribution of various components d rerio was selected as the test organism for the tie experiment due to its relatively high sensitivity and rapid development for toxicity screening the toxicity of the original fpw 1 and fpw 2 samples and the tie manipulated samples to zebrafish embryos is shown in fig 4 original fpw 1 and fpw 2 samples were diluted to 30 and 20 respectively for tie experiments to ensure a toxicity reduction was detectable since sodium and chloride were the dominant cation and anion in fpw 1 and fpw 2 both exceeded 6800 mg l of na and 12 000 mg l of cl nacl was used to examine the potential toxicity contribution from salinity after 30 and 20 dilution sodium concentrations were 2040 and 1380 mg l in fpw 1 and fpw 2 respectively the corresponding mortality in d rerio caused by the similar concentrations of nacl could reach 81 7 ci 73 4 90 1 for fpw 1 and 56 4 ci 48 6 64 1 for fpw 2 fig s6 and s7 this implied that salinity especially nacl was likely a major contributor to fpw samples interestingly after individual tie manipulations the toxicity of fpw 1 and fpw 2 behaved distinctly toward d rerio although there is no significant reduction in d rerio mortality after the removal of particulates by filtration for fpw 1 the toxicity decreased considerably further passing through a c18 spe cartridge fig 4a this indicated that waterborne organic contaminants contributed substantially to fpw 1 toxicity and were removed by spe absorbents the sorbed chemicals were then eluted out of the cartridge using methanol and a mixture of hexane and dichloromethane solvent exchanged to dmso sequentially the mortality of the eluates was not significantly different from that of solvent controls fig 4b the saline control was not significantly different from the sample treated with spe suggesting that residual toxicity after spe treatment was mainly from the salinity adding edta or sts changed the mortality little however it could not conclude that there were no toxic metals and oxidants as their toxicity contributions may be masked by high salinity fpw 2 toxicity was reduced by approximately 40 after filtration implying that solid particles contributed considerable toxicity to d rerio fig 4c it may be related to the high level of contaminants in the particulates of this sample fig 2 although the c18 spe did not further reduce embryonic mortality the eluate from the spe cartridge elicited significantly higher mortality to d rerio compared with solvent controls particularly the methanol eluate fig 4d this implies that hydrophilic compounds substantially contributed to the observed toxicity while hydrophobic compounds were possible toxicity drivers residual water after spe was still highly toxic to d rerio but it was not significantly different from the saline control our result showed that the salinity still contributed a great amount of toxicity approximately 60 in fpw 2 filtered particulates and organics may be responsible for the remaining embryo mortality like fpw 1 edta and sts additions did not alter the toxicity of the filtered fpw 2 sample together tie manipulations concluded that salinity particulates and organics were major contributors to fpw toxicity particulates also attributed partial toxicity and led to embryo mortality previous studies have also concluded that particle rich fpw possessed greater toxicity than the filtered particle free samples he et al 2017b during fracturing and production fluids in contact with shales can react chemically with mineral assemblages within the rock by leaching sorbed species from mineral surfaces or dissolving the mineral phase li et al 2017 warner et al 2014 through sem we identified many amorphous and porous particulates that were likely aggregated by many small sphere solids and fragments to form various sized particles fig s8 eds was performed on several spots of individual particulate to measure their approximate elemental compositions the main composition of particulates in fpw 1 was composed of silica 48 4 7 oxygen 22 2 9 carbon 12 0 9 iron 8 2 1 and platinum 6 2 1 by weight similarly main compositions were silica 41 4 3 oxygen 24 3 0 carbon 18 0 9 iron 10 1 6 and platinum 5 0 9 in fpw 2 particulates these elements accounted for over 96 and 98 by weight of inorganic compositions in fpw 1 and fpw 2 particulates respectively fig s8e based on our previous target and suspect chemical analysis hydrophobic organics such as pahs tend to adsorb on and accumulate in the particulates and nearly half of the semi quantified organics were bound to the solid phase of the fpw samples fig 2d he et al 2017a also characterized the morphology and elemental composition of suspended solids in fpw they suggest that iron oxides and silicates contain amphoteric surface functional groups that can interact electrostatically with cationic and anionic compounds metal and polar organic compounds could adsorb to their surface depending on the solution chemistry simultaneously the dissolution of carbonate minerals leads to the detachment of embedded pyrite grains making pyrite grains an important pathway for the mobilization of toxic elements in hydraulic fracturing operations and in groundwater systems containing shales kreisserman and emmanuel 2018 with suspended solids deposited from fpw settled at the bottom when entering the water body sediment can serve as a source and sink of hydrophobic persistent and hazardous compounds which present a long term chronic effect on aquatic organisms lu et al 2021 although organic contaminants were identified as one of the toxicity contributors to both fpw samples different toxicity was observed for their spe eluates as shown in fig 2c semi quantified organic chemicals in the aqueous phase of fpw 2 were four times higher than that in fpw 1 spe cartridges significantly mitigated the toxicity of fpw 1 attributed to organic chemicals but the eluates were not toxic enough to trigger significantly higher d rerio mortality compared to solvent controls fig 4b on the other hand the concentrations of organic contaminants in fpw 2 were too high to saturate the spe absorbents as a result not only the spe eluates caused significant mortality to d rerio but the remaining chemicals in residual water after spe were also highly toxic to d rerio in addition it is possible that small molecular compounds eluted from c18 cartridges using common solvents were the main organic toxicants in fpw 2 while some difficult to elute organic toxicants were present in fpw 1 as such further tie identification was performed focusing on the target and non target organic contaminants accumulated in organisms 3 4 chemical residues in organisms after fpw exposure 3 4 1 target analysis to identify organic contaminants in fpw that accumulated in organisms target suspect and non target analyses were performed for embryonic d rerio and g rarus that were exposed to fpw samples at their respective lc50 levels for 120 h exposure concentrations were selected to ensure that trace levels of organic chemicals in fish tissue can be quantified and they caused similar mortality for all samples exposure concentrations are detailed in table s11 target analytes included 16 pahs and 24 n alkanes c10 c33 as they were common petrogenic pollutants the concentrations of individual pahs and alkanes in fish tissues are summarized in fig 5 and tables s12 s15 eleven pahs mainly two three and four ring were detectable in fish with ʃpah ranging from 653 to 827 and 393 to 842 ng g wet weight ww for fpw exposed d rerio and g rarus respectively comparatively ʃpah in fpw 2 exposed fish was relatively higher than that in other treatments fig 5a and 5b alkane concentrations were found to be high in all exposed fish tissues and concentrations in d rerio were generally higher than that in g rarus fig 5c and 5d embryonic fish mainly take up organic chemicals in the aqueous phase through passive diffusion but small particles could still penetrate through embryo chorion pores 0 7 µm and deliver organic chemicals to vulnerable embryos he et al 2018 reported that pahs in a fpw sample collected from the devonian aged duvernay formation reached 18 100 ng l which was 10 times higher than another fpw sample collected from the same formation 1770 ng l alkanes are commonly present in hf media along with many other organic contaminants such as halogenated hydrocarbons phenols aldehydes and amines tao et al 2022 previous research analyzed organic compounds in fpw from the same sampling formation as our study and alkanes accounted for 48 58 of total organic matter and mostly c6 c21 alkanes and c7 c21 cycloalkanes wang et al 2020 similarly high levels of alkanes were found in water samples and fish after exposure to fpw in our study figs 2 5c and 5d chemical concentrations in water also varied greatly among six fpw samples but the variations in their internal concentrations in fish embryos were relatively small figs 2 and 5 this is because exposures were conducted at the concentrations corresponding to the respective lc50 values for individual samples as such tissue concentrations likely reached their critical body residues that are comparable among samples again highlighting the importance of quantifying bioavailable compounds within the risk assessment framework escher and hermens 2004 previous studies suggest that even short term exposure to pahs and their methylated derivatives can be highly toxic and teratogenic to fish embryos and crustaceans bragin et al 2016 incardona and scholz 2016 three ring pahs particularly phenanthrene dominated pahs toxicity in d rerio and were responsible for syndromes in embryonic fish including yolk sac body axis heartbeat and craniofacial abnormalities meador and nahrgang 2019 the predicted lr50 of phenanthrene to early life stage d rerio was 382 µg g incardona et al 2004 here ʃpah quantified in fpw exposed fish under respective lc50 levels was much lower than the lr50 of phenanthrene to d rerio the upper bound of ʃpah in d rerio was approximately 827 ng g which contributed only 0 2 of the lethality when pah toxicity was normalized to phenanthrene thus pahs quantified in fish tissue could contribute to but were less likely to be the dominant factor for fish mortality many studies overestimated the toxicity contribution of pahs in crude oil industries meador and nahrgang 2019 suggest that simply concluding pahs are the main toxicants for crude oil exposure is misleading and does not produce guideline values that can be useful for environmental protection while alkane concentrations were more than 10 times higher than pahs in fish their mortality contribution may still be trivial calling for further non target analysis 3 4 2 suspect analysis semi quantitative suspect analysis for 942 compounds identified trace levels of emerging contaminants in exposed d rerio and g rarus and the results are summarized in tables s16 and s17 similar to water samples the detected contaminants belong to diverse classes among them tris 2 ethylhexyl phosphate tehp a common plasticizer and fire retardant squalane lubricant additive spirodiclofen and pyridaben insecticides were present in all tissue samples and the fungicides propanmocarb and spiroxamine were also frequently identified in the exposed fish biocides are commonly applied in hf to eliminate bacteria that can cause corrosive byproducts kahrilas et al 2015 in addition the presence of surfactants plasticizers and friction reducers in the fpw exposed organisms was also reasonable as they are additives in hf organic chemicals quantified in d rerio were generally higher than those in g rarus with different chorion pore sizes and thicknesses d rerio may take up chemicals easier through both aqueous and particulate phases than g rarus notably embryonic fish exposed to treated fpw also contained high levels of organic contaminants meanwhile the doc content of treated fpw was still at relatively high levels after sewage treatment table s1 this implies that wastewater treatment processes at the shale gas production site failed to remediate some organic toxicants in fpw comprehensive analyses of the substances in shale gas fpw are necessary to develop an advanced treatment technology and achieve the sustainable development of shale gas production 3 4 3 non target analysis as shown in the tie characterization phase there were some substances in fpw that were difficult to elute from c18 cartridges e g large molecules and they can also be taken up by fish embryos previous studies identified polyethylene glycols alkyl ethoxylates octylphenol ethoxylates and other high molecular weight c49 c79 ethylene oxide polymers in fpw samples from north america he et al 2018 therefore non target analysis for surfactant related contaminants was conducted for exposed fish tissues based on level 1 and level 2 confidence schymanski et al 2015 non ionic surfactants ppg po 3 14 and 18 22 transformation products ppg n coohs po 4 12 and peg c eo 14 were identified in d rerio table s18 comparatively pegs eo 10 ppgs po 13 npeos eo 4 16 transformation products ppg c eo 6 and 10 and ionic surfactants including diallyldimethylammonium chloride dadmacc8 were identified in the exposed g rarus table s19 our study is the first to show that large molecular surfactants in fpw were bioavailable to fish highlighting the need for more attention to these chemicals interestingly different compositions of surfactants were identified in two fish species but the reason is still unknown as no toxicity thresholds for these surfactants are available their contribution to fish mortality was not estimated together the target analysis showed that pahs and alkanes c10 c33 are ubiquitous in fish after fpw exposure additionally based on suspect analysis of water and tissue samples 12 categories of suspect compounds were identified in fpw samples suggesting that a variety of contaminants may accumulate in exposed organisms since the chemicals detected in tissues only partially contributed to the overall toxicity with the complex nature of fpw it is difficult to specify compounds responsible for adverse effects to organisms alternatively transcriptome analysis was conducted to further illustrate the organic compound related toxic mechanism to inform chemical regulation 3 5 toxicity confirmation by transcriptome analysis because fpw 1 and fpw 2 are both post simulation water collected from the shale gas sites and elicited toxicity similar to d rerio embryos only fpw 1 was selected as the representative fpw for the transcription study meanwhile t fpw and leachate were also examined as different types of samples transcriptome sequencing identified 4183 3984 and 2670 genes that were significantly affected up or down regulated in fish embryos after exposure to fpw 1 t fpw and leachate samples respectively together 146 131 and 105 ontologies and 77 73 and 69 pathways were enriched in the respective samples in parallel 2524 contaminant induced genes were derived from the ctd according to the contaminants quantified in d rerio tissues and were potentially affected by fpw exposure by fusing the two sets of genomic data from transcriptome sequencing experiments and contaminant related data mining results matched ontologies and pathways were obtained to reveal potential toxicity contributions from organic compounds and the relevant toxicity mechanisms after fusing these genes fpw 1 and t fpw samples had the same ontology for the exposed fish embryos suggesting that wastewater treatment processes did not significantly modify the ontology caused by organic chemicals in both samples figs 6 a and 6b comparatively transcriptome results for zebrafish embryos exposed to the leachate were different from the two fpw samples fig 6c the contributions of synapse and catalytic activity were not present in the leachate exposed d rerio table s20 by comparing enriched pathways treated fpw removed the contribution of the apelin signaling pathway a pathway that induces early embryonic death by hormone that regulate the circulation system endoderm differentiation and heart development however the estrogen signaling pathway axon regeneration and relaxin signaling pathway were amplified after wastewater treatment fig 6d and 6e suggesting that treated fpw could potentially affect d rerio in neuronal survival and differentiation growth promoting effects of fin amputation and keratinocyte ablation and brain development table s21 in addition rna transport axon development adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes cushing syndrome aldosterone synthesis and secretion cortisol synthesis and secretion and phototransduction or fly are major pathways affected by fpw associated organics in d rerio leachate also affected pancreatic secretion in d rerio leading to cystic fibrosis neuronal migration and pathfinding in angiogenesis fig 6f meanwhile platelet activation thyroid hormone synthesis and endocrine and other factors regulated calcium reabsorption were identified kegg pathways in exposed d rerio together transcriptomic results suggest that organic compounds induced toxicity pathways were associated with fpw exposure and wastewater treatment processes did not effectively remove organic components from fpw which affected similar gene ontologies in zebrafish embryos wastewater treatment at the sampling site did not effectively remediate the potential toxicity including the affected genes and adverse pathways associated with the organic components in the fpw samples in addition since the high salinity of fpw could affect the composition of microbial communities and largely impact the effectiveness of fpw treatment technologies zhong et al 2021 accidental spill or direct discharge of treated fpw could cause potential adverse impacts to the receiving waters and local ecosystems which remains a great concern butkovskyi et al 2017 yost et al 2016 several advanced treatment strategies are proposed such as membrane separation thermal distillation adsorption advanced oxidation and biological treatments to remove prioritized organic compounds related to shale gas butkovskyi et al 2017 however a thorough assessment of fpw components including target and non target organic compounds would greatly benefit wastewater treatment design waste management and facilitate the transition towards sustainable uses of fpw such as in irrigation activities zhong et al 2021 3 6 environmental implications shale formations in china are generally more complex than those in north america sun et al 2021a a majority of shale formations in china are organically rich shale which relates to challenges such as extremely high well burial depth undulating surface conditions water shortage and unknown flowback contaminants dong et al 2015 ju et al 2014 leading to profound variations in fpw compositions furthermore the current development of shale gas in china is dominated by the state owned enterprises these entities are not required to release geological information or production data chen et al 2018 and the composition of hf varies by operators which are often kept as trade secrets both difficulties largely inhibit the identification and control of priority pollutants for shale gas exploitation currently the u s epa proposed 1173 hf related chemicals 1076 chemicals used in hfs and 134 chemicals detected in fpw 1026 87 of which lack comprehensive toxicological data yost et al 2016 although previous studies calculated the risk quotients for fpw and sludge through chemical analysis and modeling zhou et al 2022a ecological risks from shale gas exploration and the corresponding priority pollutants remain largely unknown high throughput screening hts data have not yet been widely applied in risk assessment due to the disconnect between endpoints measured in different approaches villeneuve et al 2019 thus our study attempts to link mechanistic level explanations with organism level endpoints to support extrapolation of hts data in future risk assessment for shale gas extraction activities other advanced solutions that integrate tie and effect directed analysis could diagnose toxicants with known and unknown identities in fpw li et al 2018 meanwhile incorporating big data e g gene information in toxicological risk assessments can provide connections between isolated exposure and effect data to identify shale gas related exposure characteristics for ecological risk assessments cheng et al 2020 2022 research also suggests that the way to fulfill the efficiency requirement mainly lies in improving the hf technology regarding water reuse or recycling of the used water during fracturing operations hu and xu 2013 treated fpw could be reused for irrigation livestock watering aquifer recharge or re injection as support water for water conservation however external emission or reuse of treated fpw needs to meet the required standards gb5084 2005 energy industry standards stipulate the internal reuse of fpw and priority control indicators include total salinity total hardness and ph but organic compounds that contributed significantly to toxicity are often ignored sun et al 2021b for decision making voluntary and mandatory measures are required to ensure adequate water allocation and reuse pollutant identification and remediation and efficient wastewater management the proposed tie approach with the confirmation of tissue residues and transcriptomic information presents a promising solution 4 conclusions unknown risks and driven factors dictate hf fpw which largely inhibit sustainable control and management of shale gas production in china our study evaluated the relative toxicity of a series of fpw samples to various freshwater organisms in china based on tie analyses major contaminants salinity particulates and organics were distinguished that trigger fpw toxicity alkanes pahs biocides and surfactants including large molecules were identified in d rerio and g rarus tissues contributing partial toxicity to the overall exposure by connecting mechanistic level explanations with organism level endpoints we were able to extrapolate hts data to confirm major organic contaminants induced toxicity in exposed organisms transcriptome sequencing in exposed d rerio embryos was fused with phenotype databases which served as toxicity confirmation to verify organic induced toxicity and demonstrate the probability of specific organic induced phenotypes in exposed d rerio it should be noted that sewage treatment plants for fpw failed to mitigate adverse outcomes associated with organic contaminants since there is no one size fits all approach for shale gas extraction future theoretical and technological investigations should be highly adaptive to identify and prioritize case specific toxicants during shale gas exploitation 5 supplementary information the

14702,hydraulic fracturing flowback and produced water hf fpw from shale gas extraction processes is a highly complex medium with potential threats to the environment current research on ecological risks of fpw in china is limited and the link between major components of fpw and their toxicological effects on freshwater organisms is largely unknown by integrating chemical and biological analyses toxicity identification evaluation tie was used to reveal causality between toxicity and contaminants potentially disentangling the complex toxicological nature of fpw here fpw from different shale gas wells treated fpw effluent and a leachate from hf sludge were collected from southwest china and tie was applied to obtain a comprehensive toxicity evaluation in freshwater organisms our results showed that fpw from the same geographic zone could cause significantly different toxicity salinity solid phase particulates and organic contaminants were identified as the main contributors to the toxicity of fpw in addition to water chemistry internal alkanes pahs and hf additives e g biocides and surfactants were quantified in exposed embryonic fish by target and non target tissue analyses the treated fpw failed to mitigate the toxicity associated with organic contaminants transcriptomic results illustrated that organic compounds induced toxicity pathways in fpw exposed embryonic zebrafish similar zebrafish gene ontologies were affected between treated and untreated fpw again confirming that sewage treatment did not effectively remove organic chemicals from fpw thus zebrafish transcriptome analyses revealed organic toxicant induced adverse outcome pathways and served as evidence for tie confirmation in complex mixtures under data poor scenarios graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords shale gas ecological risk from mixtures toxicity identification evaluation non target analysis organismal uptake transcriptomic analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction shale gas is an unconventional gas that has the potential to supply an ever growing energy demand stabilize soaring gas prices for global economic security and adequately transform global energy markets for the next few decades wang and li 2019 yang and thompson 2014 with the maturity of hydraulic fracturing hf techniques the current technically recoverable shale gas reserves in china are ranked at the top of the world eia 2015 gao et al 2021 however hf demands large amounts of water carrero parreño et al 2017 and potentially causes environmental challenges kerr 2010 lutz et al 2013 thereby inhibiting the sustainable progress of unconventional resources in china li et al 2022 one challenge is the ecological risk associated with the generation of large volumes of flowback and produced water fpw complex wastewater that returns to the surface after hf activity zhong et al 2021 the fpw is a tripartite mixture of injected drilling fluid components deep formation water and secondary byproducts of downhole reactions with the formation environment drollette et al 2015 llewellyn et al 2015 previous investigations have reported that fpw contains high levels of inorganic salts metals organics total dissolved solids tds folkerts et al 2020 stringfellow et al 2014 dissolved organic matter dom butkovskyi et al 2017 and naturally occurring radioactive materials zhou et al 2022a and these substances could elicit ecological risks when not properly managed before disposal or reuse although ecotoxicological research on fpw in china is scarce many studies in north america have examined fpw toxicity to freshwater and marine organisms and concluded that high salinity is a main driving factor blewett et al 2017 folkerts et al 2019 various organic components in fpw such as biocides surfactants endocrine disrupting chemicals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are also harmful to freshwater organisms blewett et al 2017 elliott et al 2017 he et al 2017b additionally metals and metal organic complexes in fpw are capable of enhancing the toxicity of organic contaminants folkerts et al 2019 mehler et al 2021 fpw samples from the marcellus shale play in the u s have been shown to contain high levels of barium bromide 228ra strontium and other salts kuwayama et al 2013 high levels of radioactive chemicals 238u and 226ra have also been detected in wastewater sludges from the sichuan basin shale in china which may cause environmental risk zhou et al 2022a these studies suggest that the aquatic toxicity of fpw is noteworthy and complicated however causality investigations between various contaminants and ecotoxicological effects on freshwater organisms are limited making it difficult to identify and prioritize major toxic components the composition of fpw is highly variable and region specific due to the heterogeneity of geologic formations and different chemical contributions of returning fpw stringfellow et al 2014 changes in geographic locations and chemical compositions of fracturing fluid can result in varying ecological risks of fpw for example he et al 2018 detected distinct organic compositions of two fpw samples from the same geological region and these samples exhibited different developmental toxicity to zebrafish embryos furthermore mixtures of oil and water based fluids are typically applied during hydraulic fracturing in china leading to the return of various types of fpw to the surface and eliciting different adverse outcomes which require urgent investigation toxicity identification evaluation tie has been developed to identify the main toxicants in complex mixtures since the 1990s epa 1991 by integrating chemical and biological analyses tie techniques have been shown to be promising approaches for understanding the causality between toxicity and contaminants recent development in transcriptomic analysis suggests that gene information is closely related to toxicant induced adverse outcome pathways demonstrating that transcriptomics can serve as an additional line of evidence for tie confirmation antczak et al 2013 in the present study aquatic toxicities of four fpw samples from different shale gas wells fpw effluent from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and leachate from flowback sludges collected from sichuan china were examined using multiple ecologically relevant vertebrates including a native fish species and an invertebrate species potential toxicants were characterized using a tie approach supported by target and non target analyses of internal organic chemical residues toxicogenomics of d rerio after exposure to fpw was assessed to provide effect driven evidence for tie confirmation as well as to demonstrate the treatment efficiency of wwtp the present study aims to reveal the risk of shale gas development in local freshwater ecosystems prioritize the main components that trigger aquatic toxicity and support future sustainable shale gas production in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample description sichuan basin is the major shale gas exploration area in china accounting for more than 90 of shale gas reserves in china 2021 five fpw and one sludge samples were collected from the changning state level operation zone in sichuan basin shale this site has been constructed by the petrochina southwest oil gasfield company since march 2012 fpw 1 and fpw 2 were post simulation water collected at 413 and 347 d respectively after initial fracturing from two oil based hf wells no additional fracturing was performed afterwards so both samples should reflect long term residuals and other components produced from the shale formation fpw 3 was collected from a central collection site containing mixed fpw before wastewater treatment facilities while fpw 4 was collected from an open pooled water storage with an average retention time of 10 d before the fpw flows to the central collection system a treated fpw effluent t fpw was also sampled from a centralized shale gas wwtp which collected 400 800 m3 of wastewater mainly fpw daily from 75 wells at different flowback stages from several weeks to three years zhou et al 2022a in addition to fpw samples a leachate sample from flowback sludge was collected flowback sludge is a mixture of oil based drilling cuttings and drilling mud collected during the hydraulic drilling and fracturing stage the sludge was washed with clean water and went through solid liquid separation the solid phase is compressed as mud cakes and used as raw materials for unfired bricks and the leachate requires further treatment before entering the environment all samples were collected in brown glass bottles the samples were filled to eliminate air space and stored at 4 c to avoid possible degradation before chemical and toxicological analyses acute toxicity tests were completed within two weeks of sample collection 2 2 water chemistry parameters and inorganics in fpw samples water chemistry parameters were analyzed for the fpw and leachate samples including dissolved organic carbon doc contents total dissolved solids conductivity salinity ph hardness and alkalinity table s1 in addition five anions in water samples were quantified with a dionex dx 600 ion chromatography installed with an as9 hc analytical column an ag9 hc guard column and an asrs ultra suppressor 4 mm metals metalloids and total sulfur and phosphorus in water samples were measured with agilent 5110 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes and agilent 7900 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms in addition particulates in selected fpw samples fpw 1 and fpw 2 were collected by filtering through a glass fiber filter membrane gff whatman maidstone uk 90 mm diameter 0 7 μm pore size sediments were rinsed with ultrapure water to remove residual brine and prevent salt precipitation samples were then covered air dried and then mounted on aluminum sem tabs ted pella inc redding ca usa the morphology of solids in fpw 1 and fpw 2 were performed by a thermo helios 5 cx scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analysis using an oxford ultim max 65 detector 2 3 organic compounds in fpw samples to analyze organic constituents in fpw the samples were separated to aqueous w and solid particle s phases by filtering 100 ml of each sample through a gff membrane aqueous filtrate samples were extracted by liquid liquid extraction using dichloromethane and cleaned with florisil solid phase extraction spe cartridges collected particles were freeze dried extracted with a thermo fisher ase 350 accelerated solvent extractor using a mixture solution of hexane dichloromethane and acetone mixture 2 2 1 v v v and purified using a silica alumina column for target analyses 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and 24 n alkanes c10 c33 were analyzed using a shimadzu tq 8040 gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry gc ms ms in selective ion mode with electron impact ionization furthermore 942 suspect chemicals were identified and semi quantified by gc ms ms in full scan mode using the compound composer software detailed procedures for analyzing organic constituents from the water w and particle s phases are summarized in the supporting information si 2 4 testing organisms the freshwater invertebrate daphnia magna and embryonic vertebrates danio rerio and gobiocypris rarus were selected as model organisms to assess the toxicity of fpw d magna is sensitive to various contaminants and have been utilized as an indicator species for assessing freshwater quality zebrafish d rerio and chinese rare minnows g rarus are ideal vertebrate models because of their high sensitivity to anthropogenic contaminants during development transparency for visual observations and well studied sublethal endpoints although d rerio has been accepted worldwide for chemical hazard assessment g rarus is a native species that originated in sichuan china and has been recently required as a native alternative animal model for chemical toxicity evaluation in china bai et al 2021 both fish embryos were collected from group spawns and staged to ensure all embryos were 6 8 h post fertilization hpf and d magna neonates 24 h were pre acclimated for acute toxicity tests detailed procedures for organism culture and fish embryo collection are provided in the si 2 5 toxicity identification evaluation tie 2 5 1 tie screening toxicity tests to characterize fpw toxicity and identify the main drivers a tie method was applied including toxicity screening characterization identification and confirmation fig 1 first the toxicity of five fpw samples and sludge leachate was examined using the three species according to the oecd test guidelines with minor modifications oecd 2004 2013 a series of range finding tests were performed for all species prior to acute lethal toxicity analyses to ensure that proper dilutions of fpw were used to accurately acquire median lethal concentration lc50 values of each fpw sample the final fpw dilution fractions used for individual treatment levels during the screening tests are summarized in table s2 for d magna fpw and leachate were diluted with aerated tap water to various concentrations at a fixed volume of 20 ml adult d magna 10 per replicate was transferred to each beaker to initiate 48 h exposure each treatment level was carried out with six replicates at 22 0 5 c with a 16 8 h light dark photoperiod under full spectrum fluorescent grow lights in addition to these directly diluted fpw samples the toxicity of fpw 2 to d magna was also examined after filtration through 0 22 μm nylon membranes before fish embryo toxicity tests fet embryo viability was examined under a stereomicroscope szx 7 olympus tokyo japan following a method described by kimmel et al 1995 embryos were staged to ensure 6 hpf at the beginning of the experiment fish embryos were introduced into each well in 96 well plates and exposed to a gradient of fpw dilutions the d rerio exposure media was diluted in the fpw samples with embryo culture media at various concentrations and the g rarus exposure media was diluted in aerated tap water at concentrations ranging from 2 5 to 50 table s2 embryo mortality and malformations were examined daily until 120 hpf to examine developmental toxicity by fpw each treatment contained three replicates with 12 embryos per replicate the embryos were exposed at 28 0 5 c with a 14 10 light dark photoperiod due to the high complexity of fpw samples and the relatively short duration of the test exposure media were not renewed throughout the acute toxicity tests and the plates were covered with parafilm to minimize water evaporation at the end of the 120 h exposure survived d rerio and g rarus were rinsed with mill q water dried with tissues and weighed and chemical residues in the organisms were analyzed in addition dose response relationships of individual organisms to salinity were evaluated using nacl solutions tissue sample preparation and instrumental analysis procedures are detailed in the si 2 5 2 tie toxicity characterization as fpw 1 and fpw 2 were direct post simulation water directly collected from different sampling wells without storage tie characterization was further conducted for these two samples using zebrafish embryos as test species following the usepa procedure with minor modifications fig 1 norberg king et al 1991 in brief fpw 1 and fpw 2 were diluted with embryo culture media to 30 and 20 of the original settings respectively each fpw sample was filtered through 0 7 μm gff membrane to remove particles samples were then passed through c18 spe cartridges for retaining organic compounds and the eluate was collected in parallel ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 12 mg l and sodium thiosulphate sts 50 mg l were added individually to the filtered fpw to determine the presence of cationic metals and oxidative agents respectively hockett and mount 1996 the toxicity of the samples after tie manipulations was assessed and compared with the original and filtered fpw additionally 5 ml of methanol and 5 ml of a mixture of dichloromethane and hexane 1 1 v v were used to elute moderately polar and non polar compounds respectively from spe cartridges that enriched organic contaminants in fpw after solvent exchanged to 2 dimethyl sulfoxide dmso the two eluates were also used for toxicity evaluation the toxicity of solvent controls 2 dmso and 2 methanol was assessed with fish embryo testing concurrently each exposure and the corresponding control contain 12 embryos and all treatments were examined in triplicate 2 5 3 tie toxicity identification by target and non target tissue analyses as organics were found to contribute to fpw toxicity during tie characterization chemical analysis was performed for target and non target contaminants in survived fish after exposure to fpw samples at their respective lc50 in addition to analyzing contaminants in water samples considering small size of tissue samples and instrumental sensitivity exposed organisms from the same treatment level were pooled together for chemical analyses n 1 since the organic composition of fpw is complex and the lack of reference standards makes quantification difficult non target contaminants were only screened in exposed fish to show potential internalized surfactant related organic chemicals using agilent 1290 6545 huplc q tof ms details on tissue sample preparation and instrumental analysis are provided in the si and table s3 2 5 4 tie toxicity confirmation by transcriptome sequencing fpw 1 was selected as the representative fpw sample for transcriptome sequencing in exposed embryonic zebrafish meanwhile t fpw was chosen to reveal the efficacy of wwtp in toxicity remediation while the leachate represented a different sample related to shale gas by products for data analysis read counts were normalized based on desseq2 with fdr and log2fc values being calculated love et al 2014 significantly different genes were discriminated based on fdr 0 05 and log2fc 1 and a list of differentially expressed genes degs in the fish samples was obtained owens et al 2019 significant degs observed in the comparative toxicogenomics database ctd were collected to illustrate genes that could be affected by chemical toxicants in fpw davis et al 2021 both sets of genes were compared to identify matched genes and then gene ontology go gene ontology consortium 2004 and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg kanehisa and goto 2000 enrichment analyses were performed to obtain ontology and pathway information respectively subramanian et al 2005 finally phenotypic features from ctd and pubmed databases were fused to obtain phenotypic features associated with these ontologies and pathways for tie confirmation 2 6 quality assurance and quality control to ensure analytical quality instrumental performance was verified by analyzing a calibration standard every 10 samples for gc ms ms variations among calibration standard checks were within 20 solvent blanks matrix blanks and matrix spikes and duplicates were assessed simultaneously with the samples recoveries in the range of 50 150 with relative standard deviations less than 20 were considered acceptable for most compounds except for the volatile di and tri cyclic pahs whose recovery of 30 was also acceptable recoveries of surrogates and pahs in matrix spikes are shown in fig s1 to ensure the reliability of the suspect screening results solvent and matrix blanks were analyzed along with the samples no compound was detected in the blanks thermal degradation of p p ddt was checked every 10 samples and a decomposition less than 15 was considered acceptable in addition a mixture standard containing 16 pahs 19 organochlorine pesticides ocps and six pyrethroids 200 μg l of each compound was analyzed to ensure the reliability of the compound composer method all test compounds were all accurately identified and semi quantitative results ranged from 115 to 454 μg l with relative errors of 101 47 4 2 7 statistics organism mortality under various exposure concentrations was fitted to a four parameter logistic model to calculate the corresponding lc50 values in sigmaplot v14 0 normality was evaluated using the kolmogorov smirnov one sample test and homogeneity of variance was determined by the levene s test a logarithmic transformation was performed if necessary to meet the assumptions statistical differences in lc50 values of the same organism among various sample treatments were analyzed using the litchfield wilcoxon method when treatments share similar exposure concentration gradients for those treatments with various diluted fractions as exposure gradients the lc50 values that had no overlapping 95 cis were considered significantly different folkerts et al 2019 one way analysis of variance anova followed by holm sidak post hoc test was employed to evaluate statistical differences in d rerio mortality among tie treatments statistical differences at a p value 0 05 were considered significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 major contaminants identified in fpw and leachate samples inorganic analyses revealed high concentrations of na cl ca k and mg in all water samples tables s4 s6 leachate had the highest ion concentrations followed by fpw 1 and fpw 2 which were freshly collected on site a similar trend was observed in tds readings with the highest value in the leachate 52 1 g l although the leachate had the highest value doc contents varied across fpw samples fpw 3 and t fpw had similar doc contents and fpw 3 was from the centralized produced water collection system before wwtp implying that wastewater treatment may not be effective for removing organic contaminants table s1 furthermore high levels of sr were found in all samples ba and li were detectable in all fpw samples except for the leachate outside these constituents br was also found at high concentrations up to 67 mg l in leachate and fpw samples table s4 previous investigations reported that the tds of fpw collected in the sichuan basin ranged from 13 7 to 38 9 g l huang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 which was generally lower than that previously documented in the u s 183 243 g l he et al 2018 in our collected samples leachate had comparable tds values 52 1 g l with previous studies in the same shale formation while the tds in other fpw samples was lower 1 27 2 17 g l likely due to the long post simulation time since the initial fracturing organic contaminants were quantified in aqueous and particle phases of fpw samples and the distribution of pahs between the two phases is shown in fig 2 a organic profiles revealed that fpw 2 had substantially higher concentrations of pahs than the remaining samples and three and four ring compounds were the dominant pahs phenanthrene was often found at high levels in all samples with total concentrations aqueous and particle phases ranging from 400 to 1137 ng l table s7 additionally pyrene was detected at high concentrations in fpw 2 particles and dominated pah compositions in both phases of fpw 4 most samples had higher pah content in particle phase fpw 1 34 66 fpw 2 21 79 fpw 3 14 86 t fpw 31 69 while the phase distribution of pahs was uniform in fpw 4 53 47 and leachate 47 53 more alkanes c10 c33 were found in the particles than in the aqueous phase and alkanes with short carbon chains c10 c24 dominated the distribution in both phases fig 2b and table s8 previous studies suggest that short chain alkanes tend to be exacerbated by anthropogenic stressors zhang et al 2019 beyond these target pahs and alkanes suspect analysis semi quantified 10 additional categories of organic compounds e g ethers fatty acids pesticides and biocides in fpw samples fig 2c 2d and table s9 taken together fpw 2 contained the highest levels of organic compounds the results of water chemistry demonstrate that fpw compositions varied likely depends on well locations and the time of flowback collection 3 2 toxicity of fpw to different organisms the acute toxicity of fpw samples to freshwater organisms was examined as percentages of dilution during tie screening toxicity tests fig 3 and table s10 and their dose response curves are presented in fig s2 the toxicity of fpw 1 and fpw 2 was not significantly different for both fish embryos but fpw 2 was surprisingly highly toxic to d magna fpw 3 was less toxic to d rerio than other fpw samples the toxicity of fpw 4 to d magna was comparable to other fpw samples whereas it was more toxic to zebrafish embryos but much less toxic to embryonic g rarus than other samples treated fpw significantly reduced mortality to d rerio and d magna but unexpectedly it provoked higher mortality to g rarus than untreated fpw samples comparatively fpw sludge leachate had the highest toxicity among all samples to all species except that it showed less toxicity to d magna than fpw 2 testing organisms showed varying susceptibility to fpw samples while d rerio embryos had higher susceptibility than g rarus to some fpw samples fpw 2 and fpw 4 g rarus were more sensitive to the treated fpw than other species and samples fig 3 as detailed in the daily monitored mortality fig s4 t fpw exposed to g rarus showed relatively low mortality during the first 96 h but the mortality dramatically increased in the last 24 h of the exposure period zhou et al 2022b demonstrated that g rarus are more susceptible to metals and some neurotoxicants than d rerio and the two species had distinct embryo chorion pore size and thickness as shown in table s1 t fpw contained the lowest salinity and particulate concentration among all samples and the levels of majority of metals in t fpw were lower than those in other fpw samples tables s5 and s6 as such metals might not be the reason for the elevated toxicity of t fpw to g rarus in comparison with other fpw samples on the other hand doc content in t fpw was much higher than that in other fpw samples a previous study showed that some conventional wwtp performed poorly in the removal of organic contaminants liu et al 2022 the removal efficiencies are related to chemical hydrophobicity with a relatively higher removal efficiency for hydrophobic but less effective for hydrophilic and low to moderate hydrophobic contaminants meanwhile biological treatment systems in wwtp might reflux activated sludge during anaerobic and anoxic stages and the process could result in organic pollution amplification česonienė et al 2019 some of the main contaminants that were more sensitive to g rarus likely remained in water after wastewater treatment jiang et al 2015 found that g rarus was more sensitive to fenvalerate than embryonic zebrafish and at other life stages meanwhile a study analyzed the difference in sensitivity between g rarus and d rerio embryos they found that the 96 h lc50s of zinc sulfate potassium dichromate and 2 3h benzothiazolone were significantly lower in g rarus than that in d rerio embryo suggesting g rarus maybe more susceptible to certain chemicals wang et al 2021 both fpw 3 and t fpw had relatively higher doc than other fpw samples which corresponded to their relatively higher toxicity to g rarus than to d rerio however current chemical analysis was not able to distinguish major contaminants in the treated fpw that triggered a high toxicity to g rarus specifically it is worth pursuing in the future through non target screening to identify and verify main toxicants causing the toxicity in t fpw to g rarus unlike fish embryos fpw 2 provoked the highest mortality in the crustaceans fig 3c organic chemicals detected in fpw 2 were much higher than those detected in fpw 1 especially in the particle phase fig 2 to distinguish toxicity contribution from particulates suspended particles in fpw were removed by filtering through 0 22 µm membranes the toxicity of filtered fpw 1 and 2 to d magna was substantially mitigated and lc50 increased from 14 to 27 for fpw 1 and from 0 7 to 25 for fpw 2 by filtration fig 3c and s5 comparable lc50s between the filtered samples suggest that a significant toxicity difference in d magna between fpw 1 and 2 largely originated from the particulates diverse organic contaminants including pahs alkyl pahs and organophosphate esters were previously detected in the fpw particulates he et al 2018 as a filter feeder it is possible that d magna ingested suspended particulates during feeding and their constant movement gathered particles in their antennas and thoracopods wu et al 2017 resulting in chemical accumulation and high toxicity furthermore doc normalization reduced the toxicity difference between the two fpw samples although fpw 2 was still approximately two times more toxic to d magna lc50s of 7 6 and 3 4 mg doc l for fpw 1 and 2 respectively fig s5 the immobility of d manga was previously reported as a sensitive endpoint related to the high organic content in fpw blewett et al 2018 excessive waterborne surfactants can decrease surface tension and floating hydrocarbons adhere to d magna breaking through the water surface and preventing submergence this physical damage associated with organic surfactants may be partially attributed to the mortality of d magna collectively freshwater organisms are susceptible to fpw exposures but adverse outcomes are species and fpw type dependent in general fet tests showed protective effects for native species while d magna was particularly sensitive to solid particles in addition fpw from different sampling wells had distinct toxicity to organisms which was also observed in previous investigations of other shale gas formations golding et al 2022 thus site specific risk assessments are necessary for fpw management 3 3 tie characterization of fpw to d rerio the toxicity tests for aquatic species verified the presence of fpw toxicity and further tie manipulations were performed the toxicants can be tentatively characterized as substances whose toxicity is ph sensitive non polar organics oxidants cationic metals and others liu et al 2022 fpw 1 and fpw 2 were selected to further investigate the toxicity contribution of various components d rerio was selected as the test organism for the tie experiment due to its relatively high sensitivity and rapid development for toxicity screening the toxicity of the original fpw 1 and fpw 2 samples and the tie manipulated samples to zebrafish embryos is shown in fig 4 original fpw 1 and fpw 2 samples were diluted to 30 and 20 respectively for tie experiments to ensure a toxicity reduction was detectable since sodium and chloride were the dominant cation and anion in fpw 1 and fpw 2 both exceeded 6800 mg l of na and 12 000 mg l of cl nacl was used to examine the potential toxicity contribution from salinity after 30 and 20 dilution sodium concentrations were 2040 and 1380 mg l in fpw 1 and fpw 2 respectively the corresponding mortality in d rerio caused by the similar concentrations of nacl could reach 81 7 ci 73 4 90 1 for fpw 1 and 56 4 ci 48 6 64 1 for fpw 2 fig s6 and s7 this implied that salinity especially nacl was likely a major contributor to fpw samples interestingly after individual tie manipulations the toxicity of fpw 1 and fpw 2 behaved distinctly toward d rerio although there is no significant reduction in d rerio mortality after the removal of particulates by filtration for fpw 1 the toxicity decreased considerably further passing through a c18 spe cartridge fig 4a this indicated that waterborne organic contaminants contributed substantially to fpw 1 toxicity and were removed by spe absorbents the sorbed chemicals were then eluted out of the cartridge using methanol and a mixture of hexane and dichloromethane solvent exchanged to dmso sequentially the mortality of the eluates was not significantly different from that of solvent controls fig 4b the saline control was not significantly different from the sample treated with spe suggesting that residual toxicity after spe treatment was mainly from the salinity adding edta or sts changed the mortality little however it could not conclude that there were no toxic metals and oxidants as their toxicity contributions may be masked by high salinity fpw 2 toxicity was reduced by approximately 40 after filtration implying that solid particles contributed considerable toxicity to d rerio fig 4c it may be related to the high level of contaminants in the particulates of this sample fig 2 although the c18 spe did not further reduce embryonic mortality the eluate from the spe cartridge elicited significantly higher mortality to d rerio compared with solvent controls particularly the methanol eluate fig 4d this implies that hydrophilic compounds substantially contributed to the observed toxicity while hydrophobic compounds were possible toxicity drivers residual water after spe was still highly toxic to d rerio but it was not significantly different from the saline control our result showed that the salinity still contributed a great amount of toxicity approximately 60 in fpw 2 filtered particulates and organics may be responsible for the remaining embryo mortality like fpw 1 edta and sts additions did not alter the toxicity of the filtered fpw 2 sample together tie manipulations concluded that salinity particulates and organics were major contributors to fpw toxicity particulates also attributed partial toxicity and led to embryo mortality previous studies have also concluded that particle rich fpw possessed greater toxicity than the filtered particle free samples he et al 2017b during fracturing and production fluids in contact with shales can react chemically with mineral assemblages within the rock by leaching sorbed species from mineral surfaces or dissolving the mineral phase li et al 2017 warner et al 2014 through sem we identified many amorphous and porous particulates that were likely aggregated by many small sphere solids and fragments to form various sized particles fig s8 eds was performed on several spots of individual particulate to measure their approximate elemental compositions the main composition of particulates in fpw 1 was composed of silica 48 4 7 oxygen 22 2 9 carbon 12 0 9 iron 8 2 1 and platinum 6 2 1 by weight similarly main compositions were silica 41 4 3 oxygen 24 3 0 carbon 18 0 9 iron 10 1 6 and platinum 5 0 9 in fpw 2 particulates these elements accounted for over 96 and 98 by weight of inorganic compositions in fpw 1 and fpw 2 particulates respectively fig s8e based on our previous target and suspect chemical analysis hydrophobic organics such as pahs tend to adsorb on and accumulate in the particulates and nearly half of the semi quantified organics were bound to the solid phase of the fpw samples fig 2d he et al 2017a also characterized the morphology and elemental composition of suspended solids in fpw they suggest that iron oxides and silicates contain amphoteric surface functional groups that can interact electrostatically with cationic and anionic compounds metal and polar organic compounds could adsorb to their surface depending on the solution chemistry simultaneously the dissolution of carbonate minerals leads to the detachment of embedded pyrite grains making pyrite grains an important pathway for the mobilization of toxic elements in hydraulic fracturing operations and in groundwater systems containing shales kreisserman and emmanuel 2018 with suspended solids deposited from fpw settled at the bottom when entering the water body sediment can serve as a source and sink of hydrophobic persistent and hazardous compounds which present a long term chronic effect on aquatic organisms lu et al 2021 although organic contaminants were identified as one of the toxicity contributors to both fpw samples different toxicity was observed for their spe eluates as shown in fig 2c semi quantified organic chemicals in the aqueous phase of fpw 2 were four times higher than that in fpw 1 spe cartridges significantly mitigated the toxicity of fpw 1 attributed to organic chemicals but the eluates were not toxic enough to trigger significantly higher d rerio mortality compared to solvent controls fig 4b on the other hand the concentrations of organic contaminants in fpw 2 were too high to saturate the spe absorbents as a result not only the spe eluates caused significant mortality to d rerio but the remaining chemicals in residual water after spe were also highly toxic to d rerio in addition it is possible that small molecular compounds eluted from c18 cartridges using common solvents were the main organic toxicants in fpw 2 while some difficult to elute organic toxicants were present in fpw 1 as such further tie identification was performed focusing on the target and non target organic contaminants accumulated in organisms 3 4 chemical residues in organisms after fpw exposure 3 4 1 target analysis to identify organic contaminants in fpw that accumulated in organisms target suspect and non target analyses were performed for embryonic d rerio and g rarus that were exposed to fpw samples at their respective lc50 levels for 120 h exposure concentrations were selected to ensure that trace levels of organic chemicals in fish tissue can be quantified and they caused similar mortality for all samples exposure concentrations are detailed in table s11 target analytes included 16 pahs and 24 n alkanes c10 c33 as they were common petrogenic pollutants the concentrations of individual pahs and alkanes in fish tissues are summarized in fig 5 and tables s12 s15 eleven pahs mainly two three and four ring were detectable in fish with ʃpah ranging from 653 to 827 and 393 to 842 ng g wet weight ww for fpw exposed d rerio and g rarus respectively comparatively ʃpah in fpw 2 exposed fish was relatively higher than that in other treatments fig 5a and 5b alkane concentrations were found to be high in all exposed fish tissues and concentrations in d rerio were generally higher than that in g rarus fig 5c and 5d embryonic fish mainly take up organic chemicals in the aqueous phase through passive diffusion but small particles could still penetrate through embryo chorion pores 0 7 µm and deliver organic chemicals to vulnerable embryos he et al 2018 reported that pahs in a fpw sample collected from the devonian aged duvernay formation reached 18 100 ng l which was 10 times higher than another fpw sample collected from the same formation 1770 ng l alkanes are commonly present in hf media along with many other organic contaminants such as halogenated hydrocarbons phenols aldehydes and amines tao et al 2022 previous research analyzed organic compounds in fpw from the same sampling formation as our study and alkanes accounted for 48 58 of total organic matter and mostly c6 c21 alkanes and c7 c21 cycloalkanes wang et al 2020 similarly high levels of alkanes were found in water samples and fish after exposure to fpw in our study figs 2 5c and 5d chemical concentrations in water also varied greatly among six fpw samples but the variations in their internal concentrations in fish embryos were relatively small figs 2 and 5 this is because exposures were conducted at the concentrations corresponding to the respective lc50 values for individual samples as such tissue concentrations likely reached their critical body residues that are comparable among samples again highlighting the importance of quantifying bioavailable compounds within the risk assessment framework escher and hermens 2004 previous studies suggest that even short term exposure to pahs and their methylated derivatives can be highly toxic and teratogenic to fish embryos and crustaceans bragin et al 2016 incardona and scholz 2016 three ring pahs particularly phenanthrene dominated pahs toxicity in d rerio and were responsible for syndromes in embryonic fish including yolk sac body axis heartbeat and craniofacial abnormalities meador and nahrgang 2019 the predicted lr50 of phenanthrene to early life stage d rerio was 382 µg g incardona et al 2004 here ʃpah quantified in fpw exposed fish under respective lc50 levels was much lower than the lr50 of phenanthrene to d rerio the upper bound of ʃpah in d rerio was approximately 827 ng g which contributed only 0 2 of the lethality when pah toxicity was normalized to phenanthrene thus pahs quantified in fish tissue could contribute to but were less likely to be the dominant factor for fish mortality many studies overestimated the toxicity contribution of pahs in crude oil industries meador and nahrgang 2019 suggest that simply concluding pahs are the main toxicants for crude oil exposure is misleading and does not produce guideline values that can be useful for environmental protection while alkane concentrations were more than 10 times higher than pahs in fish their mortality contribution may still be trivial calling for further non target analysis 3 4 2 suspect analysis semi quantitative suspect analysis for 942 compounds identified trace levels of emerging contaminants in exposed d rerio and g rarus and the results are summarized in tables s16 and s17 similar to water samples the detected contaminants belong to diverse classes among them tris 2 ethylhexyl phosphate tehp a common plasticizer and fire retardant squalane lubricant additive spirodiclofen and pyridaben insecticides were present in all tissue samples and the fungicides propanmocarb and spiroxamine were also frequently identified in the exposed fish biocides are commonly applied in hf to eliminate bacteria that can cause corrosive byproducts kahrilas et al 2015 in addition the presence of surfactants plasticizers and friction reducers in the fpw exposed organisms was also reasonable as they are additives in hf organic chemicals quantified in d rerio were generally higher than those in g rarus with different chorion pore sizes and thicknesses d rerio may take up chemicals easier through both aqueous and particulate phases than g rarus notably embryonic fish exposed to treated fpw also contained high levels of organic contaminants meanwhile the doc content of treated fpw was still at relatively high levels after sewage treatment table s1 this implies that wastewater treatment processes at the shale gas production site failed to remediate some organic toxicants in fpw comprehensive analyses of the substances in shale gas fpw are necessary to develop an advanced treatment technology and achieve the sustainable development of shale gas production 3 4 3 non target analysis as shown in the tie characterization phase there were some substances in fpw that were difficult to elute from c18 cartridges e g large molecules and they can also be taken up by fish embryos previous studies identified polyethylene glycols alkyl ethoxylates octylphenol ethoxylates and other high molecular weight c49 c79 ethylene oxide polymers in fpw samples from north america he et al 2018 therefore non target analysis for surfactant related contaminants was conducted for exposed fish tissues based on level 1 and level 2 confidence schymanski et al 2015 non ionic surfactants ppg po 3 14 and 18 22 transformation products ppg n coohs po 4 12 and peg c eo 14 were identified in d rerio table s18 comparatively pegs eo 10 ppgs po 13 npeos eo 4 16 transformation products ppg c eo 6 and 10 and ionic surfactants including diallyldimethylammonium chloride dadmacc8 were identified in the exposed g rarus table s19 our study is the first to show that large molecular surfactants in fpw were bioavailable to fish highlighting the need for more attention to these chemicals interestingly different compositions of surfactants were identified in two fish species but the reason is still unknown as no toxicity thresholds for these surfactants are available their contribution to fish mortality was not estimated together the target analysis showed that pahs and alkanes c10 c33 are ubiquitous in fish after fpw exposure additionally based on suspect analysis of water and tissue samples 12 categories of suspect compounds were identified in fpw samples suggesting that a variety of contaminants may accumulate in exposed organisms since the chemicals detected in tissues only partially contributed to the overall toxicity with the complex nature of fpw it is difficult to specify compounds responsible for adverse effects to organisms alternatively transcriptome analysis was conducted to further illustrate the organic compound related toxic mechanism to inform chemical regulation 3 5 toxicity confirmation by transcriptome analysis because fpw 1 and fpw 2 are both post simulation water collected from the shale gas sites and elicited toxicity similar to d rerio embryos only fpw 1 was selected as the representative fpw for the transcription study meanwhile t fpw and leachate were also examined as different types of samples transcriptome sequencing identified 4183 3984 and 2670 genes that were significantly affected up or down regulated in fish embryos after exposure to fpw 1 t fpw and leachate samples respectively together 146 131 and 105 ontologies and 77 73 and 69 pathways were enriched in the respective samples in parallel 2524 contaminant induced genes were derived from the ctd according to the contaminants quantified in d rerio tissues and were potentially affected by fpw exposure by fusing the two sets of genomic data from transcriptome sequencing experiments and contaminant related data mining results matched ontologies and pathways were obtained to reveal potential toxicity contributions from organic compounds and the relevant toxicity mechanisms after fusing these genes fpw 1 and t fpw samples had the same ontology for the exposed fish embryos suggesting that wastewater treatment processes did not significantly modify the ontology caused by organic chemicals in both samples figs 6 a and 6b comparatively transcriptome results for zebrafish embryos exposed to the leachate were different from the two fpw samples fig 6c the contributions of synapse and catalytic activity were not present in the leachate exposed d rerio table s20 by comparing enriched pathways treated fpw removed the contribution of the apelin signaling pathway a pathway that induces early embryonic death by hormone that regulate the circulation system endoderm differentiation and heart development however the estrogen signaling pathway axon regeneration and relaxin signaling pathway were amplified after wastewater treatment fig 6d and 6e suggesting that treated fpw could potentially affect d rerio in neuronal survival and differentiation growth promoting effects of fin amputation and keratinocyte ablation and brain development table s21 in addition rna transport axon development adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes cushing syndrome aldosterone synthesis and secretion cortisol synthesis and secretion and phototransduction or fly are major pathways affected by fpw associated organics in d rerio leachate also affected pancreatic secretion in d rerio leading to cystic fibrosis neuronal migration and pathfinding in angiogenesis fig 6f meanwhile platelet activation thyroid hormone synthesis and endocrine and other factors regulated calcium reabsorption were identified kegg pathways in exposed d rerio together transcriptomic results suggest that organic compounds induced toxicity pathways were associated with fpw exposure and wastewater treatment processes did not effectively remove organic components from fpw which affected similar gene ontologies in zebrafish embryos wastewater treatment at the sampling site did not effectively remediate the potential toxicity including the affected genes and adverse pathways associated with the organic components in the fpw samples in addition since the high salinity of fpw could affect the composition of microbial communities and largely impact the effectiveness of fpw treatment technologies zhong et al 2021 accidental spill or direct discharge of treated fpw could cause potential adverse impacts to the receiving waters and local ecosystems which remains a great concern butkovskyi et al 2017 yost et al 2016 several advanced treatment strategies are proposed such as membrane separation thermal distillation adsorption advanced oxidation and biological treatments to remove prioritized organic compounds related to shale gas butkovskyi et al 2017 however a thorough assessment of fpw components including target and non target organic compounds would greatly benefit wastewater treatment design waste management and facilitate the transition towards sustainable uses of fpw such as in irrigation activities zhong et al 2021 3 6 environmental implications shale formations in china are generally more complex than those in north america sun et al 2021a a majority of shale formations in china are organically rich shale which relates to challenges such as extremely high well burial depth undulating surface conditions water shortage and unknown flowback contaminants dong et al 2015 ju et al 2014 leading to profound variations in fpw compositions furthermore the current development of shale gas in china is dominated by the state owned enterprises these entities are not required to release geological information or production data chen et al 2018 and the composition of hf varies by operators which are often kept as trade secrets both difficulties largely inhibit the identification and control of priority pollutants for shale gas exploitation currently the u s epa proposed 1173 hf related chemicals 1076 chemicals used in hfs and 134 chemicals detected in fpw 1026 87 of which lack comprehensive toxicological data yost et al 2016 although previous studies calculated the risk quotients for fpw and sludge through chemical analysis and modeling zhou et al 2022a ecological risks from shale gas exploration and the corresponding priority pollutants remain largely unknown high throughput screening hts data have not yet been widely applied in risk assessment due to the disconnect between endpoints measured in different approaches villeneuve et al 2019 thus our study attempts to link mechanistic level explanations with organism level endpoints to support extrapolation of hts data in future risk assessment for shale gas extraction activities other advanced solutions that integrate tie and effect directed analysis could diagnose toxicants with known and unknown identities in fpw li et al 2018 meanwhile incorporating big data e g gene information in toxicological risk assessments can provide connections between isolated exposure and effect data to identify shale gas related exposure characteristics for ecological risk assessments cheng et al 2020 2022 research also suggests that the way to fulfill the efficiency requirement mainly lies in improving the hf technology regarding water reuse or recycling of the used water during fracturing operations hu and xu 2013 treated fpw could be reused for irrigation livestock watering aquifer recharge or re injection as support water for water conservation however external emission or reuse of treated fpw needs to meet the required standards gb5084 2005 energy industry standards stipulate the internal reuse of fpw and priority control indicators include total salinity total hardness and ph but organic compounds that contributed significantly to toxicity are often ignored sun et al 2021b for decision making voluntary and mandatory measures are required to ensure adequate water allocation and reuse pollutant identification and remediation and efficient wastewater management the proposed tie approach with the confirmation of tissue residues and transcriptomic information presents a promising solution 4 conclusions unknown risks and driven factors dictate hf fpw which largely inhibit sustainable control and management of shale gas production in china our study evaluated the relative toxicity of a series of fpw samples to various freshwater organisms in china based on tie analyses major contaminants salinity particulates and organics were distinguished that trigger fpw toxicity alkanes pahs biocides and surfactants including large molecules were identified in d rerio and g rarus tissues contributing partial toxicity to the overall exposure by connecting mechanistic level explanations with organism level endpoints we were able to extrapolate hts data to confirm major organic contaminants induced toxicity in exposed organisms transcriptome sequencing in exposed d rerio embryos was fused with phenotype databases which served as toxicity confirmation to verify organic induced toxicity and demonstrate the probability of specific organic induced phenotypes in exposed d rerio it should be noted that sewage treatment plants for fpw failed to mitigate adverse outcomes associated with organic contaminants since there is no one size fits all approach for shale gas extraction future theoretical and technological investigations should be highly adaptive to identify and prioritize case specific toxicants during shale gas exploitation 5 supplementary information the

14703,membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr has attracted a lot of attention as an energy efficient integrated nitrogen removing technology in recent years however it is lacking of understanding to realize stable partial nitrification in mabr because of its unique oxygen transfer mode and biofilm structure in this study free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna based control strategies for partial nitrification with low nh4 n concentration were proposed in a mabr of sequencing batch mode the mabr was operated for over 500 days under different influent nh4 n concentrations with the influent nh4 n of around 200 mg n l partial nitrification could be established with relatively low concentration of fa 0 4 2 2 mg n l which suppressed nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob on the biofilm with lower influent nh4 n concentration of around 100 mg n l the fa concentration was lower and strengthened suppression strategies based on fna were needed with the final ph of operating cycles below 5 0 the fna produced in the sequencing batch mabr could stabilize partial nitrification by eliminating nob on the biofilm since the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob was lower without the blow off of dissolved carbon dioxide in the bubbleless mabr longer hydraulic retention time was required to reach a low ph for high concentration of fna to suppress nob after exposures to fna the relative abundance of nitrospira was decreased by 94 6 while the abundance of nitrosospira increased greatly which became another dominant aob genus in addition to nitrosomonas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane aerated biofilm reactor partial nitrification free ammonia free nitrous acid sequencing batch operation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr has received considerable attention as an integrated nitrogen removal technology mabr has two features bubbleless aeration and counter diffusion biofilm li et al 2008 2023 bubbleless aeration leads to much lower energy consumption than traditional aeration methods lu et al 2021 while counter diffusion biofilm enables both aerobic and anoxic zones to exist in mabr these characteristics make mabr a natural fit with partial nitrification anammox pn a process which has been known as the most economical nitrogen removal path therefore researchers have shown an increased interest in the membrane aerated pn a process because of its extremely low energy consumption many studies focused on the feasibility and operating condition of membrane aerated pn a process and the suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob was the key challenge with high influent nh4 n concentrations 200 mg n l gong et al 2007 firstly achieved single stage pn a in the mabr with low air pressure and pellicer nacher et al 2010 proved that intermittent aeration could prevent the increase in nob with lower concentration of influent nh4 n li et al 2016 firstly achieved mainstream membrane aerated pn a process in an upflow mabr with dissolved oxygen do level of 0 6 mg l furthermore bunse et al 2020 achieved mainstream pn a of mabr with real municipal wastewater and claimed that nob could be suppressed by controlling oxygen supply above all controlling do concentration or oxygen supply was the most used method to suppress nob in mabr augusto et al 2018 chen et al 2022 however in mabr nob grow in the inner layer of the biofilm schramm et al 2000 lackner et al 2010 gilmore et al 2013 where the do concentration is usually high as results nob can neither be stably suppressed by limited aeration nor be removed by scouring and an accidental overdose of oxygen could easily lead to the continuous growth of nob which disrupts the pn a process pellicer nacher et al 2010 bunse et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to develop novel strategies to strengthen the nob suppression in mabr free ammonia fa i e nh3 and free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 have been proved to be useful in selecting ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nob in the suspended activated sludge park et al 2010 wang et al 2014 and traditional biofilm systems wang et al 2020 in mabr when intermittent aeration was used by pellicer nacher et al 2010 to establish partial nitrification fa played a major role in nob inhibition which was produced by the periodically change of ph and nh4 n concentrations in the inner layer of biofilm ma et al 2017 chen et al 2022 added 250 mg n l of nh4 n and no2 n to perform temporary fa fna treatments in mabr and succeeded in nob suppression however either high influent nh4 n concentration terada et al 2003 pellicer nacher et al 2010 pourbavarsad et al 2022 or additional chemical agents chen et al 2022 were needed to establish fa fna based partial nitrification in mabr a sequencing batch mabr might be able to provide fa fna suppression on nob in mainstream treatments without additional chemical agents at the beginning of the running cycles high ph and nh4 n concentration lead to high fa concentration during the reaction period alkalinity is consumed by aob when oxidizing ammonia leading to the decrease of ph as a result fna concentration becomes higher in the latter period of cycles with the decrease of ph and accumulation of no2 n sequencing batch reactors sbr have been used in suspended activated sludge process for partial nitrification ren et al 2021 statiris et al 2022 however with the unique aeration system and biofilm structure when mabr is operated in sequencing batch mode the characteristics of ph changes and the contribution of fa and fna on nob suppression should be different from sbr of suspended sludge system which have not been studied this study aims to establish partial nitrification process in a mabr operated in sequencing batch mode with relatively low influent nh4 n of from 200 mg n l to 50 mg n l the operational strategies based on fa and fna were proposed for nob suppression in startup and stable phases with different thresholds of influent nh4 n besides the mechanisms of fa based partial nitrification start up and fna strengthened stable partial nitrification were analyzed the characteristics of ph changes in mabr were also studied for better fa fna inhibition with partial nitrification firstly established in sequencing batch mabr in this study new nitrogen removal processes with high stability and low energy consumption based on the sequencing batch mabr are anticipated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up a zeelung suez water technologies solutions shanghai china lab scale membrane module with a height of 813 mm depth of 112 mm and width of 23 mm was used to deliver oxygen in the mabr fig 1 200 membrane cords with a nominal surface area of 0 25 m2 were used in the module and each cord had an effective length of 570 mm and a media outer diameter of 0 7 mm the effective volume of the reactor was 4 1 l with a height of 900 mm depth of 160 mm and width of 32 mm resulting in a specific membrane surface area of 61 m2 m3 air was supplied to the membrane module in open end mode and the air pressure was around 2 5 kpa intermittent aeration was carried out the lengths of aerated and unaerated periods were both 1 h the mabr was operated in sequencing batch mode synthetic wastewater was fed in at the beginning of each cycle the lengths of filling and withdraw periods were both 10 min settling was not carried out after inoculation sludge was discharged because suspended biomass was not needed in this system the length of reaction period depended on the hydraulic retention time hrt of the reactor the composition of the synthetic wastewater was per liter 191 764 mg of nh4cl i e 50 200 mg nh4 n 40 to 800 mg of

internal recirculation was 60 ml min for better mixing and mass transfer and the temperature was around 25 c under ambient laboratory condition 2 2 operating procedure table 1 summarizes the operating parameters in different phases of this study in phase i day 0 62 the mabr was inoculated with the activated sludge from local municipal waste water treatment plant in china and started with influent nh4 n of 200 mg n l the hrt was 24 h and half of the effluent was let out after 20 min of settling in the decanting procedure to preserve the inoculation sludge suspended sludge was discharged from the reactor at day 37 in phase ii day 63 249 influent nh4 n was reduced to 100 mg n l in phase iii day 250 359 different influent alkalinity concentrations and hrts were studied to explore the range of ph changes during the cycle and the hrt of 48 h was used after phase iii in phase iv day 360 424 sodium nitrite was added to restore partial nitrification and four strategies were implemented 1 120 mg n l of no2 n was added at the 32nd hour of the 48 hour cycles when the ph was around 6 2 200 mg n l of no2 n was added at the beginning of the cycles and ph was adjusted to 5 5 with hydrochloric acid 3 120 mg n l of no2 n was added at the 42nd hour when ph was decreased to 4 7 5 5 while influent alkalinity was decreased gradually from 660 to 494 mg caco3 l to ensure the low ph 4 retention time was prolonged to 72 h after 120 mg n l of no2 n was added at the 42nd hour for longer exposure time of fna all of effluent was decanted in this phase to discharge the added no2 n in phase va day 425 472 the stability of fna strengthened partial nitrification in the sequencing batch mabr were estimated with the influent nh4 n of 100 mg n l influent alkalinity was gradually increased to explore its influence on nitritation effect lower influent nh4 n of 50 mg n l was fed to this system in phase vb day 473 544 and different hrts were investigated 2 3 batch tests and calculation of aob nob activities batch tests were carried out to measure aob and nob activities under different conditions the mabr was filled up with phosphate buffer solution with 30 mg n l of nh4 n and no2 n and operated for 3 h air was supplied continually and the internal recirculation was 150 ml min samples were taken every 20 min for analyzation of ammonia nitrite and nitrate concentrations the average ammonia utilization rate of aob and nitrite utilization rate of nob were calculated by liner regression with least square method maximum activities of aob and nob were calculated according to the

performance of the sequencing batch mabr during day 0 36 almost no no2 n accumulation appeared in the mabr fig 2 the are of the reactor was 58 9 10 5 and the arr was 114 5 19 8 mg n l d fig s2 i e 1 88 0 32 g n m2 d comparable to other reports bunse et al 2020 after discharging the suspended sludge no2 n concentration increased and nar reached 92 9 7 2 during day 37 62 indicating a successful startup of partial nitrification on the biofilm of mabr during which fa played an important role the fa based startup of partial nitrification is discussed in section 3 2 in phase ii when the influent nh4 n was decreased to 100 mg n l nar started to decreased gradually and reached 0 full nitrification occurred in the mabr after day 220 intermittent aeration failed to suppress nob in this phase the reason might be that the concentration of nh4 n was much lower than that in the study of pellicer nacher et al 2010 and intermittent aeration could not produce periodically high concentration of fa for the suppression of nob therefore strengthening methods should be taken to stabilize partial nitrification under the influent nh4 n of 100 mg n l in phase iii low influent alkalinity and long hrt were used to realize low ph for high concentration of fna in phase iiia low influent alkalinity could not decrease the final ph of operating cycles while in phase iiic when hrt was prolonged to 48 h the final ph was reduced to 4 5 the characteristics of ph changes in the sequencing batch mabr is discussed in section 3 4 in phase iv as sodium nitrite was added to suppress nob with fna partial nitrification was restored and nar reached 79 2 at the end of this phase in phase va fna strengthened stable partial nitrification was achieved in the sequencing batch mabr under the influent nh4 n of 100 mg n l without additional chemical agents achieving are of 78 4 and nar of 81 7 the influence of influent alkalinity on nitritation was investigated fig s3 and the optimal influent alkalinity was 613 637 mg caco3 l lower influent alkalinity led to lower are while higher influent alkalinity led to higher final ph which was unfavorable for nob suppression the fna strengthened partial nitrification is discussed in section 3 3 in phase vb when the influent nh4 n concentration was reduced to 50 mg n l and hrt was shorten to 24 h the nar remained at 81 0 however the final ph could only reach 6 25 due to the insufficient retention time which was unfavorable for the long term nob control after hrt was changed back to 48 h the final ph reached 5 07 but the nar gradually decreased from 81 7 on day 484 to 51 2 on day 544 because of the lower fna concentration and excessive oxygen supply therefore lower final ph should be achieved with shorter hrt to establish fna based stable partial nitrification in the sequencing batch mabr under the influent nh4 n of 50 mg n l 3 2 fa based startup of partial nitrification in phase i when influent nh4 n was 200 mg n l partial nitrification was established after suspended sludge was discharged on day 36 batch tests revealed that nob mainly existed in suspended sludge on day 32 while nob activity on the biofilm was negligible fig 3 partial nitrification was stabilized for 4 weeks and nob activity was still not detected on the biofilm on day 58 indicating that the growth of nob on the biofilm was successfully suppressed in the sequencing batch mabr considering that oxygen supply was not controlled with the open end aeration mode and the do concentration was over 0 5 mg l during phase i fa inhibition could be the major cause for the nob suppression in phase i the fa concentration decreased from 2 2 to 0 4 mg n l through the sbr cycles which was higher than the inhibition threshold of nob activity 0 04 0 85 mg n l ushiki et al 2017 however in suspended activated sludge systems continuous high fa concentration above 2 mg n l are required for the washout of nob park et al 2010 in sequencing batch reactors of suspended activated sludge system higher fa concentration up to 18 mg n l was used for the inhibition of nob sun et al 2015 in this study the average fa concentration was only 1 3 mg n l lower than that used in the activated sludge nitritation processes considering that nob activity was not effectively suppressed in the sludge but successfully inhibited on the biofilm during day 0 36 it could be speculated that lower fa concentration was needed to suppress nob on the biofilms in phase ii when the influent nh4 n was decreased to 100 mg n l nob began to grow on the biofilm and attained higher activity than aob on day 243 leading to full nitrification in this phase the average fa concentration could only reach 0 37 mg n l due to the lower influent nh4 n concentration and lower ph the fa inhibition was greatly weakened and failed to suppress nob above all with a moderate influent alkalinity and no ph adjustment method the fa based nob suppression strategy could establish partial nitrification process in the sequencing batch mabr fed with nh4 n of over 200 mg n l but failed with nh4 n below 100 mg n l to understand the mechanism of fa based startup of partial nitrification on the biofilm kinetic characteristics of aob and nob were compared although aob and nob have similar minimum doubling time the yield coefficient of aob is 3 4 times higher than nob hiatt grady 2008 park et al 2015 therefore when the total substrate utilization rates of aob and nob were equal during the inoculation stage the growth rate of aob was much higher than that of nob the lower growth rate of nob led to poor biofilm formation of them after the discharge of inoculation sludge nitrite was sufficient for the growth of nob but fa suppressed the nob activity by 87 calculated by eq 2 and prolonged the doubling time of nob from their minimum doubling time of 0 7 days park et al 2015 to longer than 5 4 days this doubling time was not long enough for the washout of nob in suspended activated sludge systems because the sludge retention time srt was usually over 10 days kouba et al 2017 laureni et al 2019 however in the sequencing batch mabr the srt of suspended sludge was only 1 day because of the decanting procedures of sbr therefore nob would be washed out before they formed firm connections with the biofilm when the influent nh4 n was decreased to 100 mg n l the fa concentration was lower and the doubling time of nob was about 1 7 days indicating that nob might form biofilm if they could attach to the biofilm and survive several decanting procedures above all partial nitrification could be established with relatively low fa concentration of 0 4 2 2 mg n l in the sequencing batch mabr 3 3 fna strengthened partial nitrification with lower ammonia feed once nob started to grow on the biofilm fa or low do concentration could only decelerate the growth of nob but could not remove them from the biofilm therefore strengthening methods based on fna were used to eliminate nob in phase iv and v at the end of phase iii the activity of nob had been much higher than aob fig 4 therefore external no2 n was added for the elimination of nob in phase iv and four strategies were implemented fig s4 the first strategy added no2 n too early and could not achieve low ph the second strategy adjusted ph by manually adding hydrochloric acid but the volatilization of hydrochloric acid decreased the fna concentration from 4 0 mg n l to 0 14 mg n l fig s5 and the elimination of nob was not obvious with the average fna concentration of 0 95 mg n and exposure time of 24 h in the last two strategies the ph was reduced to 5 5 by nitrification before no2 n was added and a stable fna concentration of over 2 mg n l was realized exposure time of 6 h per cycle did not achieve partial nitrification while 30 h of fna exposure got quick results of nob suppression above all when fna was used for the elimination of nob both sufficient fna concentration and fna exposure time were required moreover a high fna concentration was established on a stable low ph condition and high no2 n concentration in this study long exposure time with fna concentration lower than 1 mg n l or high fna concentration with exposure time less than 6 h was not able to eliminate the great number of nob on the biofilm while an exposure time of 30 h with 2 mg n l of fna succeeded to start partial nitrification from a full nitrification process in phase v the fna strengthened stable partial nitrification was established in the sequencing batch mabr nar reached 81 7 and the no3 n concentration of effluent stabilized at 14 08 2 46 mg n l the concentration of fna was over 1 mg n l in the last 8 h of cycles fig s6 which might be the main reason for the suppression of nob when the concentration of influent nh4 n was reduced to 50 mg n l the concentration of fna was decreased by half which failed to suppress nob in the long term operation to interpret the mechanism of fna strengthened partial nitrification in phase iv and v the influences of fna on aob and nob were summarized as inhibition effect and elimination effect when the fna concentration is over 0 42 1 72 mg n l and 0 026 0 22 mg n l the activity of aob and nob will be temporarily inhibited respectively zhou et al 2011 when the fna concentration is much higher aob and nob could be eliminated the inhibition effect of fna on aob and nob could be calculated by deducting their observed average activities from their maximum activities if other inhibiting factors are negligible while the elimination effect appears as the decrease of their relative abundances or maximum activities in phase iv the elimination effect of fna played a major role and decreased the maximum activity of nob by 89 while the activity of aob was only decreased by 23 fig 4 in phase va the joint effect of fa and fna inhibited the activity of aob and nob by 65 and 87 respectively fig 4 which helped to stabilize the partial nitrification process the yield rate of nob was decreased from 1 44 1 d park et al 2015 to about 0 19 1 d which was still higher than its endogenous respiration rate 0 073 1 d hao et al 2002 therefore the elimination effect of fna played an important role in phase va which counteracted the growth of nob as a result the activity of nob did not increase from day 428 to 468 corresponding to the stable effluent no3 n concentration when the concentration of influent nh4 n was reduced to 50 mg n l fna inhibition was attenuated resulting in the reduction of nar meanwhile the lower fna concentration could not eliminate nob leading to the increase of nob activity in the long term operation in conclusion partial nitrification could be established from full nitrification by adding nitrite and stabilized by sequencing batch operation without additional chemicals in the sequencing batch mabr with influent nh4 n of 100 mg n l and the fna concentration required for the elimination of nob was over 1 mg n l 3 4 characteristics of ph changes in sequencing batch mabr to reach higher concentrations of fna for better nob suppression the final ph should be low in the sequencing batch mabr the range of ph changes during the cycles was explored in phase iii table 2 and the strategies of lower influent alkalinity and longer hrt were used to adjust ph when the influent alkalinity was reduced from 660 to 380 mg caco3 l in phase iiia the initial ph was reduced from 7 26 to 6 65 and the arr was decreased to by 60 7 this decrease of arr could be ascribed to two effects of ph on one hand the lower ph reduced the concentration of fa as the substrate of aob i e substrate effect on the other hand the lower ph could also reduce the activity of aob through its effect on enzymes i e enzyme effect ma et al 2017 according to the results of van hulle et al 2007 the activity of aob was decreased by 34 7 when ph was reduced from 7 23 to 6 5 in the activated sludge system in this study the effect of ph seemed to be stronger the reason might be that the actual ph of inner layers of biofilm was even lower than the ph of bulk solution due to the mass transfer resistance of the biofilm and its boundary layer because of the poor aob activity the lower influent alkalinity could not decrease the final ph however even with higher influent alkalinity aob activity would also be inhibited when ph was decreased to 6 0 6 5 with the inhibited substrate utilization rate hrt longer than 36 h was needed to reduce the ph to 5 0 fig 5 a and a hrt of 48 h was applied to ensure the exposure time of fna it is worth to mention that in bubbled aeration system high aob activity and low final ph could both be realized the ph changes of a sequencing batch moving bed biofilm reactor with similar influent alkalinity influent nh4 n concentration and arr to the mabr were investigated fig 5b in this bubbled aeration system ph could decrease to 4 5 within 12 h while more than 18 h was needed in mabr this could be explained by the blow off of dissolved carbon dioxide and the buffering effect of hco3 and co3 2 according to eq 8 8 k a 1 s h s hco 3 s h 2 c o 3 where k a1 is the dissociation equilibrium constant of carbonic acid 4 30 10 7 mol l 25 c 1 atm s h s hco 3 and s h 2 c o 3 are the concentrations of proton bicarbonate and the sum of carbon dioxide and carbonic acid mol l in bubbled aeration system carbon dioxide could be blown off from the solution and s h 2 c o 3 would be very low which was slightly higher than the equilibrium concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolved in the water taking it 3 10 5 mol l when 90 of influent alkalinity was consumed s hco 3 would be 6 6 10 4 mol l and ph would be 7 71 according to eq 8 indicating that most of alkalinity could be consumed when ph was above 7 71 and aob activity was high as a result high average arr could be achieved in bubbled aeration system however in mabr carbon dioxide released slowly through the aeration membrane and air water interface while most of it remained in the solution with the consumption of alkalinity s h 2 c o 3 became higher in the mabr and ph would gradually decrease assuming that 50 of carbon dioxide remained in the solution when 90 of influent alkalinity was consumed s h 2 c o 3 would be 3 0 10 3 mol l and ph would be 5 71 greatly lower than the bubbled aeration system as a result the activity of aob was continuously decreased during the sbr cycles and longer hrt was required to lower the ph leading to the low arr however in practical process stirring or bubble aeration is usually required to control the thickness of biofilm stricker et al 2011 côté et al 2015 syron et al 2015 and higher arr could be realized in that case with intermittent bubble aeration added in the sequencing batch mabr lower ph could be reached with shorter hrt and fna strengthened partial nitrification could be established under the influent nh4 n of lower than 100 mg n l although the bubbleless aeration of mabr affected the activity of aob the counter diffusion biofilm also had some advantages for maintaining the arr at low ph when ph decreased during the cycles the aob activity as well as the oxygen utilization rate also decreased and oxygen could transfer deeper through the biofilm thus increasing the thickness of aerobic layer in the biofilm and enabling the aob of the outer layer participate in the oxidizing of ammonia which made up for the inhibition of low ph the long term influence of periodic ph changes on aob activity was also investigated by comparing the aob activities before and after stage iii fig s7 it can be seen that although the final ph decreased from 6 7 to around 4 the average aob activity consistently remained around 120 mg n l d according to claros et al 2013 in a system with low ph of 6 2 the maximum activity of aob was decreased by more than 60 compared to that when ph was 6 6 however no similar results was observed in this study implying that the intermittent low ph did not suppress the aob community 3 5 nitrifying microbial community after exposure to fna 16s rdna high throughput sequencing was used to analyze the microbial community structure of seeding sludge and mabr biofilms from day 331 before fna inhibition day 428 early stage when partial nitrification was established 468 days 7 weeks after partial nitrification was established fig 6 at the phylum level proteobacteria accounted for 44 7 66 8 as the most dominant phylum in the biofilm community structure xu et al 2018 followed by bacteroidetes which accounted for 23 2 32 4 the percentage of acidobacteria decreased from 6 8 to 0 63 after exposure to fna indicating that this phylum of bacteria could not adapt to fna nitrospirae which mainly included the nob genus nitrospira and accounted for only 0 27 in the seeding sludge was enriched to 10 3 in the biofilm on day 334 then decreased to 3 1 after phase iv and further decreased to 0 57 after 7 weeks of sequencing batch operation in phase va actinobacteria increased from 1 6 to 9 1 after exposure to fna which might have some resistance to fna due to its thicker cell wall at the genus level the dominant bacterial groups in the biofilm included nitrosomonas nitrosospira nitrospira chujaibacter and rhodanobacter under the order of xanthomonadales as well as uncultured genera under the families of chitinophagaceae and microscillaceae the relative abundance of nitrification related bacteria genera showed obvious changes after exposure to fna the nob genus nitrospira decreased from 10 3 to 3 1 and further decreased to 0 56 after 7 weeks of fna strengthened operation confirming that fna eliminated nitrospira in both phase iv and phase va however since the effluent no3 n concentration did not decrease during the 7 weeks of phase va the residual nob might have higher specific activity and better adaptation to fna the aob genus nitrosomonas increased from 5 9 to 14 8 indicating that fna did not reduced their number the increase of nitrosospira from less than 0 1 to 5 5 might be due to their stronger adaptation to high fna concentration and low substrate concentration dytczak et al 2008 cua stein 2011 the increase of nitrosospira was also beneficial for the arr of the reactor at low ph li et al 2020 certain species under the genus comamonas also have functions of partial nitrification and denitrification patureau et al 1997 and the relative abundance of this genus increased from 1 1 to 6 4 after exposure to fna the anammox bacterium candidatus brocadia accounted for 1 4 of the biofilm on day 468 illustrating that the sequencing batch mabr had a suitable environment for the growth of anammox bacteria and that anammox deammonification pathways might have existed in the mabr 4 conclusions in this study partial nitrification was established in a sequencing batch mabr the following conclusions are summarized 1 the fa and fna based strategies were proposed to establish partial nitrification in the sequencing batch mabr the fa based strategy could establish partial nitrification with the influent nh4 n over 200 mg n l and the fna based strategy could stabilize partial nitrification with influent nh4 n over 100 mg n l without additional chemicals 2 the sequencing batch operation was critical in the fa and fna based strategies in the fa based strategy the sequencing batch mode enabled high fa concentration at the beginning of each operating cycle in the fna based strategy the sequencing batch operation could maintain higher average activity of aob than continuous operating mode which enabled lower final ph for nob suppression by fna 2 the elimination effect of fna on nob was observed in the fna based strategy which solved the problem that nob could not be washed out from the mabr biofilm and strengthened the stability of partial nitrification process in mabr 3 the elimination effect of fna on nob was observed in the fna based strategy which solved the problem that nob could not be washed out from the mabr biofilm and strengthened the stability of partial nitrification process in mabr 4 bubbleless aeration of mabr limited the blow off of carbon dioxide and further inhibited the activity of aob by affecting the equilibrium range of ph in practical applications intermittent bubble aeration should be added to blow off the carbon dioxide for higher aob activity and shorter hrt while controlling the biofilm thickness declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

14703,membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr has attracted a lot of attention as an energy efficient integrated nitrogen removing technology in recent years however it is lacking of understanding to realize stable partial nitrification in mabr because of its unique oxygen transfer mode and biofilm structure in this study free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna based control strategies for partial nitrification with low nh4 n concentration were proposed in a mabr of sequencing batch mode the mabr was operated for over 500 days under different influent nh4 n concentrations with the influent nh4 n of around 200 mg n l partial nitrification could be established with relatively low concentration of fa 0 4 2 2 mg n l which suppressed nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob on the biofilm with lower influent nh4 n concentration of around 100 mg n l the fa concentration was lower and strengthened suppression strategies based on fna were needed with the final ph of operating cycles below 5 0 the fna produced in the sequencing batch mabr could stabilize partial nitrification by eliminating nob on the biofilm since the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob was lower without the blow off of dissolved carbon dioxide in the bubbleless mabr longer hydraulic retention time was required to reach a low ph for high concentration of fna to suppress nob after exposures to fna the relative abundance of nitrospira was decreased by 94 6 while the abundance of nitrosospira increased greatly which became another dominant aob genus in addition to nitrosomonas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane aerated biofilm reactor partial nitrification free ammonia free nitrous acid sequencing batch operation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr has received considerable attention as an integrated nitrogen removal technology mabr has two features bubbleless aeration and counter diffusion biofilm li et al 2008 2023 bubbleless aeration leads to much lower energy consumption than traditional aeration methods lu et al 2021 while counter diffusion biofilm enables both aerobic and anoxic zones to exist in mabr these characteristics make mabr a natural fit with partial nitrification anammox pn a process which has been known as the most economical nitrogen removal path therefore researchers have shown an increased interest in the membrane aerated pn a process because of its extremely low energy consumption many studies focused on the feasibility and operating condition of membrane aerated pn a process and the suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob was the key challenge with high influent nh4 n concentrations 200 mg n l gong et al 2007 firstly achieved single stage pn a in the mabr with low air pressure and pellicer nacher et al 2010 proved that intermittent aeration could prevent the increase in nob with lower concentration of influent nh4 n li et al 2016 firstly achieved mainstream membrane aerated pn a process in an upflow mabr with dissolved oxygen do level of 0 6 mg l furthermore bunse et al 2020 achieved mainstream pn a of mabr with real municipal wastewater and claimed that nob could be suppressed by controlling oxygen supply above all controlling do concentration or oxygen supply was the most used method to suppress nob in mabr augusto et al 2018 chen et al 2022 however in mabr nob grow in the inner layer of the biofilm schramm et al 2000 lackner et al 2010 gilmore et al 2013 where the do concentration is usually high as results nob can neither be stably suppressed by limited aeration nor be removed by scouring and an accidental overdose of oxygen could easily lead to the continuous growth of nob which disrupts the pn a process pellicer nacher et al 2010 bunse et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to develop novel strategies to strengthen the nob suppression in mabr free ammonia fa i e nh3 and free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 have been proved to be useful in selecting ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nob in the suspended activated sludge park et al 2010 wang et al 2014 and traditional biofilm systems wang et al 2020 in mabr when intermittent aeration was used by pellicer nacher et al 2010 to establish partial nitrification fa played a major role in nob inhibition which was produced by the periodically change of ph and nh4 n concentrations in the inner layer of biofilm ma et al 2017 chen et al 2022 added 250 mg n l of nh4 n and no2 n to perform temporary fa fna treatments in mabr and succeeded in nob suppression however either high influent nh4 n concentration terada et al 2003 pellicer nacher et al 2010 pourbavarsad et al 2022 or additional chemical agents chen et al 2022 were needed to establish fa fna based partial nitrification in mabr a sequencing batch mabr might be able to provide fa fna suppression on nob in mainstream treatments without additional chemical agents at the beginning of the running cycles high ph and nh4 n concentration lead to high fa concentration during the reaction period alkalinity is consumed by aob when oxidizing ammonia leading to the decrease of ph as a result fna concentration becomes higher in the latter period of cycles with the decrease of ph and accumulation of no2 n sequencing batch reactors sbr have been used in suspended activated sludge process for partial nitrification ren et al 2021 statiris et al 2022 however with the unique aeration system and biofilm structure when mabr is operated in sequencing batch mode the characteristics of ph changes and the contribution of fa and fna on nob suppression should be different from sbr of suspended sludge system which have not been studied this study aims to establish partial nitrification process in a mabr operated in sequencing batch mode with relatively low influent nh4 n of from 200 mg n l to 50 mg n l the operational strategies based on fa and fna were proposed for nob suppression in startup and stable phases with different thresholds of influent nh4 n besides the mechanisms of fa based partial nitrification start up and fna strengthened stable partial nitrification were analyzed the characteristics of ph changes in mabr were also studied for better fa fna inhibition with partial nitrification firstly established in sequencing batch mabr in this study new nitrogen removal processes with high stability and low energy consumption based on the sequencing batch mabr are anticipated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up a zeelung suez water technologies solutions shanghai china lab scale membrane module with a height of 813 mm depth of 112 mm and width of 23 mm was used to deliver oxygen in the mabr fig 1 200 membrane cords with a nominal surface area of 0 25 m2 were used in the module and each cord had an effective length of 570 mm and a media outer diameter of 0 7 mm the effective volume of the reactor was 4 1 l with a height of 900 mm depth of 160 mm and width of 32 mm resulting in a specific membrane surface area of 61 m2 m3 air was supplied to the membrane module in open end mode and the air pressure was around 2 5 kpa intermittent aeration was carried out the lengths of aerated and unaerated periods were both 1 h the mabr was operated in sequencing batch mode synthetic wastewater was fed in at the beginning of each cycle the lengths of filling and withdraw periods were both 10 min settling was not carried out after inoculation sludge was discharged because suspended biomass was not needed in this system the length of reaction period depended on the hydraulic retention time hrt of the reactor the composition of the synthetic wastewater was per liter 191 764 mg of nh4cl i e 50 200 mg nh4 n 40 to 800 mg of

internal recirculation was 60 ml min for better mixing and mass transfer and the temperature was around 25 c under ambient laboratory condition 2 2 operating procedure table 1 summarizes the operating parameters in different phases of this study in phase i day 0 62 the mabr was inoculated with the activated sludge from local municipal waste water treatment plant in china and started with influent nh4 n of 200 mg n l the hrt was 24 h and half of the effluent was let out after 20 min of settling in the decanting procedure to preserve the inoculation sludge suspended sludge was discharged from the reactor at day 37 in phase ii day 63 249 influent nh4 n was reduced to 100 mg n l in phase iii day 250 359 different influent alkalinity concentrations and hrts were studied to explore the range of ph changes during the cycle and the hrt of 48 h was used after phase iii in phase iv day 360 424 sodium nitrite was added to restore partial nitrification and four strategies were implemented 1 120 mg n l of no2 n was added at the 32nd hour of the 48 hour cycles when the ph was around 6 2 200 mg n l of no2 n was added at the beginning of the cycles and ph was adjusted to 5 5 with hydrochloric acid 3 120 mg n l of no2 n was added at the 42nd hour when ph was decreased to 4 7 5 5 while influent alkalinity was decreased gradually from 660 to 494 mg caco3 l to ensure the low ph 4 retention time was prolonged to 72 h after 120 mg n l of no2 n was added at the 42nd hour for longer exposure time of fna all of effluent was decanted in this phase to discharge the added no2 n in phase va day 425 472 the stability of fna strengthened partial nitrification in the sequencing batch mabr were estimated with the influent nh4 n of 100 mg n l influent alkalinity was gradually increased to explore its influence on nitritation effect lower influent nh4 n of 50 mg n l was fed to this system in phase vb day 473 544 and different hrts were investigated 2 3 batch tests and calculation of aob nob activities batch tests were carried out to measure aob and nob activities under different conditions the mabr was filled up with phosphate buffer solution with 30 mg n l of nh4 n and no2 n and operated for 3 h air was supplied continually and the internal recirculation was 150 ml min samples were taken every 20 min for analyzation of ammonia nitrite and nitrate concentrations the average ammonia utilization rate of aob and nitrite utilization rate of nob were calculated by liner regression with least square method maximum activities of aob and nob were calculated according to the

performance of the sequencing batch mabr during day 0 36 almost no no2 n accumulation appeared in the mabr fig 2 the are of the reactor was 58 9 10 5 and the arr was 114 5 19 8 mg n l d fig s2 i e 1 88 0 32 g n m2 d comparable to other reports bunse et al 2020 after discharging the suspended sludge no2 n concentration increased and nar reached 92 9 7 2 during day 37 62 indicating a successful startup of partial nitrification on the biofilm of mabr during which fa played an important role the fa based startup of partial nitrification is discussed in section 3 2 in phase ii when the influent nh4 n was decreased to 100 mg n l nar started to decreased gradually and reached 0 full nitrification occurred in the mabr after day 220 intermittent aeration failed to suppress nob in this phase the reason might be that the concentration of nh4 n was much lower than that in the study of pellicer nacher et al 2010 and intermittent aeration could not produce periodically high concentration of fa for the suppression of nob therefore strengthening methods should be taken to stabilize partial nitrification under the influent nh4 n of 100 mg n l in phase iii low influent alkalinity and long hrt were used to realize low ph for high concentration of fna in phase iiia low influent alkalinity could not decrease the final ph of operating cycles while in phase iiic when hrt was prolonged to 48 h the final ph was reduced to 4 5 the characteristics of ph changes in the sequencing batch mabr is discussed in section 3 4 in phase iv as sodium nitrite was added to suppress nob with fna partial nitrification was restored and nar reached 79 2 at the end of this phase in phase va fna strengthened stable partial nitrification was achieved in the sequencing batch mabr under the influent nh4 n of 100 mg n l without additional chemical agents achieving are of 78 4 and nar of 81 7 the influence of influent alkalinity on nitritation was investigated fig s3 and the optimal influent alkalinity was 613 637 mg caco3 l lower influent alkalinity led to lower are while higher influent alkalinity led to higher final ph which was unfavorable for nob suppression the fna strengthened partial nitrification is discussed in section 3 3 in phase vb when the influent nh4 n concentration was reduced to 50 mg n l and hrt was shorten to 24 h the nar remained at 81 0 however the final ph could only reach 6 25 due to the insufficient retention time which was unfavorable for the long term nob control after hrt was changed back to 48 h the final ph reached 5 07 but the nar gradually decreased from 81 7 on day 484 to 51 2 on day 544 because of the lower fna concentration and excessive oxygen supply therefore lower final ph should be achieved with shorter hrt to establish fna based stable partial nitrification in the sequencing batch mabr under the influent nh4 n of 50 mg n l 3 2 fa based startup of partial nitrification in phase i when influent nh4 n was 200 mg n l partial nitrification was established after suspended sludge was discharged on day 36 batch tests revealed that nob mainly existed in suspended sludge on day 32 while nob activity on the biofilm was negligible fig 3 partial nitrification was stabilized for 4 weeks and nob activity was still not detected on the biofilm on day 58 indicating that the growth of nob on the biofilm was successfully suppressed in the sequencing batch mabr considering that oxygen supply was not controlled with the open end aeration mode and the do concentration was over 0 5 mg l during phase i fa inhibition could be the major cause for the nob suppression in phase i the fa concentration decreased from 2 2 to 0 4 mg n l through the sbr cycles which was higher than the inhibition threshold of nob activity 0 04 0 85 mg n l ushiki et al 2017 however in suspended activated sludge systems continuous high fa concentration above 2 mg n l are required for the washout of nob park et al 2010 in sequencing batch reactors of suspended activated sludge system higher fa concentration up to 18 mg n l was used for the inhibition of nob sun et al 2015 in this study the average fa concentration was only 1 3 mg n l lower than that used in the activated sludge nitritation processes considering that nob activity was not effectively suppressed in the sludge but successfully inhibited on the biofilm during day 0 36 it could be speculated that lower fa concentration was needed to suppress nob on the biofilms in phase ii when the influent nh4 n was decreased to 100 mg n l nob began to grow on the biofilm and attained higher activity than aob on day 243 leading to full nitrification in this phase the average fa concentration could only reach 0 37 mg n l due to the lower influent nh4 n concentration and lower ph the fa inhibition was greatly weakened and failed to suppress nob above all with a moderate influent alkalinity and no ph adjustment method the fa based nob suppression strategy could establish partial nitrification process in the sequencing batch mabr fed with nh4 n of over 200 mg n l but failed with nh4 n below 100 mg n l to understand the mechanism of fa based startup of partial nitrification on the biofilm kinetic characteristics of aob and nob were compared although aob and nob have similar minimum doubling time the yield coefficient of aob is 3 4 times higher than nob hiatt grady 2008 park et al 2015 therefore when the total substrate utilization rates of aob and nob were equal during the inoculation stage the growth rate of aob was much higher than that of nob the lower growth rate of nob led to poor biofilm formation of them after the discharge of inoculation sludge nitrite was sufficient for the growth of nob but fa suppressed the nob activity by 87 calculated by eq 2 and prolonged the doubling time of nob from their minimum doubling time of 0 7 days park et al 2015 to longer than 5 4 days this doubling time was not long enough for the washout of nob in suspended activated sludge systems because the sludge retention time srt was usually over 10 days kouba et al 2017 laureni et al 2019 however in the sequencing batch mabr the srt of suspended sludge was only 1 day because of the decanting procedures of sbr therefore nob would be washed out before they formed firm connections with the biofilm when the influent nh4 n was decreased to 100 mg n l the fa concentration was lower and the doubling time of nob was about 1 7 days indicating that nob might form biofilm if they could attach to the biofilm and survive several decanting procedures above all partial nitrification could be established with relatively low fa concentration of 0 4 2 2 mg n l in the sequencing batch mabr 3 3 fna strengthened partial nitrification with lower ammonia feed once nob started to grow on the biofilm fa or low do concentration could only decelerate the growth of nob but could not remove them from the biofilm therefore strengthening methods based on fna were used to eliminate nob in phase iv and v at the end of phase iii the activity of nob had been much higher than aob fig 4 therefore external no2 n was added for the elimination of nob in phase iv and four strategies were implemented fig s4 the first strategy added no2 n too early and could not achieve low ph the second strategy adjusted ph by manually adding hydrochloric acid but the volatilization of hydrochloric acid decreased the fna concentration from 4 0 mg n l to 0 14 mg n l fig s5 and the elimination of nob was not obvious with the average fna concentration of 0 95 mg n and exposure time of 24 h in the last two strategies the ph was reduced to 5 5 by nitrification before no2 n was added and a stable fna concentration of over 2 mg n l was realized exposure time of 6 h per cycle did not achieve partial nitrification while 30 h of fna exposure got quick results of nob suppression above all when fna was used for the elimination of nob both sufficient fna concentration and fna exposure time were required moreover a high fna concentration was established on a stable low ph condition and high no2 n concentration in this study long exposure time with fna concentration lower than 1 mg n l or high fna concentration with exposure time less than 6 h was not able to eliminate the great number of nob on the biofilm while an exposure time of 30 h with 2 mg n l of fna succeeded to start partial nitrification from a full nitrification process in phase v the fna strengthened stable partial nitrification was established in the sequencing batch mabr nar reached 81 7 and the no3 n concentration of effluent stabilized at 14 08 2 46 mg n l the concentration of fna was over 1 mg n l in the last 8 h of cycles fig s6 which might be the main reason for the suppression of nob when the concentration of influent nh4 n was reduced to 50 mg n l the concentration of fna was decreased by half which failed to suppress nob in the long term operation to interpret the mechanism of fna strengthened partial nitrification in phase iv and v the influences of fna on aob and nob were summarized as inhibition effect and elimination effect when the fna concentration is over 0 42 1 72 mg n l and 0 026 0 22 mg n l the activity of aob and nob will be temporarily inhibited respectively zhou et al 2011 when the fna concentration is much higher aob and nob could be eliminated the inhibition effect of fna on aob and nob could be calculated by deducting their observed average activities from their maximum activities if other inhibiting factors are negligible while the elimination effect appears as the decrease of their relative abundances or maximum activities in phase iv the elimination effect of fna played a major role and decreased the maximum activity of nob by 89 while the activity of aob was only decreased by 23 fig 4 in phase va the joint effect of fa and fna inhibited the activity of aob and nob by 65 and 87 respectively fig 4 which helped to stabilize the partial nitrification process the yield rate of nob was decreased from 1 44 1 d park et al 2015 to about 0 19 1 d which was still higher than its endogenous respiration rate 0 073 1 d hao et al 2002 therefore the elimination effect of fna played an important role in phase va which counteracted the growth of nob as a result the activity of nob did not increase from day 428 to 468 corresponding to the stable effluent no3 n concentration when the concentration of influent nh4 n was reduced to 50 mg n l fna inhibition was attenuated resulting in the reduction of nar meanwhile the lower fna concentration could not eliminate nob leading to the increase of nob activity in the long term operation in conclusion partial nitrification could be established from full nitrification by adding nitrite and stabilized by sequencing batch operation without additional chemicals in the sequencing batch mabr with influent nh4 n of 100 mg n l and the fna concentration required for the elimination of nob was over 1 mg n l 3 4 characteristics of ph changes in sequencing batch mabr to reach higher concentrations of fna for better nob suppression the final ph should be low in the sequencing batch mabr the range of ph changes during the cycles was explored in phase iii table 2 and the strategies of lower influent alkalinity and longer hrt were used to adjust ph when the influent alkalinity was reduced from 660 to 380 mg caco3 l in phase iiia the initial ph was reduced from 7 26 to 6 65 and the arr was decreased to by 60 7 this decrease of arr could be ascribed to two effects of ph on one hand the lower ph reduced the concentration of fa as the substrate of aob i e substrate effect on the other hand the lower ph could also reduce the activity of aob through its effect on enzymes i e enzyme effect ma et al 2017 according to the results of van hulle et al 2007 the activity of aob was decreased by 34 7 when ph was reduced from 7 23 to 6 5 in the activated sludge system in this study the effect of ph seemed to be stronger the reason might be that the actual ph of inner layers of biofilm was even lower than the ph of bulk solution due to the mass transfer resistance of the biofilm and its boundary layer because of the poor aob activity the lower influent alkalinity could not decrease the final ph however even with higher influent alkalinity aob activity would also be inhibited when ph was decreased to 6 0 6 5 with the inhibited substrate utilization rate hrt longer than 36 h was needed to reduce the ph to 5 0 fig 5 a and a hrt of 48 h was applied to ensure the exposure time of fna it is worth to mention that in bubbled aeration system high aob activity and low final ph could both be realized the ph changes of a sequencing batch moving bed biofilm reactor with similar influent alkalinity influent nh4 n concentration and arr to the mabr were investigated fig 5b in this bubbled aeration system ph could decrease to 4 5 within 12 h while more than 18 h was needed in mabr this could be explained by the blow off of dissolved carbon dioxide and the buffering effect of hco3 and co3 2 according to eq 8 8 k a 1 s h s hco 3 s h 2 c o 3 where k a1 is the dissociation equilibrium constant of carbonic acid 4 30 10 7 mol l 25 c 1 atm s h s hco 3 and s h 2 c o 3 are the concentrations of proton bicarbonate and the sum of carbon dioxide and carbonic acid mol l in bubbled aeration system carbon dioxide could be blown off from the solution and s h 2 c o 3 would be very low which was slightly higher than the equilibrium concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolved in the water taking it 3 10 5 mol l when 90 of influent alkalinity was consumed s hco 3 would be 6 6 10 4 mol l and ph would be 7 71 according to eq 8 indicating that most of alkalinity could be consumed when ph was above 7 71 and aob activity was high as a result high average arr could be achieved in bubbled aeration system however in mabr carbon dioxide released slowly through the aeration membrane and air water interface while most of it remained in the solution with the consumption of alkalinity s h 2 c o 3 became higher in the mabr and ph would gradually decrease assuming that 50 of carbon dioxide remained in the solution when 90 of influent alkalinity was consumed s h 2 c o 3 would be 3 0 10 3 mol l and ph would be 5 71 greatly lower than the bubbled aeration system as a result the activity of aob was continuously decreased during the sbr cycles and longer hrt was required to lower the ph leading to the low arr however in practical process stirring or bubble aeration is usually required to control the thickness of biofilm stricker et al 2011 côté et al 2015 syron et al 2015 and higher arr could be realized in that case with intermittent bubble aeration added in the sequencing batch mabr lower ph could be reached with shorter hrt and fna strengthened partial nitrification could be established under the influent nh4 n of lower than 100 mg n l although the bubbleless aeration of mabr affected the activity of aob the counter diffusion biofilm also had some advantages for maintaining the arr at low ph when ph decreased during the cycles the aob activity as well as the oxygen utilization rate also decreased and oxygen could transfer deeper through the biofilm thus increasing the thickness of aerobic layer in the biofilm and enabling the aob of the outer layer participate in the oxidizing of ammonia which made up for the inhibition of low ph the long term influence of periodic ph changes on aob activity was also investigated by comparing the aob activities before and after stage iii fig s7 it can be seen that although the final ph decreased from 6 7 to around 4 the average aob activity consistently remained around 120 mg n l d according to claros et al 2013 in a system with low ph of 6 2 the maximum activity of aob was decreased by more than 60 compared to that when ph was 6 6 however no similar results was observed in this study implying that the intermittent low ph did not suppress the aob community 3 5 nitrifying microbial community after exposure to fna 16s rdna high throughput sequencing was used to analyze the microbial community structure of seeding sludge and mabr biofilms from day 331 before fna inhibition day 428 early stage when partial nitrification was established 468 days 7 weeks after partial nitrification was established fig 6 at the phylum level proteobacteria accounted for 44 7 66 8 as the most dominant phylum in the biofilm community structure xu et al 2018 followed by bacteroidetes which accounted for 23 2 32 4 the percentage of acidobacteria decreased from 6 8 to 0 63 after exposure to fna indicating that this phylum of bacteria could not adapt to fna nitrospirae which mainly included the nob genus nitrospira and accounted for only 0 27 in the seeding sludge was enriched to 10 3 in the biofilm on day 334 then decreased to 3 1 after phase iv and further decreased to 0 57 after 7 weeks of sequencing batch operation in phase va actinobacteria increased from 1 6 to 9 1 after exposure to fna which might have some resistance to fna due to its thicker cell wall at the genus level the dominant bacterial groups in the biofilm included nitrosomonas nitrosospira nitrospira chujaibacter and rhodanobacter under the order of xanthomonadales as well as uncultured genera under the families of chitinophagaceae and microscillaceae the relative abundance of nitrification related bacteria genera showed obvious changes after exposure to fna the nob genus nitrospira decreased from 10 3 to 3 1 and further decreased to 0 56 after 7 weeks of fna strengthened operation confirming that fna eliminated nitrospira in both phase iv and phase va however since the effluent no3 n concentration did not decrease during the 7 weeks of phase va the residual nob might have higher specific activity and better adaptation to fna the aob genus nitrosomonas increased from 5 9 to 14 8 indicating that fna did not reduced their number the increase of nitrosospira from less than 0 1 to 5 5 might be due to their stronger adaptation to high fna concentration and low substrate concentration dytczak et al 2008 cua stein 2011 the increase of nitrosospira was also beneficial for the arr of the reactor at low ph li et al 2020 certain species under the genus comamonas also have functions of partial nitrification and denitrification patureau et al 1997 and the relative abundance of this genus increased from 1 1 to 6 4 after exposure to fna the anammox bacterium candidatus brocadia accounted for 1 4 of the biofilm on day 468 illustrating that the sequencing batch mabr had a suitable environment for the growth of anammox bacteria and that anammox deammonification pathways might have existed in the mabr 4 conclusions in this study partial nitrification was established in a sequencing batch mabr the following conclusions are summarized 1 the fa and fna based strategies were proposed to establish partial nitrification in the sequencing batch mabr the fa based strategy could establish partial nitrification with the influent nh4 n over 200 mg n l and the fna based strategy could stabilize partial nitrification with influent nh4 n over 100 mg n l without additional chemicals 2 the sequencing batch operation was critical in the fa and fna based strategies in the fa based strategy the sequencing batch mode enabled high fa concentration at the beginning of each operating cycle in the fna based strategy the sequencing batch operation could maintain higher average activity of aob than continuous operating mode which enabled lower final ph for nob suppression by fna 2 the elimination effect of fna on nob was observed in the fna based strategy which solved the problem that nob could not be washed out from the mabr biofilm and strengthened the stability of partial nitrification process in mabr 3 the elimination effect of fna on nob was observed in the fna based strategy which solved the problem that nob could not be washed out from the mabr biofilm and strengthened the stability of partial nitrification process in mabr 4 bubbleless aeration of mabr limited the blow off of carbon dioxide and further inhibited the activity of aob by affecting the equilibrium range of ph in practical applications intermittent bubble aeration should be added to blow off the carbon dioxide for higher aob activity and shorter hrt while controlling the biofilm thickness declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

14704,anaerobic digestion ad is a favorable way to convert organic pollutants such as food waste fw into clean energy through microbial action this work adopted a side stream thermophilic anaerobic digestion sta strategy to improve a digestive system s efficiency and stability results showed that the sta strategy brought higher methane production as well as higher system stability it quickly adapted to thermal stimulation and increased the specific methane production from 359 ml ch4 g vs to 439 ml ch4 g vs which was also higher than 317 ml ch4 g vs from single stage thermophilic anaerobic digestion further exploration of the mechanism of sta using metagenomic and metaproteomic analysis revealed enhanced activity of key enzymes the main metabolic pathway was up regulated while the dominant bacteria were concentrated and the multifunctional methanosarcina was enriched these results indicate that sta optimized organic metabolism patterns comprehensively promoted methane production pathways and formed various energy conservation mechanisms further the system s limited heating avoided adverse effects from thermal stimulation and activated enzyme activity and heat shock proteins through circulating slurries which improved the metabolic process showing great application potential graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion side stream thermophilic anaerobic digestion methane production metagenomic analysis proteomics analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is a favorable way to recycle resources that is capable of converting organic pollutants such as food waste fw into clean energy methane ch4 through microbial action which is important for carbon emission reduction hao et al 2015 however anaerobic digestion performance is highly dependent on various parameters such as organic loading rate digester structure and digestive temperature which impact methane production previous research has found that using thermophilic 55 c anaerobic digestion to treat fine sieved fraction fsf in a wastewater treatment plant provided better performance than mesophilic 35 c anaerobic digestion ghasimi et al 2015 here the authors also concluded that the high temperatures promoted the dissolution of organic matter and improved mass transfer efficiency while the thermophilic microorganisms have higher hydrolysis efficiency for polysaccharides additionally research has found that increasing the reactor s temperature by 10 c will increase enzymatic activity by 2 3x eshtiaghi et al 2013 together these parameter changes will help overcome the rate limiting step of hydrolysis in anaerobic digestion and provide sufficient available substrate for subsequent methanogenic processes for mesophilic anaerobic digestion however it is more advantageous in terms of system stability and applicability for treated substrates kim et al 2002 because the mesophilic microorganisms show higher microbial community diversity that facilitates the metabolic balance of hydrolysis acid production and methanogenesis which enhances system resistance to toxic intermediates such as acetate propionate and ammonia labatut et al 2014 therefore combining the advantages of both methods will create new strategies that improve ad methanogenic potential and stability as well as their quality and efficiency previously several groups have tried to combine mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion mad and tad these studies mainly focused on improving strategies for two phase anaerobic digestion ge et al 2011 specifically several focused connecting the thermophilic reactor in series before the thermophilic reactor to strengthen the hydrolysis and acidification process as a pretreatment measure before the methanogenic phase qin et al 2017 used temperature phased anaerobic digestion tpad to treat waste activated sludge and combined a thermophilic hydrolysis phase at 55 70 c with a mesophilic methanogenic phase at 35 c that effectively improved organic matter removal and methane conversion efficiency however the opposite effect was found in another tpad study with fw as the substrate xiao et al 2018 in the start up stage the ph value of the thermophilic reactor decreased rapidly with the accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfa during the subsequent stable period the biogas and methane production in the tpad was lower than those of the mad and tad and the ph value of the thermophilic reactor was stable at 3 66 3 95 the authors hypothesized that the difference was due to the substrate as fw is primarily composed of easily biodegradable organic matter zhang et al 2014 and that heating during the hydrolysis phase would exacerbate vfa accumulation moreover other studies have shown that the thermophilic hydrolysis phase lacks buffering capacity during the pretreatment step making it difficult for the system to recover from the acid shock and high temperature stimulation ao et al 2021 compared with tpad side stream thermophilic anaerobic digestion sta has great potential when fw is used as substrate for anaerobic digestion these side stream reactors allow part of the sludge from the main reactor to enter the side stream reactor for separate treatment this sludge is then briefly exposed to high temperatures and returned to the main reactor for sludge mixing in this setup forward circulation from the main reactor to the side stream reactor provides abundant microorganisms for thermophilic digestion the reverse circulation back to the main reactor provides sufficient dissolved organic matter and enzyme activity further promoting microbial communities and enhancing methane production performance with engineering sta also has many advantages for example the side stream reactor has a small volume a short residence time and a short heating time allowing for low heating energy consumption and maintenance costs in addition to multiple digestion processes bioinformatic technology can more clearly reveal and characterize different metabolic mechanisms in these digesters currently most genetic information from the different types of microbial communities in ad systems is obtained from amplicon sequencing technologies still the metabolic function of many of these microorganisms is unknown and their diversity and functional redundancy may lead to a misinterpretation of their metabolic function at the community level to overcome these issues metagenomics allows for the whole genome to be sequenced and provides the necessary building blocks to reconstruct the metabolic pathway of these microorganisms however metagenomic sequencing alone can only reflect the spatial existence of microorganisms and cannot distinguish them between living dormant or dead species metaproteomics can describe metabolic regulation in microorganisms at the protein level lin et al 2016 these genes and proteins can be assembled and annotated and then assigned to specific microbial species and enzymes together these methods allow for the characterization of metabolically active microorganisms and the analysis of their metabolic processes that regulate enzyme synthesis and drive biotransformation both at the macroscopic and microscopic levels this study established a side stream thermophilic anaerobic digestion reactor coupled with mesophilic anaerobic digestion aiming to enhance the conversion of organic substrates from fw to methane and maintain systematic stability digestion performance under different reactor modes was examined and compared to clarify the intrinsic mechanism metagenomics and metaproteomics was used to identify microbial community structure key enzymes and metabolic activities of functional microorganisms in the sta the results of this study provide a cornerstone for future research and industry that can more efficiently break down food waste and reduce carbon emissions 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates and inoculum the food waste used in this study was prepared in the laboratory the main components were distilled water rice vegetables lean pork and tofu and the weight ratio of each component was 10 4 3 2 1 the ingredients were cooked after mixing then homogenized with an electric blender 5 mm and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c to prevent corruption until they were used in the experiment inoculated sludge was provided by chongqing tangjiatuo sewage treatment plant wwtp in china before use it was placed in an anaerobic environment at normal temperature for one week consuming excess organic matter then the supernatant was removed and the sludge was filtered by a 20 mesh sieve the treated inoculated sludge was also stored in a refrigerator at 4 c the characteristics of the substrate and inoculum are listed in table s1 2 2 digester set up and operational conditions experiments were performed in nine reactors belonging to three groups each with three parallel samples the three groups of reactors were set as thermophilic anaerobic digestion control group tc side stream thermophilic anaerobic digestion sta and side stream anaerobic digestion sd among them tc is a single stage reactor with operating temperature of 55 c sta consists of a side stream reactor 55 c and a main reactor 35 c sd consists of a side stream reactor 35 c and a main reactor 35 c as control the reactor structure for the sta is shown in figure s1 the main reactor operates at 35 c with the volume of 3 l while the side stream reactor operates at the temperature of 55 c with the volume of 0 6 l the retention time of the circulating slurry in the side stream reactor is 3 h which was determined by pre experiment figure s2 then the slurry in the side stream reactor was transferred to the main reactor and fully mixed the circulation was achieved via a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 190 ml min to provide comparison the sd with a side stream reactor operating at 35 c and the tc with a main reactor operating at 55 c both sd and sta were operated with a 1 6 cycle ratio all reactors were operated semi continuously with a constant hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 days the organic load ratios olr of 3 0 g vs l d 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 chemical and physical analysis digestate sludge and biogas samples were collected from each reactor during the whole process of anaerobic digestion and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod alkalinity and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n were measured according to standard methods jenkins 1982 sludge temperature was measured by thermometer ph was determined by ph meter fe28 mettler toledo switzerland the biogas composition h2 ch4 co2 and vfa composition acetate propionate butyrate were analysed by gas chromatography jiedao gc1690 hangzhou samples were taken after each reactor was stabilized and total solids ts and volatile solids vs were determined measured as described previously li et al 2022 2 3 2 metagenomic sequencing and metaproteomic analysis when all reactors were stabilized metagenomic sequencing was performed on the samples and metaproteomic analysis was performed on them the total genomic dna from the samples was extracted using e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna content was checked by the tbs 380 method and the purity of extracted dna was determined with the nanodrop2000 method the dna extract quality was tested using 1 agarose gel the dna was cut into pieces of approximately 400 bases using ultrasound covaris m220 usa a genomic sequence library was created using nextflex rapid dna seq the sequencing was then completed using the illumina novaseq hiseq xten illumina inc san diego ca usa by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china the protein of each sample was quantified by the label free method protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid bca and using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page analysis evaluate the sample quality trypsin were added to the treated proteins for enzymatic digestion and the resulting peptides were quantified using the thermo fisher scientific 23275 kit metagenomics sequencing results were used to establish a database and protein information was identified by database search with the library checking software proteomediscoverertm software 2 4 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova is used to evaluate the significance of the results if the calculated p is less than 0 05 the corresponding results are considered to be statistically significant in this study ibm spss statistical method was used for statistical analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 digestive performance figure 1 shows the time course of the digestion performance of sd sta and tc starting on day 1 all reactors were operated under the same conditions at 35 c and each digester remained stable on day 9 direct high temperature and side steam high temperature were applied to tc and sta respectively and the operational conditions for sd remained unchanged for the tc reactor the high temperature caused the system to fluctuate violently and then stabilize gradually after 30 days figure s3 the shaded areas in fig 1 represent omitted tc culture stages corresponding to the shaded part in figure s3 and the three groups demonstrated varying digestion performances after heating with tc the specific methane production gradually decreased while the ph increased to 7 8 fig 1a b the vfa concentration also rapidly increased and propionate became the most prominent component fig 1c s4 which indicated that the microbial balance was broken by heating and the digestive performance gradually deteriorated however the sta system became stable after a short period of fluctuation and its ph stabilized at 7 55 and released a specific methane production of about 439 ml ch4 g vs fig 1a b in addition to better stability with sta biotransformation processes from fw to methane have also been enhanced hydrolysis is commonly regarded as the first step of methane production and higher hydrolysis efficiency provides more dissolved organic substrates for subsequent acidification and methanogenesis in fig 2 the sta showed higher vs removal rates than sd and scod and nh4 n concentrations increased significantly after heating p 0 05 the increase in concentration was very similar in the sta and tc systems indicating that short periods of heating in the side stream reactor of the sta improved hydrolysis of carbohydrates and proteins similar to tc in these systems acidification is another factor that affects stability and efficiency early on in operation the ph and vfa fig 1b and c fluctuated for the sta causing the ph to rise to 7 7 and the accumulation of propionate figure s4 however after one week of operation the microorganisms became attuned to the alternative thermophilic and mesophilic conditions at this time propionate was largely consumed and acetate reemerged as the most dominant vfa component figure s4 this data suggests that sta may re enrich some thermotolerant microorganisms that promote the conversion of propionate to acetate instead of the original mesophilic microorganisms the enhanced hydrolysis acidification process provides a sufficient substrate for subsequent methanogenesis and the interaction of many microorganisms can optimize the utilization of these resources lin et al 2016 which allows for a significant improvement in methane production within sta systems the sta system maintained specific methane production at 439 ml ch4 g vs which was much higher than sd about 359 ml ch4 g vs and tc about 317 ml ch4 g vs this difference with the digesters was related to the special operating conditions of the sta specifically the side stream reactor in the sta was continuously heated for 3 h after the heated sludge returned to the main reactor the temperature of the main reactor was increased to 38 c and then lowered to 35 c within 50 min figure s5 consequently most of the time the digestive environment in the main reactor was identical to mesophilic anaerobic digestion conditions previously it has been shown that microbial communities are more diverse in mesophilic ad reactors which provide a larger number of parallel pathways for each metabolism step which is beneficial for the system to adapt to environmental pressures and maintain stability niu et al 2015 therefore the temperature mode of the sta system makes it more inclined to form a highly diverse microbial community structure and ensures a stable operating system meanwhile hydrolytic and acidified bacteria in highly diverse microbial communities are highly dynamic and rely on redundancy to maintain overall community function li et al 2018a these results indicate that heat stimulation with the side stream heating in the sta setup maintains stability for the system and enhances the buffer capacity of the reactor additionally it was sufficient to produce similar effects as thermophilic anaerobic digestion which significantly enhanced the transformation of organic matter and further promoted methane production efficiency 3 2 key enzymes in the complex network of anaerobic digestion microorganisms participate in many interactions such as competition symbiosis and metabolism which are driven by microbial enzymes enzymes are active proteins that are the most intuitive marker for organic matter degradation functional expression and microbial activity in anaerobic digestion therefore it is necessary to identify active microorganisms and metabolic processes at the enzymatic level to understand the sta s mechanism fig 3 illustrates the normalized abundance of several key enzymes amylase and α glucosidase are the main enzymes involved in the solubilization and hydrolysis of organic matter together they are responsible for breaking down carbohydrate chains such as starch and glycogen into small pieces that are further broken down to release glucose li et al 2018b compared with sd sta increased the expression of these two enzymes which supports the high level of organic transformation in ad the expression of these enzymes may also be attributed to heating previously wang et al 2010 also reported that the optimal reaction temperature that releases large amounts of cell free amylase was 55 c this result would also explain why the tc had higher enzyme expressions in the acid production stage acetate kinase ak butyrate kinase and phosphotransacetylase transform the polysaccharides and amino acids into short chain fatty acids after hydrolysis ak is the key enzyme in converting vfa especially propionate into acetate which the sta system enhances this enhancement is consistent with the vfa consumption trend observed in figure s4 these hydrolytic acidification enzyme trends have also been found in previous studies wang et al 2022b observed that thermophilic ad promoted the activities of key enzymes during hydrolysis by enhancing the electron transfer capacity for methane production acetoclastic and hydrotropic methane are the two major types that use acidification products like acetate and h2 co2 to produce methane respectively the enhancement of ak activity in the sta also positively impacts acetoclastic methanogenesis metabolism specifically f420 is the key enzyme for hydrotropic methanogenesis that provides electrons to activate co2 reduction vitt et al 2014 f420 was found to be increased in the sta system second only to ak which implies that the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway probably dominates after sta treatment additionally mcra was observed to be increased and its expression level was much higher than that of other key enzymes the type iv methyl directed restriction enzyme ecokmcra is the key enzyme that catalyzes the final step of methane production and is an ideal indicator for methane production performance casanas et al 2015 therefore sta may comprehensively promote various methanogenic processes and synergistically improve the conversion efficiency of substrates to methane when exposed to heat and other environmental pressures microorganisms use heat shock proteins hsps to interact with various cellular proteins as endogenous regulators to resist adverse effects garrido et al 2001 compared with the sd system the abundance of hsps in sta increased but it was far lower than that in the tc therefore the sta system may have suffered from limited heating stimulation it is possible to mobilize the hsps mechanism and use the microbial physiological compensation mechanism to maintain the stability of the sta system 3 3 microbial community and kegg pathway this work used metaproteomics to compare sequence data to the nr non redundant protein sequence database database to identify the microorganisms within each digester to obtain key functional microorganisms that enhance anaerobic digestion performance figure 4 a and table s2 show the major phyla and genera identified with relative abundances greater than 1 at the phylum level the dominant phyla for the sta and sd systems were firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobacteria thermotogae and euryarchaeota there was no significant difference in the proportions of the five phyla p 0 05 the microbial community in the sta system showed a very similar structure to the mesophilic ad system sd among them the first four phyla were functional bacteria that dominate hydrolytic acidification processes and can be subdivided into many species at the genus level ariesyady et al 2007 firmicutes is the most abundant bacteria in anaerobic digester and their dominant are the index of ad stability actinobacteria has a similar function to bacteroidetes and produces a variety of lyases involving the degradation of complex organic compounds and the utilization of vfa alalawy et al 2021 their high abundance ensures organic metabolism in the sta system and continuously provides substrates for subsequent methane production chloroflexi and spirochaetes make up a small proportion of the sta but their abundances are significantly higher than in the sd and tc systems metaproteomics data shows that these two microorganisms contribute key enzymes in multiple metabolic pathways figure s6 for example spirochaetes can be used as syntrophic primary degraders to establish symbiotic relationships with hydrogenotrophic methanogenic consumers which promote the degradation of organic matter and maintain a low partial pressure of h2 beraud martinez et al 2021 additionally chloroflexi has established physiological diversity and can use organic acids such as acetate and propionate klatt et al 2013 therefore their metabolic flexibility helps to provide additional promotion and colonization in the unique sta system environment at the genus level the distribution of dominant genera changed in the sta system among the bacterial genera sd had a variety of dominant bacterial genera with high abundance but the dominant bacteria of sta were more concentrated fig 4a the abundance of u o clostridiales decreased significantly while the proportions of active genera increased including u o bacteroidales and u p chloroflexi figure s6 and table s3 show metaproteomic results for functional proteins in these microorganisms among them u o bacteroidales which belongs to bacteroidetes significantly up regulated functional proteins after the sta treatments many of these proteins were mainly involved in signaling and cellular processes genetic information processing amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism table s3 together this data suggests that the sta treatment may play a role in how bacteria participate in cellular processes and other functions which may be beneficial to balance the hydrolytic acidification process in a thermophilic environment and maintain cell activity in addition the abundance of syntrophic oxidation bacteria u f syntrophomonadaceae and u p spirochaetes oxidize butyrate and propionate to produce acetate was shown to increase in sta nelson et al 2011 heating makes acetogenic conversions easier kim et al 2018 and limited heating in sta promotes the activities of these microorganisms further these active genera were all found to increase heat resistance parameters brought about by hsps and the stability made them more competitive than the other hydrolytic or acidic bacteria previous reports have also observed this result since heating makes organics more accessible for microorganisms and enriches thermophilic hydrolytic acidification bacteria climent et al 2007 zverlov et al 2010 however the sta system could not form high temperature conditions suitable for thermophilic anaerobic digestion and the relative abundance of the typical thermophilic hydrolytic bacterium defluviitoga was not significantly changed overall sta adjusted several of the dominant bacteria demonstrating the predominance involved in energy conservation organic metabolism and resistance to environmental stresses archaea within the sta system were found to have obvious changes compared to the sd system and were highly similar to the tc system this study showed that methanogenic archaea were more sensitive to heating than fermentation bacteria and the side stream heating in the sta system mainly regulated the methanogenic process compared to the sd system the abundance of methanosarcina in the sta significantly increased becoming the most dominant archaea previously it has been reported that methanosarcina generally lives in mesophilic or moderately thermophilic conditions and even with robust impairments can accommodate anaerobic digestion at 15 70 c de vrieze et al 2012 in comparison other archaea are usually inhibited by thermal damage which allows methanosarcina to occupy more niches this behavior may be the reason why methanosarcina was dramatically enriched in sta because methanosarcina can use many substrates such as acetate h2 co2 or methyl compounds it is unclear which major methanogenic pathway is used in the sta which needs to be explored further the relative abundance of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacterium and methanoculleus also increased however the abundance of methanothrix an obligate acetotrophic methanogen significantly decreased together methanobacterium and methanoculleus could work in syntropy with syntrophic oxidizing bacteria to generate methane xu et al 2021 which increased in the sta system and may be involved in the biotransformation of propionate to acetate additionally the expression of proteins identified in the three digesters was compared pairwise proteins with fc fold change values greater than 1 5 or less than 0 67 were considered differentially expressed proteins deps described in table s4 principal component analysis pca was performed on the proteins identified in the three digesters sta sd and tc functional proteins were separated figure s7 these trends imply that the sta system formed a metabolic pattern different from traditional mesophilic or thermophilic anaerobic digestion the kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database was used to annotate proteins and the 25 key kegg pathways with high degrees of deps enrichment were manually selected in the three comparison schemes these pathways mainly include carbohydrate metabolism amino acid metabolism energy metabolism and other modules fig 4b the distribution of deps was highly unified across the three comparison schemes but the number in sta and sd was significantly lower than that in the other two groups furthermore a visual volcano diagram of the deps was drawn to distinguish the proteins whose expression levels were up regulated and down regulated at different significant levels figure s8 the results were similar the number of deps in the sta and sd comparison was the least and they showed the lowest expression levels with the other digesters furthermore these up regulated proteins up deps outnumbered the down regulated proteins down deps these results showed that the sta and sd systems were the most similar in actual metabolic functionality and that heating mainly enhanced the expression of functional proteins in sta this verified the up regulation of key enzymes fig 3 among these pathways carbohydrate metabolism was expressed more than amino acid metabolism which is consistent with the results shown in fig 2 glycolysis pyruvate metabolism and vfa metabolism were visibly regulated constituting the main steps of organic matter utilization and providing available substrate acetate for methanogens methane metabolism is a strongly and differentially expressed module consistent with the significant changes in methanogens and increased methanogenic performance in the sta the amount of deps in methane metabolism is greater than in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism and the enzymes related to methanogenesis were also significantly expressed more than others fig 3 as a result sta may be the dominant process controlling the methanogenesis pathway moreover functional proteins from other metabolisms such as abc transporter quorum sensing and ribosome module proteins were found to be differentially expressed classically abc transporters are associated with important functions such as protein transport and atp transfer ribosomes are associated with protein synthesis and they are central to microbial activity and functional protein expression kang et al 2021 together these pathways were effectively regulated to facilitate microbial resistance to environmental stressors and promote dna repair in the sta system at high temperatures 3 4 metaproteomics analysis 3 4 1 carbohydrate metabolism metaproteomic analysis was used to analyze the deps sta and sd involved in the transformation and utilization of carbohydrates in sta to define the regulatory role of sta on the substrate conversion process information on the key enzymes in these metabolic processes is listed in table s5 1 and fig 5 figure 5 illustrates that the key enzymes in glycolysis were up regulated and that microorganisms use stored glycogen through glycolysis to obtain supplementary acetyl coa adenosine triphosphate atp and reducing ability the most critical enzyme fructose 1 6 bisphosphate aldolase fba was specifically up regulated with an fc as high as 38 13 because fba occupies a central position in glycolysis a strong increase in fba activity may help generate additional atp to promote atp dependent processes patipong et al 2019 such as protein degradation that hsps regulate fba was also found to form a temperature dependent protein complex with hsps meng et al 2009 implying that hsps also regulated expression indeed many hsps were differentially up regulated in sta which is required for cell growth or survival at higher temperatures see section 3 4 4 in addition gapdh and tpi are two more deps that were significantly increased in sta together with fba they act as the up stream and down stream links to ga 3 p a key glycolysis node gapdh has a variety of functions with glycolysis being the most prominent it provides additional support for essential functions associated with microbial activity such as transcription signal transduction and membrane transport sirover 2011 additionally gapdh is in charge of the additional oxidation of ga 3 p which forms nadp and h and serves as the primary rate limiting step in glycolysis van den bossche et al 2017 tpi participates in the conversion of glycerone p to ga 3 p together the significant up regulation of these key enzymes correlates to increased glucose uptake glycolytic flux and carbohydrate metabolism these processes will ultimately produce a high level of atp and excess carbon that can be used as building blocks for the rapid proliferation and de novo generation of nucleotides lipids and proteins viola et al 2019 additionally intermediate metabolites from glycolysis act as important substrates for the pentose phosphate pathway ppp the key enzymes in most steps of ppp were also up regulated and fructose 6 phosphate aldolase fpa showed the highest expression fpa participates in multiple transformation processes for the non oxidative ppp and is beneficial to maintaining the flux balance of ppp the metabolites of non oxidized ppp can be reversibly oriented to form an intermediate in glycolysis and carbon is shunted through glycolysis via an erythrose 4 phosphate intermediate stincone et al 2015 therefore increased ppp in sta was beneficial for glycolysis ppp is also a significant source of nadph which is the key hydrogen donor for various biochemical reactions in microorganisms the regulation of ppp in sta was beneficial to retain intracellular redox balance that enhances stress resistance for microorganisms lin et al 2018 moreno et al 2021 tao et al 2022 furthermore pyruvate a byproduct of glycolysis can link serine metabolism and be further oxidized to acetyl coa which por and kor drive the central key biomolecules in carbohydrate lipid and amino acid catabolism moffett et al 2020 por and kor were significantly up regulated in sta which benefits the circulation of glycolysis produced substances and initiates fatty acid metabolism enzymes in two steps of the tca cycle in sta were observed to be significantly up regulated sdh hub linking oxidative phosphorylation to electron transport and enzymes in the reversible transformation of succinyl coa to 2 oxoglutarate the products of these enzymatically driven reactions are associated with amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism which may promote fatty acid oxidation previously another study that explored thermophilic anaerobic co digestion also found that the tca cycle enhanced the biosynthesis of amino acids and acetyl coa zhang et al 2023 therefore sta regulates the tca cycle and affects microbial metabolism the syntrophic oxidation bacteria that can alleviate vfa accumulation including u p chloroflexi u f syntrophomonadaceae defluviitoga acetomicrobium and u f synergistaceae have been observed in sta they can drive propionate and butyrate degradation through conventional methylmalonyl coa and β oxidation pathways and finally form acetate enzymes that act as major steps in propionate and butonate metabolism were observed to be significantly upregulated in particular acka and pta which are important in propionyl coenzyme a synthesis were highly expressed and significantly up regulated the expression of these key enzymes promotes the consumption of vfa especially propionate which is consistent with the results in fig s4 in addition the carboxylation of propionyl coa and the formation of butyryl coa and its subsequent conversion to acetate by acetyl coa synthetase can release atp hao et al 2020 promoting these key enzymes in sta is beneficial for anaerobic digestion s energy metabolism balance acetate can be further oxidized by syntropic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob key enzymes in the reversed wood ljungdahl pathway were correspondingly up regulated especially the subunit cdhcde acse in the bifunctional complex codh acs which catalyzes the transfer of the methyl moiety bound to tetrahydrofolate adam et al 2018 saob completes the conversion of co2 and acetate opposite to the reductive acetyl coa pathway generally speaking sao relies on energy sharing with hydrogenotrophic methanogens hattori 2008 because its standard free energy δg0 is 104 6 kj mol its growth is slow due to its energy disadvantage however at high temperatures sao becomes more thermodynamically favorable dolfing 2014 the abundance of thermophilic and heat resistant saob was found to be increased in sta as well including u f anaerolineaceae u f syntrophomonadaceae and u f synergistaceae this breakthrough in thermodynamic limitation also promoted vfa interconversion and hydrotropic methanogenesis processes in the sao reaction chain from these metaproteomic comparisons it is worth noting that the proteins that were specifically up regulated in these pathways usually act on key or rate limiting steps even though their total expression with their deps was reduced finally sta may inhibit microorganisms sensitive to higher temperatures by weakening unnecessary steps and concentrating energy and carbon on key functions for these microorganisms thus the sta has a favorable impact on functional microorganisms and key enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism 3 4 2 amino acid metabolism under the influence of microorganisms proteins typically break down into amino acids and peptides amino acids can undergo further degradation through deamination resulting in ammonia nitrogen formation wu et al 2021 the information on deps related to major amino acid metabolism in sta was identified and the active enzymes key microorganisms and specific metabolic pathways were analyzed table s5 2 fig 6 glycine serine and threonine metabolism are the most differentially expressed modules and they were higher than other amino acid metabolism pathways usually serine glycine and cysteine are synthesized through the 3 phosphoglycolate pathway carried out through a series of phosphorylated intermediates among them the key enzymes sera serc and serb regulate the synthesis and metabolism of the serine family and are linked to glycolysis the thermotolerant bacteria u p chloroflexi and the thermophilic bacteria defluviitoga significantly up regulated these enzymes it is worth noting that sera is the rate limiting enzyme in serine synthesis and is also essential for protein synthesis and cell growth wang et al 2022a its remarkable expression in the sta system means it specifically regulates the restriction step in the phosphorylation pathway with the other proteins serc is known to be temperature responsive and it s been previously shown that its transcription levels can be down regulated under high temperature stress wang et al 2013 however the expression of serc in sta increased which benefited from the dominant genus u p chloroflexi and the expression of serb from the thermophilic genus defluviitoga was also significantly increased in addition serine can also be derived from glycine which is formed from glyoxylate through transamination the increase of shmt and agxt the key enzymes in this reversible process is beneficial for regulating serine family proteins and synthesizing necessary precursors of various cell proliferation related biomolecules yoshida et al 2004 for instance glycine contributes carbon and nitrogen to the biosynthesis of purines porphyrins and other metabolites serine is a branch node that is central to cysteine and methionine metabolism the expression of cysk the key enzyme involved in cysteine synthesis by serine was up regulated as was that of aspb and tst which are critical for cysteine deamination in addition to catalyzing the degradation of cysteine to produce pyruvate aspb may also be important for the biosynthesis of coenzyme m in methanogens cysteine deamination can produce sulfopyruvate an enzyme in the coenzyme m synthesis pathway that has not been found to be differentially expressed in methanogens helgadóttir et al 2007 therefore the regulation of amino acid metabolism by the sta system may also be beneficial for enhancing methane production sta showed the highest expression of deps in the alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism pathways the key enzymes that catalyze the metabolism of aspartate and glutamate pyridoxal phosphate plp dependent and glutamate dehydrogenase gdh were significantly up regulated in sta they regulate the production of oxaloacetate and 2 oxoglutarate in the tca cycle and then succinate is produced via 2 oxoacid ferredoxin oxidoreductase subunit gamma and 2 oxoacid acceptor oxidoreductase subunit alpha bruscalupi et al 2023 mueser et al 2020 therefore the regulation of alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism in the sta system may be the main reason for the specific up regulation of the related steps observed in the tca cycle fig 5 in addition glutamine is the primary nitrogen donor for protein and nucleotide synthesis and is essential for cell proliferation wise and thompson 2010 alanine can be deaminated and converted into pyruvate by the alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase family of proteins both of them play an important role in carbohydrate metabolism in sta the total amount of deps was less than carbohydrate metabolism meaning that sta less strongly regulates amino acid metabolism and retains more of the original mesophilic bacteria at the same time the key enzymes provided by the thermophilic and thermotolerant microorganisms show high activity that participates in the rate limiting step of amino acid metabolism and plays important auxiliary functions in cell proliferation methane metabolism and the tca cycle 3 4 3 methane metabolism the distribution of deps in the methane metabolism pathway and the metabolic functions in which enzymes participate were analyzed fig 7 and figure s9 related information about deps can be seen in table s5 3 and table s6 the pathways of methane production can be divided into three types based on the type of substrate methylotrophic methanogenesis m00356 acetoclastic methanogenesis m00357 and hydrotropic methanogenesis m00567 the results show that all three pathways are obviously enhanced and most of the enzymes were highly expressed after sta regulation so the balance among them improves the performance of the reactor in addition down regulated deps were mainly from methanothrix while up regulated deps were mainly from methanosarcina consistent with the archaeal community structure changes fig 4a the expression of enzymes in the methylotrophic methanogenesis pathway was relatively small in sta which suggests that their contribution to methane production might be negligible acetoclastic methanogenesis am and hydrotropic methanogenesis hm pathways are the main modes of methane production in anaerobic digestion it is reported that the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway is strongly inhibited by high temperature anaerobic digestion and that hydrotropic methanogenesis can increase as the temperature changes from 37 to 55 c pap et al 2015 the results with the tc system show that acetoclastic methanogenesis greatly weakened while the hydrotropic methanogenesis pathway mostly dominated table s6 however there were differences between these pathways in the sta system specifically deps in the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway were significantly increased and were higher than in other methane production pathways although the obligate acetoclastic methanogen methanothrix was inhibited in the sta system the facultative methanogen methanosarcina demonstrated high tolerance and was significantly up regulated among these the fc values of co dehydrogenase acetyl coa synthetase cdhcde acetate kinase acka and phosphate acetyltransferase pta in methanosarcina were 5 86 5 4 and 3 06 respectively together they facilitated acetate utilization by the methanogens various energy conversion hydrogenases in the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway were also significantly up regulated the expression of the ech hydrogenase ech complex subunits abcdef for example was significantly up regulated in sta and the subunits were from the same microorganism methanosarcina implying the purification of specific functions ech contributed to energy conservation by coupling reduced ferredoxin fd oxidation with proton reduction which may be another reason for the promotion of acetoclastic methanogenesis katsyv and muller 2022 because the methanogenesis process with multiple energy conversion systems saves energy it is beneficial to meet the energy demand of regulating proton balance and supplementing h when cells are exposed to high temperatures wang et al 2022c welte et al 2010 in addition in fermentation ech can release supernumerary electrons during acetate and co2 production by reducing h to h2 maintaining the redox balance required for the metabolism of cellular functions schoelmerich and muller 2020 soboh et al 2004 in the hydrotropic methanogenesis pathway the expression of eha and ehb which have similar functions to ech was not enhanced but the homologous ni fe hydrogenase cytochrome f420 reducing hydrogenases frhabg were significantly up regulated frh donates electrons to reduce com s s cob which is essential to the hydrogenotrophic pathway but has a dispensable role in the methylotrophic pathway in addition frh can establish a membrane bound electron transport chain with vht and hdr as the reduction end points of com s s cob that generates ionic power and produces atp by atp synthase kulkarni et al 2009 in addition almost all subunits of the v a type atpase were up regulated or expressed in large quantities v a type atpase is a proton pump that generates a proton gradient to provide proton power for transmembrane transport drory and nelson 2006 the v a type atpase in methanosarcina may be responsible for proton pumping atpases to participate in atp synthesis and meet the cell s atp dependence physiological needs sekiya 2022 these key enzymes were highly expressed and greatly increased which may be another important energy conservation mechanism for archaea in sta it was observed that obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogens provided a large number of functional proteins about hm with enhanced expression which explained the proliferation of methanobacterium and methanoculleus according to previous research the relative abundance of hydrotropic methanogens is the limiting factor in the co culture bioaugmentation process in sao and hm fotidis et al 2013 in sta increased saob methanobacterium and methanoculleus jointly promoted the hydrotropic methanogenesis pathway generally speaking acetoclastic methanogens and syntrophic partners saob hydrogenotrophic methanogens compete for acetate through cross feeding hattori 2008 so it is worth paying attention to the balance between two methanogenic pathways in sta in fact the expression of specific enzymes for hydrotropic methanogenesis was relatively low compared to acetoclastic methanogenesis and the promotion of active enzymes for hydrotropic methanogenesis is incomplete even though one deps in hm had a higher fc value 11 6 therefore it is possible that heating in sta promotes both hm and am however the enhancement of hm may be unstable and unbalanced at the same time the significantly enhanced energy conservation mechanism in methanogens reduces the environmental pressure on both pathways which is beneficial to the balance of the two methane production routes 3 4 4 hsps and heat shock different microbial communities were formed in thermophilic and mesophilic anaerobic digestion fig 4a and the slurry circulation in sta promoted the interaction between these two microbial communities together this may created a new microbial coexistence mode in sta and improved its performance hsps play an important role in overcoming heat shock hs and improving microorganisms adaptability to temperature changes hsps can form complexes with other proteins that prevent proteins from aggregating and undergoing thermal denaturation ensuring the cell s normal function at high temperatures ji et al 2019 figure s10 and table s5 4 demonstrate the identification and analysis of deps expression in relation to hsps table s5 shows that compared to sd there is a significant increase in the total expression of deps related to hsps in sta including dnaj dnak groes groel and hsp20 most of the up deps were related to microorganisms that showed increased relative abundance in sta and they were also highly coincident with key microorganisms that lead to the specific enhancement of key enzymes in metabolism these results show that sta can improve heat resistance in the dominant genera and increase metabolic function hsp molecular chaperones usually work together during heat shock regulation richter et al 2010 and their interaction with dominant microorganisms is highly correlated to functional protein activity for example although the relative abundance of the thermophilic bacteria thermotogae in sta did not increase it provided the largest increase fc 39 7 and the highest expression level of hsps which could help other microorganisms overcome hs among these hsps hsp20 is the dep with the largest up regulation and expression which is the main family of hsps and may play a key role in the heat resistance of sta hsp20 prevents protein denaturation and keeps proteins in a folding competent state and they can participate in atp dependent disaggregation through the hsp70 90 chaperone system park and seo 2015 actinobacteria and methanosarcina were the main groups that harbored hsp20 sequences dnak the bacterial hsp70 homolog was significantly up regulated it is an important component of the cellular chaperone network and atp hydrolysis regulates its expression qiu et al 2006 as a result the significant up regulation may benefit from sta regulated energy metabolism dnaj hsp40 was also promoted because of the high temperature stimulation in sta it acts as a multifunctional protein that combines with partner dnak hsp70 the specific expression of dnaj is beneficial for atp hydrolysis and regulates the functional activity of dnak takayama et al 1999 groel and groes were a group of highly expressed chaperones groel is a bacterial homolog of hsp60 and groes usually modulates groel s atpase activity mathew and morimoto 1998 in prokaryotes groel and dnaj jointly regulate the atpase activity of dnak and promote the effective release of nucleotides among these deps methanosarcina had the most up deps zhang et al 2006 discovered that when methanogens were exposed to an hour of heat shock the hsp70 and hsp60 systems were up regulated the findings suggest that methanosarcina may be the dominant microorganism in sta resistant to heat shock in addition heat shock proteins participate in several important processes related to growth including protein folding refolding assembly translocation degradation and their transport through cell membranes for example dnaj hsp 40 is essential for folding and refolding proteins correct folding and assembly of the newly translated polypeptides are required for functional protein formation and maintenance qiu et al 2006 hsp70 and hsp40 families are also found to associate with ribosomes in the ribosome mrna is translated into linear polypeptides which play an important role in regulating the activity of functional proteins hundley et al 2002 therefore the specific up regulation of these heat shock proteins is beneficial for expressing other active proteins this up regulation means that the hsps promoted by heating in sta can help the physiological regulation of microorganisms in all aspects which may be an important reason for sta s excellent performance 3 4 5 overall summary the sta system created a unique strategy of combining thermophilic anaerobic digestion with mesophilic anaerobic digestion which enhanced the resistance of the ad system to environmental pressures and ensured stability with high level metabolism the microbial community structure had changed adaptively forming a microbial community with more metabolic advantages and physiological diversity promoting the functional activities of key enzymes and greatly improving the conversion efficiency of organic matter with better methane production performance fig 8 specifically sludge circulation and heating in the side stream reactor of sta activated the expression of hsp molecular chaperone prevented protein degeneration improved the heat resistance of dominant bacteria and maintained the physiological activity of microorganisms further sta concentrated and evolved dominant genera of bacteria and enriched a large number of dominant archaea especially methanosarcina functional microorganisms proliferated and established a close co culture relationship and sta showed better energy strategies and metabolic patterns with metabolism sta promoted the rate limiting steps in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism the hydrolysis acidification process and the transformation of intermediate metabolites which releases energy and plays a positive role in other metabolism and cell metabolic support function the methane metabolism was strongly promoted and stronger than other organic matter metabolism modules among them acetoclastic methanogenesis and hydrotropic methanogenesis pathways were enhanced to different degrees with the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway dominating the multiple energy conservation mechanisms of methanosarcina promoted a balance between the acetoclastic methanogenesis and hydrotropic methanogenesis pathways coupled with syntrophic acetate oxidizing facilitating the system s efficient operation meanwhile compared to conventional thermophilic anaerobic digestion sta presented low energy and operating costs and possessed a richer microbial community structure and cellular stability which can take full advantage of the material conversion promoted by heating maintain the system s stability and produce excellent digestive performance concisely anaerobic digestion based on sta is a promising strategy for improving the quality and efficiency of conventional anaerobic digestion 4 conclusions sta is a promising strategy for anaerobic digestion to enhance methanogenic performance and improve the stability of thermophilic anaerobic digestion of easily hydrolyzed substrates through cycling sta promotes hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis processes with high levels of metabolic activities the limited heating in the side stream reactor made the conversion of scfa to acetate occur more easily which facilitated the consumption of vfa and improved the enzymatic activity of metabolic links sta established a strong microbial community structure and effectively maintained system stability methanogenic pathways were promoted in different degrees with acetoclastic methanogenesis being the most dominant in addition sta effectively controlled the negative effects of thermal stimulation and helped the multifunctional methanosarcina to occupy most of the ecological niches declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing interests or

14704,anaerobic digestion ad is a favorable way to convert organic pollutants such as food waste fw into clean energy through microbial action this work adopted a side stream thermophilic anaerobic digestion sta strategy to improve a digestive system s efficiency and stability results showed that the sta strategy brought higher methane production as well as higher system stability it quickly adapted to thermal stimulation and increased the specific methane production from 359 ml ch4 g vs to 439 ml ch4 g vs which was also higher than 317 ml ch4 g vs from single stage thermophilic anaerobic digestion further exploration of the mechanism of sta using metagenomic and metaproteomic analysis revealed enhanced activity of key enzymes the main metabolic pathway was up regulated while the dominant bacteria were concentrated and the multifunctional methanosarcina was enriched these results indicate that sta optimized organic metabolism patterns comprehensively promoted methane production pathways and formed various energy conservation mechanisms further the system s limited heating avoided adverse effects from thermal stimulation and activated enzyme activity and heat shock proteins through circulating slurries which improved the metabolic process showing great application potential graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion side stream thermophilic anaerobic digestion methane production metagenomic analysis proteomics analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is a favorable way to recycle resources that is capable of converting organic pollutants such as food waste fw into clean energy methane ch4 through microbial action which is important for carbon emission reduction hao et al 2015 however anaerobic digestion performance is highly dependent on various parameters such as organic loading rate digester structure and digestive temperature which impact methane production previous research has found that using thermophilic 55 c anaerobic digestion to treat fine sieved fraction fsf in a wastewater treatment plant provided better performance than mesophilic 35 c anaerobic digestion ghasimi et al 2015 here the authors also concluded that the high temperatures promoted the dissolution of organic matter and improved mass transfer efficiency while the thermophilic microorganisms have higher hydrolysis efficiency for polysaccharides additionally research has found that increasing the reactor s temperature by 10 c will increase enzymatic activity by 2 3x eshtiaghi et al 2013 together these parameter changes will help overcome the rate limiting step of hydrolysis in anaerobic digestion and provide sufficient available substrate for subsequent methanogenic processes for mesophilic anaerobic digestion however it is more advantageous in terms of system stability and applicability for treated substrates kim et al 2002 because the mesophilic microorganisms show higher microbial community diversity that facilitates the metabolic balance of hydrolysis acid production and methanogenesis which enhances system resistance to toxic intermediates such as acetate propionate and ammonia labatut et al 2014 therefore combining the advantages of both methods will create new strategies that improve ad methanogenic potential and stability as well as their quality and efficiency previously several groups have tried to combine mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion mad and tad these studies mainly focused on improving strategies for two phase anaerobic digestion ge et al 2011 specifically several focused connecting the thermophilic reactor in series before the thermophilic reactor to strengthen the hydrolysis and acidification process as a pretreatment measure before the methanogenic phase qin et al 2017 used temperature phased anaerobic digestion tpad to treat waste activated sludge and combined a thermophilic hydrolysis phase at 55 70 c with a mesophilic methanogenic phase at 35 c that effectively improved organic matter removal and methane conversion efficiency however the opposite effect was found in another tpad study with fw as the substrate xiao et al 2018 in the start up stage the ph value of the thermophilic reactor decreased rapidly with the accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfa during the subsequent stable period the biogas and methane production in the tpad was lower than those of the mad and tad and the ph value of the thermophilic reactor was stable at 3 66 3 95 the authors hypothesized that the difference was due to the substrate as fw is primarily composed of easily biodegradable organic matter zhang et al 2014 and that heating during the hydrolysis phase would exacerbate vfa accumulation moreover other studies have shown that the thermophilic hydrolysis phase lacks buffering capacity during the pretreatment step making it difficult for the system to recover from the acid shock and high temperature stimulation ao et al 2021 compared with tpad side stream thermophilic anaerobic digestion sta has great potential when fw is used as substrate for anaerobic digestion these side stream reactors allow part of the sludge from the main reactor to enter the side stream reactor for separate treatment this sludge is then briefly exposed to high temperatures and returned to the main reactor for sludge mixing in this setup forward circulation from the main reactor to the side stream reactor provides abundant microorganisms for thermophilic digestion the reverse circulation back to the main reactor provides sufficient dissolved organic matter and enzyme activity further promoting microbial communities and enhancing methane production performance with engineering sta also has many advantages for example the side stream reactor has a small volume a short residence time and a short heating time allowing for low heating energy consumption and maintenance costs in addition to multiple digestion processes bioinformatic technology can more clearly reveal and characterize different metabolic mechanisms in these digesters currently most genetic information from the different types of microbial communities in ad systems is obtained from amplicon sequencing technologies still the metabolic function of many of these microorganisms is unknown and their diversity and functional redundancy may lead to a misinterpretation of their metabolic function at the community level to overcome these issues metagenomics allows for the whole genome to be sequenced and provides the necessary building blocks to reconstruct the metabolic pathway of these microorganisms however metagenomic sequencing alone can only reflect the spatial existence of microorganisms and cannot distinguish them between living dormant or dead species metaproteomics can describe metabolic regulation in microorganisms at the protein level lin et al 2016 these genes and proteins can be assembled and annotated and then assigned to specific microbial species and enzymes together these methods allow for the characterization of metabolically active microorganisms and the analysis of their metabolic processes that regulate enzyme synthesis and drive biotransformation both at the macroscopic and microscopic levels this study established a side stream thermophilic anaerobic digestion reactor coupled with mesophilic anaerobic digestion aiming to enhance the conversion of organic substrates from fw to methane and maintain systematic stability digestion performance under different reactor modes was examined and compared to clarify the intrinsic mechanism metagenomics and metaproteomics was used to identify microbial community structure key enzymes and metabolic activities of functional microorganisms in the sta the results of this study provide a cornerstone for future research and industry that can more efficiently break down food waste and reduce carbon emissions 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates and inoculum the food waste used in this study was prepared in the laboratory the main components were distilled water rice vegetables lean pork and tofu and the weight ratio of each component was 10 4 3 2 1 the ingredients were cooked after mixing then homogenized with an electric blender 5 mm and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c to prevent corruption until they were used in the experiment inoculated sludge was provided by chongqing tangjiatuo sewage treatment plant wwtp in china before use it was placed in an anaerobic environment at normal temperature for one week consuming excess organic matter then the supernatant was removed and the sludge was filtered by a 20 mesh sieve the treated inoculated sludge was also stored in a refrigerator at 4 c the characteristics of the substrate and inoculum are listed in table s1 2 2 digester set up and operational conditions experiments were performed in nine reactors belonging to three groups each with three parallel samples the three groups of reactors were set as thermophilic anaerobic digestion control group tc side stream thermophilic anaerobic digestion sta and side stream anaerobic digestion sd among them tc is a single stage reactor with operating temperature of 55 c sta consists of a side stream reactor 55 c and a main reactor 35 c sd consists of a side stream reactor 35 c and a main reactor 35 c as control the reactor structure for the sta is shown in figure s1 the main reactor operates at 35 c with the volume of 3 l while the side stream reactor operates at the temperature of 55 c with the volume of 0 6 l the retention time of the circulating slurry in the side stream reactor is 3 h which was determined by pre experiment figure s2 then the slurry in the side stream reactor was transferred to the main reactor and fully mixed the circulation was achieved via a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 190 ml min to provide comparison the sd with a side stream reactor operating at 35 c and the tc with a main reactor operating at 55 c both sd and sta were operated with a 1 6 cycle ratio all reactors were operated semi continuously with a constant hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 days the organic load ratios olr of 3 0 g vs l d 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 chemical and physical analysis digestate sludge and biogas samples were collected from each reactor during the whole process of anaerobic digestion and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod alkalinity and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n were measured according to standard methods jenkins 1982 sludge temperature was measured by thermometer ph was determined by ph meter fe28 mettler toledo switzerland the biogas composition h2 ch4 co2 and vfa composition acetate propionate butyrate were analysed by gas chromatography jiedao gc1690 hangzhou samples were taken after each reactor was stabilized and total solids ts and volatile solids vs were determined measured as described previously li et al 2022 2 3 2 metagenomic sequencing and metaproteomic analysis when all reactors were stabilized metagenomic sequencing was performed on the samples and metaproteomic analysis was performed on them the total genomic dna from the samples was extracted using e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna content was checked by the tbs 380 method and the purity of extracted dna was determined with the nanodrop2000 method the dna extract quality was tested using 1 agarose gel the dna was cut into pieces of approximately 400 bases using ultrasound covaris m220 usa a genomic sequence library was created using nextflex rapid dna seq the sequencing was then completed using the illumina novaseq hiseq xten illumina inc san diego ca usa by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china the protein of each sample was quantified by the label free method protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid bca and using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page analysis evaluate the sample quality trypsin were added to the treated proteins for enzymatic digestion and the resulting peptides were quantified using the thermo fisher scientific 23275 kit metagenomics sequencing results were used to establish a database and protein information was identified by database search with the library checking software proteomediscoverertm software 2 4 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova is used to evaluate the significance of the results if the calculated p is less than 0 05 the corresponding results are considered to be statistically significant in this study ibm spss statistical method was used for statistical analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 digestive performance figure 1 shows the time course of the digestion performance of sd sta and tc starting on day 1 all reactors were operated under the same conditions at 35 c and each digester remained stable on day 9 direct high temperature and side steam high temperature were applied to tc and sta respectively and the operational conditions for sd remained unchanged for the tc reactor the high temperature caused the system to fluctuate violently and then stabilize gradually after 30 days figure s3 the shaded areas in fig 1 represent omitted tc culture stages corresponding to the shaded part in figure s3 and the three groups demonstrated varying digestion performances after heating with tc the specific methane production gradually decreased while the ph increased to 7 8 fig 1a b the vfa concentration also rapidly increased and propionate became the most prominent component fig 1c s4 which indicated that the microbial balance was broken by heating and the digestive performance gradually deteriorated however the sta system became stable after a short period of fluctuation and its ph stabilized at 7 55 and released a specific methane production of about 439 ml ch4 g vs fig 1a b in addition to better stability with sta biotransformation processes from fw to methane have also been enhanced hydrolysis is commonly regarded as the first step of methane production and higher hydrolysis efficiency provides more dissolved organic substrates for subsequent acidification and methanogenesis in fig 2 the sta showed higher vs removal rates than sd and scod and nh4 n concentrations increased significantly after heating p 0 05 the increase in concentration was very similar in the sta and tc systems indicating that short periods of heating in the side stream reactor of the sta improved hydrolysis of carbohydrates and proteins similar to tc in these systems acidification is another factor that affects stability and efficiency early on in operation the ph and vfa fig 1b and c fluctuated for the sta causing the ph to rise to 7 7 and the accumulation of propionate figure s4 however after one week of operation the microorganisms became attuned to the alternative thermophilic and mesophilic conditions at this time propionate was largely consumed and acetate reemerged as the most dominant vfa component figure s4 this data suggests that sta may re enrich some thermotolerant microorganisms that promote the conversion of propionate to acetate instead of the original mesophilic microorganisms the enhanced hydrolysis acidification process provides a sufficient substrate for subsequent methanogenesis and the interaction of many microorganisms can optimize the utilization of these resources lin et al 2016 which allows for a significant improvement in methane production within sta systems the sta system maintained specific methane production at 439 ml ch4 g vs which was much higher than sd about 359 ml ch4 g vs and tc about 317 ml ch4 g vs this difference with the digesters was related to the special operating conditions of the sta specifically the side stream reactor in the sta was continuously heated for 3 h after the heated sludge returned to the main reactor the temperature of the main reactor was increased to 38 c and then lowered to 35 c within 50 min figure s5 consequently most of the time the digestive environment in the main reactor was identical to mesophilic anaerobic digestion conditions previously it has been shown that microbial communities are more diverse in mesophilic ad reactors which provide a larger number of parallel pathways for each metabolism step which is beneficial for the system to adapt to environmental pressures and maintain stability niu et al 2015 therefore the temperature mode of the sta system makes it more inclined to form a highly diverse microbial community structure and ensures a stable operating system meanwhile hydrolytic and acidified bacteria in highly diverse microbial communities are highly dynamic and rely on redundancy to maintain overall community function li et al 2018a these results indicate that heat stimulation with the side stream heating in the sta setup maintains stability for the system and enhances the buffer capacity of the reactor additionally it was sufficient to produce similar effects as thermophilic anaerobic digestion which significantly enhanced the transformation of organic matter and further promoted methane production efficiency 3 2 key enzymes in the complex network of anaerobic digestion microorganisms participate in many interactions such as competition symbiosis and metabolism which are driven by microbial enzymes enzymes are active proteins that are the most intuitive marker for organic matter degradation functional expression and microbial activity in anaerobic digestion therefore it is necessary to identify active microorganisms and metabolic processes at the enzymatic level to understand the sta s mechanism fig 3 illustrates the normalized abundance of several key enzymes amylase and α glucosidase are the main enzymes involved in the solubilization and hydrolysis of organic matter together they are responsible for breaking down carbohydrate chains such as starch and glycogen into small pieces that are further broken down to release glucose li et al 2018b compared with sd sta increased the expression of these two enzymes which supports the high level of organic transformation in ad the expression of these enzymes may also be attributed to heating previously wang et al 2010 also reported that the optimal reaction temperature that releases large amounts of cell free amylase was 55 c this result would also explain why the tc had higher enzyme expressions in the acid production stage acetate kinase ak butyrate kinase and phosphotransacetylase transform the polysaccharides and amino acids into short chain fatty acids after hydrolysis ak is the key enzyme in converting vfa especially propionate into acetate which the sta system enhances this enhancement is consistent with the vfa consumption trend observed in figure s4 these hydrolytic acidification enzyme trends have also been found in previous studies wang et al 2022b observed that thermophilic ad promoted the activities of key enzymes during hydrolysis by enhancing the electron transfer capacity for methane production acetoclastic and hydrotropic methane are the two major types that use acidification products like acetate and h2 co2 to produce methane respectively the enhancement of ak activity in the sta also positively impacts acetoclastic methanogenesis metabolism specifically f420 is the key enzyme for hydrotropic methanogenesis that provides electrons to activate co2 reduction vitt et al 2014 f420 was found to be increased in the sta system second only to ak which implies that the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway probably dominates after sta treatment additionally mcra was observed to be increased and its expression level was much higher than that of other key enzymes the type iv methyl directed restriction enzyme ecokmcra is the key enzyme that catalyzes the final step of methane production and is an ideal indicator for methane production performance casanas et al 2015 therefore sta may comprehensively promote various methanogenic processes and synergistically improve the conversion efficiency of substrates to methane when exposed to heat and other environmental pressures microorganisms use heat shock proteins hsps to interact with various cellular proteins as endogenous regulators to resist adverse effects garrido et al 2001 compared with the sd system the abundance of hsps in sta increased but it was far lower than that in the tc therefore the sta system may have suffered from limited heating stimulation it is possible to mobilize the hsps mechanism and use the microbial physiological compensation mechanism to maintain the stability of the sta system 3 3 microbial community and kegg pathway this work used metaproteomics to compare sequence data to the nr non redundant protein sequence database database to identify the microorganisms within each digester to obtain key functional microorganisms that enhance anaerobic digestion performance figure 4 a and table s2 show the major phyla and genera identified with relative abundances greater than 1 at the phylum level the dominant phyla for the sta and sd systems were firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobacteria thermotogae and euryarchaeota there was no significant difference in the proportions of the five phyla p 0 05 the microbial community in the sta system showed a very similar structure to the mesophilic ad system sd among them the first four phyla were functional bacteria that dominate hydrolytic acidification processes and can be subdivided into many species at the genus level ariesyady et al 2007 firmicutes is the most abundant bacteria in anaerobic digester and their dominant are the index of ad stability actinobacteria has a similar function to bacteroidetes and produces a variety of lyases involving the degradation of complex organic compounds and the utilization of vfa alalawy et al 2021 their high abundance ensures organic metabolism in the sta system and continuously provides substrates for subsequent methane production chloroflexi and spirochaetes make up a small proportion of the sta but their abundances are significantly higher than in the sd and tc systems metaproteomics data shows that these two microorganisms contribute key enzymes in multiple metabolic pathways figure s6 for example spirochaetes can be used as syntrophic primary degraders to establish symbiotic relationships with hydrogenotrophic methanogenic consumers which promote the degradation of organic matter and maintain a low partial pressure of h2 beraud martinez et al 2021 additionally chloroflexi has established physiological diversity and can use organic acids such as acetate and propionate klatt et al 2013 therefore their metabolic flexibility helps to provide additional promotion and colonization in the unique sta system environment at the genus level the distribution of dominant genera changed in the sta system among the bacterial genera sd had a variety of dominant bacterial genera with high abundance but the dominant bacteria of sta were more concentrated fig 4a the abundance of u o clostridiales decreased significantly while the proportions of active genera increased including u o bacteroidales and u p chloroflexi figure s6 and table s3 show metaproteomic results for functional proteins in these microorganisms among them u o bacteroidales which belongs to bacteroidetes significantly up regulated functional proteins after the sta treatments many of these proteins were mainly involved in signaling and cellular processes genetic information processing amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism table s3 together this data suggests that the sta treatment may play a role in how bacteria participate in cellular processes and other functions which may be beneficial to balance the hydrolytic acidification process in a thermophilic environment and maintain cell activity in addition the abundance of syntrophic oxidation bacteria u f syntrophomonadaceae and u p spirochaetes oxidize butyrate and propionate to produce acetate was shown to increase in sta nelson et al 2011 heating makes acetogenic conversions easier kim et al 2018 and limited heating in sta promotes the activities of these microorganisms further these active genera were all found to increase heat resistance parameters brought about by hsps and the stability made them more competitive than the other hydrolytic or acidic bacteria previous reports have also observed this result since heating makes organics more accessible for microorganisms and enriches thermophilic hydrolytic acidification bacteria climent et al 2007 zverlov et al 2010 however the sta system could not form high temperature conditions suitable for thermophilic anaerobic digestion and the relative abundance of the typical thermophilic hydrolytic bacterium defluviitoga was not significantly changed overall sta adjusted several of the dominant bacteria demonstrating the predominance involved in energy conservation organic metabolism and resistance to environmental stresses archaea within the sta system were found to have obvious changes compared to the sd system and were highly similar to the tc system this study showed that methanogenic archaea were more sensitive to heating than fermentation bacteria and the side stream heating in the sta system mainly regulated the methanogenic process compared to the sd system the abundance of methanosarcina in the sta significantly increased becoming the most dominant archaea previously it has been reported that methanosarcina generally lives in mesophilic or moderately thermophilic conditions and even with robust impairments can accommodate anaerobic digestion at 15 70 c de vrieze et al 2012 in comparison other archaea are usually inhibited by thermal damage which allows methanosarcina to occupy more niches this behavior may be the reason why methanosarcina was dramatically enriched in sta because methanosarcina can use many substrates such as acetate h2 co2 or methyl compounds it is unclear which major methanogenic pathway is used in the sta which needs to be explored further the relative abundance of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacterium and methanoculleus also increased however the abundance of methanothrix an obligate acetotrophic methanogen significantly decreased together methanobacterium and methanoculleus could work in syntropy with syntrophic oxidizing bacteria to generate methane xu et al 2021 which increased in the sta system and may be involved in the biotransformation of propionate to acetate additionally the expression of proteins identified in the three digesters was compared pairwise proteins with fc fold change values greater than 1 5 or less than 0 67 were considered differentially expressed proteins deps described in table s4 principal component analysis pca was performed on the proteins identified in the three digesters sta sd and tc functional proteins were separated figure s7 these trends imply that the sta system formed a metabolic pattern different from traditional mesophilic or thermophilic anaerobic digestion the kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database was used to annotate proteins and the 25 key kegg pathways with high degrees of deps enrichment were manually selected in the three comparison schemes these pathways mainly include carbohydrate metabolism amino acid metabolism energy metabolism and other modules fig 4b the distribution of deps was highly unified across the three comparison schemes but the number in sta and sd was significantly lower than that in the other two groups furthermore a visual volcano diagram of the deps was drawn to distinguish the proteins whose expression levels were up regulated and down regulated at different significant levels figure s8 the results were similar the number of deps in the sta and sd comparison was the least and they showed the lowest expression levels with the other digesters furthermore these up regulated proteins up deps outnumbered the down regulated proteins down deps these results showed that the sta and sd systems were the most similar in actual metabolic functionality and that heating mainly enhanced the expression of functional proteins in sta this verified the up regulation of key enzymes fig 3 among these pathways carbohydrate metabolism was expressed more than amino acid metabolism which is consistent with the results shown in fig 2 glycolysis pyruvate metabolism and vfa metabolism were visibly regulated constituting the main steps of organic matter utilization and providing available substrate acetate for methanogens methane metabolism is a strongly and differentially expressed module consistent with the significant changes in methanogens and increased methanogenic performance in the sta the amount of deps in methane metabolism is greater than in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism and the enzymes related to methanogenesis were also significantly expressed more than others fig 3 as a result sta may be the dominant process controlling the methanogenesis pathway moreover functional proteins from other metabolisms such as abc transporter quorum sensing and ribosome module proteins were found to be differentially expressed classically abc transporters are associated with important functions such as protein transport and atp transfer ribosomes are associated with protein synthesis and they are central to microbial activity and functional protein expression kang et al 2021 together these pathways were effectively regulated to facilitate microbial resistance to environmental stressors and promote dna repair in the sta system at high temperatures 3 4 metaproteomics analysis 3 4 1 carbohydrate metabolism metaproteomic analysis was used to analyze the deps sta and sd involved in the transformation and utilization of carbohydrates in sta to define the regulatory role of sta on the substrate conversion process information on the key enzymes in these metabolic processes is listed in table s5 1 and fig 5 figure 5 illustrates that the key enzymes in glycolysis were up regulated and that microorganisms use stored glycogen through glycolysis to obtain supplementary acetyl coa adenosine triphosphate atp and reducing ability the most critical enzyme fructose 1 6 bisphosphate aldolase fba was specifically up regulated with an fc as high as 38 13 because fba occupies a central position in glycolysis a strong increase in fba activity may help generate additional atp to promote atp dependent processes patipong et al 2019 such as protein degradation that hsps regulate fba was also found to form a temperature dependent protein complex with hsps meng et al 2009 implying that hsps also regulated expression indeed many hsps were differentially up regulated in sta which is required for cell growth or survival at higher temperatures see section 3 4 4 in addition gapdh and tpi are two more deps that were significantly increased in sta together with fba they act as the up stream and down stream links to ga 3 p a key glycolysis node gapdh has a variety of functions with glycolysis being the most prominent it provides additional support for essential functions associated with microbial activity such as transcription signal transduction and membrane transport sirover 2011 additionally gapdh is in charge of the additional oxidation of ga 3 p which forms nadp and h and serves as the primary rate limiting step in glycolysis van den bossche et al 2017 tpi participates in the conversion of glycerone p to ga 3 p together the significant up regulation of these key enzymes correlates to increased glucose uptake glycolytic flux and carbohydrate metabolism these processes will ultimately produce a high level of atp and excess carbon that can be used as building blocks for the rapid proliferation and de novo generation of nucleotides lipids and proteins viola et al 2019 additionally intermediate metabolites from glycolysis act as important substrates for the pentose phosphate pathway ppp the key enzymes in most steps of ppp were also up regulated and fructose 6 phosphate aldolase fpa showed the highest expression fpa participates in multiple transformation processes for the non oxidative ppp and is beneficial to maintaining the flux balance of ppp the metabolites of non oxidized ppp can be reversibly oriented to form an intermediate in glycolysis and carbon is shunted through glycolysis via an erythrose 4 phosphate intermediate stincone et al 2015 therefore increased ppp in sta was beneficial for glycolysis ppp is also a significant source of nadph which is the key hydrogen donor for various biochemical reactions in microorganisms the regulation of ppp in sta was beneficial to retain intracellular redox balance that enhances stress resistance for microorganisms lin et al 2018 moreno et al 2021 tao et al 2022 furthermore pyruvate a byproduct of glycolysis can link serine metabolism and be further oxidized to acetyl coa which por and kor drive the central key biomolecules in carbohydrate lipid and amino acid catabolism moffett et al 2020 por and kor were significantly up regulated in sta which benefits the circulation of glycolysis produced substances and initiates fatty acid metabolism enzymes in two steps of the tca cycle in sta were observed to be significantly up regulated sdh hub linking oxidative phosphorylation to electron transport and enzymes in the reversible transformation of succinyl coa to 2 oxoglutarate the products of these enzymatically driven reactions are associated with amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism which may promote fatty acid oxidation previously another study that explored thermophilic anaerobic co digestion also found that the tca cycle enhanced the biosynthesis of amino acids and acetyl coa zhang et al 2023 therefore sta regulates the tca cycle and affects microbial metabolism the syntrophic oxidation bacteria that can alleviate vfa accumulation including u p chloroflexi u f syntrophomonadaceae defluviitoga acetomicrobium and u f synergistaceae have been observed in sta they can drive propionate and butyrate degradation through conventional methylmalonyl coa and β oxidation pathways and finally form acetate enzymes that act as major steps in propionate and butonate metabolism were observed to be significantly upregulated in particular acka and pta which are important in propionyl coenzyme a synthesis were highly expressed and significantly up regulated the expression of these key enzymes promotes the consumption of vfa especially propionate which is consistent with the results in fig s4 in addition the carboxylation of propionyl coa and the formation of butyryl coa and its subsequent conversion to acetate by acetyl coa synthetase can release atp hao et al 2020 promoting these key enzymes in sta is beneficial for anaerobic digestion s energy metabolism balance acetate can be further oxidized by syntropic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob key enzymes in the reversed wood ljungdahl pathway were correspondingly up regulated especially the subunit cdhcde acse in the bifunctional complex codh acs which catalyzes the transfer of the methyl moiety bound to tetrahydrofolate adam et al 2018 saob completes the conversion of co2 and acetate opposite to the reductive acetyl coa pathway generally speaking sao relies on energy sharing with hydrogenotrophic methanogens hattori 2008 because its standard free energy δg0 is 104 6 kj mol its growth is slow due to its energy disadvantage however at high temperatures sao becomes more thermodynamically favorable dolfing 2014 the abundance of thermophilic and heat resistant saob was found to be increased in sta as well including u f anaerolineaceae u f syntrophomonadaceae and u f synergistaceae this breakthrough in thermodynamic limitation also promoted vfa interconversion and hydrotropic methanogenesis processes in the sao reaction chain from these metaproteomic comparisons it is worth noting that the proteins that were specifically up regulated in these pathways usually act on key or rate limiting steps even though their total expression with their deps was reduced finally sta may inhibit microorganisms sensitive to higher temperatures by weakening unnecessary steps and concentrating energy and carbon on key functions for these microorganisms thus the sta has a favorable impact on functional microorganisms and key enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism 3 4 2 amino acid metabolism under the influence of microorganisms proteins typically break down into amino acids and peptides amino acids can undergo further degradation through deamination resulting in ammonia nitrogen formation wu et al 2021 the information on deps related to major amino acid metabolism in sta was identified and the active enzymes key microorganisms and specific metabolic pathways were analyzed table s5 2 fig 6 glycine serine and threonine metabolism are the most differentially expressed modules and they were higher than other amino acid metabolism pathways usually serine glycine and cysteine are synthesized through the 3 phosphoglycolate pathway carried out through a series of phosphorylated intermediates among them the key enzymes sera serc and serb regulate the synthesis and metabolism of the serine family and are linked to glycolysis the thermotolerant bacteria u p chloroflexi and the thermophilic bacteria defluviitoga significantly up regulated these enzymes it is worth noting that sera is the rate limiting enzyme in serine synthesis and is also essential for protein synthesis and cell growth wang et al 2022a its remarkable expression in the sta system means it specifically regulates the restriction step in the phosphorylation pathway with the other proteins serc is known to be temperature responsive and it s been previously shown that its transcription levels can be down regulated under high temperature stress wang et al 2013 however the expression of serc in sta increased which benefited from the dominant genus u p chloroflexi and the expression of serb from the thermophilic genus defluviitoga was also significantly increased in addition serine can also be derived from glycine which is formed from glyoxylate through transamination the increase of shmt and agxt the key enzymes in this reversible process is beneficial for regulating serine family proteins and synthesizing necessary precursors of various cell proliferation related biomolecules yoshida et al 2004 for instance glycine contributes carbon and nitrogen to the biosynthesis of purines porphyrins and other metabolites serine is a branch node that is central to cysteine and methionine metabolism the expression of cysk the key enzyme involved in cysteine synthesis by serine was up regulated as was that of aspb and tst which are critical for cysteine deamination in addition to catalyzing the degradation of cysteine to produce pyruvate aspb may also be important for the biosynthesis of coenzyme m in methanogens cysteine deamination can produce sulfopyruvate an enzyme in the coenzyme m synthesis pathway that has not been found to be differentially expressed in methanogens helgadóttir et al 2007 therefore the regulation of amino acid metabolism by the sta system may also be beneficial for enhancing methane production sta showed the highest expression of deps in the alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism pathways the key enzymes that catalyze the metabolism of aspartate and glutamate pyridoxal phosphate plp dependent and glutamate dehydrogenase gdh were significantly up regulated in sta they regulate the production of oxaloacetate and 2 oxoglutarate in the tca cycle and then succinate is produced via 2 oxoacid ferredoxin oxidoreductase subunit gamma and 2 oxoacid acceptor oxidoreductase subunit alpha bruscalupi et al 2023 mueser et al 2020 therefore the regulation of alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism in the sta system may be the main reason for the specific up regulation of the related steps observed in the tca cycle fig 5 in addition glutamine is the primary nitrogen donor for protein and nucleotide synthesis and is essential for cell proliferation wise and thompson 2010 alanine can be deaminated and converted into pyruvate by the alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase family of proteins both of them play an important role in carbohydrate metabolism in sta the total amount of deps was less than carbohydrate metabolism meaning that sta less strongly regulates amino acid metabolism and retains more of the original mesophilic bacteria at the same time the key enzymes provided by the thermophilic and thermotolerant microorganisms show high activity that participates in the rate limiting step of amino acid metabolism and plays important auxiliary functions in cell proliferation methane metabolism and the tca cycle 3 4 3 methane metabolism the distribution of deps in the methane metabolism pathway and the metabolic functions in which enzymes participate were analyzed fig 7 and figure s9 related information about deps can be seen in table s5 3 and table s6 the pathways of methane production can be divided into three types based on the type of substrate methylotrophic methanogenesis m00356 acetoclastic methanogenesis m00357 and hydrotropic methanogenesis m00567 the results show that all three pathways are obviously enhanced and most of the enzymes were highly expressed after sta regulation so the balance among them improves the performance of the reactor in addition down regulated deps were mainly from methanothrix while up regulated deps were mainly from methanosarcina consistent with the archaeal community structure changes fig 4a the expression of enzymes in the methylotrophic methanogenesis pathway was relatively small in sta which suggests that their contribution to methane production might be negligible acetoclastic methanogenesis am and hydrotropic methanogenesis hm pathways are the main modes of methane production in anaerobic digestion it is reported that the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway is strongly inhibited by high temperature anaerobic digestion and that hydrotropic methanogenesis can increase as the temperature changes from 37 to 55 c pap et al 2015 the results with the tc system show that acetoclastic methanogenesis greatly weakened while the hydrotropic methanogenesis pathway mostly dominated table s6 however there were differences between these pathways in the sta system specifically deps in the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway were significantly increased and were higher than in other methane production pathways although the obligate acetoclastic methanogen methanothrix was inhibited in the sta system the facultative methanogen methanosarcina demonstrated high tolerance and was significantly up regulated among these the fc values of co dehydrogenase acetyl coa synthetase cdhcde acetate kinase acka and phosphate acetyltransferase pta in methanosarcina were 5 86 5 4 and 3 06 respectively together they facilitated acetate utilization by the methanogens various energy conversion hydrogenases in the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway were also significantly up regulated the expression of the ech hydrogenase ech complex subunits abcdef for example was significantly up regulated in sta and the subunits were from the same microorganism methanosarcina implying the purification of specific functions ech contributed to energy conservation by coupling reduced ferredoxin fd oxidation with proton reduction which may be another reason for the promotion of acetoclastic methanogenesis katsyv and muller 2022 because the methanogenesis process with multiple energy conversion systems saves energy it is beneficial to meet the energy demand of regulating proton balance and supplementing h when cells are exposed to high temperatures wang et al 2022c welte et al 2010 in addition in fermentation ech can release supernumerary electrons during acetate and co2 production by reducing h to h2 maintaining the redox balance required for the metabolism of cellular functions schoelmerich and muller 2020 soboh et al 2004 in the hydrotropic methanogenesis pathway the expression of eha and ehb which have similar functions to ech was not enhanced but the homologous ni fe hydrogenase cytochrome f420 reducing hydrogenases frhabg were significantly up regulated frh donates electrons to reduce com s s cob which is essential to the hydrogenotrophic pathway but has a dispensable role in the methylotrophic pathway in addition frh can establish a membrane bound electron transport chain with vht and hdr as the reduction end points of com s s cob that generates ionic power and produces atp by atp synthase kulkarni et al 2009 in addition almost all subunits of the v a type atpase were up regulated or expressed in large quantities v a type atpase is a proton pump that generates a proton gradient to provide proton power for transmembrane transport drory and nelson 2006 the v a type atpase in methanosarcina may be responsible for proton pumping atpases to participate in atp synthesis and meet the cell s atp dependence physiological needs sekiya 2022 these key enzymes were highly expressed and greatly increased which may be another important energy conservation mechanism for archaea in sta it was observed that obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogens provided a large number of functional proteins about hm with enhanced expression which explained the proliferation of methanobacterium and methanoculleus according to previous research the relative abundance of hydrotropic methanogens is the limiting factor in the co culture bioaugmentation process in sao and hm fotidis et al 2013 in sta increased saob methanobacterium and methanoculleus jointly promoted the hydrotropic methanogenesis pathway generally speaking acetoclastic methanogens and syntrophic partners saob hydrogenotrophic methanogens compete for acetate through cross feeding hattori 2008 so it is worth paying attention to the balance between two methanogenic pathways in sta in fact the expression of specific enzymes for hydrotropic methanogenesis was relatively low compared to acetoclastic methanogenesis and the promotion of active enzymes for hydrotropic methanogenesis is incomplete even though one deps in hm had a higher fc value 11 6 therefore it is possible that heating in sta promotes both hm and am however the enhancement of hm may be unstable and unbalanced at the same time the significantly enhanced energy conservation mechanism in methanogens reduces the environmental pressure on both pathways which is beneficial to the balance of the two methane production routes 3 4 4 hsps and heat shock different microbial communities were formed in thermophilic and mesophilic anaerobic digestion fig 4a and the slurry circulation in sta promoted the interaction between these two microbial communities together this may created a new microbial coexistence mode in sta and improved its performance hsps play an important role in overcoming heat shock hs and improving microorganisms adaptability to temperature changes hsps can form complexes with other proteins that prevent proteins from aggregating and undergoing thermal denaturation ensuring the cell s normal function at high temperatures ji et al 2019 figure s10 and table s5 4 demonstrate the identification and analysis of deps expression in relation to hsps table s5 shows that compared to sd there is a significant increase in the total expression of deps related to hsps in sta including dnaj dnak groes groel and hsp20 most of the up deps were related to microorganisms that showed increased relative abundance in sta and they were also highly coincident with key microorganisms that lead to the specific enhancement of key enzymes in metabolism these results show that sta can improve heat resistance in the dominant genera and increase metabolic function hsp molecular chaperones usually work together during heat shock regulation richter et al 2010 and their interaction with dominant microorganisms is highly correlated to functional protein activity for example although the relative abundance of the thermophilic bacteria thermotogae in sta did not increase it provided the largest increase fc 39 7 and the highest expression level of hsps which could help other microorganisms overcome hs among these hsps hsp20 is the dep with the largest up regulation and expression which is the main family of hsps and may play a key role in the heat resistance of sta hsp20 prevents protein denaturation and keeps proteins in a folding competent state and they can participate in atp dependent disaggregation through the hsp70 90 chaperone system park and seo 2015 actinobacteria and methanosarcina were the main groups that harbored hsp20 sequences dnak the bacterial hsp70 homolog was significantly up regulated it is an important component of the cellular chaperone network and atp hydrolysis regulates its expression qiu et al 2006 as a result the significant up regulation may benefit from sta regulated energy metabolism dnaj hsp40 was also promoted because of the high temperature stimulation in sta it acts as a multifunctional protein that combines with partner dnak hsp70 the specific expression of dnaj is beneficial for atp hydrolysis and regulates the functional activity of dnak takayama et al 1999 groel and groes were a group of highly expressed chaperones groel is a bacterial homolog of hsp60 and groes usually modulates groel s atpase activity mathew and morimoto 1998 in prokaryotes groel and dnaj jointly regulate the atpase activity of dnak and promote the effective release of nucleotides among these deps methanosarcina had the most up deps zhang et al 2006 discovered that when methanogens were exposed to an hour of heat shock the hsp70 and hsp60 systems were up regulated the findings suggest that methanosarcina may be the dominant microorganism in sta resistant to heat shock in addition heat shock proteins participate in several important processes related to growth including protein folding refolding assembly translocation degradation and their transport through cell membranes for example dnaj hsp 40 is essential for folding and refolding proteins correct folding and assembly of the newly translated polypeptides are required for functional protein formation and maintenance qiu et al 2006 hsp70 and hsp40 families are also found to associate with ribosomes in the ribosome mrna is translated into linear polypeptides which play an important role in regulating the activity of functional proteins hundley et al 2002 therefore the specific up regulation of these heat shock proteins is beneficial for expressing other active proteins this up regulation means that the hsps promoted by heating in sta can help the physiological regulation of microorganisms in all aspects which may be an important reason for sta s excellent performance 3 4 5 overall summary the sta system created a unique strategy of combining thermophilic anaerobic digestion with mesophilic anaerobic digestion which enhanced the resistance of the ad system to environmental pressures and ensured stability with high level metabolism the microbial community structure had changed adaptively forming a microbial community with more metabolic advantages and physiological diversity promoting the functional activities of key enzymes and greatly improving the conversion efficiency of organic matter with better methane production performance fig 8 specifically sludge circulation and heating in the side stream reactor of sta activated the expression of hsp molecular chaperone prevented protein degeneration improved the heat resistance of dominant bacteria and maintained the physiological activity of microorganisms further sta concentrated and evolved dominant genera of bacteria and enriched a large number of dominant archaea especially methanosarcina functional microorganisms proliferated and established a close co culture relationship and sta showed better energy strategies and metabolic patterns with metabolism sta promoted the rate limiting steps in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism the hydrolysis acidification process and the transformation of intermediate metabolites which releases energy and plays a positive role in other metabolism and cell metabolic support function the methane metabolism was strongly promoted and stronger than other organic matter metabolism modules among them acetoclastic methanogenesis and hydrotropic methanogenesis pathways were enhanced to different degrees with the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway dominating the multiple energy conservation mechanisms of methanosarcina promoted a balance between the acetoclastic methanogenesis and hydrotropic methanogenesis pathways coupled with syntrophic acetate oxidizing facilitating the system s efficient operation meanwhile compared to conventional thermophilic anaerobic digestion sta presented low energy and operating costs and possessed a richer microbial community structure and cellular stability which can take full advantage of the material conversion promoted by heating maintain the system s stability and produce excellent digestive performance concisely anaerobic digestion based on sta is a promising strategy for improving the quality and efficiency of conventional anaerobic digestion 4 conclusions sta is a promising strategy for anaerobic digestion to enhance methanogenic performance and improve the stability of thermophilic anaerobic digestion of easily hydrolyzed substrates through cycling sta promotes hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis processes with high levels of metabolic activities the limited heating in the side stream reactor made the conversion of scfa to acetate occur more easily which facilitated the consumption of vfa and improved the enzymatic activity of metabolic links sta established a strong microbial community structure and effectively maintained system stability methanogenic pathways were promoted in different degrees with acetoclastic methanogenesis being the most dominant in addition sta effectively controlled the negative effects of thermal stimulation and helped the multifunctional methanosarcina to occupy most of the ecological niches declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing interests or
