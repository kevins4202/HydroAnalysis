22830,this paper concerns the prediction of the power outputs of wave energy converters wecs operating in shallow water nonlinear waves the bottom effects on the power performances of wecs a phenomenon that has always been overlooked by the previous researchers have been taken into account during the calculations using an oscillating surge wave energy converter oswec as an example it is demonstrated in this article that for each sea state using linearly simulated waves without bottom effects as inputs in the simulation will always predict the oswec s power output more than 200 higher than the result predicted by inputting nonlinearly simulated waves with bottom effects therefore nonlinear simulated waves with bottom effects should instead be utilized as inputs in the simulation process in order to further improve the simulation efficiency a novel transformed linear simulation method is first proposed in this paper for generating equivalent waves as those obtained from the nonlinear simulation method further calculation examples show that the relative error of the predicted power output value when inputting transformed linearly simulated waves is always less than or equal to 1 97 keywords power output wave energy converters bottom effects nonlinear simulation transformed linear simulation abbreviations wec wave energy converter oswec oscillating surge wave energy

a kind of reliable and renewable energy and the worldwide wave energy resource potential is enormous the global wave power potential has been estimated to be around 8000 80000 twh y 1 10 tw which is in the same order of magnitude of the world electrical energy consumption fresco and traverso 2014 the interest in exploiting wave energy from the world oceans has been growing rapidly in recent years and various kinds of wecs have been or are being developed in europe u s a and other parts of the world see e g fresco and traverso 2014 yu et al 2014a b fan et al 2016 for the successful design and analysis of a wec realistically describing the ocean wave environment in which the wec will operate is of the utmost importance unfortunately in the present literature a wec s power outputs prediction is almost always performed by assuming that the wec is operating in linear irregular waves see e g the publications anderlini et al 2018 cargo et al 2014 dai et al 2017 eriksson et al 2005 fan et al 2016 fernandes and fonseca 2013 gomes et al 2015 herber and allison 2013 sánchez et al 2015 stelzer and joshi 2012 wang and isberg 2015 yu et al 2014a b zhang et al 2017 however the linear irregular wave model can only produce ideal waves with crest trough symmetries and this model is only suitable to approximately describe irregular waves in very deep sea and from a very moderate sea state in reality however when deep water waves become too steep or as the water depth decrease the waves will become statistically asymmetric i e the wave crests will become higher and sharper and the wave troughs will become shallower and flatter wang 2014 2018 this is called the crest trough asymmetry in the ocean engineering literature and the resulting waves are usually called nonlinear random waves alamian et al 2017 and folley et al 2007 had demonstrated in their studies that the shallow water depth effects on the performances of wecs can not be ignored in the performance analysis of a wec stelzer and joshi 2012 stated that an implicit assumption being made is that the energy converters are not placed in shallow waters since nonlinear wave theory may become more appropriate under such conditions from this statement it can be obviously found that the nonlinear wave theory should be applied in the performance analysis of wecs placed in shallow waters as stated in fernandes and fonseca 2013 most of the proposed wecs will be installed in shallow sea areas with water depths less than 90 m obviously the nonlinear random model should be used to simulate the shallow water waves as the inputs in the design analysis and optimization of most of the today s wecs however to the best knowledge of the author of this article in the current literature there are only two papers wang and wang 2018 wang 2018 in which the nonlinear random model has been used to simulate the shallow water waves as the inputs in the performance analysis of wecs a distinct disadvantage of the nonlinear random wave simulation model in the aforementioned two papers is that it is very time consuming furthermore the bottom effects on the power performances of wecs had not been taken into account in the aforementioned two papers it is well known that in a shallow water area the wave energy will be dissipated due to the existence of a bottom boundary layer therefore the calculation results in the aforementioned two papers obtained using nonlinearly simulated waves without bottom effects as simulation inputs can never be deemed reliable motivated by the above mentioned facts in this paper the power outputs of an oswec oscillating surge wave energy converter in a realistic second order nonlinear random sea will be rigorously predicted by a second order nonlinear simulation method the bottom effects on the power performances of the wec will be taken into account during the calculations in order to further improve the simulation efficiency a novel transformed linear simulation method will be first proposed in this paper for generating equivalent waves as those obtained from the second order nonlinear simulation method the accuracy and efficiency of the novel transformed linear simulation method will be substantiated through the subsequent calculation examples in this article the remainder of the paper will be organized in six sections in section 2 the theoretical background of the second order nonlinear random sea waves is given in section 3 we present the theories and derivations of the proposed transformed linear simulation method in section 4 the equations for the time domain simulation of a wec are elucidated in section 5 the calculation examples prediction results and discussions are presented with concluding remarks summarized in section 6 2 the second order nonlinear random sea waves waves in an idealized linear gaussian random sea have crest trough symmetry however it is known that waves in the real sea are nonlinear and the ocean surface elevation process deviates from the gaussian assumption i e the wave crests are becoming steeper and higher and the wave troughs are becoming flatter and shallower than expected under the gaussian assumption in the following we briefly introduce the theories of the second order nonlinear random sea waves the free surface elevation for an irregular sea state with a constant water depth d is denoted by η x t in which x is the longitudinal coordinate and t is time assuming this irregular sea state is characterized by a specific wave spectrum s η ω in which ω denotes the angular frequency then the first order linear solution for η x t can be expressed as follows see e g toffoli et al 2006 1 η 1 x t re n 0 n c n exp i ω n t k n x ε n as n tends to infinity in equation 1 re denotes the real part of the complex number and for each elementary cosine wave c n denotes its complex valued amplitude which is directly related to the specific wave spectrum s η ω by the relation e c n 2 s η ω n δ ω in equation 1 i denotes the imaginary unit ω n is the radian frequency and ω n n δ ω n ω c n and ω c is the upper cut off frequency beyond which the wave spectrum s η ω may be assumed to be zero for either mathematical or physical reasons k n is the wave number and ε n is the phase angle uniformly distributed in the interval 0 2 π furthermore the individual frequencies ω n and wave numbers k n in equation 1 are functionally related through the following dispersion relation 2 ω n 2 g k n tanh k n d where g is the gravitational acceleration and d is the water depth the traditional linear simulation method in the ocean engineering practice is to numerically implement equations 1 and 2 to generate the first order linear gaussian wave time histories at a specific location of the sea however waves in the real sea are nonlinear and non gaussian therefore the linear gaussian sea model as expressed in equations 1 and 2 should be corrected by including second order quadratic terms following langley 1987 and hasselmann 1962 the second order quadratic corrections are given by 3 η 2 x t re m 0 n n 0 n c m c n r m exp i ω m t k m x ε m ω n t k n x ε n q m exp i ω m t k m x ε m ω n t k n x ε n in the above equation r m and q m are called second order quadratic transfer functions the quadratic transfer functions r m and q m are given by 4 r m n 1 g 1 4 ω m ω n 2 ω m ω n ω n 2 ω m 2 k n k m g 2 ω n ω m 4 g 2 k m 2 ω m ω n 4 g 2 k n 2 ω m ω n 2 cosh k m k n d g k m k n sinh k m k n d ω m ω n cosh k m k n d 1 4 g ω m ω n k m k n g 2 ω n 2 ω m 2 1 4 g ω m 2 ω n 2 5 q m n 1 g 1 4 ω m ω n 2 ω m ω n ω n 2 ω m 2 k n k m g 2 ω n ω m 4 g 2 k m 2 ω m ω n 4 g 2 k n 2 ω n ω m 2 cosh k m k n d g k n k m sinh k n k m d ω n ω m cosh k n k m d 1 4 g ω m ω n k m k n g 2 ω n 2 ω m 2 1 4 g ω m 2 ω n 2 in the above two equations the wave numbers k n and frequencies ω n satisfy the same relation as in the linear case finally by combining equations 1 and 3 the wave surface elevations for the nonlinear random ocean waves can be written as 6 η x t η 1 x t η 2 x t re n 0 n c n exp i ω n t k n x ε n re m 0 n n 0 n c m c n r m n exp i ω m t k m x ε m ω n t k n x ε n q m n exp i ω m t k m x ε m ω n t k n x ε n the traditional nonlinear simulation method in the ocean engineering practice is to numerically implement equations 6 and 2 to generate the nonlinear wave time histories at a specific location of the sea for the numerical implementation of the nonlinear simulation the problem is usually divided into two processes i e first generating the first order linear gaussian time histories with a specific wave spectrum at a specific location for each of these the numerical algorithm then evaluating the full set of second order corrections according to the hydrodynamic theory as specified in this section therefore the first order wave process with n components at frequencies ω n gives rise to a total of n 2 corrections spreading over all sum frequencies at frequencies ω n ω m and to another n 2 corrections over all difference frequencies ω n ω m however the nonlinear simulation method as explained above will become very time consuming when n becomes large in order to overcome this drawback a novel transformed linear simulation method will first be proposed in this paper for generating equivalent waves as those obtained from the nonlinear simulation method and in the next section the theoretical background of this method will be elucidated 3 the proposed transformed linear simulation method our proposed transformed linear simulation method is an alternative and faster method than including the second order correction terms to the linear model it will use a deterministic and time instantaneous functional transformation the non gaussian wave elevation process η x t is then a function of a single gaussian process η x t 7 η x t g η x t where g is a continuously differentiable function with positive derivative in the proposed transformed linear simulation method the transformation model the g function is chosen to be a monotonic exponential function calibrated such that the first three moments of the transformed model match the moments of the true process without loss of generality we set the position coordinate x in η x t to be x 0 meanwhile we also write η 0 t in a simplified way as to be η t then after a lengthy derivation process as shown in langley 1987 eq 6 in section 2 can be re written in the following matrix notation 8 η t s t x x t q r x y t q r y where q and r are real symmetric matrix whose nmth components are s n s m q m and s n s m r m respectively s is a vector whose nth components are s n s n s η ω n d ω x and y are vectors whose nth components are x n and y n respectively and x n and y n are gaussian random variables whose expressions are shown in langley 1987 by performing an eigenvalue decomposition the above equation becomes 9 η t s t x x t p 1 t λ 1 p x y t p 2 t λ 2 p 2 y where λ 1 is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of the matrix q r in the respective diagonal and p 1 contains the corresponding eigenvectors per row meanwhile λ 2 is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of the matrix q r in the respective diagonal and p 2 contains the corresponding eigenvectors per row introducing a new set of gaussian random variables z j such that 10 z p 1 0 0 p 2 x y we can then write the stochastic process η t as this is called the kac siegert solution 11 η t j 1 2 n β j z j λ j z j 2 where z j are independent gaussian processes with unit variance and β j and λ j are coefficients computed based on the information provided by the wave spectrum s η ω which is chosen for a given sea state specifically the coefficients in the above equation are computed as follows 12 β p 1 s 0 13 λ λ 1 d λ 2 d where λ i d denotes a column vector formed by the diagonal elements of λ i from the above equation we can notice that the β j coefficients are computed based on the information of s directly related to the sea spectrum and the information of p 1 furthermore p 1 is computed based on the information of q and r and q and r are computed based on the information of the sea spectrum and the wave frequency range of the specific sea spectrum therefore the β j coefficients can be computed based entirely on the information provided by the sea spectrum similarly the λ j coefficients can also be computed based entirely on the information provided by the sea spectrum for a specific nonlinear sea state η t will be a non gaussian random process here we will use the simplest model for a non gaussian sea where η t is expressed as a function of a stationary gaussian process η t with mean value μ and variance σ 2 i e we can re express equation 7 as 14 η t g η t η t ζ η t 2 d g d η 0 g 0 0 actually we shall use the function g which is the inverse of g to define the transformation instead of g and use the relation η t g η t between the real sea data η t and the stationary gaussian process η t in our research the transformation model is chosen to be a monotonic exponential function calibrated such that the first three moments of the transformed model g η t match the moments of the true process η t information about the moments of the process can be obtained by resorting to theoretical models therefore the functional relationship between η t and η t given in eq 14 is inversely presented such that the stationary gaussian process η t is expressed approximately as a function of η t as follows wang 2015 ochi 1998 15 η t 1 γ ζ 1 exp γ ζ η t where γ is a constant 1 28 for η t 0 and 3 0 otherwise in order to determine the unknown parameters ζ μ and σ 2 in the above equation we first write equation 14 as follows 16 η t ζ η t 1 2 ζ 2 1 4 ζ by equalizing the cumulant generating functions of equation 16 and equation 11 we obtain the following relationships 17 ζ σ 2 ζ μ 2 μ 0 σ 2 2 ζ 2 σ 4 j 1 2 n β j 2 2 j 1 2 n λ j 2 3 ζ σ 4 8 ζ 3 σ 6 3 j 1 2 n λ j β j 2 4 j 1 2 n λ j 3 because β j and λ j in the above three sets of equations can be computed by using equations 12 and 13 based on the wave spectrum s η η ω which is chosen for a given sea state the unknown parameters ζ μ and σ 2 can be readily obtained by solving the above three sets of equations then we can obtain the functional transformation g i e the inverse of g g 1 4 time domain simulation of a wec in the current literature the power outputs prediction of a wec is usually conducted by using the time domain simulation method i e by numerically integrating the wec motion equations to obtain the power outputs time histories the time domain vector form motion equations of a wec subjected to wave loads and other loads can be expressed as 18 m r b a x t 0 t k t τ x τ d τ p h s p w a v e t p e x t t p v i s c t in the above equation m r b is the rigid body inertia matrix a is the constant infinite frequency added mass matrix x t is a vector of linear and angular displacements p h s is a vector of the hydrostatic restoring forces and moments meanwhile in eq 18 k t is a matrix of retardation functions due to the wec s motion waves will be generated in the free surface these waves will persist at all subsequent times and affect the wec s motion this is known as the hydrodynamic memory effects and they are captured in eq 18 by the convolution integral term that is a function of x τ and the retardation functions k t on the right hand side of the equality 18 p w a v e t denote the wave excitation loads forces and moments p e x t t denote the external loads forces and moments and p v i s c t denote the viscous loads forces and moments due to the hydrodynamic viscous effects up to now the wave excitation loads p w a v e t acting on a wec are usually calculated by using linearly simulated waves without bottom effects as inputs i e by inputting free surface elevation values generated by using eq 1 as pointed out in the introduction part of this paper this is not a very accurate approach on the other hand the power output results in wang and wang 2018 predicted by using nonlinearly simulated waves without bottom effects as inputs are also not correct therefore in the present work we will calculate the wave excitation loads p w a v e t acting on a specific wec by using nonlinearly simulated waves with bottom effects as inputs in order to further improve the simulation efficiency a novel transformed linear simulation method will first be proposed in this paper for generating equivalent nonlinear waves as the inputs for calculating the wave excitation loads p w a v e t our calculation results regarding a specific oswec oscillating surge wave energy converter will be presented and discussed in the next section 5 calculation examples prediction results and discussions 5 1 the chosen oswec oscillating surge wave energy converter in this study we will demonstrate our prediction results regarding a bottom hinged oswec as shown in fig 1 modeled in wec sim wec sim is a mid fidelity matlab based open source code developed by kelley ruehl and other researchers from sandia national laboratories and national renewable energy laboratory lawson et al 2015 ruehl et al 2016a b ruehl et al 2014 ruehl et al 2016a b yu et al 2014a b wec sim has the ability to model devices that are comprised of rigid bodies joints power take off systems and mooring systems simulations are performed in the time domain by solving the governing wec equations of motion fig 2 is a schematic representation of the chosen oswec the oswec shown in fig 1 captures wave energy from the relative motion between the flap and the fixed base the base is rigidly connected to the sea bottom the flap is connected to the base through a rotational joint the vertical distance from the still water surface to the rotational joint is 8 9 m as shown in fig 2 and the vertical distance from the rotational joint to the sea bottom is 2 0 m the rotational joint contains a spring damper system that represents the pto power take off system the flap is designed to rotate against the fixed base to convert wave energy into electrical power from the relative rotational motion induced by incoming waves the full scale dimensions of the oswec and the mass properties are shown in table 1 all the dimensions and mass properties of the oswec in table 1 are given based on the experimental study of hoff 2009 at this point it should be reminded that the water depth is only 10 9 m 8 9 m 2 0 m at the site where this oswec is installed therefore the shallow water random waves at this site will obviously be nonlinear see e g the nonlinear wave theory in ochi 1998 5 2 the prediction results and discussions we have predicted the power outputs of the above mentioned oswec by time domain simulations the widely used jonswap wave frequency spectrum is adopted in the process of simulation of the irregular sea waves the mathematical expression of the infinite water depth jonswap frequency spectrum with a significant wave height h s and spectral peak frequency ω p is as follows chakrabarti 1987 19 s ω α h s 2 ω 5 ω p 4 exp 1 25 ω ω p 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 ω p 2 σ 2 where ω is the wave angular frequency rad s h s is the significant wave height of a specific sea state and γ is the spectral peakedness factor in the above equation ω p is the spectral peak angular frequency and ω p 2 π t p t p is the spectral peak period of a specific sea state meanwhile in the above equation 20 α 0 0624 0 230 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ 21 σ 0 07 f o r ω ω p 0 09 f o r ω ω p the above jonswap spectrum is an infinite water depth wave spectrum which does not taken into account the sea bottom effects it is well known that in a shallow water area the wave energy will be dissipated due to the existence of a bottom boundary layer in shallow water in order to consider the correction for the effects of bottom on the wave spectrum a corrected wave spectrum s c ω is obtained in this paper by multiplying the original standard jonswap spectrum s ω by a function φ ω d that ranges between 0 and 1 according to the similarity law of buows et al 1985 22 s c ω s ω φ ω d s ω k ω d 3 ω k ω d k ω 3 ω k ω in the above formula ω d is a dimensionless frequency defined by ω d g k and ω satisfy the same dispersion relation as shown in equation 2 in formula 22 s c ω represents the finite water depth spectrum and s ω represents the infinite water depth spectrum in fig 3 the blue curve shows an infinite water depth jonswap wave spectrum with h s 4 25 m t p 5s obtained by using equations 19 21 the green curve in fig 3 shows a finite water depth d 10 9 m jonswap wave spectrum with h s 4 25 m t p 5s obtained by using equations 19 22 because the area under the curve of a specific jonswap wave spectrum is proportional to the value of the wave energy it is obvious that the energy under the green curve spectrum in fig 3 has reduced and this reduction is caused by the energy dissipation due to the sea bottom effects similarly the red curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 also shows the significant wave energy dissipation due to the existence of a bottom boundary layer in a shallow sea with h s 6 5 m t p 14s please note that in fig 3 the black curve shows an infinite water depth jonswap wave spectrum with h s 6 5 m t p 14s obtained by using equations 19 21 we next verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed transformed linear simulation method for generating equivalent waves as those obtained from the nonlinear simulation method fig 4 shows the results of a specific calculation example for this verification purpose in fig 4 the red curve shows the simulated 140s wave time series based on the green curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 using the nonlinear simulation method i e by numerically implementing equations 6 and 2 in section 2 in fig 4 the blue curve shows the simulated 140s wave time series based on the green curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 using the proposed transformed linear simulation method i e by implementing the theories and equations in section 3 we can obviously find that the blue curve in fig 4 fit the red curve very well and this fact can fully and clearly substantiate the accuracy of our proposed transformed linear simulation method by the way we can see that in fig 4 the green curve a linearly simulated 140s wave time series based on the blue curve infinite depth jonswap spectrum in fig 3 deviates a lot from the red curve a nonlinearly simulated 140s wave time series based on the green curve finite depth jonswap spectrum in fig 3 as another verification example fig 5 shows the good fit between a red curve a nonlinearly simulated 200s wave time series and a blue curve a transformed linearly simulated 200s wave time series based on the red curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 table 2 shows the quantitative metrics regarding the simulated wave time series corresponding to the red curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 the maximum wave surface elevation under the sea state of nonlinearly simulated waves is 2 0514 m the minimum wave surface elevation under the sea state of nonlinearly simulated waves is 1 7907 m we have carried out further calculations based on the data in table 2 and found that the percentage change with respect to the maximum minimum elevation is within 10 8 by using the transformed linear simulation method in comparison to the nonlinear simulation method the aforementioned calculation results once again clearly substantiate the accuracy of our proposed transformed linear simulation method for generating equivalent waves as those obtained from the nonlinear simulation method by the way we can see that in fig 5 the green curve a linearly simulated 200s wave time series based on the black curve infinite depth jonswap spectrum in fig 3 deviates a lot from the red curve a nonlinearly simulated 200s wave time series based on the red curve finite depth jonswap spectrum in fig 3 usually for predicting the power output of a wec operating in a specific sea state a large number of wave time series should first be generated as the inputs to the subsequent wec dynamic simulation processes for example in his prediction of the power outputs of a specific wec lindgren 2015 stated that for each damp ing value 1000 wave sections were simulated each 20 min long in section 2 we have theoretically illustrated why generating nonlinear wave time histories using the traditional nonlinear simulation method is very time consuming in this section we will use a specific calculation example to demonstrate that the nonlinear simulation method is indeed inefficient we have developed a matlab computer code to numerically implement equations 6 and 2 in section 2 to generate the nonlinear wave time histories based on the red curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 using this code 1000 wave sections have been simulated each 20 min long it took 142 5s to finish generating these 1000 wave sections on a desktop computer dell vostro 230 intel core tm 2 duo cpu e7500 2 93 ghz ram 4 0 gb similarly we have also developed another computer program to carry out the proposed transformed linear simulation method i e to implement the theories and equations in section 3 this program has been utilized to generate 1000 wave sections each 20 min long based on the red curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 it took 117 5s to finish generating these 1000 wave sections on a desktop computer dell vostro 230 intel core tm 2 duo cpu e7500 2 93 ghz ram 4 0 gb comparing to the nonlinear simulation method the proposed transformed linear simulation method is about 1 2 times faster these calculation results clearly substantiate the high efficiency of our proposed transformed linear simulation method for generating equivalent waves as those obtained from the nonlinear simulation method we next show our predicted power outputs of the aforementioned oswec operating in an ideal linear random sea without bottom effects versus operating in a realistic nonlinear random sea with bottom effects table 3 shows our calculation results of the oswec power outputs under thirteen sea states with a jonswap wave spectrum with different parameters please note that except for the h s and t p values in the last row all the other h s and t p values listed in table 3 are measured h s and t p values at the 035 cdip coastal data information program station on november 1994 http cdip ucsd edu 2 3 nav historic sub data stn 035 stream p1 these calculation results have been obtained by numerically integrating the wec motion equations eq 24 in wec sim however wec sim does not has the ability of generating nonlinear random waves which are the necessary inputs for calculating the hydrodynamic wave excitation load term p w a v e t in eq 18 therefore in our research we have separately generated the nonlinear waves with bottom effects in matlab according to the theories in equations 6 and 2 in section 2 and in equation 22 in this section for example for the sea state of h s 6 5 m t p 14s and γ 1 we have generated the nonlinear waves based on the red curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 the generated nonlinear random waves time series are saved as mat files and imported into wec sim for subsequent calculations wec sim has a feature whereby the wave elevation time series no matter it is generated by the linear simulation method or the nonlinear simulation method can be read from a file mat file into wec sim and wec sim will perform a fft fast fourier transform to calculate the amplitude and phase of each wave component from which wec sim will use to compute the full wave kinematics retaining the known amplitudes and phases the wec sim hydro coefficients for excitation radiation and added mass can subsequently be calculated for comparison purpose we have also separately generated the linear random waves without bottom effects in matlab for example for the sea state of h s 6 5 m t p 14s and γ 1 we have generated the linear random waves based on the black curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 the generated linear random waves time series are also saved as mat files and imported into wec sim for subsequent calculations in fig 6 the red curve shows a simulated 1200s wave time series corresponding to the red curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 h s 6 5 m t p 14s h 10 9 m using the nonlinear simulation method in fig 6 the blue curve shows a simulated 1200s wave time series corresponding to the black curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 h s 6 5 m t p 14s h infinite depth using the linear simulation method the simulated power output p p t o is calculated by using the following equation in wec sim 23 p p t o c p t o x r e l 2 in the above equation c p t o is the damping of the pto power take off system of the wec in this example c p t o 50000000 nsm rad i e c p t o is a constant x r e l is the relative velocity between the two bodies of the wec as can be seen from the following figures fig 7 fig 8 x r e l when inputting nonlinearly simulated waves with a finite water depth is very different from the x r e l when inputting linearly simulated waves with an infinite water depth in fig 7 the red curve shows the obtained relative velocity time series between the two bodies of the wec when inputting the red curve nonlinear wave elevation time series in fig 6 into wec sim for subsequent simulation in fig 7 the black curve shows the obtained relative velocity time series between the two bodies of the wec when inputting the blue curve linear wave elevation time series in fig 6 into wec sim for subsequent simulation please note that the two curves in fig 7 all start from t 0s the wave ramp in fig 7 ends at t 50s fig 8 is a zoom in plot of fig 7 in the time interval of 40s 220s because the simulated power output p p t o is directly proportional to the second power of the relative velocity x r e l the obtained power output when inputting the red curve nonlinear wave elevation time series in fig 6 into wec sim for subsequent simulation will be much smaller than the power output when inputting the blue curve linear wave elevation time series in fig 6 into wec sim for subsequent simulation after obtaining the power outputs time series we have subsequently calculated the total power under each sea state and our calculation results are summarized in table 3 by carefully studying the calculation results in this table we can find that for each sea state using linearly simulated waves without bottom effects as inputs in the simulation will always predict the oswec power output more than 200 higher than the result predicted by inputting nonlinearly simulated waves with bottom effects for the smallest wave h s 2 00 m sea state using linearly simulated waves without bottom effects as inputs in the simulation will predict the oswec power output 346 higher than the result predicted by inputting nonlinearly simulated waves with bottom effects for the h s 6 44 m sea state using linearly simulated waves without bottom effects as inputs in the simulation will predict the oswec power output 254 higher than the result predicted by inputting nonlinearly simulated waves with bottom effects therefore nonlinearly simulated realistic waves with bottom effects should instead be utilized as inputs in the wec simulation processes finally it is pointed out once again that the power output change demonstrated in table 3 is a direct result of the reduced wave elevation input to the numerical model we have already verified the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed transformed linear simulation method for generating equivalent waves as those obtained from the nonlinear simulation method we next show our simulation results of the power outputs of the aforementioned oswec when inputting nonlinearly simulated waves versus when inputting transformed linearly simulated waves table 4 shows our simulated 1200s power outputs of the wec at the sea state with a jonswap spectrum h s 2 00 m t p 11 64s γ 1 h 10 9 m these calculation results have been obtained by numerically integrating the wec motion equations eq 18 in wec sim we have carried out 10 simulations with nonlinearly simulated waves as inputs and another 10 simulations with transformed linearly simulated waves as inputs by carefully studying the calculation results in this table we can find that for each simulation serial the total power output value when inputting transformed linearly simulated waves is almost identical to the total power output value when inputting nonlinearly simulated waves the relative error is always less than or equal to 1 97 these calculation results fully and clearly substantiate the accuracy of our proposed transformed linear simulation method for predicting the power outputs of a wec operating in a realistic nonlinear sea with bottom effects 6 concluding remarks in this paper we have realistically predicted the power outputs of an oswec operating in shallow water nonlinear waves the bottom effects on the power performances of the wec have been taken into account during the calculations through the calculation results of the oswec power outputs under thirteen sea states with a jonswap wave spectrum with various parameters it is demonstrated that using linearly simulated waves without bottom effects as inputs in the simulation will significantly over predict the power outputs of the wave energy converter therefore nonlinearly simulated realistic waves with bottom effects have subsequently been utilized as the inputs in the oswec simulation processes in order to further improve the simulation efficiency a novel transformed linear simulation method is first proposed in this paper for generating equivalent waves as those obtained from the nonlinear simulation method the accuracy and efficiency of the novel transformed linear simulation method have been convincingly substantiated through the subsequent calculation

22830,this paper concerns the prediction of the power outputs of wave energy converters wecs operating in shallow water nonlinear waves the bottom effects on the power performances of wecs a phenomenon that has always been overlooked by the previous researchers have been taken into account during the calculations using an oscillating surge wave energy converter oswec as an example it is demonstrated in this article that for each sea state using linearly simulated waves without bottom effects as inputs in the simulation will always predict the oswec s power output more than 200 higher than the result predicted by inputting nonlinearly simulated waves with bottom effects therefore nonlinear simulated waves with bottom effects should instead be utilized as inputs in the simulation process in order to further improve the simulation efficiency a novel transformed linear simulation method is first proposed in this paper for generating equivalent waves as those obtained from the nonlinear simulation method further calculation examples show that the relative error of the predicted power output value when inputting transformed linearly simulated waves is always less than or equal to 1 97 keywords power output wave energy converters bottom effects nonlinear simulation transformed linear simulation abbreviations wec wave energy converter oswec oscillating surge wave energy

a kind of reliable and renewable energy and the worldwide wave energy resource potential is enormous the global wave power potential has been estimated to be around 8000 80000 twh y 1 10 tw which is in the same order of magnitude of the world electrical energy consumption fresco and traverso 2014 the interest in exploiting wave energy from the world oceans has been growing rapidly in recent years and various kinds of wecs have been or are being developed in europe u s a and other parts of the world see e g fresco and traverso 2014 yu et al 2014a b fan et al 2016 for the successful design and analysis of a wec realistically describing the ocean wave environment in which the wec will operate is of the utmost importance unfortunately in the present literature a wec s power outputs prediction is almost always performed by assuming that the wec is operating in linear irregular waves see e g the publications anderlini et al 2018 cargo et al 2014 dai et al 2017 eriksson et al 2005 fan et al 2016 fernandes and fonseca 2013 gomes et al 2015 herber and allison 2013 sánchez et al 2015 stelzer and joshi 2012 wang and isberg 2015 yu et al 2014a b zhang et al 2017 however the linear irregular wave model can only produce ideal waves with crest trough symmetries and this model is only suitable to approximately describe irregular waves in very deep sea and from a very moderate sea state in reality however when deep water waves become too steep or as the water depth decrease the waves will become statistically asymmetric i e the wave crests will become higher and sharper and the wave troughs will become shallower and flatter wang 2014 2018 this is called the crest trough asymmetry in the ocean engineering literature and the resulting waves are usually called nonlinear random waves alamian et al 2017 and folley et al 2007 had demonstrated in their studies that the shallow water depth effects on the performances of wecs can not be ignored in the performance analysis of a wec stelzer and joshi 2012 stated that an implicit assumption being made is that the energy converters are not placed in shallow waters since nonlinear wave theory may become more appropriate under such conditions from this statement it can be obviously found that the nonlinear wave theory should be applied in the performance analysis of wecs placed in shallow waters as stated in fernandes and fonseca 2013 most of the proposed wecs will be installed in shallow sea areas with water depths less than 90 m obviously the nonlinear random model should be used to simulate the shallow water waves as the inputs in the design analysis and optimization of most of the today s wecs however to the best knowledge of the author of this article in the current literature there are only two papers wang and wang 2018 wang 2018 in which the nonlinear random model has been used to simulate the shallow water waves as the inputs in the performance analysis of wecs a distinct disadvantage of the nonlinear random wave simulation model in the aforementioned two papers is that it is very time consuming furthermore the bottom effects on the power performances of wecs had not been taken into account in the aforementioned two papers it is well known that in a shallow water area the wave energy will be dissipated due to the existence of a bottom boundary layer therefore the calculation results in the aforementioned two papers obtained using nonlinearly simulated waves without bottom effects as simulation inputs can never be deemed reliable motivated by the above mentioned facts in this paper the power outputs of an oswec oscillating surge wave energy converter in a realistic second order nonlinear random sea will be rigorously predicted by a second order nonlinear simulation method the bottom effects on the power performances of the wec will be taken into account during the calculations in order to further improve the simulation efficiency a novel transformed linear simulation method will be first proposed in this paper for generating equivalent waves as those obtained from the second order nonlinear simulation method the accuracy and efficiency of the novel transformed linear simulation method will be substantiated through the subsequent calculation examples in this article the remainder of the paper will be organized in six sections in section 2 the theoretical background of the second order nonlinear random sea waves is given in section 3 we present the theories and derivations of the proposed transformed linear simulation method in section 4 the equations for the time domain simulation of a wec are elucidated in section 5 the calculation examples prediction results and discussions are presented with concluding remarks summarized in section 6 2 the second order nonlinear random sea waves waves in an idealized linear gaussian random sea have crest trough symmetry however it is known that waves in the real sea are nonlinear and the ocean surface elevation process deviates from the gaussian assumption i e the wave crests are becoming steeper and higher and the wave troughs are becoming flatter and shallower than expected under the gaussian assumption in the following we briefly introduce the theories of the second order nonlinear random sea waves the free surface elevation for an irregular sea state with a constant water depth d is denoted by η x t in which x is the longitudinal coordinate and t is time assuming this irregular sea state is characterized by a specific wave spectrum s η ω in which ω denotes the angular frequency then the first order linear solution for η x t can be expressed as follows see e g toffoli et al 2006 1 η 1 x t re n 0 n c n exp i ω n t k n x ε n as n tends to infinity in equation 1 re denotes the real part of the complex number and for each elementary cosine wave c n denotes its complex valued amplitude which is directly related to the specific wave spectrum s η ω by the relation e c n 2 s η ω n δ ω in equation 1 i denotes the imaginary unit ω n is the radian frequency and ω n n δ ω n ω c n and ω c is the upper cut off frequency beyond which the wave spectrum s η ω may be assumed to be zero for either mathematical or physical reasons k n is the wave number and ε n is the phase angle uniformly distributed in the interval 0 2 π furthermore the individual frequencies ω n and wave numbers k n in equation 1 are functionally related through the following dispersion relation 2 ω n 2 g k n tanh k n d where g is the gravitational acceleration and d is the water depth the traditional linear simulation method in the ocean engineering practice is to numerically implement equations 1 and 2 to generate the first order linear gaussian wave time histories at a specific location of the sea however waves in the real sea are nonlinear and non gaussian therefore the linear gaussian sea model as expressed in equations 1 and 2 should be corrected by including second order quadratic terms following langley 1987 and hasselmann 1962 the second order quadratic corrections are given by 3 η 2 x t re m 0 n n 0 n c m c n r m exp i ω m t k m x ε m ω n t k n x ε n q m exp i ω m t k m x ε m ω n t k n x ε n in the above equation r m and q m are called second order quadratic transfer functions the quadratic transfer functions r m and q m are given by 4 r m n 1 g 1 4 ω m ω n 2 ω m ω n ω n 2 ω m 2 k n k m g 2 ω n ω m 4 g 2 k m 2 ω m ω n 4 g 2 k n 2 ω m ω n 2 cosh k m k n d g k m k n sinh k m k n d ω m ω n cosh k m k n d 1 4 g ω m ω n k m k n g 2 ω n 2 ω m 2 1 4 g ω m 2 ω n 2 5 q m n 1 g 1 4 ω m ω n 2 ω m ω n ω n 2 ω m 2 k n k m g 2 ω n ω m 4 g 2 k m 2 ω m ω n 4 g 2 k n 2 ω n ω m 2 cosh k m k n d g k n k m sinh k n k m d ω n ω m cosh k n k m d 1 4 g ω m ω n k m k n g 2 ω n 2 ω m 2 1 4 g ω m 2 ω n 2 in the above two equations the wave numbers k n and frequencies ω n satisfy the same relation as in the linear case finally by combining equations 1 and 3 the wave surface elevations for the nonlinear random ocean waves can be written as 6 η x t η 1 x t η 2 x t re n 0 n c n exp i ω n t k n x ε n re m 0 n n 0 n c m c n r m n exp i ω m t k m x ε m ω n t k n x ε n q m n exp i ω m t k m x ε m ω n t k n x ε n the traditional nonlinear simulation method in the ocean engineering practice is to numerically implement equations 6 and 2 to generate the nonlinear wave time histories at a specific location of the sea for the numerical implementation of the nonlinear simulation the problem is usually divided into two processes i e first generating the first order linear gaussian time histories with a specific wave spectrum at a specific location for each of these the numerical algorithm then evaluating the full set of second order corrections according to the hydrodynamic theory as specified in this section therefore the first order wave process with n components at frequencies ω n gives rise to a total of n 2 corrections spreading over all sum frequencies at frequencies ω n ω m and to another n 2 corrections over all difference frequencies ω n ω m however the nonlinear simulation method as explained above will become very time consuming when n becomes large in order to overcome this drawback a novel transformed linear simulation method will first be proposed in this paper for generating equivalent waves as those obtained from the nonlinear simulation method and in the next section the theoretical background of this method will be elucidated 3 the proposed transformed linear simulation method our proposed transformed linear simulation method is an alternative and faster method than including the second order correction terms to the linear model it will use a deterministic and time instantaneous functional transformation the non gaussian wave elevation process η x t is then a function of a single gaussian process η x t 7 η x t g η x t where g is a continuously differentiable function with positive derivative in the proposed transformed linear simulation method the transformation model the g function is chosen to be a monotonic exponential function calibrated such that the first three moments of the transformed model match the moments of the true process without loss of generality we set the position coordinate x in η x t to be x 0 meanwhile we also write η 0 t in a simplified way as to be η t then after a lengthy derivation process as shown in langley 1987 eq 6 in section 2 can be re written in the following matrix notation 8 η t s t x x t q r x y t q r y where q and r are real symmetric matrix whose nmth components are s n s m q m and s n s m r m respectively s is a vector whose nth components are s n s n s η ω n d ω x and y are vectors whose nth components are x n and y n respectively and x n and y n are gaussian random variables whose expressions are shown in langley 1987 by performing an eigenvalue decomposition the above equation becomes 9 η t s t x x t p 1 t λ 1 p x y t p 2 t λ 2 p 2 y where λ 1 is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of the matrix q r in the respective diagonal and p 1 contains the corresponding eigenvectors per row meanwhile λ 2 is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of the matrix q r in the respective diagonal and p 2 contains the corresponding eigenvectors per row introducing a new set of gaussian random variables z j such that 10 z p 1 0 0 p 2 x y we can then write the stochastic process η t as this is called the kac siegert solution 11 η t j 1 2 n β j z j λ j z j 2 where z j are independent gaussian processes with unit variance and β j and λ j are coefficients computed based on the information provided by the wave spectrum s η ω which is chosen for a given sea state specifically the coefficients in the above equation are computed as follows 12 β p 1 s 0 13 λ λ 1 d λ 2 d where λ i d denotes a column vector formed by the diagonal elements of λ i from the above equation we can notice that the β j coefficients are computed based on the information of s directly related to the sea spectrum and the information of p 1 furthermore p 1 is computed based on the information of q and r and q and r are computed based on the information of the sea spectrum and the wave frequency range of the specific sea spectrum therefore the β j coefficients can be computed based entirely on the information provided by the sea spectrum similarly the λ j coefficients can also be computed based entirely on the information provided by the sea spectrum for a specific nonlinear sea state η t will be a non gaussian random process here we will use the simplest model for a non gaussian sea where η t is expressed as a function of a stationary gaussian process η t with mean value μ and variance σ 2 i e we can re express equation 7 as 14 η t g η t η t ζ η t 2 d g d η 0 g 0 0 actually we shall use the function g which is the inverse of g to define the transformation instead of g and use the relation η t g η t between the real sea data η t and the stationary gaussian process η t in our research the transformation model is chosen to be a monotonic exponential function calibrated such that the first three moments of the transformed model g η t match the moments of the true process η t information about the moments of the process can be obtained by resorting to theoretical models therefore the functional relationship between η t and η t given in eq 14 is inversely presented such that the stationary gaussian process η t is expressed approximately as a function of η t as follows wang 2015 ochi 1998 15 η t 1 γ ζ 1 exp γ ζ η t where γ is a constant 1 28 for η t 0 and 3 0 otherwise in order to determine the unknown parameters ζ μ and σ 2 in the above equation we first write equation 14 as follows 16 η t ζ η t 1 2 ζ 2 1 4 ζ by equalizing the cumulant generating functions of equation 16 and equation 11 we obtain the following relationships 17 ζ σ 2 ζ μ 2 μ 0 σ 2 2 ζ 2 σ 4 j 1 2 n β j 2 2 j 1 2 n λ j 2 3 ζ σ 4 8 ζ 3 σ 6 3 j 1 2 n λ j β j 2 4 j 1 2 n λ j 3 because β j and λ j in the above three sets of equations can be computed by using equations 12 and 13 based on the wave spectrum s η η ω which is chosen for a given sea state the unknown parameters ζ μ and σ 2 can be readily obtained by solving the above three sets of equations then we can obtain the functional transformation g i e the inverse of g g 1 4 time domain simulation of a wec in the current literature the power outputs prediction of a wec is usually conducted by using the time domain simulation method i e by numerically integrating the wec motion equations to obtain the power outputs time histories the time domain vector form motion equations of a wec subjected to wave loads and other loads can be expressed as 18 m r b a x t 0 t k t τ x τ d τ p h s p w a v e t p e x t t p v i s c t in the above equation m r b is the rigid body inertia matrix a is the constant infinite frequency added mass matrix x t is a vector of linear and angular displacements p h s is a vector of the hydrostatic restoring forces and moments meanwhile in eq 18 k t is a matrix of retardation functions due to the wec s motion waves will be generated in the free surface these waves will persist at all subsequent times and affect the wec s motion this is known as the hydrodynamic memory effects and they are captured in eq 18 by the convolution integral term that is a function of x τ and the retardation functions k t on the right hand side of the equality 18 p w a v e t denote the wave excitation loads forces and moments p e x t t denote the external loads forces and moments and p v i s c t denote the viscous loads forces and moments due to the hydrodynamic viscous effects up to now the wave excitation loads p w a v e t acting on a wec are usually calculated by using linearly simulated waves without bottom effects as inputs i e by inputting free surface elevation values generated by using eq 1 as pointed out in the introduction part of this paper this is not a very accurate approach on the other hand the power output results in wang and wang 2018 predicted by using nonlinearly simulated waves without bottom effects as inputs are also not correct therefore in the present work we will calculate the wave excitation loads p w a v e t acting on a specific wec by using nonlinearly simulated waves with bottom effects as inputs in order to further improve the simulation efficiency a novel transformed linear simulation method will first be proposed in this paper for generating equivalent nonlinear waves as the inputs for calculating the wave excitation loads p w a v e t our calculation results regarding a specific oswec oscillating surge wave energy converter will be presented and discussed in the next section 5 calculation examples prediction results and discussions 5 1 the chosen oswec oscillating surge wave energy converter in this study we will demonstrate our prediction results regarding a bottom hinged oswec as shown in fig 1 modeled in wec sim wec sim is a mid fidelity matlab based open source code developed by kelley ruehl and other researchers from sandia national laboratories and national renewable energy laboratory lawson et al 2015 ruehl et al 2016a b ruehl et al 2014 ruehl et al 2016a b yu et al 2014a b wec sim has the ability to model devices that are comprised of rigid bodies joints power take off systems and mooring systems simulations are performed in the time domain by solving the governing wec equations of motion fig 2 is a schematic representation of the chosen oswec the oswec shown in fig 1 captures wave energy from the relative motion between the flap and the fixed base the base is rigidly connected to the sea bottom the flap is connected to the base through a rotational joint the vertical distance from the still water surface to the rotational joint is 8 9 m as shown in fig 2 and the vertical distance from the rotational joint to the sea bottom is 2 0 m the rotational joint contains a spring damper system that represents the pto power take off system the flap is designed to rotate against the fixed base to convert wave energy into electrical power from the relative rotational motion induced by incoming waves the full scale dimensions of the oswec and the mass properties are shown in table 1 all the dimensions and mass properties of the oswec in table 1 are given based on the experimental study of hoff 2009 at this point it should be reminded that the water depth is only 10 9 m 8 9 m 2 0 m at the site where this oswec is installed therefore the shallow water random waves at this site will obviously be nonlinear see e g the nonlinear wave theory in ochi 1998 5 2 the prediction results and discussions we have predicted the power outputs of the above mentioned oswec by time domain simulations the widely used jonswap wave frequency spectrum is adopted in the process of simulation of the irregular sea waves the mathematical expression of the infinite water depth jonswap frequency spectrum with a significant wave height h s and spectral peak frequency ω p is as follows chakrabarti 1987 19 s ω α h s 2 ω 5 ω p 4 exp 1 25 ω ω p 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 ω p 2 σ 2 where ω is the wave angular frequency rad s h s is the significant wave height of a specific sea state and γ is the spectral peakedness factor in the above equation ω p is the spectral peak angular frequency and ω p 2 π t p t p is the spectral peak period of a specific sea state meanwhile in the above equation 20 α 0 0624 0 230 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ 21 σ 0 07 f o r ω ω p 0 09 f o r ω ω p the above jonswap spectrum is an infinite water depth wave spectrum which does not taken into account the sea bottom effects it is well known that in a shallow water area the wave energy will be dissipated due to the existence of a bottom boundary layer in shallow water in order to consider the correction for the effects of bottom on the wave spectrum a corrected wave spectrum s c ω is obtained in this paper by multiplying the original standard jonswap spectrum s ω by a function φ ω d that ranges between 0 and 1 according to the similarity law of buows et al 1985 22 s c ω s ω φ ω d s ω k ω d 3 ω k ω d k ω 3 ω k ω in the above formula ω d is a dimensionless frequency defined by ω d g k and ω satisfy the same dispersion relation as shown in equation 2 in formula 22 s c ω represents the finite water depth spectrum and s ω represents the infinite water depth spectrum in fig 3 the blue curve shows an infinite water depth jonswap wave spectrum with h s 4 25 m t p 5s obtained by using equations 19 21 the green curve in fig 3 shows a finite water depth d 10 9 m jonswap wave spectrum with h s 4 25 m t p 5s obtained by using equations 19 22 because the area under the curve of a specific jonswap wave spectrum is proportional to the value of the wave energy it is obvious that the energy under the green curve spectrum in fig 3 has reduced and this reduction is caused by the energy dissipation due to the sea bottom effects similarly the red curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 also shows the significant wave energy dissipation due to the existence of a bottom boundary layer in a shallow sea with h s 6 5 m t p 14s please note that in fig 3 the black curve shows an infinite water depth jonswap wave spectrum with h s 6 5 m t p 14s obtained by using equations 19 21 we next verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed transformed linear simulation method for generating equivalent waves as those obtained from the nonlinear simulation method fig 4 shows the results of a specific calculation example for this verification purpose in fig 4 the red curve shows the simulated 140s wave time series based on the green curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 using the nonlinear simulation method i e by numerically implementing equations 6 and 2 in section 2 in fig 4 the blue curve shows the simulated 140s wave time series based on the green curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 using the proposed transformed linear simulation method i e by implementing the theories and equations in section 3 we can obviously find that the blue curve in fig 4 fit the red curve very well and this fact can fully and clearly substantiate the accuracy of our proposed transformed linear simulation method by the way we can see that in fig 4 the green curve a linearly simulated 140s wave time series based on the blue curve infinite depth jonswap spectrum in fig 3 deviates a lot from the red curve a nonlinearly simulated 140s wave time series based on the green curve finite depth jonswap spectrum in fig 3 as another verification example fig 5 shows the good fit between a red curve a nonlinearly simulated 200s wave time series and a blue curve a transformed linearly simulated 200s wave time series based on the red curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 table 2 shows the quantitative metrics regarding the simulated wave time series corresponding to the red curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 the maximum wave surface elevation under the sea state of nonlinearly simulated waves is 2 0514 m the minimum wave surface elevation under the sea state of nonlinearly simulated waves is 1 7907 m we have carried out further calculations based on the data in table 2 and found that the percentage change with respect to the maximum minimum elevation is within 10 8 by using the transformed linear simulation method in comparison to the nonlinear simulation method the aforementioned calculation results once again clearly substantiate the accuracy of our proposed transformed linear simulation method for generating equivalent waves as those obtained from the nonlinear simulation method by the way we can see that in fig 5 the green curve a linearly simulated 200s wave time series based on the black curve infinite depth jonswap spectrum in fig 3 deviates a lot from the red curve a nonlinearly simulated 200s wave time series based on the red curve finite depth jonswap spectrum in fig 3 usually for predicting the power output of a wec operating in a specific sea state a large number of wave time series should first be generated as the inputs to the subsequent wec dynamic simulation processes for example in his prediction of the power outputs of a specific wec lindgren 2015 stated that for each damp ing value 1000 wave sections were simulated each 20 min long in section 2 we have theoretically illustrated why generating nonlinear wave time histories using the traditional nonlinear simulation method is very time consuming in this section we will use a specific calculation example to demonstrate that the nonlinear simulation method is indeed inefficient we have developed a matlab computer code to numerically implement equations 6 and 2 in section 2 to generate the nonlinear wave time histories based on the red curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 using this code 1000 wave sections have been simulated each 20 min long it took 142 5s to finish generating these 1000 wave sections on a desktop computer dell vostro 230 intel core tm 2 duo cpu e7500 2 93 ghz ram 4 0 gb similarly we have also developed another computer program to carry out the proposed transformed linear simulation method i e to implement the theories and equations in section 3 this program has been utilized to generate 1000 wave sections each 20 min long based on the red curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 it took 117 5s to finish generating these 1000 wave sections on a desktop computer dell vostro 230 intel core tm 2 duo cpu e7500 2 93 ghz ram 4 0 gb comparing to the nonlinear simulation method the proposed transformed linear simulation method is about 1 2 times faster these calculation results clearly substantiate the high efficiency of our proposed transformed linear simulation method for generating equivalent waves as those obtained from the nonlinear simulation method we next show our predicted power outputs of the aforementioned oswec operating in an ideal linear random sea without bottom effects versus operating in a realistic nonlinear random sea with bottom effects table 3 shows our calculation results of the oswec power outputs under thirteen sea states with a jonswap wave spectrum with different parameters please note that except for the h s and t p values in the last row all the other h s and t p values listed in table 3 are measured h s and t p values at the 035 cdip coastal data information program station on november 1994 http cdip ucsd edu 2 3 nav historic sub data stn 035 stream p1 these calculation results have been obtained by numerically integrating the wec motion equations eq 24 in wec sim however wec sim does not has the ability of generating nonlinear random waves which are the necessary inputs for calculating the hydrodynamic wave excitation load term p w a v e t in eq 18 therefore in our research we have separately generated the nonlinear waves with bottom effects in matlab according to the theories in equations 6 and 2 in section 2 and in equation 22 in this section for example for the sea state of h s 6 5 m t p 14s and γ 1 we have generated the nonlinear waves based on the red curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 the generated nonlinear random waves time series are saved as mat files and imported into wec sim for subsequent calculations wec sim has a feature whereby the wave elevation time series no matter it is generated by the linear simulation method or the nonlinear simulation method can be read from a file mat file into wec sim and wec sim will perform a fft fast fourier transform to calculate the amplitude and phase of each wave component from which wec sim will use to compute the full wave kinematics retaining the known amplitudes and phases the wec sim hydro coefficients for excitation radiation and added mass can subsequently be calculated for comparison purpose we have also separately generated the linear random waves without bottom effects in matlab for example for the sea state of h s 6 5 m t p 14s and γ 1 we have generated the linear random waves based on the black curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 the generated linear random waves time series are also saved as mat files and imported into wec sim for subsequent calculations in fig 6 the red curve shows a simulated 1200s wave time series corresponding to the red curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 h s 6 5 m t p 14s h 10 9 m using the nonlinear simulation method in fig 6 the blue curve shows a simulated 1200s wave time series corresponding to the black curve jonswap spectrum in fig 3 h s 6 5 m t p 14s h infinite depth using the linear simulation method the simulated power output p p t o is calculated by using the following equation in wec sim 23 p p t o c p t o x r e l 2 in the above equation c p t o is the damping of the pto power take off system of the wec in this example c p t o 50000000 nsm rad i e c p t o is a constant x r e l is the relative velocity between the two bodies of the wec as can be seen from the following figures fig 7 fig 8 x r e l when inputting nonlinearly simulated waves with a finite water depth is very different from the x r e l when inputting linearly simulated waves with an infinite water depth in fig 7 the red curve shows the obtained relative velocity time series between the two bodies of the wec when inputting the red curve nonlinear wave elevation time series in fig 6 into wec sim for subsequent simulation in fig 7 the black curve shows the obtained relative velocity time series between the two bodies of the wec when inputting the blue curve linear wave elevation time series in fig 6 into wec sim for subsequent simulation please note that the two curves in fig 7 all start from t 0s the wave ramp in fig 7 ends at t 50s fig 8 is a zoom in plot of fig 7 in the time interval of 40s 220s because the simulated power output p p t o is directly proportional to the second power of the relative velocity x r e l the obtained power output when inputting the red curve nonlinear wave elevation time series in fig 6 into wec sim for subsequent simulation will be much smaller than the power output when inputting the blue curve linear wave elevation time series in fig 6 into wec sim for subsequent simulation after obtaining the power outputs time series we have subsequently calculated the total power under each sea state and our calculation results are summarized in table 3 by carefully studying the calculation results in this table we can find that for each sea state using linearly simulated waves without bottom effects as inputs in the simulation will always predict the oswec power output more than 200 higher than the result predicted by inputting nonlinearly simulated waves with bottom effects for the smallest wave h s 2 00 m sea state using linearly simulated waves without bottom effects as inputs in the simulation will predict the oswec power output 346 higher than the result predicted by inputting nonlinearly simulated waves with bottom effects for the h s 6 44 m sea state using linearly simulated waves without bottom effects as inputs in the simulation will predict the oswec power output 254 higher than the result predicted by inputting nonlinearly simulated waves with bottom effects therefore nonlinearly simulated realistic waves with bottom effects should instead be utilized as inputs in the wec simulation processes finally it is pointed out once again that the power output change demonstrated in table 3 is a direct result of the reduced wave elevation input to the numerical model we have already verified the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed transformed linear simulation method for generating equivalent waves as those obtained from the nonlinear simulation method we next show our simulation results of the power outputs of the aforementioned oswec when inputting nonlinearly simulated waves versus when inputting transformed linearly simulated waves table 4 shows our simulated 1200s power outputs of the wec at the sea state with a jonswap spectrum h s 2 00 m t p 11 64s γ 1 h 10 9 m these calculation results have been obtained by numerically integrating the wec motion equations eq 18 in wec sim we have carried out 10 simulations with nonlinearly simulated waves as inputs and another 10 simulations with transformed linearly simulated waves as inputs by carefully studying the calculation results in this table we can find that for each simulation serial the total power output value when inputting transformed linearly simulated waves is almost identical to the total power output value when inputting nonlinearly simulated waves the relative error is always less than or equal to 1 97 these calculation results fully and clearly substantiate the accuracy of our proposed transformed linear simulation method for predicting the power outputs of a wec operating in a realistic nonlinear sea with bottom effects 6 concluding remarks in this paper we have realistically predicted the power outputs of an oswec operating in shallow water nonlinear waves the bottom effects on the power performances of the wec have been taken into account during the calculations through the calculation results of the oswec power outputs under thirteen sea states with a jonswap wave spectrum with various parameters it is demonstrated that using linearly simulated waves without bottom effects as inputs in the simulation will significantly over predict the power outputs of the wave energy converter therefore nonlinearly simulated realistic waves with bottom effects have subsequently been utilized as the inputs in the

salp swarm algorithm 1 introduction nowadays the classification of sonar targets based on their acoustic radiated signal is considered the wide range of targets and methods mosavi et al 2015a fialkowski and gauss 2010 levorato 2011 however the classification of various sonar targets marine vessels is a problematic issue for researchers taking into account both military and commercial aspects liu et al 2008 cipli et al 2015 two components such as dependence on the mode of operation and engine regimes intricate this procedure das et al 2013 the special recording environment the various propagation characteristics and environmental conditions mosavi et al 2015b these characteristics as well as time varying propagation channels ambient noises asolkar et al 2017 and time dispersions ristic et al 2017 cause to change in the spectrum of the received acoustic signals considering the aforementioned complexities two main classification models have been proposed in recent years firstly deterministic methods which are based on oceanography carral et al 2018 martinelli et al 2016 sonar modeling and engineering khishe et al 2014 abraham 2008 and also statistical processing hurtós et al 2017 miles et al 2006 secondly stochastic methods including the artificial intelligence ai approaches have various applications such as the prediction and approximation of

the shape parameter of the k distribution abraham 2008 these deterministic methods have three major disadvantages firstly these methods need the costly investment in equipment human resources and logistics abraham 2008 in addition these methods cannot guarantee the generality and robustness for other experimental areas fialkowski and gauss 2010 levorato 2011 the second group of investigations

najafzadeh et al 2016b and inherently parallel structure mosavi et al 2018a can result in being applicable in the ocean engineering problems particularly in the sonar target classification problem mlp networks are the most operational kinds of ai models for classifier designing mirjalili et al 2014 seiffert 2001 the most challenging part of mlp networks is learning algorithms mosavi et al 2016b gradient based and recursive methods have been traditionally utilized as learning algorithms zhang 2009 ng et al 2003 gradient based recursive methods have some deficiencies such as getting stuck in local minima and searching in a small local area mirjalili et al 2014 seiffert 2001 mendes et al 2002 therefore the results of traditional mlp networks are not reliable so this kind of classifier is not applicable to real world experimental problems mendes et al 2002 in the case of mlp network applications previous investigations indicated that meta heuristic algorithms are more profitable than gradient based methods for training phases mosavi et al 2015c 2016b 2018a blum and socha 2005 because the stochastic nature of meta heuristic algorithms helps them to avoid getting stuck in local minima so that there are many meta heuristic algorithms have been used to train mlp networks such as genetic algorithm ga patricia melin et al 2012 biogeography based optimization bbo mosavi et al 2016c 2017a khishe et al 2018a stochastic fractal search sfs khishe et al 2018b mosavi et al 2017b particle swarm optimization pso mirjalili et al 2013 and its modified version mosavi et al 2017c

optimization algorithm woa aljarah et al 2018 no free lunch nfl theorem proves that any one meta heuristic algorithm that searches for an optimal fitness solution is not universally superior to any other meta heuristic algorithm therefore some algorithms are the best suited for a particular optimization problem rather than other meta heuristic algorithms ho and pepyne 2002 on the other hand it has been proven that the convergence rate of the ssa algorithm is faster than many other meta heuristic algorithms in various benchmark optimization functions mirjalili et al 2017 this also motivates attempts of the authors to develop a new classifier with inspiration from the behaviour of salp swarming the paper is organized as follow section 2 introduces the general structure of mlp section 3 discusses the principles of ssa the proposed ssa based training approach is described in section 4 in section 5 the experimental results are presented and the paper is concluded in section 6 finally 2 multi layer perceptron neural network the mlp network is the most common and applicable type of feedforward neural networks neurons are the main processing elements of mlp networks in mlp networks neurons are interconnected in a one directional fashion by connections called weights aljarah et al 2018 a three layer mlp network is shown in fig 1 where n represents the number of input nodes h represents the number of hidden nodes and m denotes the number of output nodes mosavi et al 2015c the output of the mlp network is calculated by eq 1 1 s j i 1 n w i j x i θ j j 1 2 h where w ij is the weight connecting the i th node in the input layer to j th node in the hidden layer θ j denotes j th bias node in the hidden layer and x i represents the input to the i th node in the input layer the output of each hidden node is calculated using a sigmoid function as in eq 2 after calculating the values of the hidden nodes the finals output can be defined as follows 4 o k s i g m o i d o k 1 1 e x p o k k 1 2 m where w jk is the weight connecting the j th node in the hidden layer to the k th node output layer and θ k represents the k th bias node in the output layer 3 salp swarm algorithm salp is a member of salpidae family and have a transparent body similar to jellyfishes in which the water is pumped through its body as propulsion to move forward mirjalili et al 2017 3 1 the mathematical model of ssa salp chain is mathematically modeled in reference mirjalili et al 2017 in this model salp population is divided into two main categories leader and follower the leader is the first salp in the chain and other salps are considered as followers in this algorithm salps are located in an n dimensional search space where n is the number of problem variables as a result the positions of salps are stored in a two dimensional matrix named x and also matrix f is considered as a source food matrix or target in the optimization problems eq 5 is utilized to update the position of the leader mirjalili et al 2017 5 x j 1 f j c 1 u b j l b j c 2 l b j c 3 0 f j c 1 u b j l b j c 2 l b j c 3 0 where x j 1 indicates the position of leader in the jth dimension f j shows the food source target in the jth dimension ub j and lb j indicate the upper bound and the lower bound of the jth dimension respectively c1 c2 and c3 are also random numbers as shown in eq 5 the position of leader is updated considering f matrix and c 1 is the most important coefficient in ssa balancing exploration and exploitation phase this coefficient is defined as eq 6 6 c 1 2 e 4 l l 2 where l indicates the current iteration and l shows the maximum number of iterations eq 7 is used to update the position of followers mirjalili et al 2017 7 x j i 1 2 a t 2 v 0 t where i is bigger than 2 x i j indicates the location of ith follower in jth dimension t is time v0 indicate the initial speed in optimization problems iteration is considered as time so eq 7 can be expressed as eq 8 8 x j i 1 2 x j i x j i 1 as previously stated ub j and lb j indicates the upper bound and lower bound of the jth dimension respectively if any of the search agents go outside the searching space it will be brought back on the boundaries also f is defined as the source of food if the source of food considers as a final target or a final optimum this problem will be considered as an optimization problem however the final optimum of optimization problems is not known in this case the best solution acquired so far is considered as the final optimum and f matrix 4 training mlp networks using ssa generally there are three methods to train an mlp network the first method is to use meta heuristic algorithms in order to find the best connection weights and node biases for having a minimum error in the test phase the second method is to use meta heuristic algorithms in order to find the proper structure of the mlp network on a specific problem the last method is to use meta heuristic algorithms to find training algorithm parameters based on gradient such as learning rate and momentum khishe et al 2016 in this section the ssa gets exerted to the mlp by using first method in this section the proposed method for training the mlp network based on the ssa will be described ssa is applied to train a single layer mlp network to design the classifier two important issues should be taken into consideration first the presentation of the search agents salps additionally the second one is the selection of the fitness function generally speaking there are three general methods to represent encode the combination of weights and biases of an mlp network as salps 1 vector 2 matrix and 3 binary state mosavi et al 2015b in vector based each salp encodes as a vector all weights biases should be clear to train the designed classifier in matrix based each salp is encoded as a matrix and in binary based each salp is encoded in the form of a string of binary bits in this paper a vector based method is utilized to represent a candidate mlp network since we are not dealing with mlp networks with complex structure aforementioned vectors represents the learning parameters of the mlp network which are the connection weights between the input layer and the hidden layer the weights between the hidden layer and the output layer and the biases aljarah et al 2018 the final length of each vector is equal to the total number of weights and biases in the mlp network and it can be calculated using eq 9 9 salp chain s length n h h m h where n is the number of input nodes h is the number of the hidden layer neurons and m is the number of output nodes as an example of this encoding methodology the final vector of search agent salp chain in fig 2 is presented as eq 10 also as stated previously the second important part of the training methodology is to define a fitness function for evaluating each of the modeled vectors salps in this paper the mean square error mse is utilized to measure the fitness value of the generated salps as the fitness function of ssa mse is based on calculating the difference between the desired values by the searching agents salps and actual values for all the training samples mse is calculated by eq 11 11 e k 1 t i 1 m o i k d i k 2 t where t is the number of training samples m is the number of outputs d i k is the desired output related to the ith input when the kth training sample is utilized and also o i k is the actual output of the ith input when the kth training sample is used the flowchart of the proposed classifier is shown in fig 3 5 experimental result and discussion in this section first the capability of ssa for finding the global minima and convergence rate is evaluated after proving the capability of ssa to working with high dimensional evaluation function this algorithm will be benchmarked by using experimental sonar target classification problem 5 1 benchmark function as shown in table 1 four standard benchmark functions with various dimensions are tested by ssa for finding the global minimum mosavi et al 2016b in this table dim is the dimensions of the functions range indicates the range of search space and f min is the minimum of the benchmark function in order to verify the results the results of ssa are compared to gwo isa and bbo table 2 shows the coefficients and parameters of the benchmark algorithms the results for benchmark functions are shown in fig 4 these benchmark functions have many local optima these local optima will grow exponentially when the number of dimension increases therefore these kinds of benchmark functions are appropriate for testing the ability of algorithms to avoid getting stuck in local optima as the results show ssa has better results compared to other benchmark algorithms fig 4 shows that the convergence curves of ssa are faster than other benchmark algorithms to avoid getting stuck in local minima this improvement of performance is the outcome of salp chain as mentioned in section 3 the salp chain system causes more random search behavior compares to other benchmark algorithms in this case the salps cannot easily fall into the trap of local minima 5 2 sonar targets classification in this section an experimental real world engineering problem is utilized to prove the capability of mlp ssa to working with challenging real world high dimensional problems 5 2 1 experimental setup closed water circuit cavitation tunnel model na 10 england schematically represented in fig 5 is utilized to produce a reliable sonar dataset furthermore tunnel dimensions and particulars are reported in table 3 to carry out the test three model propellers with slightly different dimensions are considered the main characteristics and detailed design parameters for each propeller are reported in table 4 in this experiment the propeller revolution rate is 1800 rpm and the flow speed is 4 m s radiated sound measurements have been carried out with two hydrophones model b k 8103 the hydrophones are coupled with the data accusation board model udaq lite specifications of the data accusation board are listed in table 5 the test scenario and hydrophones configuration are shown in fig 6 where ae ao is the blade area ratio p d indicates the pitch diameter ratio t 0 is thrust in open water and j is the advanced coefficient 5 2 2 noises and reflections removal stages assume that x t and y t are the reverberant noisy signals of hydrophone 1 and hydrophone 2 respectively also s t is the undistorted source of propeller two reverberant signals are mathematically model as follow 12 x t t h t τ s τ 13 y t t g t τ s τ where g t and h t are the square testing section response functions these response functions are assumed to be unknown nevertheless the tails of g and h are uncorrelated allen et al 1997 it is obvious that the first few echoes do not arrive at the two hydrophones simultaneously considering the underwater acoustics standard ittc 2017 sound pressure level spl is usually stated in term of db re 1 μpa but the output of the hydrophone b k 8103 is in μ v pa therefore the hydrophones output should be multiplied by 10 6 after exerting hamming windows and subsequent fast fourier transforms ffts the frequency domain spl will be achieved in the literature it is common to reduce the measured values of spl in each 1 3 octave band to an equal 1 hz bandwidth by means of eq 14 ittc 2017 14 spl1 splm 10 logδf where splm is the measured spl at each center frequency in db re 1 μpa and δf is the bandwidth for each 1 3 octave band filter and spl1 is the reduced spl to 1 hz bandwidth in db re 1 μpa in order to distinguish the propeller noise the correction for the background noise measurements is applied to the measured total noise levels for this purpose the background noise is recorded with dummy hub which is used instead of designed propellers bertschneider et al 2014 this correction is utilized based on the level of the difference following the procedure in reference ittc 2017 in this methodology the result has to be discarded when the difference is smaller than 3 db in another side the results are modified according to eq 15 when the difference is between 3 and 10 db furthermore no correction is applied when the difference is greater than 10 db to sum up the signal is omitted for regions where the data has a low signal to noise ratio i e less than 3 db 15 spl p 10 log 10 s p l t 10 10 s p l b 10 where t p and b indicate the total propeller and background noise respectively in the next step spls must be modified to a standard measuring distance of 1 m as follow 16 spl spl1 20 log r where spl1 is the 1 hz bandwidth spl in db re 1 μpa spl is the equal 1 hz at 1 m distance spl in db re 1 μpa and r is the distance between the hydrophone and the center of the noise source center of the propeller disk bertschneider et al 2014 the entire preprocessing stage background noise removal is shown in fig 7 after removing the background noise it is time to remove the wall reflections as previously stated the preprocessing steps are accomplished in frequency bands first in each frequency band existing delays between the coherent parts or early echoes are removed by a phase shift this part of the preprocessing step is named co phase and add in bands bertschneider et al 2014 afterwards for each frequency band it regulates the gain by a normalized cross correlation function the gain adjusting process causes to eliminate uncorrelated signals and to pass correlated signals the resulting signals in each frequency band are then combined to generate the signal estimate i e s ˆ the wall reflections removal stage is shown in fig 8 it must be noted that the application of the gain controller depends on different inputs when x and y are the same i e s ˆ x y or one of them is delayed by a few milliseconds the delay is adjusted automatically as s ˆ t x t t y t where t is a hypothetical delay modification if the delay is greater than the window length l the x and y are being uncorrelated and the gain is being zero finally when x and y are uncorrelated totally s ˆ t is zero all of the terms are true for each frequency band thus if x and y are uncorrelated at one frequency and correlated at another then the uncorrelated part is removed and the correlated part remains since all of the operations are defined on a moving average basis everything may change as a function of time the various elements of the previous process have been discussed by ittc 2017 only three typical presentations of the recorded propeller noise their fourier transform and power spectral density function are reported in fig 9 as an example the detail of frequency characteristics of physical phenomena are just explained in fig 9 c however for a better interpretation of noise results these explanations can be generalized for other propellers and their operational conditions as shown in fig 9 c an anomalous peak was indicated around low frequencies this noise component is due to the vibration of foils or other interior parts other tonal components are presented above 90 hz the characteristic frequencies of such components are multiple of the fundamental frequency and also shaft rate the fundamental frequency is calculated as follow 17 f f u n d a m e n t a l r p m n u m b e r o f b l a d e 60 hz for propeller c with three blades and revolution rate equals 1800 rpm the fundamental frequency is equal to 90 hz and other tonal components are the multiplication of the fundamental frequency however the effects of cavitation noise are indicated by the increased levels of the continuous part of the spectra as a result it is hard to identify different spectral components in the propeller noise generally all cavitation phenomena cause broadband noise and tonal noise so the cavitation of propeller is usually characterized by specific random components which contribute to the continuous part of the spectrum however spl slightly decreases as frequency increases to sum up the continuous part of the spectrum is indicative of the broadband noise generated by both suction side cavitation and tip vortex 5 2 3 feature extraction after preprocessing and detecting the frames containing the sound of propellers the effects of background noise and reflections were eliminated then these frames were transferred to the frequency domain s k and delivered to the feature extraction section at this step the spectrum of the signal is calculated as follow 18 s k 2 s r 2 k s i 2 k where s r 2 k and s i 2 k are the real and the imaginary parts of the fourier transform for the sounds of propellers then the spectral energy is filtered by a mel scaled triangular filter the output energy of the lth filter e l is calculated by eq 19 19 e l k 0 n 1 s k 2 h l k where n is the number of discrete frequencies used for fft in the preprocessing stage and h l k is the transfer function of the given filter where l 0 1 m the dynamic range of the mel filtered energy spectrum is compacted by the logarithmic function as eq 20 20 e l log e l finally mel frequency cepstral coefficients are converted back to the time domain using eq 21 and discrete cosine transform dct 21 c n l 1 m e l cos n l 0 5 π m finally the feature vector will be in the form of eq 22 22 x m c 0 c 1 c p 1 t in the next stage the x m vector is considered as an input vector of the mlp network consequently the number of input node is equal to p the block diagram of the feature extraction process is shown in fig 10 the first 512 cepstral coefficients out of 8192 coefficients present in one frame for a sampling rate of 8192 hz corresponding to 62 5 ms excluding the zeroth index c y m 0 which is simply the logarithm of the energy have been windowed from the n indices equivalent to one frame length and then grouped into uniform bands of 16 each to reduce the cepstral dimension to 32 features the sub frame length is 1 s and five such sub frames are averaged during the spectral averaging process to obtain a frame of 1 s compressed from 5 s duration prior to averaging the average cepstral features are obtained by smoothing ten previous frames corresponding to 50 s an average cepstral feature vector comprising of 32 features is obtained 5 2 4 the result of sonar dataset classification as previously stated the x m vector is considered as an input vector for the mlp network the dimension of x m is 450 32 it means that dataset has 450 samples and 32 features since the number of input node is equal to the number of features the number of input nodes is equal to 32 in order to preserve class distribution the dataset is divided into 70 for training and 30 for testing using stratified sampling to have a fair comparison all algorithms stop after reaching a maximum of 500 iterations regarding the structure of mlp networks since there is no standard rule for selecting the number of hidden nodes the suggestions in mirjalili et al 2014 is used as follow 23 h 2 n 1 where n is the number of inputs and h represents the number of hidden nodes also the number of output neurons is equal to the sonar classes i e 3 neurons to evaluate the performance of the designed classifier results of mlp ssa has been compared with the gwo bbo and isa trainers as well as gmdh najafzadeh and saberi movahed 2018a required parameters and initial values are presented in table 2 each classifier is evaluated 20 times and the average convergence curve of mse is shown in fig 11 also the statistical result is illustrated in table 6 it should be noted that the simulations are performed in matlab using a pc with a 2 3 ghz processor and 4 gb ram to have a comprehensive comparison the average ave and standard deviation std of mse are calculated in table 6 to reach a greater capability of the algorithm in order to avoid local minima the value of ave std must be lower note that the best results are highlighted in bold type in table 6 according to derrac et al 2011 statistical tests are essential to have a fair evaluation of the performance of meta heuristic trainers as well as ave std in order to see whether the obtained results of ssa differ from other benchmark trainers in a statistically significant way a non parametric statistical test wilcoxon s rank sum test wilcoxon 1945 was accomplished at 5 significance level therefore the obtained p values are shown in the table of results as well in table 6 n a indicates not applicable which means that the specified trainer cannot be compared with itself in the wilcoxon s rank sum test logically p values less than 0 05 are considered as powerful evidence against the null hypothesis therefore p values greater than 0 05 are underlined in the tables another comparative measure shown in the results is classification rate to sum up the ssa has the best convergence rates among other benchmark methods the reason for the improved capability in avoiding local minima is that the salp chain gives ssa more accelerated search in comparison with the popular benchmark trainers in the exploitation phase hence the searching agents are not easily trapped in local minima and reach global minima faster than normal searching agent strategies the results of the sonar target classification show that the mlp ssa outperforms other benchmark trainers the better ave proves that mlp ssa performs better than other classifiers on average and the stds demonstrate that this superiority is stable the results of the p values in table 6 produced from the wilcoxon s rank sum test indicate that the superiority is statistically significant 6 conclusion in this study passive sonar targets were classified by mfccs and mlp networks in this approaches cepstral feature was utilized to alleviate dataset s dimension and mlp network to adapt the variability in changing condition also to overcome the shortcomings of mlp networks the use of the newly introduced salp swarm algorithm was proposed for training mlp network in order to investigate the efficiencies of ssa in training mlp networks four high dimensional benchmark functions as well as an experimental sonar data set were employed the proposed classifier was compared to gwo bbo isa and gmdh benchmark algorithms the results showed that the designed classifier mlp ssa was more efficient than other benchmark algorithms in term of classification accuracy entrapment in local minima and convergence speed the ssa classified sonar data set as much as 0 9017 percent better than gmdh being the best results among the other classifiers in general application of the mlp ssa to investigate the passive sonar targets classification was proven that this algorithm can be used well for classification the changing and high dimensional underwater datasets

neurons are interconnected in a one directional fashion by connections called weights aljarah et al 2018 a three layer mlp network is shown in fig 1 where n represents the number of input nodes h represents the number of hidden nodes and m denotes the number of output nodes mosavi et al 2015c the output of the mlp network is calculated by eq 1 1 s j i 1 n w i j x i θ j j 1 2 h where w ij is the weight connecting the i th node in the input layer to j th node in the hidden layer θ j denotes j th bias node in the hidden layer and x i represents the input to the i th node in the input layer the output of each hidden node is calculated using a sigmoid function as in eq 2 after calculating the values of the hidden nodes the finals output can be defined as follows 4 o k s i g m o i d o k 1 1 e x p o k k 1 2 m where w jk is the weight connecting the j th node in the hidden layer to the k th node output layer and θ k represents the k th bias node in the output layer 3 salp swarm algorithm salp is a member of salpidae family and have a transparent body similar to jellyfishes in which the water is pumped through its body as propulsion to move forward mirjalili et al 2017 3 1 the mathematical model of ssa salp chain is mathematically modeled in reference mirjalili et al 2017 in this model salp population is divided into two main categories leader and follower the leader is the first salp in the chain and other salps are considered as followers in this algorithm salps are located in an n dimensional search space where n is the number of problem variables as a result the positions of salps are stored in a two dimensional matrix named x and also matrix f is considered as a source food matrix or target in the optimization problems eq 5 is utilized to update the position of the leader mirjalili et al 2017 5 x j 1 f j c 1 u b j l b j c 2 l b j c 3 0 f j c 1 u b j l b j c 2 l b j c 3 0 where x j 1 indicates the position of leader in the jth dimension f j shows the food source target in the jth dimension ub j and lb j indicate the upper bound and the lower bound of the jth dimension respectively c1 c2 and c3 are also random numbers as shown in eq 5 the position of leader is updated considering f matrix and c 1 is the most important coefficient in ssa balancing exploration and exploitation phase this coefficient is defined as eq 6 6 c 1 2 e 4 l l 2 where l indicates the current iteration and l shows the maximum number of iterations eq 7 is used to update the position of followers mirjalili et al 2017 7 x j i 1 2 a t 2 v 0 t where i is bigger than 2 x i j indicates the location of ith follower in jth dimension t is time v0 indicate the initial speed in optimization problems iteration is considered as time so eq 7 can be expressed as eq 8 8 x j i 1 2 x j i x j i 1 as previously stated ub j and lb j indicates the upper bound and lower bound of the jth dimension respectively if any of the search agents go outside the searching space it will be brought back on the boundaries also f is defined as the source of food if the source of food considers as a final target or a final optimum this problem will be considered as an optimization problem however the final optimum of optimization problems is not known in this case the best solution acquired so far is considered as the final optimum and f matrix 4 training mlp networks using ssa generally there are three methods to train an mlp network the first method is to use meta heuristic algorithms in order to find the best connection weights and node biases for having a minimum error in the test phase the second method is to use meta heuristic algorithms in order to find the proper structure of the mlp network on a specific problem the last method is to use meta heuristic algorithms to find training algorithm parameters based on gradient such as learning rate and momentum khishe et al 2016 in this section the ssa gets exerted to the mlp by using first method in this section the proposed method for training the mlp network based on the ssa will be described ssa is applied to train a single layer mlp network to design the classifier two important issues should be taken into consideration first the presentation of the search agents salps additionally the second one is the selection of the fitness function generally speaking there are three general methods to represent encode the combination of weights and biases of an mlp network as salps 1 vector 2 matrix and 3 binary state mosavi et al 2015b in vector based each salp encodes as a vector all weights biases should be clear to train the designed classifier in matrix based each salp is encoded as a matrix and in binary based each salp is encoded in the form of a string of binary bits in this paper a vector based method is utilized to represent a candidate mlp network since we are not dealing with mlp networks with complex structure aforementioned vectors represents the learning parameters of the mlp network which are the connection weights between the input layer and the hidden layer the weights between the hidden layer and the output layer and the biases aljarah et al 2018 the final length of each vector is equal to the total number of weights and biases in the mlp network and it can be calculated using eq 9 9 salp chain s length n h h m h where n is the number of input nodes h is the number of the hidden layer neurons and m is the number of output nodes as an example of this encoding methodology the final vector of search agent salp chain in fig 2 is presented as eq 10 also as stated previously the second important part of the training methodology is to define a fitness function for evaluating each of the modeled vectors salps in this paper the mean square error mse is utilized to measure the fitness value of the generated salps as the fitness function of ssa mse is based on calculating the difference between the desired values by the searching agents salps and actual values for all the training samples mse is calculated by eq 11 11 e k 1 t i 1 m o i k d i k 2 t where t is the number of training samples m is the number of outputs d i k is the desired output related to the ith input when the kth training sample is utilized and also o i k is the actual output of the ith input when the kth training sample is used the flowchart of the proposed classifier is shown in fig 3 5 experimental result and discussion in this section first the capability of ssa for finding the global minima and convergence rate is evaluated after proving the capability of ssa to working with high dimensional evaluation function this algorithm will be benchmarked by using experimental sonar target classification problem 5 1 benchmark function as shown in table 1 four standard benchmark functions with various dimensions are tested by ssa for finding the global minimum mosavi et al 2016b in this table dim is the dimensions of the functions range indicates the range of search space and f min is the minimum of the benchmark function in order to verify the results the results of ssa are compared to gwo isa and bbo table 2 shows the coefficients and parameters of the benchmark algorithms the results for benchmark functions are shown in fig 4 these benchmark functions have many local optima these local optima will grow exponentially when the number of dimension increases therefore these kinds of benchmark functions are appropriate for testing the ability of algorithms to avoid getting stuck in local optima as the results show ssa has better results compared to other benchmark algorithms fig 4 shows that the convergence curves of ssa are faster than other benchmark algorithms to avoid getting stuck in local minima this improvement of performance is the outcome of salp chain as mentioned in section 3 the salp chain system causes more random search behavior compares to other benchmark algorithms in this case the salps cannot easily fall into the trap of local minima 5 2 sonar targets classification in this section an experimental real world engineering problem is utilized to prove the capability of mlp ssa to working with challenging real world high dimensional problems 5 2 1 experimental setup closed water circuit cavitation tunnel model na 10 england schematically represented in fig 5 is utilized to produce a reliable sonar dataset furthermore tunnel dimensions and particulars are reported in table 3 to carry out the test three model propellers with slightly different dimensions are considered the main characteristics and detailed design parameters for each propeller are reported in table 4 in this experiment the propeller revolution rate is 1800 rpm and the flow speed is 4 m s radiated sound measurements have been carried out with two hydrophones model b k 8103 the hydrophones are coupled with the data accusation board model udaq lite specifications of the data accusation board are listed in table 5 the test scenario and hydrophones configuration are shown in fig 6 where ae ao is the blade area ratio p d indicates the pitch diameter ratio t 0 is thrust in open water and j is the advanced coefficient 5 2 2 noises and reflections removal stages assume that x t and y t are the reverberant noisy signals of hydrophone 1 and hydrophone 2 respectively also s t is the undistorted source of propeller two reverberant signals are mathematically model as follow 12 x t t h t τ s τ 13 y t t g t τ s τ where g t and h t are the square testing section response functions these response functions are assumed to be unknown nevertheless the tails of g and h are uncorrelated allen et al 1997 it is obvious that the first few echoes do not arrive at the two hydrophones simultaneously considering the underwater acoustics standard ittc 2017 sound pressure level spl is usually stated in term of db re 1 μpa but the output of the hydrophone b k 8103 is in μ v pa therefore the hydrophones output should be multiplied by 10 6 after exerting hamming windows and subsequent fast fourier transforms ffts the frequency domain spl will be achieved in the literature it is common to reduce the measured values of spl in each 1 3 octave band to an equal 1 hz bandwidth by means of eq 14 ittc 2017 14 spl1 splm 10 logδf where splm is the measured spl at each center frequency in db re 1 μpa and δf is the bandwidth for each 1 3 octave band filter and spl1 is the reduced spl to 1 hz bandwidth in db re 1 μpa in order to distinguish the propeller noise the correction for the background noise measurements is applied to the measured total noise levels for this purpose the background noise is recorded with dummy hub which is used instead of designed propellers bertschneider et al 2014 this correction is utilized based on the level of the difference following the procedure in reference ittc 2017 in this methodology the result has to be discarded when the difference is smaller than 3 db in another side the results are modified according to eq 15 when the difference is between 3 and 10 db furthermore no correction is applied when the difference is greater than 10 db to sum up the signal is omitted for regions where the data has a low signal to noise ratio i e less than 3 db 15 spl p 10 log 10 s p l t 10 10 s p l b 10 where t p and b indicate the total propeller and background noise respectively in the next step spls must be modified to a standard measuring distance of 1 m as follow 16 spl spl1 20 log r where spl1 is the 1 hz bandwidth spl in db re 1 μpa spl is the equal 1 hz at 1 m distance spl in db re 1 μpa and r is the distance between the hydrophone and the center of the noise source center of the propeller disk bertschneider et al 2014 the entire preprocessing stage background noise removal is shown in fig 7 after removing the background noise it is time to remove the wall reflections as previously stated the preprocessing steps are accomplished in frequency bands first in each frequency band existing delays between the coherent parts or early echoes are removed by a phase shift this part of the preprocessing step is named co phase and add in bands bertschneider et al 2014 afterwards for each frequency band it regulates the gain by a normalized cross correlation function the gain adjusting process causes to eliminate uncorrelated signals and to pass correlated signals the resulting signals in each frequency band are then combined to generate the signal estimate i e s ˆ the wall reflections removal stage is shown in fig 8 it must be noted that the application of the gain controller depends on different inputs when x and y are the same i e s ˆ x y or one of them is delayed by a few milliseconds the delay is adjusted automatically as s ˆ t x t t y t where t is a hypothetical delay modification if the delay is greater than the window length l the x and y are being uncorrelated and the gain is being zero finally when x and y are uncorrelated totally s ˆ t is zero all of the terms are true for each frequency band thus if x and y are uncorrelated at one frequency and correlated at another then the uncorrelated part is removed and the correlated part remains since all of the operations are defined on a moving average basis everything may change as a function of time the various elements of the previous process have been discussed by ittc 2017 only three typical presentations of the recorded propeller noise their fourier transform and power spectral density function are reported in fig 9 as an example the detail of frequency characteristics of physical phenomena are just explained in fig 9 c however for a better interpretation of noise results these explanations can be generalized for other propellers and their operational conditions as shown in fig 9 c an anomalous peak was indicated around low frequencies this noise component is due to the vibration of foils or other interior parts other tonal components are presented above 90 hz the characteristic frequencies of such components are multiple of the fundamental frequency and also shaft rate the fundamental frequency is calculated as follow 17 f f u n d a m e n t a l r p m n u m b e r o f b l a d e 60 hz for propeller c with three blades and revolution rate equals 1800 rpm the fundamental frequency is equal to 90 hz and other tonal components are the multiplication of the fundamental frequency however the effects of cavitation noise are indicated by the increased levels of the continuous part of the spectra as a result it is hard to identify different spectral components in the propeller noise generally all cavitation phenomena cause broadband noise and tonal noise so the cavitation of propeller is usually characterized by specific random components which contribute to the continuous part of the spectrum however spl slightly decreases as frequency increases to sum up the continuous part of the spectrum is indicative of the broadband noise generated by both suction side cavitation and tip vortex 5 2 3 feature extraction after preprocessing and detecting the frames containing the sound of propellers the effects of background noise and reflections were eliminated then these frames were transferred to the frequency domain s k and delivered to the feature extraction section at this step the spectrum of the signal is calculated as follow 18 s k 2 s r 2 k s i 2 k where s r 2 k and s i 2 k are the real and the imaginary parts of the fourier transform for the sounds of propellers then the spectral energy is filtered by a mel scaled triangular filter the output energy of the lth filter e l is calculated by eq 19 19 e l k 0 n 1 s k 2 h l k where n is the number of discrete frequencies used for fft in the preprocessing stage and h l k is the transfer function of the given filter where l 0 1 m the dynamic range of the mel filtered energy spectrum is compacted by the logarithmic function as eq 20 20 e l log e l finally mel frequency cepstral coefficients are converted back to the time domain using eq 21 and discrete cosine transform dct 21 c n l 1 m e l cos n l 0 5 π m finally the feature vector will be in the form of eq 22 22 x m c 0 c 1 c p 1 t in the next stage the x m vector is considered as an input vector of the mlp network consequently the number of input node is equal to p the block diagram of the feature extraction process is shown in fig 10 the first 512 cepstral coefficients out of 8192 coefficients present in one frame for a sampling rate of 8192 hz corresponding to 62 5 ms excluding the zeroth index c y m 0 which is simply the logarithm of the energy have been windowed from the n indices equivalent to one frame length and then grouped into uniform bands of 16 each to reduce the cepstral dimension to 32 features the sub frame length is 1 s and five such sub frames are averaged during the spectral averaging process to obtain a frame of 1 s compressed from 5 s duration prior to averaging the average cepstral features are obtained by smoothing ten previous frames corresponding to 50 s an average cepstral feature vector comprising of 32 features is obtained 5 2 4 the result of sonar dataset classification as previously stated the x m vector is considered as an input vector for the mlp network the dimension of x m is 450 32 it means that dataset has 450 samples and 32 features since the number of input node is equal to the number of features the number of input nodes is equal to 32 in order to preserve class distribution the dataset is divided into 70 for training and 30 for testing using stratified sampling to have a fair comparison all algorithms stop after reaching a maximum of 500 iterations regarding the structure of mlp networks since there is no standard rule for selecting the number of hidden nodes the suggestions in mirjalili et al 2014 is used as follow 23 h 2 n 1 where n is the number of inputs and h represents the number of hidden nodes also the number of output neurons is equal to the sonar classes i e 3 neurons to evaluate the performance of the designed classifier results of mlp ssa has been compared with the gwo bbo and isa trainers as well as gmdh najafzadeh and saberi movahed 2018a required parameters and initial values are presented in table 2 each classifier is evaluated 20 times and the average convergence curve of mse is shown in fig 11 also the statistical result is illustrated in table 6 it should be noted that the simulations are performed in matlab using a pc with a 2 3 ghz processor and 4 gb ram to have a comprehensive comparison the average ave and standard deviation std of mse are calculated in table 6 to reach a greater capability of the algorithm in order to avoid local minima the value of ave std must be lower note that the best results are highlighted in bold type in table 6 according to derrac et al 2011 statistical tests are essential to have a fair evaluation of the performance of meta heuristic trainers as well as ave std in order to see whether the obtained results of ssa differ from other benchmark trainers in a statistically significant way a non parametric statistical test wilcoxon s rank sum test wilcoxon 1945 was accomplished at 5 significance level therefore the obtained p values are shown in the table of results as well in table 6 n a indicates not applicable which means that the specified trainer cannot be compared with itself in the wilcoxon s rank sum test logically p values less than 0 05 are considered as powerful evidence against the null hypothesis therefore p values greater than 0 05 are underlined in the tables another comparative measure shown in the results is classification rate to sum up the ssa has the best convergence rates among other benchmark methods the reason for the improved capability in avoiding local minima is that the salp chain gives ssa more accelerated search in comparison with the popular benchmark trainers in the exploitation phase hence the searching agents are not easily trapped in local minima and reach global minima faster than normal searching agent strategies the results of the sonar target classification show that the mlp ssa outperforms other benchmark trainers the better ave proves that mlp ssa performs better than other classifiers on average and the stds demonstrate that this superiority is stable the results of the p values in table 6 produced from the wilcoxon s rank sum test indicate that the superiority is statistically significant 6 conclusion in this study passive sonar targets were classified by mfccs and mlp networks in this approaches cepstral feature was utilized to alleviate dataset s dimension and mlp network to adapt the variability in changing condition also to overcome the shortcomings of mlp networks the use of the newly introduced salp swarm algorithm was proposed for training mlp network in order to investigate the efficiencies of ssa in training mlp networks four high dimensional benchmark functions as well as an experimental sonar data set were employed the proposed classifier was compared to gwo bbo isa and gmdh benchmark algorithms the results showed that the designed classifier mlp ssa was more efficient than other benchmark algorithms in term of classification accuracy entrapment in local minima and convergence speed the ssa classified sonar data set as much as 0 9017 percent better than gmdh being the best results among the other classifiers in general application of the mlp ssa to investigate the passive sonar targets classification was proven that this algorithm can be used well for classification the changing and high dimensional underwater datasets 
22832,pile foundation is one of the most commonly used foundations for offshore and coastal structures this paper describes an innovative design for the pile foundation which institutes an innovative strategy over traditional pile foundation to achieve higher axial bearing capacity this is achieved by adding restriction plates inside the pile to help form the soil plug a series of geotechnical centrifuge tests are carried out to evaluate the load bearing behaviors of traditional pile foundation and innovative pile foundation with different types of restriction plates the pile diameter and shapes of the restriction plates on the soil plug behaviors and pile load carrying capacity are analyzed the results show that the use of restriction plates could significantly increase the axial bearing capacity of large diameter pile foundations for different pile diameters the restriction plates with four smaller holes achieve better performance than those with one large hole of the same effective opening areas a bearing capacity equation is obtained by normalizing the ultimate bearing capacity with the pile diameters for different restriction plates this study demonstrates the promise of an innovative pile foundation with a restriction plate as an economic and technically feasible way to produce higher load bearing capacity to support offshore and coastal structures keywords offshore structures innovative pile foundation centrifuge test restriction plate 1 introduction pile foundations are widely used in construction for offshore and coastal structures ma et al 2017 oh et al 2018 in china over 5000 steel pipe piles were installed in the construction of hangzhou bay bridge yu and yang 2012 in the united states the use of large open ended pipe piles reduced the foundation construction time by half and led to a cost saving of 2 8 million for a bridge project in california liebich 2009 open ended pipe piles typically referring to pipe piles with a diameter larger than 30 inches offer high capacity and rigidity against uplifting and overturning doherty and gavin 2011 currently the new generation of offshore structures has higher technical requirements due to their larger capacities or the more harsh working conditions which will certainly result in more challenges for the design of the foundations increasing the pile diameter has been found to be an economic and efficient solution for difficult geotechnical and hydrological conditions in transportation projects byrne et al 2015 doherty and gavin 2011 wang et al 2018b besides using as a single foundation the pipe pile is used as the anchors for several foundations such as the group pile foundation and the jacket foundation which are likely to resist very large axial loadings the number of piles used for a bridge or offshore platform can be significantly reduced by using the large diameter open ended pipe piles however the initial cost of steel will increase significantly with the pipe piles with excessive large diameters and the associated construction and installation will be more difficult a national survey in the united states indicates that large diameter pipe piles are considered in the design phase of current or future projects but little previous experience with this type of pile has been collected brown and thompson 2015 therefore the new design of the pile foundation is necessary instead of continuously increasing the pile diameter in this study an innovative large diameter pile with a restriction plate is proposed the design is the modification of the original pipe pile which aims to provide larger bearing capacity in service conditions the interaction mechanism between soil and pile foundation is more complicated due to the formation of a soil column inside the pile known as soil plug during the driving process ko and jeong 2014 wu et al 2017 during the installation process the soil beneath the pile foundation will be squeezed inside the pile which leads to form the soil plug to determine the bearing capacity of the open ended pile could be difficulty involving great uncertainty due to the complicated behavior of soil plugging yu and yang 2012 due to the lateral friction between the soil and the pile internal wall the soil arch may be formed at the bottom of the soil plug which will increase the plug resistance significantly lehane and jardine 1994 o neill and raines 1991 randolph et al 1991 formation of soil arch effects is decided by factors such as pipe pile diameter and characteristics of the soil most of the early stage design criteria predicting the bearing capacity originated from close ended piles which may cause inaccurate results this inspired the community to investigate the bearing behavior of pile foundations and the mechanisms of soil plug de nicola and randolph 1997 jardine 1996 lehane and gavin 2001 paik and salgado 2003 paik et al 2003 on the other hand the current pile design method including american petroleum institute api method imperial college pile icp method university of western australia uwa method norwegian geotechnical institute ngi method etc estimate the soil plug resistance based on empirical data randolph 2003 during installation of pile foundations soil enters the pile until the inner soil cylinder develops sufficient resistance to prevent further soil intrusion and the pile becomes plugged paikowsky and whitman 1990 the soil resistance on the inside of the pile wall increases as the pile is driven deeper until a soil plug is formed which may restrict partially or fully to enter additional soil inside of the pile plugging status of pipe piles has a great influence on the prediction of pile driving resistance and vertical bearing capacity randolph randolph et al 1991 developed a one dimensional analytical model for soil plug in pipe piles the model describes an exponential relationship between the length of the soil plug and the axial resistance the experimental and numerical analyses indicate the existence of soil arching can lead to much higher capacity compared with external friction randolph et al 1992 the degree of plugging in soils depends on several factors such as the type of soil soil density pile surface roughness hammer energy pile embedment depth and pile diameter brucy et al 1991 kraft jr 1991 lee et al 2003 murthy et al 2018 studied the behavior of the formation of soil plug during driving in graded sand they found that for smaller diameter piles the internal friction is higher which leading to a higher degree of plugging this consistent with previous studies that the soil is less likely to plug as the inner diameter of the pile increases yu and yang 2012 the soil plug is more easily to form in the innovative pile foundation with the restriction plate which could lead to an increment of the total vertical bearing capacity centrifuge test is a geotechnical test method to study the complex geotechnical problems reassembling the practice scales by using the centrifuge machine the dimensions of the prototype models used in the laboratory test can be scaled up by applying the gravity acceleration according to the established scaling law the geotechnical centrifuge allows testing small scale models under high gravitational levels to emulate the stress state of field conditions this study describes an extensive amount of geotechnical centrifuge experiments on the static load bearing behaviors of pile foundations with different types of restriction plates a customized loading frame was built to apply static loads a series of experiments have been conducted on pipe piles of different diameters in combination with different types of restriction plates the two types of restriction plates i e restriction plate with one hole restriction plate with four hole with the same total opening area are installed at prescribed depth to analyze their influence on the soil plug formation in this study we set up an experimental system to evaluate the influence of the restriction plate on the loading bearing behaviors of large diameter open ended pipe piles furthermore by testing the models under different gravitational levels the study aims to plot a normalized design chart for traditional open ended pipe piles and piles with restriction plates to give guidance in further design 2 methodology and research background when the open ended steel piles are driven into the ground the soil beneath enters the pipe pile from the pile tip to form a soil plug the total design axial ultimate bearing capacity of the pipe pile qr consists of two parts i e the lateral shaft friction resistance and base capacity as shown in fig 1 which is defined as 1 q r q s q t π d τ z d z π d 2 4 q t where qs is the lateral shaft friction and qt is base capacity τz is the local unit shaft friction qt is the ultimate unit base resistance d is the pipe diameter z is the embedment depth several design criteria of large open ended pipe piles based on the empirical data from pile tests have been listed as follows 2 1 api method american petroleum institute api recommended practice is widely used in offshore platform industry and civil engineering projects rp2a wsd 2000 it estimates the soil plug resistance based on empirical data derived from field projects and experiments it is the basis for estimating axial bearing capacity for offshore engineering the dnv standard dnv 2013 come up with the offshore wind turbine pile foundations axial bearing capacity calculation formula is based on the api method for a pile in stratified soil deposit of n soil layers the pile resistance q t can be expressed as 2 q t i 1 n f s i a s i q t a t where f si is the average unit skin friction along the pile shaft in layer i a si is the shaft area of the pile in layer i q t is the unit end resistance and at is the gross tip area of the pile the soil characteristics have a significant influence on the resistance when using this method for clay the unit shaft friction and the unit tip resistance can be calculated as 3 f s i α s u 4 q t 9 s u where α 0 5 s u p 0 0 5 for s u p 0 1 0 and α 0 5 s u p 0 0 25 for s u p 0 1 0 with the constraint that α 1 0 is the undrained shear strength p 0 is the effective overburden pressure at the calculated point for sand the unit shaft friction and the unit tip resistance can be calculated as 5 f s i k p 0 tan δ 6 q t n t p 0 where k is the coefficient of lateral earth pressure which is assumed to be 0 8 for open ended piles in unplug mode and 1 for close ended piles or plugged open ended piles p0 is the effective overburden pressure δ is the friction angle at the pile soil interface nq is the dimensionless bearing factor 2 2 fhwa method federal highway administration fhwa provides a relatively conservative method for the bearing resistance evaluation of open ended pipe piles the ultimate statist capacity of an open ended pipe pile can be estimated in the following manner paikowsky and whitman 1990 for plugged soil 7 q p l u g g e d f s o a o q t a p for unplugged soil 8 q u n p l u g g e d f s o a o f s i a i q t a t where f so and f si are the unit shaft frictions outside and inside the pile ao and ai are the shaft areas of the pile outside and inside qt is the unit end bearing capacity the bearing capacity calculated using fhwa method is smaller than that of api method because in fhwa method the value of interior unit shaft resistance in the open ended pipe pile is typically on the order of 1 3 to 1 2 the exterior unit shaft resistance 2 3 chinese design code the technical code for building pile foundations research 2008 is the most widely used design criteria of open ended steel pipe piles in china the criteria use empirical equations which parameters are based on laboratory or in situ tests in this method the capacity of the soil plug is simplified as a reduced value of total tip resistance and the reduction factor is controlled by penetration diameter ratios the total bearing resistance of open ended pipe piles is 9 q t q s q t π d f s o i l i λ p q t a t where λ p 0 16 h b d for h b d 5 and λ p 0 8 for h b d 5 l i is the thickness of soil layers λ p is the toe plugging coefficient λ p is 1 for closed ended pipe piles h b is the penetration depth of the pile d is the outer diameter of pipe pile 2 4 icp method imperial college pile icp method also known as marine technology directorate mtd method jardine 1996 was developed from a database of pile load tests and cpt tests yu and yang 2012 by using this method the plugging mode needs to be determined first a pipe pile is determined as unplugged according to the following empirical equations 10 d 2 0 d r 0 3 or d 0 03 q c a where d is the inner diameter of the pile d r is the relative density of the soil near the pile tip q c a is averaged cpt tip resistance over a specified range in the vicinity of the pile base the ultimate unit base resistance of the pile qt corresponding to a pile head displacement of 0 1d is determined by the inner diameter of the pile d and the outer diameter of the pile d as follows 11 unplugged q t 1 d d 2 q c a 12 plugged q t max 0 14 0 25 log d 0 15 1 d d 2 q c a the above mentioned design codes can be classified into two groups in general methods such as api and fhwa methods contains two parts the plug resistance and annulus resistance are calculated first and compared with the toe resistance the smaller value will then be used as the total tip resistance methods such as chinese design code and icp method use equivalent toe resistance the soil plug is simplified as a reduction of the total tip resistance by using the plugging coefficient or based on cpt tests 3 centrifuge experiment setup 3 1 centrifuge test all the pile tests were conducted in a 20 g ton geotechnical centrifuge located at the department of civil engineering case western reserve university a photo of this facility is shown in fig 2 it operates at a centrifugal acceleration of up to 100 g with seismic excitation or 200 g without seismic excitation and the radius of the platform is 1 37 m the detail of the facility has been described fully by figueroa et al 1998 geotechnical centrifuge experiments have been accepted as a cost effective method to study the geotechnical practice problems geotechnical centrifuge allows us using small scale models under high gravitational levels to emulate the behaviors of geo structure close to field stress states chakraborty and salgado 2010 the results are interpreted by means of the centrifuge scaling law wang et al 2018c by use of a reduced scale model the centrifuge tests provide reliable experimental behaviors of geo structures representing the field conditions wang et al 2017a the centrifuge scaling law is presented in table 1 the geotechnical centrifuge test has been proved both cost effective and accurate in testing offshore foundation bearing capacities chenggang and xibao 1998 nicola and randolph 1999 wang et al 2017b c in the first part of this study the maximum gravitational level was set as 50 g which represents a scaling factor of 50 for the data interpretations this setting is firstly for safety consideration moreover the centrifuge tests reported previously in our projects are conducted under a maximum acceleration of 50 g wang et al 2018b 2019a 2019b to make comparisons of different models the maximum 50 g gravitational level is used in order to study the soil plug effect to different diameter piles the models to simulate the piles in different diameter were tested under different gravitational levels of 1 g 10 g and 30 g in the second part of this study to keep the consistency the configurations and test results presented in this paper are in prototype scale which is transferred according to the centrifuge scaling law with the corresponded gravitational accelerations 3 2 description of the innovative pile with the restriction plate it is normally acknowledged that an open ended pile requires less installation effort than a close ended pile under the same soil properties paik and salgado 2003 accordingly open ended pipe piles usually display more settlement compared to the close ended pipe piles during static load tests szechy 1961 wang et al 2018a this is due to the capacity of open ended piles is typically lower than that of close ended piles however for the small diameter pipe piles the soil plug is easily formed due to the soil arch effects this makes them behaviors similar to close ended pipe piles and demonstrates similar load settlement behaviors as the close ended piles with the same diameters the deformation and stress characteristics of soil around pipe piles change with the increase of pile diameter liu et al 2015 and the soil plug is more easily to form in smaller diameter steel piles in this study an innovative pipe pile with a restriction plate is proposed the restriction plate is added inside the pipe pile to enhance the formation and stability of the soil plug restriction plate with two different shapes i e one hole and four hole with same cross section area are studied and compared with the original pipe without any restriction plates the effective opening areas of the one hole plate and four hole plate are equal to each other since the restriction plates have the same total opening area the diameter of the inner hole of one hole restriction plate is half of the diameter of the model pipe pile d d 1 2 and the diameter of the opening hole of four hole restriction plate is fourth of the model pipe pile diameter d d 1 4 as shown in fig 3 by specifying the optimum location of the restriction plate designers may be able to control the bearing resistance as well as drivability of large open ended pipe piles at the same time centrifuge tests were conducted on three comparison groups to determine their load bearing capacity these include pipe pile without restriction plate as the control group the pipe piles with two types i e one hole and four hole restriction plates in order to study the effects of the pile diameter to the restriction plate and ultimate bearing capacity three types of the pile with different diameters i e 0 95 m 1 27 m and 1 90 m were chosen which constitute nine groups of models in total as shown in fig 4 all piles are fabricated uniformly with the same materials and the same thickness the young s modulus of steel provided by the manufacturer is 200 gpa the internal restriction plates are fabricated by the ultimaker 2 3 d printer each pile has a length of 8 65 m with the restriction plate installed at the height of 2 m from the bottom of the pile considering the limitation of the height by the soil container the embedded depth of the pile was set at 4 m with restriction plate installed at 50 of the embedded depth as the pile is driven to the depth of 4 m the restriction plate would be bearing with soil for a driving distance of 2 m the driven depth and location of the restriction plate are kept the same for each model the dimension and parameters of the pipe pile models are summarized in table 2 3 3 soil properties the internal dimensions of the rigid container used for the centrifuge experiments in prototype dimensions are 27 6 m length 12 m width 8 9 m height wang et al 2018c the soil used in this test is silica sand provided by oglebay norton industrial sand inc which is widely used sand from pipe pile tests the particle size of this type of silica sand is very small which could benefit the centrifuge test with fewer scale effects de nicola and randolph 1997 a series of soil mechanics tests are conducted to assess the properties of the soil and the test results are summarized in table 3 the sand was compacted in the container before installing the pile model the total height of the sand was approximately 7 5 m in height in the container the sand is poured into the container and compacted to about 70 in relative density which is classified as dense sand to ensure the identical condition for all the centrifuge tests the soil is newly prepared with the same procedure for each test the dry sand is used in this test for simplification because the loading rate for the static test is low enough to avoid the build up of excess pore water pressure wang et al 2017a the pile was installed in the middle of the container and about 3 5 m above the bottom of the container to reduce the boundary effects randolph et al 1992 the width of the rigid container is 12 05 m which is 6 5 times the largest pile diameter and the tested are conducted under static loadings the boundary effects of the side walls are reduced to an acceptable level wang et al 2017c the pipe is hammered into the sand in the field of pile driving conditions in this study the model installation process simulated the pile driving which installed right under the load cell as shown in fig 5 3 4 static load sequence to extend the centrifuge for this study a loading frame was first designed and fabricated as schematically shown in fig 5 the loading frame works as a reaction beam to apply the load to the model pile the centrifuge test was designed to be load controlled and was applied by an electrical actuator the electrical actuator is fixed vertically above the container and a load cell is fixed at the end of the actuator to monitor the applied load a linear variable displacement transduces lvdt was placed at the same height as the actuator to record the vertical displacement at the top of the pipe pile a clip holder for the pipe pile model was fixed with the load cell at one end and connected with the lvdt at the other side as shown in fig 5 the control function for the load was preprogrammed and input into the control terminal the signal went through a servo amplifier to mobilize the load actuator and the load cell reading was used to control the amplitude of the electric current to achieve the target load by the actuator wang et al 2018b static step load was applied to the pipe pile models by the actuator installed on a customized loading frame to measure the ultimate resistance of the pipe pile models astm 2013 for each loading sequence the load increases systematically until the pile failed and then the unloading sequence follows the time load history was set as step loads according to the range of the load cell and each loading step was held for 4 min astm 2013 altogether the loading process included 6 loading and 4 unloading stages in each test the shape of the applied step load is depicted in fig 6 with an example peak amplitude of 1000 kn several levels of force were chosen in this experiment to compare the load bearing capacity of different pipe pile models all the load time history follows the same process but with different amplitude 4 ultimate bearing capacity experimental results 4 1 test procedure the static load test is firstly conducted to determine the ultimate bearing capacity for each pile model nine centrifuge tests were performed to investigate the function of the restriction plates in increasing the ultimate bearing capacity of the piles in this test the centrifuge is accelerated to 50 g to scale up the model 50 times the static load test is composed of two stages i e loading and unloading stages for the loading stage the step load increases in a continuous way and then keep constant for 4 min to record the corresponding stabilized displacement according to the pile testing standard astm 2013 after the pile reach failure the unloading procedure follows the same pattern as the loading stage until get back to the original point the displacement of the pile increased as the axial load increased and bounced back slightly during the unloading process fig 7 shows the experimental setup of pipe pile models of a different diameter the test details are summarized in table 2 associated with descriptions 4 2 soil plug behavior to understand the soil plug behavior the length of the soil plug was measured after installation of the model fig 8 demonstrates the plug length of the models with a different diameter defined as the length of the soil column formed inside the pile the fully plugged line which equals the pile penetration depth is also plotted as the reference line the three models with different diameter follow the same trend in which the pipe pile has the largest plug length and four hole pile model has the smallest plug length for 0 95 m and 1 27 m diameter pile models the plug length of the one hole model is slightly larger than that of the four hole model this trend is more obvious for the pile with the 1 90 m diameter according to the previous studies de nicola and randolph 1997 matsumoto and takei 1991 the longer plug length means the pile has a lower tendency to plug by comparing models with different diameter the figures show that the plug length of larger diameter models is higher than that of smaller diameter models the phenomenon agrees with the previous studies yu and yang 2012 that the small diameter pile has a greater tendency of forming the soil plug 4 3 failure criteria the davisson criteria davisson 1972 is one of the best known and most widely used failure criteria to analyze the load displacement curve and calculate the ultimate bearing capacity of pipe pile models specifically the modified davisson failure criteria method is used in this study to find the ultimate bearing capacity of pile models the method is recommended by the florida department of transportation ng et al 2004 for large diameter pipe piles the modified davisson s criterion is given in equations 13 and 14 in which the failure displacement equals the elastic deformation of the pile shaft and 1 30 of pile diameter modified davisson s criterion is more commonly used for analyzing the load displacement of pipe piles the ultimate bearing resistance of piles is the intersection point of the p s curve and the modified davisson failure displacement curve 13 s f s e d 30 14 s e p l e a where s f is the maximum movement of pile top based on modified davisson s criteria in mm s e is the elastic deformation of pile in mm d is the pipe diameter in mm p is the applied vertical load l is the length of pile a is the cross section area of pile e is the elastic modulus of pile 4 4 static test results fig 9 a c show the relationship between the axial loads applied to the pile head and the pile settlement of pile models with 0 95 m 1 27 m and 1 90 m diameter respectively for each size of pile model the load displacement curves of three different types of pipe pile including pile without restriction plate pile with one hole restriction plate and pile with four hole restriction plate are plotted together for comparisons the data points represent the readings of loads and settlements at a stabilized period during the 4 min of each step the load settlement curves are almost linear at the beginning and the three piles demonstrate similar behaviors as the axial load increases slopes of the curves decrease significantly the modified davisson failure criteria are proposed to determine the ultimate bearing capacity of the pile as stated in section 4 3 in this study the pile is considered to reach the ultimate condition when the settlement reaches the davisson failure line as shown in fig 9 and the corresponded axial load is the ultimate bearing capacity of the pile for the 1 9 m pile with restriction plates the ultimate bearing resistance is beyond the range of the actuator and therefore the ultimate bearing capacities are estimated by extending the curve the ultimate bearing resistance of the pile models is summarized in table 4 as expected the ultimate bearing capacity of the piles increases with the pile diameter regardless of the restriction plates this phenomenon is attributed to the larger contacting surface with the foundation soil overall the general behaviors of the load settlement curves of the 0 95 m 1 27 m and 1 90 m pile models are quite similar the effect of restriction plates is obvious as shown in table 4 that the use of restriction plate significantly increases the ultimate bearing capacity of pipe piles the four hole plates are more effective than the one hole plate with the same opening area in improving the bearing capacity for all the three different diameter pile models to compare the effects of the pile diameter the percentage of increases in the pile bearing capacity by use of restriction plate compared with open ended pipe piles are also calculated and listed in table 4 the 1 27 m diameter piles showed the largest increment by use of the restriction plates compared to pipe pile for the 1 27 m piles the use of one hole restriction plate or four hole restriction plate increase the ultimate bearing capacity by 100 and 167 respectively compared to the pipe without restriction plate the 1 90 m diameter pile models have the second best performance in increasing the ultimate bearing capacities by using the restriction plate in addition the 0 95 m diameter pile models which is also the smallest diameter pile models have the least increment in ultimate bearing capacities by using the restriction plates for small diameter pipe piles the piles tend to be fully plugged naturally due to soil arch effects therefore the restriction plates are not as effective as in pipe piles with a large diameter while for the pile with a large diameter the restriction plate squeezes the soil particles and provide significant end bearing below the restriction plate the total bearing resistance is a summation of plug bearing annular bearing skin friction and end resistance contributed by the restriction plate for the pipe piles of 1 9 m diameter the restriction plate is not as effective to force soil plug to form as for pipe piles of 1 27 m diameter the results show that the restriction plate is effective in enhancing the pile s ultimate bearing resistance and the four hole plate is more effective the influence of the pile diameter is rather complex as in this case the 1 27 m diameter pile shows the best improvement 5 influence of pipe pile diameter 5 1 variable gravitational test results to investigate the influence of pile dimensions in more details a series of centrifuge tests were conducted under variable gravitational levels including 1 g 10 g and 30 g in these tests the centrifuge is operated under different accelerations to simulate real scale models with different diameter according to the centrifuge scaling law the installation loading and unloading procedure are applied the same as the tests under 50 g the data was interpreted according to the scaling law and hence the pile dimension is multiplied by scaling factors of 1 10 and 30 the results of static load tests for model piles with three different diameters are plotted in figs 10 12 the load displacement curves for the pile with different restriction plates are also plotted for comparison purpose the modified davisson method was used to determine the pile bearing capacities the ultimate bearing capacities of different pipe pile models under different gravitational acceleration levels are summarized in tables 5 7 overall the bearing capacity of the models in different diameters follows the same trend as the results under 50 g in which open ended pipe pile has the smallest bearing resistance and pipe pile with four hole restriction plate has the largest capacity the measured bearing capacity of pile models under different accelerations are compared and analyzed in this section fig 13 shows the variations of ultimate bearing capacities of pipe piles with different restriction plate under different acceleration for pipe piles with different model diameters the ultimate bearing capacities increase with the acceleration level via a power law relationship particularly the pipe pile with four hole restriction plate sees the largest increases the larger g level represents the scaled up of the pile with larger diameters the figure also shows that large diameter pipe piles with restriction plates generally have higher bearing resistances particularly for pipe piles with 4 hole restriction plates 5 2 normalized results the geotechnical centrifuge experiments under different centrifugal accelerations allow the behaviors of pipe pile over a wide range of diameters these model piles from different gravitational level centrifuge experiments contain data that represent the load bearing behaviors of pipe piles of different pile diameters embedment depths and installation depth to pile diameter ratios in order to compare the all the experimental results the pile bearing capacity needs to be normalized by dividing the cross section area of the pile to determine the unit bearing capacity and by the vertical earth pressure at the bottom of the pile to account for the confinement effects by pile embedment depths the ultimate bearing capacity is normalized with the overburden earth pressure acted on the cross section area of the pile eq 15 illustrates the formulas used for the normalization process 15 q u n i t q r a ρ g h where q unit is the normalized unit area ultimate bearing resistance of piles q r is the ultimate bearing resistance of model piles a is the cross section area of pile ρ is soil bulk density and ρ 1 604 g cm3 g is the gravitational acceleration which equals to 9 81 m s2 h is the embedment depth of model piles the model piles at different acceleration levels as shown in fig 13 represent different pile diameters and embedment depths to account for the influence of the pile penetration depths the ultimate bearing capacity of different centrifuge models are normalized by dividing the cross section area of the pipe and the vertical confining pressure at the bottom of the pile embedment depths i e obtaining the unit area bearing capacity therefore the variations of the normalized bearing capacity are plotted against the pile diameters for different types of pipe piles tested as shown in fig 14 the general trend is that the normalized unit area bearing capacity decreases with pile diameter and the normalized unit area bearing capacity is much larger for smaller diameter piles this might because these pipe piles are fully plugged after driven installation the figure also shows that for the same pile diameter the pile with 4 hole restriction plate gives the largest end bearing capacity compared with other models although the total plate area of the one hole plate and four hole plate are the same the soil arching effect should be more obvious for the four hole plate model due to the smaller individual hole consequently the calculation method described in this section is a simplified method and aim to provide a possible initial estimation and initial design guideline for large diameter pipe piles the chart can help design new pile under certain bearing resistance on the other hand the chart can also help to calculate the increment of bearing capacity of old pipe pile by adding a restriction plate however the purpose of this study is to check the effectiveness of this innovative restriction plate model to improve the ultimate bearing capacity of pipe piles more research is needed to further understand the plugging mechanism and optimize the design of the restriction plate i e the opening area and the shape of the plate these results need to be incorporated to further develop the design method for large diameter pipe pile with the restriction plate 6 conclusions in this study an extensive number of geotechnical centrifuge experiments were conducted to analyze the load bearing behaviors of innovative offshore pile foundations the innovative pile foundation uses different types of restriction plates i e one hole and four hole to force the soil plug and achieve higher ultimate bearing capacities pile models with different diameters combined with different types of restriction plates were tested under different centrifuge accelerations the first groups of tests are conducted under 50 g centrifugal accelerations and the ultimate bearing capacities were measured nine different combinations of pipes and restriction plates are tested with the goal to determine ultimate bearing capacities the capacities were determined from the load settlement curves by use of the modified davisson criterion it is found that by use of restriction plates the ultimate bearing capacity increased significantly compared with the corresponding open ended piles the second groups of the test were conducted to study the bearing capacity of piles of different diameters the results showed that the ultimate bearing capacity of different types of pipe piles increased with the centrifuge acceleration or prototype diameter by following a power law relationship to evaluate the influence of soil plug the equivalent end bearing resistance of each model pile was calculated by subtracting the shaft resistance from the total bearing capacity the unit bearing capacities are normalized by the pile diameter the major conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the soil plug has a significant contribution to the total ultimate bearing capacity of open ended pipe piles by use of the restriction plate the soil plug can be forced inside the pipe pile which can increase the ultimate bearing capacities of pipe piles by proper selection of restriction plate geometry an optimal design balancing the ultimate resistance and drivability could be achieved 2 the soil plug is easier to form with smaller diameter pipe piles four hole restriction plate mobilizes more end bearing than the one hole restriction plate models with the same effective opening plate area 3 the ultimate bearing capacities of models under different gradational levels of centrifuge experiments are normalized and compared the ultimate bearing resistance has a power law relationship with pipe pile diameter 4 procedures are proposed to estimate the bearing capacity of the pile with the one hole restriction plate and pile with four hole restriction plate by applying the capacity of close ended pipe pile and scale factor overall this study is the first one to investigate the behaviors of the innovative pile foundations with restriction plates and provide insights into the behaviors of forming the soil plug the experimental observations were summarized into a design chart which could give guidance to design the pile foundation with a restriction plate which is promising for offshore applications the study is needed to further understand the soil plug mechanism and optimize the design of the restriction plate acknowledgments this work was funded in part by the ohio department of transportation and the u s federal highway administration the support is highly appreciated 
22832,pile foundation is one of the most commonly used foundations for offshore and coastal structures this paper describes an innovative design for the pile foundation which institutes an innovative strategy over traditional pile foundation to achieve higher axial bearing capacity this is achieved by adding restriction plates inside the pile to help form the soil plug a series of geotechnical centrifuge tests are carried out to evaluate the load bearing behaviors of traditional pile foundation and innovative pile foundation with different types of restriction plates the pile diameter and shapes of the restriction plates on the soil plug behaviors and pile load carrying capacity are analyzed the results show that the use of restriction plates could significantly increase the axial bearing capacity of large diameter pile foundations for different pile diameters the restriction plates with four smaller holes achieve better performance than those with one large hole of the same effective opening areas a bearing capacity equation is obtained by normalizing the ultimate bearing capacity with the pile diameters for different restriction plates this study demonstrates the promise of an innovative pile foundation with a restriction plate as an economic and technically feasible way to produce higher load bearing capacity to support offshore and coastal structures keywords offshore structures innovative pile foundation centrifuge test restriction plate 1 introduction pile foundations are widely used in construction for offshore and coastal structures ma et al 2017 oh et al 2018 in china over 5000 steel pipe piles were installed in the construction of hangzhou bay bridge yu and yang 2012 in the united states the use of large open ended pipe piles reduced the foundation construction time by half and led to a cost saving of 2 8 million for a bridge project in california liebich 2009 open ended pipe piles typically referring to pipe piles with a diameter larger than 30 inches offer high capacity and rigidity against uplifting and overturning doherty and gavin 2011 currently the new generation of offshore structures has higher technical requirements due to their larger capacities or the more harsh working conditions which will certainly result in more challenges for the design of the foundations increasing the pile diameter has been found to be an economic and efficient solution for difficult geotechnical and hydrological conditions in transportation projects byrne et al 2015 doherty and gavin 2011 wang et al 2018b besides using as a single foundation the pipe pile is used as the anchors for several foundations such as the group pile foundation and the jacket foundation which are likely to resist very large axial loadings the number of piles used for a bridge or offshore platform can be significantly reduced by using the large diameter open ended pipe piles however the initial cost of steel will increase significantly with the pipe piles with excessive large diameters and the associated construction and installation will be more difficult a national survey in the united states indicates that large diameter pipe piles are considered in the design phase of current or future projects but little previous experience with this type of pile has been collected brown and thompson 2015 therefore the new design of the pile foundation is necessary instead of continuously increasing the pile diameter in this study an innovative large diameter pile with a restriction plate is proposed the design is the modification of the original pipe pile which aims to provide larger bearing capacity in service conditions the interaction mechanism between soil and pile foundation is more complicated due to the formation of a soil column inside the pile known as soil plug during the driving process ko and jeong 2014 wu et al 2017 during the installation process the soil beneath the pile foundation will be squeezed inside the pile which leads to form the soil plug to determine the bearing capacity of the open ended pile could be difficulty involving great uncertainty due to the complicated behavior of soil plugging yu and yang 2012 due to the lateral friction between the soil and the pile internal wall the soil arch may be formed at the bottom of the soil plug which will increase the plug resistance significantly lehane and jardine 1994 o neill and raines 1991 randolph et al 1991 formation of soil arch effects is decided by factors such as pipe pile diameter and characteristics of the soil most of the early stage design criteria predicting the bearing capacity originated from close ended piles which may cause inaccurate results this inspired the community to investigate the bearing behavior of pile foundations and the mechanisms of soil plug de nicola and randolph 1997 jardine 1996 lehane and gavin 2001 paik and salgado 2003 paik et al 2003 on the other hand the current pile design method including american petroleum institute api method imperial college pile icp method university of western australia uwa method norwegian geotechnical institute ngi method etc estimate the soil plug resistance based on empirical data randolph 2003 during installation of pile foundations soil enters the pile until the inner soil cylinder develops sufficient resistance to prevent further soil intrusion and the pile becomes plugged paikowsky and whitman 1990 the soil resistance on the inside of the pile wall increases as the pile is driven deeper until a soil plug is formed which may restrict partially or fully to enter additional soil inside of the pile plugging status of pipe piles has a great influence on the prediction of pile driving resistance and vertical bearing capacity randolph randolph et al 1991 developed a one dimensional analytical model for soil plug in pipe piles the model describes an exponential relationship between the length of the soil plug and the axial resistance the experimental and numerical analyses indicate the existence of soil arching can lead to much higher capacity compared with external friction randolph et al 1992 the degree of plugging in soils depends on several factors such as the type of soil soil density pile surface roughness hammer energy pile embedment depth and pile diameter brucy et al 1991 kraft jr 1991 lee et al 2003 murthy et al 2018 studied the behavior of the formation of soil plug during driving in graded sand they found that for smaller diameter piles the internal friction is higher which leading to a higher degree of plugging this consistent with previous studies that the soil is less likely to plug as the inner diameter of the pile increases yu and yang 2012 the soil plug is more easily to form in the innovative pile foundation with the restriction plate which could lead to an increment of the total vertical bearing capacity centrifuge test is a geotechnical test method to study the complex geotechnical problems reassembling the practice scales by using the centrifuge machine the dimensions of the prototype models used in the laboratory test can be scaled up by applying the gravity acceleration according to the established scaling law the geotechnical centrifuge allows testing small scale models under high gravitational levels to emulate the stress state of field conditions this study describes an extensive amount of geotechnical centrifuge experiments on the static load bearing behaviors of pile foundations with different types of restriction plates a customized loading frame was built to apply static loads a series of experiments have been conducted on pipe piles of different diameters in combination with different types of restriction plates the two types of restriction plates i e restriction plate with one hole restriction plate with four hole with the same total opening area are installed at prescribed depth to analyze their influence on the soil plug formation in this study we set up an experimental system to evaluate the influence of the restriction plate on the loading bearing behaviors of large diameter open ended pipe piles furthermore by testing the models under different gravitational levels the study aims to plot a normalized design chart for traditional open ended pipe piles and piles with restriction plates to give guidance in further design 2 methodology and research background when the open ended steel piles are driven into the ground the soil beneath enters the pipe pile from the pile tip to form a soil plug the total design axial ultimate bearing capacity of the pipe pile qr consists of two parts i e the lateral shaft friction resistance and base capacity as shown in fig 1 which is defined as 1 q r q s q t π d τ z d z π d 2 4 q t where qs is the lateral shaft friction and qt is base capacity τz is the local unit shaft friction qt is the ultimate unit base resistance d is the pipe diameter z is the embedment depth several design criteria of large open ended pipe piles based on the empirical data from pile tests have been listed as follows 2 1 api method american petroleum institute api recommended practice is widely used in offshore platform industry and civil engineering projects rp2a wsd 2000 it estimates the soil plug resistance based on empirical data derived from field projects and experiments it is the basis for estimating axial bearing capacity for offshore engineering the dnv standard dnv 2013 come up with the offshore wind turbine pile foundations axial bearing capacity calculation formula is based on the api method for a pile in stratified soil deposit of n soil layers the pile resistance q t can be expressed as 2 q t i 1 n f s i a s i q t a t where f si is the average unit skin friction along the pile shaft in layer i a si is the shaft area of the pile in layer i q t is the unit end resistance and at is the gross tip area of the pile the soil characteristics have a significant influence on the resistance when using this method for clay the unit shaft friction and the unit tip resistance can be calculated as 3 f s i α s u 4 q t 9 s u where α 0 5 s u p 0 0 5 for s u p 0 1 0 and α 0 5 s u p 0 0 25 for s u p 0 1 0 with the constraint that α 1 0 is the undrained shear strength p 0 is the effective overburden pressure at the calculated point for sand the unit shaft friction and the unit tip resistance can be calculated as 5 f s i k p 0 tan δ 6 q t n t p 0 where k is the coefficient of lateral earth pressure which is assumed to be 0 8 for open ended piles in unplug mode and 1 for close ended piles or plugged open ended piles p0 is the effective overburden pressure δ is the friction angle at the pile soil interface nq is the dimensionless bearing factor 2 2 fhwa method federal highway administration fhwa provides a relatively conservative method for the bearing resistance evaluation of open ended pipe piles the ultimate statist capacity of an open ended pipe pile can be estimated in the following manner paikowsky and whitman 1990 for plugged soil 7 q p l u g g e d f s o a o q t a p for unplugged soil 8 q u n p l u g g e d f s o a o f s i a i q t a t where f so and f si are the unit shaft frictions outside and inside the pile ao and ai are the shaft areas of the pile outside and inside qt is the unit end bearing capacity the bearing capacity calculated using fhwa method is smaller than that of api method because in fhwa method the value of interior unit shaft resistance in the open ended pipe pile is typically on the order of 1 3 to 1 2 the exterior unit shaft resistance 2 3 chinese design code the technical code for building pile foundations research 2008 is the most widely used design criteria of open ended steel pipe piles in china the criteria use empirical equations which parameters are based on laboratory or in situ tests in this method the capacity of the soil plug is simplified as a reduced value of total tip resistance and the reduction factor is controlled by penetration diameter ratios the total bearing resistance of open ended pipe piles is 9 q t q s q t π d f s o i l i λ p q t a t where λ p 0 16 h b d for h b d 5 and λ p 0 8 for h b d 5 l i is the thickness of soil layers λ p is the toe plugging coefficient λ p is 1 for closed ended pipe piles h b is the penetration depth of the pile d is the outer diameter of pipe pile 2 4 icp method imperial college pile icp method also known as marine technology directorate mtd method jardine 1996 was developed from a database of pile load tests and cpt tests yu and yang 2012 by using this method the plugging mode needs to be determined first a pipe pile is determined as unplugged according to the following empirical equations 10 d 2 0 d r 0 3 or d 0 03 q c a where d is the inner diameter of the pile d r is the relative density of the soil near the pile tip q c a is averaged cpt tip resistance over a specified range in the vicinity of the pile base the ultimate unit base resistance of the pile qt corresponding to a pile head displacement of 0 1d is determined by the inner diameter of the pile d and the outer diameter of the pile d as follows 11 unplugged q t 1 d d 2 q c a 12 plugged q t max 0 14 0 25 log d 0 15 1 d d 2 q c a the above mentioned design codes can be classified into two groups in general methods such as api and fhwa methods contains two parts the plug resistance and annulus resistance are calculated first and compared with the toe resistance the smaller value will then be used as the total tip resistance methods such as chinese design code and icp method use equivalent toe resistance the soil plug is simplified as a reduction of the total tip resistance by using the plugging coefficient or based on cpt tests 3 centrifuge experiment setup 3 1 centrifuge test all the pile tests were conducted in a 20 g ton geotechnical centrifuge located at the department of civil engineering case western reserve university a photo of this facility is shown in fig 2 it operates at a centrifugal acceleration of up to 100 g with seismic excitation or 200 g without seismic excitation and the radius of the platform is 1 37 m the detail of the facility has been described fully by figueroa et al 1998 geotechnical centrifuge experiments have been accepted as a cost effective method to study the geotechnical practice problems geotechnical centrifuge allows us using small scale models under high gravitational levels to emulate the behaviors of geo structure close to field stress states chakraborty and salgado 2010 the results are interpreted by means of the centrifuge scaling law wang et al 2018c by use of a reduced scale model the centrifuge tests provide reliable experimental behaviors of geo structures representing the field conditions wang et al 2017a the centrifuge scaling law is presented in table 1 the geotechnical centrifuge test has been proved both cost effective and accurate in testing offshore foundation bearing capacities chenggang and xibao 1998 nicola and randolph 1999 wang et al 2017b c in the first part of this study the maximum gravitational level was set as 50 g which represents a scaling factor of 50 for the data interpretations this setting is firstly for safety consideration moreover the centrifuge tests reported previously in our projects are conducted under a maximum acceleration of 50 g wang et al 2018b 2019a 2019b to make comparisons of different models the maximum 50 g gravitational level is used in order to study the soil plug effect to different diameter piles the models to simulate the piles in different diameter were tested under different gravitational levels of 1 g 10 g and 30 g in the second part of this study to keep the consistency the configurations and test results presented in this paper are in prototype scale which is transferred according to the centrifuge scaling law with the corresponded gravitational accelerations 3 2 description of the innovative pile with the restriction plate it is normally acknowledged that an open ended pile requires less installation effort than a close ended pile under the same soil properties paik and salgado 2003 accordingly open ended pipe piles usually display more settlement compared to the close ended pipe piles during static load tests szechy 1961 wang et al 2018a this is due to the capacity of open ended piles is typically lower than that of close ended piles however for the small diameter pipe piles the soil plug is easily formed due to the soil arch effects this makes them behaviors similar to close ended pipe piles and demonstrates similar load settlement behaviors as the close ended piles with the same diameters the deformation and stress characteristics of soil around pipe piles change with the increase of pile diameter liu et al 2015 and the soil plug is more easily to form in smaller diameter steel piles in this study an innovative pipe pile with a restriction plate is proposed the restriction plate is added inside the pipe pile to enhance the formation and stability of the soil plug restriction plate with two different shapes i e one hole and four hole with same cross section area are studied and compared with the original pipe without any restriction plates the effective opening areas of the one hole plate and four hole plate are equal to each other since the restriction plates have the same total opening area the diameter of the inner hole of one hole restriction plate is half of the diameter of the model pipe pile d d 1 2 and the diameter of the opening hole of four hole restriction plate is fourth of the model pipe pile diameter d d 1 4 as shown in fig 3 by specifying the optimum location of the restriction plate designers may be able to control the bearing resistance as well as drivability of large open ended pipe piles at the same time centrifuge tests were conducted on three comparison groups to determine their load bearing capacity these include pipe pile without restriction plate as the control group the pipe piles with two types i e one hole and four hole restriction plates in order to study the effects of the pile diameter to the restriction plate and ultimate bearing capacity three types of the pile with different diameters i e 0 95 m 1 27 m and 1 90 m were chosen which constitute nine groups of models in total as shown in fig 4 all piles are fabricated uniformly with the same materials and the same thickness the young s modulus of steel provided by the manufacturer is 200 gpa the internal restriction plates are fabricated by the ultimaker 2 3 d printer each pile has a length of 8 65 m with the restriction plate installed at the height of 2 m from the bottom of the pile considering the limitation of the height by the soil container the embedded depth of the pile was set at 4 m with restriction plate installed at 50 of the embedded depth as the pile is driven to the depth of 4 m the restriction plate would be bearing with soil for a driving distance of 2 m the driven depth and location of the restriction plate are kept the same for each model the dimension and parameters of the pipe pile models are summarized in table 2 3 3 soil properties the internal dimensions of the rigid container used for the centrifuge experiments in prototype dimensions are 27 6 m length 12 m width 8 9 m height wang et al 2018c the soil used in this test is silica sand provided by oglebay norton industrial sand inc which is widely used sand from pipe pile tests the particle size of this type of silica sand is very small which could benefit the centrifuge test with fewer scale effects de nicola and randolph 1997 a series of soil mechanics tests are conducted to assess the properties of the soil and the test results are summarized in table 3 the sand was compacted in the container before installing the pile model the total height of the sand was approximately 7 5 m in height in the container the sand is poured into the container and compacted to about 70 in relative density which is classified as dense sand to ensure the identical condition for all the centrifuge tests the soil is newly prepared with the same procedure for each test the dry sand is used in this test for simplification because the loading rate for the static test is low enough to avoid the build up of excess pore water pressure wang et al 2017a the pile was installed in the middle of the container and about 3 5 m above the bottom of the container to reduce the boundary effects randolph et al 1992 the width of the rigid container is 12 05 m which is 6 5 times the largest pile diameter and the tested are conducted under static loadings the boundary effects of the side walls are reduced to an acceptable level wang et al 2017c the pipe is hammered into the sand in the field of pile driving conditions in this study the model installation process simulated the pile driving which installed right under the load cell as shown in fig 5 3 4 static load sequence to extend the centrifuge for this study a loading frame was first designed and fabricated as schematically shown in fig 5 the loading frame works as a reaction beam to apply the load to the model pile the centrifuge test was designed to be load controlled and was applied by an electrical actuator the electrical actuator is fixed vertically above the container and a load cell is fixed at the end of the actuator to monitor the applied load a linear variable displacement transduces lvdt was placed at the same height as the actuator to record the vertical displacement at the top of the pipe pile a clip holder for the pipe pile model was fixed with the load cell at one end and connected with the lvdt at the other side as shown in fig 5 the control function for the load was preprogrammed and input into the control terminal the signal went through a servo amplifier to mobilize the load actuator and the load cell reading was used to control the amplitude of the electric current to achieve the target load by the actuator wang et al 2018b static step load was applied to the pipe pile models by the actuator installed on a customized loading frame to measure the ultimate resistance of the pipe pile models astm 2013 for each loading sequence the load increases systematically until the pile failed and then the unloading sequence follows the time load history was set as step loads according to the range of the load cell and each loading step was held for 4 min astm 2013 altogether the loading process included 6 loading and 4 unloading stages in each test the shape of the applied step load is depicted in fig 6 with an example peak amplitude of 1000 kn several levels of force were chosen in this experiment to compare the load bearing capacity of different pipe pile models all the load time history follows the same process but with different amplitude 4 ultimate bearing capacity experimental results 4 1 test procedure the static load test is firstly conducted to determine the ultimate bearing capacity for each pile model nine centrifuge tests were performed to investigate the function of the restriction plates in increasing the ultimate bearing capacity of the piles in this test the centrifuge is accelerated to 50 g to scale up the model 50 times the static load test is composed of two stages i e loading and unloading stages for the loading stage the step load increases in a continuous way and then keep constant for 4 min to record the corresponding stabilized displacement according to the pile testing standard astm 2013 after the pile reach failure the unloading procedure follows the same pattern as the loading stage until get back to the original point the displacement of the pile increased as the axial load increased and bounced back slightly during the unloading process fig 7 shows the experimental setup of pipe pile models of a different diameter the test details are summarized in table 2 associated with descriptions 4 2 soil plug behavior to understand the soil plug behavior the length of the soil plug was measured after installation of the model fig 8 demonstrates the plug length of the models with a different diameter defined as the length of the soil column formed inside the pile the fully plugged line which equals the pile penetration depth is also plotted as the reference line the three models with different diameter follow the same trend in which the pipe pile has the largest plug length and four hole pile model has the smallest plug length for 0 95 m and 1 27 m diameter pile models the plug length of the one hole model is slightly larger than that of the four hole model this trend is more obvious for the pile with the 1 90 m diameter according to the previous studies de nicola and randolph 1997 matsumoto and takei 1991 the longer plug length means the pile has a lower tendency to plug by comparing models with different diameter the figures show that the plug length of larger diameter models is higher than that of smaller diameter models the phenomenon agrees with the previous studies yu and yang 2012 that the small diameter pile has a greater tendency of forming the soil plug 4 3 failure criteria the davisson criteria davisson 1972 is one of the best known and most widely used failure criteria to analyze the load displacement curve and calculate the ultimate bearing capacity of pipe pile models specifically the modified davisson failure criteria method is used in this study to find the ultimate bearing capacity of pile models the method is recommended by the florida department of transportation ng et al 2004 for large diameter pipe piles the modified davisson s criterion is given in equations 13 and 14 in which the failure displacement equals the elastic deformation of the pile shaft and 1 30 of pile diameter modified davisson s criterion is more commonly used for analyzing the load displacement of pipe piles the ultimate bearing resistance of piles is the intersection point of the p s curve and the modified davisson failure displacement curve 13 s f s e d 30 14 s e p l e a where s f is the maximum movement of pile top based on modified davisson s criteria in mm s e is the elastic deformation of pile in mm d is the pipe diameter in mm p is the applied vertical load l is the length of pile a is the cross section area of pile e is the elastic modulus of pile 4 4 static test results fig 9 a c show the relationship between the axial loads applied to the pile head and the pile settlement of pile models with 0 95 m 1 27 m and 1 90 m diameter respectively for each size of pile model the load displacement curves of three different types of pipe pile including pile without restriction plate pile with one hole restriction plate and pile with four hole restriction plate are plotted together for comparisons the data points represent the readings of loads and settlements at a stabilized period during the 4 min of each step the load settlement curves are almost linear at the beginning and the three piles demonstrate similar behaviors as the axial load increases slopes of the curves decrease significantly the modified davisson failure criteria are proposed to determine the ultimate bearing capacity of the pile as stated in section 4 3 in this study the pile is considered to reach the ultimate condition when the settlement reaches the davisson failure line as shown in fig 9 and the corresponded axial load is the ultimate bearing capacity of the pile for the 1 9 m pile with restriction plates the ultimate bearing resistance is beyond the range of the actuator and therefore the ultimate bearing capacities are estimated by extending the curve the ultimate bearing resistance of the pile models is summarized in table 4 as expected the ultimate bearing capacity of the piles increases with the pile diameter regardless of the restriction plates this phenomenon is attributed to the larger contacting surface with the foundation soil overall the general behaviors of the load settlement curves of the 0 95 m 1 27 m and 1 90 m pile models are quite similar the effect of restriction plates is obvious as shown in table 4 that the use of restriction plate significantly increases the ultimate bearing capacity of pipe piles the four hole plates are more effective than the one hole plate with the same opening area in improving the bearing capacity for all the three different diameter pile models to compare the effects of the pile diameter the percentage of increases in the pile bearing capacity by use of restriction plate compared with open ended pipe piles are also calculated and listed in table 4 the 1 27 m diameter piles showed the largest increment by use of the restriction plates compared to pipe pile for the 1 27 m piles the use of one hole restriction plate or four hole restriction plate increase the ultimate bearing capacity by 100 and 167 respectively compared to the pipe without restriction plate the 1 90 m diameter pile models have the second best performance in increasing the ultimate bearing capacities by using the restriction plate in addition the 0 95 m diameter pile models which is also the smallest diameter pile models have the least increment in ultimate bearing capacities by using the restriction plates for small diameter pipe piles the piles tend to be fully plugged naturally due to soil arch effects therefore the restriction plates are not as effective as in pipe piles with a large diameter while for the pile with a large diameter the restriction plate squeezes the soil particles and provide significant end bearing below the restriction plate the total bearing resistance is a summation of plug bearing annular bearing skin friction and end resistance contributed by the restriction plate for the pipe piles of 1 9 m diameter the restriction plate is not as effective to force soil plug to form as for pipe piles of 1 27 m diameter the results show that the restriction plate is effective in enhancing the pile s ultimate bearing resistance and the four hole plate is more effective the influence of the pile diameter is rather complex as in this case the 1 27 m diameter pile shows the best improvement 5 influence of pipe pile diameter 5 1 variable gravitational test results to investigate the influence of pile dimensions in more details a series of centrifuge tests were conducted under variable gravitational levels including 1 g 10 g and 30 g in these tests the centrifuge is operated under different accelerations to simulate real scale models with different diameter according to the centrifuge scaling law the installation loading and unloading procedure are applied the same as the tests under 50 g the data was interpreted according to the scaling law and hence the pile dimension is multiplied by scaling factors of 1 10 and 30 the results of static load tests for model piles with three different diameters are plotted in figs 10 12 the load displacement curves for the pile with different restriction plates are also plotted for comparison purpose the modified davisson method was used to determine the pile bearing capacities the ultimate bearing capacities of different pipe pile models under different gravitational acceleration levels are summarized in tables 5 7 overall the bearing capacity of the models in different diameters follows the same trend as the results under 50 g in which open ended pipe pile has the smallest bearing resistance and pipe pile with four hole restriction plate has the largest capacity the measured bearing capacity of pile models under different accelerations are compared and analyzed in this section fig 13 shows the variations of ultimate bearing capacities of pipe piles with different restriction plate under different acceleration for pipe piles with different model diameters the ultimate bearing capacities increase with the acceleration level via a power law relationship particularly the pipe pile with four hole restriction plate sees the largest increases the larger g level represents the scaled up of the pile with larger diameters the figure also shows that large diameter pipe piles with restriction plates generally have higher bearing resistances particularly for pipe piles with 4 hole restriction plates 5 2 normalized results the geotechnical centrifuge experiments under different centrifugal accelerations allow the behaviors of pipe pile over a wide range of diameters these model piles from different gravitational level centrifuge experiments contain data that represent the load bearing behaviors of pipe piles of different pile diameters embedment depths and installation depth to pile diameter ratios in order to compare the all the experimental results the pile bearing capacity needs to be normalized by dividing the cross section area of the pile to determine the unit bearing capacity and by the vertical earth pressure at the bottom of the pile to account for the confinement effects by pile embedment depths the ultimate bearing capacity is normalized with the overburden earth pressure acted on the cross section area of the pile eq 15 illustrates the formulas used for the normalization process 15 q u n i t q r a ρ g h where q unit is the normalized unit area ultimate bearing resistance of piles q r is the ultimate bearing resistance of model piles a is the cross section area of pile ρ is soil bulk density and ρ 1 604 g cm3 g is the gravitational acceleration which equals to 9 81 m s2 h is the embedment depth of model piles the model piles at different acceleration levels as shown in fig 13 represent different pile diameters and embedment depths to account for the influence of the pile penetration depths the ultimate bearing capacity of different centrifuge models are normalized by dividing the cross section area of the pipe and the vertical confining pressure at the bottom of the pile embedment depths i e obtaining the unit area bearing capacity therefore the variations of the normalized bearing capacity are plotted against the pile diameters for different types of pipe piles tested as shown in fig 14 the general trend is that the normalized unit area bearing capacity decreases with pile diameter and the normalized unit area bearing capacity is much larger for smaller diameter piles this might because these pipe piles are fully plugged after driven installation the figure also shows that for the same pile diameter the pile with 4 hole restriction plate gives the largest end bearing capacity compared with other models although the total plate area of the one hole plate and four hole plate are the same the soil arching effect should be more obvious for the four hole plate model due to the smaller individual hole consequently the calculation method described in this section is a simplified method and aim to provide a possible initial estimation and initial design guideline for large diameter pipe piles the chart can help design new pile under certain bearing resistance on the other hand the chart can also help to calculate the increment of bearing capacity of old pipe pile by adding a restriction plate however the purpose of this study is to check the effectiveness of this innovative restriction plate model to improve the ultimate bearing capacity of pipe piles more research is needed to further understand the plugging mechanism and optimize the design of the restriction plate i e the opening area and the shape of the plate these results need to be incorporated to further develop the design method for large diameter pipe pile with the restriction plate 6 conclusions in this study an extensive number of geotechnical centrifuge experiments were conducted to analyze the load bearing behaviors of innovative offshore pile foundations the innovative pile foundation uses different types of restriction plates i e one hole and four hole to force the soil plug and achieve higher ultimate bearing capacities pile models with different diameters combined with different types of restriction plates were tested under different centrifuge accelerations the first groups of tests are conducted under 50 g centrifugal accelerations and the ultimate bearing capacities were measured nine different combinations of pipes and restriction plates are tested with the goal to determine ultimate bearing capacities the capacities were determined from the load settlement curves by use of the modified davisson criterion it is found that by use of restriction plates the ultimate bearing capacity increased significantly compared with the corresponding open ended piles the second groups of the test were conducted to study the bearing capacity of piles of different diameters the results showed that the ultimate bearing capacity of different types of pipe piles increased with the centrifuge acceleration or prototype diameter by following a power law relationship to evaluate the influence of soil plug the equivalent end bearing resistance of each model pile was calculated by subtracting the shaft resistance from the total bearing capacity the unit bearing capacities are normalized by the pile diameter the major conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the soil plug has a significant contribution to the total ultimate bearing capacity of open ended pipe piles by use of the restriction plate the soil plug can be forced inside the pipe pile which can increase the ultimate bearing capacities of pipe piles by proper selection of restriction plate geometry an optimal design balancing the ultimate resistance and drivability could be achieved 2 the soil plug is easier to form with smaller diameter pipe piles four hole restriction plate mobilizes more end bearing than the one hole restriction plate models with the same effective opening plate area 3 the ultimate bearing capacities of models under different gradational levels of centrifuge experiments are normalized and compared the ultimate bearing resistance has a power law relationship with pipe pile diameter 4 procedures are proposed to estimate the bearing capacity of the pile with the one hole restriction plate and pile with four hole restriction plate by applying the capacity of close ended pipe pile and scale factor overall this study is the first one to investigate the behaviors of the innovative pile foundations with restriction plates and provide insights into the behaviors of forming the soil plug the experimental observations were summarized into a design chart which could give guidance to design the pile foundation with a restriction plate which is promising for offshore applications the study is needed to further understand the soil plug mechanism and optimize the design of the restriction plate acknowledgments this work was funded in part by the ohio department of

22833,polymer grouting technology is a cost effective and trenchless method for repairing leakage and subsidence of drainage pipelines this paper reports the results of a full scale experimental approach in the field where we tested the structural dynamic responses before and after polymer grouting trenchless repairing of a reinforced concrete drainage pipeline of 700 mm inner diameter buried in dense soil and subjected to both surface impact loads and driving loads the dynamic changes of three types of pipeline the normal pipeline disengaged pipeline and polymer repaired pipeline is reported in detail in this paper for different soil cover depths types and magnitudes of loads and locations the results show that under the surface load of the soil the pipe experiences compression at its crown and bottom and tension at its springlines on both sides moreover the circumferential stress is greater than its longitudinal stress an additional impact load or driving load has its greatest influence within 3 m on both sides of its point of action the bell and spigot joints are the most vulnerable places in the pipeline there the vertical displacement is discontinuous and relatively large when extra loads are applied the dynamic response of the pipeline is greater to impact loads than to actual driving loads of comparable magnitude uneven pavement also enhances the response of a buried pipeline to the surface traffic load pipeline disengagement has a substantial negative effect on the overall mechanical resilience of the pipeline however polymer grouting can repair a disengaged pipeline effectively even restoring its mechanical behavior to that of a normal pipeline keywords pipeline damage pipeline repair drainage pipeline polymer grouting trenchless rehabilitation 1 introduction reinforced concrete pipes are currently the most widely used in municipal drainage applications as of 2015 the total length of drainage pipes in large and medium sized cities in china exceeded 500 000 km fang et al 2018 accidents in these pipes such as leakage subsidence disengagement and fractures are not uncommon and can lead to undesirable consequences such as pavement collapse traffic congestion damage to above ground structures and groundwater contamination all of which adversely affect people s lives and productivity xu et al 2017 researchers in china and other countries have carried out many studies of the mechanical properties of pipelines for example liu 2007 established an analytical model and calculational method for the interaction between buried pipelines and soil and obtained a series of encouraging theoretical solutions all however based on the study of static force and deformation arzaghi et al 2018 using a dynamic bayesian network dbn methodology proposed a novel probabilistic methodology for integrated modelling of pitting and corrosion fatigue degradation processes of subsea pipelines a closed circuit television system cctv used by buco et al 2006 to test an 1800 km sewer pipe network revealed that 27 of the defects in the concrete pipe were related to displacement or opening of joints failure of a joint leads to leakage from the pipe and erosion of the supporting soil causing subsidence of the pipeline which in turn gives rise to pavement collapse sheldon et al 2015 carried out field performance tests of existing pipelines under different load conditions and studied the displacement of the pipeline joints under both static and dynamic loads traffic loads tend to have the greatest impact on buried pipeline mccann et al 2018 conducted an experiments to investigate the influence of the thickness of polymer field joint coatings on the behavior of pipeline joints when being bent during reeling operations hyodo and yasuhara 1990 measured the additional vertical stress generated over time by vehicle loads at different depths which can be modeled as a half wave sinusoid most of the reported studies analyze the stress characteristics of buried pipeline and investigate damage tests but few examine the repair of disengaged pipeline traditional repair methods cannot lift a subsided pipe section or reinforce a weak foundation and so leave the possibility of secondary subsidence which can cause a pipeline joint to be dislocated again resulting in leakage sandblasting and other damage fang et al 2018 wang et al 2015a polymer grouting technology is a rapid repair and reinforcement technology for pipelines it makes use of a self expanding anhydrous reactive polymer material and can be injected as a two component polymer material outside the pipe wall it expands and solidifies rapidly after its reaction as shown in fig 1 it can reinforce a foundation and or lift a disengaged pipe its advantages include the following guo and wang 2012 naudts 2003 shi et al 2010 wang et al 2015a 2015b xu et al 2012 the technology has already been successfully applied to the reinforcement and repair of underground structures such as roads tunnels dams and some pipelines based on three dimensional numerical simulation fang et al 2018 explored the mechanical properties of drainage pipelines before and after polymer grouting xu et al 2017 used abaqus finite element simulation to analyze the static and seismic loading effects on a subsidence pipeline before and after polymer grouting repair wang et al 2018 analyzed the dynamic response of pipelines under traffic loads based on the finite element method fem odina et al 2018 built a fem to evaluate the structural response of a cra lined pipeline that subjected to external impact loads the results of the above numerical model analyses still lack the verification of field test data based on previous studies and considering the conditions of normal disengaged and polymer repaired reinforced concrete drainage pipes with flexible joints this paper reports a full scale test in a relatively controlled environment and explores the mechanical properties of pipelines at different soil cover depths load sizes locations and types of driving conditions under both impact load and driving load the results should provide helpful data for future numerical analyses 2 full scale experiment details 2 1 test configuration the tests were carried out in a relatively open outdoor area surrounded by residential areas with no large scale mechanical construction operations in the vicinity so that the tests were largely free of outside interference relatively flat ground was selected and the test pits with length width and depth of 8 m 2 3 m 2 3 m were excavated using small equipment fig 2 shows plan and profile views of the pit and pipe due to over excavation and soil disturbance at the bottom of the pit the undisturbed soil at the bottom was layered back and compacted to a depth of 0 36 m below the bottom of the pit before the pipeline was laid we selected three complete tube sections and two half sections to be connected through bell and spigot joints with rubber rings acting as seals to prevent seepage the effective length was 8 m after the pipe was in place the trench was backfilled with layers of loose soil each layer about 0 2 m thick the soil was then compacted by a small rammer plates about 10 mm thick were placed at both ends of the pipe to prevent soil from entering the pipe during the backfill compaction process a hole at an appropriate position was opened in each plate to allow for positioning of an i beam a dynatest 8000 fwd device was used in this test it could apply forces up to 100 kn through a load plate of area 0 0707 m2 the forces used in the test were 40 kn 60 kn 80 kn and 100 kn i e the corresponding loads were 566 kpa 849 kpa 1132 kpa and 1414 kpa acting directly on the soil above the pipe crown as shown in fig 2 the device fig 3 can lift and release a hammer by a computer controlled hydraulic system to apply a pulse load to the road surface the load is adjusted by changing the weight of the hammer and the height of the lift it acts on the roadway through a rigid disc load plate after each pulsed load the computer system automatically collects and records the force and loading time the measured waveform is approximated as a half sinusoid ji et al 2002 magnuson et al 1991 which shows that fwd simulates vehicle loads is feasible the vehicle parameters are as follows size of entire vehicle 6790 2110 2900 mm wheelbase 3800 mm wheel diameter 750 mm wheel width 180 mm single wheel contact area 0 018 m2 front axle single wheel rear axle double wheel fig 2b and c where the vehicle is not to scale and fig 4 the rated weight of the vehicle loaded in mass units is 7100 kg its actual weight in our tests was 6100 kg besides the axial load distribution ratio of the front and rear axles is 1 2 the calculation shows that the load generated by the rear wheel on one side is about 565 kpa which is roughly equivalent to the load of 566 kpa as mentioned earlier generated by the impact force of 40 kn as shown in fig 2b and c the void area was designed to be a longitudinal through hole below the pipeline about 1 4 ring area below the haunch with a cross section of 500 mm 150 mm 2 2 description of tests we carried out 26 tests applying both impact loads and driving loads the tests were divided into three groups the first group examined the dynamic response of the normal buried pipeline at different buried depths different load sizes and different load positions the second group all at a depth of 1 1 m applied different loads at different positions when the pipeline bottom was disengaged the third group of tests were carried out for the disengaged pipeline after polymer grouting repair with test conditions the same as for the second group table 1 provides details of the 26 tests 2 3 reinforced concrete pipe the test pipe was selected from the flexible joint c shaped steel bell rcpⅲ700 2000gb t 11836 2009 each pipe segment having a nominal inner diameter of 700 mm wall thickness of 70 mm and an effective length of 2000 mm the strength of the concrete used for pipe making was c30 and the standard value of its compressive strength was 30 mpa it was reinforced both circumferentially and longitudinally the circumferential reinforcing bars had a diameter of 3 0 mm and added up to 14 laps with a 133 mm spacing on centers the longitudinal cage had 6 steel rebars each 4 2 mm in diameter and spaced 400 mm on centers these were laid out to support the circumferential rebar the pipe met the requirements of a class ⅲ reinforced concrete pipe as specified in gb t 11836 2009 where more details are provided based on traditional theory of reinforced concrete the influence of longitudinal and circumferential rebar on the stiffness and strength of the pipe is negligible before concrete cracking this assumes that the rebar is not engaged until the concrete in tensile stress cracks lay and brachman 2014 during the tests the mechanical responses of the pipe to the loads are small as can be seen from the following experimental data far from reaching the ultimate strength of the material therefore the pipeline can be considered to be still in its elastic phase during the tests no ultimate damage occurred which was verified by observations made after the excavation at the end of the test 2 4 strain gauge and displacement sensor arrangement the structural response of the reinforced concrete pipes was obtained by monitoring electrical foil resistance strain gauges affixed to the outer surfaces of the pipe and displacement sensors placed on the inner wall of the crown uniaxial gauges of length 80 mm and 30 mm were used to reduce potential longitudinal variability resulting from concrete aggregate size the longer strain gauges were oriented longitudinally the shorter ones circumferentially as shown in fig 5 along the pipe s circumference angles of 0 360 45 135 90 180 225 315 and 270 measured counterclockwise from the east springline represent respectively the east springline the shoulder the crown the west springline the haunch and the bottom since the circumferential section of the pipe is symmetrical the strain gauges were affixed only on one side of the shoulder and the haunch specific details on the strain gauges and how they were attached to the pipe have been reported elsewhere by guan et al 2011 tensile strains or stresses are reported as positive values compressive strains or stresses as negative values to measure vertical displacement we used ywc 100 strain displacement sensors which have a measuring range of 100 mm an accuracy of not less than 0 3 mm and a resolution of 0 0125 mm the displacement sensors were arranged as shown in fig 6 at the section intermediate points p1 p2 and p3 and at the joints j1 j2 j3 and j4 the sensors p1 p2 and p3 were installed at a distance of 80 mm spigot part and 70 mm bell part from the joint they were uniformly placed on the inner wall of the pipe crown the slight settling of the i beam support structure can be neglected because the impact load of the test acts only on the soil above the pipeline and the equipment passage is cleared before each collection 2 5 soil and backfilling the reinforced concrete pipes were backfilled with well graded silty clay underlying the pipe sections was a 100 mm thick loose base this was augmented by a backfill approximately 150 300 mm thick to provide lift on both sides of the pipeline each backfill was compacted using a small rammer and the degree of compaction was tested by a dynamic cone penetrometer dcp all above 95 satisfying the requirements of the standard 50268 2008 2009 the maximum dry density ρ d max of the soil obtained by an indoor compaction test was 1 85 g cm3 and the optimum moisture content was 20 the variation of soil dry density ρ d with depth is plotted in fig 7 where it can be seen that the average density of each lift was relatively consistent not varying significantly with depth following current national standard of the ring cutter method of density testing in gb t 50123 1999 we found the average dry density of the soil as tested to be 1 8 g cm3 which is 97 of the maximum dry density and meets the requirements of compaction because the data instruments needed to be zeroed before each data collection it was impossible to measure the compaction process of the soil in response to the pipeline itself the results in this paper refer only to the incremental response caused by the additional load above the soil 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of soil cover depth to study the influence of the soil cover depth on pipe joint and body behavior tests 1 6 were carried out with soil cover depths of 0 9 m 1 0 m and 1 1 m using the same force of 100 kn see table 1 the results at the cross section of p2 mid middle of pipe 2 and j3 bell bell of joint 3 are listed in table 2 fig 8 a and b presents the circumferential or hoop stress of the cross section of p2 mid and j3 bell under different soil cover depths as shown in the figures the crown and bottom of both pipe body and bell experience compression while the springlines on both sides of the pipe are subjected to tension with the stress at the shoulder and the haunch being nearly zero similarly as shown in fig 9 a and b the sections exhibit similar stress characteristics the maximum circumferential stress of the pipe body due to an external load is measured at the crown where the peak compressive stress is 1 77 times larger than at the bottom and 2 26 times larger than the peak tensile stress measured at the outer springlines for impact forces 100 kn and with 1 1 m of soil cover because of the symmetry of the pipe s cross section the peak tensile stress on springlines of both sides are nearly the same however the maximum circumferential stress of the bell appears at the bottom its peak compressive stress at the outer bottom is 1 18 times larger than at the outer crown and 2 52 times larger than at the outer springlines for the same impact loads and for 1 0 m of soil cover it can be seen from fig 8 that as the soil cover depth increases the additional circumferential stress values at each test point of the pipe decreases especially at the pipe crown see fig 8a and table 2 the peak stress values at a soil cover depths of 1 0 m and 1 1 m are respectively 0 74 and 0 73 times the values at 0 9 m soil cover depth evidently the stress at a cover depth of 1 1 m is close to that at a depth of 1 0 m see table 2 indicating that beyond a cover depth of 1 0 m the pipe circumferential stress caused by additional load shows little additional change based on ref rakitin and xu 2016 compared with the response of the pipe due to the earth pressure the additional load plays very little role beyond a soil cover depth of about 1 m 3 2 influence of different impact load in order to study the influence of different loads on the mechanical response of the pipe joint and body tests 7 12 were all carried out with a soil cover depth of 1 1 m the results can be compared with those of tests 5 and 6 in which the force is 100 kn see tables 2 and 3 figs 8a and 9a present the peak circumferential stress of the cross section of p2 mid under different loads in tests 5 7 9 and 11 the p2 mid section also has maximum compressive stress at the crown and the stress around the pipe increases as the loads increase especially at the crown the peak compressive stress at forces of 60 kn 80 kn and 100 kn are respectively 1 81 2 28 and 2 68 times larger than it at 40 kn see tables 2 and 3 the j3 bell section also shows maximum compressive stress at the bottom and the corresponding stress values are respectively 1 69 1 92 and 2 2 times larger than it at 40 kn figs 8b and 9b and tables 2 and 3 in short in keeping with expectation the greater the additional load the more unfavorable the response of the pipeline in summary the impact load is transmitted to the pipeline through the cover soil which brings compression at the crown and bottom and tension at the springlines on the outer surface of the wall because of the pipe soil interaction and the peak circumferential stress at the bell is much larger than in the pipe body therefore the crown and bottom of the pipe and the section of the bell will be principal research objects in future studies 3 3 influence of polymer grouting repair in order to evaluate the effect of polymer grouting technology on repairing a disengaged pipeline tests 17 18 23 and 24 were carried out to analyze the mechanical response of the pipeline with grouting repair by comparing the results with those of tests 5 and 6 in all of which tests the soil cover depth was 1 1 m and the impact force was 100 kn the circumferential stress path longitudinal stress path and vertical displacement of the inner crown of the pipeline are plotted in figs 10 14 and the test results are listed in table 4 fig 10a and b presents the peak circumferential stress of the p2 mid section and j3 bell section during the normal disengaged and polymer repaired pipeline conditions as can be seen from the figures and from the data in table 4 the stress state and values around the pipeline under normal and polymer repaired conditions are consistent and the stress values after repair are even smaller than normal specifically the largest stress difference between the two conditions appears at the bottom of p2 mid section where the difference is 0 062 mpa see table 4 followed by the springlines and with the minimum difference at the crown however the j3 bell section has the largest difference 0 103 mpa at the crown evidently the pipeline can return to a normal stress state after being polymer repaired however when there was a void in the soil below the haunch the peak circumferential stress state did change greatly fig 10 although the stress tendencies at the crown and the springlines are comparable to those at the other two conditions the stress value for the disengaged condition is much smaller than for the other two moreover the stress states at the haunch and at the bottom of the pipeline change significantly the compressive stress at the bottom is much reduced it is close to zero in fig 10a nevertheless the compressive stress at the haunch increased by 9 22 times figs 10a and 5 66 times fig 10b respectively compared with the normal condition it is clear that the disengaged condition has a great influence on the overall response of the pipeline during the tests a void area was created by hollowing out the soil at about 1 4 of the ring below the haunch along the pipeline fig 2 which caused the pipe to lose the support of the soil below when an impact load is applied the condition that the pipeline is restrained by the normal covering soil has changed due to the loss of the supporting force of the soil at bottom so that the overall stress of the entire pipeline section is reduced especially at the bottom of the pipe body the compressive stress is almost zero affected by the circular cross section of the pipe the soil near the haunch of the pipeline is subjected to most of the supporting action so a large stress concentration occurs at the haunch and the compressive stress at this place naturally becomes large figs 11 14 show the longitudinal stress at the outer crown and the vertical displacement at the inner crown of the pipeline in tests 5 6 17 18 23 and 24 based on these results it can be seen that the longitudinal stress and the vertical displacement of the pipeline are basically symmetrical with respect to the load position under three different conditions but this symmetry is broken at the pipe joint showing a large discontinuity because of the presence of the bell and spigot at each joint the pipeline is not completely symmetrical along the longitudinal axis so the stress and displacement at the pipe joint are not identical it is obvious that the maximum longitudinal stresses all appear at the joints z 1 3 5 and 7 m while the maximum displacement occurs at the load position it can therefore be concluded that the pipeline joints and the load location are the most hazardous positions for the pipeline and deserves more attention the impact load has its greatest influence within 3 m on both sides of its point of action its influence beyond this range is small as shown in figs 11 and 13 the longitudinal stress at the crown of the disengaged pipeline is generally smaller for the other two conditions which is consistent with the circumferential stress trend analyzed previously see fig 10 as can be seen disengagement has a great influence on the longitudinal and circumferential stress of the pipeline however when the impact load is at 4 m fig 11 the longitudinal stresses at j2 and j3 are the largest with disengagement the maximum difference from normal being 0 068 mpa while that of j1 and j4 are between the other two conditions the same as j3 when the load is at 5 m see fig 13 this may be related to unknown disturbances and instrument acquisition errors in the test processes since the void area runs through the bottom of the pipeline the vertical displacement of the disengaged pipeline is greater than for the other two conditions the maximum difference from normal being 0 012 mm see table 4 this occurs when the load is at 4 m and as one might expect the farther away from the load position the smaller the difference i e the smaller the impact when the load is at 5 m the value of the stress and displacement are maximum at j3 where the stress increases by 0 387 mpa and the displacement increases by 0 03 mm table 4 compared with the load acting at 4 m furthermore there is a large discontinuity in the displacement of the bell and spigot at j2 and j3 where the maximum displacement difference reaches about 0 01 mm see fig 12 evidently the mechanical properties of the pipeline are most strongly affected when the load acts on a joint in addition the longitudinal stress and vertical displacement of the polymer repaired pipeline are very close to although slightly smaller than those of the normal pipeline further evidence that polymer grouting can restore a pipeline to near normal 3 4 influence of driving load and driving conditions in order to understand the dynamic response of the pipeline under impact load the hoop and longitudinal strain time history curves of the crown of p2 mid and the bottom of the j3 bell are extracted and plotted in figs 15 and 16 the figures show that the strain of the pipe reaches a peak at a certain moment under the impact load and then the peak gradually attenuates to a small value thereafter since the pipeline is buried underground the fluctuation response of the pipeline is gradually attenuated until it disappears after the load impact ends being affected by the damping of the soil and by its own damping in addition the hoop strain at both p2 and j3 is larger than the longitudinal strain about 6 times larger therefore the circumferential direction is a more unfavorable direction of force on the pipeline than the longitudinal direction also the strain at the disengaged pipeline is smaller than for the other two conditions which is consistent with the stress state clearly the strain time history of the polymer repaired condition is basically consistent with that of the normal condition showing that the deformation state of the pipeline after grouting repair can return to its normal level for a moving vehicle the relationship between the earth pressure duration t and the vehicle speed v is given by hyodo and yasuhara 1990 fig 17 the data can be fitted with the following equation t 1 5514 ln v 6 2656 according to the above formula when the driving speed is 10 km h the additional soil pressure duration is about 2 7 s to simulate real vehicle loads we carried out tests 13 19 and 25 as suggested by fig 2 one side of the vehicle s wheels exerted a downward force on the soil surface above the test pipeline as it moved at a constant speed of 10 km h along the longitudinal direction of the pipeline at the same time tests 14 20 and 26 were conducted to study the influence of uneven road surface on the response of the underground buried pipeline during the tests an obstacle was placed on the soil surface above joint j3 fig 4 to simulate the vehicle encountering an uneven road surface the hoop strain time history curves of the crown at p2 mid and the bottom at j3 bell under three conditions are shown in figs 18 and 19 as can be seen from the figures under the driving load the strain time history curves of the pipeline do not have an oscillation attenuation like that of an impact load but instead are similar in shape to the root of a tooth gradually diminishing after the occurrence of two peaks the two peaks are not the same size the later one being greater than the earlier one because the lighter front axle of the vehicle passes over the sensors first ahead of the heavier rear axle the duration is about 3 s which is slightly larger than that of the additional soil pressure 2 7 s which is due to the existence of the pipe soil interaction similarly in the condition after disengagement the strain of the pipeline is still less than for the other two conditions and the curve trend and the peak size are consistent between the polymer repaired and the normal that means that polymer grouting can be used to restore disengaged pipeline to a normal standard table 5 lists the maximum circumferential strain at the crown of p2 mid and the bottom of j3 bell for tests 11 16 19 22 and 25 26 the comparison shows that under the same additional load about 565 kpa the strain generated by an impact load is greater than that of a driving load in the three conditions i e the normal polymer repaired and disengaged conditions and the former is about 2 3 times the latter when the vehicle passes obstacles the strain generated at the crown of p2 is greater than for normal driving especially for disengaged pipe the maximum multiple being about 1 8 moreover at the obstacle setting i e at j3 this difference also reaches a maximum about 1 86 times larger than normal in the disengaged condition and comes second about 1 33 times larger than normal in the polymer repaired condition but the difference is small for normal condition consequently the polymer grouting technology has a certain positive effect in repairing the disengaged pipeline and even can restore the mechanical properties of the normal pipeline when the vehicle is traveling on an uneven road surface any void at the bottom will cause an increase in the dynamic response of the pipeline in conclusion the unevenness of the road surface especially because of potholes or bumps is potentially hazardous for an underground buried pipeline therefore the smoothness of an urban road surface not only affects comfort but also affects the service life of the underground pipeline for the study of buried pipeline if the traffic load is simplified to that of an impact load the result will be too large and the authenticity will be lost thus a certain reduction factor should be considered based on the above results other load models will be explored in future research to bring them closer to real world situations 4 conclusions in this paper we report on tests of a 700 mm inner diameter reinforced concrete drain pipeline under impact load and driving load longitudinal strains circumferential strains and vertical displacements of the normal pipeline disengaged pipeline and polymer repaired pipeline were collected and analyzed we also studied the mechanical responses of the pipeline under different soil cover depths load sizes load locations and load types our conclusions are as follows 1 the buried pipeline experiences compression at the outer crown and bottom and tension at the springlines under a dynamic load at the surface at the same time the shoulder and the haunch of the pipeline are the least stressed close to zero for the concrete pipe body the tensile stress at the springlines is 44 of the compressive stress at the crown more than normal the tensile strength of concrete is generally 1 10 to 1 20 of the compressive strength this means that the hoop tensile stress at the springlines on both sides of the concrete pipe is the main factor determining whether the pipe is damaged in addition the circumferential strain of the pipeline is much larger than the longitudinal strain making the circumferential direction most hazardous 2 as the soil cover depth increases the additional circumferential stress decreases indicating as one might expect that the response of the pipeline to additional surface load decreases as the soil cover depths increases for greater soil cover depths pipeline force caused by earth pressure should receive more attention 3 the additional circumferential stress of the pipeline increases as the load on the ground increases not surprisingly the greater the load the more unfavorable the stress on the pipeline this suggests that urban road traffic load should be subjected to some control especially for roads with underground pipeline limiting the weight of vehicles would extend the service life of the pipeline 4 a load has its greatest influence on a pipeline within 3 m on both sides of its point of action beyond that range its influence is small other features of interest the longitudinal stress on a pipeline has a large abrupt change at the joints at z 1 3 5 and 7 m in our tests and the hoop stress at the joints is larger than in the pipe body the vertical displacement of a stressed pipeline reaches a maximum at the location of the load the displacements of the bells and spigots at the joints are discontinuous and are not the same the maximum difference is about 0 01 mm this kind of deviation is the main cause of the staggered joint and leaking of the pipeline which causes the pipeline to disengage the road surface to collapse and even the entire pipeline to come apart 5 joints are the most vulnerable points of an entire pipeline and deserve more attention 6 the strain time history curves of a pipeline under impact load and under driving load both reach a peak at a certain moment and then diminish but the curves of the two are very different an impact load may be used to simulate a real traffic load although it produces a dynamic response more than twice that of actual traffic the unevenness of a road surface especially potholes and bumps will also increase the dynamic response of an underground buried pipeline to the ground traffic load thus affecting the service life of the underground pipeline 7 disengaging at the bottom of a pipeline has a large influence on the overall mechanical properties of the pipeline the stress state has a large adverse change and the vertical displacement also increases to varying degrees as our tests confirm polymer grouting technology can treat and repair disengaged pipelines with excellent results we found the strains and displacements of a repaired pipeline subjected to stresses to be close to those of a normal pipeline our reported results are only applicable to the specific soil pipe properties pipe laying techniques and load conditions tested despite the limited scope of the testing and many unknown factors at the site we were able to complete tests under relatively controlled conditions and to draw some useful conclusions our tests also provided an opportunity for validation of existing design methods and finite element analyses for these specific conditions against a known dataset on the basis of these results we plan more elaborate

22833,polymer grouting technology is a cost effective and trenchless method for repairing leakage and subsidence of drainage pipelines this paper reports the results of a full scale experimental approach in the field where we tested the structural dynamic responses before and after polymer grouting trenchless repairing of a reinforced concrete drainage pipeline of 700 mm inner diameter buried in dense soil and subjected to both surface impact loads and driving loads the dynamic changes of three types of pipeline the normal pipeline disengaged pipeline and polymer repaired pipeline is reported in detail in this paper for different soil cover depths types and magnitudes of loads and locations the results show that under the surface load of the soil the pipe experiences compression at its crown and bottom and tension at its springlines on both sides moreover the circumferential stress is greater than its longitudinal stress an additional impact load or driving load has its greatest influence within 3 m on both sides of its point of action the bell and spigot joints are the most vulnerable places in the pipeline there the vertical displacement is discontinuous and relatively large when extra loads are applied the dynamic response of the pipeline is greater to impact loads than to actual driving loads of comparable magnitude uneven pavement also enhances the response of a buried pipeline to the surface traffic load pipeline disengagement has a substantial negative effect on the overall mechanical resilience of the pipeline however polymer grouting can repair a disengaged pipeline effectively even restoring its mechanical behavior to that of a normal pipeline keywords pipeline damage pipeline repair drainage pipeline polymer grouting trenchless rehabilitation 1 introduction reinforced concrete pipes are currently the most widely used in municipal drainage applications as of 2015 the total length of drainage pipes in large and medium sized cities in china exceeded 500 000 km fang et al 2018 accidents in these pipes such as leakage subsidence disengagement and fractures are not uncommon and can lead to undesirable consequences such as pavement collapse traffic congestion damage to above ground structures and groundwater contamination all of which adversely affect people s lives and productivity xu et al 2017 researchers in china and other countries have carried out many studies of the mechanical properties of pipelines for example liu 2007 established an analytical model and calculational method for the interaction between buried pipelines and soil and obtained a series of encouraging theoretical solutions all however based on the study of static force and deformation arzaghi et al 2018 using a dynamic bayesian network dbn methodology proposed a novel probabilistic methodology for integrated modelling of pitting and corrosion fatigue degradation processes of subsea pipelines a closed circuit television system cctv used by buco et al 2006 to test an 1800 km sewer pipe network revealed that 27 of the defects in the concrete pipe were related to displacement or opening of joints failure of a joint leads to leakage from the pipe and erosion of the supporting soil causing subsidence of the pipeline which in turn gives rise to pavement collapse sheldon et al 2015 carried out field performance tests of existing pipelines under different load conditions and studied the displacement of the pipeline joints under both static and dynamic loads traffic loads tend to have the greatest impact on buried pipeline mccann et al 2018 conducted an experiments to investigate the influence of the thickness of polymer field joint coatings on the behavior of pipeline joints when being bent during reeling operations hyodo and yasuhara 1990 measured the additional vertical stress generated over time by vehicle loads at different depths which can be modeled as a half wave sinusoid most of the reported studies analyze the stress characteristics of buried pipeline and investigate damage tests but few examine the repair of disengaged pipeline traditional repair methods cannot lift a subsided pipe section or reinforce a weak foundation and so leave the possibility of secondary subsidence which can cause a pipeline joint to be dislocated again resulting in leakage sandblasting and other damage fang et al 2018 wang et al 2015a polymer grouting technology is a rapid repair and reinforcement technology for pipelines it makes use of a self expanding anhydrous reactive polymer material and can be injected as a two component polymer material outside the pipe wall it expands and solidifies rapidly after its reaction as shown in fig 1 it can reinforce a foundation and or lift a disengaged pipe its advantages include the following guo and wang 2012 naudts 2003 shi et al 2010 wang et al 2015a 2015b xu et al 2012 the technology has already been successfully applied to the reinforcement and repair of underground structures such as roads tunnels dams and some pipelines based on three dimensional numerical simulation fang et al 2018 explored the mechanical properties of drainage pipelines before and after polymer grouting xu et al 2017 used abaqus finite element simulation to analyze the static and seismic loading effects on a subsidence pipeline before and after polymer grouting repair wang et al 2018 analyzed the dynamic response of pipelines under traffic loads based on the finite element method fem odina et al 2018 built a fem to evaluate the structural response of a cra lined pipeline that subjected to external impact loads the results of the above numerical model analyses still lack the verification of field test data based on previous studies and considering the conditions of normal disengaged and polymer repaired reinforced concrete drainage pipes with flexible joints this paper reports a full scale test in a relatively controlled environment and explores the mechanical properties of pipelines at different soil cover depths load sizes locations and types of driving conditions under both impact load and driving load the results should provide helpful data for future numerical analyses 2 full scale experiment details 2 1 test configuration the tests were carried out in a relatively open outdoor area surrounded by residential areas with no large scale mechanical construction operations in the vicinity so that the tests were largely free of outside interference relatively flat ground was selected and the test pits with length width and depth of 8 m 2 3 m 2 3 m were excavated using small equipment fig 2 shows plan and profile views of the pit and pipe due to over excavation and soil disturbance at the bottom of the pit the undisturbed soil at the bottom was layered back and compacted to a depth of 0 36 m below the bottom of the pit before the pipeline was laid we selected three complete tube sections and two half sections to be connected through bell and spigot joints with rubber rings acting as seals to prevent seepage the effective length was 8 m after the pipe was in place the trench was backfilled with layers of loose soil each layer about 0 2 m thick the soil was then compacted by a small rammer plates about 10 mm thick were placed at both ends of the pipe to prevent soil from entering the pipe during the backfill compaction process a hole at an appropriate position was opened in each plate to allow for positioning of an i beam a dynatest 8000 fwd device was used in this test it could apply forces up to 100 kn through a load plate of area 0 0707 m2 the forces used in the test were 40 kn 60 kn 80 kn and 100 kn i e the corresponding loads were 566 kpa 849 kpa 1132 kpa and 1414 kpa acting directly on the soil above the pipe crown as shown in fig 2 the device fig 3 can lift and release a hammer by a computer controlled hydraulic system to apply a pulse load to the road surface the load is adjusted by changing the weight of the hammer and the height of the lift it acts on the roadway through a rigid disc load plate after each pulsed load the computer system automatically collects and records the force and loading time the measured waveform is approximated as a half sinusoid ji et al 2002 magnuson et al 1991 which shows that fwd simulates vehicle loads is feasible the vehicle parameters are as follows size of entire vehicle 6790 2110 2900 mm wheelbase 3800 mm wheel diameter 750 mm wheel width 180 mm single wheel contact area 0 018 m2 front axle single wheel rear axle double wheel fig 2b and c where the vehicle is not to scale and fig 4 the rated weight of the vehicle loaded in mass units is 7100 kg its actual weight in our tests was 6100 kg besides the axial load distribution ratio of the front and rear axles is 1 2 the calculation shows that the load generated by the rear wheel on one side is about 565 kpa which is roughly equivalent to the load of 566 kpa as mentioned earlier generated by the impact force of 40 kn as shown in fig 2b and c the void area was designed to be a longitudinal through hole below the pipeline about 1 4 ring area below the haunch with a cross section of 500 mm 150 mm 2 2 description of tests we carried out 26 tests applying both impact loads and driving loads the tests were divided into three groups the first group examined the dynamic response of the normal buried pipeline at different buried depths different load sizes and different load positions the second group all at a depth of 1 1 m applied different loads at different positions when the pipeline bottom was disengaged the third group of tests were carried out for the disengaged pipeline after polymer grouting repair with test conditions the same as for the second group table 1 provides details of the 26 tests 2 3 reinforced concrete pipe the test pipe was selected from the flexible joint c shaped steel bell rcpⅲ700 2000gb t 11836 2009 each pipe segment having a nominal inner diameter of 700 mm wall thickness of 70 mm and an effective length of 2000 mm the strength of the concrete used for pipe making was c30 and the standard value of its compressive strength was 30 mpa it was reinforced both circumferentially and longitudinally the circumferential reinforcing bars had a diameter of 3 0 mm and added up to 14 laps with a 133 mm spacing on centers the longitudinal cage had 6 steel rebars each 4 2 mm in diameter and spaced 400 mm on centers these were laid out to support the circumferential rebar the pipe met the requirements of a class ⅲ reinforced concrete pipe as specified in gb t 11836 2009 where more details are provided based on traditional theory of reinforced concrete the influence of longitudinal and circumferential rebar on the stiffness and strength of the pipe is negligible before concrete cracking this assumes that the rebar is not engaged until the concrete in tensile stress cracks lay and brachman 2014 during the tests the mechanical responses of the pipe to the loads are small as can be seen from the following experimental data far from reaching the ultimate strength of the material therefore the pipeline can be considered to be still in its elastic phase during the tests no ultimate damage occurred which was verified by observations made after the excavation at the end of the test 2 4 strain gauge and displacement sensor arrangement the structural response of the reinforced concrete pipes was obtained by monitoring electrical foil resistance strain gauges affixed to the outer surfaces of the pipe and displacement sensors placed on the inner wall of the crown uniaxial gauges of length 80 mm and 30 mm were used to reduce potential longitudinal variability resulting from concrete aggregate size the longer strain gauges were oriented longitudinally the shorter ones circumferentially as shown in fig 5 along the pipe s circumference angles of 0 360 45 135 90 180 225 315 and 270 measured counterclockwise from the east springline represent respectively the east springline the shoulder the crown the west springline the haunch and the bottom since the circumferential section of the pipe is symmetrical the strain gauges were affixed only on one side of the shoulder and the haunch specific details on the strain gauges and how they were attached to the pipe have been reported elsewhere by guan et al 2011 tensile strains or stresses are reported as positive values compressive strains or stresses as negative values to measure vertical displacement we used ywc 100 strain displacement sensors which have a measuring range of 100 mm an accuracy of not less than 0 3 mm and a resolution of 0 0125 mm the displacement sensors were arranged as shown in fig 6 at the section intermediate points p1 p2 and p3 and at the joints j1 j2 j3 and j4 the sensors p1 p2 and p3 were installed at a distance of 80 mm spigot part and 70 mm bell part from the joint they were uniformly placed on the inner wall of the pipe crown the slight settling of the i beam support structure can be neglected because the impact load of the test acts only on the soil above the pipeline and the equipment passage is cleared before each collection 2 5 soil and backfilling the reinforced concrete pipes were backfilled with well graded silty clay underlying the pipe sections was a 100 mm thick loose base this was augmented by a backfill approximately 150 300 mm thick to provide lift on both sides of the pipeline each backfill was compacted using a small rammer and the degree of compaction was tested by a dynamic cone penetrometer dcp all above 95 satisfying the requirements of the standard 50268 2008 2009 the maximum dry density ρ d max of the soil obtained by an indoor compaction test was 1 85 g cm3 and the optimum moisture content was 20 the variation of soil dry density ρ d with depth is plotted in fig 7 where it can be seen that the average density of each lift was relatively consistent not varying significantly with depth following current national standard of the ring cutter method of density testing in gb t 50123 1999 we found the average dry density of the soil as tested to be 1 8 g cm3 which is 97 of the maximum dry density and meets the requirements of compaction because the data instruments needed to be zeroed before each data collection it was impossible to measure the compaction process of the soil in response to the pipeline itself the results in this paper refer only to the incremental response caused by the additional load above the soil 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of soil cover depth to study the influence of the soil cover depth on pipe joint and body behavior tests 1 6 were carried out with soil cover depths of 0 9 m 1 0 m and 1 1 m using the same force of 100 kn see table 1 the results at the cross section of p2 mid middle of pipe 2 and j3 bell bell of joint 3 are listed in table 2 fig 8 a and b presents the circumferential or hoop stress of the cross section of p2 mid and j3 bell under different soil cover depths as shown in the figures the crown and bottom of both pipe body and bell experience compression while the springlines on both sides of the pipe are subjected to tension with the stress at the shoulder and the haunch being nearly zero similarly as shown in fig 9 a and b the sections exhibit similar stress characteristics the maximum circumferential stress of the pipe body due to an external load is measured at the crown where the peak compressive stress is 1 77 times larger than at the bottom and 2 26 times larger than the peak tensile stress measured at the outer springlines for impact forces 100 kn and with 1 1 m of soil cover because of the symmetry of the pipe s cross section the peak tensile stress on springlines of both sides are nearly the same however the maximum circumferential stress of the bell appears at the bottom its peak compressive stress at the outer bottom is 1 18 times larger than at the outer crown and 2 52 times larger than at the outer springlines for the same impact loads and for 1 0 m of soil cover it can be seen from fig 8 that as the soil cover depth increases the additional circumferential stress values at each test point of the pipe decreases especially at the pipe crown see fig 8a and table 2 the peak stress values at a soil cover depths of 1 0 m and 1 1 m are respectively 0 74 and 0 73 times the values at 0 9 m soil cover depth evidently the stress at a cover depth of 1 1 m is close to that at a depth of 1 0 m see table 2 indicating that beyond a cover depth of 1 0 m the pipe circumferential stress caused by additional load shows little additional change based on ref rakitin and xu 2016 compared with the response of the pipe due to the earth pressure the additional load plays very little role beyond a soil cover depth of about 1 m 3 2 influence of different impact load in order to study the influence of different loads on the mechanical response of the pipe joint and body tests 7 12 were all carried out with a soil cover depth of 1 1 m the results can be compared with those of tests 5 and 6 in which the force is 100 kn see tables 2 and 3 figs 8a and 9a present the peak circumferential stress of the cross section of p2 mid under different loads in tests 5 7 9 and 11 the p2 mid section also has maximum compressive stress at the crown and the stress around the pipe increases as the loads increase especially at the crown the peak compressive stress at forces of 60 kn 80 kn and 100 kn are respectively 1 81 2 28 and 2 68 times larger than it at 40 kn see tables 2 and 3 the j3 bell section also shows maximum compressive stress at the bottom and the corresponding stress values are respectively 1 69 1 92 and 2 2 times larger than it at 40 kn figs 8b and 9b and tables 2 and 3 in short in keeping with expectation the greater the additional load the more unfavorable the response of the pipeline in summary the impact load is transmitted to the pipeline through the cover soil which brings compression at the crown and bottom and tension at the springlines on the outer surface of the wall because of the pipe soil interaction and the peak circumferential stress at the bell is much larger than in the pipe body therefore the crown and bottom of the pipe and the section of the bell will be principal research objects in future studies 3 3 influence of polymer grouting repair in order to evaluate the effect of polymer grouting technology on repairing a disengaged pipeline tests 17 18 23 and 24 were carried out to analyze the mechanical response of the pipeline with grouting repair by comparing the results with those of tests 5 and 6 in all of which tests the soil cover depth was 1 1 m and the impact force was 100 kn the circumferential stress path longitudinal stress path and vertical displacement of the inner crown of the pipeline are plotted in figs 10 14 and the test results are listed in table 4 fig 10a and b presents the peak circumferential stress of the p2 mid section and j3 bell section during the normal disengaged and polymer repaired pipeline conditions as can be seen from the figures and from the data in table 4 the stress state and values around the pipeline under normal and polymer repaired conditions are consistent and the stress values after repair are even smaller than normal specifically the largest stress difference between the two conditions appears at the bottom of p2 mid section where the difference is 0 062 mpa see table 4 followed by the springlines and with the minimum difference at the crown however the j3 bell section has the largest difference 0 103 mpa at the crown evidently the pipeline can return to a normal stress state after being polymer repaired however when there was a void in the soil below the haunch the peak circumferential stress state did change greatly fig 10 although the stress tendencies at the crown and the springlines are comparable to those at the other two conditions the stress value for the disengaged condition is much smaller than for the other two moreover the stress states at the haunch and at the bottom of the pipeline change significantly the compressive stress at the bottom is much reduced it is close to zero in fig 10a nevertheless the compressive stress at the haunch increased by 9 22 times figs 10a and 5 66 times fig 10b respectively compared with the normal condition it is clear that the disengaged condition has a great influence on the overall response of the pipeline during the tests a void area was created by hollowing out the soil at about 1 4 of the ring below the haunch along the pipeline fig 2 which caused the pipe to lose the support of the soil below when an impact load is applied the condition that the pipeline is restrained by the normal covering soil has changed due to the loss of the supporting force of the soil at bottom so that the overall stress of the entire pipeline section is reduced especially at the bottom of the pipe body the compressive stress is almost zero affected by the circular cross section of the pipe the soil near the haunch of the pipeline is subjected to most of the supporting action so a large stress concentration occurs at the haunch and the compressive stress at this place naturally becomes large figs 11 14 show the longitudinal stress at the outer crown and the vertical displacement at the inner crown of the pipeline in tests 5 6 17 18 23 and 24 based on these results it can be seen that the longitudinal stress and the vertical displacement of the pipeline are basically symmetrical with respect to the load position under three different conditions but this symmetry is broken at the pipe joint showing a large discontinuity because of the presence of the bell and spigot at each joint the pipeline is not completely symmetrical along the longitudinal axis so the stress and displacement at the pipe joint are not identical it is obvious that the maximum longitudinal stresses all appear at the joints z 1 3 5 and 7 m while the maximum displacement occurs at the load position it can therefore be concluded that the pipeline joints and the load location are the most hazardous positions for the pipeline and deserves more attention the impact load has its greatest influence within 3 m on both sides of its point of action its influence beyond this range is small as shown in figs 11 and 13 the longitudinal stress at the crown of the disengaged pipeline is generally smaller for the other two conditions which is consistent with the circumferential stress trend analyzed previously see fig 10 as can be seen disengagement has a great influence on the longitudinal and circumferential stress of the pipeline however when the impact load is at 4 m fig 11 the longitudinal stresses at j2 and j3 are the largest with disengagement the maximum difference from normal being 0 068 mpa while that of j1 and j4 are between the other two conditions the same as j3 when the load is at 5 m see fig 13 this may be related to unknown disturbances and instrument acquisition errors in the test processes since the void area runs through the bottom of the pipeline the vertical displacement of the disengaged pipeline is greater than for the other two conditions the maximum difference from normal being 0 012 mm see table 4 this occurs when the load is at 4 m and as one might expect the farther away from the load position the smaller the difference i e the smaller the impact when the load is at 5 m the value of the stress and displacement are maximum at j3 where the stress increases by 0 387 mpa and the displacement increases by 0 03 mm table 4 compared with the load acting at 4 m furthermore there is a large discontinuity in the displacement of the bell and spigot at j2 and j3 where the maximum displacement difference reaches about 0 01 mm see fig 12 evidently the mechanical properties of the pipeline are most strongly affected when the load acts on a joint in addition the longitudinal stress and vertical displacement of the polymer repaired pipeline are very close to although slightly smaller than those of the normal pipeline further evidence that polymer grouting can restore a pipeline to near normal 3 4 influence of driving load and driving conditions in order to understand the dynamic response of the pipeline under impact load the hoop and longitudinal strain time history curves of the crown of p2 mid and the bottom of the j3 bell are extracted and plotted in figs 15 and 16 the figures show that the strain of the pipe reaches a peak at a certain moment under the impact load and then the peak gradually attenuates to a small value thereafter since the pipeline is buried underground the fluctuation response of the pipeline is gradually attenuated until it disappears after the load impact ends being affected by the damping of the soil and by its own damping in addition the hoop strain at both p2 and j3 is larger than the longitudinal strain about 6 times larger therefore the circumferential direction is a more unfavorable direction of force on the pipeline than the longitudinal direction also the strain at the disengaged pipeline is smaller than for the other two conditions which is consistent with the stress state clearly the strain time history of the polymer repaired condition is basically consistent with that of the normal condition showing that the deformation state of the pipeline after grouting repair can return to its normal level for a moving vehicle the relationship between the earth pressure duration t and the vehicle speed v is given by hyodo and yasuhara 1990 fig 17 the data can be fitted with the following equation t 1 5514 ln v 6 2656 according to the above formula when the driving speed is 10 km h the additional soil pressure duration is about 2 7 s to simulate real vehicle loads we carried out tests 13 19 and 25 as suggested by fig 2 one side of the vehicle s wheels exerted a downward force on the soil surface above the test pipeline as it moved at a constant speed of 10 km h along the longitudinal direction of the pipeline at the same time tests 14 20 and 26 were conducted to study the influence of uneven road surface on the response of the underground buried pipeline during the tests an obstacle was placed on the soil surface above joint j3 fig 4 to simulate the vehicle encountering an uneven road surface the hoop strain time history curves of the crown at p2 mid and the bottom at j3 bell under three conditions are shown in figs 18 and 19 as can be seen from the figures under the driving load the strain time history curves of the pipeline do not have an oscillation attenuation like that of an impact load but instead are similar in shape to the root of a tooth gradually diminishing after the occurrence of two peaks the two peaks are not the same size the later one being greater than the earlier one because the lighter front axle of the vehicle passes over the sensors first ahead of the heavier rear axle the duration is about 3 s which is slightly larger than that of the additional soil pressure 2 7 s which is due to the existence of the pipe soil interaction similarly in the condition after disengagement the strain of the pipeline is still less than for the other two conditions and the curve trend and the peak size are consistent between the polymer repaired and the normal that means that polymer grouting can be used to restore disengaged pipeline to a normal standard table 5 lists the maximum circumferential strain at the crown of p2 mid and the bottom of j3 bell for tests 11 16 19 22 and 25 26 the comparison shows that under the same additional load about 565 kpa the strain generated by an impact load is greater than that of a driving load in the three conditions i e the normal polymer repaired and disengaged conditions and the former is about 2 3 times the latter when the vehicle passes obstacles the strain generated at the crown of p2 is greater than for normal driving especially for disengaged pipe the maximum multiple being about 1 8 moreover at the obstacle setting i e at j3 this difference also reaches a maximum about 1 86 times larger than normal in the disengaged condition and comes second about 1 33 times larger than normal in the polymer repaired condition but the difference is small for normal condition consequently the polymer grouting technology has a certain positive effect in repairing the disengaged pipeline and even can restore the mechanical properties of the normal pipeline when the vehicle is traveling on an uneven road surface any void at the bottom will cause an increase in the dynamic response of the pipeline in conclusion the unevenness of the road surface especially because of potholes or bumps is potentially hazardous for an underground buried pipeline therefore the smoothness of an urban road surface not only affects comfort but also affects the service life of the underground pipeline for the study of buried pipeline if the traffic load is simplified to that of an impact load the result will be too large and the authenticity will be lost thus a certain reduction factor should be considered based on the above results other load models will be explored in future research to bring them closer to real world situations 4 conclusions in this paper we report on tests of a 700 mm inner diameter reinforced concrete drain pipeline under impact load and driving load longitudinal strains circumferential strains and vertical displacements of the normal pipeline disengaged pipeline and polymer repaired pipeline were collected and analyzed we also studied the mechanical responses of the pipeline under different soil cover depths load sizes load locations and load types our conclusions are as follows 1 the buried pipeline experiences compression at the outer crown and bottom and tension at the springlines under a dynamic load at the surface at the same time the shoulder and the haunch of the pipeline are the least stressed close to zero for the concrete pipe body the tensile stress at the springlines is 44 of the compressive stress at the crown more than normal the tensile strength of concrete is generally 1 10 to 1 20 of the compressive strength this means that the hoop tensile stress at the springlines on both sides of the concrete pipe is the main factor determining whether the pipe is damaged in addition the circumferential strain of the pipeline is much larger than the longitudinal strain making the circumferential direction most hazardous 2 as the soil cover depth increases the additional circumferential stress decreases indicating as one might expect that the response of the pipeline to additional surface load decreases as the soil cover depths increases for greater soil cover depths pipeline force caused by earth pressure should receive more attention 3 the additional circumferential stress of the pipeline increases as the load on the ground increases not surprisingly the greater the load the more unfavorable the stress on the pipeline this suggests that urban road traffic load should be subjected to some control especially for roads with underground pipeline limiting the weight of vehicles would extend the service life of the pipeline 4 a load has its greatest influence on a pipeline within 3 m on both sides of its point of action beyond that range its influence is small other features of interest the longitudinal stress on a pipeline has a large abrupt change at the joints at z 1 3 5 and 7 m in our tests and the hoop stress at the joints is larger than in the pipe body the vertical displacement of a stressed pipeline reaches a maximum at the location of the load the displacements of the bells and spigots at the joints are discontinuous and are not the same the maximum difference is about 0 01 mm this kind of deviation is the main cause of the staggered joint and leaking of the pipeline which causes the pipeline to disengage the road surface to collapse and even the entire pipeline to come apart 5 joints are the most vulnerable points of an entire pipeline and deserve more attention 6 the strain time history curves of a pipeline under impact load and under driving load both reach a peak at a certain moment and then diminish but the curves of the two are very different an impact load may be used to simulate a real traffic load although it produces a dynamic response more than twice that of actual traffic the unevenness of a road surface especially potholes and bumps will also increase the dynamic response of an underground buried pipeline to the ground traffic load thus affecting the service life of the underground pipeline 7 disengaging at the bottom of a pipeline has a large influence on the overall mechanical properties of the pipeline the stress state has a large adverse change and the vertical displacement also increases to varying degrees as our tests confirm polymer grouting technology can treat and repair disengaged pipelines with excellent results we found the strains and displacements of a repaired pipeline subjected to stresses to be close to those of a normal pipeline our reported results are only applicable to the specific soil pipe properties pipe laying techniques and load conditions tested despite the limited scope of the testing and many unknown factors at the site we were able to complete tests under relatively controlled conditions and to draw some useful conclusions our tests also provided an opportunity for validation of existing design methods and finite element analyses for these specific conditions against a known dataset on the basis of these results we plan more elaborate

22834,stiffness of flexible connectors has great impacts on responses of multi modular floating systems but how to properly layout the anisotropic stiffness of connectors is unsettled yet this paper presents a general approach to determine the stiffness configuration for various wave conditions a genetic algorithm based routine procedure is thus proposed which is capable to handle quite large number of influential factors in a decision making process the linear weighted sum method is used for the preferences on individual objectives according to specific engineering requirements tolerances and constraints in numerical studies of eight modular floating system the optimal stiffness configuration is found in a full scenario of weight combinations it indicates that the combination of small longitudinal stiffness large transversal and large vertical stiffness is favorable for most wave conditions this work makes the tedious task of the stiffness design be easy keywords multi modular floating system flexible connector stiffness configuration optimization process 1 introduction very large floating structure vlfs is a unique concept of oceanic structures proposed for potential applications such as floating airports storage facilities for oil and natural gas military and emergency bases floating farms and so on wang and tay 2011 a large number of research works have been carried out in 1993 brown root proposed a conceptual design where six semi submersible modules were rigidly connected together to form a floating structure in the size of 914 m long 91 m wide and 65 m depth mcallister 1997 several years later a research project of mobile offshore bases mob was executed by the office of naval research onr as an alternative solution for mobile military base palo 2005 zueck et al 2009 almost around the same time the research and development on the mega float was undertaken as a japanese national project by the technological research association of mega float tram sasajima 2002 mob and mega float are two landmark projects with great influence on the development of vlfs technology as summarized in lamas pardo s work lamas pardo et al 2015 because of the large size of vlfs a single continuum structure could cause massive loads in the structure the type of multi modular floating platforms with connectors is preferred which is convenient for construction transportation and deployment watanabe et al 2004 thus the connector becomes a key component for the multi modular floating systems different kinds of connectors have been proposed for modular connections simple hinge connector is the most common one firstly proposed for vlfs this type of the connector completely releases the pitch motion among modules so that the bending stress in the structure is greatly reduced but translational loads of the hinge connector are still large the connection load becomes a critical issue for the design of modular connection comparing with hinge connector the compliant connector or called flexible connector can significantly reduce the connector loads with some tolerances on structural flexibility in this regard the compliant connector enhanced compliant connector and modified compliant connector were sequentially proposed haney 1999 xu et al 2014 proposed a kind of flexible connector with trapezoidal rubber cushions and cables where the rubber cushion is mainly used to constrain the longitudinal and transversal motions between adjacent modules when the compression occurs and the cable is used to constrain the longitudinal motion between adjacent modules when the tension occurs rognaas et al 2001 put forward a design of flexible connector with the tolerance in the pitch and yaw motions where elastomeric bearings hydraulic jacks and fenders were utilized to provide elastic supports and steel cables undertook axial tensile forces except for utilizing rubbers or cables as compliant components springs are generally applied to provide elastic connection in wu s work wu et al 2016 four orthogonal linkages equipped with springs were used to restrain the linear displacements where angular rotations were allowed xia et al 2016 designed a special flexible connector with air springs which could alter the stiffness of connector to reduce the oscillation of floating structures by changing the air pressure of the air springs although different designs exhibit their own distinguishing features what is in common is that these flexible connectors provide elastic constraints so that the load level in structure can be ameliorated a prototype design of a flexible connector is associated with the stiffness configuration and the strength analysis since the stiffness of flexible connectors has a great impact on the connector loads and the responses of multi modular floating systems therefore the stiffness configuration is the precondition of strength analysis some efforts have been made to understand the effect of the stiffness on the responses of multi modular floating systems a multi plate floating system connected with torsion springs was studied indicating that the torsion spring stiffness greatly influences the vibration amplitude of the main structures khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2002 xia et al 2000 investigated the hydroelastic behavior of two dimensional articulated plates connected by idealized connectors which were treated as a series of flexural rotational springs and vertical linear springs it indicates that the hydroelastic response strongly depended on the stiffness of the springs and the incoming wave frequency the effect of the stiffness of connectors on the hydroelastic response of vlfs were studied fu et al 2007 riyansyah et al 2010 and gao et al 2011 investigated the effect of the location and rotational stiffness of the connector for reducing the hydroelastic response and stress resultants of the vlfs and they found that appropriate position and stiffness of connectors could improve the response of the floating system in these works mentioned above the stiffness of flexible connectors was commonly treated as identical in different directions the simple treatment is certainly not a good choice since the connection loads in different degrees of freedom are dissimilar and the flexibility restriction in different directions is not concerned an early work done by riggs et al 1999 studied thirteen different connector stiffness cases in which the longitudinal and vertical stiffness varied and the transversal stiffness was fixed at a large value the results indicated that different stiffness cases might cause different impact on the system dynamic responses and connector loads zhang et al 2017a b proposed three types of flexible connector configurations to represent anisotropic stiffness models and investigated the effect of the different stiffness on the global stability of the multi modular floating system with amplitude death mechanism zhang et al 2015a b where a preferred parameter domain for the stiffness and wave period was suggested presently a variety of connections tan et al 2018 zhang et al 2017a b utilized in ocean production system have been widely investigated to provide guidance for structural optimization however for the connections of vlfs there have been only some works done especially on the role of connector stiffness and the understanding of this issue is somehow fragmented it is because the effect of connector stiffness is also associated with many other factors such as the wave incident angles and frequencies specific engineering requirements on the stationary module responses and connection loads and so on without comprehensively including the most influential factors into consideration it is impossible to obtain a full understanding of the effect this is why there has been no confident solution for the stiffness arrangement of flexible connectors yet on this specific topic there has been a lack of the systematic guideline how to layout the stiffness combination for flexible connectors and the corresponding routine procedure is still unavailable this topic is very important because a well designed connector is a guarantee for the successful implementation of modularized vlfs motivated by its significance we attempt to develop a comprehensive approach that can be used to determine the stiffness configuration of connectors upon engineering requirements in this paper a general strategy is studied for resolving the stiffness configuration for flexible connectors in various wave conditions with the rigid module flexible connector rmfc and linear spring model a routine procedure is proposed for an optimal solution of the stiffness configuration subject to specific requirements tolerances and constraints the routine procedure is designed by a genetic algorithm based searing program in addition with multi layer iterative optimizations the decision process handles quite number of influential factors with weighted evaluation functions the guideline for the weight assignment is elaborated in conjunction with preferences on specific concerns in engineering applications in numerical studies an eight modular floating system is considered a full scenario of weight combinations is investigated to find a general stiffness configuration for flexible connectors generally suitable for a variety of wave conditions 2 mathematical model of multi modular floating systems with flexible connectors a three dimensional multi modular floating system with flexible connectors is considered in irregular waves the rmfc model ertekin et al 1993 riggs et al 2000 wang et al 1991 is established for dynamic analysis with a frequency domain approach where the modules of vlfs are assumed rigid and all deformations occur at the flexible connectors the flexible connectors are usually treated as linear springs in three translational directions which restrain linear displacements but allow angular rotations wu et al 2016 this paper focuses on the stiffness design of flexible connectors associated with engineering requirements and constraints in different sea states 2 1 description of multi modular floating systems a multi modular floating system consists of a number of identical semi submersible floating modules which are end to end coupled via flexible connectors fig 1 shows the multi modular floating system where n indicates the module number the oxyz coordinate is the global coordinate the xoy plane is on the free surface of liquid the x axis points to longitudinal direction of the floating system and the z axis is vertically upward the symbol ψ indicates the incident wave angle there are several flexible connectors installed between two adjacent modules and symmetrically distributed about the longitudinal axis the ox n y n z n is the local coordinate for the n th module whose origin is at the center of gravity cg of the module the direction of each axis is the same as that of the global coordinate 2 2 linear hydrodynamic model assuming that the water is irrotational and inviscid the linear wave theory is utilized to determine the hydrodynamic forces considering a regular wave with frequency ω and an incident angle ψ the total space velocity potential for a multi modular floating system including n modules can be written as 1 φ φ i φ d i ω i 1 n x i φ i in which φ i and φ d indicate incident and diffraction potential respectively and i 1 x i x i y i z i α i β i γ i t indicates the complex amplitude of the i th module which corresponds to the complex amplitudes of surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw motions respectively φ i φ i x φ i y φ i z φ i α φ i β φ i γ is the normalized radiation potential for the i th module due to a unit amplitude motion with all other modules fixed the incident potential φ i for constant water depth h is given by 2 ϕ i ⅈ g a ω cosh k z h cosh k h exp ⅈ k x cos ψ y sin ψ where g is the acceleration of gravity and the symbol a denotes wave amplitude k denotes the wave number which satisfies the dispersion relation ω 2 g k tanh k h the diffraction potential φ d and normalized radiation potential φ i satisfy the laplace equation in the fluid domain the linearized boundary conditions on the water free surface and seabed and the sommerfeld radiation condition at infinitely distance from the modules the relevant details can be found in the references ertekin et al 1993 wang et al 1991 integrating the pressure over the mean wetted surface of the structures with the help of bernoulli equation the wave force on the i th module takes the following form 3 f i w f i w e i ω t j 1 n a i j x j b i j x j where f i w donates the scattering wave force vector determined by scattering wave potential ϕ s ϕ i ϕ d and j 1 n a ij x j b ij x j denotes the radiation wave force in which x j x j e i w t a ij and b ij are added mass and damping matrices called hydrodynamic coefficients 2 3 dynamic model of multi modular floating systems based on the rmfc model in terms of a single flexible connector its stiffness matrix k s can be defined as 4 k s k x 0 0 0 0 0 0 k y 0 0 0 0 0 0 k z 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 where k x k y and k z denote the three translational stiffness of the connector without considering rotational stiffness it is assumed that the module i and module j are coupled by n c connectors considering the q th connector between the module i and module j the displacements of the connection points for the q th connector on the module i and module j can be written respectively as 5 μ i q t i q x i μ j q t j q x j where x i and x j indicate the displacement vectors of the module i and module j t i q and t j q represent the displacement transformation matrices of the connection points for the q th connector related to the cgs of the module i and module j whose general form is expressed as 6 t s q 1 0 0 0 z s q y s q 0 1 0 z s q 0 x s q 0 0 1 y s q x s q 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 where x s q y s q z s q donates the local coordinate of the connection point for the q th connector on the s th module and the subscript s represents i or j accordingly the relative displacement of the q th connector between the module i and module j can be obtained by 7 δ μ i j q μ j q μ i q the load on the q th connector between the module i and module j can be written as 8 f i j q k s δ μ i j q thus the load acting on the cg of module i provided by the q th connector can be obtained from eq 9 with transformation matrix which takes the following form 9 f i j m q t i q t f i j q t i q t k s δ μ i j q if there are n c connectors installed between the module i and module j the total load on the module i due to these connectors can be written as 10 f i j m q 1 n c f i j m q q 1 n c t i q t k s δ μ i j q in a multi modular floating system with n modules considering the wave load and connector load the governing equation for the system takes the following form 11 m i x i j 1 n a i j x i b i j x i s i x i f i w e i ω t q 1 n c t i q t k s δ μ i j q i 1 2 n where m i and s i indicate the mass matrix and the coefficient matrix of water restoring force the formulae of these coefficients has been well studied and readers can refer to the paper zhang et al 2015a b for more details the governing equation is used for dynamic analysis in random seas based on the frequency domain approach yu et al 2003 2 4 responses in irregular waves the dynamic response of the floating system in irregular waves can be determined by means of spectrum analysis according to the transfer function and the rayleigh probability distribution of the wave amplitude the amplitude of the short term extreme response r e is given by 12 r e 3 72 m 0 m 0 0 h 2 ω s η ω ⅆ ω where h ω is the transfer function of the response in frequency domain and s η ω indicates the spectrum density function of waves in this paper jonswap spectrum is utilized which takes the following form 13 s η ω α g 2 ω 5 e 5 4 ω ω p 4 ζ e 0 5 ω ω p σ ω p 2 in which the symbol γ denotes spectral peak parameter the peak wave frequency is ω p 2 π t p when ω ω p the peak shape parameter σ 0 07 otherwise σ 0 09 and α can be obtained by 14 α 5 16 h s 2 ω p 4 g 2 1 0 287 ln ζ 3 stiffness configuration of flexible connectors a suitable stiffness arrangement for different directions of a flexible connector can help to improve the performance and survivability of the system in rough sea which is a matter of great significance for the study of multi modular floating systems the stiffness configuration is also a prerequisite before the prototype design of the connector and strength analysis in this section a general strategy for setting up an optimization model is proposed to determine stiffness configuration 3 1 statement of optimization many factors could affect analysis results of stiffness configuration including the wave frequency wave incident angle the stiffness level of connectors the topological feature of floating structures the preference requirements on connection load limits and operation requirement on the stationary of the floating platform and so on we attempt to develop a general strategy to determine the stiffness configuration of flexible connectors with a comprehensive consideration of all the factors an optimization approach will be proposed in the decision making process as for design purposes we wish to achieve a relatively stationary state in the responses of floating modules in the main frequency domain of wave spectrum which is crucial for the system operation we also wish the connector loads should be as small as possible to ease the difficulty of the prototype design of the connector and to enhance the safety and reliability of the system they both relate to the dynamic response of the floating system but the goals are conflicted with each other since the response of a floating system not only depends on the connector stiffness but also other factors such as the wave condition the structure of the floating modules etc including many other specific engineering concerns obviously it is a typical multi objective optimization problem subject to a numbers of constraints a general expression of multi objective optimization problem takes the form mukta et al 2012 15 o p t f 1 φ f 2 φ f k φ φ t where k φ is the number of objective functions f i φ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ n t is a vector of functions containing decision variables since optimization objectives are usually in contradiction it is impossible to find an optimal solution to satisfy with all the objectives simultaneously halevy et al 2006 therefore an overall objective function has to be established through weights to balance the individual goals a weight is assigned to each individual objective function to count for the contribution of individual objectives therefore the weight distribution is very much dependent on the intention of designers we intend to use the linear weighted sum method to build up the overall objective function the objective function can be formed as follows 16 u i 1 m ω i f i φ subject to 17 g φ 0 18 h φ 0 in eq 17 weighting coefficient has the property of ω i 0 i 1 m ω i 1 accordingly the multi objective optimization problem is translated into a single objective optimization problem where individual objectives are compromised to achieve an overall best result besides eq 18 and eq 19 are referred as the inequality constraint and the equality constraint respectively on the premise of meeting the requirements it is expected that the optimum solution of the design variables can be found in feasible regions to make the objective function reach to a minimum 3 2 objective function and constraints now we formulate the objective function associated with multi modular floating systems consider that two adjacent modules are connected by two parallel flexible connectors symmetrically in the x direction with the ignorance of torsion bending deformations of the flexible connector thus the stiffness of the connector can be expressed by k x k y and k z in the three translational directions respectively since the stiffness allows varying in a wide range during an optimization process we prefer to express the stiffness in the form of k x 10 p x k y 10 p y and k z 10 p z where p p x p y p z t is a vector of the power coefficients for the stiffness in different directions which are the decision variables to be determined in an optimization process the stiffness matrix of a flexible connector can be defined as 19 k 10 p x 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 p y 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 p z 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 optimization process determines the values of p x p y and p z and yields a stiffness combination of a flexible connector in the optimization process we concern about the stationary of the floating system and thus the objectives should include all the responses of modules and the relative displacements between adjacent modules we also concern about the connector loads that should be included into the optimization objectives therefore a preliminary objective function can be formed as 21 v s a f b δ r c r where f δ r and r denote the connector load relative displacement and modular response the symbols a b and c denote the weight coefficients for the three objectives where a b c 1 note that the three objective functions are usually represented by different measure units a normalization is required for all the objectives the assigned values for the weights imposed on the objectives should reflect the decision maker s preferences jia et al 1998 which will be discussed later the optimal solution largely depends on the weights of objectives therefore different weight vectors should be given for different requirements in engineering applications srinivas and deb 1995 the connector load f is a vector composed by three components of the longitudinal load f 1 transversal load f 2 and vertical load f 3 in each translational direction the normalization of the three load components takes the following form 22 f 1 f x f x 0 f 2 f y f y 0 f 3 f z f z 0 where f x f y and f z are the average loads of all the flexible connectors and f x 0 f y 0 and f z 0 are the average connector loads when the three stiffness components are set to the maximum in the feasible regions a case of almost rigid connection therefore the connector load with normalization f can be written as 23 f i 1 3 a i f i where a i is the weight coefficient for each translational load f i i 1 3 a i 1 how to assign the values of the weights will be discussed in the case study later as for the response and relative displacement each of them contains six components here we take the relative displacement for example to describe the normalization the normalization for response is similarly treated the relative displacement includes six components of relative surge δ r 1 sway δ r 2 heave δ r 3 roll δ r 4 pitch δ r 5 and yaw δ r 6 the six relative displacement components in the normalization form are written as 24 δ r 1 δ x δ x 0 δ r 2 δ y δ y 0 δ r 3 δ z δ z 0 δ r 4 δ α δ α 0 δ r 5 δ β δ β 0 δ r 6 δ γ δ γ 0 where δ x δ y δ z δ α δ β and δ γ respectively indicate the average relative displacements between all the adjacent modules δ x 0 δ y 0 δ z 0 δ α 0 δ β 0 and δ γ 0 are the average relative displacements when the three stiffness components are set to the minimum of the feasible regions a case of very flexible connection accordingly the relative displacements with normalization can be written as 25 δ r i 1 6 b i δ r i in eq 25 b i is the weight coefficient for each relative displacement δ r i i 1 6 b i 1 likewise the response with the normalization r can be written as 26 r i 1 6 c i r i where c i is the weight coefficient for r i i 1 6 c i 1 the readers might be curious about why the case of very rigid connection is chosen for normalizing the connector loads and the case of very weak connection is chosen for normalizing the relative displacement and modular response it is because that a very rigid connection causes extreme high connector loads and on the contrary while a very weak connection causes the extreme large responses when the terms are divided by their extreme values the magnitudes of these objective terms can be scaled in the nearly same rank so that the different objectives can be compared at an equal level as for the constraint it very much depends on the specific requirements of applications for examples we can require that average pitch motion of all modules must be smaller than a certain value that yields a constraint r 5 δ we can also require the connector loads in the transversal direction must not exceed a limit that yields f 2 f 3 ε the stiffness of connector must be not bounded within a range of l b l p l u b l the response of modules excited by waves must satisfy with the governing equations etc thus the final optimization statement can be addressed as 27 min v p a i 1 3 a i f i b i 1 6 b i δ r i c i 1 6 c i r

are the lower and upper boundaries of the feasible regions and δ i ε i are the specific requirements on the limitations 3 3 optimization algorithm since the objective function may be multimodal some simple optimization techniques saravanan et al 2002 may not be suitable for finding a global optimum solution thus a non traditional genetic algorithm ga is employed to solve the optimization problem in this paper ga is an iterative procedure combining survivals of the fittest to search for an appropriate solution in each generation a new population of candidate solutions is created by means of specific genetic operators mitchell 1998 the procedure will not stop searching until the final solution meets requirements in this paper we use the ga tool integrated in matlab to find the optimum solution of the objective function eq 27 after assigning the weights for objectives and the wave condition ga becomes a core searching program to obtain a specific optimal stiffness combination for flexible connectors at a specific incident wave angle around the core there is one more layer of iterative optimization to find the optimal stiffness combination that can be widely suitable for different wave angles as shown in fig 2 the second round optimization process is stated as follows ga generates an optimum result for each specific wave angle and there are a number of optimum results produced in a range of wave angles we want to find the most suitable optimal solution among the wave angles we need to reappraise these optimal results by calculating the average evaluation function v p i of all optimum results for the different wave angles it takes the form 28 v p i 1 m j 1 m v j p i where p i i 1 2 m is the optimum result for the i th wave angle and its general form can be expressed as p i p x i p y i p z i t where p x i p y i and p z i are the three decision variables v j j 1 2 m indicates the objective function for the j th wave angle for each optimum result p i the average evaluation function v p i can be obtained by eq 28 which actually represents the average performance of the current optimum stiffness combination accordingly we compare the values of the average evaluation function v p i the result that makes the value of v p i minimum is regard as the final optimum result which means that the result has the best average performance in summary the optimization includes two steps shown in fig 2 in the first round of optimization we screen the solutions in parameter region p x p y p z to gain the optimum result of each wave angle after that the second round of optimization is carried out reappraising the final optimum result 4 numerical case studies 4 1 parameters of modules and waves a multi modular floating system is considered which consists of eight modules every two adjacent modules are coupled by two flexible connectors which are located at the deck of the modules and symmetric about longitudinal axis the horizontal spacing of the two connectors is 58 m and the vertical distance from their locations to the cgs of the module is 15 m regarding the arrangement of the connection our previous study has indicated that the connection position may affect the loads of connectors but influence a little on the stiffness configuration therefore this work does not include the arrangement of the connection in the optimization routing in terms of each module it is constructed by one upper hull five parallel lower hulls and ten columns five columns for each side shown in fig 3 more information about the design parameters are shown in table 1 in the following analysis three irregular sea conditions are considered as the case studies as tabulated in table 2 where the significant wave height and peak period are different the parameter ξ 2 0 is used in calculation fig 4 shows the wave spectra for the three sea conditions where the wave energies of the three cases are mainly distributed in the period range from 2s to 12s from 3s to 14s and from 4s to 20s 4 2 settings of weight coefficients and ga before setting up the weights and feasible regions for the optimization we need to know how the connector stiffness affects the responses of the floating system and the connector loads here a multi modular floating system for sea condition 1 is investigated to examine the effect of connector stiffness in different wave incident angles since the modules are coupled the synchronous phenomena happen among modules in different degrees of freedom which means that all the modules have similar behaviors zhang et al 2015a b therefore the average responses of all the modules and average connector loads of all the connectors could be used to aptly reflect the main characteristics of modules for the convenience of the study we firstly assume that the three components of connector stiffness are equal namely k x k y k z k fig 5 illustrates the contour graphs of average responses in six degrees of freedom and the average connector loads in three translational directions in the parameter region ψ k as shown in fig 5 a to f the average response peaks of modules mainly appear in the interval of 10 6 n m k 10 11 n m for all the degrees of freedom as the stiffness k is less than 10 6 n m or greater than 10 11 n m the responses stay at low levels and contour lines remain constant insensitive to the change of the stiffness it indicates that the responses are mainly affected by incident wave angle rather than the stiffness when the stiffness is large or small fig 5 g to i show the contour plots of average connector loads similarly the resonance peaks occur in the interval of 10 6 n m k 10 11 n m and the connector loads mainly depend on the wave angles when the stiffness k is less than 10 6 n m or greater than 10 11 n m it is similar for the relative displacements between adjacent modules not illustrated here we thus conclude that for any specific incident wave angle when the connector stiffness is smaller or larger than certain values the change of stiffness has little impact on the response of modules and connection loads this conclusion is also suitable for the case of anisotropic stiffness in different directions based on our observation in numerical tests in this regard fig 5 provides a clue for setting up a feasible design region for the stiffness decision variables namely all the three stiffness components should be confined within the range from 106 to 1011 next we elaborate how to set up the weights for optimization the weight coefficients in fact reflect the preference of objectives which mainly depends on the concerns of engineering applications taking floating airport as an example the stationary state is critically concerned for the operation so that heavy weights may be necessary for the response and relative displacement respectively to be more specific the heave and pitch motions are the most concerned responses for the aircraft takeoff and landing operations on floating airports especially for a landing aircraft pilot has to carefully observe and predict the runway motions in heave and pitch in order to have a safe landing sidar and doolin 1983 in this regard in order to reduce the heave and pitch motions heavy weights are assigned in these two direction motions if the connection loads become major concerns for the strength and safety large weight should be imposed on the connector loads or directly set an upper limit for the connector loads in the constraint condition the setting of weight coefficients is somehow subjective pretty much based on the requirements of a particular application in following numerical studies we intend to investigate the stiffness configuration in a full scenario of weight combinations based on various preferences there are basically four groups of weights are considered as shown in table 3 the first group of weights reflects the case where the connector loads are more concerned 60 than the responses 40 the second group indicates an equal concern on the loads and responses 50 50 the third group gives more concerns on the responses 60 than the loads 40 and the fourth group assigns 70 weight on the response and 30 weight on the loads the third and fourth columns indicate the preferred sub weights assigned to sub terms these sub weights reflect specific concerns on different aspects in the optimization the key parameters of ga in matlab are set as follows the population size is set to 100 the generations are set to 100 and the function tolerance is equal to 10 6 using a particular set of weights the optimization procedure can find the optimal result for each wave angle 4 3 optimal stiffness configuration here an eight modular floating system is considered in sea condition 1 for the case study to determine the optimum connector stiffness fig 6 illustrates the optimum results for each wave angle from 0 to 90 with an increase step of 5 with the set of weights a 0 5 b c 0 25 a 1 a 2 a 3 0 33 b 1 b 2 b 4 b 6 0 1 b 3 b 5 0 3 c 1 c 2 c 4 c 6 0 1 c 3 c 5 0 3 it can be seen that for most wave angles the results show that small longitudinal stiffness and large transversal and vertical stiffness are the best stiffness configuration p x 6 p y p z 11 except for the wave angles at 75 and 90 obviously the best stiffness combination is somehow dependent on the wave incident angles to determine a final optimal solution of the stiffness configuration in a full span of wave angles we need to reappraise these individual optimal results as mentioned before accordingly the final optimal results for the different groups of weights are obtained shown in the last three columns of table 3 the final results tabulated in table 3 have included the effect of wave angles the results for the weight group where the preference of load is 0 7 show that the optimal result remains the configuration p x 6 p y 11 p z 6 whenever the preferences of heave and pitch motions are 0 4 0 3 or 0 2 however in the weight group where the preference of load is 0 6 the result for the first row of weights in the fourth column shows that the best stiffness configuration is of p x 6 p y 11 p z 6 while the second row of the weights in the fourth column shows that the best stiffness configuration is of p x 6 p y p z 11 the difference between the two cases is the settings of sub weights the former has the sub weights of b 3 b 5 0 2 and c 3 c 5 0 2 the later has the sub weights of b 3 b 5 0 3 and c 3 c 5 0 3 the slight preference of the sub weights on the heave and pitch motions makes the optimal results very different although the both are in the same weight group it is interesting to see that the rest optimization results for different weight groups are quite consistent given at p x 6 p y p z 11 this result indicates that the stiffness combination of small longitudinal stiffness large transversal and large vertical stiffness is favored for most of cases when the response is treated as equal as or more important than the load in these cases the preference on the heave and pitch responses has no influence on the final result the optimization results are quite consistent for different scenarios of weight combinations it means that this stiffness configuration is widely applicable to the sea state the rationality of the stiffness configuration can be further confirmed from fig 5 the longitudinal load is larger than both transversal and vertical load in most situations small longitudinal stiffness can help reduce the longitudinal load which will improve the stress condition of connectors effectively meanwhile it will not cause very large surge response and based on the optimization requirements appropriate surge motion could be tolerated therefore the small longitudinal stiffness corresponds to the acceptable level surge motion in fig 5 a and low level longitudinal load in fig 5 g similarly the large transversal stiffness corresponds to the low level sway motion in fig 5 b and low level yaw motion in fig 5 f as well as the low level transversal load as wave angle is less than 70 in fig 5 h the large vertical stiffness corresponds to the low level heave motion in fig 5 c and low level pitch motion in fig 5 e because of the vertical movement constraint but the vertical load is not small in fig 5 g a kind of trade off relationship finally we examine the viability of the proposed approach for different sea conditions it is necessary to verify whether the stiffness configuration found by the above approach is valid for different sea conditions in table 2 the sea conditions have different wave heights and dominant wave periods in the numerical study the group of weights a 0 5 b c 0 25 a 1 a 2 a 3 0 33 b 1 b 2 b 4 b 6 0 1 b 3 b 5 0 3 c 1 c 2 c 4 c 6 0 1 c 3 c 5 0 3 is used to form objective functions fig 7 illustrates the same results of p x 6 p y p z 11 for the stiffness combination in the three sea conditions it seems that the proposed strategy works well and the optimum result is available to different sea conditions we have also examined other groups of weights for the tests and the results are all similar in order to illustrate the advantages of the optimum stiffness configuration flexible connectors based on the optimum stiffness configuration and rigid hinge connectors are investigated respectively fig 8 gives the information about maximal connection loads as shown in fig 8 a to c it is obvious to see that compared with the rigid hinge connection the optimum stiffness configuration contributes to reduce the loads on flexible connectors largely especially at 85 to be more specific the maximal longitudinal load on flexible connectors is decreased most obviously with a distinct difference of two orders of magnitude and meanwhile the maximal transversal and vertical loads are also reduced by 17 and 68 respectively fig 9 illustrates a comparison of maximal module responses as observed in fig 9 f although the maximal yaw motion of the system with flexible connectors is larger than that of the system with rigid hinge connectors its value is small posing a negligible influence for the motions in other degrees of freedom shown in fig 9 a to e the optimum stiffness configuration doesn t cause a great difference compared with rigid hinge connectors in most occasions but brings about an obvious reduction for heave and pitch motion at 85 to summarize the stiffness configuration of connectors with small longitudinal stiffness and large transversal and vertical stiffness is favorable for most wave conditions the approach developed in this paper is general and capable to handle many influential factors into considerations optimal result is subject to preferences on special requirements with this developed approach it becomes easy to resolve an optimal stiffness configuration for flexible connectors 5 conclusions this paper presents a general strategy for the determination of the stiffness configuration for flexible connectors according to specific requirements based on the rfmc and linear spring model a ga based routine procedure is proposed to find an optimal stiffness configuration of flexible connectors subject to requirements tolerances and constraints the decision process involves many influential factors and the weight distribution for objective functions is introduced for the optimization process the guideline for the weight assignment is elaborated in conjunction with preference on specific concerns in engineering applications a full scenario of weight combination is investigated and the stiffness configuration for flexible connectors is found by using the multi layer optimization model the resultant solution indicates that the stiffness combination of small longitudinal stiffness large transversal and large vertical stiffness is most favorable however in the present optimization strategy the connector is simplified with the ignorance of torsion bending stiffness and nonlinear character is not considered in the future work a more comprehensive connector model and nonlinear character will be taken into consideration to improve the procedure regardless of these the optimization strategy is still effectual which develops a general and systematic tool to determine the connector stiffness among tremendous influential factors is important for real applications of modularized vlfs acknowledgement this research work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no

22834,stiffness of flexible connectors has great impacts on responses of multi modular floating systems but how to properly layout the anisotropic stiffness of connectors is unsettled yet this paper

number of influential factors in a decision making process the linear weighted sum method is used for the preferences on individual objectives according to specific engineering requirements tolerances and constraints in numerical studies of eight modular floating system the optimal stiffness configuration is found in a full scenario of weight combinations it indicates that the combination of small longitudinal stiffness large transversal and large vertical stiffness is favorable for most wave conditions this work makes the tedious task of the stiffness design be easy keywords multi modular floating system flexible connector stiffness configuration optimization process 1 introduction very large floating structure vlfs is a unique concept of oceanic structures proposed for potential applications such as floating airports storage facilities for oil and natural gas military and emergency bases floating farms and so on wang and tay 2011 a large number of research works have been carried out in 1993 brown root proposed a conceptual design where six semi submersible modules were rigidly connected together to form a floating structure in the size of 914 m long 91 m wide and 65 m depth mcallister 1997 several years later a research project of mobile offshore bases mob was executed by the office of naval research onr as an alternative solution for mobile military base palo 2005 zueck et al 2009 almost around the same time the research and development on the mega float was undertaken as a japanese national project by the technological research association of mega float tram sasajima 2002 mob and mega float are two landmark projects with great influence on the development of vlfs technology as summarized in lamas pardo s work lamas pardo et al 2015 because of the large size of vlfs a single continuum structure could cause massive loads in the structure the type of multi modular floating platforms with connectors is preferred which is convenient for construction transportation and deployment watanabe et al 2004 thus the connector becomes a key component for the multi modular floating systems different kinds of connectors have been proposed for modular connections simple hinge connector is the most common one firstly proposed for vlfs this type of the connector completely releases the pitch motion among modules so that the bending stress in the structure is greatly reduced but translational loads of the hinge connector are still large the connection load becomes a critical issue for the design of modular connection comparing with hinge connector the compliant connector or called flexible connector can significantly reduce the connector loads with some tolerances on structural flexibility in this regard the compliant connector enhanced compliant connector and modified compliant connector were sequentially proposed haney 1999 xu et al 2014 proposed a kind of flexible connector with trapezoidal rubber cushions and cables where the rubber cushion is mainly used to constrain the longitudinal and transversal motions between adjacent modules when the compression occurs and the cable is used to constrain the longitudinal motion between adjacent modules when the tension occurs rognaas et al 2001 put forward a design of flexible connector with the tolerance in the pitch and yaw motions where elastomeric bearings hydraulic jacks and fenders were utilized to provide elastic supports and steel cables undertook axial tensile forces except for utilizing rubbers or cables as compliant components springs are generally applied to provide elastic connection in wu s work wu et al 2016 four orthogonal linkages equipped with springs were used to restrain the linear displacements where angular rotations were allowed xia et al 2016 designed a special flexible connector with air springs which could alter the stiffness of connector to reduce the oscillation of floating structures by changing the air pressure of the air springs although different designs exhibit their own distinguishing features what is in common is that these flexible connectors provide elastic constraints so that the load level in structure can be ameliorated a prototype design of a flexible connector is associated with the stiffness configuration and the strength analysis since the stiffness of flexible connectors has a great impact on the connector loads and the responses of multi modular floating systems therefore the stiffness configuration is the precondition of strength analysis some efforts have been made to understand the effect of the stiffness on the responses of multi modular floating systems a multi plate floating system connected with torsion springs was studied indicating that the torsion spring stiffness greatly influences the vibration amplitude of the main structures khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2002 xia et al 2000 investigated the hydroelastic behavior of two dimensional articulated plates connected by idealized connectors which were treated as a series of flexural rotational springs and vertical linear springs it indicates that the hydroelastic response strongly depended on the stiffness of the springs and the incoming wave frequency the effect of the stiffness of connectors on the hydroelastic response of vlfs were studied fu et al 2007 riyansyah et al 2010 and gao et al 2011 investigated the effect of the location and rotational stiffness of the connector for reducing the hydroelastic response and stress resultants of the vlfs and they found that appropriate position and stiffness of connectors could improve the response of the floating system in these works mentioned above the stiffness of flexible connectors was commonly treated as identical in different directions the simple treatment is certainly not a good choice since the connection loads in different degrees of freedom are dissimilar and the flexibility restriction in different directions is not concerned an early work done by riggs et al 1999 studied thirteen different connector stiffness cases in which the longitudinal and vertical stiffness varied and the transversal stiffness was fixed at a large value the results indicated that different stiffness cases might cause different impact on the system dynamic responses and connector loads zhang et al 2017a b proposed three types of flexible connector configurations to represent anisotropic stiffness models and investigated the effect of the different stiffness on the global stability of the multi modular floating system with amplitude death mechanism zhang et al 2015a b where a preferred parameter domain for the stiffness and wave period was suggested presently a variety of connections tan et al 2018 zhang et al 2017a b utilized in ocean production system have been widely investigated to provide guidance for structural optimization however for the connections of vlfs there have been only some works done especially on the role of connector stiffness and the understanding of this issue is somehow fragmented it is because the effect of connector stiffness is also associated with many other factors such as the wave incident angles and frequencies specific engineering requirements on the stationary module responses and connection loads and so on without comprehensively including the most influential factors into consideration it is impossible to obtain a full understanding of the effect this is why there has been no confident solution for the stiffness arrangement of flexible connectors yet on this specific topic there has been a lack of the systematic guideline how to layout the stiffness combination for flexible connectors and the corresponding routine procedure is still unavailable this topic is very important because a well designed connector is a guarantee for the successful implementation of modularized vlfs motivated by its significance we attempt to develop a comprehensive approach that can be used to determine the stiffness configuration of connectors upon engineering requirements in this paper a general strategy is studied for resolving the stiffness configuration for flexible connectors in various wave conditions with the rigid module flexible connector rmfc and linear spring model a routine procedure is proposed for an optimal solution of the stiffness configuration subject to specific requirements tolerances and constraints the routine procedure is designed by a genetic algorithm based searing program in addition with multi layer iterative optimizations the decision process handles quite number of influential factors with weighted evaluation functions the guideline for the weight assignment is elaborated in conjunction with preferences on specific concerns in engineering applications in numerical studies an eight modular floating system is considered a full scenario of weight combinations is investigated to find a general stiffness configuration for flexible connectors generally suitable for a variety of wave conditions 2 mathematical model of multi modular floating systems with flexible connectors a three dimensional multi modular floating system with flexible connectors is considered in irregular waves the rmfc model ertekin et al 1993 riggs et al 2000 wang et al 1991 is established for dynamic analysis with a frequency domain approach where the modules of vlfs are assumed rigid and all deformations occur at the flexible connectors the flexible connectors are usually treated as linear springs in three translational directions which restrain linear displacements but allow angular rotations wu et al 2016 this paper focuses on the stiffness design of flexible connectors associated with engineering requirements and constraints in different sea states 2 1 description of multi modular floating systems a multi modular floating system consists of a number of identical semi submersible floating modules which are end to end coupled via flexible connectors fig 1 shows the multi modular floating system where n indicates the module number the oxyz coordinate is the global coordinate the xoy plane is on the free surface of liquid the x axis points to longitudinal direction of the floating system and the z axis is vertically upward the symbol ψ indicates the incident wave angle there are several flexible connectors installed between two adjacent modules and symmetrically distributed about the longitudinal axis the ox n y n z n is the local coordinate for the n th module whose origin is at the center of gravity cg of the module the direction of each axis is the same as that of the global coordinate 2 2 linear hydrodynamic model assuming that the water is irrotational and inviscid the linear wave theory is utilized to determine the hydrodynamic forces considering a regular wave with frequency ω and an incident angle ψ the total space velocity potential for a multi modular floating system including n modules can be written as 1 φ φ i φ d i ω i 1 n x i φ i in which φ i and φ d indicate incident and diffraction potential respectively and i 1 x i x i y i z i α i β i γ i t indicates the complex amplitude of the i th module which corresponds to the complex amplitudes of surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw motions respectively φ i φ i x φ i y φ i z φ i α φ i β φ i γ is the normalized radiation potential for the i th module due to a unit amplitude motion with all other modules fixed the incident potential φ i for constant water depth h is given by 2 ϕ i ⅈ g a ω cosh k z h cosh k h exp ⅈ k x cos ψ y sin ψ where g is the acceleration of gravity and the symbol a denotes wave amplitude k denotes the wave number which satisfies the dispersion relation ω 2 g k tanh k h the diffraction potential φ d and normalized radiation potential φ i satisfy the laplace equation in the fluid domain the linearized boundary conditions on the water free surface and seabed and the sommerfeld radiation condition at infinitely distance from the modules the relevant details can be found in the references ertekin et al 1993 wang et al 1991 integrating the pressure over the mean wetted surface of the structures with the help of bernoulli equation the wave force on the i th module takes the following form 3 f i w f i w e i ω t j 1 n a i j x j b i j x j where f i w donates the scattering wave force vector determined by scattering wave potential ϕ s ϕ i ϕ d and j 1 n a ij x j b ij x j denotes the radiation wave force in which x j x j e i w t a ij and b ij are added mass and damping matrices called hydrodynamic coefficients 2 3 dynamic model of multi modular floating systems based on the rmfc model in terms of a single flexible connector its stiffness matrix k s can be defined as 4 k s k x 0 0 0 0 0 0 k y 0 0 0 0 0 0 k z 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 where k x k y and k z denote the three translational stiffness of the connector without considering rotational stiffness it is assumed that the module i and module j are coupled by n c connectors considering the q th connector between the module i and module j the displacements of the connection points for the q th connector on the module i and module j can be written respectively as 5 μ i q t i q x i μ j q t j q x j where x i and x j indicate the displacement vectors of the module i and module j t i q and t j q represent the displacement transformation matrices of the connection points for the q th connector related to the cgs of the module i and module j whose general form is expressed as 6 t s q 1 0 0 0 z s q y s q 0 1 0 z s q 0 x s q 0 0 1 y s q x s q 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 where x s q y s q z s q donates the local coordinate of the connection point for the q th connector on the s th module and the subscript s represents i or j accordingly the relative displacement of the q th connector between the module i and module j can be obtained by 7 δ μ i j q μ j q μ i q the load on the q th connector between the module i and module j can be written as 8 f i j q k s δ μ i j q thus the load acting on the cg of module i provided by the q th connector can be obtained from eq 9 with transformation matrix which takes the following form 9 f i j m q t i q t f i j q t i q t k s δ μ i j q if there are n c connectors installed between the module i and module j the total load on the module i due to these connectors can be written as 10 f i j m q 1 n c f i j m q q 1 n c t i q t k s δ μ i j q in a multi modular floating system with n modules considering the wave load and connector load the governing equation for the system takes the following form 11 m i x i j 1 n a i j x i b i j x i s i x i f i w e i ω t q 1 n c t i q t k s δ μ i j q i 1 2 n where m i and s i indicate the mass matrix and the coefficient matrix of water restoring force the formulae of these coefficients has been well studied and readers can refer to the paper zhang et al 2015a b for more details the governing equation is used for dynamic analysis in random seas based on the frequency domain approach yu et al 2003 2 4 responses in irregular waves the dynamic response of the floating system in irregular waves can be determined by means of spectrum analysis according to the transfer function and the rayleigh probability distribution of the wave amplitude the amplitude of the short term extreme response r e is given by 12 r e 3 72 m 0 m 0 0 h 2 ω s η ω ⅆ ω where h ω is the transfer function of the response in frequency domain and s η ω indicates the spectrum density function of waves in this paper jonswap spectrum is utilized which takes the following form 13 s η ω α g 2 ω 5 e 5 4 ω ω p 4 ζ e 0 5 ω ω p σ ω p 2 in which the symbol γ denotes spectral peak parameter the peak wave frequency is ω p 2 π t p when ω ω p the peak shape parameter σ 0 07 otherwise σ 0 09 and α can be obtained by 14 α 5 16 h s 2 ω p 4 g 2 1 0 287 ln ζ 3 stiffness configuration of flexible connectors a suitable stiffness arrangement for different directions of a flexible connector can help to improve the performance and survivability of the system in rough sea which is a matter of great significance for the study of multi modular floating systems the stiffness configuration is also a prerequisite before the prototype design of the connector and strength analysis in this section a general strategy for setting up an optimization model is proposed to determine stiffness configuration 3 1 statement of optimization many factors could affect analysis results of stiffness configuration including the wave frequency wave incident angle the stiffness level of connectors the topological feature of floating structures the preference requirements on connection load limits and operation requirement on the stationary of the floating platform and so on we attempt to develop a general strategy to determine the stiffness configuration of flexible connectors with a comprehensive consideration of all the factors an optimization approach will be proposed in the decision making process as for design purposes we wish to achieve a relatively stationary state in the responses of floating modules in the main frequency domain of wave spectrum which is crucial for the system operation we also wish the connector loads should be as small as possible to ease the difficulty of the prototype design of the connector and to enhance the safety and reliability of the system they both relate to the dynamic response of the floating system but the goals are conflicted with each other since the response of a floating system not only depends on the connector stiffness but also other factors such as the wave condition the structure of the floating modules etc including many other specific engineering concerns obviously it is a typical multi objective optimization problem subject to a numbers of constraints a general expression of multi objective optimization problem takes the form mukta et al 2012 15 o p t f 1 φ f 2 φ f k φ φ t where k φ is the number of objective functions f i φ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ n t is a vector of functions containing decision variables since optimization objectives are usually in contradiction it is impossible to find an optimal solution to satisfy with all the objectives simultaneously halevy et al 2006 therefore an overall objective function has to be established through weights to balance the individual goals a weight is assigned to each individual objective function to count for the contribution of individual objectives therefore the weight distribution is very much dependent on the intention of designers we intend to use the linear weighted sum method to build up the overall objective function the objective function can be formed as follows 16 u i 1 m ω i f i φ subject to 17 g φ 0 18 h φ 0 in eq 17 weighting coefficient has the property of ω i 0 i 1 m ω i 1 accordingly the multi objective optimization problem is translated into a single objective optimization problem where individual objectives are compromised to achieve an overall best result besides eq 18 and eq 19 are referred as the inequality constraint and the equality constraint respectively on the premise of meeting the requirements it is expected that the optimum solution of the design variables can be found in feasible regions to make the objective function reach to a minimum 3 2 objective function and constraints now we formulate the objective function associated with multi modular floating systems consider that two adjacent modules are connected by two parallel flexible connectors symmetrically in the x direction with the ignorance of torsion bending deformations of the flexible connector thus the stiffness of the connector can be expressed by k x k y and k z in the three translational directions respectively since the stiffness allows varying in a wide range during an optimization process we prefer to express the stiffness in the form of k x 10 p x k y 10 p y and k z 10 p z where p p x p y p z t is a vector of the power coefficients for the stiffness in different directions which are the decision variables to be determined in an optimization process the stiffness matrix of a flexible connector can be defined as 19 k 10 p x 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 p y 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 p z 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 optimization process determines the values of p x p y and p z and yields a stiffness combination of a flexible connector in the optimization process we concern about the stationary of the floating system and thus the objectives should include all the responses of modules and the relative displacements between adjacent modules we also concern about the connector loads that should be included into the optimization objectives therefore a preliminary objective function can be formed as 21 v s a f b δ r c r where f δ r and r denote the connector load relative displacement and modular response the symbols a b and c denote the weight coefficients for the three objectives where a b c 1 note that the three objective functions are usually represented by different measure units a normalization is required for all the objectives the assigned values for the weights imposed on the objectives should reflect the decision maker s preferences jia et al 1998 which will be discussed later the optimal solution largely depends on the weights of objectives therefore different weight vectors should be given for different requirements in engineering applications srinivas and deb 1995 the connector load f is a vector composed by three components of the longitudinal load f 1 transversal load f 2 and vertical load f 3 in each translational direction the normalization of the three load components takes the following form 22 f 1 f x f x 0 f 2 f y f y 0 f 3 f z f z 0 where f x f y and f z are the average loads of all the flexible connectors and f x 0 f y 0 and f z 0 are the average connector loads when the three stiffness components are set to the maximum in the feasible regions a case of almost rigid connection therefore the connector load with normalization f can be written as 23 f i 1 3 a i f i where a i is the weight coefficient for each translational load f i i 1 3 a i 1 how to assign the values of the weights will be discussed in the case study later as for the response and relative displacement each of them contains six components here we take the relative displacement for example to describe the normalization the normalization for response is similarly treated the relative displacement includes six components of relative surge δ r 1 sway δ r 2 heave δ r 3 roll δ r 4 pitch δ r 5 and yaw δ r 6 the six relative displacement components in the normalization form are written as 24 δ r 1 δ x δ x 0 δ r 2 δ y δ y 0 δ r 3 δ z δ z 0 δ r 4 δ α δ α 0 δ r 5 δ β δ β 0 δ r 6 δ γ δ γ 0 where δ x δ y δ z δ α δ β and δ γ respectively indicate the average relative displacements between all the adjacent modules δ x 0 δ y 0 δ z 0 δ α 0 δ β 0 and δ γ 0 are the average relative displacements when the three stiffness components are set to the minimum of the feasible regions a case of very flexible connection accordingly the relative displacements with normalization can be written as 25 δ r i 1 6 b i δ r i in eq 25 b i is the weight coefficient for each relative displacement δ r i i 1 6 b i 1 likewise the response with the normalization r can be written as 26 r i 1 6 c i r i where c i is the weight coefficient for r i i 1 6 c i 1 the readers might be curious about why the case of very rigid connection is chosen for normalizing the connector loads and the case of very weak connection is chosen for normalizing the relative displacement and modular response it is because that a very rigid connection causes extreme high connector loads and on the contrary while a very weak connection causes the extreme large responses when the terms are divided by their extreme values the magnitudes of these objective terms can be scaled in the nearly same rank so that the different objectives can be compared at an equal level as for the constraint it very much depends on the specific requirements of applications for examples we can require that average pitch motion of all modules must be smaller than a certain value that yields a constraint r 5 δ we can also require the connector loads in the transversal direction must not exceed a limit that yields f 2 f 3 ε the stiffness of connector must be not bounded within a range of l b l p l u b l the response of modules excited by waves must satisfy with the governing equations etc thus the final optimization statement can be addressed as 27 min v p a i 1 3 a i f i b i 1 6 b i δ r i c i 1 6 c i r i s t p l l b l 0 l x y z u b l p l 0 l x y z δ i r i 0 i 1 2 6 ε i f i 0 i 1 2 3 m i x i j 1 n a i j x i b i j x i s i x i f i w e i ω t q 1 n c t i q t k s δ μ i j q 0 i 1 2 n where l b l and u b l are the lower and upper boundaries of the feasible regions and δ i ε i are the specific requirements on the limitations 3 3 optimization algorithm since the objective function may be multimodal some simple optimization techniques saravanan et al 2002 may not be suitable for finding a global optimum solution thus a non traditional genetic algorithm ga is employed to solve the optimization problem in this paper ga is an iterative procedure combining survivals of the fittest to search for an appropriate solution in each generation a new population of candidate solutions is created by means of specific genetic operators mitchell 1998 the procedure will not stop searching until the final solution meets requirements in this paper we use the ga tool integrated in matlab to find the optimum solution of the objective function eq 27 after assigning the weights for objectives and the wave condition ga becomes a core searching program to obtain a specific optimal stiffness combination for flexible connectors at a specific incident wave angle around the core there is one more layer of iterative optimization to find the optimal stiffness combination that can be widely suitable for different wave angles as shown in fig 2 the second round optimization process is stated as follows ga generates an optimum result for each specific wave angle and there are a number of optimum results produced in a range of wave angles we want to find the most suitable optimal solution among the wave angles we need to reappraise these optimal results by calculating the average evaluation function v p i of all optimum results for the different wave angles it takes the form 28 v p i 1 m j 1 m v j p i where p i i 1 2 m is the optimum result for the i th wave angle and its general form can be expressed as p i p x i p y i p z i t where p x i p y i and p z i are the three decision variables v j j 1 2 m indicates the objective function for the j th wave angle for each optimum result p i the average evaluation function v p i can be obtained by eq 28 which actually represents the average performance of the current optimum stiffness combination accordingly we compare the values of the average evaluation function v p i the result that makes the value of v p i minimum is regard as the final optimum result which means that the result has the best average performance in summary the optimization includes two steps shown in fig 2 in the first round of optimization we screen the solutions in parameter region p x p y p z to gain the optimum result of each wave angle after that the second round of optimization is carried out reappraising the final optimum result 4 numerical case studies 4 1 parameters of modules and waves a multi modular floating system is considered which consists of eight modules every two adjacent modules are coupled by two flexible connectors which are located at the deck of the modules and symmetric about longitudinal axis the horizontal spacing of the two connectors is 58 m and the vertical distance from their locations to the cgs of the module is 15 m regarding the arrangement of the connection our previous study has indicated that the connection position may affect the loads of connectors but influence a little on the stiffness configuration therefore this work does not include the arrangement of the connection in the optimization routing in terms of each module it is constructed by one upper hull five parallel lower hulls and ten columns five columns for each side shown in fig 3 more information about the design parameters are shown in table 1 in the following analysis three irregular sea conditions are considered as the case studies as tabulated in table 2 where the significant wave height and peak period are different the parameter ξ 2 0 is used in calculation fig 4 shows the wave spectra for the three sea conditions where the wave energies of the three cases are mainly distributed in the period range from 2s to 12s from 3s to 14s and from 4s to 20s 4 2 settings of weight coefficients and ga before setting up the weights and feasible regions for the optimization we need to know how the connector stiffness affects the responses of the floating system and the connector loads here a multi modular floating system for sea condition 1 is investigated to examine the effect of connector stiffness in different wave incident angles since the modules are coupled the synchronous phenomena happen among modules in different degrees of freedom which means that all the modules have similar behaviors zhang et al 2015a b therefore the average responses of all the modules and average connector loads of all the connectors could be used to aptly reflect the main characteristics of modules for the convenience of the study we firstly assume that the three components of connector stiffness are equal namely k x k y k z k fig 5 illustrates the contour graphs of average responses in six degrees of freedom and the average connector loads in three translational directions in the parameter region ψ k as shown in fig 5 a to f the average response peaks of modules mainly appear in the interval of 10 6 n m k 10 11 n m for all the degrees of freedom as the stiffness k is less than 10 6 n m or greater than 10 11 n m the responses stay at low levels and contour lines remain constant insensitive to the change of the stiffness it indicates that the responses are mainly affected by incident wave angle rather than the stiffness when the stiffness is large or small fig 5 g to i show the contour plots of average connector loads similarly the resonance peaks occur in the interval of 10 6 n m k 10 11 n m and the connector loads mainly depend on the wave angles when the stiffness k is less than 10 6 n m or greater than 10 11 n m it is similar for the relative displacements between adjacent modules not illustrated here we thus conclude that for any specific incident wave angle when the connector stiffness is smaller or larger than certain values the change of stiffness has little impact on the response of modules and connection loads this conclusion is also suitable for the case of anisotropic stiffness in different directions based on our observation in numerical tests in this regard fig 5 provides a clue for setting up a feasible design region for the stiffness decision variables namely all the three stiffness components should be confined within the range from 106 to 1011 next we elaborate how to set up the weights for optimization the weight coefficients in fact reflect the preference of objectives which mainly depends on the concerns of engineering applications taking floating airport as an example the stationary state is critically concerned for the operation so that heavy weights may be necessary for the response and relative displacement respectively to be more specific the heave and pitch motions are the most concerned responses for the aircraft takeoff and landing operations on floating airports especially for a landing aircraft pilot has to carefully observe and predict the runway motions in heave and pitch in order to have a safe landing sidar and doolin 1983 in this regard in order to reduce the heave and pitch motions heavy weights are assigned in these two direction motions if the connection loads become major concerns for the strength and safety large weight should be imposed on the connector loads or directly set an upper limit for the connector loads in the constraint condition the setting of weight coefficients is somehow subjective pretty much based on the requirements of a particular application in following numerical studies we intend to investigate the stiffness configuration in a full scenario of weight combinations based on various preferences there are basically four groups of weights are considered as shown in table 3 the first group of weights reflects the case where the connector loads are more concerned 60 than the responses 40 the second group indicates an equal concern on the loads and responses 50 50 the third group gives more concerns on the responses 60 than the loads 40 and the fourth group assigns 70 weight on the response and 30 weight on the loads the third and fourth columns indicate the preferred sub weights assigned to sub terms these sub weights reflect specific concerns on different aspects in the optimization the key parameters of ga in matlab are set as follows the population size is set to 100 the generations are set to 100 and the function tolerance is equal to 10 6 using a particular set of weights the optimization procedure can find the optimal result for each wave angle 4 3 optimal stiffness configuration here an eight modular floating system is considered in sea condition 1 for the case study to determine the optimum connector stiffness fig 6 illustrates the optimum results for each wave angle from 0 to 90 with an increase step of 5 with the set of weights a 0 5 b c 0 25 a 1 a 2 a 3 0 33 b 1 b 2 b 4 b 6 0 1 b 3 b 5 0 3 c 1 c 2 c 4 c 6 0 1 c 3 c 5 0 3 it can be seen that for most wave angles the results show that small longitudinal stiffness and large transversal and vertical stiffness are the best stiffness configuration p x 6 p y p z 11 except for the wave angles at 75 and 90 obviously the best stiffness combination is somehow dependent on the wave incident angles to determine a final optimal solution of the stiffness configuration in a full span of wave angles we need to reappraise these individual optimal results as mentioned before accordingly the final optimal results for the different groups of weights are obtained shown in the last three columns of table 3 the final results tabulated in table 3 have included the effect of wave angles the results for the weight group where the preference of load is 0 7 show that the optimal result remains the configuration p x 6 p y 11 p z 6 whenever the preferences of heave and pitch motions are 0 4 0 3 or 0 2 however in the weight group where the preference of load is 0 6 the result for the first row of weights in the fourth column shows that the best stiffness configuration is of p x 6 p y 11 p z 6 while the second row of the weights in the fourth column shows that the best stiffness configuration is of p x 6 p y p z 11 the difference between the two cases is the settings of sub weights the former has the sub weights of b 3 b 5 0 2 and c 3 c 5 0 2 the later has the sub weights of b 3 b 5 0 3 and c 3 c 5 0 3 the slight preference of the sub weights on the heave and pitch motions makes the optimal results very different although the both are in the same weight group it is interesting to see that the rest optimization results for different weight groups are quite consistent given at p x 6 p y p z 11 this result indicates that the stiffness combination of small longitudinal stiffness large transversal and large vertical stiffness is favored for most of cases when the response is treated as equal as or more important than the load in these cases the preference on the heave and pitch responses has no influence on the final result the optimization results are quite consistent for different scenarios of weight combinations it means that this stiffness configuration is widely applicable to the sea state the rationality of the stiffness configuration can be further confirmed from fig 5 the longitudinal load is larger than both transversal and vertical load in most situations small longitudinal stiffness can help reduce the longitudinal load which will improve the stress condition of connectors effectively meanwhile it will not cause very large surge response and based on the optimization requirements appropriate surge motion could be tolerated therefore the small longitudinal stiffness corresponds to the acceptable level surge motion in fig 5 a and low level longitudinal load in fig 5 g similarly the large transversal stiffness corresponds to the low level sway motion in fig 5 b and low level yaw motion in fig 5 f as well as the low level transversal load as wave angle is less than 70 in fig 5 h the large vertical stiffness corresponds to the low level heave motion in fig 5 c and low level pitch motion in fig 5 e because of the vertical movement constraint but the vertical load is not small in fig 5 g a kind of trade off relationship finally we examine the viability of the proposed approach for different sea conditions it is necessary to verify whether the stiffness configuration found by the above approach is valid for different sea conditions in table 2 the sea conditions have different wave heights and dominant wave periods in the numerical study the group of weights a 0 5 b c 0 25 a 1 a 2 a 3 0 33 b 1 b 2 b 4 b 6 0 1 b 3 b 5 0 3 c 1 c 2 c 4 c 6 0 1 c 3 c 5 0 3 is used to form objective functions fig 7 illustrates the same results of p x 6 p y p z 11 for the stiffness combination in the three sea conditions it seems that the proposed strategy works well and the optimum result is available to different sea conditions we have also examined other groups of weights for the tests and the results are all similar in order to illustrate the advantages of the optimum stiffness configuration flexible connectors based on the optimum stiffness configuration and rigid hinge connectors are investigated respectively fig 8 gives the information about maximal connection loads as shown in fig 8 a to c it is obvious to see that compared with the rigid hinge connection the optimum stiffness configuration contributes to reduce the loads on flexible connectors largely especially at 85 to be more specific the maximal longitudinal load on flexible connectors is decreased most obviously with a distinct difference of two orders of magnitude and meanwhile the maximal transversal and vertical loads are also reduced by 17 and 68 respectively fig 9 illustrates a comparison of maximal module responses as observed in fig 9 f although the maximal yaw motion of the system with flexible connectors is larger than that of the system with rigid hinge connectors its value is small posing a negligible influence for the motions in other degrees of freedom shown in fig 9 a to e the optimum stiffness configuration doesn t cause a great difference compared with rigid hinge connectors in most occasions but brings about an obvious reduction for heave and pitch motion at 85 to summarize the stiffness configuration of connectors with small longitudinal stiffness and large transversal and vertical stiffness is favorable for most wave conditions the approach developed in this paper is general and capable to handle many influential factors into considerations optimal result is subject to preferences on special requirements with this developed approach it becomes easy to resolve an optimal stiffness configuration for flexible connectors 5 conclusions this paper presents a general strategy for the determination of the stiffness configuration for flexible connectors according to specific requirements based on the rfmc and linear spring model a ga based routine procedure is proposed to find an optimal stiffness configuration of flexible connectors subject to requirements tolerances and constraints the decision process involves many influential factors and the weight distribution for objective functions is introduced for the optimization process the guideline for the weight assignment is elaborated in conjunction with preference on specific concerns in engineering applications a full scenario of weight combination is investigated and the stiffness configuration for flexible connectors is found by using the multi layer optimization model the resultant solution indicates that the stiffness combination of small longitudinal stiffness large transversal and large vertical stiffness is most favorable however in the present optimization strategy the connector is simplified with the ignorance of torsion bending stiffness and nonlinear character is not considered in the future work a more comprehensive connector model and nonlinear character will be taken into consideration to improve the procedure regardless of these the optimization strategy is still effectual which develops a general and systematic tool to determine the connector stiffness among tremendous influential factors is important for real applications of modularized vlfs acknowledgement this research work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no
