bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid production through different light intensities dark 800 lx 3 200 lx 5 670 lx and 8 000 lx were verified the cultures were inoculated in 250 ml erlenmeyer and operated under anaerobic conditions for 192 h rcv medium with hexavalent chromium 10 mg l 30 mg l 60 mg l 90 mg l and 110 mg l was used the findings show there was complete removal of hexavalent chromium the increase in light intensity reduced the time for removal concerning total chromium maximum removal occurred under 5 670 lx at low initial concentrations of hexavalent chromium of 10 mg l 80 2 30 mg l 89 3 and 60 mg l 77 0 furthermore the increase in light intensity up to 5 670 lx favored cell growth and pigment production at 5 670 lx there was a 230 increase in biomass content in the culture with an initial concentration of 60 mg l of hexavalent chromium the final pigment contents were 2 22 mg m3 bacteriochlorophyll and 1 44 mg m3 carotenoid graphical abstract unlabelled image

pollution with heavy metals is a concern associated with the devastating effects on human health and the environment 1 3 heavy metals characterized by their non degradable nature and toxicity are a significant threat to living beings 4 chromium is considered one of the most toxic heavy metals being one of the most common environmental pollutants due to its large utility in the industry 5 it can be released from natural sources especially from the earth s crust 6 however chromium vi is most commonly produced by industrial processing and chemical products manufacturing metallurgy leather tanning electroplating and textile dyeing 7 8 stand out as a result most of these industries generate large amounts of effluent that are often released directly into water bodies or the soil without treatment causing severe pollution chromium is the only element among the toxic components regulated in the environment presenting different species specifically trivalent chromium and hexavalent chromium 9 trivalent chromium plays a vital role in glucose protein and fat metabolisms it is insoluble and interconnected to organic matter 10 11 in contrast to trivalent chromium hexavalent chromium is very soluble mobile and has high toxic implications that cause harmful impacts on animals and humans 7 long term exposure to hexavalent chromium acts as a mutagenic teratogenic and carcinogenic substance 12 different strategies are adopted for chromium detoxification including physical and chemical methods the chemical precipitation and redox reactions could also be used 13 however both are often expensive and generate several toxic by products 14 therefore it is essential to seek alternative and cost effective techniques for chromium remediation 8 the biological method bioremediation stands out as a strategy that uses living organisms such as bacteria fungi algae yeasts and plants to restore the environment to its original state 15 the bioremediation process includes biosorption bioaccumulation and biotransformation mechanisms for pollutant detoxification 16 bioremediation is a natural process and is therefore an acceptable waste treatment process for contaminated material on the other hand bioremediation is recommended since join forces with the sustainable development goals from united nations such as 6 clean water and sanitation microbes are able to degrade contaminants increasing in number when the contaminant is degraded the biodegradative population declines the residues are usually harmless and include carbon dioxide water and cell biomass in addition the bioremediation often takes longer than physicochemical remediation techniques the bioremediation technique is indicated for low metal concentrations below 100 mg l 17 19 and usually lasts for seven days or more 20 moreover essential factors for microbial culture development mainly the phototrophic bacterial system such as purple non sulfur pns bacteria must be considered the light intensity is a relevant factor interfering in biomass and pigments bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids production 21 photosynthetic bacteria have been used for simultaneously removing pollutants and recovering resources for example in the treatment of effluents containing cadmium food wastewater domestic wastewater and others 22 25 in addition pns bacteria are capable to modify their metabolic strategies depending on the different energy sources and demonstrate high adaptability under environmental pressures 26 among several photosynthetic bacteria rhodobacter capsulatus stands out which showed a strong capacity for au3 biosorption 27 magnin et al 28 investigated the zinc biosorption capacity of the purple non sulfur bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus b10 in the wild type strain and the strain without the presence of the endogenous plasmid in the absence of the endogenous plasmid there was a decrease in zinc uptake for an initial concentration greater than 100 mg l suggesting that it may be a function of cell surface changes affecting zinc binding bacteria belonging to the rhodobacter group have a versatile metabolism in addition to being able to grow under anaerobic and aerobic conditions the gram negative bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus is optionally phototrophic capable of producing cellular energy in several different ways and may depend on anoxygenic photosynthesis under anaerobic conditions in the presence of light 29 the main challenge to be overcome is the capacity that the microorganism presents for the reduction of cr vi to cr iii this kind of skill can be observed in the rhodobacter group it makes it potentially favorable for wastewater bioremediation by photofermentation the current work aimed to contribute to a greater understanding of the bioremediation process of chromium by photosynthetic bacteria specifically r capsulatus exploiting light intensity mechanisms however it is worth noting that the main objective was to evaluate the bacterial efficiency in removing the pollutant the novelty is related to phototrophic bacteria use that provides an attractive alternative for wastewater treatment a few recurrent in previous investigations therefore the effect of light intensity on the chromium removal cell growth and pigment production was also verified 2 material and methods 2 1 rhodobacter capsulatus the purple non sulfur bacterium pnsb rhodobacter capsulatus dsm 1710 was purchased from the leibniz institute dsmz german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures r capsulatus was maintained in basal rcv rhodobacter capsulatus v medium 30 with an initial ph of 6 8 and incubated in a chamber at 30 c under continuous brightness 2 200 lx the anaerobic condition was obtained through the injection of argon gas 99 99 for 3 min within 10 days the bacterial culture was centrifuged 8 000 rpm 15 min and the sediment was resuspended in a fresh medium under anaerobiosis 2 2 assay conditions bacterial biomass was cultivated in a bioreactor 250 ml erlenmeyer previously sterilized and sealed containing the basal rcv medium with chromium vi with an initial ph of 6 8 the source of hexavalent chromium was potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 different initial concentrations of chromium 10 mg l 30 mg l 60 mg l 90 mg l and 110 mg l were used the anaerobic condition was maintained by injecting argon gas 99 99 for 3 min bioreactors were placed in a chamber at room temperature under continuous lighting provided by white light with dimmable light emitting diodes led lamps several luminous intensities 800 lx 3 200 lx 5 670 lx and 8 000 lx were used the physical condition of the absence of light was also verified for that the bioreactor was wrapped with brown paper the experiment was carried on in duplicate with a time fermentation of eight days therefore the reduction of hexavalent chromium under different light intensities including in the absence of light was verified finally control conditions were performed using 1 the culture medium without bacteria and 2 r capsulatus in rcv medium without chromium 2 3 analytical methods the cell density gvs l was determined by spectrophotometry and the optical density at 650 nm od650 was converted to gsv l by a predetermined correlation equation between od650 and grams of volatile solids per liter 31 the hexavalent chromium concentration was determined by the colorimetric method using the diphenylcarbazide reagent by spectrometry rochester ny usa genesys 10 uv with absorbance reading at 540 nm according to the american public health association apha methodology 32 the total chromium concentration was determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry shimadzu brand model aa 7000 the chromium removal efficiency both hexavalent and total was calculated from eq 1 1 ŋ t c 0 c t c 0 100 where ŋt is the chromium removal efficiency at time t c 0 and c t correspond to the concentrations of hexavalent chromium and total chromium mg l at the initial time and at time t respectively cell disruption for the bacteriochlorophyll content quantification was performed using the modified method of jeffrey and humphrey 33 a 20 ml suspension of cells was collected and centrifuged at 8 000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was discarded the pellet was resuspended in a 10 ml acetone methanol 7 2 v v solution cell disruption was performed using a vortex mixer for 40 min using glass spheres with a diameter between 0 6 mm and 0 8 mm for each milliliter of cell suspension an ice bath 2 min was used every 5 min under vortexing agitation to keep the solution at low temperatures the extract obtained was centrifuged 8000 rpm 10 min after centrifugation the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 771 nm the bacteriochlorophyll content mg l was calculated according to eq 2 2 bacteriochlorophyll content mg l a 771 x v 1 x n 760 x v 2 where a771 corresponds to the absorbance of the extract at 771 nm v1 is the volume of the extract obtained n comprises the dilution ratio v2 is the volume of the initial sample and 760 represents the extinction coefficient of bacteriochlorophyll 34 the results were converted to mg m3 carotenoids were determined by a suspension of 20 ml of cells collected and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 20 min the supernatant was discarded the sediment was washed twice with distilled water after washing cells were dried at 65 c until reaching constant weight for cell disruption 10 ml of an hcl solution 3 m at 28 c was added to the cells dried under stirring at 100 rpm for 1 5 h and again centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 20 min the supernatant was discarded subsequently acetone 10 ml was added the extraction of carotenoids was performed by stirring at 100 rpm for 30 min at 28 c 35 the carotenoid extract was obtained by centrifugation 10 000 rpm 20 min its quantification was accomplished by a spectrophotometer rochester ny usa genesys 10 uv at 473 nm the carotenoid content mg l was calculated according to eq 3 3 carotenoid content mg l a 473 x v 3 x n x 10 2500 x v 4 where a473 comprises the absorbance of the diluted extract solution at 473 nm and v3 is the volume of the extract obtained n is the dilution ratio v4 corresponds to initial sample volume and 2500 represents the extinction coefficient of the carotenoid 34 the findings were converted to mg m3 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of light intensity and hexavalent chromium on the bacterial growth in the first step the growth of r capsulatus was accomplished fig 1 the influence of light intensity from 0 to 8 000 lx and hexavalent chromium concentration from 0 to 110 mg l on the pns bacterium culture was verified in general not only the stress condition provided by the presence of hexavalent chromium but also the absence of light interferes with the cell growth kinetics regarding the absence of light the cell density varied from 0 63 g l to 0 71 g l for all conditions evaluated suggesting that the cell growth was slow in the dark kuo et al 36 investigated the effects of different light sources on the growth of photosynthetic bacteria rhodopseudomonas palustris the cell growth was slower in the dark than when subjected to lighting in the dark the biomass reached 0 75 106 cells ml under light conditions 4 9 106 cells ml were verified the same behavior was reported by siefert et al 37 who demonstrated that rhodobacter capsulate grows greater under light than under dark conditions the increase in light intensity favored increments in biomass for the control conditions as well as lower initial concentrations of the heavy metal of 10 mg l 30 mg l and 60 mg l other studies reported that increasing the light intensity from 2 000 lx to 4 000 lx showed increments in the growth of photosynthetic bacteria 38 39 zhou et al 40 observed that biomass production was improved at light intensities of 1 000 lx to 4 000 lx compared to the low light intensity condition of 500 lx using a rhodopseudomonas photosynthetic bacterium strain these authors verified that the biomass production reached 2 645 mg l 100 mg l initial density under a light intensity of 2 000 lx in contrast basak and das 41 reported that the biomass of r sphaeroides did not increase when the light intensity reached values above 3 000 lx the light conversion efficiency varies from microorganism to microorganism however when the light intensity exceeded 5 000 lx a decrease in cell growth was observed therefore it is suggested that at a given cell concentration and light intensity light becomes a limiting factor for cell growth this factor can be explained by the self shading and light absorption by cells close to the illumination surface 42 comparing current work that evaluated the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus from an initial cell concentration of 0 5 g l the optimal condition of 5 670 lx was identified the biomass density reached final cell densities of 1 55 g l 1 59 g l and 1 65 g l for conditions of 10 mg l 30 mg l and 60 mg l of cr vi respectively however when increasing the light intensity from 5 670 lx to 8 000 lx the biomass density did not increase remaining constant in addition microorganisms use metals as a nutrient or energy source for their growth 43 since cell densities in the presence of 10 mg l 30 mg l and 60 mg l of cr vi were higher than in the control condition without chromium besides the microorganism can grow in environments containing cr vi depending on the responses of antioxidant enzymes 44 during the cr vi reduction process bacterial cells are subjected to oxidative stress resulting in the simultaneous generation of reactive oxygen species ros 45 however the cellular antioxidant defense system reduces the oxidative damage by eliminating ros 46 according to lazarova et al 47 the generation of ros increased due to the higher concentration of cr vi many studies link the toxicity and carcinogenicity of cr vi to excessive production of ros and the corresponding oxidative stress causing deoxyribonucleic acid dna damage 48 50 in addition it affects cell viability and cr vi reduction efficiency 45 ros causes lipid damage consequently altering the fluidity of the cell membrane also it inactivates membrane proteins 51 in conditions with high initial concentrations of hexavalent chromium 90 mg l and 110 mg l the biomass growth was lower compared to the control condition and the other conditions with lower concentrations of cr vi 10 mg l 30 mg l and 60 mg l between 0 and 3 200 lx the biomass content increased with increasing light intensity thereby the ideal light intensity that favored the increase in cell density was 3 200 lx reaching final cell densities of 0 85 g l and 0 77 g l in conditions of 90 mg l and 110 mg l of cr vi respectively while for high light intensities of 5 670 lx and 8 000 lx there was a decrease in biomass density it suggests that chromium impairs the multiplication of bacteria 52 and still interferes with the metabolic activity of cells increasingly disturbing oxidative balance 44 according to studies by gupta et al 53 malondialdehyde mda content and ros level in klebsiella sp and enterobacter sp resulted in a significant increase in the size of the cell when exposed to cr vi stress in addition the balance was disturbed between the production of antioxidant enzymes and the level of ros causing cell damage and death this fact can be proven in the work developed by hu et al 54 in which the growth of a indicus yy 1 was inhibited by being subjected to an initial concentration of cr vi of 80 mg l the stress caused by the high concentration of cr vi is greater than the contribution of energy provided by light to bacterial growth 3 2 removal of hexavalent and total chromium by rhodobacter capsulatus to evaluate the tolerance of the bacterial strain r capsulatus in the removal of chromium different initial concentrations of hexavalent chromium solutions were added to bacterial cultures according to table 1 all conditions evaluated resulted in the complete removal of chromium hexavalent the increase in luminosity 5 670 lx and 8 000 lx favors the removal and the total cr removal was verified in a short period in addition high concentrations of hexavalent chromium require a longer reaction time to achieve the same removal efficiency for a lower initial chromium concentration 55 these facts comply with the results presented for conditions of low cr vi concentrations of 10 mg l and 30 mg l the total removal occurred in 30 min for all ranges of light intensity evaluated it suggests low concentrations of cr vi do not interfere with metabolic activities but the total removal was not verified table 2 on the other hand the effect of luminosity is highlighted maximum chromium removal was reached at 5 670 lx being 80 15 89 31 and 76 99 for conditions of 10 mg l 30 mg l and 60 mg l of cr vi respectively while in the absence of light the lowest total chromium removal rates were verified for all initial concentrations of cr vi evaluated it suggests the dark impairs the metabolic mechanism therefore the bioremediation process is energy dependent being stimulated by light as reported by gorbi et al 56 who evaluated the effect of light on chromium toxicity in single celled freshwater algae strain scenedesmus acutus in which chromium absorption occurred slowly when subjected to weak light furthermore the uptake of metals is a dependent metabolic mechanism since it occurs only in living cells in addition to requiring energy to transport cr vi to cells 44 in conditions of high cr vi concentrations 90 mg l and 110 mg l the increase in light intensity did not result in increments in the efficiency of total chromium removal the authors verified the lowest total chromium removal and the lowest cell density in high concentrations of cr vi the chromium removal capacity decreased with the increase of the initial concentration of chromium according to the studies by sun et al 55 enterobacter sp grown in an anaerobic reactor with residual molasses as a carbon source for the cr vi reduction process these authors observed the cr vi removal decreased as the cr vi concentration increased an initial concentration of cr vi of 30 mg l presented 88 80 of chromium removal after 18 h in reactors with concentrations greater than 100 mg l a longer reaction time was required to achieve the same percentage of removal furthermore if the concentration of cr vi is high the result is inhibition of bacterial growth and activity thus affecting the bacterial reduction of cr vi likewise in the work developed by hu et al 54 the results also prove that increasing the concentration of cr vi reduced the removal of cr vi from a indicus yy 1 for an initial concentration of cr vi of 20 mg l a removal efficiency of 93 52 was achieved while for an initial concentration of cr vi of 80 mg l the removal efficiency was only 15 16 another factor that should be mentioned is that the chromium reduction time increases with increasing chromium concentration due to the saturation of the reductase enzyme responsible for chromium reduction 57 different chromate reductases chrr yief nema and lpdh present in the cytoplasmic fraction soluble or bound to the membrane have been reported to catalyze the reaction under aerobic or anaerobic conditions or both soluble reductases participate in the extracellular or intracellular reduction of cr vi 58 however membrane associated reductase shows extracellular reduction 59 as an example of enzymes of an extracellular nature priester et al 60 reported the cytoplasm originated chromate reductases that reduced cr vi extracellularly in p putida regarding intracellular reduction cr vi is reduced in the cytosol by cytoplasmic soluble reductase enzymes as an example of bacteria that reduce cr vi extracellularly the following stand out p aeruginosa pseudomonas sp rhodobacter sphaeroides 45 in the process of reducing hexavalent chromium 44 to trivalent chromium the enzyme reductase produced by cells directs this reduction by direct and indirect means functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and amino present on the cell surface of bacteria bind to hexavalent chromium or trivalent chromium to form complexes reduced trivalent chromium accumulates intracellularly the serratia sp c8 isolated from tannery effluents can reduce cr vi to cr iii by intracellular reductase in addition cr iii accumulated in the cell it is common knowledge bacillus tcl strain has an exopolysaccharide the structure can combine with cr iii and form an extracellular exopolysaccharide complex 61 after a short time the total chromium corresponds to trivalent chromium the trivalent chromium after the reduction has several paths for example it can bind with the anions present in the medium to form precipitates complexes and others also it was accumulated intracellularly or extracellularly the cell membrane can form a complex to inhibit the entry of the metal into the cell 44 heavy metal resistance mechanism in bacteria can be verified for example using the metal in small amounts destined for their metabolic activities offering resistance at levels of toxic substances detoxifying excess metal 62 it is also relevant to discuss the results obtained from the control assays the control assays were based on the evaluation of light on chromium removal in these experiments there was no presence of bacterial biomass fig 2 shows the variation in the results in relation to the concentration of hexavalent chromium and total chromium at the same time intervals respectively hexavalent chromium and total chromium concentrations did not modify thus it is possible to conclude that only the light intensity does not interfere in chromium reduction in addition figs 3 and 4 illustrates bioremediation process evolution within certain hours of interval 3 3 bacteriochlorophyll and total carotenoids production bacterial biomass is rich in protein carotenoids bacteriochlorophyll biopolymers antimicrobial agents and pantothenic acid 36 among these several components bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid pigments stand out due to their application as food coloring vitamin a and precursors in food and animal feed 63 64 these pigments are considered light collectors in photosynthetic bacteria 65 they provide the capture and transferring light energy in chemical energy for the cell growth fig 5 represents the bacteriochlorophyll content at the beginning and the end in the absence of luminosity the lowest content of bacteriochlorophyll was observed regarding the content of carotenoids in fig 6 there was no production of carotenoids in the absence of light some studies have shown that photo pigment synthesis in algae did not occur under conditions of total darkness 66 the bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids content increased with increments in light intensity especially when comparing the results obtained at 800 lx to 5 670 lx for conditions of lower initial concentrations of hexavalent cr of 10 mg l 30 mg l and 60 mg l and control conditions the maximum concentrations of bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids were 2 22 mg m3 and 1 47 mg m3 respectively for the culture condition with 60 mg l cr vi under a light intensity of 5 670 lx the presence of light favors the synthesis of bacteriochlorophyll photosynthetic pigments or light gathering complexes absorb much of the light energy both are present in cells and bind to protein components of the photosynthetic system in the cell membrane 36 the carotenoid represents an oxidant acting as a light gathering pigment in photosynthetic microorganisms 65 schagerl and muller 67 showed the carotenoid pigment as a light collector when exposed to weak light in addition it played an important role in photoprotection when submitted to intense luminosity zhou et al 40 investigated the production of pigments bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids in wastewater treatment by rhodopseudomonas bacterium these authors observed that the carotenoid content decreased with increasing light intensity between 500 lx and 2 000 lx in addition the production of carotenoids was lower at 2 000 lx while in the range of 2 000 lx to 8 000 lx carotenoid content increased with increments in the light intensity reaching 1 45 mg l also the bacteriochlorophyll content decreased with increments in the light intensity from 500 lx to 2 000 lx however in the range of 2 000 lx to 8 000 lx the bacteriochlorophyll content increased with increments in the light intensity it has been reported that high light intensity can stimulate bacteriochlorophyll production for growth increases in the bacteriochlorophyll content may also be associated with increases in biomass which is also influenced by light intensity also at 800 lx and 3 200 lx increases in pigment content bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids were observed under conditions of initial concentrations of cr vi of 60 mg l 90 mg l and 110 mg l than compared to the lowest chromium contents 10 mg l and 30 mg l the highest bacteriochlorophyll content was 1 60 mg m3 110 mg l cr vi and 3 200 lx in addition 1 18 mg m3 of carotenoid content was reached for 60 mg l and 90 mg l of cr vi the phenomenon is explained through the mechanisms adopted by the microorganism s metabolism to overcome the oxidative stress caused by chromium in addition the increased production of pigments and the release of substances into the environment can reduce the toxicity of the metal 69 to synthetic medium with low initial concentrations of cr vi 10 mg l and 30 mg l low production of pigments was observed for these conditions of low light intensity an explanation may be related to metabolism biomass density is increased as well as removing chromium in contrast pigment production is not privileged in addition increments in light intensity did not contribute with the production of pigments bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids for the conditions of high cr concentrations vi of 90 mg l and 110 mg l since in these conditions the oxidative stress caused by chromium and the effect of excessive light intensity is considered a limiting factor for cell growth and pigment synthesis however 3 200 lx is the ideal light intensity for the production of biomass and pigments bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids finally the concentration of bacteriochlorophyll was higher than the carotenoids probably light stimulated the synthesis of bacteriochlorophyll in its excitation states and did not significantly contribute to the biological synthesis of carotenoids however the behavior is specific to the photosynthetic bacterium r capsulatus to better understand the influence of light intensity the consolidated findings obtained concerning maximum cell density pigment contents and chromium removal are shown table 3 from the results presented in table 3 at the light intensity of 5 670 lx the highest total chromium removals were obtained for the conditions of initial hexavalent chromium concentrations of 10 mg l 30 mg l and 60 mg l high biomass densities and pigment content were also verified finally the total chromium removal occurs in a shorter time wang et al 34 investigated the viability of the bacterial strain shewanella loihica pv 4 in the chromium reduction process these authors verified the presence of a different source of organic carbon removal of 91 2 of hexavalent chromium after 27 days hexavalent chromium 52 2 mg l and citrate as a carbon source were used hu et al 69 explored ph conditions in the bioremediation of aquifers contaminated with hexavalent chromium complete removal of contaminants was observed at an initial ph of 10 0 and 11 0 using an initial concentration of hexavalent chromium of 10 mg l through a microbial community for the other ph conditions 5 0 7 0 and 12 0 the removal ranged from 10 to 30 table 4 presented a brief comparison concerning cr vi removal by bacterial strains the findings showed different performance at diverse strains in comparison with r capsulatus such as p pabuli 1 28 fold higher b cereus 1 04 fold lower b subtilis mnu16 1 04 fold lower and s oneidensis mr 1 1 12 fold higher it s important to note the similar toxic original used however similar responses were provided by bacterial cultures in conclusion r capsulatus is resistant to cr vi this might be a good basis for use in bioremediation experiments indicated that r capsulatus has the same potential for chromium removal as others it is worth noting that although there is variability or even genetic manipulation the higher potential of the pns investigated in the current work stands out 4 conclusion the current work demonstrated that rhodobacter capsulatus was able to produce biomass bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids in a toxic medium with the presence of chromium in general in the first 12 h the time interval in which the process of reduction of hexavalent chromium to trivalent chromium occurs there was a slight cell growth therefore the metabolism was directed toward the bioreduction process the increase in light intensity contributed to increasing biomass and total chromium removal 80 2 10 mgcrvi l 89 3 30 mgcrvi l and 77 0 60 mgcrvi l also the production of bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids to 10 mg l 30 mg l and 60 mg l cr vi at 5 670 lx was observed however under high concentrations of hexavalent cr 90 mg l e 110 mg l cell growth inhibition was verified and slow efficiency in removing chromium in addition to overcome the oxidative stress caused by chromium the strategy adopted by the microorganism was to increase the production of pigments carotenoids their production was disadvantaged by the lack of light finally the practical implication should be considering ex situ bioremediation less labor intensive cheap eco friendly sustainable and relatively easy to implement besides in general the removal process quickly reaches a plateau and the treatment was favorable despite the high concentration of biomass formed declaration of competing interest the

pollution with heavy metals is a concern associated with the devastating effects on human health and the environment 1 3 heavy metals characterized by their non degradable nature and toxicity are a significant threat to living beings 4 chromium is considered one of the most toxic heavy metals being one of the most common environmental pollutants due to its large utility in the industry 5 it can be released from natural sources especially from the earth s crust 6 however chromium vi is most commonly produced by industrial processing and chemical products manufacturing metallurgy leather tanning electroplating and textile dyeing 7 8 stand out as a result most of these industries generate large amounts of effluent that are often released directly into water bodies or the soil without treatment causing severe pollution chromium is the only element among the toxic components regulated in the environment presenting different species specifically trivalent chromium and hexavalent chromium 9 trivalent chromium plays a vital role in glucose protein and fat metabolisms it is insoluble and interconnected to organic matter 10 11 in contrast to trivalent chromium hexavalent chromium is very soluble mobile and has high toxic implications that cause harmful impacts on animals and humans 7 long term exposure to hexavalent chromium acts as a mutagenic teratogenic and carcinogenic substance 12 different strategies are adopted for chromium detoxification including physical and chemical methods the chemical precipitation and redox reactions could also be used 13 however both are often expensive and generate several toxic by products 14 therefore it is essential to seek alternative and cost effective techniques for chromium remediation 8 the biological method bioremediation stands out as a strategy that uses living organisms such as bacteria fungi algae yeasts and plants to restore the environment to its original state 15 the bioremediation process includes biosorption bioaccumulation and biotransformation mechanisms for pollutant detoxification 16 bioremediation is a natural process and is therefore an acceptable waste treatment process for contaminated material on the other hand bioremediation is recommended since join forces with the sustainable development goals from united nations such as 6 clean water and sanitation microbes are able to degrade contaminants increasing in number when the contaminant is degraded the biodegradative population declines the residues are usually harmless and include carbon dioxide water and cell biomass in addition the bioremediation often takes longer than physicochemical remediation techniques the bioremediation technique is indicated for low metal concentrations below 100 mg l 17 19 and usually lasts for seven days or more 20 moreover essential factors for microbial culture development mainly the phototrophic bacterial system such as purple non sulfur pns bacteria must be considered the light intensity is a relevant factor interfering in biomass and pigments bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids production 21 photosynthetic bacteria have been used for simultaneously removing pollutants and recovering resources for example in the treatment of effluents containing cadmium food wastewater domestic wastewater and others 22 25 in addition pns bacteria are capable to modify their metabolic strategies depending on the different energy sources and demonstrate high adaptability under environmental pressures 26 among several photosynthetic bacteria rhodobacter capsulatus stands out which showed a strong capacity for au3 biosorption 27 magnin et al 28 investigated the zinc biosorption capacity of the purple non sulfur bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus b10 in the wild type strain and the strain without the presence of the endogenous plasmid in the absence of the endogenous plasmid there was a decrease in zinc uptake for an initial concentration greater than 100 mg l suggesting that it may be a function of cell surface changes affecting zinc binding bacteria belonging to the rhodobacter group have a versatile metabolism in addition to being able to grow under anaerobic and aerobic conditions the gram negative bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus is optionally phototrophic capable of producing cellular energy in several different ways and may depend on anoxygenic photosynthesis under anaerobic conditions in the presence of light 29 the main challenge to be overcome is the capacity that the microorganism presents for the reduction of cr vi to cr iii this kind of skill can be observed in the rhodobacter group it makes it potentially favorable for wastewater bioremediation by photofermentation the current work aimed to contribute to a greater understanding of the bioremediation process of chromium by photosynthetic bacteria specifically r capsulatus exploiting light intensity mechanisms however it is worth noting that the main objective was to evaluate the bacterial efficiency in removing the pollutant the novelty is related to phototrophic bacteria use that provides an attractive alternative for wastewater treatment a few recurrent in previous investigations therefore the effect of light intensity on the chromium removal cell growth and pigment production was also verified 2 material and methods 2 1 rhodobacter capsulatus the purple non sulfur bacterium pnsb rhodobacter capsulatus dsm 1710 was purchased from the leibniz institute dsmz german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures r capsulatus was maintained in basal rcv rhodobacter capsulatus v medium 30 with an initial ph of 6 8 and incubated in a chamber at 30 c under continuous brightness 2 200 lx the anaerobic condition was obtained through the injection of argon gas 99 99 for 3 min within 10 days the bacterial culture was centrifuged 8 000 rpm 15 min and the sediment was resuspended in a fresh medium under anaerobiosis 2 2 assay conditions bacterial biomass was cultivated in a bioreactor 250 ml erlenmeyer previously sterilized and sealed containing the basal rcv medium with chromium vi with an initial ph of 6 8 the source of hexavalent chromium was potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 different initial concentrations of chromium 10 mg l 30 mg l 60 mg l 90 mg l and 110 mg l were used the anaerobic condition was maintained by injecting argon gas 99 99 for 3 min bioreactors were placed in a chamber at room temperature under continuous lighting provided by white light with dimmable light emitting diodes led lamps several luminous intensities 800 lx 3 200 lx 5 670 lx and 8 000 lx were used the physical condition of the absence of light was also verified for that the bioreactor was wrapped with brown paper the experiment was carried on in duplicate with a time fermentation of eight days therefore the reduction of hexavalent chromium under different light intensities including in the absence of light was verified finally control conditions were performed using 1 the culture medium without bacteria and 2 r capsulatus in rcv medium without chromium 2 3 analytical methods the cell density gvs l was determined by spectrophotometry and the optical density at 650 nm od650 was converted to gsv l by a predetermined correlation equation between od650 and grams of volatile solids per liter 31 the hexavalent chromium concentration was determined by the colorimetric method using the diphenylcarbazide reagent by spectrometry rochester ny usa genesys 10 uv with absorbance reading at 540 nm according to the american public health association apha methodology 32 the total chromium concentration was determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry shimadzu brand model aa 7000 the chromium removal efficiency both hexavalent and total was calculated from eq 1 1 ŋ t c 0 c t c 0 100 where ŋt is the chromium removal efficiency at time t c 0 and c t correspond to the concentrations of hexavalent chromium and total chromium mg l at the initial time and at time t respectively cell disruption for the bacteriochlorophyll content quantification was performed using the modified method of jeffrey and humphrey 33 a 20 ml suspension of cells was collected and centrifuged at 8 000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was discarded the pellet was resuspended in a 10 ml acetone methanol 7 2 v v solution cell disruption was performed using a vortex mixer for 40 min using glass spheres with a diameter between 0 6 mm and 0 8 mm for each milliliter of cell suspension an ice bath 2 min was used every 5 min under vortexing agitation to keep the solution at low temperatures the extract obtained was centrifuged 8000 rpm 10 min after centrifugation the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 771 nm the bacteriochlorophyll content mg l was calculated according to eq 2 2 bacteriochlorophyll content mg l a 771 x v 1 x n 760 x v 2 where a771 corresponds to the absorbance of the extract at 771 nm v1 is the volume of the extract obtained n comprises the dilution ratio v2 is the volume of the initial sample and 760 represents the extinction coefficient of bacteriochlorophyll 34 the results were converted to mg m3 carotenoids were determined by a suspension of 20 ml of cells collected and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 20 min the supernatant was discarded the sediment was washed twice with distilled water after washing cells were dried at 65 c until reaching constant weight for cell disruption 10 ml of an hcl solution 3 m at 28 c was added to the cells dried under stirring at 100 rpm for 1 5 h and again centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 20 min the supernatant was discarded subsequently acetone 10 ml was added the extraction of carotenoids was performed by stirring at 100 rpm for 30 min at 28 c 35 the carotenoid extract was obtained by centrifugation 10 000 rpm 20 min its quantification was accomplished by a spectrophotometer rochester ny usa genesys 10 uv at 473 nm the carotenoid content mg l was calculated according to eq 3 3 carotenoid content mg l a 473 x v 3 x n x 10 2500 x v 4 where a473 comprises the absorbance of the diluted extract solution at 473 nm and v3 is the volume of the extract obtained n is the dilution ratio v4 corresponds to initial sample volume and 2500 represents the extinction coefficient of the carotenoid 34 the findings were converted to mg m3 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of light intensity and hexavalent chromium on the bacterial growth in the first step the growth of r capsulatus was accomplished fig 1 the influence of light intensity from 0 to 8 000 lx and hexavalent chromium concentration from 0 to 110 mg l on the pns bacterium culture was verified in general not only the stress condition provided by the presence of hexavalent chromium but also the absence of light interferes with the cell growth kinetics regarding the absence of light the cell density varied from 0 63 g l to 0 71 g l for all conditions evaluated suggesting that the cell growth was slow in the dark kuo et al 36 investigated the effects of different light sources on the growth of photosynthetic bacteria rhodopseudomonas palustris the cell growth was slower in the dark than when subjected to lighting in the dark the biomass reached 0 75 106 cells ml under light conditions 4 9 106 cells ml were verified the same behavior was reported by siefert et al 37 who demonstrated that rhodobacter capsulate grows greater under light than under dark conditions the increase in light intensity favored increments in biomass for the control conditions as well as lower initial concentrations of the heavy metal of 10 mg l 30 mg l and 60 mg l other studies reported that increasing the light intensity from 2 000 lx to 4 000 lx showed increments in the growth of photosynthetic bacteria 38 39 zhou et al 40 observed that biomass production was improved at light intensities of 1 000 lx to 4 000 lx compared to the low light intensity condition of 500 lx using a rhodopseudomonas photosynthetic bacterium strain these authors verified that the biomass production reached 2 645 mg l 100 mg l initial density under a light intensity of 2 000 lx in contrast basak and das 41 reported that the biomass of r sphaeroides did not increase when the light intensity reached values above 3 000 lx the light conversion efficiency varies from microorganism to microorganism however when the light intensity exceeded 5 000 lx a decrease in cell growth was observed therefore it is suggested that at a given cell concentration and light intensity light becomes a limiting factor for cell growth this factor can be explained by the self shading and light absorption by cells close to the illumination surface 42 comparing current work that evaluated the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus from an initial cell concentration of 0 5 g l the optimal condition of 5 670 lx was identified the biomass density reached final cell densities of 1 55 g l 1 59 g l and 1 65 g l for conditions of 10 mg l 30 mg l and 60 mg l of cr vi respectively however when increasing the light intensity from 5 670 lx to 8 000 lx the biomass density did not increase remaining constant in addition microorganisms use metals as a nutrient or energy source for their growth 43 since cell densities in the presence of 10 mg l 30 mg l and 60 mg l of cr vi were higher than in the control condition without chromium besides the microorganism can grow in environments containing cr vi depending on the responses of antioxidant enzymes 44 during the cr vi reduction process bacterial cells are subjected to oxidative stress resulting in the simultaneous generation of reactive oxygen species ros 45 however the cellular antioxidant defense system reduces the oxidative damage by eliminating ros 46 according to lazarova et al 47 the generation of ros increased due to the higher concentration of cr vi many studies link the toxicity and carcinogenicity of cr vi to excessive production of ros and the corresponding oxidative stress causing deoxyribonucleic acid dna damage 48 50 in addition it affects cell viability and cr vi reduction efficiency 45 ros causes lipid damage consequently altering the fluidity of the cell membrane also it inactivates membrane proteins 51 in conditions with high initial concentrations of hexavalent chromium 90 mg l and 110 mg l the biomass growth was lower compared to the control condition and the other conditions with lower concentrations of cr vi 10 mg l 30 mg l and 60 mg l between 0 and 3 200 lx the biomass content increased with increasing light intensity thereby the ideal light intensity that favored the increase in cell density was 3 200 lx reaching final cell densities of 0 85 g l and 0 77 g l in conditions of 90 mg l and 110 mg l of cr vi respectively while for high light intensities of 5 670 lx and 8 000 lx there was a decrease in biomass density it suggests that chromium impairs the multiplication of bacteria 52 and still interferes with the metabolic activity of cells increasingly disturbing oxidative balance 44 according to studies by gupta et al 53 malondialdehyde mda content and ros level in klebsiella sp and enterobacter sp resulted in a significant increase in the size of the cell when exposed to cr vi stress in addition the balance was disturbed between the production of antioxidant enzymes and the level of ros causing cell damage and death this fact can be proven in the work developed by hu et al 54 in which the growth of a indicus yy 1 was inhibited by being subjected to an initial concentration of cr vi of 80 mg l the stress caused by the high concentration of cr vi is greater than the contribution of energy provided by light to bacterial growth 3 2 removal of hexavalent and total chromium by rhodobacter capsulatus to evaluate the tolerance of the bacterial strain r capsulatus in the removal of chromium different initial concentrations of hexavalent chromium solutions were added to bacterial cultures according to table 1 all conditions evaluated resulted in the complete removal of chromium hexavalent the increase in luminosity 5 670 lx and 8 000 lx favors the removal and the total cr removal was verified in a short period in addition high concentrations of hexavalent chromium require a longer reaction time to achieve the same removal efficiency for a lower initial chromium concentration 55 these facts comply with the results presented for conditions of low cr vi concentrations of 10 mg l and 30 mg l the total removal occurred in 30 min for all ranges of light intensity evaluated it suggests low concentrations of cr vi do not interfere with metabolic activities but the total removal was not verified table 2 on the other hand the effect of luminosity is highlighted maximum chromium removal was reached at 5 670 lx being 80 15 89 31 and 76 99 for conditions of 10 mg l 30 mg l and 60 mg l of cr vi respectively while in the absence of light the lowest total chromium removal rates were verified for all initial concentrations of cr vi evaluated it suggests the dark impairs the metabolic mechanism therefore the bioremediation process is energy dependent being stimulated by light as reported by gorbi et al 56 who evaluated the effect of light on chromium toxicity in single celled freshwater algae strain scenedesmus acutus in which chromium absorption occurred slowly when subjected to weak light furthermore the uptake of metals is a dependent metabolic mechanism since it occurs only in living cells in addition to requiring energy to transport cr vi to cells 44 in conditions of high cr vi concentrations 90 mg l and 110 mg l the increase in light intensity did not result in increments in the efficiency of total chromium removal the authors verified the lowest total chromium removal and the lowest cell density in high concentrations of cr vi the chromium removal capacity decreased with the increase of the initial concentration of chromium according to the studies by sun et al 55 enterobacter sp grown in an anaerobic reactor with residual molasses as a carbon source for the cr vi reduction process these authors observed the cr vi removal decreased as the cr vi concentration increased an initial concentration of cr vi of 30 mg l presented 88 80 of chromium removal after 18 h in reactors with concentrations greater than 100 mg l a longer reaction time was required to achieve the same percentage of removal furthermore if the concentration of cr vi is high the result is inhibition of bacterial growth and activity thus affecting the bacterial reduction of cr vi likewise in the work developed by hu et al 54 the results also prove that increasing the concentration of cr vi reduced the removal of cr vi from a indicus yy 1 for an initial concentration of cr vi of 20 mg l a removal efficiency of 93 52 was achieved while for an initial concentration of cr vi of 80 mg l the removal efficiency was only 15 16 another factor that should be mentioned is that the chromium reduction time increases with increasing chromium concentration due to the saturation of the reductase enzyme responsible for chromium reduction 57 different chromate reductases chrr yief nema and lpdh present in the cytoplasmic fraction soluble or bound to the membrane have been reported to catalyze the reaction under aerobic or anaerobic conditions or both soluble reductases participate in the extracellular or intracellular reduction of cr vi 58 however membrane associated reductase shows extracellular reduction 59 as an example of enzymes of an extracellular nature priester et al 60 reported the cytoplasm originated chromate reductases that reduced cr vi extracellularly in p putida regarding intracellular reduction cr vi is reduced in the cytosol by cytoplasmic soluble reductase enzymes as an example of bacteria that reduce cr vi extracellularly the following stand out p aeruginosa pseudomonas sp rhodobacter sphaeroides 45 in the process of reducing hexavalent chromium 44 to trivalent chromium the enzyme reductase produced by cells directs this reduction by direct and indirect means functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and amino present on the cell surface of bacteria bind to hexavalent chromium or trivalent chromium to form complexes reduced trivalent chromium accumulates intracellularly the serratia sp c8 isolated from tannery effluents can reduce cr vi to cr iii by intracellular reductase in addition cr iii accumulated in the cell it is common knowledge bacillus tcl strain has an exopolysaccharide the structure can combine with cr iii and form an extracellular exopolysaccharide complex 61 after a short time the total chromium corresponds to trivalent chromium the trivalent chromium after the reduction has several paths for example it can bind with the anions present in the medium to form precipitates complexes and others also it was accumulated intracellularly or extracellularly the cell membrane can form a complex to inhibit the entry of the metal into the cell 44 heavy metal resistance mechanism in bacteria can be verified for example using the metal in small amounts destined for their metabolic activities offering resistance at levels of toxic substances detoxifying excess metal 62 it is also relevant to discuss the results obtained from the control assays the control assays were based on the evaluation of light on chromium removal in these experiments there was no presence of bacterial biomass fig 2 shows the variation in the results in relation to the concentration of hexavalent chromium and total chromium at the same time intervals respectively hexavalent chromium and total chromium concentrations did not modify thus it is possible to conclude that only the light intensity does not interfere in chromium reduction in addition figs 3 and 4 illustrates bioremediation process evolution within certain hours of interval 3 3 bacteriochlorophyll and total carotenoids production bacterial biomass is rich in protein carotenoids bacteriochlorophyll biopolymers antimicrobial agents and pantothenic acid 36 among these several components bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid pigments stand out due to their application as food coloring vitamin a and precursors in food and animal feed 63 64 these pigments are considered light collectors in photosynthetic bacteria 65 they provide the capture and transferring light energy in chemical energy for the cell growth fig 5 represents the bacteriochlorophyll content at the beginning and the end in the absence of luminosity the lowest content of bacteriochlorophyll was observed regarding the content of carotenoids in fig 6 there was no production of carotenoids in the absence of light some studies have shown that photo pigment synthesis in algae did not occur under conditions of total darkness 66 the bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids content increased with increments in light intensity especially when comparing the results obtained at 800 lx to 5 670 lx for conditions of lower initial concentrations of hexavalent cr of 10 mg l 30 mg l and 60 mg l and control conditions the maximum concentrations of bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids were 2 22 mg m3 and 1 47 mg m3 respectively for the culture condition with 60 mg l cr vi under a light intensity of 5 670 lx the presence of light favors the synthesis of bacteriochlorophyll photosynthetic pigments or light gathering complexes absorb much of the light energy both are present in cells and bind to protein components of the photosynthetic system in the cell membrane 36 the carotenoid represents an oxidant acting as a light gathering pigment in photosynthetic microorganisms 65 schagerl and muller 67 showed the carotenoid pigment as a light collector when exposed to weak light in addition it played an important role in photoprotection when submitted to intense luminosity zhou et al 40 investigated the production of pigments bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids in wastewater treatment by rhodopseudomonas bacterium these authors observed that the carotenoid content decreased with increasing light intensity between 500 lx and 2 000 lx in addition the production of carotenoids was lower at 2 000 lx while in the range of 2 000 lx to 8 000 lx carotenoid content increased with increments in the light intensity reaching 1 45 mg l also the bacteriochlorophyll content decreased with increments in the light intensity from 500 lx to 2 000 lx however in the range of 2 000 lx to 8 000 lx the bacteriochlorophyll content increased with increments in the light intensity it has been reported that high light intensity can stimulate bacteriochlorophyll production for growth increases in the bacteriochlorophyll content may also be associated with increases in biomass which is also influenced by light intensity also at 800 lx and 3 200 lx increases in pigment content bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids were observed under conditions of initial concentrations of cr vi of 60 mg l 90 mg l and 110 mg l than compared to the lowest chromium contents 10 mg l and 30 mg l the highest bacteriochlorophyll content was 1 60 mg m3 110 mg l cr vi and 3 200 lx in addition 1 18 mg m3 of carotenoid content was reached for 60 mg l and 90 mg l of cr vi the phenomenon is explained through the mechanisms adopted by the microorganism s metabolism to overcome the oxidative stress caused by chromium in addition the increased production of pigments and the release of substances into the environment can reduce the toxicity of the metal 69 to synthetic medium with low initial concentrations of cr vi 10 mg l and 30 mg l low production of pigments was observed for these conditions of low light intensity an explanation may be related to metabolism biomass density is increased as well as removing chromium in contrast pigment production is not privileged in addition increments in light intensity did not contribute with the production of pigments bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids for the conditions of high cr concentrations vi of 90 mg l and 110 mg l since in these conditions the oxidative stress caused by chromium and the effect of excessive light intensity is considered a limiting factor for cell growth and pigment synthesis however 3 200 lx is the ideal light intensity for the production of biomass and pigments bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids finally the concentration of bacteriochlorophyll was higher than the carotenoids probably light stimulated the synthesis of bacteriochlorophyll in its excitation states and did not significantly contribute to the biological synthesis of carotenoids however the behavior is specific to the photosynthetic bacterium r capsulatus to better understand the influence of light intensity the consolidated findings obtained concerning maximum cell density pigment contents and chromium removal are shown table 3 from the results presented in table 3 at the light intensity of 5 670 lx the highest total chromium removals were obtained for the conditions of initial hexavalent chromium concentrations of 10 mg l 30 mg l and 60 mg l high biomass densities and pigment content were also verified finally the total chromium removal occurs in a shorter time wang et al 34 investigated the viability of the bacterial strain shewanella loihica pv 4 in the chromium reduction process these authors verified the presence of a different source of organic carbon removal of 91 2 of hexavalent chromium after 27 days hexavalent chromium 52 2 mg l and citrate as a carbon source were used hu et al 69 explored ph conditions in the bioremediation of aquifers contaminated with hexavalent chromium complete removal of contaminants was observed at an initial ph of 10 0 and 11 0 using an initial concentration of hexavalent chromium of 10 mg l through a microbial community for the other ph conditions 5 0 7 0 and 12 0 the removal ranged from 10 to 30 table 4 presented a brief comparison concerning cr vi removal by bacterial strains the findings showed different performance at diverse strains in comparison with r capsulatus such as p pabuli 1 28 fold higher b cereus 1 04 fold lower b subtilis mnu16 1 04 fold lower and s oneidensis mr 1 1 12 fold higher it s important to note the similar toxic original used however similar responses were provided by bacterial cultures in conclusion r capsulatus is resistant to cr vi this might be a good basis for use in bioremediation experiments indicated that r capsulatus has the same potential for chromium removal as others it is worth noting that although there is variability or even genetic manipulation the higher potential of the pns investigated in the current work stands out 4 conclusion the current work demonstrated that rhodobacter capsulatus was able to produce biomass bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids in a toxic medium with the presence of chromium in general in the first 12 h the time interval in which the process of reduction of hexavalent chromium to trivalent chromium occurs there was a slight cell growth therefore the metabolism was directed toward the bioreduction process the increase in light intensity contributed to increasing biomass and total chromium removal 80 2 10 mgcrvi l 89 3 30 mgcrvi l and 77 0 60 mgcrvi l also the production of bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids to 10 mg l 30 mg l and 60 mg l cr vi at 5 670 lx was observed however under high concentrations of hexavalent cr 90 mg l e 110 mg l cell growth inhibition was verified and slow efficiency in removing chromium in addition to overcome the oxidative stress caused by chromium the strategy adopted by the microorganism was to increase the production of pigments carotenoids their production was disadvantaged by the lack of light finally the practical implication should be considering ex situ bioremediation less labor intensive cheap eco friendly sustainable and relatively easy to implement besides in general the removal process quickly reaches a plateau and the treatment was favorable despite the high concentration of biomass formed declaration of competing interest the

eutrophication and fish mortality in water body is recognized as an important pollutant in the past 40 years nitrogen removal from the municipal wastewater with low chemical oxygen demand cod to total nitrogen tn ratio c n usually needed to be supplemented with the external liquid carbon sources such as methanol ethanol and acetic acid as electron donors to enhance the heterotrophic denitrification by microbes in the anoxic tank of the anaerobic anoxic oxic aao wastewater treatment processes 1 2 however the liquid carbon sources are relatively expensive and have safety risks during transportation and storage 3 4 solid biodegradable organic carbon which serves as carbon source and biofilm carrier is developed for the solid phase denitrification process 5 6 solid carbon sources can be divided into synthetic biodegradable polymers and natural lignocellulosic tissues 4 7 because of the stable carbon release rate and low secondary pollution risk synthetic solid carbon sources are widely used for the treatment of nitrate contaminated groundwater drinking water secondary effluent of wastewater treatment plant wwtp and for enhancement of the nitrogen removal of the low c n municipal wastewater but their production costs are relatively high 8 9 natural lignocellulosic carbon sources are economical and can be easily obtained which have more potential for industrial application in the anoxic tank of aao process for wwtp and attracted more researchers to pay attention 8 10 however due to the strongly intermeshed and bonded cellulose hemicellulose and lignin on surface matrix 11 raw lignocellulosic solid carbon sources exhibit recalcitrance to the enzymes of denitrification microbes thus leading to inferior denitrification performance compared with synthetic solid carbon sources 4 pretreatment processes such as mechanical comminution and alkali acid and organosolv treatment are carried out to disrupt the strongly bonded structures and enhance the utilization efficiency of lignocellulosic carbon sources for denitrification and alkali treatment is the most commonly used method due to its low cost ambient temperature and ambient pressure 11 12 alkali treatment causes cellulose swelling and lignin and hemicellulose removal and leads to more exposure of cellulose to enzymes 12 14 with alkali treatment lignocellulosic materials such as corncob 15 loofah straw 16 bagasse wheat straw 17 crop residue 18 and corn straw 19 can perform high bio availability and excellent denitrification potential aquatic macrophytes from constructed wetlands cws become an emerging source of lignocellulosic wastes 20 plant biomass from cws such as iris 21 giant reed 22 and cattail 23 are utilized as denitrification carbon sources comparative studies about the denitrification performance between aquatic macrophyte carbon sources and conventional agricultural waste carbon sources with alkali treatment are rarely reported besides the fluid wastes with high alkalinity generated from alkali treatment need to be properly handled to avoid secondary pollution 24 25 however there are few studies concern the treatment and reuse of the modification fluid wastes since abundant organic matters as hemicellulose and sugar degradation components are dissolved in the fluid wastes 26 they might be recycled and reused as external liquid carbon sources this paper aims to 1 compare the substance release capacity of alkali treated aquatic macrophytes and agricultural wastes and explore the optimal pretreatment alkalinity for the best release capacity 2 investigate the denitrification performance of selected alkali modified carbon sources and 3 evaluate the reuse feasibility of the fluid wastes generated from alkali treatment as external liquid

dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence 3d eem of the aao mbr influent and effluent were analyzed by fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi co tokyo japan with xenon lamp source 700

eem analysis thus to reduce the inner filter effect 28 29 fluorescence regional integration fri method 30 was used to analyze the matrix data removal of scatter and graph drawing were performed by matlab r2019b and domfluor toolkit 31 3 results and discussion 3 1 substrate release capacity of materials the amount of carbon released by lignocellulosic materials is closely related to denitrification performance 32 34 and the denitrification performance is also influenced by factors such as the lignocellulosic materials shape surface area particle size and pretreatment methods 16 35 hence the carbon release capacity of lignocellulosic materials under different alkalinity pretreatment can be referenced to estimate the denitrification capacity of materials which is helpful for determining the optimal alkalinity for material pretreatment to find the optimal alkalinity that maximize the carbon release capacity of each kind of investigated materials the carbon release capacity of the cellulosic materials pretreated under different alkalinity pretreatment were compared it could be seen from fig s1 that all investigated materials had significant cod release 40 mg l in the first 48 h and the whole release process could be divided into rapid period 0 2 d and stable period 2 d 8 d as shown in fig 2 a and fig s1 modified materials released more cod than the unmodified ones during rapid period which was caused by the breakdown of hemicelluloses lignin linkage and dissolve of some fragments 11 great enhancement of carbon release was observed during the stable period 4 gr 4 cc and 4 cs had the highest carbon release capacity among the modified grs ccs and css and their daily cod release of stable period were 18 68 38 73 and 11 74 higher than those of the unmodified ones among all the investigated materials 4 cs had the highest cod release capacity 4 36 mg cod g material d during the stable period the organic matters released from raw and alkali modified materials were the easily soluble organics on their surface and the higher release capacity the more suitable to be used as solid denitrification carbon sources 36 the optimal alkalinity for modification of cellulosic materials was selected according to daily cod release of stable period the daily cod release of 4 gr 2 cc 4 cc and 4 cs during stable period were 2 26 2 50 2 51 and 4 36 mg g material d respectively 4 cc and 2 cc had similar release capacity but the naoh concentration 2 required for 2 cc modification was much lower than that 4 of 4 cc therefore 4 cs 2 cc and 4 gr were selected for further denitrification research cellulosic carbon sources release phosphorus 33 which may increase the phosphorus load during the municipal wastewater treatment process as demonstrated in fig 2 b 0 cs 1 cs 2 cs and 4 cs had significant tp release during both rapid and stable periods compared with cc based and gr based materials and the daily tp release varied from 0 045 mg g d to 0 151 mg g d during the stable period high phosphorus release of milled cs carbon sources is also reported in other study 37 compared with raw and alkali modified cs materials the daily tp release of raw and alkali modified ccs undetected during stable period and grs 0 045 mg g d during stable period were negligible 3 2 denitrification performance of modified materials the denitrification performance of investigated materials were shown in fig 3 and their average denitrification capacity of the initial and steady periods were listed in table 1 initial period and steady period were divided by the disappearance of significant cod accumulation i e 40 mg l of all groups on the 5th day on the 1st day all groups including cg reached high daily tn removal mass fig 3 b but cod accumulation only detected in 4 gr 4 cs and 2 cc which indicates that the residual ethanol carried by inoculated ethanol acclimated sludge was preferentially utilized by microbes and organic matter released from lignocellulosic materials accumulated the fluctuation of 4 cs and 2 cc daily tn removal mass showed the acclimation of microbes to lignocellulosic carbon sources during 2 5 days and the daily tn removal mass of 4 cs and 2 cc were 2 23 0 34 mg g d and 1 63 0 45 mg g d on the 2nd day which were the lowest during the initial period meanwhile the nitrite accumulation of 4 cs and 2 cc were the highest on 2nd day fig 3 d with the value of 0 468 0 090 mg l and 1 751 0 372 mg l respectively it was suggested that nitrite accumulation may relate to the deficiency of available carbon source for heterotrophic denitrifiers 33 and the denitrifiers cannot fully acclimated to cellulose components released from 4 cs and 2 cc on the 2nd day on the contrary inoculated sludge microbes showed better acceptance to 4 gr carbon source no nitrite accumulation was detected during the whole experiment the daily tn removal mass of 4 cs and 2 cc peaked at 3 45 0 09 mg g d and 3 59 0 06 mg g d on 3rd day then declined and became stable meanwhile accumulation of nitrite and cod of 4 cs and 2 cc declined gradually during the 3 5 days fig 3 b the above mentioned phenomenon indicates the acclimation of sludge to 4 cs and 2 cc carbon sources have been completed during initial period and the denitrification performance of 4 cs and 2 cc became stable during the steady period 6 22 d fig 3 b the daily tn removal mass of 4 cs and 2 cc kept stable throughout the steady period and the average tn removal mass were 1 53 0 04 mg g d and 1 39 0 12 mg g d respectively table 1 which suggests the formation of mature denitrification biofilm and the high capability of 4 cs and 2 cc to serve as slow release carbon sources the denitrification performance of 4 gr was more stable than 4 cc and 2 cs and there was no daily tn removal mass peak the cod accumulation of 4 gr was only detected on the 1st day which illustrated that the quick acclimation of microbes to 4 gr carbon sources ingredients could be obtained but available carbon released was insufficient the average tn removal mass of 4 gr was 0 55 0 06 mg g d in the steady period table 1 and it was much lower than that of 4 cs and 2 cc which indicated that the higher dosage of 4 gr should be required for enhancement of the nitrogen removal in the application excessive ammonia nitrogen from lignocellulosic carbon sources has been observed due to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and protein decomposition in previous studies 33 34 38 but no ammonia accumulation was detected in any groups during this whole experiment fig 3 c this phenomenon may be due to the fact that the inoculated sludge was mature activated sludge in which nitrifying bacteria was one of the dominant species and could utilize oxygen to convert generated ammonia into nitrite under anoxic conditions 39 40 then it was utilized by denitrifiers 3 3 characteristics of raw and modified materials 3 3 1 composition of the selected materials neutral detergent fiber ndf which is the major component of plant biomass and mainly consists of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin is the popular index to estimate the cell wall components of biomass 41 cellulose and hemicellulose are effective carbon sources that can be utilized by denitrifiers 21 36 the ndf and cellulosic components of the experimental materials are shown in fig 4 from which it can be seen that the ndf increased obviously after alkali pretreatment and the moisture and other ingredients decreased correspondingly the ndf component of 0 cc 0 cs and 0 gr were 64 63 and 77 while those of 2 cc 4 cs and 4 gr were 90 85 and 88 respectively the ndf content increase is also observed in alkali treated lignocellulosic materials 16 26 higher ndf content means that more electron donors could be provided by the same dosage and lower moisture is beneficial to the storage of materials it can be seen from fig 4 b that the cellulose of 2 cc 4 cs and 4 gr increased to 53 74 and 66 which were 11 19 and 12 higher than those of 0 cc 0 cs and 0 gr and the hemicellulose content of the modified materials decreased dramatically among the key components of lignocellulose hemicellulose is the most chemically sensitive one 42 which functions as the bridge between lignin and cellulose fibers thus forms the whole cellulose hemicellulose lignin network rigid 24 the hemicellulose impedes the contact of denitrifier enzymes with cellulose 11 43 the cellulose increase and hemicellulose removal in ndf of modified materials indicated the breakdown of cellulose hemicellulose lignin network and the improvement of carbon source digestibility caused by alkali treatment in summary alkali treatment disrupted the structure of lignocellulosic carbon sources increased its ndf content and the cellulose component of ndf thus improved the digestibility of lignocellulosic materials for denitrification microbes 3 3 2 surface property of the selected materials it can be seen from fig 5 a f and k that honeycomb structure was formed on the surface of 0 cc and the surface of 0 cs and 0 gr were smooth and flat the 2 cc surface had numerous irregular folds after modification fig 5 b which provided big specific surface area for microbes fig 5 c d and e spherical bacillus spiral and filamentous microorganisms with large amount of extracellular polymeric substances eps were observed on 2 cc surface compared with 0 cs fig 5 f the surface of 4 cs fig 5 g became rough and swell and the destroyed structure provided high proportion of fibers for microbes attachment as shown in fig 5 h spherical and bacillus bacteria formed the biofilm on the fibers and the appearance of mature biofilm was in consistent with the high denitrification performance the 4 gr surface became rough and coarse after modification fig 5 l but its variation was much less than that of 4 cs fig 5 g some cellulosic fragments mixed with the microorganisms fig 5 m and n and the 4 gr surface was not completely breakdown after 21 days denitrification operation which supported the phenomenon that 4 gr had less denitrification capacity than 2 cc and 4 cs 3 4 fluid waste reuse investigation alkali treated lignocellulosic materials have been proved high efficiency in this study and several relative researches but the reuse of modification fluid wastes generated also should be considered for the whole process of its green industrial application in this study the modifying soaking and washing alkali fluids were generated during the modification of materials section 2 2 and about 1 3 l fluid wastes were generated every 100 g materials modified modification with high liquid to solid ratios were also usually reported in previous researches involving alkali modified lignocellulosic materials such as 300 ml alkali to 6 g milled corncob 44 400 ml alkali to 20 g loofah corn straw 16 and 300 ml alkali to 50 g corn stover 45 which indicates the generation of large amount of fluid wastes and it is necessity for their proper reuse 3 4 1 fluid waste reuse investigation the fluid waste of 2 cc 4 gr and 4 cs were added into the aao mbr influent with 1 10 volume ratio during stages 2 3 and 4 and the cod ammonia tn and tp removal were illustrated in fig 6 during the whole experiment the removal efficiency of ammonia 97 35 100 kept stable fig 6 b and that of cod decreased slightly from 96 23 1 10 of stage 1 to 89 20 0 90 91 60 2 43 and 94 45 2 21 of stages 2 3 and 4 respectively fig 6 a which suggested the rapid acclimation of the microbial system to all fluid wastes and the slight accumulation of organic matters that hard to be decomposed during stage 1 the average tn removal was 43 09 3 09 and the tp removal was low which indicated the deficiency of carbon sources with addition of the fluid wastes of 2 cc 4 cs and 4 gr the influent cod increased from 173 86 2 47 mg l to 319 14 23 39 mg l 304 86 5 95 mg l and 462 95 26 31 mg l respectively and the increase of influent c n ratio was beneficial to the removal of tn and tp after the addition of 2 cc 4 gr and 4 cs fluid wastes the effluent tn was reduced from 18 51 1 10 mg l to 10 63 1 19 mg l 8 58 0 65 mg l and 8 84 0 62 mg l at stage 2 3 and 4 and the corresponding tn removal efficiency were 64 77 2 76 70 16 2 12 and 71 97 2 64 meanwhile the average effluent tp decreased from 2 64 0 20 mg l to 1 06 0 10 mg l 1 77 0 24 mg l and 1 64 0 02 mg l respectively the significantly enhanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance demonstrated the efficiency of fluid wastes as electron donor which indicated the feasibility of fluid waste reuse as external carbon sources the tn removal efficiency was improved from 43 09 to 71 97 which was close to that improved from 65 8 to 78 5 of aao which was added untreated corncob in the anoxic tank with the same reflow ratio i e 200 46 the 36 mg l influent tn concentration decreased to a minimum of 8 58 mg l which was also similar to that with an average of 40 7 mg l influent tn decreased to 9 14 mg l effluent tn of a full scale aao with acetic acid as external carbon source 47 the addition of fluid wastes presented similar denitrification performance to the addition of solid lignocellulose carbon source and traditional liquid carbon source which indicates its high bio availability and reuse possibility it is worth mentioning that the 4 cs fluid waste led to notable increase of influent tp which was consist with the tp release of 4 cs during the rapid period fig 2 since the biological phosphorus removal relies on excess sludge discharge the increase of influent tp has negative influence on the biological treatment process with high sludge retention time srt 48 the feasibility of fluid waste reuse suggested that the waste generated from lignocellulosic materials can be utilized completely for denitrification and the alkali neutralized fluid wastes are harmless for its high bio availability the simple pretreatment method used in this study provides a new way for fluid waste reuse for industrial application furthermore the only chemical demanded for fluid waste neutralization i e sulfuric acid could be substituted by waste acid in large scale applications which will decrease the cost of neutralization and become more environment friendly 3 4 2 eem analysis of the fluid wastes dom of the influent and effluent of biological treatment process is usually monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy 49 eem analysis of the influent and effluent dom in stages 2 3 and 4 were demonstrated in fig 7 and the influent was added with the fluid wastes of 2 cc 4 gr and 4 cs respectively as demonstrated in fig 7 a no obvious peak was observed in the influent of stage 1 the only organic matter dissolved in simulated wastewater was glucose like most simple hydrocarbons glucose has no conjugated π bonds and no rigid molecular planar structure so it theoretically produces very weak or no fluorescence previous study has shown that such simple hydrocarbons cannot be detected by eem 50 as shown in fig 7 b and d the intensity of the peaks at ex em of 220 315 nm and 275 315 nm tuv2 peaks were quite high in stage 2 with 2 cc fluid waste addition and stage 4 with 4 cs fluid waste addition and the tuv2 peaks were corresponding to polyphenol like compounds which had been reported as water soluble organic matters emitted from corn 51 the peak at ex em of 275 315 nm might also be the absorption of tryptophan and protein like substances 52 it can be seen from fig 7 c that the peak at ex em of 225 325 nm tuv1 peak was only occurred in stage 3 with 4 gr fluid waste addition which might related with protein like substances 52 the substances related with tuv1 and tuv2 peaks had the potential of microbial decomposition which could be served as carbon sources 53 as illustrated in fig 7 b c and d the dom of stage 2 and stage 4 influent were quite similar which suggested that the dominant compounds released from 2 cc and 4 cs modification were similar but they were different from those from 4 gr modification stage 3 influent peak at ex em of 275 360 nm t2 peak is in accordance with tryptophan like protein 54 56 which was only found in stage 3 influent and its region is often overlapped with the lignin related fluorescence region 57 lignin is often considered as component of humic substances 57 peak at ex em of 330 420 nm c2 peak was only observed in stage 3 influent which indicated the existence of humic like substances 52 and humic was difficult for microbial decomposition it can be concluded from the result mentioned above that dominant components of stage 3 influent with 4 gr fluid waste are lignin like substances which were hard to be utilized by microbes and thus led to the increase of effluent cod the characteristics of the aao mbr effluents are shown in fig 7 e h no significant peak was found in the effluent of stage 1 fig 7 e peak with high intensity at ex em of 280 340 nm t1 peak ex em of 320 405 nm c1 peak and ex em of 240 410 nm a1 peak appeared in the effluents of stages 2 3 and 4 the tryptophan like substances corresponding to t1 peak 56 might be derived from the tryptophan like substances in the t2 or tuv2 region and the humus like substances corresponding to c1 peak 52 57 might be derived from lignin like substances these substances are difficult to be decomposed by microorganisms which may result in the increase of effluent cod the regions of c1 and a1 peak were related with many chromophoric dissolved organic matters cdom 58 59 which was in consistent with the increase of effluent cod with fluid wastes addition therefore the dosage of fluid wastes as carbon sources should be optimized to alleviate secondary pollution as shown in fig 6 a no significant cod accumulation occurred in the effluent of stages 2 3 and 4 40 mg l which indicated that most substances of the alkali modification fluid wastes can be decomposed 4 conclusions with their highest carbon release capacity 4 cs 2 cc and 4 gr were selected as the suitable alkali pretreated carbon sources and their surface structure was disrupted by alkali their relative content of ndf and relative cellulose content in ndf were also increased by alkali the denitrification capacity of 4 cs was the highest 1 59 0 04 mg g d during steady period 6 21 d and that of 2 cc 1 46 0 12 mg g d was slightly lower but microbes cannot quickly acclimate to them during initial period 1 5 d 4 gr had lower denitrification capacity than 4 cs and 2 cc 0 55 0 06 mg g d during steady period but microbes showed better acceptance to it mature biofilm morphology was observed on all of the material surface after the denitrification experiment moreover after residual alkalinity neutralization the fluid wastes generated from alkali modification had high bio availability and can be recycled as external carbon source for enhancing denitrification of aao mbr which provide a new eco strategy for fluid waste reuse in industrial application however addition of fluid wastes in the aao mbr influent led to slight increase of effluent cod and several dom components that is difficult for microbial decomposition were detected in the effluent declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

12591,three kinds of lignocellulosic materials i e corn straw cs corn cob cc and giant reed gr were selected and modified by alkali and substrate release capacity and denitrification performance of

materials reduce the operation cost and avoid secondary pollution risks graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords alkali modified lignocellulosic carbon sources denitrification alkali pretreatment fluid waste reuse carbon release three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction excess nitrogen which leads to eutrophication and fish mortality in water body is recognized as an important pollutant in the past 40 years nitrogen removal from the municipal wastewater with low chemical oxygen demand cod to total nitrogen tn ratio c n usually needed to be supplemented with the external liquid carbon sources such as methanol ethanol and acetic acid as electron donors to enhance the heterotrophic denitrification by microbes in the anoxic tank of the anaerobic anoxic oxic aao wastewater treatment processes 1 2 however the liquid carbon sources are relatively expensive and have safety risks during transportation and storage 3 4 solid biodegradable organic carbon which serves as carbon source and biofilm carrier is developed for the solid phase denitrification process 5 6 solid carbon sources can be divided into synthetic biodegradable polymers and natural lignocellulosic tissues 4 7 because of the stable carbon release rate and low secondary pollution risk synthetic solid carbon sources are widely used for the treatment of nitrate contaminated groundwater drinking water secondary effluent of wastewater treatment plant wwtp and for enhancement of the nitrogen removal of the low c n municipal wastewater but their production costs are relatively high 8 9 natural lignocellulosic carbon sources are economical and can be easily obtained which have more potential for industrial application in the anoxic tank of aao process for wwtp and attracted more researchers to pay attention 8 10 however due to the strongly intermeshed and bonded cellulose hemicellulose and lignin on surface matrix 11 raw lignocellulosic solid carbon sources exhibit recalcitrance to the enzymes of denitrification microbes thus leading to inferior denitrification performance compared with synthetic solid carbon sources 4 pretreatment processes such as mechanical comminution and alkali acid and organosolv treatment are carried out to disrupt the strongly bonded structures and enhance the utilization efficiency of lignocellulosic carbon sources for denitrification and alkali treatment is the most commonly used method due to its low cost ambient temperature and ambient pressure 11 12 alkali treatment causes cellulose swelling and lignin and hemicellulose removal and leads to more exposure of cellulose to enzymes 12 14 with alkali treatment lignocellulosic materials such as corncob 15 loofah straw 16 bagasse wheat straw 17 crop residue 18 and corn straw 19 can perform high bio availability and excellent denitrification potential aquatic macrophytes from constructed wetlands cws become an emerging source of lignocellulosic wastes 20 plant biomass from cws such as iris 21 giant reed 22 and cattail 23 are utilized as denitrification carbon sources comparative studies about the denitrification performance between aquatic macrophyte carbon sources and conventional agricultural waste carbon sources with alkali treatment are rarely reported besides the fluid wastes with high alkalinity generated from alkali treatment need to be properly handled to avoid secondary pollution 24 25 however there are few studies concern the treatment and reuse of the modification fluid wastes since abundant organic matters as hemicellulose and sugar degradation components are dissolved in the fluid wastes 26 they might be recycled and reused as external liquid carbon sources this paper aims to 1 compare the substance release capacity of alkali treated aquatic macrophytes and agricultural wastes and explore the optimal pretreatment alkalinity for the best release capacity 2 investigate the denitrification performance of selected alkali modified carbon sources and 3 evaluate the reuse feasibility of the fluid wastes generated from alkali treatment as external liquid carbon source for denitrification and study their dissolved organic materials dom characteristics 2 material and methods 2 1 raw materials common agricultural wastes corncob cc and corn straw cs were collected from the rural area of lianyungang jiangsu province china giant reed gr i e arundo donax linnaeus was collected from a full scale cw in the erhai lake basin yunnan province china raw plant materials were cleaned with tap water cut into 3 to 4 cm pieces and then dried at 95 c 2 2 alkali modification and substrate release capacity evaluation of materials cs cc and gr were soaked in 0 1 2

substrate release capacity to alleviate the negative impact of excess cod and tp accumulation in the initial 48 h the modified materials were soaked in tap water for 48 h at ambient temperature and then dried for the denitrification experiment three grams of selected materials were put in a polyethylene mesh bag with 35 cm length 15 20 cm width and 2 3 mm mesh size and 30 g of gravel were added to avoid floating control group cg was set up with mesh bag containing gravels only prepared mesh bags 420 ml simulated anoxic tank influent sati and 80 ml sludge which collected from beijing jingyushun wwtp and acclimated by 0 05 ethanol for 48 h were added into 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks then incubated in a shaker 25 c 150 rpm sati was prepared with nano3 ethanol and ultra pure water and the cod no3 n and tp of which were 10 mg l 36 mg l and 10 mg l respectively the cod mlss and tn of inoculated sludge were measured as 440 mg l 6954 mg l and 0 78 mg l the denitrification experiment was performed in intermittent mode by supernatant substitution during initial period 1 5 d sludge was settled and 300 ml supernatant was replaced with equal amount of sati every day similarly during steady period 6 21 d 300 ml supernatant was substituted by sati every 2 days cod tn ammonia nh3 n and nitrite no2 n of the supernatants were measured after 0 45 μm membrane filtration each experiment group was operated in three duplicates for 21 days 2 4 reuse possibility of fluid wastes modification of each kind of investigated materials produced about 5 l soaking and washing fluid and 1 l residual alkaline modification fluid the above mentioned fluids of 4 gr 2 cc and 4 cs were mixed respectively the residual naoh dissolved were neutralized by sulfuric acid then they were diluted to 30 l respectively and marked as fluid waste of 4 gr 2 cc and 4 cs the aao mbr was built up for evaluating the reuse feasibility of the fluid wastes of 4 gr 2 cc and 4 cs fig 1 only simulated domestic wastewater was fed for aao mbr during stage 1 as a control stage then fluid wastes of 2 cc 4 gr and 4 cs were added into the simulated domestic wastewater with 1 10 volume ratio during stages 2 3 and 4 respectively cod tp tn and nh3 n of the aao mbr influent and effluent were measured every day the simulated domestic wastewater was prepared by nh4cl kh2po4 anhydrous glucose and na2co3 and the related cod nh4 n tp and alkalinity were 181 mg l 36 mg l 3 1 mg l and 0 2187 mmol l respectively other detailed operation conditions were shown in section 1 1 of the supplementary materials 2 5

denitrification performance 32 34 and the denitrification performance is also influenced by factors such as the lignocellulosic materials shape surface area particle size and pretreatment methods 16 35 hence the carbon release capacity of lignocellulosic materials under different alkalinity pretreatment can be referenced to estimate the denitrification capacity of materials which is helpful for determining the optimal alkalinity for material pretreatment to find the optimal alkalinity that maximize the carbon release capacity of each kind of investigated materials the carbon release capacity of the cellulosic materials pretreated under different alkalinity pretreatment were compared it could be seen from fig s1 that all investigated materials had significant cod release 40 mg l in the first 48 h and the whole release process could be divided into rapid period 0 2 d and stable period 2 d 8 d as shown in fig 2 a and fig s1 modified materials released more cod than the unmodified ones during rapid period which was caused by the breakdown of hemicelluloses lignin linkage and dissolve of some fragments 11 great enhancement of carbon release was observed during the stable period 4 gr 4 cc and 4 cs had the highest carbon release capacity among the modified grs ccs and css and their daily cod release of stable period were 18 68 38 73 and 11 74 higher than those of the unmodified ones among all the investigated materials 4 cs had the highest cod release capacity 4 36 mg cod g material d during the stable period the organic matters released from raw and alkali modified materials were the easily soluble organics on their surface and the higher release capacity the more suitable to be used as solid denitrification carbon sources 36 the optimal alkalinity for modification of cellulosic materials was selected according to daily cod release of stable period the daily cod release of 4 gr 2 cc 4 cc and 4 cs during stable period were 2 26 2 50 2 51 and 4 36 mg g material d respectively 4 cc and 2 cc had similar release capacity but the naoh concentration 2 required for 2 cc modification was much lower than that 4 of 4 cc therefore 4 cs 2 cc and 4 gr were selected for further denitrification research cellulosic carbon sources release phosphorus 33 which may increase the phosphorus load during the municipal wastewater treatment process as demonstrated in fig 2 b 0 cs 1 cs 2 cs and 4 cs had significant tp release during both rapid and stable periods compared with cc based and gr based materials and the daily tp release varied from 0 045 mg g d to 0 151 mg g d during the stable period high phosphorus release of milled cs carbon sources is also reported in other study 37 compared with raw and alkali modified cs materials the daily tp release of raw and alkali modified ccs undetected during stable period and grs 0 045 mg g d during stable period were negligible 3 2 denitrification performance of modified materials the denitrification performance of investigated materials were shown in fig 3 and their average denitrification capacity of the initial and steady periods were listed in table 1 initial period and steady period were divided by the disappearance of significant cod accumulation i e 40 mg l of all groups on the 5th day on the 1st day all groups including cg reached high daily tn removal mass fig 3 b but cod accumulation only detected in 4 gr 4 cs and 2 cc which indicates that the residual ethanol carried by inoculated ethanol acclimated sludge was preferentially utilized by microbes and organic matter released from lignocellulosic materials accumulated the fluctuation of 4 cs and 2 cc daily tn removal mass showed the acclimation of microbes to lignocellulosic carbon sources during 2 5 days and the daily tn removal mass of 4 cs and 2 cc were 2 23 0 34 mg g d and 1 63 0 45 mg g d on the 2nd day which were the lowest during the initial period meanwhile the nitrite accumulation of 4 cs and 2 cc were the highest on 2nd day fig 3 d with the value of 0 468 0 090 mg l and 1 751 0 372 mg l respectively it was suggested that nitrite accumulation may relate to the deficiency of available carbon source for heterotrophic denitrifiers 33 and the denitrifiers cannot fully acclimated to cellulose components released from 4 cs and 2 cc on the 2nd day on the contrary inoculated sludge microbes showed better acceptance to 4 gr carbon source no nitrite accumulation was detected during the whole experiment the daily tn removal mass of 4 cs and 2 cc peaked at 3 45 0 09 mg g d and 3 59 0 06 mg g d on 3rd day then declined and became stable meanwhile accumulation of nitrite and cod of 4 cs and 2 cc declined gradually during the 3 5 days fig 3 b the above mentioned phenomenon indicates the acclimation of sludge to 4 cs and 2 cc carbon sources have been completed during initial period and the denitrification performance of 4 cs and 2 cc became stable during the steady period 6 22 d fig 3 b the daily tn removal mass of 4 cs and 2 cc kept stable throughout the steady period and the average tn removal mass were 1 53 0 04 mg g d and 1 39 0 12 mg g d respectively table 1 which suggests the formation of mature denitrification biofilm and the high capability of 4 cs and 2 cc to serve as slow release carbon sources the denitrification performance of 4 gr was more stable than 4 cc and 2 cs and there was no daily tn removal mass peak the cod accumulation of 4 gr was only detected on the 1st day which illustrated that the quick acclimation of microbes to 4 gr carbon sources ingredients could be obtained but available carbon released was insufficient the average tn removal mass of 4 gr was 0 55 0 06 mg g d in the steady period table 1 and it was much lower than that of 4 cs and 2 cc which indicated that the higher dosage of 4 gr should be required for enhancement of the nitrogen removal in the application excessive ammonia nitrogen from lignocellulosic carbon sources has been observed due to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and protein decomposition in previous studies 33 34 38 but no ammonia accumulation was detected in any groups during this whole experiment fig 3 c this phenomenon may be due to the fact that the inoculated sludge was mature activated sludge in which nitrifying bacteria was one of the dominant species and could utilize oxygen to convert generated ammonia into nitrite under anoxic conditions 39 40 then it was utilized by denitrifiers 3 3 characteristics of raw and modified materials 3 3 1 composition of the selected materials neutral detergent fiber ndf which is the major component of plant biomass and mainly consists of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin is the popular index to estimate the cell wall components of biomass 41 cellulose and hemicellulose are effective carbon sources that can be utilized by denitrifiers 21 36 the ndf and cellulosic components of the experimental materials are shown in fig 4 from which it can be seen that the ndf increased obviously after alkali pretreatment and the moisture and other ingredients decreased correspondingly the ndf component of 0 cc 0 cs and 0 gr were 64 63 and 77 while those of 2 cc 4 cs and 4 gr were 90 85 and 88 respectively the ndf content increase is also observed in alkali treated lignocellulosic materials 16 26 higher ndf content means that more electron donors could be provided by the same dosage and lower moisture is beneficial to the storage of materials it can be seen from fig 4 b that the cellulose of 2 cc 4 cs and 4 gr increased to 53 74 and 66 which were 11 19 and 12 higher than those of 0 cc 0 cs and 0 gr and the hemicellulose content of the modified materials decreased dramatically among the key components of lignocellulose hemicellulose is the most chemically sensitive one 42 which functions as the bridge between lignin and cellulose fibers thus forms the whole cellulose hemicellulose lignin network rigid 24 the hemicellulose impedes the contact of denitrifier enzymes with cellulose 11 43 the cellulose increase and hemicellulose removal in ndf of modified materials indicated the breakdown of cellulose hemicellulose lignin network and the improvement of carbon source digestibility caused by alkali treatment in summary alkali treatment disrupted the structure of lignocellulosic carbon sources increased its ndf content and the cellulose component of ndf thus improved the digestibility of lignocellulosic materials for denitrification microbes 3 3 2 surface property of the selected materials it can be seen from fig 5 a f and k that honeycomb structure was formed on the surface of 0 cc and the surface of 0 cs and 0 gr were smooth and flat the 2 cc surface had numerous irregular folds after modification fig 5 b which provided big specific surface area for microbes fig 5 c d and e spherical bacillus spiral and filamentous microorganisms with large amount of extracellular polymeric substances eps were observed on 2 cc surface compared with 0 cs fig 5 f the surface of 4 cs fig 5 g became rough and swell and the destroyed structure provided high proportion of fibers for microbes attachment as shown in fig 5 h spherical and bacillus bacteria formed the biofilm on the fibers and the appearance of mature biofilm was in consistent with the high denitrification performance the 4 gr surface became rough and coarse after modification fig 5 l but its variation was much less than that of 4 cs fig 5 g some cellulosic fragments mixed with the microorganisms fig 5 m and n and the 4 gr surface was not completely breakdown after 21 days denitrification operation which supported the phenomenon that 4 gr had less denitrification capacity than 2 cc and 4 cs 3 4 fluid waste reuse investigation alkali treated lignocellulosic materials have been proved high efficiency in this study and several relative researches but the reuse of modification fluid wastes generated also should be considered for the whole process of its green industrial application in this study the modifying soaking and washing alkali fluids were generated during the modification of materials section 2 2 and about 1 3 l fluid wastes were generated every 100 g materials modified modification with high liquid to solid ratios were also usually reported in previous researches involving alkali modified lignocellulosic materials such as 300 ml alkali to 6 g milled corncob 44 400 ml alkali to 20 g loofah corn straw 16 and 300 ml alkali to 50 g corn stover 45 which indicates the generation of large amount of fluid wastes and it is necessity for their proper reuse 3 4 1 fluid waste reuse investigation the fluid waste of 2 cc 4 gr and 4 cs were added into the aao mbr influent with 1 10 volume ratio during stages 2 3 and 4 and the cod ammonia tn and tp removal were illustrated in fig 6 during the whole experiment the removal efficiency of ammonia 97 35 100 kept stable fig 6 b and that of cod decreased slightly from 96 23 1 10 of stage 1 to 89 20 0 90 91 60 2 43 and 94 45 2 21 of stages 2 3 and 4 respectively fig 6 a which suggested the rapid acclimation of the microbial system to all fluid wastes and the slight accumulation of organic matters that hard to be decomposed during stage 1 the average tn removal was 43 09 3 09 and the tp removal was low which indicated the deficiency of carbon sources with addition of the fluid wastes of 2 cc 4 cs and 4 gr the influent cod increased from 173 86 2 47 mg l to 319 14 23 39 mg l 304 86 5 95 mg l and 462 95 26 31 mg l respectively and the increase of influent c n ratio was beneficial to the removal of tn and tp after the addition of 2 cc 4 gr and 4 cs fluid wastes the effluent tn was reduced from 18 51 1 10 mg l to 10 63 1 19 mg l 8 58 0 65 mg l and 8 84 0 62 mg l at stage 2 3 and 4 and the corresponding tn removal efficiency were 64 77 2 76 70 16 2 12 and 71 97 2 64 meanwhile the average effluent tp decreased from 2 64 0 20 mg l to 1 06 0 10 mg l 1 77 0 24 mg l and 1 64 0 02 mg l respectively the significantly enhanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance demonstrated the efficiency of fluid wastes as electron donor which indicated the feasibility of fluid waste reuse as external carbon sources the tn removal efficiency was improved from 43 09 to 71 97 which was close to that improved from 65 8 to 78 5 of aao which was added untreated corncob in the anoxic tank with the same reflow ratio i e 200 46 the 36 mg l influent tn concentration decreased to a minimum of 8 58 mg l which was also similar to that with an average of 40 7 mg l influent tn decreased to 9 14 mg l effluent tn of a full scale aao with acetic acid as external carbon source 47 the addition of fluid wastes presented similar denitrification performance to the addition of solid lignocellulose carbon source and traditional liquid carbon source which indicates its high bio availability and reuse possibility it is worth mentioning that the 4 cs fluid waste led to notable increase of influent tp which was consist with the tp release of 4 cs during the rapid period fig 2 since the biological phosphorus removal relies on excess sludge discharge the increase of influent tp has negative influence on the biological treatment process with high sludge retention time srt 48 the feasibility of fluid waste reuse suggested that the waste generated from lignocellulosic materials can be utilized completely for denitrification and the alkali neutralized fluid wastes are harmless for its high bio availability the simple pretreatment method used in this study provides a new way for fluid waste reuse for industrial application furthermore the only chemical demanded for fluid waste neutralization i e sulfuric acid could be substituted by waste acid in large scale applications which will decrease the cost of neutralization and become more environment friendly 3 4 2 eem analysis of the fluid wastes dom of the influent and effluent of biological treatment process is usually monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy 49 eem analysis of the influent and effluent dom in stages 2 3 and 4 were demonstrated in fig 7 and the influent was added with the fluid wastes of 2 cc 4 gr and 4 cs respectively as demonstrated in fig 7 a no obvious peak was observed in the influent of stage 1 the only organic matter dissolved in simulated wastewater was glucose like most simple hydrocarbons glucose has no conjugated π bonds and no rigid molecular planar structure so it theoretically produces very weak or no fluorescence previous study has shown that such simple hydrocarbons cannot be detected by eem 50 as shown in fig 7 b and d the intensity of the peaks at ex em of 220 315 nm and 275 315 nm tuv2 peaks were quite high in stage 2 with 2 cc fluid waste addition and stage 4 with 4 cs fluid waste addition and the tuv2 peaks were corresponding to polyphenol like compounds which had been reported as water soluble organic matters emitted from corn 51 the peak at ex em of 275 315 nm might also be the absorption of tryptophan and protein like substances 52 it can be seen from fig 7 c that the peak at ex em of 225 325 nm tuv1 peak was only occurred in stage 3 with 4 gr fluid waste addition which might related with protein like substances 52 the substances related with tuv1 and tuv2 peaks had the potential of microbial decomposition which could be served as carbon sources 53 as illustrated in fig 7 b c and d the dom of stage 2 and stage 4 influent were quite similar which suggested that the dominant compounds released from 2 cc and 4 cs modification were similar but they were different from those from 4 gr modification stage 3 influent peak at ex em of 275 360 nm t2 peak is in accordance with tryptophan like protein 54 56 which was only found in stage 3 influent and its region is often overlapped with the lignin related fluorescence region 57 lignin is often considered as component of humic substances 57 peak at ex em of 330 420 nm c2 peak was only observed in stage 3 influent which indicated the existence of humic like substances 52 and humic was difficult for microbial decomposition it can be concluded from the result mentioned above that dominant components of stage 3 influent with 4 gr fluid waste are lignin like substances which were hard to be utilized by microbes and thus led to the increase of effluent cod the characteristics of the aao mbr effluents are shown in fig 7 e h no significant peak was found in the effluent of stage 1 fig 7 e peak with high intensity at ex em of 280 340 nm t1 peak ex em of 320 405 nm c1 peak and ex em of 240 410 nm a1 peak appeared in the effluents of stages 2 3 and 4 the tryptophan like substances corresponding to t1 peak 56 might be derived from the tryptophan like substances in the t2 or tuv2 region and the humus like substances corresponding to c1 peak 52 57 might be derived from lignin like substances these substances are difficult to be decomposed by microorganisms which may result in the increase of effluent cod the regions of c1 and a1 peak were related with many chromophoric dissolved organic matters cdom 58 59 which was in consistent with the increase of effluent cod with fluid wastes addition therefore the dosage of fluid wastes as carbon sources should be optimized to alleviate secondary pollution as shown in fig 6 a no significant cod accumulation occurred in the effluent of stages 2 3 and 4 40 mg l which indicated that most substances of the alkali modification fluid wastes can be decomposed 4 conclusions with their highest carbon release capacity 4 cs 2 cc and 4 gr were selected as the suitable alkali pretreated carbon sources and their surface structure was disrupted by alkali their relative content of ndf and relative cellulose content in ndf were also increased by alkali the denitrification capacity of 4 cs was the highest 1 59 0 04 mg g d during steady period 6 21 d and that of 2 cc 1 46 0 12 mg g d was slightly lower but microbes cannot quickly acclimate to them during initial period 1 5 d 4 gr had lower denitrification capacity than 4 cs and 2 cc 0 55 0 06 mg g d during steady period but microbes showed better acceptance to it mature biofilm morphology was observed on all of the material surface after the denitrification experiment moreover after residual alkalinity neutralization the fluid wastes generated from alkali modification had high bio availability and can be recycled as external carbon source for enhancing denitrification of aao mbr which provide a new eco strategy for fluid waste reuse in industrial application however addition of fluid wastes in the aao mbr influent led to slight increase of effluent cod and several dom components that is difficult for microbial decomposition were detected in the effluent declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

12592,coal mines discharge low ph acid mine drainage amd which contains a variety of heavy metals and sulfates that are extremely polluting and corrosive posing a continuous threat to the ecological environment and human health hence the effective management of amd has become a global concern by reviewing the formation mechanism hazards and composition characteristics of acid mine wastewater this study analyzed the control methods and treatment technologies that can be used for source prevention and control and finally effective governance the reaction mechanism and advantages and disadvantages of several treatment techniques including the commonly used active and passive treatments were discussed in depth and the applicability of the various technologies was evaluated our findings showed that solely relying on a single technology cannot meet the emission standards and industrial requirements for the recycling of resources including water resources valuable metals and rare earth elements according to the principle of complementary advantages an improved treatment method involving a collaborative technology was proposed to improve the removal efficiency of pollutants and resource recovery of valuable metals so as to realize a sustainable treatment of amd the predicted synergistic technology will be the main direction for future exploration and development graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords acid mine drainage source prevention final governance synergy resource recovery data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the strategic position of coal in china s energy structure has remained unchanged and coal continues to be the main source of energy according to the china sustainable energy development strategy by 2050 the contribution of coal to china s energy output will not be 50 1 the continuous mining and processing of coal resources is accompanied by the discharge of a large amount of mine wastewater according to statistics approximately two tons of mine water is produced for every one ton of coal mined currently approximately 8 billion tons of mine water is generated considering the average annual output of coal in china and the utilization of mine water is just under 25 2 most of the mines are located in arid areas with scarce water resources particularly in the northwest region where the climate is dry all year round and water resources are in serious shortage moreover the untreated sewage from coal mining and the consumption and wastage of water in the various links of mining areas pollute the existing water resources and destroy the water resource ecosystem under the long term interaction between coal bearing strata and groundwater particularly in highsulfur coal mining areas with large amounts of hematite and pyrite exposed acid mine drainage amd is easily formed as shown in fig 1 3 4 acid mine water contains sulfuric acid fe2 fe3 mn2 etc may also be enriched with some traces of toxic substances and has the characteristics of high corrosiveness high salinity and high sulfate content 5 6 almost all major coal producing countries in the world including the united states australia canada and china have serious acid mine water problems it is estimated that tens of thousands of mines around the world generate amd 7 the direct discharge of acid mine water without any advanced treatment will cause significant harm to both human life and the ecology owing to environmental protection and economic considerations various source prevention and control and final treatment technologies have emerged it is difficult to realize source prevention in practical operation and terminal treatment technologies such as active and passive treatments have been most effective the investment cost of an amd treatment technology ranges from several hundred dollars to hundreds of millions of dollars 8 with the strict discharge standards for relevant environmental sewage introduced by various countries to ensure the sustainable development of coal resources the recycling of available resources such as water metals and rare earth elements from amd is promoted to reduce economic costs or to improve the removal rate of heavy metals and salts in a collaborative manner however the selection of these technologies depends on the mineralogical characteristics of the mine geographical conditions weather and other factors 9 there is no uniformly applicable standard for any technology the applicability of each technology is unclear and the selection of the technology lacks a scientific basis therefore this paper analyzes the formation mechanism hazard and composition characteristics of amd and studies the control methods and treatment technologies for source prevention and control and terminal treatment 2 formation and dangers of acid mine drainage 2 1 formation of acid mine drainage the main sources of amd are not only mine water generated via the oxidation reaction in the mining process but also process drainage surface infiltration water and underground infiltration water 10 11 these are respectively from wastewater discharged during coal washing flotation and clean coal extraction infiltration water formed by atmospheric precipitation weathering of coal gangue piles and surface water runoff groundwater leakage from the leaching of waste ore piles tailings ponds and backfill areas 12 with the characteristics of large water volume scattered water sources and long duration fig 2 shows the production model of amd pollution amd refers to mine water with ph 5 5 which is mostly produced in the mining of metal and sulfide ores with sulfur content 1 5 13 coal mining activities change the reducing environment of groundwater flowing through coal seams and surrounding rocks into an oxidizing environment causing the pyrite fes2 to oxidize and further undergo hydrolysis under the action of thiobacillus ferrogenes generating sulfates and free sulfuric acid and reducing the ph of the mine water to make it acidic 14 at the same time fe3 oxidizes fes2 accompanied by the production of large amounts of so4 2 fe2 fe3 mn2 pb2 zn2 and cr3 plasma the main reactions are expressed in eqs 1 3 15 17 1 chemical oxidation the initial oxidation reaction of sulfide resulting in sulfate and free sulfuric acid 1 2fes2 7o2 2h2o 2feso4 2h2so4 2 microbial oxidation fe2 is unstable and further oxidizes to generate insoluble fe2 so4 3 2 4feso4 2h2so4 o2 2fe2 so4 3 2h2o 3 hydrolysis the hydrolysis reaction of fe2 so4 3 in weakly acidic water to generate free sulfuric acid and fe oh 3 3 fe2 so4 3 6h2o 2fe oh 3 3h2so4 4 oxidation of fes2 by fe3 in a solution with ph 3 the rate of pyrite oxidation by fe3 is 10 100 times that of oxygen 4 fes2 7fe2 so4 3 8h2o 15feso4 8h2so4 when the alkaline minerals in the coal seam and surrounding rock are insufficient to neutralize the sulfuric acid the wastewater will be acidic the reaction formula shows that there are differences in the physical and chemical properties of acid mine water in different environments under the coexistence of oxygen water and fungi the oxidation rate of fes2 is accelerated and acid wastewater is continuously produced 2 2 dangers of acid mine drainage the pyrite exposed to the oxidizing environment of air and water undergoes physical chemical and biological reactions to generate amd which accumulates and develops in the coal seam voids fissures and dissolved fissures in addition after the coal seam mining is completed the sealed underground goafs abandoned mines etc are prone to accumulate acidic old kiln water producing metal ions and sulfuric acid 18 which can last for decades and are extremely corrosive and soluble once these elements circulate with the groundwater the combined action will further exacerbate the effect of amd discharge on coal mining production space natural ecological environment and human health 19 20 1 production equipment amd is highly corrosive when it passes through steel materials such as drainage pipes mining devices and transportation devices corrosion will occur destroying the surface structure of the equipment and affecting its working efficiency and service life 21 2 water body and soil fe oh 3 produced by the oxidation of fe2 in the amd makes the water yellow brown and it is directly discharged into rivers lakes reservoirs etc which seriously deteriorate the water quality and inhibit the growth of aquatic organisms which may even go extinct and the ecological balance will be destroyed 22 when flowing through the soil it will deplete the soil cause the acid base imbalance of the soil affect the growth function of plants and crops and reduce the crop yield and biodiversity 23 3 human health the corrosiveness and harmfulness of amd seriously affect the health of miners exposed to long term direct contact causing skin burns sensory discomfort breathing difficulties and other adverse symptoms once in the food chain it indirectly causes health issues such as diarrhea 24 25 3 composition characteristics of acid mine drainage amd can be characterized by its wide range of sources large discharge wide coverage and complex composition under the action of oxidation and bacterial decomposition of high sulfur ores the dissolution of metal ions in minerals produces sulfates and metal precipitation substances including many anions and cations e g the most common and most concentrated so4 2 intermediate and large amounts of fe2 fe3 al3 and h as well as ca2 mg2 and cl originally contained in groundwater mn2 associated with coal seams and small amounts of cu2 zn2 pb2 cr3 cd2 and other toxic heavy metal ions dissolved in water in the surrounding rock 26 due to the difference in the compositions of coal seam rocks the characteristics of the components contained in the wastewater change accordingly 27 these are located at the edge of the area and the wastewater seriously threatens the quality of the water source and surface water environment in the nearby watershed table 1 presents the main composition distribution of typical coal mines in china some heavy metal ions in wastewater are highly toxic and do not biodegrade in nature instead they gradually accumulate and increase in concentration causing chronic and long term damage to human life and the ecology 1 the concentration of iron ions is typically much higher than those of other metal ions iron is the main trace element necessary for the human body however excess iron intake damages cells and affects the normal functioning of the human heart 2 the content of al3 is typically lower than that of iron ions and excess accumulation can cause mental retardation in children memory loss in middle aged people and dementia in the elderly 13 3 the content of so4 2 is relatively high most of which come from the oxidation of pyrite or the dissolution of sedimentary rocks containing sulfate minerals and the infiltration of surface water into the ground so4 2 is extremely corrosive according to the groundwater quality standard the sulfate discharge standard is 250 mg l 1 4 the concentration of mn2 is low mn2 has an unpleasant odor can poison animals and plants damage the human central nervous system and even cause cancer 37 5 cu2 mainly comes from copper bearing ores it has strong biocidal activity which significantly affects ecosystems and the harmfulness of copper in terms of its high concentration and high solubility makes it the main object of treatment and recovery 6 zn is easily soluble in acidic solutions and has low toxicity therefore it can reduce the immune function of the human body and cause zinc poisoning when in excess it is also a recyclable metal 7 ca2 and mg2 are widely distributed mainly produced by the dissolution of carbonate sedimentary rocks the two are found in high concentrations are relatively less harmful and have an ideal removal effect 8 pb2 is a toxic heavy metal that is difficult to remove after entering the human body it can cause congenital brain damage 38 9 although the content of cr3 is low it is highly toxic and must be removed using appropriate treatment techniques if it enters the body it can cause respiratory diseases abdominal lesions and mental disorders and 10 cd2 is one of the five poisonous substances in heavy metals it is highly toxic and stable and its absorption by the human body can cause cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and renal dysfunction 4 treatment technologies for acid mine drainage coal mining activities inevitably produce amd the amd is complex and diverse in composition pollutes over a large area and is difficult to control and manage referring to china s sewage discharge guidelines combined with the actual situation of water resource utilization in china it is necessary to vigorously promote the optimization of acid mine water control and treatment technology to achieve treatment objectives 1 supporting unified sustainable treatment technology 2 water resource recycling optimized allocation and 3 economical safe and efficient in the current research stage the technologies used to treat amd can be divided into source prevention and final treatment technology based on the degree of operability and the advantages and disadvantages of the treatment the final treatment is the mainstream technical means today 39 40 4 1 source prevention of acid mine drainage in a coal mining environment there are often spatial conditions for the formation of acidic wastewater the source of water filling is constantly gurgling the water filling paths are widely distributed the water filling intensity is difficult to estimate and the affected factors are complex including coal seam occurrence conditions hydrogeological conditions material composition of surrounding rock and mining path methods therefore source control is associated with many challenges and is difficult to achieve 41 considering the occurrence space of high sulfur coal and the layout of the oxidizing environment where water and oxygen coexist source prevention can be summarized into five principles namely prevention blocking dredging drainage and control which can be roughly divided into the following six aspects as shown in fig 3 1 performing ground waterproofing and applying surface coating to reduce atmospheric precipitation and surface water filling sources 42 preventing rainwater ice and snow rivers lakes oceans and other forms of water from infiltrating into sulfur bearing coal rock formations or using dry or water mulch to insulate waste rock or tailings from oxygen as much as possible to reduce the water rich and oxygen rich environment required for sulfide oxidation however this is inapplicable to areas where annual evaporation is greater than the precipitation and to large areas affected by rain snow and ice weather therefore practical operation is difficult 2 implementing grouting plugging for the mine water that may be filled with water and flow through the path for grouting and plugging and injecting clay mortar etc to reinforce isolate and block water flow in the channel 43 in practical application it is difficult to achieve accurate tracking and there are still formation conditions the symptoms are being treated rather than the root cause 3 to shorten the residence time of mine water the amd mainly comes from the oxidation of high sulfur ore in the coal seam and the sulfur containing substances of the coal itself in an oxidative environment such as water filled coal seams and surrounding rocks 44 particularly in the goaf where underground water has been soaked for a long time the amd is constantly flowing it is necessary to accelerate the drainage speed of the mine water and shorten the path of the mine water flowing through the coal seam 4 placing bacteriostatic agents and bactericides in the old kiln water sealed in goafs or abandoned roadways 45 by adding appropriate amounts of bacteriostatic agents to reduce the number and activity of microorganisms in mine water the biological oxidation of pyrite can be reduced bactericides can not only quickly kill microorganisms such as thiobacillus ferrogenes but also break the microbial growth environment and produce bacterial resistant microorganisms affecting the growth of aquatic phytoplankton 5 separating water discharge for non acid mine water discharge to exclusive recovery wells avoid mixing with amd thereby reducing the wastewater treatment volume and decreasing costs 6 coal gangue planning and management the coal gangue in the discharge site after beneficiation should be treated as water proof as possible to prevent the acid reclaimed water after the reaction of residual sulfide with water from seeping and moving to the coal rock formation which would increase the formation of amd or pollute the soil and water body by leakage although the amount of acidic wastewater produced in this way is small it is difficult to effectively prevent and control the underlying gangue 4 2 final treatment of acid mine drainage based on the type of technology the final treatment technology for amd can be divided into two types active and passive treatment technologies 46 47 active technology is a treatment using external energy or relying on chemical reactions mainly including neutralization precipitation adsorption ion exchange and membrane separation 48 involving precipitation sulfate reduction and ion exchange absorption filtration these are mostly used for the treatment of amd with medium to high flow and high acidity passive technology relies on natural media or materials and naturally occurring chemical and biological processes 49 common methods include the use of microbial sulfate reducing flora and the construction of artificial wetlands for low flow and low acidity environments 50 51 fig 4 shows common technical classifications the active treatment system is continuous and the technical effect is better the passive treatment method does not require continuous input of chemical reagents and the secondary pollution waste generated is less and the impact on the environment is lower 4 2 1 neutralization precipitation method the neutralization precipitation method is a common treatment method 52 fig 5 shows the process flow this method adjusts the ph value of amd by adding alkaline substances and using acid base neutralization reaction the ph is increased to the ph value required for heavy metal precipitation 53 54 metal ions in the amd are formed into insoluble hydroxide precipitates and removed from wastewater 53 commonly used neutralizers include quicklime cao limestone caco3 slaked lime ca oh 2 soda ash na2co3 and caustic soda naoh 55 table 2 presents the performance of five neutralizers 56 58 the main reaction mechanism is as follows ca oh 2 for example 5 m2 so4 2 ca oh 2 2h2o m oh 2 caso4 2h2o where m is a divalent metal ion however due to the poor solubility of gypsum generated by the solvent only part of the sulfate can be removed the magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 can produce higher ph value resulting in faster settling of metal precipitates and higher sludge density which also requires a larger sludge treatment space the method is simple in terms of the process and convenient in terms of operation however disadvantages include the large amount of sludge and other precipitation by product residues which can easily cause equipment blockage and increase the cost of secondary pollution treatment 59 60 sibrell and watten 61 showed that the neutralization of 50 metric tons of amd produces 450 metric tons of sludge at a high disposal cost of us 40 m2 in recent years with the consideration of economic cost ease of operation and high efficiency alkaline neutralizers have been gradually replaced by the recovery and utilization of by products such as lime charcoal ash slag or fly ash produced by the combustion of alkaline substances with comparable performance 62 63 these neutralizers can effectively neutralize amd efficiently treat sulfate and heavy metals and remove 99 of aluminum arsenic cadmium cobalt copper iron and manganese and approximately 50 60 of sulfate contained in wastewater amd 64 65 kaur et al 47 used industrially refined aluminum slag to form a bayer liquid alkaline waste to achieve the same substitution effect exhibiting a high mn removal rate at a low ph and with a stronger mn removal ability than lime ca oh 2 emma tuulia et al 65 removed 99 of aluminum arsenic cadmium cobalt copper iron and manganese from amd wastewater discharged in a copper zinc mine using coke lime byproducts generated in the production of quick lime the same amount of sludge was produced and approximately 50 60 of the same amount of sulfate could be removed under the treatment of quick lime and hydrated lime this helped save the cost of the chemicals used a slag matrix polymer based on a high porosity can achieve an initial sulfate removal efficiency of up to 99 and the amount of by product sludge produced is small and stable the subsequent treatment is convenient 66 kefeni et al 67 demonstrated that extremely clean nanoparticle charcoal ash has dual functions of adsorption and precipitation which can achieve the same considerable removal effect and a higher economic value the precipitation method is the most commonly used method that has been applied to mine water or tailings wastewater long term dynamic generation of amd requires that the method must be continuously applied for decades or even centuries until the formation of amd stops making it unsustainable in the long run 4 2 2 adsorption method the adsorption technology is faster than the precipitation method and is easy to operate it uses a porous solid substance with a large specific surface area to adsorb the metal ions in wastewater to concentrate the pollutants on its surface based on the change in the active functional groups and ion valency the metal ions are removed 68 the adsorbent is the focus of application commonly used adsorbents include natural materials such as zeolite sludge activated carbon bentonite wood ash and chitosan 69 70 and industrial by products such as slag sawdust manure and coal ash 71 72 table 3 presents the common applications these more commonly used conventional adsorbents such as activated carbon have a high adsorption capacity and a large specific surface area however they are relatively expensive and regeneration is difficult in comparison natural bentonite and zeolite have a good adsorption capacity though their adsorption performance is limited and are difficult to separate chitosan comes from a wide range of sources but is unsuitable for low ph conditions 77 carbon steel slag css is inexpensive can be used repeatedly and has a strong sulfate removal ability but is limited to small particle sizes in recent years the research focus has shifted to the use of new technology to prepare and develop new environmentally friendly efficient and economical adsorbents as the technology develops through carbonization activation or organic modification techniques to change the structure of functional groups or expand the pores the surface area for adsorbent materials can be increased biochar as a new material is widely used in the field of soil remediation and wastewater purification organic materials such as sludge feces wood and straw are used for hydrothermal carbonization or pyrolysis to form a pore structure based on fixed carbon fig 6 78 the formed active sites and major functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and benzene ring adsorb the heavy metal ions in amd 79 this facilitates the direct adsorption on large surface areas by charge or covalent interaction achieving a slight increase in ph and efficient removal of sulfate and metal ions yang et al 80 reported that surface biochar can also effectively improve the ph value of amd reduce the biological dissolution of chalcopyrite and thus reduce the release of copper and iron ions however such an inhibition effect is not common and the inhibition conditions required for different types of amd are different therefore there is no uniform adaptation condition in addition most studies are limited to single ion removal at a small scale and some of them are in the laboratory stage without large scale or engineering application research chindaprasirt et al 81 used fly ash and bottom ash to synthesize porous alkali activated materials aams with a large specific surface area and a large number of active adsorption sites can be synthesized which are more active than the porous structures this favors the distribution of metals on its surface owing to the heterogeneity the presence of irregular fractures and the rough structure of the biological mixture which promote the adsorption and are cheap shi et al 82 crosslinked chitosan cs and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose cmc to produce an organic copolymer film cc to organically modify magnetic alkaline calcium bentonite macb the macb cc formed exhibited a greater number of adsorption sites and better recycling performance after five cycles of desorption the adsorption rate of copper and manganese could still reach 90 this preparation method is simple and cost effective li et al 83 used an industrial by product namely red mud to remove mn ions from wastewater and found that the active groups in modified raw red mud were partially decomposed and transformed which is not conducive to mn adsorption although these adsorbents achieved a certain effect in the removal of metal ions during amd treatment the mechanism of action and recycling of the adsorbents should be further explored according to the adsorption mechanism the methods can be divided into electrostatic exchange adsorption physical adsorption and chemical adsorption 84 based on the adsorption kinetics and thermodynamic models it can be inferred that the ph and temperature are key to the effective removal of metal ions they not only affect the morphology of metal ions but also affect the charge and interaction force of the adsorbent materials with the temperature influencing the heat of adsorption provided by the convective diffusion reaction 85 in one example when using a novel cfe ni nps adsorbent to remove 87 3 of the refractory toxic substance as v in an aqueous solution 86 the electrostatic repulsion between as v and the surface of cfe ni nps increased with increasing ph of the solution resulting in greater contact and interaction between the material surface and as similarly the isoelectric point of uio 66 ta was ph 4 4 when the ph exceeded 4 4 an increase in the oh concentration competes with the adsorption sites which is not conducive to metal adsorption 87 correspondingly chemical adsorption is a spontaneous endothermic process and the temperature is the main driving force for the endothermic process of physical adsorption 88 clinoptilolite has a large specific surface area and high ion exchange capacity pandey et al 89 embedded mos2 with a special structure in a clinoptilolite sheet which enlarged the pores increased the mobility of the pollutants at elevated temperatures and increased the surface activity thus increasing the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent the method can be characterized by its rapid reaction simple operation and lack of secondary pollution however the difficulty in adsorbent regeneration and the high adsorbent cost are some of the drawbacks the adsorption method is mostly suitable for removing cu2 zn2 and mn2 contained in wastewater and a large number of available natural materials or wastes from industries or agriculture can be used as cheap adsorbents as part of a low cost and economical treatment 4 2 3 ion exchange method the ion exchange method uses a resin polymer with exchangeable ions to exchange with the heavy metal ions of the same nature in the solution through convection and diffusion the heavy ions are replaced on the surface of the resin to form a macroporous matrix and then removed 90 91 this method is mostly used for the treatment and recovery of heavy metal ions such as cr3 cd cu and hg contained in wastewater commonly used ion exchange adsorption resin materials include natural and synthetic materials mainly fibers and resins based on the nature of the functional groups contained in the ion exchange resin they can be divided into seven categories strong acid weak acid strong base weak base chelation acid base amphoteric and redox type 92 table 4 presents the corresponding characteristics the main reaction mechanism is as follows 6 2rsh m2 rs 2m 2h where m is a divalent metal ion the affinity selectivity of heavy metal ions to the resin determines the exchange between the resin and heavy metal ions and ion exchangers of the same nature have different reaction mechanisms 93 a cation exchange resin exchanges with heavy metal ions based on the electrostatic force of the ionic bond and an anion exchanger mainly depends on whether it can form a complex the greater the affinity of the complex the heavier the metals it can adsorb weng et al 94 exploited the special affinity of 2d amorphous mos3 with a porous structure for heavy metals tetrathiomolybdate mos4 2 anions were firmly bound to the strong anion exchange resins by substituting chloride ions and quaternary amine r4 n and the adsorption capacities were in the order hg2 pb2 cu2 cd2 the same conclusion was obtained when amorphous molybdenum sulfide ion exchange resin s960 mos4 was prepared by chelating the dipyridinium group on the resin with mos4 2 when dipicolylamine resin with a macroporous structure from which is good reusability and large adsorption capacities 95 the method is mostly aimed at bivalent trivalent charge ionic large processing volume renewable resin and low secondary pollution it can effectively remove trace substances in the recovery solution however it is susceptible to the influence of wastewater quality heavy metal ion concentration water temperature and ph and other factors and is expensive 4 2 4 membrane separation method the membrane separation method uses a permselective membrane as the separation medium and utilizes the driving force such as the pressure difference concentration difference and potential difference existing on both sides of the membrane to separate the solvent from the solute or particle 96 based on the membrane pore size and the driving force the different methods include microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf as shown in fig 7 97 the membrane separation method is widely used to remove sulfate pb cr cd and other toxic substances contained in water the membrane separation method has high efficiency small footprint wide application and easy operation 98 however the membrane is prone to fouling this requires high quality of influent water and pretreatments including coagulation sedimentation filtration adsorption and disinfection can be typically used to improve water quality 4 2 4 1 microfiltration microfiltration mf membranes utilize the pressure difference as the driving force to intercept particles with a particle size between 0 05 and 4 μm in water it has a uniform porous membrane a uniform membrane pore size and a large structure however heavy metal ions cannot be directly intercepted and must undergo appropriate pretreatment such as oxidation reduction and adsorption which has high filtration precision fast filtration and low adsorption capacity it is mainly used in food and beverage medicine petrochemical and other fields 99 4 2 4 2 ultrafiltration ultrafiltration uf is a pressurized membrane separation technology and its membrane is a porous asymmetric structure under the action of external driving force pressure colloids particles and substances with relatively high molecular weights are retained in water through the pressure active membrane while water and small solute particles permeate the separation process of the membrane it is generally not used to treat heavy metal wastewater but is mostly used in food medicine industrial wastewater treatment high purity water preparation and biotechnology industries 100 101 4 2 4 3 reverse osmosis and nanofiltration before nanofiltration nf or reverse osmosis ro treatment mf or uf pretreatment is often required to remove suspended solids colloids small particles and microorganisms present in water 102 acceptable performance and high durability of ro membranes can be achieved simultaneously by improving feedwater quality 103 the ro is arranged more closely and meticulously through external pressure the metal ions are separated by the semipermeable membrane under the higher osmotic pressure than the dissolved solids in the wastewater thereby effectively removing the organic matter cod heavy metals and various inorganic salts the nf membrane method falls between the ro and uf methods in terms of effectiveness and has the characteristics of both the structure of the membrane is charged and its specific charging behavior is closely related to the interaction between the ph value of the solution and the state of charge of the solute it has a high flux under low pressure particularly for divalent and polyvalent metal ions with high selectivity 104 the ro method has good water permeability however it has a high retention rate to salts the nf method has a higher permeation flux than ro can retain multivalent ions and dissolved molecules at low pressures and temperatures and is mostly used to recover metal ions 105 based on the surface properties roughness contact angle and hydrophobicity and operating parameters solution ph feed concentration and applied pressure which affect the membrane performance the effects of three different nf membranes on the solution permeability and solute rejection were compared the results showed the following order ts80 nf270 nf90 the use of ts80 was not easily affected by the ph when the ph is lower than the isoelectric point iep where the membrane charge is zero the membrane becomes positively charged and can help maximize the concentration and recovery of high order metals 106 and the removal rate of all polyvalent cations can reach 95 in addition compared with nf90 nf270 showed a higher initial rejection rate with increasing pressure the maximum rejection efficiencies of nf90 for sulfate and ca2 were 99 7 and 99 0 respectively however it is unsuitable for high pressure applications 107 although the nf270 membrane is more prone to fouling during processing it has a higher permeate flux of 88 6 l h m2 14 as amd is an important source for various resources the membrane separation technology has been found to be an effective method for water recovery wang et al 108 and ryu et al 109 pretreated amd using direct contact membrane distillation dcmd respectively recovering 60 of the water reducing the flux by 22 and recovering 80 of high quality water for reuse masindi et al 63 applied reverse osmosis systems to produce drinking water from amd while meeting the south african national standards sans 241 and specifications the membrane treatment technology is currently the main method used to recover clean water while meeting the requirements of domestic production mining operations and agricultural irrigation fig 8 shows the main utilization direction this fundamentally makes up for part of the investment cost and realizes resource utilization the stability of the membrane is key to the successful implementation of this technology although the nf method shows a good effect membrane surface fouling limits its performance the membrane surface is easily fouled to form gypsum scaling which limits the permeability of the membrane and the ability to recover water and concentrate metals 110 membrane fouling can be reduced by chemical cleaning which increases the permeability but reduces ion rejection 111 while developing new membrane materials such as nf270 coated with zinc oxide zno can change the characteristics of membrane roughness ipe so that the permeate flux of the coated membrane can be slightly increased which will show better fouling resistance and even degrade membrane surface contaminants zou et al 112 and wang et al 113 used plasma polymerization to modify the surface of an ro membrane to reduce the contact angle from 32 to 7 hyperbranched polyethyleneimine pei was modified to form positively charged polyamide pa nf membranes and the surface charge was changed from negative to positive resulting in enhanced membrane hydrophilicity and increased permeation flux thus significantly improving the anti fouling performance of the membrane and reducing organic pollution although it has produced satisfactory results it is still in the laboratory experimental stage and not yet applied to actual operation 4 2 5 microbiological method the microbiological method is based on the use of sulfate reducing bacteria srb under aerobic facultative and strictly anaerobic conditions 114 with a substrate as the carbon and energy source and sulfate caco3 nh4cl and other salts as terminal electron acceptors 115 and energy is obtained through dissimilation to reduce sulfate by srb the process includes decomposition stage electron transfer stage and oxidation stage as shown in fig 9 and so4 2 is reduced to s2 s2 and metal ions in the wastewater form less soluble sulfide and alkaline precipitates and neutralize the acidity of the wastewater thereby removing the metal ions 116 typically metal sulfide precipitates are stabler than metal hydroxides because they tend to form colloidal particles the method has a simple operation process and can recover elemental sulfur or sulfide the main reaction mechanism is as follows 117 7 organic matter microorganism hco 3 e atp 8 8h 8e so4 2 s2 4h2o 9 s2 2h h2s 10 s2 m2 ms 11 2oh m2 m oh 2 here m is a divalent metal ion common carbon sources include formic acid ph 5 6 acetic acid ph 7 5 8 5 ethanol ph 6 and lactic acid ph 4 118 however they are expensive and it is necessary to find alternative low cost carbon sources common agricultural wastes such as activated sludge animal manure straw straw or soluble metal solutions can be used as carbon sources for srb 119 neculita 120 used commercial sugar cane and 99 sucrose as the carbon source to enhance the removal of free cyanide from wastewater generated in a gold mine in major sugarcane processing countries such as china thailand and pakistan sugarcane processing wastewater can be removed simultaneously along with amd 121 dovorogwa et al 122 used tobacco waste as a carbon source to raise the ph value of acidic wastewater and successfully removed 90 of iron and zinc metals in another study organic rich industrial agricultural and domestic effluents were used as electron donors for the srb treatment of amd to selectively recover metals 123 under a suitable carbon source there is a certain relationship between the carbon source donor and bacteria the carbon source and electron donor directly affect the catabolism ability of srb and provide the donor required to maintain the microbial community the inherent microbial acidophilic heterotrophic bacteria sulfur oxidizing bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria methanogens and acetyl producing bacteria 124 interact with parameters such as heavy metals ph value and hydraulic retention time hrt associated with wastewater the heavy metals and microbial communities in the wastewater show an evident negative correlation the ph value not only affects the solubility of hydroxides and carbonates but also affects the hydrolysis and precipitation processes a shorter hrt does not allow sufficient time for the srb activity to neutralize the acidity and precipitate metals while longer retention times may lead to the depletion of available organic or sulfate sources for srbs and the temperature severely affects srb growth and sulfate reduction 125 126 studies show that the optimum temperature for srb growth is in the range of 28 38 c the activity of srb technology is easily inhibited by the toxicity of metabolites such as s2 thus reducing the treatment efficiency of its wastewater and the generated h2s gas will poison plants the low ph and high heavy metal concentration of acid mine wastewater will seriously affect the activity and growth of microorganisms such as srb 127 table 5 presents several analysis studies although this method is highly efficient economical and environmentally friendly it is significantly affected by the properties of amd and system operating parameters it is mostly applicable to abandoned mine water and mine water and is unsuitable under cold weather conditions it is significantly affected by the properties of amd and system operating parameters making it difficult to continue to find low cost and reliable new carbon sources and new electron donors and domesticated srb that are resistant to low temperature and low ph value at the present stage it can be the focus of future development 4 2 6 constructed wetland method constructed wetlands are mainly composed of substrates aquatic plants and microorganisms as shown in fig 10 the filtration and adsorption physical effects of soil walnut shell gravel and other material substrates are used to intercept and deposit suspended solids on substrates 131 under the carbon source and electron donor provided by the substrate the metal ions are precipitated by the chemical biological action of hydrolysis oxidation ion exchange and reduction through microbial transformation absorption and complexation by the roots of aquatic plants 132 the intensity and effect of its action mainly depend on the substrate vegetation types and microbial species this method has low investment low operating cost ease of management and high removal efficiency the main treatment mechanism for acid mine water can be summarized into three aspects 1 chemical biological oxidation and hydrolysis of metal ions in the presence of aerobic microorganisms 2 adsorption of metals by soil matrix plants and algae and 3 sulfate reduction by anaerobic bacteria in the presence of anaerobic microorganisms 133 134 12 2ch2o so4 2 hs 2hco3 h 13 2ch2o so4 2 2h h2s 2h2o 2co2 14 m2 h2s ms2 2h here ch2o is organic matter constructed wetlands can be used for a variety of wastewater treatments including industrial agricultural construction domestic water and other fields and it is a research hotspot for amd treatment as shown in table 6 based on plant growth conditions and water surface flow it can include aerobic cws anaerobic cws surface flow cws subsurface horizontal flow cws and vertical flow cws the corresponding characteristics are shown in the table in this process the matrix accounted for 49 7 82 5 of the metal removal pathway followed by plant absorption 16 1 39 0 and other processes 0 6 3 2 135 thus the substrate medium and vegetation type are key factors affecting the removal effect by comparing and analyzing the other influencing factors it has been generally proven that steel slag calcite and ceramsite work better as the matrix than gravel 136 cattail and reed are the best aquatic plants 137 their roots are more developed they have stronger oxygen transport capacity and the removal performance of heavy metals is the best through root absorption as for amd produced in yangquan mine in shanxi province phragmites australis and typha orientalis showed the best adsorption performance for mn and zn metals 138 a change in the substrate changes its own adsorption performance and the transformation of microorganisms rwa et al 139 took three types of mine waste coal gangue iron ore and manganese ore and used substrates showing different reflection forms changing the microbial community structure and diversity promoting the growth of wetland plants and further improving the metabolic capacity and nutrient adsorption capacity of the microorganisms external addition of domestic wastewater dw and plant litter broth plb as organic matrix carbon sources can promote microbial flora growth promote sulfate reduction activity and achieve effective removal of metals 132 table 7 presents more applications the entire process also depends on the type and characteristics of wastewater geographical location and other factors which may require the cultivation of multiple varieties of plants both constructed wetland and microbial method are easily affected by the environment and have high requirements on influent water quality processing takes longer than other methods the removal efficiency of many species affected by seasons is better in summer than in winter moreover it covers a large area and is unsuitable for areas with high perennial rainfall 4 3 recovery of rare earth elements amd is the main secondary source of rare earth elements rees 149 mainly light medium and heavy elements such as la ce pr nd eu dy and tb in recent years as an important strategic resource for many countries in the world rees have attracted global attention they have been widely used in petroleum chemical automobile battery and electronic fields as well as in renewable energy medicine and other fields in china it is also used as an agricultural fertilizer the world s ree reserves are mainly located in china brazil vietnam russia and india with china holding nearly half of the world s known ree reserves accounting for approximately 63 of global production 150 large amounts of rees are found in coal mine drainage in many countries such as coal mine drainage in illinois coal basin acid mine drainage in saint lucia mine cuba and acid pit lake in wisniowka mine south central poland 151 153 due to the uneven global resource reserves and the continuous development of advanced science and technology relying on ree materials the demand for rees is increasing thus stimulating the development of ree recycling technologies hence it is important to recover amd wastewater to reduce environmental pollution and cover the costs associated with post treatment in coal mining production in an amd system rees mainly exist in the form of cations and the common precipitation membrane separation and ion exchange technologies show a good recovery performance felipe et al 154 and luciano et al 155 used lewatit mds 200h dowex 50w40 resin and strong acid cationic resin to synthesize polymer resin lewatit mds 200h for uranium mine in brazil light rees were obtained showing a strong affinity for light rees the selectivity of the resin for rees is in the order light rare earth heavy rare earth the loading capacity of la was approximately 0 940 mmol g 1 and the efficiency was 85 ca and mg were separated from ree in 0 02 mol l 1 nh4edta solution with a low concentration and long residence time after elution a concentrate containing 39 0 mmol l 1 ree was obtained the efficiency was 89 in amd the presence of ph and other ions affects the recovery process of ree lópez et al 156 verified the possibility of ree recovery using a nanofiltration membrane the nanofiltration membrane polyamide membrane desal dl and semi aromatic polyamide nanofiltration membrane nf270 with positive surface charges can improve the membrane performance at ph 1 1 5 or 1 5 3 wang et al 157 recovered rees from amd containing ca al mn fe and mg using oxalic acid a common industrial precipitator with a strong affinity for rees in strongly acidic solutions at ph 1 5 2 reaction times of 2 h and oxalic acid dose in the range of 30 40 g l the ree recovery for individual ree species could be optimized from 95 to nearly 100 the recovery tends to be stable with increasing ph while ca and al in the water consume oxalic acid in turn when the dosage is excessive li et al 158 noted that h2o2 can improve the removal rate of rees thus it shows stronger adsorption and removal ability for rees however in the presence of aluminum ions the removal of rees by iron precipitation is reduced due to charge neutralization and competitive adsorption effects caused by aluminum species considering the environmental impact chemical consumption and cost the two step na2co3 process was used to treat amd with this process al at a concentration of 30 wt was precipitated by 90 in the first step ph 5 and rees at a concentration of 1 6 in the second step ph 7 a recovery of 85 159 since rees contain radioactive elements and can exist in water and soil long term exposure will cause irreversible harm to human health and the ecological environment recycling rees from second hand sources of amd can not only make up for the economic cost but also reduce the negative effects on the environment and human health due to ree exposure 5 synergistic technology there are many types of active and passive treatment technologies considering the composition of the amd the environment ph value and treatment cost using only one of them is associated with significant disadvantages for example it is difficult to recover valuable metals from sludge precipitation the constructed wetland method has high requirements on influent ph the adsorbent cannot easily settle in water although the membrane technology can produce high quality water it is difficult to achieve resource recovery and it is an ineffective means for treating sulfate and heavy metal ions therefore many studies have synergized two or more technologies for an efficient removal of sulfate and efficient recovery of useful heavy metals 5 1 application of synergistic technology markovic et al 160 combined neutralization precipitation with organic adsorption for amd in copper mining areas in southeastern serbia after two steps of precipitation 99 fe and cu were removed at ph 4 and 7 respectively and chitosan was added to remove mn when ph 6 5 selectively separating iron and copper from wastewater and helping recover iron and copper ions nguegang et al 161 coordinated the neutralization method with the constructed wetland using mgo nps to neutralize and precipitate some heavy metals and weaken the effect of toxic chemicals so as to improve the water intake level of the constructed wetland since then the advantages of the different technologies were further utilized to purify water forming a positive effect effectively removing sulfate and metal ions from water and meeting the wastewater discharge standards with removal rate of fe 99 8 al 99 5 mn 99 24 zn 98 36 cu 97 38 ni 97 7 so4 2 80 59 however this approach does not consider the sludge processing problems jin et al 162 used microbial heterotrophic acidophilus bimineralization to reduce iron oxide and sulfate in advance which reduced the amount of lime required for subsequent alkaline neutralization by 56 and gypsum precipitation by 68 and increased the removed al mn cu ni and zn content by 3 2 times the cost could be significantly reduced and a new sustainable treatment method was proposed most of these technologies have focused primarily on removing amd s own acidity metal and sulfate content and have failed to adequately recover and reuse the valuable components in amd sustainability and cost remain major challenges in this process 163 thus the focus of attention has shifted to amd resource recycling 5 2 recovery of metals metal ions such as copper iron and zinc present in amd have high recovery economic value and are an important part of industries such as electrical conductors metal equipment building materials and industrial facilities recycling valuable metals from amd and converting them into products or raw materials can reduce investment costs and environmental pollution with the development of technology membrane separation chemical oxidation electrochemistry selective precipitation and solvent extraction have been widely used to recover metal ions from amd table 8 lists the heavy metal recovery technologies adopted for amd the recovered heavy metals can not only become fe2o3 magnetite and gypsum products but also can be used as raw materials to treat wastewater tony et al 170 recovered iron from acid mine drainage to prepare iron coated sand as the fenton source and used fenton reaction to treat organic matter in polymer industrial wastewater muedi et al 171 utilized polycationic di metallic fe al pdfe al adsorbent formed by precipitation to remove the harmful heavy metal cr6 from amd to achieve a removal efficiency of 95 mwewa et al 172 obtained precipitates formed by 89 5 fe and 10 0 al recovered from amd at ph 5 0 to form polyaluminum ferric sulfate amd pafs and transformed them into coagulants to treat beer wastewater which reduced the volume of precipitated sludge by 95 0 and fully covered the treatment cost based on the data analysis selective precipitation is still a common technical means for metal recovery owing to its low cost and high recovery rate the dabaoshan open pit copper mine in guangdong generates approximately 15 000 m3 day of amd and the heavy metal content has exceeded the limit set by china national standard for drinking water in 2010 a chemical precipitation amd processing plant with a capacity of 15 000 m3 d was built downstream the sludge volume reached 100 tons day and the problem of sludge sedimentation and cost effectiveness was solved by adopting the phase precipitation process and the sediment refining process as shown in fig 11 first 0 15 ml l of 30 h2o2 was oxidized and the selective addition of ca oh 2 and na2s solution was used for four step fractional precipitation with the ph controlled in the range of 3 5 4 0 fe was first precipitated at ph 8 5 mn and all other heavy metals were precipitated the fe cu zn and mn contents in the specific sludge were 45 91 11 58 31 06 and 7 95 respectively the recovery efficiencies of fe cu zn and mn from amd reached 99 51 86 09 87 87 and 79 71 respectively after the manganese precipitation process the metal contained in the effluent was below the federal regulation cfr limit the fe2o3 content after roasting can be used in the coating industry while copper and zinc sludge were refined into copper and zinc concentrate by the flotation process manganese slag can also replace 45 ordinary portland cement opc in cement materials 173 the benefits of successfully recovering metals more than compensate for the investment costs of the chemicals used 6 conclusions the extensiveness complexity toxicity and persistence of amd make it one of the main threats to the sustainable advancement of the mining industry in terms of reliable and safe production taking strong technical measures for treatment and recovery depending on the geographical location of mines coal and rock occurrences and hydrological and mining conditions should be the main research directions going forward this study analyzed the composition of amd and summarized the basic principles of prevention and treatment technologies the applications of the neutralization precipitation method adsorption method ion exchange method membrane separation method and microbial and constructed wetland method were evaluated and the possibility of resource recovery was analyzed the key differences between the various technologies and their and applicability were identified the main conclusions of the study are as follows the acid mine wastewater produced in the mining of sulfur containing coal mines contains extremely corrosive so4 2 ions and toxic heavy metal ions directly discharging the wastewater without strict treatment can harm the ecological environment and pose a direct threat to human life when source prevention and control measures such as isolation and plugging fungicide delivery and accelerated drainage involve a wide range of environmental factors the actual operation is difficult lacking stability and sustainability and making it difficult for them to become an effective control means the final treatment technology is currently the main means of amd treatment in this approach physical chemical and biological methods are employed to remove sulfates heavy metals and other pollutants this is an effective method for the resource recovery of water and rees the precipitation process of the active technology is simple and is the main means to remove pollutants and recover metals and rees although the recovery of resources makes up for part of the cost the post treatment of the sludge by products remains a technical drawback the adsorption method is relatively economical and the reaction is fast however the selection of the adsorbent is important the ion exchange method and the membrane separation method have strong targeting high removal efficiency and are suitable for the recovery of rees and water resources respectively however the membrane change problem causing membrane pollution remains a technical difficulty although the automatic treatment technologies of microbial and constructed wetland method for secondary pollution are at a small scale the removal effect is good though the investment cost is high and the methods are affected by water conditions and the natural environment any single final treatment technology cannot meet the treatment requirements and emission standards under all environmental conditions the synergistic technology combines the complementary advantages of the two technologies to achieve a metal removal rate of nearly 100 and an efficient recovery of cu zn fe and other metal ions by 70 the application of oxidation synergistic fractional precipitation to dabaoshan mine in china reflects the considerable economic benefits that is a sustainable development of the entire system through cost compensation future directions can be convenient joint operation low secondary pollution cost effectiveness and environmentally friendly technical collaboration to achieve a high removal efficiency of sulfate and metal ions and high recovery of valuable metals and rees abbreviations amd acid

environment and human health hence the effective management of amd has become a global concern by reviewing the formation mechanism hazards and composition characteristics of acid mine wastewater this study analyzed the control methods and treatment technologies that can be used for source prevention and control and finally effective governance the reaction mechanism and advantages and disadvantages of several treatment techniques including the commonly used active and passive treatments were discussed in depth and the applicability of the various technologies was evaluated our findings showed that solely relying on a single technology cannot meet the emission standards and industrial requirements for the recycling of resources including water resources valuable metals and rare earth elements according to the principle of complementary advantages an improved treatment method involving a collaborative technology was proposed to improve the removal efficiency of pollutants and resource recovery of valuable metals so as to realize a sustainable treatment of amd the predicted synergistic technology will be the main direction for future exploration and development graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords acid mine drainage source prevention final governance synergy resource recovery data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the strategic position of coal in china s energy structure has remained unchanged and coal continues to be the main source of energy according to the china sustainable energy development strategy by 2050 the contribution of coal to china s energy output will not be 50 1 the continuous mining and processing of coal resources is accompanied by the discharge of a large amount of mine wastewater according to statistics approximately two tons of mine water is produced for every one ton of coal mined currently approximately 8 billion tons of mine water is generated considering the average annual output of coal in china and the utilization of mine water is just under 25 2 most of the mines are located in arid areas with scarce water resources particularly in the northwest region where the climate is dry all year round and water resources are in serious shortage moreover the untreated sewage from coal mining and the consumption and wastage of water in the various links of mining areas pollute the existing water resources and destroy the water resource ecosystem under the long term interaction between coal bearing strata and groundwater particularly in highsulfur coal mining areas with large amounts of hematite and pyrite exposed acid mine drainage amd is easily formed as shown in fig 1 3 4 acid mine water contains sulfuric acid fe2 fe3 mn2 etc may also be enriched with some traces of toxic substances and has the characteristics of high corrosiveness high salinity and high sulfate content 5 6 almost all major coal producing countries in the world including the united states australia canada and china have serious acid mine water problems it is estimated that tens of thousands of mines around the world generate amd 7 the direct discharge of acid mine water without any advanced treatment will cause significant harm to both human life and the ecology owing to environmental protection and economic considerations various source prevention and control and final treatment technologies have emerged it is difficult to realize source prevention in practical operation and terminal treatment technologies such as active and passive treatments have been most effective the investment cost of an amd treatment technology ranges from several hundred dollars to hundreds of millions of dollars 8 with the strict discharge standards for relevant environmental sewage introduced by various countries to ensure the sustainable development of coal resources the recycling of available resources such as water metals and rare earth elements from amd is promoted to reduce economic costs or to improve the removal rate of heavy metals and salts in a collaborative manner however the selection of these technologies depends on the mineralogical characteristics of the mine geographical conditions weather and other factors 9 there is no uniformly applicable standard for any technology the applicability of each technology is unclear and the selection of the technology lacks a scientific basis therefore this paper analyzes the formation mechanism hazard and composition characteristics of amd and studies the control methods and treatment technologies for source prevention and control and terminal treatment 2 formation and dangers of acid mine drainage 2 1 formation of acid mine drainage the main sources of amd are not only mine water generated via the oxidation reaction in the mining process but also process drainage surface infiltration water and underground infiltration water 10 11 these are respectively from wastewater discharged during coal washing flotation and clean coal extraction infiltration water formed by atmospheric precipitation weathering of coal gangue piles and surface water runoff groundwater leakage from the leaching of waste ore piles tailings ponds and backfill areas 12 with the characteristics of large water volume scattered water sources and long duration fig 2 shows the production model of amd pollution amd refers to mine water with ph 5 5 which is mostly produced in the mining of metal and sulfide ores with sulfur content 1 5 13 coal mining activities change the reducing environment of groundwater flowing through coal seams and surrounding rocks into an oxidizing environment causing the pyrite fes2 to oxidize and further undergo hydrolysis under the action of thiobacillus ferrogenes generating sulfates and free sulfuric acid and reducing the ph of the mine water to make it acidic 14 at the same time fe3 oxidizes fes2 accompanied by the production of large amounts of so4 2 fe2 fe3 mn2 pb2 zn2 and cr3 plasma the main reactions are expressed in eqs 1 3 15 17 1 chemical oxidation the initial oxidation reaction of sulfide resulting in sulfate and free sulfuric acid 1 2fes2 7o2 2h2o 2feso4 2h2so4 2 microbial oxidation fe2 is unstable and further oxidizes to generate insoluble fe2 so4 3 2 4feso4 2h2so4 o2 2fe2 so4 3 2h2o 3 hydrolysis the hydrolysis reaction of fe2 so4 3 in weakly acidic water to generate free sulfuric acid and fe oh 3 3 fe2 so4 3 6h2o 2fe oh 3 3h2so4 4 oxidation of fes2 by fe3 in a solution with ph 3 the rate of pyrite oxidation by fe3 is 10 100 times that of oxygen 4 fes2 7fe2 so4 3 8h2o 15feso4 8h2so4 when the alkaline minerals in the coal seam and surrounding rock are insufficient to neutralize the sulfuric acid the wastewater will be acidic the reaction formula shows that there are differences in the physical and chemical properties of acid mine water in different environments under the coexistence of oxygen water and fungi the oxidation rate of fes2 is accelerated and acid wastewater is continuously produced 2 2 dangers of acid mine drainage the pyrite exposed to the oxidizing environment of air and water undergoes physical chemical and biological reactions to generate amd which accumulates and develops in the coal seam voids fissures and dissolved fissures in addition after the coal seam mining is completed the sealed underground goafs abandoned mines etc are prone to accumulate acidic old kiln water producing metal ions and sulfuric acid 18 which can last for decades and are extremely corrosive and soluble once these elements circulate with the groundwater the combined action will further exacerbate the effect of amd discharge on coal mining production space natural ecological environment and human health 19 20 1 production equipment amd is highly corrosive when it passes through steel materials such as drainage pipes mining devices and transportation devices corrosion will occur destroying the surface structure of the equipment and affecting its working efficiency and service life 21 2 water body and soil fe oh 3 produced by the oxidation of fe2 in the amd makes the water yellow brown and it is directly discharged into rivers lakes reservoirs etc which seriously deteriorate the water quality and inhibit the growth of aquatic organisms which may even go extinct and the ecological balance will be destroyed 22 when flowing through the soil it will deplete the soil cause the acid base imbalance of the soil affect the growth function of plants and crops and reduce the crop yield and biodiversity 23 3 human health the corrosiveness and harmfulness of amd seriously affect the health of miners exposed to long term direct contact causing skin burns sensory discomfort breathing difficulties and other adverse symptoms once in the food chain it indirectly causes health issues such as diarrhea 24 25 3 composition characteristics of acid mine drainage amd can be characterized by its wide range of sources large discharge wide coverage and complex composition under the action of oxidation and bacterial decomposition of high sulfur ores the dissolution of metal ions in minerals produces sulfates and metal precipitation substances including many anions and cations e g the most common and most concentrated so4 2 intermediate and large amounts of fe2 fe3 al3 and h as well as ca2 mg2 and cl originally contained in groundwater mn2 associated with coal seams and small amounts of cu2 zn2 pb2 cr3 cd2 and other toxic heavy metal ions dissolved in water in the surrounding rock 26 due to the difference in the compositions of coal seam rocks the characteristics of the components contained in the wastewater change accordingly 27 these are located at the edge of the area and the wastewater seriously threatens the quality of the water source and surface water environment in the nearby watershed table 1 presents the main composition distribution of typical coal mines in china some heavy metal ions in wastewater are highly toxic and do not biodegrade in nature instead they gradually accumulate and increase in concentration causing chronic and long term damage to human life and the ecology 1 the concentration of iron ions is typically much higher than those of other metal ions iron is the main trace element necessary for the human body however excess iron intake damages cells and affects the normal functioning of the human heart 2 the content of al3 is typically lower than that of iron ions and excess accumulation can cause mental retardation in children memory loss in middle aged people and dementia in the elderly 13 3 the content of so4 2 is relatively high most of which come from the oxidation of pyrite or the dissolution of sedimentary rocks containing sulfate minerals and the infiltration of surface water into the ground so4 2 is extremely corrosive according to the groundwater quality standard the sulfate discharge standard is 250 mg l 1 4 the concentration of mn2 is low mn2 has an unpleasant odor can poison animals and plants damage the human central nervous system and even cause cancer 37 5 cu2 mainly comes from copper bearing ores it has strong biocidal activity which significantly affects ecosystems and the harmfulness of copper in terms of its high concentration and high solubility makes it the main object of treatment and recovery 6 zn is easily soluble in acidic solutions and has low toxicity therefore it can reduce the immune function of the human body and cause zinc poisoning when in excess it is also a recyclable metal 7 ca2 and mg2 are widely distributed mainly produced by the dissolution of carbonate sedimentary rocks the two are found in high concentrations are relatively less harmful and have an ideal removal effect 8 pb2 is a toxic heavy metal that is difficult to remove after entering the human body it can cause congenital brain damage 38 9 although the content of cr3 is low it is highly toxic and must be removed using appropriate treatment techniques if it enters the body it can cause respiratory diseases abdominal lesions and mental disorders and 10 cd2 is one of the five poisonous substances in heavy metals it is highly toxic and stable and its absorption by the human body can cause cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and renal dysfunction 4 treatment technologies for acid mine drainage coal mining activities inevitably produce amd the amd is complex and diverse in composition pollutes over a large area and is difficult to control and manage referring to china s sewage discharge guidelines combined with the actual situation of water resource utilization in china it is necessary to vigorously promote the optimization of acid mine water control and treatment technology to achieve treatment objectives 1 supporting unified sustainable treatment technology 2 water resource recycling optimized allocation and 3 economical safe and efficient in the current research stage the technologies used to treat amd can be divided into source prevention and final treatment technology based on the degree of operability and the advantages and disadvantages of the treatment the final treatment is the mainstream technical means today 39 40 4 1 source prevention of acid mine drainage in a coal mining environment there are often spatial conditions for the formation of acidic wastewater the source of water filling is constantly gurgling the water filling paths are widely distributed the water filling intensity is difficult to estimate and the affected factors are complex including coal seam occurrence conditions hydrogeological conditions material composition of surrounding rock and mining path methods therefore source control is associated with many challenges and is difficult to achieve 41 considering the occurrence space of high sulfur coal and the layout of the oxidizing environment where water and oxygen coexist source prevention can be summarized into five principles namely prevention blocking dredging drainage and control which can be roughly divided into the following six aspects as shown in fig 3 1 performing ground waterproofing and applying surface coating to reduce atmospheric precipitation and surface water filling sources 42 preventing rainwater ice and snow rivers lakes oceans and other forms of water from infiltrating into sulfur bearing coal rock formations or using dry or water mulch to insulate waste rock or tailings from oxygen as much as possible to reduce the water rich and oxygen rich environment required for sulfide oxidation however this is inapplicable to areas where annual evaporation is greater than the precipitation and to large areas affected by rain snow and ice weather therefore practical operation is difficult 2 implementing grouting plugging for the mine water that may be filled with water and flow through the path for grouting and plugging and injecting clay mortar etc to reinforce isolate and block water flow in the channel 43 in practical application it is difficult to achieve accurate tracking and there are still formation conditions the symptoms are being treated rather than the root cause 3 to shorten the residence time of mine water the amd mainly comes from the oxidation of high sulfur ore in the coal seam and the sulfur containing substances of the coal itself in an oxidative environment such as water filled coal seams and surrounding rocks 44 particularly in the goaf where underground water has been soaked for a long time the amd is constantly flowing it is necessary to accelerate the drainage speed of the mine water and shorten the path of the mine water flowing through the coal seam 4 placing bacteriostatic agents and bactericides in the old kiln water sealed in goafs or abandoned roadways 45 by adding appropriate amounts of bacteriostatic agents to reduce the number and activity of microorganisms in mine water the biological oxidation of pyrite can be reduced bactericides can not only quickly kill microorganisms such as thiobacillus ferrogenes but also break the microbial growth environment and produce bacterial resistant microorganisms affecting the growth of aquatic phytoplankton 5 separating water discharge for non acid mine water discharge to exclusive recovery wells avoid mixing with amd thereby reducing the wastewater treatment volume and decreasing costs 6 coal gangue planning and management the coal gangue in the discharge site after beneficiation should be treated as water proof as possible to prevent the acid reclaimed water after the reaction of residual sulfide with water from seeping and moving to the coal rock formation which would increase the formation of amd or pollute the soil and water body by leakage although the amount of acidic wastewater produced in this way is small it is difficult to effectively prevent and control the underlying gangue 4 2 final treatment of acid mine drainage based on the type of technology the final treatment technology for amd can be divided into two types active and passive treatment technologies 46 47 active technology is a treatment using external energy or relying on chemical reactions mainly including neutralization precipitation adsorption ion exchange and membrane separation 48 involving precipitation sulfate reduction and ion exchange absorption filtration these are mostly used for the treatment of amd with medium to high flow and high acidity passive technology relies on natural media or materials and naturally occurring chemical and biological processes 49 common methods include the use of microbial sulfate reducing flora and the construction of artificial wetlands for low flow and low acidity environments 50 51 fig 4 shows common technical classifications the active treatment system is continuous and the technical effect is better the passive treatment method does not require continuous input of chemical reagents and the secondary pollution waste generated is less and the impact on the environment is lower 4 2 1 neutralization precipitation method the neutralization precipitation method is a common treatment method 52 fig 5 shows the process flow this method adjusts the ph value of amd by adding alkaline substances and using acid base neutralization reaction the ph is increased to the ph value required for heavy metal precipitation 53 54 metal ions in the amd are formed into insoluble hydroxide precipitates and removed from wastewater 53 commonly used neutralizers include quicklime cao limestone caco3 slaked lime ca oh 2 soda ash na2co3 and caustic soda naoh 55 table 2 presents the performance of five neutralizers 56 58 the main reaction mechanism is as follows ca oh 2 for example 5 m2 so4 2 ca oh 2 2h2o m oh 2 caso4 2h2o where m is a divalent metal ion however due to the poor solubility of gypsum generated by the solvent only part of the sulfate can be removed the magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 can produce higher ph value resulting in faster settling of metal precipitates and higher sludge density which also requires a larger sludge treatment space the method is simple in terms of the process and convenient in terms of operation however disadvantages include the large amount of sludge and other precipitation by product residues which can easily cause equipment blockage and increase the cost of secondary pollution treatment 59 60 sibrell and watten 61 showed that the neutralization of 50 metric tons of amd produces 450 metric tons of sludge at a high disposal cost of us 40 m2 in recent years with the consideration of economic cost ease of operation and high efficiency alkaline neutralizers have been gradually replaced by the recovery and utilization of by products such as lime charcoal ash slag or fly ash produced by the combustion of alkaline substances with comparable performance 62 63 these neutralizers can effectively neutralize amd efficiently treat sulfate and heavy metals and remove 99 of aluminum arsenic cadmium cobalt copper iron and manganese and approximately 50 60 of sulfate contained in wastewater amd 64 65 kaur et al 47 used industrially refined aluminum slag to form a bayer liquid alkaline waste to achieve the same substitution effect exhibiting a high mn removal rate at a low ph and with a stronger mn removal ability than lime ca oh 2 emma tuulia et al 65 removed 99 of aluminum arsenic cadmium cobalt copper iron and manganese from amd wastewater discharged in a copper zinc mine using coke lime byproducts generated in the production of quick lime the same amount of sludge was produced and approximately 50 60 of the same amount of sulfate could be removed under the treatment of quick lime and hydrated lime this helped save the cost of the chemicals used a slag matrix polymer based on a high porosity can achieve an initial sulfate removal efficiency of up to 99 and the amount of by product sludge produced is small and stable the subsequent treatment is convenient 66 kefeni et al 67 demonstrated that extremely clean nanoparticle charcoal ash has dual functions of adsorption and precipitation which can achieve the same considerable removal effect and a higher economic value the precipitation method is the most commonly used method that has been applied to mine water or tailings wastewater long term dynamic generation of amd requires that the method must be continuously applied for decades or even centuries until the formation of amd stops making it unsustainable in the long run 4 2 2 adsorption method the adsorption technology is faster than the precipitation method and is easy to operate it uses a porous solid substance with a large specific surface area to adsorb the metal ions in wastewater to concentrate the pollutants on its surface based on the change in the active functional groups and ion valency the metal ions are removed 68 the adsorbent is the focus of application commonly used adsorbents include natural materials such as zeolite sludge activated carbon bentonite wood ash and chitosan 69 70 and industrial by products such as slag sawdust manure and coal ash 71 72 table 3 presents the common applications these more commonly used conventional adsorbents such as activated carbon have a high adsorption capacity and a large specific surface area however they are relatively expensive and regeneration is difficult in comparison natural bentonite and zeolite have a good adsorption capacity though their adsorption performance is limited and are difficult to separate chitosan comes from a wide range of sources but is unsuitable for low ph conditions 77 carbon steel slag css is inexpensive can be used repeatedly and has a strong sulfate removal ability but is limited to small particle sizes in recent years the research focus has shifted to the use of new technology to prepare and develop new environmentally friendly efficient and economical adsorbents as the technology develops through carbonization activation or organic modification techniques to change the structure of functional groups or expand the pores the surface area for adsorbent materials can be increased biochar as a new material is widely used in the field of soil remediation and wastewater purification organic materials such as sludge feces wood and straw are used for hydrothermal carbonization or pyrolysis to form a pore structure based on fixed carbon fig 6 78 the formed active sites and major functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and benzene ring adsorb the heavy metal ions in amd 79 this facilitates the direct adsorption on large surface areas by charge or covalent interaction achieving a slight increase in ph and efficient removal of sulfate and metal ions yang et al 80 reported that surface biochar can also effectively improve the ph value of amd reduce the biological dissolution of chalcopyrite and thus reduce the release of copper and iron ions however such an inhibition effect is not common and the inhibition conditions required for different types of amd are different therefore there is no uniform adaptation condition in addition most studies are limited to single ion removal at a small scale and some of them are in the laboratory stage without large scale or engineering application research chindaprasirt et al 81 used fly ash and bottom ash to synthesize porous alkali activated materials aams with a large specific surface area and a large number of active adsorption sites can be synthesized which are more active than the porous structures this favors the distribution of metals on its surface owing to the heterogeneity the presence of irregular fractures and the rough structure of the biological mixture which promote the adsorption and are cheap shi et al 82 crosslinked chitosan cs and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose cmc to produce an organic copolymer film cc to organically modify magnetic alkaline calcium bentonite macb the macb cc formed exhibited a greater number of adsorption sites and better recycling performance after five cycles of desorption the adsorption rate of copper and manganese could still reach 90 this preparation method is simple and cost effective li et al 83 used an industrial by product namely red mud to remove mn ions from wastewater and found that the active groups in modified raw red mud were partially decomposed and transformed which is not conducive to mn adsorption although these adsorbents achieved a certain effect in the removal of metal ions during amd treatment the mechanism of action and recycling of the adsorbents should be further explored according to the adsorption mechanism the methods can be divided into electrostatic exchange adsorption physical adsorption and chemical adsorption 84 based on the adsorption kinetics and thermodynamic models it can be inferred that the ph and temperature are key to the effective removal of metal ions they not only affect the morphology of metal ions but also affect the charge and interaction force of the adsorbent materials with the temperature influencing the heat of adsorption provided by the convective diffusion reaction 85 in one example when using a novel cfe ni nps adsorbent to remove 87 3 of the refractory toxic substance as v in an aqueous solution 86 the electrostatic repulsion between as v and the surface of cfe ni nps increased with increasing ph of the solution resulting in greater contact and interaction between the material surface and as similarly the isoelectric point of uio 66 ta was ph 4 4 when the ph exceeded 4 4 an increase in the oh concentration competes with the adsorption sites which is not conducive to metal adsorption 87 correspondingly chemical adsorption is a spontaneous endothermic process and the temperature is the main driving force for the endothermic process of physical adsorption 88 clinoptilolite has a large specific surface area and high ion exchange capacity pandey et al 89 embedded mos2 with a special structure in a clinoptilolite sheet which enlarged the pores increased the mobility of the pollutants at elevated temperatures and increased the surface activity thus increasing the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent the method can be characterized by its rapid reaction simple operation and lack of secondary pollution however the difficulty in adsorbent regeneration and the high adsorbent cost are some of the drawbacks the adsorption method is mostly suitable for removing cu2 zn2 and mn2 contained in wastewater and a large number of available natural materials or wastes from industries or agriculture can be used as cheap adsorbents as part of a low cost and economical treatment 4 2 3 ion exchange method the ion exchange method uses a resin polymer with exchangeable ions to exchange with the heavy metal ions of the same nature in the solution through convection and diffusion the heavy ions are replaced on the surface of the resin to form a macroporous matrix and then removed 90 91 this method is mostly used for the treatment and recovery of heavy metal ions such as cr3 cd cu and hg contained in wastewater commonly used ion exchange adsorption resin materials include natural and synthetic materials mainly fibers and resins based on the nature of the functional groups contained in the ion exchange resin they can be divided into seven categories strong acid weak acid strong base weak base chelation acid base amphoteric and redox type 92 table 4 presents the corresponding characteristics the main reaction mechanism is as follows 6 2rsh m2 rs 2m 2h where m is a divalent metal ion the affinity selectivity of heavy metal ions to the resin determines the exchange between the resin and heavy metal ions and ion exchangers of the same nature have different reaction mechanisms 93 a cation exchange resin exchanges with heavy metal ions based on the electrostatic force of the ionic bond and an anion exchanger mainly depends on whether it can form a complex the greater the affinity of the complex the heavier the metals it can adsorb weng et al 94 exploited the special affinity of 2d amorphous mos3 with a porous structure for heavy metals tetrathiomolybdate mos4 2 anions were firmly bound to the strong anion exchange resins by substituting chloride ions and quaternary amine r4 n and the adsorption capacities were in the order hg2 pb2 cu2 cd2 the same conclusion was obtained when amorphous molybdenum sulfide ion exchange resin s960 mos4 was prepared by chelating the dipyridinium group on the resin with mos4 2 when dipicolylamine resin with a macroporous structure from which is good reusability and large adsorption capacities 95 the method is mostly aimed at bivalent trivalent charge ionic large processing volume renewable resin and low secondary pollution it can effectively remove trace substances in the recovery solution however it is susceptible to the influence of wastewater quality heavy metal ion concentration water temperature and ph and other factors and is expensive 4 2 4 membrane separation method the membrane separation method uses a permselective membrane as the separation medium and utilizes the driving force such as the pressure difference concentration difference and potential difference existing on both sides of the membrane to separate the solvent from the solute or particle 96 based on the membrane pore size and the driving force the different methods include microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf as shown in fig 7 97 the membrane separation method is widely used to remove sulfate pb cr cd and other toxic substances contained in water the membrane separation method has high efficiency small footprint wide application and easy operation 98 however the membrane is prone to fouling this requires high quality of influent water and pretreatments including coagulation sedimentation filtration adsorption and disinfection can be typically used to improve water quality 4 2 4 1 microfiltration microfiltration mf membranes utilize the pressure difference as the driving force to intercept particles with a particle size between 0 05 and 4 μm in water it has a uniform porous membrane a uniform membrane pore size and a large structure however heavy metal ions cannot be directly intercepted and must undergo appropriate pretreatment such as oxidation reduction and adsorption which has high filtration precision fast filtration and low adsorption capacity it is mainly used in food and beverage medicine petrochemical and other fields 99 4 2 4 2 ultrafiltration ultrafiltration uf is a pressurized membrane separation technology and its membrane is a porous asymmetric structure under the action of external driving force pressure colloids particles and substances with relatively high molecular weights are retained in water through the pressure active membrane while water and small solute particles permeate the separation process of the membrane it is generally not used to treat heavy metal wastewater but is mostly used in food medicine industrial wastewater treatment high purity water preparation and biotechnology industries 100 101 4 2 4 3 reverse osmosis and nanofiltration before nanofiltration nf or reverse osmosis ro treatment mf or uf pretreatment is often required to remove suspended solids colloids small particles and microorganisms present in water 102 acceptable performance and high durability of ro membranes can be achieved simultaneously by improving feedwater quality 103 the ro is arranged more closely and meticulously through external pressure the metal ions are separated by the semipermeable membrane under the higher osmotic pressure than the dissolved solids in the wastewater thereby effectively removing the organic matter cod heavy metals and various inorganic salts the nf membrane method falls between the ro and uf methods in terms of effectiveness and has the characteristics of both the structure of the membrane is charged and its specific charging behavior is closely related to the interaction between the ph value of the solution and the state of charge of the solute it has a high flux under low pressure particularly for divalent and polyvalent metal ions with high selectivity 104 the ro method has good water permeability however it has a high retention rate to salts the nf method has a higher permeation flux than ro can retain multivalent ions and dissolved molecules at low pressures and temperatures and is mostly used to recover metal ions 105 based on the surface properties roughness contact angle and hydrophobicity and operating parameters solution ph feed concentration and applied pressure which affect the membrane performance the effects of three different nf membranes on the solution permeability and solute rejection were compared the results showed the following order ts80 nf270 nf90 the use of ts80 was not easily affected by the ph when the ph is lower than the isoelectric point iep where the membrane charge is zero the membrane becomes positively charged and can help maximize the concentration and recovery of high order metals 106 and the removal rate of all polyvalent cations can reach 95 in addition compared with nf90 nf270 showed a higher initial rejection rate with increasing pressure the maximum rejection efficiencies of nf90 for sulfate and ca2 were 99 7 and 99 0 respectively however it is unsuitable for high pressure applications 107 although the nf270 membrane is more prone to fouling during processing it has a higher permeate flux of 88 6 l h m2 14 as amd is an important source for various resources the membrane separation technology has been found to be an effective method for water recovery wang et al 108 and ryu et al 109 pretreated amd using direct contact membrane distillation dcmd respectively recovering 60 of the water reducing the flux by 22 and recovering 80 of high quality water for reuse masindi et al 63 applied reverse osmosis systems to produce drinking water from amd while meeting the south african national standards sans 241 and specifications the membrane treatment technology is currently the main method used to recover clean water while meeting the requirements of domestic production mining operations and agricultural irrigation fig 8 shows the main utilization direction this fundamentally makes up for part of the investment cost and realizes resource utilization the stability of the membrane is key to the successful implementation of this technology although the nf method shows a good effect membrane surface fouling limits its performance the membrane surface is easily fouled to form gypsum scaling which limits the permeability of the membrane and the ability to recover water and concentrate metals 110 membrane fouling can be reduced by chemical cleaning which increases the permeability but reduces ion rejection 111 while developing new membrane materials such as nf270 coated with zinc oxide zno can change the characteristics of membrane roughness ipe so that the permeate flux of the coated membrane can be slightly increased which will show better fouling resistance and even degrade membrane surface contaminants zou et al 112 and wang et al 113 used plasma polymerization to modify the surface of an ro membrane to reduce the contact angle from 32 to 7 hyperbranched polyethyleneimine pei was modified to form positively charged polyamide pa nf membranes and the surface charge was changed from negative to positive resulting in enhanced membrane hydrophilicity and increased permeation flux thus significantly improving the anti fouling performance of the membrane and reducing organic pollution although it has produced satisfactory results it is still in the laboratory experimental stage and not yet applied to actual operation 4 2 5 microbiological method the microbiological method is based on the use of sulfate reducing bacteria srb under aerobic facultative and strictly anaerobic conditions 114 with a substrate as the carbon and energy source and sulfate caco3 nh4cl and other salts as terminal electron acceptors 115 and energy is obtained through dissimilation to reduce sulfate by srb the process includes decomposition stage electron transfer stage and oxidation stage as shown in fig 9 and so4 2 is reduced to s2 s2 and metal ions in the wastewater form less soluble sulfide and alkaline precipitates and neutralize the acidity of the wastewater thereby removing the metal ions 116 typically metal sulfide precipitates are stabler than metal hydroxides because they tend to form colloidal particles the method has a simple operation process and can recover elemental sulfur or sulfide the main reaction mechanism is as follows 117 7 organic matter microorganism hco 3 e atp 8 8h 8e so4 2 s2 4h2o 9 s2 2h h2s 10 s2 m2 ms 11 2oh m2 m oh 2 here m is a divalent metal ion common carbon sources include formic acid ph 5 6 acetic acid ph 7 5 8 5 ethanol ph 6 and lactic acid ph 4 118 however they are expensive and it is necessary to find alternative low cost carbon sources common agricultural wastes such as activated sludge animal manure straw straw or soluble metal solutions can be used as carbon sources for srb 119 neculita 120 used commercial sugar cane and 99 sucrose as the carbon source to enhance the removal of free cyanide from wastewater generated in a gold mine in major sugarcane processing countries such as china thailand and pakistan sugarcane processing wastewater can be removed simultaneously along with amd 121 dovorogwa et al 122 used tobacco waste as a carbon source to raise the ph value of acidic wastewater and successfully removed 90 of iron and zinc metals in another study organic rich industrial agricultural and domestic effluents were used as electron donors for the srb treatment of amd to selectively recover metals 123 under a suitable carbon source there is a certain relationship between the carbon source donor and bacteria the carbon source and electron donor directly affect the catabolism ability of srb and provide the donor required to maintain the microbial community the inherent microbial acidophilic heterotrophic bacteria sulfur oxidizing bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria methanogens and acetyl producing bacteria 124 interact with parameters such as heavy metals ph value and hydraulic retention time hrt associated with wastewater the heavy metals and microbial communities in the wastewater show an evident negative correlation the ph value not only affects the solubility of hydroxides and carbonates but also affects the hydrolysis and precipitation processes a shorter hrt does not allow sufficient time for the srb activity to neutralize the acidity and precipitate metals while longer retention times may lead to the depletion of available organic or sulfate sources for srbs and the temperature severely affects srb growth and sulfate reduction 125 126 studies show that the optimum temperature for srb growth is in the range of 28 38 c the activity of srb technology is easily inhibited by the toxicity of metabolites such as s2 thus reducing the treatment efficiency of its wastewater and the generated h2s gas will poison plants the low ph and high heavy metal concentration of acid mine wastewater will seriously affect the activity and growth of microorganisms such as srb 127 table 5 presents several analysis studies although this method is highly efficient economical and environmentally friendly it is significantly affected by the properties of amd and system operating parameters it is mostly applicable to abandoned mine water and mine water and is unsuitable under cold weather conditions it is significantly affected by the properties of amd and system operating parameters making it difficult to continue to find low cost and reliable new carbon sources and new electron donors and domesticated srb that are resistant to low temperature and low ph value at the present stage it can be the focus of future development 4 2 6 constructed wetland method constructed wetlands are mainly composed of substrates aquatic plants and microorganisms as shown in fig 10 the filtration and adsorption physical effects of soil walnut shell gravel and other material substrates are used to intercept and deposit suspended solids on substrates 131 under the carbon source and electron donor provided by the substrate the metal ions are precipitated by the chemical biological action of hydrolysis oxidation ion exchange and reduction through microbial transformation absorption and complexation by the roots of aquatic plants 132 the intensity and effect of its action mainly depend on the substrate vegetation types and microbial species this method has low investment low operating cost ease of management and high removal efficiency the main treatment mechanism for acid mine water can be summarized into three aspects 1 chemical biological oxidation and hydrolysis of metal ions in the presence of aerobic microorganisms 2 adsorption of metals by soil matrix plants and algae and 3 sulfate reduction by anaerobic bacteria in the presence of anaerobic microorganisms 133 134 12 2ch2o so4 2 hs 2hco3 h 13 2ch2o so4 2 2h h2s 2h2o 2co2 14 m2 h2s ms2 2h here ch2o is organic matter constructed wetlands can be used for a variety of wastewater treatments including industrial agricultural construction domestic water and other fields and it is a research hotspot for amd treatment as shown in table 6 based on plant growth conditions and water surface flow it can include aerobic cws anaerobic cws surface flow cws subsurface horizontal flow cws and vertical flow cws the corresponding characteristics are shown in the table in this process the matrix accounted for 49 7 82 5 of the metal removal pathway followed by plant absorption 16 1 39 0 and other processes 0 6 3 2 135 thus the substrate medium and vegetation type are key factors affecting the removal effect by comparing and analyzing the other influencing factors it has been generally proven that steel slag calcite and ceramsite work better as the matrix than gravel 136 cattail and reed are the best aquatic plants 137 their roots are more developed they have stronger oxygen transport capacity and the removal performance of heavy metals is the best through root absorption as for amd produced in yangquan mine in shanxi province phragmites australis and typha orientalis showed the best adsorption performance for mn and zn metals 138 a change in the substrate changes its own adsorption performance and the transformation of microorganisms rwa et al 139 took three types of mine waste coal gangue iron ore and manganese ore and used substrates showing different reflection forms changing the microbial community structure and diversity promoting the growth of wetland plants and further improving the metabolic capacity and nutrient adsorption capacity of the microorganisms external addition of domestic wastewater dw and plant litter broth plb as organic matrix carbon sources can promote microbial flora growth promote sulfate reduction activity and achieve effective removal of metals 132 table 7 presents more applications the entire process also depends on the type and characteristics of wastewater geographical location and other factors which may require the cultivation of multiple varieties of plants both constructed wetland and microbial method are easily affected by the environment and have high requirements on influent water quality processing takes longer than other methods the removal efficiency of many species affected by seasons is better in summer than in winter moreover it covers a large area and is unsuitable for areas with high perennial rainfall 4 3 recovery of rare earth elements amd is the main secondary source of rare earth elements rees 149 mainly light medium and heavy elements such as la ce pr nd eu dy and tb in recent years as an important strategic resource for many countries in the world rees have attracted global attention they have been widely used in petroleum chemical automobile battery and electronic fields as well as in renewable energy medicine and other fields in china it is also used as an agricultural fertilizer the world s ree reserves are mainly located in china brazil vietnam russia and india with china holding nearly half of the world s known ree reserves accounting for approximately 63 of global production 150 large amounts of rees are found in coal mine drainage in many countries such as coal mine drainage in illinois coal basin acid mine drainage in saint lucia mine cuba and acid pit lake in wisniowka mine south central poland 151 153 due to the uneven global resource reserves and the continuous development of advanced science and technology relying on ree materials the demand for rees is increasing thus stimulating the development of ree recycling technologies hence it is important to recover amd wastewater to reduce environmental pollution and cover the costs associated with post treatment in coal mining production in an amd system rees mainly exist in the form of cations and the common precipitation membrane separation and ion exchange technologies show a good recovery performance felipe et al 154 and luciano et al 155 used lewatit mds 200h dowex 50w40 resin and strong acid cationic resin to synthesize polymer resin lewatit mds 200h for uranium mine in brazil light rees were obtained showing a strong affinity for light rees the selectivity of the resin for rees is in the order light rare earth heavy rare earth the loading capacity of la was approximately 0 940 mmol g 1 and the efficiency was 85 ca and mg were separated from ree in 0 02 mol l 1 nh4edta solution with a low concentration and long residence time after elution a concentrate containing 39 0 mmol l 1 ree was obtained the efficiency was 89 in amd the presence of ph and other ions affects the recovery process of ree lópez et al 156 verified the possibility of ree recovery using a nanofiltration membrane the nanofiltration membrane polyamide membrane desal dl and semi aromatic polyamide nanofiltration membrane nf270 with positive surface charges can improve the membrane performance at ph 1 1 5 or 1 5 3 wang et al 157 recovered rees from amd containing ca al mn fe and mg using oxalic acid a common industrial precipitator with a strong affinity for rees in strongly acidic solutions at ph 1 5 2 reaction times of 2 h and oxalic acid dose in the range of 30 40 g l the ree recovery for individual ree species could be optimized from 95 to nearly 100 the recovery tends to be stable with increasing ph while ca and al in the water consume oxalic acid in turn when the dosage is excessive li et al 158 noted that h2o2 can improve the removal rate of rees thus it shows stronger adsorption and removal ability for rees however in the presence of aluminum ions the removal of rees by iron precipitation is reduced due to charge neutralization and competitive adsorption effects caused by aluminum species considering the environmental impact chemical consumption and cost the two step na2co3 process was used to treat amd with this process al at a concentration of 30 wt was precipitated by 90 in the first step ph 5 and rees at a concentration of 1 6 in the second step ph 7 a recovery of 85 159 since rees contain radioactive elements and can exist in water and soil long term exposure will cause irreversible harm to human health and the ecological environment recycling rees from second hand sources of amd can not only make up for the economic cost but also reduce the negative effects on the environment and human health due to ree exposure 5 synergistic technology there are many types of active and passive treatment technologies considering the composition of the amd the environment ph value and treatment cost using only one of them is associated with significant disadvantages for example it is difficult to recover valuable metals from sludge precipitation the constructed wetland method has high requirements on influent ph the adsorbent cannot easily settle in water although the membrane technology can produce high quality water it is difficult to achieve resource recovery and it is an ineffective means for treating sulfate and heavy metal ions therefore many studies have synergized two or more technologies for an efficient removal of sulfate and efficient recovery of useful heavy metals 5 1 application of synergistic technology markovic et al 160 combined neutralization precipitation with organic adsorption for amd in copper mining areas in southeastern serbia after two steps of precipitation 99 fe and cu were removed at ph 4 and 7 respectively and chitosan was added to remove mn when ph 6 5 selectively separating iron and copper from wastewater and helping recover iron and copper ions nguegang et al 161 coordinated the neutralization method with the constructed wetland using mgo nps to neutralize and precipitate some heavy metals and weaken the effect of toxic chemicals so as to improve the water intake level of the constructed wetland since then the advantages of the different technologies were further utilized to purify water forming a positive effect effectively removing sulfate and metal ions from water and meeting the wastewater discharge standards with removal rate of fe 99 8 al 99 5 mn 99 24 zn 98 36 cu 97 38 ni 97 7 so4 2 80 59 however this approach does not consider the sludge processing problems jin et al 162 used microbial heterotrophic acidophilus bimineralization to reduce iron oxide and sulfate in advance which reduced the amount of lime required for subsequent alkaline neutralization by 56 and gypsum precipitation by 68 and increased the removed al mn cu ni and zn content by 3 2 times the cost could be significantly reduced and a new sustainable treatment method was proposed most of these technologies have focused primarily on removing amd s own acidity metal and sulfate content and have failed to adequately recover and reuse the valuable components in amd sustainability and cost remain major challenges in this process 163 thus the focus of attention has shifted to amd resource recycling 5 2 recovery of metals metal ions such as copper iron and zinc present in amd have high recovery economic value and are an important part of industries such as electrical conductors metal equipment building materials and industrial facilities recycling valuable metals from amd and converting them into products or raw materials can reduce investment costs and environmental pollution with the development of technology membrane separation chemical oxidation electrochemistry selective precipitation and solvent extraction have been widely used to recover metal ions from amd table 8 lists the heavy metal recovery technologies adopted for amd the recovered heavy metals can not only become fe2o3 magnetite and gypsum products but also can be used as raw materials to treat wastewater tony et al 170 recovered iron from acid mine drainage to prepare iron coated sand as the fenton source and used fenton reaction to treat organic matter in polymer industrial wastewater muedi et al 171 utilized polycationic di metallic fe al pdfe al adsorbent formed by precipitation to remove the harmful heavy metal cr6 from amd to achieve a removal efficiency of 95 mwewa et al 172 obtained precipitates formed by 89 5 fe and 10 0 al recovered from amd at ph 5 0 to form polyaluminum ferric sulfate amd pafs and transformed them into coagulants to treat beer wastewater which reduced the volume of precipitated sludge by 95 0 and fully covered the treatment cost based on the data analysis selective precipitation is still a common technical means for metal recovery owing to its low cost and high recovery rate the dabaoshan open pit copper mine in guangdong generates approximately 15 000 m3 day of amd and the heavy metal content has exceeded the limit set by china national standard for drinking water in 2010 a chemical precipitation amd processing plant with a capacity of 15 000 m3 d was built downstream the sludge volume reached 100 tons day and the problem of sludge sedimentation and cost effectiveness was solved by adopting the phase precipitation process and the sediment refining process as shown in fig 11 first 0 15 ml l of 30 h2o2 was oxidized and the selective addition of ca oh 2 and na2s solution was used for four step fractional precipitation with the ph controlled in the range of 3 5 4 0 fe was first precipitated at ph 8 5 mn and all other heavy metals were precipitated the fe cu zn and mn contents in the specific sludge were 45 91 11 58 31 06 and 7 95 respectively the recovery efficiencies of fe cu zn and mn from amd reached 99 51 86 09 87 87 and 79 71 respectively after the manganese precipitation process the metal contained in the effluent was below the federal regulation cfr limit the fe2o3 content after roasting can be used in the coating industry while copper and zinc sludge were refined into copper and zinc concentrate by the flotation process manganese slag can also replace 45 ordinary portland cement opc in cement materials 173 the benefits of successfully recovering metals more than compensate for the investment costs of the chemicals used 6 conclusions the extensiveness complexity toxicity and persistence of amd make it one of the main threats to the sustainable advancement of the mining industry in terms of reliable and safe production taking strong technical measures for treatment and recovery depending on the geographical location of mines coal and rock occurrences and hydrological and mining conditions should be the main research directions going forward this study analyzed the composition of amd and summarized the basic principles of prevention and treatment technologies the applications of the neutralization precipitation method adsorption method ion exchange method membrane separation method and microbial and constructed wetland method were evaluated and the possibility of resource recovery was analyzed the key differences between the various technologies and their and applicability were identified the main conclusions of the study are as follows the acid mine wastewater produced in the mining of sulfur containing coal mines contains extremely corrosive so4 2 ions and toxic heavy metal ions directly discharging the wastewater without strict treatment can harm the ecological environment and pose a direct threat to human life when source prevention and control measures such as isolation and plugging fungicide delivery and accelerated drainage involve a wide range of environmental factors the actual operation is difficult lacking stability and sustainability and making it difficult for them to become an effective control means the final treatment technology is currently the main means of amd treatment in this approach physical chemical and biological methods are employed to remove sulfates heavy metals and other pollutants this is an effective method for the resource recovery of water and rees the precipitation process of the active technology is simple and is the main means to remove pollutants and recover metals and rees although the recovery of resources makes up for part of the cost the post treatment of the sludge by products remains a technical drawback the adsorption method is relatively economical and the reaction is fast however the selection of the adsorbent is important the ion exchange method and the membrane separation method have strong targeting high removal efficiency and are suitable for the recovery of rees and water resources respectively however the membrane change problem causing membrane pollution remains a technical difficulty although the automatic treatment technologies of microbial and constructed wetland method for secondary pollution are at a small scale the removal effect is good though the investment cost is high and the methods are affected by water conditions and the natural environment any single final treatment technology cannot meet the treatment requirements and emission standards under all environmental conditions the synergistic technology combines the complementary advantages of the two technologies to achieve a metal removal rate of nearly 100 and an efficient recovery of cu zn fe and other metal ions by 70 the application of oxidation synergistic fractional precipitation to dabaoshan mine in china reflects the considerable economic benefits that is a sustainable development of the entire system through cost compensation future directions can be convenient joint operation low secondary pollution cost

12593,antimicrobial resistance is now an increasingly serious threat to public health in this study the distribution and enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes args in aerobic granular sludges ags during sulfamethoxazole smx biodegradation were examined the removal percentage of smx kept higher than 99 at the loading of 750 μg l after the formation of ags through quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and metagenomics we showed that higher abundance of args were in flocs 143 arg subtypes 3 08 0 99 107 copies per ngdna and the outer ags 111 arg subtypes 3 50 0 25 107 copies per ngdna than that in the inner ags 102 arg subtypes 8 10 0 79 106 copies per ngdna two mechanisms may explain the simultaneous antibiotic removal and mitigation of arg enrichment by ags firstly dense aggregated structure of ags and the abundant extracellular polymeric substances eps play an important role in mitigating args enrichment by preventing antibiotic transfer into the inner space of ags the deterministic mechanisms drive ags bacterial community assemble βnti 2 in a direction toward accumulating eps producers secondly the higher abundance of antibiotic co metabolic genes in ags than flocs revealed that functional bacteria in the outer ags may decrease antibiotic pressures for the inner bacteria by co metabolic degradation of antibiotics through nitrification and denitrification this work discovered that ags harbor arg independent resistance and degradation of antibiotics and provided a new perspective for biological wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords antibiotic resistance genes aerobic granular sludge extracellular polymeric substances bacteria community assemble co metabolism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antimicrobial pollution is a global health concern especially in wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 in which antibiotics are ubiquitous and gene transfers are frequent among diverse microbes 2 sulfamethoxazole smx is one of the most frequently detected antibiotics in the wastewater treatment plants up to 1340 μg l 3 and could hardly be removed by the current wastewater treatment process due to the stable chemical structure of smx 4 only 10 60 of smx could be eliminated by microorganisms in the biological wastewater treatment arts 5 and the residue antibiotics could enrich antibiotic resistance genes args 6 the world health organization has identified antimicrobial resistance amr as one of the biggest threats to public health that cause 700 000 deaths annually and 10 million deaths in 2050 if not controlled 7 amr development is that microbes acquire args by vertical or horizontal gene transfer hgt and mutation under antibiotic selection pressures 8 10 hgt includes three main pathways conjugation 11 transformation 12 and transduction 13 basing on the conjugative elements such as plasmids cell free dna and viral phages respectively the selection pressures induced by antibiotic pollution will greatly facilitate the hgt processes therefore decreasing this selection pressures is essential for amr control however in order to biodegrade antibiotics antibiotic resistant microbes were generally applied to break the structures of antibiotics in most researches 14 this biodegradation of antibiotics can certainly enrich a large amount of args because antibiotics exhibit strong toxicity and only those bacteria carrying args can survive and persist in antibiotic contaminated environments 15 therefore it s important to achieve simultaneous antibiotic degradation and mitigation of args accumulation in wastewater treatment process in the field of epidemiology biofilms are considered a nerve wracking question due to its inherent resistance to antibiotics 16 the resistance of biofilms to antibiotics depends on multicellular strategies rather than args for example extracellular polymeric substances eps a matrix which is composed of edna proteins and polysaccharides can be generate to provide a highly protected phenotypic microenvironment to prevent penetration of the antibiotic into the biofilm 16 however whether this protection of eps can mitigate arg enrichment in activated sludge has not been studied in addition to controlling the enrichment of args antibiotic removal is also an important target for sewage treatment aerobic granular sludges ags known as a special type of biofilm plays an important role in wastewater treatment 17 ags exhibit great advantages to degradation of multiple pollutants due to their tolerance to toxicity and high biodiversity 17 on one hand ags formation depends on the adhesion of eps 18 which can protect bacteria from antibiotic toxicity and prevent antibiotics migrate to the inside of ags 19 20 not only that ags harbor aerobic and anoxic zones and can carry out simultaneous nitrification and denitrification 21 making ags harbor the ability of degrading antibiotics by co metabolism 22 24 however until now its s not clear whether ags can mitigate args enrichment considering their arg independent resistance and antibiotic degradation in this study we investigate if ags can simultaneously degrade antibiotics and mitigate the enrichment of args and infer the underlying mechanisms ags was cultured in a sequencing batch reactor sbr while the floccular and both inner and outer portions of granular samples were collected at different time points quantitative pcr and metagenomics were conducted to monitor the abundances of args and identified the resistomes respectively both antibiotic tolerance assays and eps composition analysis were performed for floccular and granular samples the bacteria community assemble processes and correlations between args and functional genes were analyzed to discover the mechanisms from the ecological and molecular genetic perspectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment set up experiment was operated in a sequencing batch

acetonitrile and 70 formic acid solution 0 1 v v at a constant flow rate of 1 00 ml min the excitation and emission wavelength were 270 and 340 nm respectively the particle size of ags was determined by a qicpic dynamic image analysis system sympatec gmbh germany 2 3 dna extraction from flocs and ags to investigate whether ags have an advantage on mitigating args enrichment compared with flocs ags and flocs were collected simultaneously on day 164 and they were separated with 200 μm screen the small fines flocs were collected by centrifuging at 8000 rpm min for 5 min to distinguish the inner and outer part of ags shear experiments were performed following the protocols proposed by lu et al 26 and liu et al 27 fifty ags with the size 1935 9 142 5 μm measured by qicpic dynamic image

separately extracted with a dneasy powersoil kit qiagen the quality and concentration of extracted dna were determined using a nano 300 micro spectrophotometer all sheng 2 4 absolute quantification of sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 and 16s rrna gene to monitor the dynamic change of args and total bacteria over time and the distribution of args in different part of sludge under exposure of antibiotics quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr was conducted to track abundances of sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 and 16s rrna gene of the biosamples described above a bioer 9600 fqd 96a real time pcr system dna was used for performing qpcr assay the volume of qpcr reactions was 20 μl including 10 μl sybr green pcr master mix 0 5 μl 10 μm primer 8 μl sterile ddh2o and 1 μl template dna the primer set f 5 aggctggtggttatgcactc 3 and r 5 caccgagaccaatagcggaa 3 was employed for amplifying sul1 gene while 1055f 5 atggctgtcgtcagct 3 and 1392r 5 acgggcggtgtgtac 3 were used for amplifying bacterial 16s rrna gene the qpcr reaction was performed with an initial denaturation step of 10 min at 95 c followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 5 s annealing and extension at 60 c for 10 s standard curves of threshold cycle ct values versus the number of gene copies for each gene were generated through serial decimal dilutions of plasmid dna standard curves were linear r2

were run in triplicate and data were expressed as average gene copy numbers per ng dna standard deviations 2 5 antibiotic tolerance assays of ags in different forms to verify whether coacervate structure of ags contribute to the antibiotic tolerance antibiotic tolerance assays were conducted with ags in coacervate and floccular forms under smx concentration of 0 1 and 5 mg l ags were collected from the reactor and sieved with 200 μm screen to remove the flocs ten ags were crushed by vortex finder and transferred into a 5 ml sterilized centrifuge tube filled with 2 ml pbs smx with different concentrations 0 1 and 5 mg l was added to provide different pressures ten ags not crushed were treated under the same condition all the tests were conducted in triplicate and incubated in incubator at 30 c for 8 h afterwards live bacteria were quantified by propidium monoazide pma based qpcr following the method of nocker et al 28 with some modifications samples above were treated with a final concentration of 50 μm pma stock concentration of 20 mm dissolved in 20 dimethyl sulfoxide for 5 min in the dark then the samples were light exposed for 5 min using a 650 w halogen light source sealed beam lamp 64 540 220 v 3400 k osram general the samples were laid on ice under the light source about 20 cm and shook intermittently to guarantee homogeneous light exposure after photo induced cross linking sludge was pelleted at 8000 rpm for 5 min prior to dna extraction genomic dna of sludge samples was extracted using a dneasy powersoil kit qiagen dna of samples not treated by

microscope sem and eps measurements scanning electron microscope sem hitachi tm 1000 was applied to characterize the morphology of ags eps was extracted following the method of yu et al yu et al 2018 polysaccharide and protein in the collected eps were determined by the anthrone method and the coomassie brilliant blue g 250 dye binding method respectively see details in si text s2 parts of ags were collected for volatile suspended solids vss measurement according to standard methods 2 7 metagenomic sequencing and identification of args all the 7 samples above were performed metagenomic sequencing using an illumina novaseq 6000 with the sequencing strategy of index 2 150 pe paired end sequencing more than 606 million reads for the 7 samples were generated and nonpareil was used to assess the coverage in metagenomic data sets the percentages of bases that have a q score above 30 were between 92 44 and 92 98 demonstrating the metagenomic sequencing quality is good raw data of the metagenomic sequencing were deposited into the genebank with bioproject accession number prjna902909 all metagenomic sequencing reads were checked using fastqc and trimmed using trimmomatic with the default parameters and reads with low quality scores were removed the filtered reads were co assembled into contigs using metaspades args were identified using the resistance gene identifier rgi v 5 2 1 of the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database using option high performance with the curated blastp bit score cut off including perfect and strict rgi matched sequence 29 2 8 microbial community analysis the branching module metabat2 v1 7 in metawrap was used to produce metagenome assembled genomes mags with contigs 500 bp and checkm was used to assess the quality of mags 30 gtdb tk v0 3 3 and coverm v0 6 1were used to taxonomic classification and quantification of mags 31 32 the shannon and simpson index were calculated by vegan package in r to judge alpha diversity of microbial community beta diversity of microbial community was judged by the principal coordinate analysis pcoa by calculating bray curtis similarity matrix with the vegdist function in vegan and visualized with ggplot2 16s rrna genes were identified with phyloflash v2 0 and quantified based on the mapped reads percentage and database hits the picante r package was firstly used to calculate the mean nearest taxon distance metric βmntd 33 then a null modeling was implemented to calculate the β nearest taxon index βnti 34 35 βnti 2 means the heterogeneous selection of deterministic processes βnti 2 indicates the homogeneous selection of deterministic processes βnti 2 indicates the stochastic processes of the community assemble 2 9 correlation analysis of functional genes and args opening reading frames orfs were predicted using prodigal v2 6 3 36 and translated into protein sequences using emboss v6 6 0 37 eggnog mapper v2 1 5 was used to perform functional annotation of translated protein sequences 38 in diamond mode against the eggnog 5 0 database 39 with an e value threshold of 10 5 the correlations between the gene richness within each functional category cog and args and shannon index were calculated using spearman s correlations in addition antioxidant system genes including catalase genes and superoxide dismutase sod genes nitrogen metabolism related genes that were capable of degrading antibiotics by co metabolism such as ammonia monooxygenase amo genes denitrification related genes dr and cytochrome p450 coding genes cyp450 were selected and their correlations to args were calculated by using spearman s correlations 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performances for c n and smx removal during 170 days of operation the reactor exhibited a good performance on the removal of cod nh4 n no3 no2 and smx effluent cod of the reactor was always 130 mg l with the cod removal rate higher than 87 fig 1a it is noted that cod removal performance was not affected when the concentration of smx increased from 500 to 750 μg l indicating the good anti interference performance of ags to antibiotic the average concentrations of nh4 n and no2 in effluent were 1 41 the removal rate of nh4 n is 98 25 and 3 01 mg l respectively during the entire run cycle fig 1b although the no3 in effluent was 20 mg l during the first 40 days it kept below 10 mg l after the formation of ags which indicated a good denitrification performance moreover although the smx in influent increased from 500 to 750 μg l the removal rate of smx was always higher than 96 during the 170 days operation fig 1c it is notable that the smx removal rate was even higher than 99 after the formation of ags all the results above showed that ags can simultaneously remove c n and antibiotic and exhibited a good anti interference performance ags formation depend on the skeleton function of filamentous bacteria and adhesion of eps producing bacteria 18 and eps was reported can protect bacteria from antibiotic toxicity 19 20 in addition ags harbor aerobic and anoxic zones from outside to inside and perform simultaneously nitrification and denitrification 21 which have been reported degrading antibiotics by co metabolism 22 24 therefore eps producer and nitrogen metabolism bacteria on the outer sphere of ags can protect microorganism in the inner space from antibiotic pressure which may contribute to args enrichment mitigation as for the whole microbiota 3 2 distribution of args in time and space of the reactor to investigate the distribution of arg in time and space of the reactor we collected samples at different time points and separately quantify sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 in flocs the whole ags and outer and inner portions of ags at the 164th day at which time the average particle size of ags was 2000 μm fig s1 by qpcr the bacterial 16s rrna gene increased from 3 69 0 43 108 in seed sludge to 1 18 0 11 109 copies per ng dna in ags at the 164th day fig 2a suggesting a significant biomass increasing in ags it is worth noting that ags has a higher total bacteria number than flocs at the same time which accords with the previous report that ags exhibits many advantages such as high biomass retention outstanding settleability and greater tolerance to toxins 40 under the selection pressure of smx gene sul1 increased over the time as expected fig 2b however the number of gene sul1 in flocs was much more than that in ags at the 164th day and the outer ags owned the most abundant gene sul1 while the inner ags owned the least similarly the ratio of sul1 to 16s rrna had a same trend with gene sul1 copies fig 2c which indicates ags indeed mitigate arg enrichment it may be due to the inner ags could avoid antibiotic pressure with the protection of the outer ags obviously arg enriched in the outer ags because it was in direct contact with antibiotics however ags has a tight compact structure which can prevent antibiotics migrate to the inside of ags and thus protect the inner bacteria from antibiotic toxicity 19 20 based on the metagenomic sequencing and resistome identification there were 94 102 70 144 113 111 and 102 orfs identified as args in these 7 samples compared with seed sludge args in all samples increased except for the sample on day 100 it may be due that settling time decreased to promote the formation of ags and thus resulted in the massive loss of incompact sludge both total and each drug class of args were most in flocs at the 164th day fig 2d especially multi drug resistance mdr aminoglycoside and tetracycline args which were selected directed by antibiotics fed from the influent it is notable that the inner ags harbored the least arg subtypes among the three ags source samples which suggested again that args were less enriched in the inner ags in all 7 samples antibiotic efflux was the main resistance mechanism fig 2e which can t alter the antibiotic molecular structure antibiotic inactivation that inactivates the drug by adding specific chemical moieties to the compound or that destroy the molecule itself was followed 3 3 ags has greater arg independent antibiotic tolerance ags was considered as a special type of biofilm and have been used to treat toxic organic chemicals due to its high tolerance to toxicity 17 to investigate the effects of granule structure on antibiotic pressure intact and crushed ags were separately exposed to antibiotic with different concentrations as shown in fig 3a the 16s rrna gene copies representing live bacteria in flocs decreased sharply from 2 42 108 to 1 44 108 copies ng dna with the increase of antibiotic concentration from 0 to 5 mg l in contrast the falling range of the live bacteria was much less in ags it is interesting that the ratio of sul1 to 16s rrna in live bacteria of ags was much less than that in live bacteria of flocs fig 3b which suggested that bacteria in ags harbored greater arg independent antibiotic tolerance eps was reported to be an effective barrier for microbial cells to resist antibiotic stress in activated sludges 41 42 based on the sem image ags has a compact surface fig 3c and bacteria are tightly held together by secretions fig 3d in addition extracellular polysaccharides and proteins in the extracted eps were measured separately fig 3e and it was observed that both polysaccharides and proteins were more in ags than that in flocs these results indicate that polysaccharides and proteins may play an important role on relieving the selection pressures of antibiotics it has been reported that various redox active components in epss of sludge provide plentiful binding sites for organic micropollutants and present an important adaptive mechanism of bacterial cells to lower pollutant toxicity 43 44 for example eps can relieve the selection pressure of antibiotics and the extracellular proteins by providing diverse sites to bind with antibiotics to prevente their penetration 20 42 therefore the eps produced by ags may prevent antibiotic move into the inner space and thus mitigate args enrichment 3 4 deterministic mechanisms drive ags bacterial community assembles in a direction that s more protective against antibiotic toxicity a growing body of research has indicated that bacteria community composition plays an important role on the resistome shaping 45 46 therefore it is important to reveal the community assembly mechanism of aerobic granulation process from the start up to ags maturation alpha diversity of bacteria community decreased first due to habitat specialization of the reactor conditions and then increased due to the exogenous microbes input with influent fig 4a among all biosamples ags had the highest alpha diversity which forebode the higher metabolism diversity beta diversity analysis showed that bacterial community structure of seed sludge far differed from others which indicated bacterial community structure changed dramatically over time it is notable that bacterial community structures of three ags samples differ from flocs even though they were collected at the same time and the inner ags had a distinct community from the other two ags samples fig 4b these results suggested that the morphology of sludge and spatial distribution of ags play an important role on microbial community compositions which may further influence the resistome to further clarify the processes and mechanisms of community assembly of sludge in the reactor the null model and neutral community model were used to assess the relative contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes to shaping ags microbial communities it was found that community shaping between flocs at the 164th day and seed sludge sludge at the 35th and 100th day was determined by stochastic processes βnti 2 fig 4c however deterministic forces heterogeneous selection drove community shaping between ags and seed sludge sludge at the 35th day and flocs at the 164th day βnti 2 fig 4c and the deterministic selection contain multiple mechanisms such as abiotic environmental filtering and biotic interactions 47 on one hand antibiotic selection pressure is one of important abiotic filtering factors and was previously reported to be an important factor for performance and microbial community of ags 48 in this study toxic pollutants may induce the secretion of eps 41 leading to ags formation as a barrier for bacteria to resist antibiotics in turn in addition stochastic processes became more evident with the decrease of the selection pressures 49 therefore antibiotic toxicity may play an important role on dominating the deterministic community assemble of ags by abiotic filtering on the other hand inherent underlying mechanisms of aerobic granulation may also play a role on this deterministic community assemble process by biotic interactions although there is no consensus on the underlying mechanisms for aerobic granulation 17 filamentous or rod like bacteria and eps producers etc were deemed to be essential for granular formation in our system the well known rod shaped eps secreting zoogloea 50 and thauera 51 were more abundant in ags samples than that in flocs at the 164th day fig 4d however amaricoccus a genus capable of producing high levels of exocellular capsular materials to induce poor settleability of activated sludge 52 was much more dominant in flocs compared to ags therefore different skeleton bacteria in ags and flocs spontaneously attract corresponding interactive partners and more eps producers in ags could protect their partners against antibiotic toxicity 3 5 deterministic community assembles of ags enhance arg independent antibiotic resistance and the abundance of antibiotics degradation genes microbial community assembly processes are determined to community compositions and further influence community function bacterial communities differing in potential community functional traits were inferred from metagenomic sequencing and the correlations between these functional traits and args were further calculated genes associated with dna replication recombination and repair extracellular structures energy production and conversion and intracellular trafficking secretion and vesicular transport were positively related to arg abundance the upper half part of fig 5 dna replication recombination and repair constitute an important adaptive mechanism such as antibiotic resistance in bacteria 53 and bacteria could enhance the acquirement of args exogenously by upregulating these functional genes under selection pressures 54 therefore much less replication recombination and repair related genes in ags samples only 0 71 to 0 79 times to seed sludge than that in flocs 1 16 times to seed sludge indicated that antibiotic exert less selective pressure on ags this may explain why ags can mitigate args enrichment likewise the abundances of genes coding extracellular structures which mainly contained pilus that may mediate horizontal gene transfer of args 55 was the least in the inner ags sample 1 15 times higher than seed sludge and the most in flocs 1 41 times higher than seed sludge which indicated less potential of the inner ags to transfer args furthermore oxidative damage stimulating the overproduction of ros is one of important triggers to induce antibiotic susceptible microbes to acquire args exogenously 54 55 bacteria can avoid this oxidative damage by defense mechanisms such as dna binding ferritin like protein mediated oxidative damage protectant 56 the thioredoxin antioxidant system 57 ros scavenger carotenoid biosynthesis 58 59 and so on higher abundance of these functional genes the half bottom of fig 5 related to defense mechanisms and secondary metabolites biosynthesis mentioned above in ags may explain why ags harbor less args further analysis of the relationship between antioxidant systems and arg abundance showed that arg abundance was negatively correlated with catalase and sod gene abundance fig 6a and both catalase and sod genes were the least in flocs at the 164th day which harbored the most args fig 6b and c these results suggested that ags may mitigate args hgt and thus reduce the args enrichment by ros scavenging with antioxidant system as we know ags harbor aerobic and anoxic zones and can achieve simultaneous nitrification and denitrification 21 nowadays a growing body of researches has reported that antibiotics could be degraded with nitrification and denitrification by co metabolism and ammonia monooxygenase genes amoa nitrate reductase genes and cytochrome p450 genes were the main functional genes on the co metabolism processes 22 24 for example smx could be degraded by ammonia oxidizing bacteria and this degradation stopped with the presence of amo inhibitor allylthiourea 22 theoretically degradation could lead to the reduction of antibiotic concentration and selection pressure and thus mitigate the enrichment of args in accordance with this trend arg abundance was negatively correlated with all the amoa nitrate reductase genes and cytochrome p450 genes abundance in our system fig 6a which suggested that the more the n metabolic genes the less args all the three functional genes were more abundant in ags samples than that in flocs at the same time fig 6d e and f which indicated antibiotics may be degraded by co metabolism in ags and thus mitigate args enrichment by decreasing the selection pressure from antibiotics 3 6 mechanisms of ags mitigating args enrichment based on the degradation of antibiotic args quantification and resistome identification eps measurement community assembles and correlations between args and functional genes we propose the underlying mechanisms of ags mitigating args enrichment by arg independent approaches fig 7 firstly eps were produced by bacteria in ags and they may serve as a barrier and prevent antibiotics move into the inner space of ags e g binding antibiotic to extracellular proteins thus protect bacteria from antibiotic toxicity secondly community assembles of ags was founded driven by deterministic forces heterogeneous selection which shift community in a direction that s more protective against antibiotic toxicity thirdly dense aggregates of ags can inhibit antibiotics migrate into the inner space of ags and thus decrease the selection pressures to bacteria in the inner ags fourthly unique aerobic and anoxic partitions of ags 22 24 and the high abundance of nitrogen metabolism genes in ags especially in the outer surface of ags could degrade antibiotics by co metabolism through nitrification and denitrification and thus reduce the selection pressures of bacteria in the ags particulally for these in the inner space of sludge in contrast bacteria in floccular sludge fully exposure to antibiotics and have no such multicellular strategies to resist antibiotics and they must develop amr to survive under antibiotic selection pressures 4 conclusion in this study the role of ags on arg enrichment mitigation during smx biodegradation were examined it was demonstrated that ags exhibited a good performance for smx removal at the loading of 750 μg l the abundance of args in the inner ags was 73 7 and 76 9 lower than that in flocs and the outer ags respectively the mechanism of this result involved the protection roles of dense aggregated structure of ags and the abundant eps that could prevent antibiotic transfer into the inner space of ags further microbial community analysis indicated that the deterministic bacterial community assemble βnti 2 contribute ags to accumulate eps producers further functional gene analysis indicated that n metabolic genes was negatively correlated with args which revealed that antibiotic co metabolic degradation could decrease selection pressures and thus mitigate the arg enrichment these results comprehensively revealed the influence mechanisms of ags on arg enrichment

12593,antimicrobial resistance is now an increasingly serious threat to public health in this study the distribution and enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes args in aerobic granular sludges ags during sulfamethoxazole smx biodegradation were examined the removal percentage of smx kept higher than 99 at the loading of 750 μg l after the formation of ags through quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and metagenomics we showed that higher abundance of args were in flocs 143 arg subtypes 3 08 0 99 107 copies per ngdna and the outer ags 111 arg subtypes 3 50 0 25 107 copies per ngdna than that in the inner ags 102 arg subtypes 8 10 0 79 106 copies per ngdna two mechanisms may explain the simultaneous antibiotic removal and mitigation of arg enrichment by ags firstly dense aggregated structure of ags and the abundant extracellular polymeric substances eps play an important role in mitigating args enrichment by preventing antibiotic transfer into the inner space of ags the deterministic mechanisms drive ags bacterial community assemble βnti 2 in a direction toward accumulating eps producers secondly the higher abundance of antibiotic co metabolic genes in ags than flocs revealed that functional bacteria in the outer ags may decrease antibiotic pressures for the inner bacteria by co metabolic degradation of antibiotics through nitrification and denitrification this work discovered that ags harbor arg independent resistance and degradation of antibiotics and provided a new perspective for biological wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords antibiotic resistance genes aerobic granular sludge extracellular polymeric substances bacteria community assemble co metabolism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antimicrobial pollution is a global health concern especially in wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 in which antibiotics are ubiquitous and gene transfers are frequent among diverse microbes 2 sulfamethoxazole smx is one of the most frequently detected antibiotics in the wastewater treatment plants up to 1340 μg l 3 and could hardly be removed by the current wastewater treatment process due to the stable chemical structure of smx 4 only 10 60 of smx could be eliminated by microorganisms in the biological wastewater treatment arts 5 and the residue antibiotics could enrich antibiotic resistance genes args 6 the world health organization has identified antimicrobial resistance amr as one of the biggest threats to public health that cause 700 000 deaths annually and 10 million deaths in 2050 if not controlled 7 amr development is that microbes acquire args by vertical or horizontal gene transfer hgt and mutation under antibiotic selection pressures 8 10 hgt includes three main pathways conjugation 11 transformation 12 and transduction 13 basing on the conjugative elements such as plasmids cell free dna and viral phages respectively the selection pressures induced by antibiotic pollution will greatly facilitate the hgt processes therefore decreasing this selection pressures is essential for amr control however in order to biodegrade antibiotics antibiotic resistant microbes were generally applied to break the structures of antibiotics in most researches 14 this biodegradation of antibiotics can certainly enrich a large amount of args because antibiotics exhibit strong toxicity and only those bacteria carrying args can survive and persist in antibiotic contaminated environments 15 therefore it s important to achieve simultaneous antibiotic degradation and mitigation of args accumulation in wastewater treatment process in the field of epidemiology biofilms are considered a nerve wracking question due to its inherent resistance to antibiotics 16 the resistance of biofilms to antibiotics depends on multicellular strategies rather than args for example extracellular polymeric substances eps a matrix which is composed of edna proteins and polysaccharides can be generate to provide a highly protected phenotypic microenvironment to prevent penetration of the antibiotic into the biofilm 16 however whether this protection of eps can mitigate arg enrichment in activated sludge has not been studied in addition to controlling the enrichment of args antibiotic removal is also an important target for sewage treatment aerobic granular sludges ags known as a special type of biofilm plays an important role in wastewater treatment 17 ags exhibit great advantages to degradation of multiple pollutants due to their tolerance to toxicity and high biodiversity 17 on one hand ags formation depends on the adhesion of eps 18 which can protect bacteria from antibiotic toxicity and prevent antibiotics migrate to the inside of ags 19 20 not only that ags harbor aerobic and anoxic zones and can carry out simultaneous nitrification and denitrification 21 making ags harbor the ability of degrading antibiotics by co metabolism 22 24 however until now its s not clear whether ags can mitigate args enrichment considering their arg independent resistance and antibiotic degradation in this study we investigate if ags can simultaneously degrade antibiotics and mitigate the enrichment of args and infer the underlying mechanisms ags was cultured in a sequencing batch reactor sbr while the floccular and both inner and outer portions of granular samples were collected at different time points quantitative pcr and metagenomics were conducted to monitor the abundances of args and identified the resistomes respectively both antibiotic tolerance assays and eps composition analysis were performed for floccular and granular samples the bacteria community assemble processes and correlations between args and functional genes were analyzed to discover the mechanisms from the ecological and molecular genetic perspectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment set up experiment was operated in a sequencing batch

acetonitrile and 70 formic acid solution 0 1 v v at a constant flow rate of 1 00 ml min the excitation and emission wavelength were 270 and 340 nm respectively the particle size of ags was determined by a qicpic dynamic image analysis system sympatec gmbh germany 2 3 dna extraction from flocs and ags to investigate whether ags have an advantage on mitigating args enrichment compared with flocs ags and flocs were collected simultaneously on day 164 and they were separated with 200 μm screen the small fines flocs were collected by centrifuging at 8000 rpm min for 5 min to distinguish the inner and outer part of ags shear experiments were performed following the protocols proposed by lu et al 26 and liu et al 27 fifty ags with the size 1935 9 142 5 μm measured by qicpic dynamic image

sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 and 16s rrna gene to monitor the dynamic change of args and total bacteria over time and the distribution of args in different part of sludge under exposure of antibiotics quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr was conducted to track abundances of sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 and 16s rrna gene of the biosamples described above a bioer 9600 fqd 96a

dna the primer set f 5 aggctggtggttatgcactc 3 and r 5 caccgagaccaatagcggaa 3 was employed for amplifying sul1 gene while 1055f 5 atggctgtcgtcagct 3 and 1392r 5 acgggcggtgtgtac 3 were used for amplifying bacterial 16s rrna gene the qpcr reaction was performed with an initial denaturation step of 10 min at 95 c followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 5 s annealing and extension at 60 c for 10 s standard curves of threshold cycle ct values versus the number of gene copies for each gene were generated through serial decimal dilutions of plasmid dna standard curves were linear r2

were run in triplicate and data were expressed as average gene copy numbers per ng dna standard deviations 2 5 antibiotic tolerance assays of ags in different forms to verify whether coacervate structure of ags contribute to the antibiotic tolerance antibiotic tolerance assays were conducted with ags in coacervate and floccular forms under smx concentration of 0 1 and 5 mg l ags were collected from the reactor and sieved with 200 μm screen to remove the flocs ten ags were crushed by vortex finder and transferred into a 5 ml sterilized centrifuge tube filled with 2 ml pbs smx with different concentrations 0 1 and 5 mg l was added to provide different pressures ten ags not crushed were treated under the same condition all the tests were conducted in triplicate and incubated in incubator at 30 c for 8 h afterwards live bacteria were quantified by propidium monoazide pma based qpcr following the method of nocker et al 28 with some modifications samples above were treated with a final concentration of 50 μm pma stock concentration of 20 mm dissolved in 20 dimethyl sulfoxide for 5 min in the dark then the samples were light exposed for 5 min using a 650 w halogen light source sealed beam lamp 64 540 220 v 3400 k osram general the samples were laid on ice under the light source about 20 cm and shook intermittently to guarantee homogeneous light exposure after photo

microscope sem and eps measurements scanning electron microscope sem hitachi tm 1000 was applied to characterize the morphology of ags eps was extracted following the method of yu et al yu et al 2018 polysaccharide and protein in the collected eps were determined by the anthrone method and the coomassie brilliant blue g 250 dye binding method respectively see details in si text s2 parts of ags were collected for volatile suspended solids vss measurement according to standard methods 2 7 metagenomic sequencing and identification of args all the 7 samples above were performed metagenomic sequencing using an illumina novaseq 6000 with the sequencing strategy of index 2 150 pe paired end sequencing more than 606 million reads for the 7 samples were generated and nonpareil was used to assess the coverage in metagenomic data sets the percentages of bases that have a q score above 30 were between 92 44 and 92 98 demonstrating the metagenomic sequencing quality is good raw data of the metagenomic sequencing were deposited into the genebank with bioproject accession number prjna902909 all metagenomic sequencing reads were checked using fastqc and trimmed using trimmomatic with the default parameters and reads with low quality scores were removed the filtered reads were co assembled into contigs using metaspades args were identified using the resistance gene identifier rgi v 5 2 1 of the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database using option high performance with the curated blastp bit score cut off including perfect and strict rgi matched sequence 29 2 8 microbial community analysis the branching module metabat2 v1 7 in metawrap was used to produce metagenome assembled genomes mags with contigs 500 bp and checkm was used to assess the quality of mags 30 gtdb tk v0 3 3 and coverm v0 6 1were used to taxonomic classification and quantification of mags 31 32 the shannon and simpson index were calculated by vegan package in r to judge alpha diversity of microbial community beta diversity of microbial community was judged by the principal coordinate analysis pcoa by calculating bray curtis similarity matrix with the vegdist function in vegan and visualized with ggplot2 16s rrna genes were identified with phyloflash v2 0 and quantified based on the mapped reads percentage and database hits the picante r package was firstly used to calculate the mean nearest taxon distance metric βmntd 33 then a null modeling was implemented to calculate the β nearest taxon index βnti 34 35 βnti 2 means the heterogeneous selection of deterministic processes βnti 2 indicates the homogeneous selection of deterministic processes βnti 2 indicates the stochastic processes of the community assemble 2 9 correlation analysis of functional genes and args opening reading frames orfs were predicted using prodigal v2 6 3 36 and translated into protein sequences using emboss v6 6 0 37 eggnog mapper v2 1 5 was used to perform functional annotation of translated protein sequences 38 in diamond mode against the eggnog 5 0 database 39 with an e value threshold of 10 5 the correlations between the gene richness within each functional category cog and args and shannon index were calculated using spearman s correlations in addition antioxidant system genes including catalase genes and superoxide dismutase sod genes nitrogen metabolism related genes that were capable of degrading antibiotics by co metabolism such as ammonia monooxygenase amo genes denitrification related genes dr and cytochrome p450 coding genes cyp450 were selected and their correlations to args were calculated by using spearman s correlations 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performances for c n and smx removal during 170 days of operation the reactor exhibited a good performance on the removal of cod nh4 n no3 no2 and smx effluent cod of the reactor was always 130 mg l with the cod removal rate higher than 87 fig 1a it is noted that cod removal performance was not affected when the concentration of smx increased from 500 to 750 μg l indicating the good anti interference performance of ags to antibiotic the average concentrations of nh4 n and no2 in effluent were 1 41 the removal rate of nh4 n is 98 25 and 3 01 mg l respectively during the entire run cycle fig 1b although the no3 in effluent was 20 mg l during the first 40 days it kept below 10 mg l after the formation of ags which indicated a good denitrification performance moreover although the smx in influent increased from 500 to 750 μg l the removal rate of smx was always higher than 96 during the 170 days operation fig 1c it is notable that the smx removal rate was even higher than 99 after the formation of ags all the results above showed that ags can simultaneously remove c n and antibiotic and exhibited a good anti interference performance ags formation depend on the skeleton function of filamentous bacteria and adhesion of eps producing bacteria 18 and eps was reported can protect bacteria from antibiotic toxicity 19 20 in addition ags harbor aerobic and anoxic zones from outside to inside and perform simultaneously nitrification and denitrification 21 which have been reported degrading antibiotics by co metabolism 22 24 therefore eps producer and nitrogen metabolism bacteria on the outer sphere of ags can protect microorganism in the inner space from antibiotic pressure which may contribute to args enrichment mitigation as for the whole microbiota 3 2 distribution of args in time and space of the reactor to investigate the distribution of arg in time and space of the reactor we collected samples at different time points and separately quantify sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 in flocs the whole ags and outer and inner portions of ags at the 164th day at which time the average particle size of ags was 2000 μm fig s1 by qpcr the bacterial 16s rrna gene increased from 3 69 0 43 108 in seed sludge to 1 18 0 11 109 copies per ng dna in ags at the 164th day fig 2a suggesting a significant biomass increasing in ags it is worth noting that ags has a higher total bacteria number than flocs at the same time which accords with the previous report that ags exhibits many advantages such as high biomass retention outstanding settleability and greater tolerance to toxins 40 under the selection pressure of smx gene sul1 increased over the time as expected fig 2b however the number of gene sul1 in flocs was much more than that in ags at the 164th day and the outer ags owned the most abundant gene sul1 while the inner ags owned the least similarly the ratio of sul1 to 16s rrna had a same trend with gene sul1 copies fig 2c which indicates ags indeed mitigate arg enrichment it may be due to the inner ags could avoid antibiotic pressure with the protection of the outer ags obviously arg enriched in the outer ags because it was in direct contact with antibiotics however ags has a tight compact structure which can prevent antibiotics migrate to the inside of ags and thus protect the inner bacteria from antibiotic toxicity 19 20 based on the metagenomic sequencing and resistome identification there were 94 102 70 144 113 111 and 102 orfs identified as args in these 7 samples compared with seed sludge args in all samples increased except for the sample on day 100 it may be due that settling time decreased to promote the formation of ags and thus resulted in the massive loss of incompact sludge both total and each drug class of args were most in flocs at the 164th day fig 2d especially multi drug resistance mdr aminoglycoside and tetracycline args which were selected directed by antibiotics fed from the influent it is notable that the inner ags harbored the least arg subtypes among the three ags source samples which suggested again that args were less enriched in the inner ags in all 7 samples antibiotic efflux was the main resistance mechanism fig 2e which can t alter the antibiotic molecular structure antibiotic inactivation that inactivates the drug by adding specific chemical moieties to the compound or that destroy the molecule itself was followed 3 3 ags has greater arg independent antibiotic tolerance ags was considered as a special type of biofilm and have been used to treat toxic organic chemicals due to its high tolerance to toxicity 17 to investigate the effects of granule structure on antibiotic pressure intact and crushed ags were separately exposed to antibiotic with different concentrations as shown in fig 3a the 16s rrna gene copies representing live bacteria in flocs decreased sharply from 2 42 108 to 1 44 108 copies ng dna with the increase of antibiotic concentration from 0 to 5 mg l in contrast the falling range of the live bacteria was much less in ags it is interesting that the ratio of sul1 to 16s rrna in live bacteria of ags was much less than that in live bacteria of flocs fig 3b which suggested that bacteria in ags harbored greater arg independent antibiotic tolerance eps was reported to be an effective barrier for microbial cells to resist antibiotic stress in activated sludges 41 42 based on the sem image ags has a compact surface fig 3c and bacteria are tightly held together by secretions fig 3d in addition extracellular polysaccharides and proteins in the extracted eps were measured separately fig 3e and it was observed that both polysaccharides and proteins were more in ags than that in flocs these results indicate that polysaccharides and proteins may play an important role on relieving the selection pressures of antibiotics it has been reported that various redox active components in epss of sludge provide plentiful binding sites for organic micropollutants and present an important adaptive mechanism of bacterial cells to lower pollutant toxicity 43 44 for example eps can relieve the selection pressure of antibiotics and the extracellular proteins by providing diverse sites to bind with antibiotics to prevente their penetration 20 42 therefore the eps produced by ags may prevent antibiotic move into the inner space and thus mitigate args enrichment 3 4 deterministic mechanisms drive ags bacterial community assembles in a direction that s more protective against antibiotic toxicity a growing body of research has indicated that bacteria community composition plays an important role on the resistome shaping 45 46 therefore it is important to reveal the community assembly mechanism of aerobic granulation process from the start up to ags maturation alpha diversity of bacteria community decreased first due to habitat specialization of the reactor conditions and then increased due to the exogenous microbes input with influent fig 4a among all biosamples ags had the highest alpha diversity which forebode the higher metabolism diversity beta diversity analysis showed that bacterial community structure of seed sludge far differed from others which indicated bacterial community structure changed dramatically over time it is notable that bacterial community structures of three ags samples differ from flocs even though they were collected at the same time and the inner ags had a distinct community from the other two ags samples fig 4b these results suggested that the morphology of sludge and spatial distribution of ags play an important role on microbial community compositions which may further influence the resistome to further clarify the processes and mechanisms of community assembly of sludge in the reactor the null model and neutral community model were used to assess the relative contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes to shaping ags microbial communities it was found that community shaping between flocs at the 164th day and seed sludge sludge at the 35th and 100th day was determined by stochastic processes βnti 2 fig 4c however deterministic forces heterogeneous selection drove community shaping between ags and seed sludge sludge at the 35th day and flocs at the 164th day βnti 2 fig 4c and the deterministic selection contain multiple mechanisms such as abiotic environmental filtering and biotic interactions 47 on one hand antibiotic selection pressure is one of important abiotic filtering factors and was previously reported to be an important factor for performance and microbial community of ags 48 in this study toxic pollutants may induce the secretion of eps 41 leading to ags formation as a barrier for bacteria to resist antibiotics in turn in addition stochastic processes became more evident with the decrease of the selection pressures 49 therefore antibiotic toxicity may play an important role on dominating the deterministic community assemble of ags by abiotic filtering on the other hand inherent underlying mechanisms of aerobic granulation may also play a role on this deterministic community assemble process by biotic interactions although there is no consensus on the underlying mechanisms for aerobic granulation 17 filamentous or rod like bacteria and eps producers etc were deemed to be essential for granular formation in our system the well known rod shaped eps secreting zoogloea 50 and thauera 51 were more abundant in ags samples than that in flocs at the 164th day fig 4d however amaricoccus a genus capable of producing high levels of exocellular capsular materials to induce poor settleability of activated sludge 52 was much more dominant in flocs compared to ags therefore different skeleton bacteria in ags and flocs spontaneously attract corresponding interactive partners and more eps producers in ags could protect their partners against antibiotic toxicity 3 5 deterministic community assembles of ags enhance arg independent antibiotic resistance and the abundance of antibiotics degradation genes microbial community assembly processes are determined to community compositions and further influence community function bacterial communities differing in potential community functional traits were inferred from metagenomic sequencing and the correlations between these functional traits and args were further calculated genes associated with dna replication recombination and repair extracellular structures energy production and conversion and intracellular trafficking secretion and vesicular transport were positively related to arg abundance the upper half part of fig 5 dna replication recombination and repair constitute an important adaptive mechanism such as antibiotic resistance in bacteria 53 and bacteria could enhance the acquirement of args exogenously by upregulating these functional genes under selection pressures 54 therefore much less replication recombination and repair related genes in ags samples only 0 71 to 0 79 times to seed sludge than that in flocs 1 16 times to seed sludge indicated that antibiotic exert less selective pressure on ags this may explain why ags can mitigate args enrichment likewise the abundances of genes coding extracellular structures which mainly contained pilus that may mediate horizontal gene transfer of args 55 was the least in the inner ags sample 1 15 times higher than seed sludge and the most in flocs 1 41 times higher than seed sludge which indicated less potential of the inner ags to transfer args furthermore oxidative damage stimulating the overproduction of ros is one of important triggers to induce antibiotic susceptible microbes to acquire args exogenously 54 55 bacteria can avoid this oxidative damage by defense mechanisms such as dna binding ferritin like protein mediated oxidative damage protectant 56 the thioredoxin antioxidant system 57 ros scavenger carotenoid biosynthesis 58 59 and so on higher abundance of these functional genes the half bottom of fig 5 related to defense mechanisms and secondary metabolites biosynthesis mentioned above in ags may explain why ags harbor less args further analysis of the relationship between antioxidant systems and arg abundance showed that arg abundance was negatively correlated with catalase and sod gene abundance fig 6a and both catalase and sod genes were the least in flocs at the 164th day which harbored the most args fig 6b and c these results suggested that ags may mitigate args hgt and thus reduce the args enrichment by ros scavenging with antioxidant system as we know ags harbor aerobic and anoxic zones and can achieve simultaneous nitrification and denitrification 21 nowadays a growing body of researches has reported that antibiotics could be degraded with nitrification and denitrification by co metabolism and ammonia monooxygenase genes amoa nitrate reductase genes and cytochrome p450 genes were the main functional genes on the co metabolism processes 22 24 for example smx could be degraded by ammonia oxidizing bacteria and this degradation stopped with the presence of amo inhibitor allylthiourea 22 theoretically degradation could lead to the reduction of antibiotic concentration and selection pressure and thus mitigate the enrichment of args in accordance with this trend arg abundance was negatively correlated with all the amoa nitrate reductase genes and cytochrome p450 genes abundance in our system fig 6a which suggested that the more the n metabolic genes the less args all the three functional genes were more abundant in ags samples than that in flocs at the same time fig 6d e and f which indicated antibiotics may be degraded by co metabolism in ags and thus mitigate args enrichment by decreasing the selection pressure from antibiotics 3 6 mechanisms of ags mitigating args enrichment based on the degradation of antibiotic args quantification and resistome identification eps measurement community assembles and correlations between args and functional genes we propose the underlying mechanisms of ags mitigating args enrichment by arg independent approaches fig 7 firstly eps were produced by bacteria in ags and they may serve as a barrier and prevent antibiotics move into the inner space of ags e g binding antibiotic to extracellular proteins thus protect bacteria from antibiotic toxicity secondly community assembles of ags was founded driven by deterministic forces heterogeneous selection which shift community in a direction that s more protective against antibiotic toxicity thirdly dense aggregates of ags can inhibit antibiotics migrate into the inner space of ags and thus decrease the selection pressures to bacteria in the inner ags fourthly unique aerobic and anoxic partitions of ags 22 24 and the high abundance of nitrogen metabolism genes in ags especially in the outer surface of ags could degrade antibiotics by co metabolism through nitrification and denitrification and thus reduce the selection pressures of bacteria in the ags particulally for these in the inner space of sludge in contrast bacteria in floccular sludge fully exposure to antibiotics and have no such multicellular strategies to resist antibiotics and they must develop amr to survive under antibiotic selection pressures 4 conclusion in this study the role of ags on arg enrichment mitigation during smx biodegradation were examined it was demonstrated that ags exhibited a good performance for smx removal at the loading of 750 μg l the abundance of args in the inner ags was 73 7 and 76 9 lower than that in flocs and the outer ags respectively the mechanism of this result involved the protection roles of dense aggregated structure of ags and the abundant eps that could prevent antibiotic transfer into the inner space of ags further microbial community analysis indicated that the deterministic bacterial community assemble βnti 2 contribute ags to accumulate eps producers further functional gene analysis indicated that n metabolic genes was negatively correlated with args which revealed that antibiotic co metabolic degradation could decrease selection pressures and thus mitigate the arg enrichment these results comprehensively revealed the influence mechanisms of ags on arg enrichment

12594,water shortage severely impacts drought stricken regions with estimates indicating that almost half a billion people are affected yearly composites of salt and porous matrix cspms are promising functional materials for water vapor sorption here cspms were synthesized by loading sapo 34 porous crystals with highly hygroscopic salts namely licl and cacl2 individually mono salt systems or combined binary salt systems to enhance water sorption capacity and cyclability the licl and cacl2 content in the impregnation solution impacted the sorption behavior and equilibrium capacity of the resulting composites physicochemical morphological textural and sorption properties were evaluated showing that the confinement of binary salts yielded the highest water uptake 0 88 gw gads at 25 c and 90 rh which was four times higher than that of the parent sapo 34 the shape of the obtained water vapor isotherms revealed that the salts introduced into the porous structure led to significant changes in the sorption mechanism with sapo 34 following a langmuir behavior type i isotherm and the composites a type ii isotherm with associated multilayer formation due to the presence of the salts kinetic studies also revealed that the materials follow a pso model dominated by water surface interactions embedding different salts into the same hosting pores to support atmospheric water harvesting was therefore found to enhance capacity and cyclability compared to single inorganic porous structures toward more efficient water sorption processes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords porous materials alpos atmospheric water generation sorption composites of salt and porous matrix data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction large geographical regions are nowadays severely affected by water shortage problems with up to 4 billion people living in water stressed areas for at least a month per year while another half a billion people are severely affected by water shortage all year round 1 2 although technologies have been developed to address water scarcity primarily through desalination 3 the absence of direct access to water sources in many landlocked countries and the excessive operating costs have hampered technological deployment 4 5 freshwater transportation over long distances remains costly and unsustainable leaving over 783 million people in these areas without access to safe drinking water 6 7 atmospheric water harvesting awh has emerged as a promising approach for decentralized water production to tackle these challenges 8 the amount of water in the atmosphere in the form of vapor or droplets is estimated to be 13 1018 m3 thirteen quintillions 9 which is regenerated through the hydrological cycle every 12 days 6 a challenge however lies with the need to develop appropriate technologies to support the capture ability the ease of release of this atmospheric water demanded energy and scaling up the amount of produced water solar energy and adsorption can be employed for the large scale production of freshwater 10 suitable materials must have hydrothermal stability high capacity fast kinetics and reusability for many adsorption desorption cycles without losing their sorption capability 11 13 activated alumina zeolites aluminophosphates aerogels graphene and metal organic frameworks mofs are among the main materials trialled to date for atmospheric water harvesting 14 16 sapo 34 is a crystalline silicoaluminophosphate zeolitic framework with a chabazite phase structure used as a desiccant in air coolers and dehumidifiers the crystalline structure of zeo type materials facilitates water adsorption even at low humidity levels while the silicon aluminium ratio inside their framework can be tuned to control the water vapor adsorption capability 17 18 chemical sorbents such as hygroscopic salts offer higher water uptake capacity than physical sorbents due to the hydration reaction during chemisorption nevertheless these sorbents present several challenges including issues related to corrosion or swelling and a tendency for agglomeration known to reduce the water sorption capacity and sorption kinetics after one cycle 3 19 in order to take advantage of high water uptake of salts and tackle the associated challenges composite of salt and porous matrix cspms were introduced for sorption based awh cspms are composite sorbents that inhibit agglomeration and salt solution leakage in sorption based heating cooling systems and awh 3 the water sorption characteristics packing density kinetics regeneration temperature and stability can be significantly altered by adequately combining the individual components involving a hygroscopic salt and a parent matrix by altering the nature and properties of the components as a result while hygroscopic salts may boost the sorption capacity of the composite the porous matrix can also eliminate swelling and deliquescence issues caused by the solvation of the salts 20 21 cspms containing different types of mono or binary salts and porous materials such as cacl2 silica gel libr silica gel cacl2 mcm 41 and cacl2 sba 15 have been investigated and found to improve water adsorption capacity by 12 up to 40 2 22 particularly when calcium chloride was incorporated in the mesopores of silica gel it was found to greatly enhance water adsorption capacity by 37 and control salt deliquescence 23 24 the performance of mesoporous iron silicate at high relative water vapor pressure was reported to be tripled when the material was impregnated with calcium chloride 2 1 m solution 20 25 also a variety of inorganic salts as licl cacl2 and libr into porous matrices have been incorporated in other structures such as mofs to investigate the sorption capacities of the prepared composites 20 26 combining multiple salts such as chloride with bromide salts in the same pores was also found to significantly enhance the water capture capacity and the overall cspms properties 22 27 28 for instance adding lithium chloride with lithium bromide in silica gel by wet impregnation technique increased the water uptake by 12 7 while the lithium bromide alone increased the sorption capacity by only 5 5 22 in this work the micropores of sapo 34 were employed to immobilize mono and binary salts toward the formation of sapo 34 based cspms the effects of the concentration and mass ratios of mono and binary salt impregnation on the surface area pore characteristics structural properties and composite performance were thoroughly investigated adsorption isotherms and kinetic models were developed to demonstrate how salt loadings influence materials sorption and desorption behavior this work opens avenues for designing new hybrid materials for awg which will be able to take advantage of the good water sorption ability of hygroscopic salts and at the same time limit structural deliquescent behavior 2 experimental section 2 1 materials all chemicals were used as obtained without any modifications calcium chloride anhydrous 99 sigma aldrich lithium chloride anhydrous 99 sigma aldrich and sapo 34 molecular sieve was sourced from intelligent materials pvt ltd 2 2 methods sapo 34 was impregnated with mono salts to prepare the cspms and study the effect of impregnation of each salt alone in the host matrix and the concentration of the impregnation solution of each salt on the behavior of the resulting composite calcium chloride or lithium chloride impregnated samples were prepared using four different salt concentrations in the impregnation solution with 20 30 40 and 50 wt for the binary salt systems based on the results obtained from the mono salt systems a 40 wt was selected as a fixed total salt concentration in the impregnation solution then nine samples with different cacl2 licl relative mass ratios were prepared as shown in table 1 prior to impregnation the sapo 34 was activated at 300 c for 3 h the activated sapo 34 was placed in the prepared salt solution and left under stirring for 24 h after filtering the sample was washed with 50 ml of deionized water and dried at 150 c for 12 h 2 3 characterization fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was performed using a bruker vertex 70 ftir spectrophotometer in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 64 scans were collected at a 4 cm 1 resolution baseline correction was performed after background acquisition x ray diffraction analysis was carried out on a bruker d2 phaser the diffraction patterns were collected within a 2θ range of 4 70 with a step size 0 02 using a zero background holder thermogravimetric analysis tga was done using the discovery tga at temperatures between 50 and 400 c with a heating rate of 10 c min under n2 a fei quanta 250 feg coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds capability was used to obtain scanning electron microscopy sem images at 10 kv voltage and a working distance of 12 mm before sem the samples were mounted on aluminium stubs covered with carbon tape and 5 nm of gold and perform eds analysis on the samples at 20 kv voltage and a working distance of 12 mm each powder sample was fixed onto standard aluminium sem stub by the help of a carbon tape a micromeritics 3flex adsorption analyzer micromeritics instruments corporation usa was used to evaluate the textural characteristics of the adsorbents and determine their surface area and porosity using ultra pure nitrogen gas 99 99 at 77 k with equilibration interval of 10 s in relative pressure p po range 0 to 0 99 the brunauer emmet teller bet method was used to calculate the surface area the measurements were performed after degassing the samples overnight at 250 c under vacuum 2 4 water vapors adsorption studies a 3flex micromeritics volumetric adsorption analyzer micromeritics instruments corporation usa coupled with a temperature controlled analysis manifold with a vapor source was used to study the ability of the prepared sorbents to capture water vapor over a broad relative pressure p po range 0 to 0 9 and to investigate the water adsorption desorption isotherms a julabo laboratory thermostat was used to control the operating temperature throughout the measurement the samples were degassed at 250 c for 3 h prior to the adsorption measurements cyclability was evaluated by applying consecutive sorption desorption cycles where a sample was hydrated and dried at 100 c for 8 h before repeating the procedure 3 results and discussion the impact of varying the concentration and mass ratios of mono and binary salt impregnation on the physicochemical morphological textural and sorption properties of the composites were thoroughly investigated adsorption isotherm modelling and kinetic models were developed to demonstrate how salt loadings influence the sorption and desorption behavior of materials while cyclability tests revealed the long term stability of the systems 3 1 characterization of the composite adsorbents the morphology of sapo 34 and related cspms was investigated by sem image analysis sapo 34 crystals exhibit a cuboid shaped morphology compatible with the cha type zeolite structure 29 31 fig 1 a and cspms fig 1 b e the preservation of the shape of zeolite particles suggests that the incorporation of salts within the porous matrix did not significantly affect the morphology the atomic percentages for the salt elements in the cspms impregnated with mono salts i e cacl2 or licl respectively fig s1 a and b were determined by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds the atomic of ca and cl atoms in samples prepared with different concentrations of cacl2 solutions reveals that the percentage of the salt elements increases with increasing the concentration in the impregnation solution fig s1 a for the samples impregnated with licl fig s1 b following the cl profile a similar trend is observed no data is shown for li as eds is unable to determine its presence 6 in addition eds analysis of the cspms confirmed the presence of al o si and p the main elements present in the sapo 34 crystals fig s1 c as confirmed by xrd sem and eds analyses the salt is well encapsulated inside the cages of the sapo 34 matrix yet at high impregnation solution concentrations 50 wt fig 1 e and confirmed by xrd the scarcity of sharpened edges of crystals and the formation of agglomerates between zeolite particles occurs accounting for the increased existence of salt particles within the interparticle pores and on the outer surface of the crystals of the host matrix and their swelling behavior 32 fig 2 a and b show the xrd patterns of the host sapo 34 and the salt impregnated composites the pattern of sapo 34 presents the characteristic peaks at 7 6 33 10 1 34 12 4 35 16 03 33 21 2 33 24 2 35 27 2 36 30 1 34 and 34 3 37 confirming the cha structure for the framework and indicating high crystallinity 17 34 37 all the characteristic peaks of sapo 34 were present within the hybrid structures confirming that salt impregnation did not cause any distortion or alteration to the host framework crystallinity notably none of the calcium chloride or lithium chloride salt peaks were present across the patterns of the composites prepared using salt solutions with concentrations up to 40 wt cs40 and ls40 indicating that salt particles were well confined in the host crystals inner pores the washing step successfully prevented the excess or bulk salts particles from settling or agglomerating on the outer surface of parent crystals making them undetectable by xrd some residual salt particles might be present in the nanoscale amorphous phase which were not big enough crystalline hydrates to be detected by xrd 20 consequently the 40 wt total salt concentration was selected as the maximum concentration that can be used to prepare the binary salt cspms table 1 to avoid issues caused by the presence and agglomeration of salts on the outer surface of crystals similarly all binary cspms fig s2 showed only the characteristic peaks of a sapo 34 framework without evidence of peaks attributed to bulk salts or peak shifts cs50 and ls50 samples corresponding to higher salt concentration 50 wt or above the xrd peaks for the salts also appeared across the patterns of the composites revealing the existence of salt hydrates agglomerated out of pores on the outer surface of the sapo 34 crystals fig 1 in this case the washing step was insufficient to remove excess salt settled out of pores 9 38 furthermore the presence of salts in high concentration induced a slight shift of the sapo 34 peaks to higher angles in cs50 and ls50 samples a fact that is more pronounced in ls50 indicating that salts in such high loading concentration start interacting and altering the crystalline characteristics of the framework or it may be indicative of the formation of a solid solution 28 the ftir spectra of all materials are shown in figs 2 c f and s3 the spectrum of sapo 34 shows the characteristic bands for the cha structure at 460 550 660 980 and 1100 cm 1 corresponding to the internal vibration of tetrahedral to4 units t si or al different 6 membered ring vibrations po4 symmetric stretching vibrations of alosi siosi and symmetric opo stretches respectively 17 37 peaks at 1635 and 3730 cm 1 indicate the presence of hydroxyl groups in the double 6 ring d6r 39 42 and can also be attributed to the physiosorbed moisture from surroundings into the sapo 34 matrix the ftir spectra of the cspms fig 2 c and f showed a broad band between 3250 and 3500 cm 1 and bands related to hydroxyl group peaks of structural water near 1654 1150 and 980 cm 1 in samples with high salt contents confirming the presence of water and their water affinity 3 samples with higher salt contents showed a broader oh band with high intensities indicating their higher affinity for water sorption than pure sapo 34 and samples with low salt content 43 46 the bands observed for the composite sorbents match the pure sapo 34 with the addition of bands related to the presence of water supporting the conclusion that there is no chemical interaction between sapo 34 and the impregnated salts 42 45 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of sapo 34 and the highest performing cspms cs40 ls40 and cls2 are presented in fig s4 the sapo 34 powder exhibited a type i isotherm with a negligible hysteresis loop indicative of exclusive microporous nature 39 the isotherms of the cspms were similar yet the adsorption capacity was lower confirming the presence of the salt crystals within the pores reducing available surface area table 2 lists the textural properties of the sorbents the pore size of the cspms sorbents increased compared to sapo 34 whereas the specific surface area and pore volume decreased confirming that impregnating hygroscopic salts cause partial blocking of pores 2 tga analysis was performed for mono salt impregnated cspms to evaluate the thermal stability and dehydration of the parent porous matrix and the developed cspms the results of the sapo 34 and its composites are presented in fig 3 for sapo 34 there was no noticeable weight drop up to 100 c the first weight loss was observed in the temperature range of 110 190 c which may be attributed to the removal of adsorbed water and molecules trapped in the inner cages of the zeolite structure 36 47 significant weight drops were recorded for the composites including in the region of up to 100 c which indicates that a significant amount of water is withheld within the salt in sapo 34 hybrid structures as shown in fig 3 c the weight drops with the increase in the salt content thus the amount of trapped water increases with the salt content this behavior can be explained by the high affinity of the impregnated hygroscopic salts to interact with water via various hydration steps thus dehydration occurs via multi steps including the first dehydration phase of cacl2 6 h2o to cacl2 4 h2o to dehydration to the anhydrate the same trend is shown in samples impregnated with licl 48 3 2 water capture performance the water adsorption isotherms of sapo 34 and its cspms at 25 c are shown in fig 4 the isotherm of the pure sapo 34 indicates a single adsorption step at the low relative pressure range type i isotherm which is a characteristic behavior of microporous solids indicating strong interaction potential between the water molecules and the micropore walls beyond this pressure range no additional water can be adsorbed across the bare sapo 34 due to the saturation of the available adsorption sites 49 while cspms samples follow type ii isotherm due to the effect of salt hydration that results in enhancing water uptake at higher p po 50 in the presence of salts however the adsorption capacity of the materials increases significantly through the hydration of the licl and cacl2 salts within the pores the hybrid sorbents undergo multi event processes involving chemisorption deliquescence and solution absorption at various partial water pressures the distinguishable steps can be evidenced by the respective inflection points in the isotherms of water sorption water clusters form initially near to the wall of pores and around the salt hydrates up to a point where liquid absorption begins and continues by increasing pressure a strong interaction between salts and water vapor leads to an increase in water sorption and possible decantation of salt solution from the pores 2 3 22 for cspms with low salt content and at low relative humidity the isotherm behavior of pure sapo 34 still relatively dominates their sorption behavior however the salt hydration effect dominates with raising its weight concentration cspms with higher salt content led to a higher hydration effect which impeded the isotherm of the hosting sapo 34 although the cs50 and ls50 samples show the highest water sorption capacities among the single salt samples we did not use this concentration in preparing the binary salt ones instead solutions with total salt concentration of 40 wt were used for impregnating the binary samples based on the xrd analysis fig 2 a and b which indicated that among the samples prepared the maximum solution concentration that yields solely the sapo 34 peaks without peaks attributed to salts that would indicate their bulk clustering outside the alpo pores is 40 wt the samples impregnated with salt solutions of higher concentration 50 wt contain bulk salt particles located outside the pores that would lead to unwanted deliquescent behavior and recyclability issues as a result the 40 salt solution concentration was chosen as the total salt concentration for preparing the binary salt samples in the latter different relative weight ratios of the two salts were used fig 4 c shows the complete cycle adsorption desorption isotherms of the binary salt impregnated cspm prepared using a cacl2 to licl relative weight ratio of 2 8 cls2 in comparison to the respective mono salt samples cs40 ls40 of same total salt concentration 40 wt as seen the binary system outperforms the two single salt ones confirming the synergetic action of the two salts combined within the pores toward enhancing the water sorption since the physical and chemical characteristics of cspms were indeed improved by adding the second salt to the impregnation solution the binary salt system experienced changes in its sorption equilibrium compared to the mono salt composites due to a solid salt solution forming inside the pores and as a result the equilibrium of the solvation was affected by the formation of the homogeneous solid solution 22 27 a comparison of the water sorption performance among the binary salt samples impregnated using different cacl2 to licl relative weight ratios is shown in fig s5 it can be observed that the water uptake of binary samples impregnated with solutions with higher licl cacl2 concentration ratio 9 1 8 2 and 7 3 is higher than that of the pure licl impregnated salt sample at a higher rh the highest increase in uptake is observed for the cls2 sample with 8licl 2cacl2 ratio indeed capacities start decreasing compared to the mono salt licl sample with decreasing licl content starting from a licl cacl2 relative ratio of 6 4 and keep declining with lower licl cacl2 relative ratios however the capacities are still higher compared to the mono salt cacl2 sample the observed trend and the location of the maximum water uptake is further shown by the comparison histogram of fig 4 d which displays the equilibrium sorption capacities of the binary salt cspms at 25 c and 90 rh adding cacl2 together with licl enhances the water uptake up to 0 88 g g for sample cls2 with a licl cacl2 ratio of 8 2 indeed this water uptake is four times higher than that of the untreated sapo 34 at 90 rh owing to the optimum synergy between the two slats in the pores and the possible formation of solid salt solution further decrease in licl content reduces the capacity due to the dominant role of the less sorbing cacl2 salt to better understand the water adsorption mechanism of our new materials the experimental data of sapo 34 and the best performing mono and binary cspms cs40 ls40 and cls2 were next fitted to the langmuir isotherm model fig 5 the langmuir model fits well the pure sapo 34 isotherm experimental data suggesting that adsorption in sapo 34 occurs on equivalent adsorption sites forming a monolayer as expected due to the isotherm shape the langmuir model doesn t fit the experimental data for cs40 ls40 and cls2 the mechanism occurring with these materials is unequal to the one observed for sapo 34 other models such as sips freundlich and frenkel halsey hill were used to fit the experimental data fig s6 and table s2 leading to poor fittings sapo 34 isotherm follows a type i shape concordant with the good langmuir fitting supporting the conclusion that there is no multilayer adsorption for the other materials type ii isotherms are observed with an inflection point showing the occurrence of multi step sorption and interactions due to the domination of salt hydration at higher vapor pressures the inflection point is often accepted as the point at which the parent sapo 34 behavior mono layer formation less significative and multi events related to salts start for instance cs40 isotherm shape reveals a first distinguishable step in which it behaves similar to the parent sapo 34 in pure phase followed by multi events and chemo physio interactions with a different shape dominated by the hydration of salt in the inner pores leading to the formation of multilayers and capillary condensation similar behavior is observed in the ls40 isotherm nevertheless the dominancy of the sapo 34 adsorption mechanism is less significative fig 5 c suggesting that the presence of lithium salt does not need such a complete monolayer formation to induce the salt uptake capacity this is further confirmed by the cls2 isotherm shape where the presence of the first step is almost neglected fig 5 d the water is adsorbed through the materials and salts almost immediately 3 3 water vapor sorption kinetics to compare the materials and their uptake capability we performed kinetics studies investigating the water vapor adsorption kinetics of the cspms at p pₒ of 0 8 at 25 c fig 6 a the experimental data were treated using describes the linear driving force ldf model first order kinetics model and the pseudo second order pso model according to ldf the driving force behind adsorption is the difference in concentration between the adsorbed phases and bulk external intraparticle and intramicropore resistances to mass transport are all grouped together as a single diffusional barrier 51 52 1 qt q 1 exp keff t where t water adsorption time min keff mass transfer coefficient 1 min 1 qt water vapor adsorption at time t and q maximum water vapor adsorption capacity the pso model assumes that surface interactions mainly control the entire adsorption process it is also based on the assumption that the adsorption rate is related to the square of the number of available adsorption sites and it is described by eq 2 2 qt q 2 kpt 1 q kpt where t water adsorption time min kp adsorption rate constant l mol 1 min 1 qt water vapor adsorption at time t and q maximum water vapor adsorption capacity ldf and pso fitting showed good concordance with the experimental data fig 7 the residuals obtained for the models were compared fig s7 and the pso model led to better results the mechanism seems to be dominated by surface interactions which are concordant with the equilibrium studies water uptake is primarily dominated by the water interaction with the starting material sapo 34 the water uptake of cspms increases significantly faster in the early sorption period due to hydration and chemisorption due to the presence of the salt particles and the high relative humidity applied however the sapo 34 reached its equilibrium capacity value faster than the salt impregnated samples owing to the salt content in the pores of the latter samples which caused diffusion hindrance thus requiring a prolonged time to reach equilibrium furthermore the sorption in the impregnated salt samples occurs through both physisorption and chemisorption increasing the time to achieve sorption equilibrium finally limited dissipation of the generated heat of sorption due to the loading of the pores with salt is anticipated to affect the sorption kinetics the kinetic parameters obtained by the fittings are shown in table 3 sapo 34 had a higher k value than the samples impregnated with salt confirming that the adsorption rate in pure sapo 34 is higher than in the impregnated samples 53 54 the maximum water vapor adsorption capacity q increased with the impregnation of the salt s inner pores of the materials lithium impregnation showed a more significant improvement in the maximum water adsorption capacity three times higher than sapo 34 the introduction of the two salts lithium and calcium have a synergic effect on the water adsorption capacity increasing q value around 4 times to benchmark our work table 4 summarizes some cspms that have been recently developed for atmospheric water sorption applications all the values of water uptakes used for the purpose of comparison are obtained from the experimental results of the related work for instance silica gel impregnated with cacl2 and licl was found to exhibit enhanced water adsorption with a capacity value of 0 67 gw g and 0 7 gw g respectively table 4 entry 4 and 3 compared to pure silica 0 4 gw g 55 in addition the water uptake was found to be improved for many adsorbents such as mofs and hollow carbon with the loading of the impregnated salts specifically cacl2 and licl to reach a water uptake of 1 gw g table 4 entries 1 and 2 the resulting cspms outperformed adsorbents such as fam z01 fam z02 silica gel and certain mofs 56 compared to known cspms the binary cls2 sapo 34 cacl2 licl developed in this work exhibits a significant sorption capacity and the impregnation of binary salts inside the sapo 34 host shows a significant enhancement in the water uptake which was four times higher than that of the parent sapo 34 additionally salt impregnation aimed to stabilize and prevent the swelling of the impregnated hygroscopic salts taking advantage of the fact that the crystalline rigid and ordered structure of sapo 34 can limit the amount of salt that may leak out of its pores in addition the produced cls2 showed a moderate regeneration temperature 100 c in contrast to many other reported cspms exhibiting higher regeneration temperatures furthermore the developed cspms can work efficiently in moderate and very low relative humidities for instance the optimized sample cls2 can uptake 0 2 g g at 10 rh and 0 32 g g at 20 rh while the other mono and binary impregnated samples that were developed showed enhanced water uptake at rhs higher than 10 compared to pure sapo 34 as well as many conventional adsorbents the performance of the optimized sample cls2 under various climatic conditions is shown in fig s8 the graph presents the anticipated water uptakes gw gcls2 in various geographical regions demonstrating that the developed cspm can be effectively used for awh even in dry climates the material can collect up to 0 88 kg of water per kg of cls2 in areas with high humidity and 0 27 0 49 kg of water per kg of cls2 in the driest places 17 33 rh on earth 3 4 recyclability evaluation to finalize our study the cyclability of the prepared cspms was tested the best performing binary sample cls2 and the two respective mono salt ones cs40 and ls40 underwent 12 continuous sorption desorption cycles to investigate the cyclic stability regeneration was done at 100 c under vacuum for 8 h evidently the cls2 sample showed high stability as after the 12 cycles the water uptake was reduced by only 2 3 fig 6 b and c in comparison the cs40 and ls40 mono salt samples exhibited a capacity decline of 5 7 and 2 86 respectively which can be attributed to the leaching of salt from the sapo 34 pores particularly cacl2 as well as pore blockage due to the leached out cacl2 this minor reduction in the sorption capacity upon cyclic adsorption desorption confirms the stability of the binary salt impregnated systems it has been demonstrated from results that combining two salts can help improve the sorption behavior compared to the mono impregnated samples and reduced the swelling and deliquescence of salts out of pores 27 28 also the concentration of impregnated salts inside the pores plays a crucial role in avoiding the presence of salt hydrates outside the sapo 34 crystals since impregnating the hosting matrix with excessive salt solutions 40 wt may lead to accumulating salt particles outside the pores promoting the unwanted deliquescence however the salts leakage cannot be entirely prevented and further action will be needed to improve the stability of impregnated salts inside the pores such as binding them to the pore walls furthermore employing modelling to predict when the porous matrix needs to be recharged with salts after a specific number of cycles to put back its original water uptake in addition to determine if the utilized sample s chemical and textural characteristics were altered as a result of the water sorption

sapo 34 porous matrix the composition structure thermal and textural properties of the resulting composites were evaluated and the water sorption performance and cyclability were assessed licl and cacl2 salts were impregnated in the sapo 34 matrix and the resulting cspms exhibited enhanced sorption capacity compared to the pure sapo 34 while the mono licl impregnated materials exhibited higher capacity than the cacl2 ones it was also found that cacl2 leaches from the sapo 34 matrix more readily than licl binary salt systems were also prepared where both salts at various ratios were introduced into the host porous matrix these systems were optimized and exhibited significantly higher water uptake than the mono salt ones of the same total salt concentration due to the synergetic action of the two salts inside the same pores which enhanced water affinity and increased the density of the available sorption sites indeed the cls2 binary material prepared using a cacl2 licl mass ratio of 2 and a 40 wt total salt concentration in the impregnating solution exhibited the highest adsorption capacity of 0 88 gw gads at 25 c and 90 rh the cyclability adsorption desorption tests for the same sample revealed that the material after 12 cycles retained 97 7 of its starting capacity based on performance and stability the developed binary salt porous systems are promising for water

12594,water shortage severely impacts drought stricken regions with estimates indicating that almost half a billion people are affected yearly composites of salt and porous matrix cspms are promising functional materials for water vapor sorption here cspms were synthesized by loading sapo 34 porous crystals with highly hygroscopic salts namely licl and cacl2 individually mono salt systems or combined binary salt systems to enhance water sorption capacity and cyclability the licl and cacl2 content in the impregnation solution impacted the sorption behavior and equilibrium capacity of the resulting composites physicochemical morphological textural and sorption properties were evaluated showing that the confinement of binary salts yielded the highest water uptake 0 88 gw gads at 25 c and 90 rh which was four times higher than that of the parent sapo 34 the shape of the obtained water vapor isotherms revealed that the salts introduced into the porous structure led to significant changes in the sorption mechanism with sapo 34 following a langmuir behavior type i isotherm and the composites a type ii isotherm with associated multilayer formation due to the presence of the salts kinetic studies also revealed that the materials follow a pso model dominated by water surface interactions embedding different salts into the same hosting pores to support atmospheric water harvesting was therefore found to enhance capacity and cyclability compared to single inorganic porous structures toward more efficient water sorption processes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords porous materials alpos atmospheric water generation sorption composites of salt and porous matrix data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction large geographical regions are nowadays severely affected by water shortage problems with up to 4 billion people living in water stressed areas for at least a month per year while another half a billion people are severely affected by water shortage all year round 1 2 although technologies have been developed to address water scarcity primarily through desalination 3 the absence of direct access to water sources in many landlocked countries and the excessive operating costs have hampered technological deployment 4 5 freshwater transportation over long distances remains costly and unsustainable leaving over 783 million people in these areas without access to safe drinking water 6 7 atmospheric water harvesting awh has emerged as a promising approach for decentralized water production to tackle these challenges 8 the amount of water in the atmosphere in the form of vapor or droplets is estimated to be 13 1018 m3 thirteen quintillions 9 which is regenerated through the hydrological cycle every 12 days 6 a challenge however lies with the need to develop appropriate technologies to support the capture ability the ease of release of this atmospheric water demanded energy and scaling up the amount of produced water solar energy and adsorption can be employed for the large scale production of freshwater 10 suitable materials must have hydrothermal stability high capacity fast kinetics and reusability for many adsorption desorption cycles without losing their sorption capability 11 13 activated alumina zeolites aluminophosphates aerogels graphene and metal organic frameworks mofs are among the main materials trialled to date for atmospheric water harvesting 14 16 sapo 34 is a crystalline silicoaluminophosphate zeolitic framework with a chabazite phase structure used as a desiccant in air coolers and dehumidifiers the crystalline structure of zeo type materials facilitates water adsorption even at low humidity levels while the silicon aluminium ratio inside their framework can be tuned to control the water vapor adsorption capability 17 18 chemical sorbents such as hygroscopic salts offer higher water uptake capacity than physical sorbents due to the hydration reaction during chemisorption nevertheless these sorbents present several challenges including issues related to corrosion or swelling and a tendency for agglomeration known to reduce the water sorption capacity and sorption kinetics after one cycle 3 19 in order to take advantage of high water uptake of salts and tackle the associated challenges composite of salt and porous matrix cspms were introduced for sorption based awh cspms are composite sorbents that inhibit agglomeration and salt solution leakage in sorption based heating cooling systems and awh 3 the water sorption characteristics packing density kinetics regeneration temperature and stability can be significantly altered by adequately combining the individual components involving a hygroscopic salt and a parent matrix by altering the nature and properties of the components as a result while hygroscopic salts may boost the sorption capacity of the composite the porous matrix can also eliminate swelling and deliquescence issues caused by the solvation of the salts 20 21 cspms containing different types of mono or binary salts and porous materials such as cacl2 silica gel libr silica gel cacl2 mcm 41 and cacl2 sba 15 have been investigated and found to improve water adsorption capacity by 12 up to 40 2 22 particularly when calcium chloride was incorporated in the mesopores of silica gel it was found to greatly enhance water adsorption capacity by 37 and control salt deliquescence 23 24 the performance of mesoporous iron silicate at high relative water vapor pressure was reported to be tripled when the material was impregnated with calcium chloride 2 1 m solution 20 25 also a variety of inorganic salts as licl cacl2 and libr into porous matrices have been incorporated in other structures such as mofs to investigate the sorption capacities of the prepared composites 20 26 combining multiple salts such as chloride with bromide salts in the same pores was also found to significantly enhance the water capture capacity and the overall cspms properties 22 27 28 for instance adding lithium chloride with lithium bromide in silica gel by wet impregnation technique increased the water uptake by 12 7 while the lithium bromide alone increased the sorption capacity by only 5 5 22 in this work the micropores of sapo 34 were employed to immobilize mono and binary salts toward the formation of sapo 34 based cspms the effects of the concentration and mass ratios of mono and binary salt impregnation on the surface area pore characteristics structural properties and composite performance were thoroughly investigated adsorption isotherms and kinetic models were developed to demonstrate how salt loadings influence materials sorption and desorption behavior this work opens avenues for designing new hybrid materials for awg which will be able to take advantage of the good water sorption ability of hygroscopic salts and at the same time limit structural deliquescent behavior 2 experimental section 2 1 materials all chemicals were used as obtained without any modifications calcium chloride anhydrous 99 sigma aldrich lithium chloride anhydrous 99 sigma aldrich and sapo 34 molecular sieve was sourced from intelligent materials pvt ltd 2 2 methods sapo 34 was impregnated with mono salts to prepare the cspms and study the effect of impregnation of each salt alone in the host matrix and the concentration of the impregnation solution of each salt on the behavior of the resulting composite calcium chloride or lithium chloride impregnated samples were prepared using four different salt concentrations in the impregnation solution with 20 30 40 and 50 wt for the binary salt systems based on the results obtained from the mono salt systems a 40 wt was selected as a fixed total salt concentration in the impregnation solution then nine samples with different cacl2 licl relative mass ratios were prepared as shown in table 1 prior to impregnation the sapo 34 was activated at 300 c for 3 h the activated sapo 34 was placed in the prepared salt solution and left under stirring for 24 h after filtering the sample was washed with 50 ml of deionized water and dried at 150 c for 12 h 2 3 characterization fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was performed using a bruker vertex 70 ftir spectrophotometer in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 64 scans were collected at a 4 cm 1 resolution baseline correction was performed after background acquisition x ray diffraction analysis was carried out on a bruker d2 phaser the diffraction patterns were collected within a 2θ range of 4 70 with a step size 0 02 using a zero background holder thermogravimetric analysis tga was done using the discovery tga at temperatures between 50 and 400 c with a heating rate of 10 c min under n2 a fei quanta 250 feg coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds capability was used to obtain scanning electron microscopy sem images at 10 kv voltage and a working distance of 12 mm before sem the samples were mounted on aluminium stubs covered with carbon tape and 5 nm of gold and perform eds analysis on the samples at 20 kv voltage and a working distance of 12 mm each powder sample was fixed onto standard aluminium sem stub by the help of a carbon tape a micromeritics 3flex adsorption analyzer micromeritics instruments corporation usa was used to evaluate the textural characteristics of the adsorbents and determine their surface area and porosity using ultra pure nitrogen gas 99 99 at 77 k with equilibration interval of 10 s in relative pressure p po range 0 to 0 99 the brunauer emmet teller bet method was used to calculate the surface area the measurements were performed after degassing the samples overnight at 250 c under vacuum 2 4 water vapors adsorption studies a 3flex micromeritics volumetric adsorption analyzer micromeritics instruments corporation usa coupled with a temperature controlled analysis manifold with a vapor source was used to study the ability of the prepared sorbents to capture water vapor over a broad relative pressure p po range 0 to 0 9 and to investigate the water adsorption desorption isotherms a julabo laboratory thermostat was used to control the operating temperature throughout the measurement the samples were degassed at 250 c for 3 h prior to the adsorption measurements cyclability was evaluated by applying consecutive sorption desorption cycles where a sample was hydrated and dried at 100 c for 8 h before repeating the procedure 3 results and discussion the impact of varying the concentration and mass ratios of mono and binary salt impregnation on the physicochemical morphological textural and sorption properties of the composites were thoroughly investigated adsorption isotherm modelling and kinetic models were developed to demonstrate how salt loadings influence the sorption and desorption behavior of materials while cyclability tests revealed the long term stability of the systems 3 1 characterization of the composite adsorbents the morphology of sapo 34 and related cspms was investigated by sem image analysis sapo 34 crystals exhibit a cuboid shaped morphology compatible with the cha type zeolite structure 29 31 fig 1 a and cspms fig 1 b e the preservation of the shape of zeolite particles suggests that the incorporation of salts within the porous matrix did not significantly affect the morphology the atomic percentages for the salt elements in the cspms impregnated with mono salts i e cacl2 or licl respectively fig s1 a and b were determined by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds the atomic of ca and cl atoms in samples prepared with different concentrations of cacl2 solutions reveals that the percentage of the salt elements increases with increasing the concentration in the impregnation solution fig s1 a for the samples impregnated with licl fig s1 b following the cl profile a similar trend is observed no data is shown for li as eds is unable to determine its presence 6 in addition eds analysis of the cspms confirmed the presence of al o si and p the main elements present in the sapo 34 crystals fig s1 c as confirmed by xrd sem and eds analyses the salt is well encapsulated inside the cages of the sapo 34 matrix yet at high impregnation solution concentrations 50 wt fig 1 e and confirmed by xrd the scarcity of sharpened edges of crystals and the formation of agglomerates between zeolite particles occurs accounting for the increased existence of salt particles within the interparticle pores and on the outer surface of the crystals of the host matrix and their swelling behavior 32 fig 2 a and b show the xrd patterns of the host sapo 34 and the salt impregnated composites the pattern of sapo 34 presents the characteristic peaks at 7 6 33 10 1 34 12 4 35 16 03 33 21 2 33 24 2 35 27 2 36 30 1 34 and 34 3 37 confirming the cha structure for the framework and indicating high crystallinity 17 34 37 all the characteristic peaks of sapo 34 were present within the hybrid structures confirming that salt impregnation did not cause any distortion or alteration to the host framework crystallinity notably none of the calcium chloride or lithium chloride salt peaks were present across the patterns of the composites prepared using salt solutions with concentrations up to 40 wt cs40 and ls40 indicating that salt particles were well confined in the host crystals inner pores the washing step successfully prevented the excess or bulk salts particles from settling or agglomerating on the outer surface of parent crystals making them undetectable by xrd some residual salt particles might be present in the nanoscale amorphous phase which were not big enough crystalline hydrates to be detected by xrd 20 consequently the 40 wt total salt concentration was selected as the maximum concentration that can be used to prepare the binary salt cspms table 1 to avoid issues caused by the presence and agglomeration of salts on the outer surface of crystals similarly all binary cspms fig s2 showed only the characteristic peaks of a sapo 34 framework without evidence of peaks attributed to bulk salts or peak shifts cs50 and ls50 samples corresponding to higher salt concentration 50 wt or above the xrd peaks for the salts also appeared across the patterns of the composites revealing the existence of salt hydrates agglomerated out of pores on the outer surface of the sapo 34 crystals fig 1 in this case the washing step was insufficient to remove excess salt settled out of pores 9 38 furthermore the presence of salts in high concentration induced a slight shift of the sapo 34 peaks to higher angles in cs50 and ls50 samples a fact that is more pronounced in ls50 indicating that salts in such high loading concentration start interacting and altering the crystalline characteristics of the framework or it may be indicative of the formation of a solid solution 28 the ftir spectra of all materials are shown in figs 2 c f and s3 the spectrum of sapo 34 shows the characteristic bands for the cha structure at 460 550 660 980 and 1100 cm 1 corresponding to the internal vibration of tetrahedral to4 units t si or al different 6 membered ring vibrations po4 symmetric stretching vibrations of alosi siosi and symmetric opo stretches respectively 17 37 peaks at 1635 and 3730 cm 1 indicate the presence of hydroxyl groups in the double 6 ring d6r 39 42 and can also be attributed to the physiosorbed moisture from surroundings into the sapo 34 matrix the ftir spectra of the cspms fig 2 c and f showed a broad band between 3250 and 3500 cm 1 and bands related to hydroxyl group peaks of structural water near 1654 1150 and 980 cm 1 in samples with high salt contents confirming the presence of water and their water affinity 3 samples with higher salt contents showed a broader oh band with high intensities indicating their higher affinity for water sorption than pure sapo 34 and samples with low salt content 43 46 the bands observed for the composite sorbents match the pure sapo 34 with the addition of bands related to the presence of water supporting the conclusion that there is no chemical interaction between sapo 34 and the impregnated salts 42 45 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of sapo 34 and the highest performing cspms cs40 ls40 and cls2 are presented in fig s4 the sapo 34 powder exhibited a type i isotherm with a negligible hysteresis loop indicative of exclusive microporous nature 39 the isotherms of the cspms were similar yet the adsorption capacity was lower confirming the presence of the salt crystals within the pores reducing available surface area table 2 lists the textural properties of the sorbents the pore size of the cspms sorbents increased compared to sapo 34 whereas the specific surface area and pore volume decreased confirming that impregnating hygroscopic salts cause partial blocking of pores 2 tga analysis was performed for mono salt impregnated cspms to evaluate the thermal stability and dehydration of the parent porous matrix and the developed cspms the results of the sapo 34 and its composites are presented in fig 3 for sapo 34 there was no noticeable weight drop up to 100 c the first weight loss was observed in the temperature range of 110 190 c which may be attributed to the removal of adsorbed water and molecules trapped in the inner cages of the zeolite structure 36 47 significant weight drops were recorded for the composites including in the region of up to 100 c which indicates that a significant amount of water is withheld within the salt in sapo 34 hybrid structures as shown in fig 3 c the weight drops with the increase in the salt content thus the amount of trapped water increases with the salt content this behavior can be explained by the high affinity of the impregnated hygroscopic salts to interact with water via various hydration steps thus dehydration occurs via multi steps including the first dehydration phase of cacl2 6 h2o to cacl2 4 h2o to dehydration to the anhydrate the same trend is shown in samples impregnated with licl 48 3 2 water capture performance the water adsorption isotherms of sapo 34 and its cspms at 25 c are shown in fig 4 the isotherm of the pure sapo 34 indicates a single adsorption step at the low relative pressure range type i isotherm which is a characteristic behavior of microporous solids indicating strong interaction potential between the water molecules and the micropore walls beyond this pressure range no additional water can be adsorbed across the bare sapo 34 due to the saturation of the available adsorption sites 49 while cspms samples follow type ii isotherm due to the effect of salt hydration that results in enhancing water uptake at higher p po 50 in the presence of salts however the adsorption capacity of the materials increases significantly through the hydration of the licl and cacl2 salts within the pores the hybrid sorbents undergo multi event processes involving chemisorption deliquescence and solution absorption at various partial water pressures the distinguishable steps can be evidenced by the respective inflection points in the isotherms of water sorption water clusters form initially near to the wall of pores and around the salt hydrates up to a point where liquid absorption begins and continues by increasing pressure a strong interaction between salts and water vapor leads to an increase in water sorption and possible decantation of salt solution from the pores 2 3 22 for cspms with low salt content and at low relative humidity the isotherm behavior of pure sapo 34 still relatively dominates their sorption behavior however the salt hydration effect dominates with raising its weight concentration cspms with higher salt content led to a higher hydration effect which impeded the isotherm of the hosting sapo 34 although the cs50 and ls50 samples show the highest water sorption capacities among the single salt samples we did not use this concentration in preparing the binary salt ones instead solutions with total salt concentration of 40 wt were used for impregnating the binary samples based on the xrd analysis fig 2 a and b which indicated that among the samples prepared the maximum solution concentration that yields solely the sapo 34 peaks without peaks attributed to salts that would indicate their bulk clustering outside the alpo pores is 40 wt the samples impregnated with salt solutions of higher concentration 50 wt contain bulk salt particles located outside the pores that would lead to unwanted deliquescent behavior and recyclability issues as a result the 40 salt solution concentration was chosen as the total salt concentration for preparing the binary salt samples in the latter different relative weight ratios of the two salts were used fig 4 c shows the complete cycle adsorption desorption isotherms of the binary salt impregnated cspm prepared using a cacl2 to licl relative weight ratio of 2 8 cls2 in comparison to the respective mono salt samples cs40 ls40 of same total salt concentration 40 wt as seen the binary system outperforms the two single salt ones confirming the synergetic action of the two salts combined within the pores toward enhancing the water sorption since the physical and chemical characteristics of cspms were indeed improved by adding the second salt to the impregnation solution the binary salt system experienced changes in its sorption equilibrium compared to the mono salt composites due to a solid salt solution forming inside the pores and as a result the equilibrium of the solvation was affected by the formation of the homogeneous solid solution 22 27 a comparison of the water sorption performance among the binary salt samples impregnated using different cacl2 to licl relative weight ratios is shown in fig s5 it can be observed that the water uptake of binary samples impregnated with solutions with higher licl cacl2 concentration ratio 9 1 8 2 and 7 3 is higher than that of the pure licl impregnated salt sample at a higher rh the highest increase in uptake is observed for the cls2 sample with 8licl 2cacl2 ratio indeed capacities start decreasing compared to the mono salt licl sample with decreasing licl content starting from a licl cacl2 relative ratio of 6 4 and keep declining with lower licl cacl2 relative ratios however the capacities are still higher compared to the mono salt cacl2 sample the observed trend and the location of the maximum water uptake is further shown by the comparison histogram of fig 4 d which displays the equilibrium sorption capacities of the binary salt cspms at 25 c and 90 rh adding cacl2 together with licl enhances the water uptake up to 0 88 g g for sample cls2 with a licl cacl2 ratio of 8 2 indeed this water uptake is four times higher than that of the untreated sapo 34 at 90 rh owing to the optimum synergy between the two slats in the pores and the possible formation of solid salt solution further decrease in licl content reduces the capacity due to the dominant role of the less sorbing cacl2 salt to better understand the water adsorption mechanism of our new materials the experimental data of sapo 34 and the best performing mono and binary cspms cs40 ls40 and cls2 were next fitted to the langmuir isotherm model fig 5 the langmuir model fits well the pure sapo 34 isotherm experimental data suggesting that adsorption in sapo 34 occurs on equivalent adsorption sites forming a monolayer as expected due to the isotherm shape the langmuir model doesn t fit the experimental data for cs40 ls40 and cls2 the mechanism occurring with these materials is unequal to the one observed for sapo 34 other models such as sips freundlich and frenkel halsey hill were used to fit the experimental data fig s6 and table s2 leading to poor fittings sapo 34 isotherm follows a type i shape concordant with the good langmuir fitting supporting the conclusion that there is no multilayer adsorption for the other materials type ii isotherms are observed with an inflection point showing the occurrence of multi step sorption and interactions due to the domination of salt hydration at higher vapor pressures the inflection point is often accepted as the point at which the parent sapo 34 behavior mono layer formation less significative and multi events related to salts start for instance cs40 isotherm shape reveals a first distinguishable step in which it behaves similar to the parent sapo 34 in pure phase followed by multi events and chemo physio interactions with a different shape dominated by the hydration of salt in the inner pores leading to the formation of multilayers and capillary condensation similar behavior is observed in the ls40 isotherm nevertheless the dominancy of the sapo 34 adsorption mechanism is less significative fig 5 c suggesting that the presence of lithium salt does not need such a complete monolayer formation to induce the salt uptake capacity this is further confirmed by the cls2 isotherm shape where the presence of the first step is almost neglected fig 5 d the water is adsorbed through the materials and salts almost immediately 3 3 water vapor sorption kinetics to compare the materials and their uptake capability we performed kinetics studies investigating the water vapor adsorption kinetics of the cspms at p pₒ of 0 8 at 25 c fig 6 a the experimental data were treated using describes the linear driving force ldf model first order kinetics model and the pseudo second order pso model according to ldf the driving force behind adsorption is the difference in concentration between the adsorbed phases and bulk external intraparticle and intramicropore resistances to mass transport are all grouped together as a single diffusional barrier 51 52 1 qt q 1 exp keff t where t water adsorption time min keff mass transfer coefficient 1 min 1 qt water vapor adsorption at time t and q maximum water vapor adsorption capacity the pso model assumes that surface interactions mainly control the entire adsorption process it is also based on the assumption that the adsorption rate is related to the square of the number of available adsorption sites and it is described by eq 2 2 qt q 2 kpt 1 q kpt where t water adsorption time min kp adsorption rate constant l mol 1 min 1 qt water vapor adsorption at time t and q maximum water vapor adsorption capacity ldf and pso fitting showed good concordance with the experimental data fig 7 the residuals obtained for the models were compared fig s7 and the pso model led to better results the mechanism seems to be dominated by surface interactions which are concordant with the equilibrium studies water uptake is primarily dominated by the water interaction with the starting material sapo 34 the water uptake of cspms increases significantly faster in the early sorption period due to hydration and chemisorption due to the presence of the salt particles and the high relative humidity applied however the sapo 34 reached its equilibrium capacity value faster than the salt impregnated samples owing to the salt content in the pores of the latter samples which caused diffusion hindrance thus requiring a prolonged time to reach equilibrium furthermore the sorption in the impregnated salt samples occurs through both physisorption and chemisorption increasing the time to achieve sorption equilibrium finally limited dissipation of the generated heat of sorption due to the loading of the pores with salt is anticipated to affect the sorption kinetics the kinetic parameters obtained by the fittings are shown in table 3 sapo 34 had a higher k value than the samples impregnated with salt confirming that the adsorption rate in pure sapo 34 is higher than in the impregnated samples 53 54 the maximum water vapor adsorption capacity q increased with the impregnation of the salt s inner pores of the materials lithium impregnation showed a more significant improvement in the maximum water adsorption capacity three times higher than sapo 34 the introduction of the two salts lithium and calcium have a synergic effect on the water adsorption capacity increasing q value around 4 times to benchmark our work table 4 summarizes some cspms that have been recently developed for atmospheric water sorption applications all the values of water uptakes used for the purpose of comparison are obtained from the experimental results of the related work for instance silica gel impregnated with cacl2 and licl was found to exhibit enhanced water adsorption with a capacity value of 0 67 gw g and 0 7 gw g respectively table 4 entry 4 and 3 compared to pure silica 0 4 gw g 55 in addition the water uptake was found to be improved for many adsorbents such as mofs and hollow carbon with the loading of the impregnated salts specifically cacl2 and licl to reach a water uptake of 1 gw g table 4 entries 1 and 2 the resulting cspms outperformed adsorbents such as fam z01 fam z02 silica gel and certain mofs 56 compared to known cspms the binary cls2 sapo 34 cacl2 licl developed in this work exhibits a significant sorption capacity and the impregnation of binary salts inside the sapo 34 host shows a significant enhancement in the water uptake which was four times higher than that of the parent sapo 34 additionally salt impregnation aimed to stabilize and prevent the swelling of the impregnated hygroscopic salts taking advantage of the fact that the crystalline rigid and ordered structure of sapo 34 can limit the amount of salt that may leak out of its pores in addition the produced cls2 showed a moderate regeneration temperature 100 c in contrast to many other reported cspms exhibiting higher regeneration temperatures furthermore the developed cspms can work efficiently in moderate and very low relative humidities for instance the optimized sample cls2 can uptake 0 2 g g at 10 rh and 0 32 g g at 20 rh while the other mono and binary impregnated samples that were developed showed enhanced water uptake at rhs higher than 10 compared to pure sapo 34 as well as many conventional adsorbents the performance of the optimized sample cls2 under various climatic conditions is shown in fig s8 the graph presents the anticipated water uptakes gw gcls2 in various geographical regions demonstrating that the developed cspm can be effectively used for awh even in dry climates the material can collect up to 0 88 kg of water per kg of cls2 in areas with high humidity and 0 27 0 49 kg of water per kg of cls2 in the driest places 17 33 rh on earth 3 4 recyclability evaluation to finalize our study the cyclability of the prepared cspms was tested the best performing binary sample cls2 and the two respective mono salt ones cs40 and ls40 underwent 12 continuous sorption desorption cycles to investigate the cyclic stability regeneration was done at 100 c under vacuum for 8 h evidently the cls2 sample showed high stability as after the 12 cycles the water uptake was reduced by only 2 3 fig 6 b and c in comparison the cs40 and ls40 mono salt samples exhibited a capacity decline of 5 7 and 2 86 respectively which can be attributed to the leaching of salt from the sapo 34 pores particularly cacl2 as well as pore blockage due to the leached out cacl2 this minor reduction in the sorption capacity upon cyclic adsorption desorption confirms the stability of the binary salt impregnated systems it has been demonstrated from results that combining two salts can help improve the sorption behavior compared to the mono impregnated samples and reduced the swelling and deliquescence of salts out of pores 27 28 also the concentration of impregnated salts inside the pores plays a crucial role in avoiding the presence of salt hydrates outside the sapo 34 crystals since impregnating the hosting matrix with excessive salt solutions 40 wt may lead to accumulating salt particles outside the pores promoting the unwanted deliquescence however the salts leakage cannot be entirely prevented and further action will be needed to improve the stability of impregnated salts inside the pores such as binding them to the pore walls furthermore employing modelling to predict when the porous matrix needs to be recharged with salts after a specific number of cycles to put back its original water uptake in addition to determine if the utilized sample s chemical and textural characteristics were altered as a result of the water sorption and desorption studies the samples were tested by bet ftir and xrd fig s9 these experiments demonstrated that their textural and chemical characteristics did change noticeably upon repeated exposure to water 4 conclusions novel porous matrix based composite materials for water sorption were developed by impregnating mono and binary salts in different concentrations and relative weight ratios in sapo 34 porous matrix the composition structure thermal and textural properties of the resulting composites were evaluated and the water sorption performance and cyclability were assessed licl and cacl2 salts were impregnated in the sapo 34 matrix and the resulting cspms exhibited enhanced sorption capacity compared to the pure sapo 34 while the mono licl impregnated materials exhibited higher capacity than the cacl2 ones it was also found that cacl2 leaches from the sapo 34 matrix more readily than licl binary salt systems were also prepared where both salts at various ratios were introduced into the host porous matrix these systems were optimized and exhibited significantly higher water uptake than the mono salt ones of the same total salt concentration due to the synergetic action of the two salts inside the same pores which enhanced water affinity and increased the density of the available sorption sites indeed the cls2 binary material prepared using a cacl2 licl mass ratio of 2 and a 40 wt total salt concentration in the impregnating solution exhibited the highest adsorption capacity of 0 88 gw gads at 25 c and 90 rh the cyclability adsorption desorption tests for the same sample revealed that the material after 12 cycles retained 97 7 of its starting capacity based on performance and stability the developed binary salt porous systems are promising for water sorption applications including atmospheric water generation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that
