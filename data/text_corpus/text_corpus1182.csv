5910,high frequency water quality measurements at daily resolutions combined with tracing of nitrate δ15n and δ18o isotopes was proposed as a method to quantify nitrogen n export from point and nonpoint sources which is usually difficult to achieve at a watershed scale the method was applied to two agricultural watersheds located in two nearby plains along the xifeihe and nihe rivers in china the two watersheds had different crops and planting patterns in addition to their different urbanization percentages of 25 3 and 14 1 respectively analysis showed that these two watersheds exported approximately 7 8 and 11 2 kg n ha 1y 1 to their receiving rivers isotope analysis identified that point sources of sewage manure contributed majority 53 of nitrate load to the xifeihe river whereas nonpoint sources from soils fertilizer and atmospheric deposition contributed majority 60 of nitrate load to the nihe river crop patterns reduced the n export through soybean planting or denitrification in rice paddies despite 200 300 kg n ha 1 fertilizer application to the fields per year annual nitrate export patterns of the two watersheds did not show correlations with their corresponding daily flow rates which had important implications to watershed monitoring design nitrogen n concentrations were neither chemeostatic nor discharge correlated except for during high flows in the soybean wheat agriculture dominant xifeihe watershed this indicated that the traditional monitoring protocol for pollution source identification with measurements only conducted during few rainfall events was likely to be insufficient to estimate the total loads of nutrients e g n from watersheds keywords agricultural watersheds crop patterns dual nitrate isotope nitrogen nonpoint source pollution 1 introduction to meet the worldwide growing food demand crop yields have been increased by the use of fertilizers whose excess of nitrogen n concentrations eventually drain to water bodies with potentially detrimental consequences on aquatic ecosystems vitousek et al 1997 elser and bennett 2011 accurate estimations of n load and export are key information for developing effective guidelines for n management n load and export distributions have been quantified at various spatial scales including catchment watershed and large basin ranging from tens to ten thousands km2 van drecht et al 2005 shields et al 2008 wang et al 2011 exner kittridge et al 2016 powley et al 2016 lacher et al 2019 adequate estimations of n export from mesoscale watersheds hundreds to thousands km2 with first order tributaries of major rivers whose water quality has major socio economical and political besides environmental implications is important for n management because it can be used to identify the dominant n sources and then guide prioritization of n reduction actions within watersheds nitrogen sources are typically classified as point and nonpoint sources usepa 2003 van drecht et al 2005 ongley et al 2010 shen et al 2012 the former is primarily due to the discharge of sewage effluents or livestock manures the latter comprise all n entering the surface water system in a diffuse manner mainly originating from agricultural fertilizer soil erosion atmospheric deposition ongley et al 2010 van drecht et al 2005 usepa 2003 yang and toor 2016 quantification of nonpoint source loads at the watershed scale is more difficult than those of point sources because nonpoint n export is affected by many factors stemming from land use types local hydrologic regime e g intensity and frequency of rainfall and both terrestrial and aquatic n transformation processes shields et al 2008 kaushal et al 2011 the identification of n sources becomes particularly challenging in watersheds with mixed land use where point source and nonpoint sources are highly complex kaushal et al 2011 yi et al 2017 many different methods have been developed to estimate nonpoint source n pollution from simple empirical equations to detailed watershed water quality modeling usepa 2003 shen et al 2012 lian et al 2018 the accuracy of these methods depends on meeting several basic conditions including accurate identification of the different sources of the primary n transformation processes and of all n discharge patterns all these conditions depend on watershed characteristics such as topography climate land use and soil types the traditional method for nonpoint source estimation is to characterize the export patterns based on rainfall events however this approach does not identify the relative importance of the two kinds of sources contributing to water pollution kaushal et al 2011 particularly when the point source pollutants were loaded with diffuse manner e g overflow sewage or livestock poultry manures during the storm flow furthermore its applicability and accuracy is greatly limited due to monitoring costs typically resulting in insufficient data to establish relationships between ambient nutrients loads and watershed characteristics yang and jin 2010 to overcome these limitations the isotopic based technique of measuring the two stable isotopes of δ15n and δ18o in nitrates provides an effective option to identify nitrate sources and potential n transformations from wastewater manure fertilizer soils and atmospheric deposition the technique can be applied in different regions with a variety of watershed features and human activities mengis et al 2001 xue et al 2009 ohte 2013 divers et al 2014 yu et al 2016 thus combining n loads monitoring with the measurement of dual nitrate isotopes could be a useful approach for elucidating the relative importance of point and nonpoint sources in contributing to stream n loads in natural and human impacted watersheds kaushal et al 2011 lohse et al 2013 sebestyen et al 2014 yang and toor 2016 hu et al 2019 plains are widely distributed in the middle downstream portions of rivers and are typically characterized by developed industries and agricultures as well as high population densities nonpoint source n load is thought to contribute in equal or greater proportion to point sources in plain areas because n fertilizer application on agricultural land is quite large yang and toor 2016 yi et al 2017 however current estimates of n export in plain areas contain large uncertainties due to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in land use crop patterns and local water flow regimes thus more in depth investigation is necessary for accurately identifying n sources and export patterns linked to human activities and watersheds features this study presented a method combing high frequency monitoring on n export and nitrate dual isotopes analysis to address the current knowledge gap the high frequency monitoring could provide detailed information on n discharge patterns related to watershed hydrology seasonality and human activities within a whole year on the basis of the obtained n discharge patterns nitrate dual isotopes analysis could further identify main n sources and their relative importance as well as n transformation processes the study could provide guidelines on n load monitoring which should be designed according to hydrological regimes instead of targeting few rainfall events in mesoscale watersheds moreover this research compared the n exports through runoff between two watersheds with different crop rotations which demonstrated how cropping pattern affected n export to receiving waters by reducing n fertilizer or improving n use efficiency 2 study sites and methods 2 1 description of study area and sampling sites the study area fig 1 is located in the middle downstream plains region of the huaihe river watershed one of the seven largest watersheds in china the region is in the typical humid to semi humid climate transition zone with a distinct seasonality and has developed agriculture the annual average temperature is 15 c with the warmest part of summer over 22 c occurring from june to august and the coldest part of winter below 10 c from december to february spring and autumn from march to may and from september to november respectively have moderate temperatures 10 22 c the annual average precipitation is 937 mm and the rainy season generally runs from march to september with the main high flow season occurring from june to september we selected the xifeihe river and nihe river watersheds in the region as study sites because of their different land use and land cover and crop planting patterns the xifeihe river watershed has an area of 1841 4 km2 with 68 4 of arable land 25 3 of urbanized land and 6 1 covered by water the nihe river watershed has an area of 634 5 km2 consisting of 76 4 arable land 14 1 urbanized land and 9 2 covered by water table 1 the elevation of the nihe river watershed is 12 m in average greatly lower than the 19 m of the xifeihe river watershed these two watersheds are affected by human activities through intensive agriculture populated villages country towns and an underground coal mining industry crop planting patterns in the xifeihe river watershed are dominated by crop rotation of soybean and wheat while the dominant pattern in the nihe river watershed is a rotation of rice and wheat the ammonia based composite fertilizer containing 150 200 kg n ha 1 was usually applied as base fertilizer in october and urea was applied for topdressing in the next march during wheat growing season with similar applying ways in the two watersheds urea was applied one or two times during the soybean season in the xifeihe river watershed with a fertilizer load of 50 kg n ha 1 in average composite fertilizer was usually applied as base fertilizer in may and urea was subsequently applied for topdressing twice or three times from june to july during the rice growing season in the nihe river watershed with a fertilizer load of 50 100 kg n ha 1 both rivers discharge into the huaihe river through water gates which serve as controls for flooding agricultural irrigation and other ecological functions at their confluences and regulate the water surface elevations and hydraulics of the two rivers in a certain degree when the upper sluice water surface elevations at the gates in the two branches is lower than the down sluice water surface elevation of the huaihe river the gate is closed to prevent backward flow during the high flow season effectively stopping discharge the water level of the huaihe river is also controlled by a water gate near bengbu city downstream of the study area 2 2 monitoring campaign for hydrology and water quality daily averaged meteorological and hydrologic data were collected from automatic weather and gauging stations installed by the huaihe river commission of the ministry of water resources p r c fig 1 a campaign of high frequency water quality measurements was conducted over a full year from july 2017 to july 2018 at each sampling site fig 1 red dot surface water samples were collected at each site at daily or two day intervals during the storm runoff period with rainfall precipitation larger than 10 mm in addition to three regular water samples collected each month during base flow periods this led to a total of 162 different samples measured for the entire study raw water samples and preliminarily filtered water samples were frozen and stored in refrigerators at a temperature of below 20 c in the field stations and then transported to the lab at regular intervals for analysis of water quality and nitrate dual isotopes 2 3 water quality and stable isotope analysis methods water quality analysis included total nitrogen tn and the dissolved inorganic nitrogen species of nitrate nitrite and ammonium the tn analyses were conducted on raw water samples using a uv colorimetric method after alkaline persulfate digestion to measure the soluble forms of inorganic nitrogen nitrite levels were determined using diazotization with sulfanilamide dihydrochloride and the nitrate and ammonium were analyzed by ion chromatography ics 2000 dionex company usa the obtained high frequency monitoring data of water quality were first analyzed which provided guideline on selection of sub samples according to the nitrate concentration profile in the pollutograph for the analysis of nitrate isotopes the sub samples used for analysis of nitrate dual isotopes δ15n and δ18o were partially taken from the same water samples as that for water quality analysis this generally included three samples located in the rising peak and ebb periods of the storm flow the stream water samples collected for stable isotopic analysis were further filtered with 0 2 μm filters and frozen below 20 c until analysis the samples for measuring the isotopic compositions of oxygen δ18o h2o and deuterium δd h2o in river water were selected regularly every two months at each site the isotopes were analyzed by the environmental stable isotope lab in the chinese academy of agricultural sciences caas beijing a denitrifer method was used for analyzing δ15n and δ18o in the nitrates briefly denitrifying bacteria converted the nitrate and nitrite to a gaseous nitrous oxide n2o which was detected using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v plus finnigan germany isotopic ratio values were reported in parts per thousand relative to atmospheric n2 and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow for δ15n and δ18o respectively using the equation 1 δ sample r sample r standard r standard 1000 where δsample is the stable isotope ratio in the river water sample r sample is the ratio of 15n 14n or 18o 16o in the sample and r standard is the ratio of 15n 14n or 18o 16o in the standard the δ15n were calibrated with the standards of usgs32 180 0 1 0 for δ15n usgs34 1 8 0 2 for δ15n and iaea n3 4 7 0 2 for δ15n the δ18o were calibrated with the standards of usgs34 27 8 0 4 for δ18o usgs35 56 8 0 3 for δ18o and iaea n3 25 6 0 4 for δ18o in addition the δ18o of the river water were analyzed to determine whether in situ nitrification was associated with ambient water lohse et al 2013 and the samples of river water for δ18o and δd isotopes were analyzed with laser absorption spectroscopy picarrol1115 i usa for this study δd and δ18o water isotope measurements had a precision of 0 5 and 0 1 respectively using vsmow as a reference standard 2 4 estimates of different source contributions the contributions of different sources were estimated for the two rivers using the mixing model with the δ15n and δ18o as the end members for different sources the typical signatures of δ15n nitrate ranges from 6 to 6 from 0 to 8 and from 4 to 25 for ammonium in fertilizer and rain in soil organic nitrogen and in sewage manure respectively xue et al 2009 kaushal et al 2011 as an additional marker the δ18o nitrate has a positive effect for identification of nitrate precipitation or synthetic nitrate fertilizer from other sources xue et al 2009 yi et al 2017 the end members for different sources in this study were selected by referring to the data obtained in the local or adjacent areas table 2 the end members of δ15n nitrate for sewage manure sources and atmospheric deposited sources were obtained from a research conducted in an adjacent watershed of the xifeihe river watershed ma et al 2019 the end members of δ15n nitrate from soil organic n and ammonium n fertilizer were cited from another research conducted in a watershed with similar geographic climate zhang et al 2018 the end member of δ18o nitrate sourced form soils fertilizer and sewage manure was designated as the same value all of which experience microbial processes different from δ18o in atmospheric deposited sources in addition we used the δ18o of the river water and atmospheric o2 to predict the δ18o nitrate of the nitrified products based on the theoretical microbial nitrification model kendall 1998 which assumes in situ nitrification using two oxygen atoms from water and one oxygen atom from o2 δ 18 o nitrate 2 3 δ 18 o water 1 3 δ 18 o oxygen 2 we assumed a δ18o oxygen value of 23 5 kroopnick and craig 1972 the mixing model of siar stable isotope analysis in r package which was primarily used to infer the contribution of different food sources of organisms in the food web moore and semmens 2008 was employed for analysis the individual river water samples were treated as organisms and different sources were treated as food sources to determine their proportional contributions divers et al 2014 yi et al 2017 2 5 statistical analysis for each watershed the data of water quality and nitrate dual stable isotopes were separated into two groups based on hydrological seasonality one for dry season from november to the next february and one for rainy season from march to october for each group the ranges means and standard errors were statistically analyzed subsequent comparisons on the mean values of n concentration and nitrate stable isotopic ratios between the two seasons in the two watersheds were conducted to test for significant differences at a confidence level of 95 p 0 05 3 results 3 1 precipitation and hydrological condition the averaged precipitations in the xifeihe river watershed and nihe river watershed from june 2017 to may 2018 respectively were 1355 mm and 1345 mm respectively the rainy season in 2017 ended in october and the rainy season in 2018 started in march fig 2 the discharge at the outlets of the two watersheds mostly followed the precipitation pattern however sometimes it was affected by the regulation of the water gates at the confluences with the huaihe river the no data periods in the hydrographs corresponded to full closure of these gates to prevent backflow when water levels in the huaihe river were higher than that in the tributaries the xifeihe river had an averaged discharge of 29 0 m3 s 1 ranging from 14 7 to 81 6 m3 s 1 this was higher than that of the nihe river which had an average discharge of 15 5 m3 s 1 ranging from 11 6 to 19 6 m3 s 1 based on the one year from 2017 to 2018 data the runoff coefficient of the xifeihe river watershed was 0 30 which was lower than 0 48 of the nihe river watershed 3 2 nitrogen export the averaged concentrations of nitrate n in the xifeihe river were 0 9 mg l 1 and 1 5 mg l 1 in the rainy season and the dry season respectively table 3 the concentration of nitrate n showed a typical pattern of building up in antecedent dry days washing out by first flush of precipitation and being diluted by continuous storm flow in the rainy season fig 3 a peak concentrations of nitrate occurred in march may july september and october during the rainy season the records during strong storm generating stream discharges larger than 30 m3 s 1 in the rainy season were positively correlated to discharges fig 4 a the averaged concentrations of nitrate n in the nihe river were 0 4 mg l 1 and 1 0 mg l 1 in the rainy season and the dry season respectively table 3 peak concentrations of nitrate were in march and july during the rainy season but they did not correlate with discharge as for the xifeihe river due to the regulations by the water gate fig 3b and fig 4b the concentrations of nitrate n in both watersheds were higher in the dry season than that in the rainy season and peaked in the period from november to february which was probably caused by point sources fig 3 the mean concentration of nitrate n in the xifeihe river was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in the niher river the averaged concentrations of tn in the water of the xifeihe river were 1 8 mg l 1 and 2 3 mg l 1 in the rainy season and in the dry season respectively they were slightly higher than those of the nihe river which were 1 5 mg l 1 in the rainy season and 1 9 mg l 1 in the dry season table 3 the tn loads from the xifeihe river and nihe river were 7 8 kg n ha 1y 1 and 11 2 kg n ha 1y 1 respectively nitrate accounted for 60 0 of tn in the xifeihe river but only 37 5 in the nihe river these results suggested that the nihe river watershed discharged more reductive n species e g organic nitrogen ammonium than the xifeihe river where organic nitrogen accounted for 51 2 of tn fig 5 3 3 nitrate δ15n and δ18o isotope analysis the δ15n and δ18o isotope ratios in the nitrates from the two rivers varied quite significantly during the study period table 3 and fig 6 the δ15n nitrate values in the xifeihe river ranged from 0 to 21 6 with means of 10 9 in the rainy season and 14 5 in the dry season whereas the δ15n nitrate values in the nihe river ranged from 4 8 to 16 2 with means of 7 0 in the rainy season and 11 5 in the dry season the high ratios in the xifeihe river appeared in the periods from july to august of 2017 and from march to may of 2018 in the rainy season in dry season the high δ15n nitrate values appeared in the periods in november of 2017 and february of 2018 however there were no similar peak values of δ15n isotopes in the nihe river samples to those found in the xifeihe river samples this could be due to the mixing effects when storm water flows through the downstream lowland marshes or wetlands near the outlet of the watershed fig 1 which reduced the peaks of δ15n isotope the δ15n nitrate ratio in both rivers decreased with the decrease in nitrate concentration because of dilution by storm water at the tail of the hydrograph fig 3 and fig 6 the δ18o nitrate isotope ratio in the water collected from the xifeihe river ranged from 6 5 to 29 1 with an average of 3 4 whereas that from the nihe river ranged from 3 4 to 17 2 with an average of 1 9 only a few high values of δ18o nitrate ratio occurred during storm flows in the rainy season in both rivers fig 7 3 4 proportional contribution of different sources the source plots for the dual isotopic values of δ15n and δ18o in the nitrate showed that the exported nitrate mainly originated by sources of ammonium from fertilizer rain and nitrate from soils as well as sewage manure fig 8 additionally the xifeihe river presented high δ15n ratios and nitrate concentration during both the rainy and dry seasons while the nihe river only exhibited higher δ15n ratios and nitrate concentrations during the dry season fig 9 the relationship between the δ15n nitrate isotope ratio and nitrate concentration of the sampled water showed that higher nitrate concentrations i e over 0 5 mg n l 1 mainly occurred during the dry season with higher δ15n values over 10 this result indicated a higher sewage manure proportion as the discharged nitrogen source the nitrate concentration in the xifeihe river had a larger range than that of the nihe river and the low nitrate concentrations occurred mainly in the rainy season fig 9c the point sources of sewage manure contributed the largest proportion 0 53 in average to the river water of xifeihe river whereas the nonpoint sources viz fertilizer soils and atmospheric deposition together contributed the largest proportion 0 60 in average to the river water of nihe river table 4 the temporal variations of sewage manure proportion in the two rivers corresponded well to the δ15n temporal patterns fig 10 during the rainy season high pollution from sewage manure sources in the xifeihe river was concentrated in june august of 2017 and march may of 2018 with the peak values of proportional contribution ranging from 0 66 to 0 80 and from 0 68 to 0 82 in these two periods respectively during the dry season pollution from sewage manure sourced nitrate was dominant in the nihe river with proportional contribution ranging from 0 47 to 0 60 4 discussion 4 1 the nitrate sources in the two watersheds many studies have shown that the exported n concentration increases and displays higher δ15n ratios in nitrates as the agricultural land urbanization or population density increases at watershed scale ohte 2013 kaushal et al 2011 mueller et al 2016 yi et al 2017 lian et al 2018 liu et al 2018 han et al 2018 the main difference between the two studied watersheds was that the region surrounding the xifeihe river had a higher population density than the region surrounding the nihe river with 25 3 and 14 1 of township area respectively the sewage treatment capacity in these rural township areas is rather limited resulting in a higher proportional contribution of sewage manure sources in the xifeihe river 0 53 in annual average than that in the nihe river 0 40 in annual average table 4 however the tn load in the xifeihe river was 7 8 kg n ha 1y 1 which was lower than that of 11 2 kg n ha 1y 1 in the nihe river one main reason was their different runoff coefficients which were 0 30 in the xifeihe river watershed and 0 48 in the nihe river watershed crop planting patterns could also influence the n export from the watersheds jin et al 2012 kelley et al 2013 yang and toor 2016 zhang et al 2017 li et al 2018 fu et al 2019 the fertilizer is assimilated by plants or immobilized as organic nitrogen in the soil zhang et al 2017 part of the fertilizer is lost through ammonium volatilization resulting in elevated δ15n ratios appearing in the remaining ammonium and its subsequent nitrated products yue et al 2013 this could be another reason that nitrates with higher δ15n ratios substantially appeared in the river water of two watersheds table 3 fig 6 and fig 8 with an average of 7 0 in the nihe river and 10 9 in xifeihe river during the rainy season even though a limited amount of fertilizer was applied to the soybean crops n concentrations with high δ15n values increased in the xifeihe river during the soybean growing period that occurred during the rainy season nitrate increase in this period was verified to be the result of point sources from overflowing sewage or livestock manures in the watershed fig 10 the residential areas of rural township are concentrated along the river as indicated in fig 1 thus sewage manure sources would be easily washed out with runoff during the rainy season particularly the sewage from the township areas of yingshang city in the upstream of xifeihe river could make an important contribution causing serious water pollution in the upstream section of this river except for the untreated sewage of the surrounding suburban areas the upstream of the river receives the secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plant of yingdong district of yingshang city due to a comprehensive mixing effect of point source and nonpoint sources the n export patterns corresponded well to the flow regime showing a large variation of nitrate concentration low n concentration and δ15n ratios occurred at the tails of hydrograph with more proportion of atmospheric deposition sources rainwater and high n concentration and δ15n ratios occurred at the peaks of hydrograph with more proportion of sewage manure fig 3 fig 6 and fig 10 several samples showed high δ18o ratios and low δ15n ratios at very low nitrate concentrations indicating a strong dilution effect caused by storm runoff table 3 during the same period nitrate export to nihe river was dominated by nonpoint sources as identified by the lower proportion of sewage and manure sources than what was found in the nitrate exported into the xifeihe river fig 10 4 2 nitrogen transformation and retention in the two watersheds nitrogen measured in the runoff from rice paddies were mainly in organic form due to the redox conditions caused by soil submergence while upland crops discharged more nitrates due to oxic conditions in the soil wexler et al 2012 li et al 2018 the low and flat terrain of the nihe river watershed makes it suitable for planting rice producing redox conditions not only in soils of rice paddy but also in groundwater with weak n oxidation in nihe river watershed consequently the percentage 60 of nitrate to tn in the water of the xifeihe river was almost as double as that 37 5 of the nihe river the δ18o signature provided further information on the main processes of n transformation occurring in the two watersheds the δ18o ratio in the water of the two rivers ranged from 5 9 to 9 0 theoretically leading to δ18o contents ranging from 1 8 to 3 9 in nitrified products according to the eq 2 the average of δ18o nitrate in the water of the xifeihe river and nihe river were 3 5 and 1 5 respectively approaching to the theoretical range from 1 8 to 3 9 indicating that the exported nitrates were primarily from nitrification in the two watersheds in addition other biological processes in the riverine system such as algae uptake and denitrification usually enriching δ15n and δ18o along the 1 1 and 2 1 linear line respectively granger et al 2004 yue et al 2017 li et al 2019 could also play important roles in nitrogen transformation the marshes lakes and riverine wetlands in the lowland areas amounted to 6 1 and 9 2 of the total area in the xifeihe river watershed and nihe river watershed respectively which could potentially result in nitrate assimilation by algae or denitrification leading to decreased nitrate concentration and elevated isotopic values of δ15n and δ18o in the rainy season the high dual isotopic signatures in nitrate were observed when the nitrate concentration was lower than 0 5 mg l 1 as shown in the fig 8 and fig 9 however such indicator of 1 1 or 2 1 linear line was not observed in large scale watersheds due to a series of influencing factors such as multiple n sources complex transformation processes and seasonally varied mixing yi et al 2017 despite the use of high amount of n fertilizer in agriculture in the watersheds the exported n load through runoff was rather small the exported n load ranged from 7 8 to 11 2 kg ha 1y 1 amounting a small proportion to the n loads of 200 300 kg n ha 1y 1 in the fertilizer application a portion of the n load introduced by fertilizer applications might have been lost through ammonium volatilization and denitrification in addition to assimilation by crops or immobilization by soils liu et al 2016 wang et al 2018 fu et al 2019 ammonium volatilization is thought to be the dominant pathway for reactive n loss during the rice growing season in summer exceeding to the n export from the runoff cai et al 2018 rotation patterns with legumes would lead to decrease in n fertilizer application and improvement in n use efficiency resulting less n export or loss through runoff cai et al 2018 hu et al 2018 hunt et al 2019 however the tn load in the xifeihe river 7 8 kg n ha 1y 1 was lower than that in the nihe river 11 2 kg n ha 1y 1 one reason could consist in the difference in runoff coefficients which was 0 30 for the xifeihe river watershed and 0 48 for the nihe river watershed another reason could be attributed to the less fertilizer application and higher n use efficiency in the rice soybean rotation in the xifeihe river watershed which exported less nitrogen despite of the higher impacts from sewage manure source 4 3 impact of flow regime on nitrogen export due to its mobilization nitrate export from the watershed corresponds to seasonal changes in the flow regime hall et al 2009 yang et al 2013 lohse et al 2013 sebestyen et al 2014 mueller et al 2016 bu et al 2017 the nitrate export typically possesses a feature of building up and washing out christopher et al 2008 keller et al 2008 mueller et al 2016 divers et al 2014 li et al 2018 in both watersheds the first flush effect occurred in march when the rainy season started producing a high nitrate concentration in the runoff the peak nitrate concentrations in the water of xifeihe river occurred in march may july september and october at regular intervals matching the high flows of the rivers fig 3 however the flow regime of the nihe river did not change as significantly as that of the xifeihe river due to the runoff regulation by marshes in the lowland areas and the rice paddy pond systems surrounding the river accordingly the relationship between nitrate export and storm flow in the nihe river is not so clear fig 3b and fig 4b furthermore the dual isotopes of nitrate in the water of the nihe river showed less variation fig 6b and fig 7b during dry season of winter both watersheds were characterized by averagely higher δ15n signature and nitrate concentration with δ15n of 14 5 and nitrate n of 1 5 mg l 1 in the xifiehe river as well as δ15n of 11 5 and nitrate n of 1 0 mg l 1 in the nihe river due to a higher proportion of sewage manure sources to the river water while a weaker ability to retain n at low temperature in the watersheds fig 10 the daily scaled data presented in this study had well revealed the temporal features that were not observed before indicating the importance of temporal resolution in monitoring point and nonpoint pollution sources at mesoscale watersheds from several hundreds to thousands of square kilometers where both hydrological regime and nitrogen export showed changing patterns at monthly intervals round the year instead of changing patterns with rainfall events fig 2 this showed evidence that the traditional monitoring protocols with measurements only conducted for limited rainfall events were most likely insufficient to represent the total loads of nutrients e g n for such mesoscale watersheds in the case of the two studied watersheds there were 35 rainfall events with precipitation over 10 mm during the rainy season discharging nitrate with concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 2 6 mg l 1 in the xifei river and from 0 1 to 1 6 mg l 1 in nihe river table 3 and fig 3 respectively for instance the rainfall events with smaller precipitation in march following the dry season showed higher nitrate concentration than that in the rainy season from may to october fig 2 and fig 3 there were also high variations in nitrate concentrations among the rainfall events in the rainy season the n export was not only dependent on precipitation patterns but also on the pollutant building up and washing out process therefore how to properly conduct water quality monitoring campaigns for a year scale is an important and challenging task future study along this research line should be undertaken to balance the monitoring frequency and sampling cost for mesoscale watersheds aiming to accurately estimate the loads of pollutants 5 conclusions the combination of daily water quality monitoring with δ15n and δ18o isotopic analysis showed the relative importance of point and nonpoint sources in n export at a watershed scale in the agricultural areas of east china this information is key in targeting mitigation activities and efforts to reduce n loads to riverine systems additionally it underscored that monitoring of point and nonpoint sources in mesoscale watersheds should be designed to follow the entire hydrograph instead of the traditional approach based on limited rainfall events because of high variability of n concentrations with same stream discharge results also showed that cropping patterns influenced n export from the watersheds despite of the heavy application of n fertilizers n export was reduced through either soybean planting or denitrification in rice paddies or assimilation in riverine waters credit authorship contribution statement qitao yi investigation writing original draft

5910,high frequency water quality measurements at daily resolutions combined with tracing of nitrate δ15n and δ18o isotopes was proposed as a method to quantify nitrogen n export from point and nonpoint sources which is usually difficult to achieve at a watershed scale the method was applied to two agricultural watersheds located in two nearby plains along the xifeihe and nihe rivers in china the two watersheds had different crops and planting patterns in addition to their different urbanization percentages of 25 3 and 14 1 respectively analysis showed that these two watersheds exported approximately 7 8 and 11 2 kg n ha 1y 1 to their receiving rivers isotope analysis identified that point sources of sewage manure contributed majority 53 of nitrate load to the xifeihe river whereas nonpoint sources from soils fertilizer and atmospheric deposition contributed majority 60 of nitrate load to the nihe river crop patterns reduced the n export through soybean planting or denitrification in rice paddies despite 200 300 kg n ha 1 fertilizer application to the fields per year annual nitrate export patterns of the two watersheds did not show correlations with their corresponding daily flow rates which had important implications to watershed monitoring design nitrogen n concentrations were neither chemeostatic nor discharge correlated except for during high flows in the soybean wheat agriculture dominant xifeihe watershed this indicated that the traditional monitoring protocol for pollution source identification with measurements only conducted during few rainfall events was likely to be insufficient to estimate the total loads of nutrients e g n from watersheds keywords agricultural watersheds crop patterns dual nitrate isotope nitrogen nonpoint source pollution 1 introduction to meet the worldwide growing food demand crop yields have been increased by the use of fertilizers whose excess of nitrogen n concentrations eventually drain to water bodies with potentially detrimental consequences on aquatic ecosystems vitousek et al 1997 elser and bennett 2011 accurate estimations of n load and export are key information for developing effective guidelines for n management n load and export distributions have been quantified at various spatial scales including catchment watershed and large basin ranging from tens to ten thousands km2 van drecht et al 2005 shields et al 2008 wang et al 2011 exner kittridge et al 2016 powley et al 2016 lacher et al 2019 adequate estimations of n export from mesoscale watersheds hundreds to thousands km2 with first order tributaries of major rivers whose water quality has major socio economical and political besides environmental implications is important for n management because it can be used to identify the dominant n sources and then guide prioritization of n reduction actions within watersheds nitrogen sources are typically classified as point and nonpoint sources usepa 2003 van drecht et al 2005 ongley et al 2010 shen et al 2012 the former is primarily due to the discharge of sewage effluents or livestock manures the latter comprise all n entering the surface water system in a diffuse manner mainly originating from agricultural fertilizer soil erosion atmospheric deposition ongley et al 2010 van drecht et al 2005 usepa 2003 yang and toor 2016 quantification of nonpoint source loads at the watershed scale is more difficult than those of point sources because nonpoint n export is affected by many factors stemming from land use types local hydrologic regime e g intensity and frequency of rainfall and both terrestrial and aquatic n transformation processes shields et al 2008 kaushal et al 2011 the identification of n sources becomes particularly challenging in watersheds with mixed land use where point source and nonpoint sources are highly complex kaushal et al 2011 yi et al 2017 many different methods have been developed to estimate nonpoint source n pollution from simple empirical equations to detailed watershed water quality modeling usepa 2003 shen et al 2012 lian et al 2018 the accuracy of these methods depends on meeting several basic conditions including accurate identification of the different sources of the primary n transformation processes and of all n discharge patterns all these conditions depend on watershed characteristics such as topography climate land use and soil types the traditional method for nonpoint source estimation is to characterize the export patterns based on rainfall events however this approach does not identify the relative importance of the two kinds of sources contributing to water pollution kaushal et al 2011 particularly when the point source pollutants were loaded with diffuse manner e g overflow sewage or livestock poultry manures during the storm flow furthermore its applicability and accuracy is greatly limited due to monitoring costs typically resulting in insufficient data to establish relationships between ambient nutrients loads and watershed characteristics yang and jin 2010 to overcome these limitations the isotopic based technique of measuring the two stable isotopes of δ15n and δ18o in nitrates provides an effective option to identify nitrate sources and potential n transformations from wastewater manure fertilizer soils and atmospheric deposition the technique can be applied in different regions with a variety of watershed features and human activities mengis et al 2001 xue et al 2009 ohte 2013 divers et al 2014 yu et al 2016 thus combining n loads monitoring with the measurement of dual nitrate isotopes could be a useful approach for elucidating the relative importance of point and nonpoint sources in contributing to stream n loads in natural and human impacted watersheds kaushal et al 2011 lohse et al 2013 sebestyen et al 2014 yang and toor 2016 hu et al 2019 plains are widely distributed in the middle downstream portions of rivers and are typically characterized by developed industries and agricultures as well as high population densities nonpoint source n load is thought to contribute in equal or greater proportion to point sources in plain areas because n fertilizer application on agricultural land is quite large yang and toor 2016 yi et al 2017 however current estimates of n export in plain areas contain large uncertainties due to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in land use crop patterns and local water flow regimes thus more in depth investigation is necessary for accurately identifying n sources and export patterns linked to human activities and watersheds features this study presented a method combing high frequency monitoring on n export and nitrate dual isotopes analysis to address the current knowledge gap the high frequency monitoring could provide detailed information on n discharge patterns related to watershed hydrology seasonality and human activities within a whole year on the basis of the obtained n discharge patterns nitrate dual isotopes analysis could further identify main n sources and their relative importance as well as n transformation processes the study could provide guidelines on n load monitoring which should be designed according to hydrological regimes instead of targeting few rainfall events in mesoscale watersheds moreover this research compared the n exports through runoff between two watersheds with different crop rotations which demonstrated how cropping pattern affected n export to receiving waters by reducing n fertilizer or improving n use efficiency 2 study sites and methods 2 1 description of study area and sampling sites the study area fig 1 is located in the middle downstream plains region of the huaihe river watershed one of the seven largest watersheds in china the region is in the typical humid to semi humid climate transition zone with a distinct seasonality and has developed agriculture the annual average temperature is 15 c with the warmest part of summer over 22 c occurring from june to august and the coldest part of winter below 10 c from december to february spring and autumn from march to may and from september to november respectively have moderate temperatures 10 22 c the annual average precipitation is 937 mm and the rainy season generally runs from march to september with the main high flow season occurring from june to september we selected the xifeihe river and nihe river watersheds in the region as study sites because of their different land use and land cover and crop planting patterns the xifeihe river watershed has an area of 1841 4 km2 with 68 4 of arable land 25 3 of urbanized land and 6 1 covered by water the nihe river watershed has an area of 634 5 km2 consisting of 76 4 arable land 14 1 urbanized land and 9 2 covered by water table 1 the elevation of the nihe river watershed is 12 m in average greatly lower than the 19 m of the xifeihe river watershed these two watersheds are affected by human activities through intensive agriculture populated villages country towns and an underground coal mining industry crop planting patterns in the xifeihe river watershed are dominated by crop rotation of soybean and wheat while the dominant pattern in the nihe river watershed is a rotation of rice and wheat the ammonia based composite fertilizer containing 150 200 kg n ha 1 was usually applied as base fertilizer in october and urea was applied for topdressing in the next march during wheat growing season with similar applying ways in the two watersheds urea was applied one or two times during the soybean season in the xifeihe river watershed with a fertilizer load of 50 kg n ha 1 in average composite fertilizer was usually applied as base fertilizer in may and urea was subsequently applied for topdressing twice or three times from june to july during the rice growing season in the nihe river watershed with a fertilizer load of 50 100 kg n ha 1 both rivers discharge into the huaihe river through water gates which serve as controls for flooding agricultural irrigation and other ecological functions at their confluences and regulate the water surface elevations and hydraulics of the two rivers in a certain degree when the upper sluice water surface elevations at the gates in the two branches is lower than the down sluice water surface elevation of the huaihe river the gate is closed to prevent backward flow during the high flow season effectively stopping discharge the water level of the huaihe river is also controlled by a water gate near bengbu city downstream of the study area 2 2 monitoring campaign for hydrology and water quality daily averaged meteorological and hydrologic data were collected from automatic weather and gauging stations installed by the huaihe river commission of the ministry of water resources p r c fig 1 a campaign of high frequency water quality measurements was conducted over a full year from july 2017 to july 2018 at each sampling site fig 1 red dot surface water samples were collected at each site at daily or two day intervals during the storm runoff period with rainfall precipitation larger than 10 mm in addition to three regular water samples collected each month during base flow periods this led to a total of 162 different samples measured for the entire study raw water samples and preliminarily filtered water samples were frozen and stored in refrigerators at a temperature of below 20 c in the field stations and then transported to the lab at regular intervals for analysis of water quality and nitrate dual isotopes 2 3 water quality and stable isotope analysis methods water quality analysis included total nitrogen tn and the dissolved inorganic nitrogen species of nitrate nitrite and ammonium the tn analyses were conducted on raw water samples using a uv colorimetric method after alkaline persulfate digestion to measure the soluble forms of inorganic nitrogen nitrite levels were determined using diazotization with sulfanilamide dihydrochloride and the nitrate and ammonium were analyzed by ion chromatography ics 2000 dionex company usa the obtained high frequency monitoring data of water quality were first analyzed which provided guideline on selection of sub samples according to the nitrate concentration profile in the pollutograph for the analysis of nitrate isotopes the sub samples used for analysis of nitrate dual isotopes δ15n and δ18o were partially taken from the same water samples as that for water quality analysis this generally included three samples located in the rising peak and ebb periods of the storm flow the stream water samples collected for stable isotopic analysis were further filtered with 0 2 μm filters and frozen below 20 c until analysis the samples for measuring the isotopic compositions of oxygen δ18o h2o and deuterium δd h2o in river water were selected regularly every two months at each site the isotopes were analyzed by the environmental stable isotope lab in the chinese academy of agricultural sciences caas beijing a denitrifer method was used for analyzing δ15n and δ18o in the nitrates briefly denitrifying bacteria converted the nitrate and nitrite to a gaseous nitrous oxide n2o which was detected using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v plus finnigan germany isotopic ratio values were reported in parts per thousand relative to atmospheric n2 and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow for δ15n and δ18o respectively using the equation 1 δ sample r sample r standard r standard 1000 where δsample is the stable isotope ratio in the river water sample r sample is the ratio of 15n 14n or 18o 16o in the sample and r standard is the ratio of 15n 14n or 18o 16o in the standard the δ15n were calibrated with the standards of usgs32 180 0 1 0 for δ15n usgs34 1 8 0 2 for δ15n and iaea n3 4 7 0 2 for δ15n the δ18o were calibrated with the standards of usgs34 27 8 0 4 for δ18o usgs35 56 8 0 3 for δ18o and iaea n3 25 6 0 4 for δ18o in addition the δ18o of the river water were analyzed to determine whether in situ nitrification was associated with ambient water lohse et al 2013 and the samples of river water for δ18o and δd isotopes were analyzed with laser absorption spectroscopy picarrol1115 i usa for this study δd and δ18o water isotope measurements had a precision of 0 5 and 0 1 respectively using vsmow as a reference standard 2 4 estimates of different source contributions the contributions of different sources were estimated for the two rivers using the mixing model with the δ15n and δ18o as the end members for different sources the typical signatures of δ15n nitrate ranges from 6 to 6 from 0 to 8 and from 4 to 25 for ammonium in fertilizer and rain in soil organic nitrogen and in sewage manure respectively xue et al 2009 kaushal et al 2011 as an additional marker the δ18o nitrate has a positive effect for identification of nitrate precipitation or synthetic nitrate fertilizer from other sources xue et al 2009 yi et al 2017 the end members for different sources in this study were selected by referring to the data obtained in the local or adjacent areas table 2 the end members of δ15n nitrate for sewage manure sources and atmospheric deposited sources were obtained from a research conducted in an adjacent watershed of the xifeihe river watershed ma et al 2019 the end members of δ15n nitrate from soil organic n and ammonium n fertilizer were cited from another research conducted in a watershed with similar geographic climate zhang et al 2018 the end member of δ18o nitrate sourced form soils fertilizer and sewage manure was designated as the same value all of which experience microbial processes different from δ18o in atmospheric deposited sources in addition we used the δ18o of the river water and atmospheric o2 to predict the δ18o nitrate of the nitrified products based on the theoretical microbial nitrification model kendall 1998 which assumes in situ nitrification using two oxygen atoms from water and one oxygen atom from o2 δ 18 o nitrate 2 3 δ 18 o water 1 3 δ 18 o oxygen 2 we assumed a δ18o oxygen value of 23 5 kroopnick and craig 1972 the mixing model of siar stable isotope analysis in r package which was primarily used to infer the contribution of different food sources of organisms in the food web moore and semmens 2008 was employed for analysis the individual river water samples were treated as organisms and different sources were treated as food sources to determine their proportional contributions divers et al 2014 yi et al 2017 2 5 statistical analysis for each watershed the data of water quality and nitrate dual stable isotopes were separated into two groups based on hydrological seasonality one for dry season from november to the next february and one for rainy season from march to october for each group the ranges means and standard errors were statistically analyzed subsequent comparisons on the mean values of n concentration and nitrate stable isotopic ratios between the two seasons in the two watersheds were conducted to test for significant differences at a confidence level of 95 p 0 05 3 results 3 1 precipitation and hydrological condition the averaged precipitations in the xifeihe river watershed and nihe river watershed from june 2017 to may 2018 respectively were 1355 mm and 1345 mm respectively the rainy season in 2017 ended in october and the rainy season in 2018 started in march fig 2 the discharge at the outlets of the two watersheds mostly followed the precipitation pattern however sometimes it was affected by the regulation of the water gates at the confluences with the huaihe river the no data periods in the hydrographs corresponded to full closure of these gates to prevent backflow when water levels in the huaihe river were higher than that in the tributaries the xifeihe river had an averaged discharge of 29 0 m3 s 1 ranging from 14 7 to 81 6 m3 s 1 this was higher than that of the nihe river which had an average discharge of 15 5 m3 s 1 ranging from 11 6 to 19 6 m3 s 1 based on the one year from 2017 to 2018 data the runoff coefficient of the xifeihe river watershed was 0 30 which was lower than 0 48 of the nihe river watershed 3 2 nitrogen export the averaged concentrations of nitrate n in the xifeihe river were 0 9 mg l 1 and 1 5 mg l 1 in the rainy season and the dry season respectively table 3 the concentration of nitrate n showed a typical pattern of building up in antecedent dry days washing out by first flush of precipitation and being diluted by continuous storm flow in the rainy season fig 3 a peak concentrations of nitrate occurred in march may july september and october during the rainy season the records during strong storm generating stream discharges larger than 30 m3 s 1 in the rainy season were positively correlated to discharges fig 4 a the averaged concentrations of nitrate n in the nihe river were 0 4 mg l 1 and 1 0 mg l 1 in the rainy season and the dry season respectively table 3 peak concentrations of nitrate were in march and july during the rainy season but they did not correlate with discharge as for the xifeihe river due to the regulations by the water gate fig 3b and fig 4b the concentrations of nitrate n in both watersheds were higher in the dry season than that in the rainy season and peaked in the period from november to february which was probably caused by point sources fig 3 the mean concentration of nitrate n in the xifeihe river was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in the niher river the averaged concentrations of tn in the water of the xifeihe river were 1 8 mg l 1 and 2 3 mg l 1 in the rainy season and in the dry season respectively they were slightly higher than those of the nihe river which were 1 5 mg l 1 in the rainy season and 1 9 mg l 1 in the dry season table 3 the tn loads from the xifeihe river and nihe river were 7 8 kg n ha 1y 1 and 11 2 kg n ha 1y 1 respectively nitrate accounted for 60 0 of tn in the xifeihe river but only 37 5 in the nihe river these results suggested that the nihe river watershed discharged more reductive n species e g organic nitrogen ammonium than the xifeihe river where organic nitrogen accounted for 51 2 of tn fig 5 3 3 nitrate δ15n and δ18o isotope analysis the δ15n and δ18o isotope ratios in the nitrates from the two rivers varied quite significantly during the study period table 3 and fig 6 the δ15n nitrate values in the xifeihe river ranged from 0 to 21 6 with means of 10 9 in the rainy season and 14 5 in the dry season whereas the δ15n nitrate values in the nihe river ranged from 4 8 to 16 2 with means of 7 0 in the rainy season and 11 5 in the dry season the high ratios in the xifeihe river appeared in the periods from july to august of 2017 and from march to may of 2018 in the rainy season in dry season the high δ15n nitrate values appeared in the periods in november of 2017 and february of 2018 however there were no similar peak values of δ15n isotopes in the nihe river samples to those found in the xifeihe river samples this could be due to the mixing effects when storm water flows through the downstream lowland marshes or wetlands near the outlet of the watershed fig 1 which reduced the peaks of δ15n isotope the δ15n nitrate ratio in both rivers decreased with the decrease in nitrate concentration because of dilution by storm water at the tail of the hydrograph fig 3 and fig 6 the δ18o nitrate isotope ratio in the water collected from the xifeihe river ranged from 6 5 to 29 1 with an average of 3 4 whereas that from the nihe river ranged from 3 4 to 17 2 with an average of 1 9 only a few high values of δ18o nitrate ratio occurred during storm flows in the rainy season in both rivers fig 7 3 4 proportional contribution of different sources the source plots for the dual isotopic values of δ15n and δ18o in the nitrate showed that the exported nitrate mainly originated by sources of ammonium from fertilizer rain and nitrate from soils as well as sewage manure fig 8 additionally the xifeihe river presented high δ15n ratios and nitrate concentration during both the rainy and dry seasons while the nihe river only exhibited higher δ15n ratios and nitrate concentrations during the dry season fig 9 the relationship between the δ15n nitrate isotope ratio and nitrate concentration of the sampled water showed that higher nitrate concentrations i e over 0 5 mg n l 1 mainly occurred during the dry season with higher δ15n values over 10 this result indicated a higher sewage manure proportion as the discharged nitrogen source the nitrate concentration in the xifeihe river had a larger range than that of the nihe river and the low nitrate concentrations occurred mainly in the rainy season fig 9c the point sources of sewage manure contributed the largest proportion 0 53 in average to the river water of xifeihe river whereas the nonpoint sources viz fertilizer soils and atmospheric deposition together contributed the largest proportion 0 60 in average to the river water of nihe river table 4 the temporal variations of sewage manure proportion in the two rivers corresponded well to the δ15n temporal patterns fig 10 during the rainy season high pollution from sewage manure sources in the xifeihe river was concentrated in june august of 2017 and march may of 2018 with the peak values of proportional contribution ranging from 0 66 to 0 80 and from 0 68 to 0 82 in these two periods respectively during the dry season pollution from sewage manure sourced nitrate was dominant in the nihe river with proportional contribution ranging from 0 47 to 0 60 4 discussion 4 1 the nitrate sources in the two watersheds many studies have shown that the exported n concentration increases and displays higher δ15n ratios in nitrates as the agricultural land urbanization or population density increases at watershed scale ohte 2013 kaushal et al 2011 mueller et al 2016 yi et al 2017 lian et al 2018 liu et al 2018 han et al 2018 the main difference between the two studied watersheds was that the region surrounding the xifeihe river had a higher population density than the region surrounding the nihe river with 25 3 and 14 1 of township area respectively the sewage treatment capacity in these rural township areas is rather limited resulting in a higher proportional contribution of sewage manure sources in the xifeihe river 0 53 in annual average than that in the nihe river 0 40 in annual average table 4 however the tn load in the xifeihe river was 7 8 kg n ha 1y 1 which was lower than that of 11 2 kg n ha 1y 1 in the nihe river one main reason was their different runoff coefficients which were 0 30 in the xifeihe river watershed and 0 48 in the nihe river watershed crop planting patterns could also influence the n export from the watersheds jin et al 2012 kelley et al 2013 yang and toor 2016 zhang et al 2017 li et al 2018 fu et al 2019 the fertilizer is assimilated by plants or immobilized as organic nitrogen in the soil zhang et al 2017 part of the fertilizer is lost through ammonium volatilization resulting in elevated δ15n ratios appearing in the remaining ammonium and its subsequent nitrated products yue et al 2013 this could be another reason that nitrates with higher δ15n ratios substantially appeared in the river water of two watersheds table 3 fig 6 and fig 8 with an average of 7 0 in the nihe river and 10 9 in xifeihe river during the rainy season even though a limited amount of fertilizer was applied to the soybean crops n concentrations with high δ15n values increased in the xifeihe river during the soybean growing period that occurred during the rainy season nitrate increase in this period was verified to be the result of point sources from overflowing sewage or livestock manures in the watershed fig 10 the residential areas of rural township are concentrated along the river as indicated in fig 1 thus sewage manure sources would be easily washed out with runoff during the rainy season particularly the sewage from the township areas of yingshang city in the upstream of xifeihe river could make an important contribution causing serious water pollution in the upstream section of this river except for the untreated sewage of the surrounding suburban areas the upstream of the river receives the secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plant of yingdong district of yingshang city due to a comprehensive mixing effect of point source and nonpoint sources the n export patterns corresponded well to the flow regime showing a large variation of nitrate concentration low n concentration and δ15n ratios occurred at the tails of hydrograph with more proportion of atmospheric deposition sources rainwater and high n concentration and δ15n ratios occurred at the peaks of hydrograph with more proportion of sewage manure fig 3 fig 6 and fig 10 several samples showed high δ18o ratios and low δ15n ratios at very low nitrate concentrations indicating a strong dilution effect caused by storm runoff table 3 during the same period nitrate export to nihe river was dominated by nonpoint sources as identified by the lower proportion of sewage and manure sources than what was found in the nitrate exported into the xifeihe river fig 10 4 2 nitrogen transformation and retention in the two watersheds nitrogen measured in the runoff from rice paddies were mainly in organic form due to the redox conditions caused by soil submergence while upland crops discharged more nitrates due to oxic conditions in the soil wexler et al 2012 li et al 2018 the low and flat terrain of the nihe river watershed makes it suitable for planting rice producing redox conditions not only in soils of rice paddy but also in groundwater with weak n oxidation in nihe river watershed consequently the percentage 60 of nitrate to tn in the water of the xifeihe river was almost as double as that 37 5 of the nihe river the δ18o signature provided further information on the main processes of n transformation occurring in the two watersheds the δ18o ratio in the water of the two rivers ranged from 5 9 to 9 0 theoretically leading to δ18o contents ranging from 1 8 to 3 9 in nitrified products according to the eq 2 the average of δ18o nitrate in the water of the xifeihe river and nihe river were 3 5 and 1 5 respectively approaching to the theoretical range from 1 8 to 3 9 indicating that the exported nitrates were primarily from nitrification in the two watersheds in addition other biological processes in the riverine system such as algae uptake and denitrification usually enriching δ15n and δ18o along the 1 1 and 2 1 linear line respectively granger et al 2004 yue et al 2017 li et al 2019 could also play important roles in nitrogen transformation the marshes lakes and riverine wetlands in the lowland areas amounted to 6 1 and 9 2 of the total area in the xifeihe river watershed and nihe river watershed respectively which could potentially result in nitrate assimilation by algae or denitrification leading to decreased nitrate concentration and elevated isotopic values of δ15n and δ18o in the rainy season the high dual isotopic signatures in nitrate were observed when the nitrate concentration was lower than 0 5 mg l 1 as shown in the fig 8 and fig 9 however such indicator of 1 1 or 2 1 linear line was not observed in large scale watersheds due to a series of influencing factors such as multiple n sources complex transformation processes and seasonally varied mixing yi et al 2017 despite the use of high amount of n fertilizer in agriculture in the watersheds the exported n load through runoff was rather small the exported n load ranged from 7 8 to 11 2 kg ha 1y 1 amounting a small proportion to the n loads of 200 300 kg n ha 1y 1 in the fertilizer application a portion of the n load introduced by fertilizer applications might have been lost through ammonium volatilization and denitrification in addition to assimilation by crops or immobilization by soils liu et al 2016 wang et al 2018 fu et al 2019 ammonium volatilization is thought to be the dominant pathway for reactive n loss during the rice growing season in summer exceeding to the n export from the runoff cai et al 2018 rotation patterns with legumes would lead to decrease in n fertilizer application and improvement in n use efficiency resulting less n export or loss through runoff cai et al 2018 hu et al 2018 hunt et al 2019 however the tn load in the xifeihe river 7 8 kg n ha 1y 1 was lower than that in the nihe river 11 2 kg n ha 1y 1 one reason could consist in the difference in runoff coefficients which was 0 30 for the xifeihe river watershed and 0 48 for the nihe river watershed another reason could be attributed to the less fertilizer application and higher n use efficiency in the rice soybean rotation in the xifeihe river watershed which exported less nitrogen despite of the higher impacts from sewage manure source 4 3 impact of flow regime on nitrogen export due to its mobilization nitrate export from the watershed corresponds to seasonal changes in the flow regime hall et al 2009 yang et al 2013 lohse et al 2013 sebestyen et al 2014 mueller et al 2016 bu et al 2017 the nitrate export typically possesses a feature of building up and washing out christopher et al 2008 keller et al 2008 mueller et al 2016 divers et al 2014 li et al 2018 in both watersheds the first flush effect occurred in march when the rainy season started producing a high nitrate concentration in the runoff the peak nitrate concentrations in the water of xifeihe river occurred in march may july september and october at regular intervals matching the high flows of the rivers fig 3 however the flow regime of the nihe river did not change as significantly as that of the xifeihe river due to the runoff regulation by marshes in the lowland areas and the rice paddy pond systems surrounding the river accordingly the relationship between nitrate export and storm flow in the nihe river is not so clear fig 3b and fig 4b furthermore the dual isotopes of nitrate in the water of the nihe river showed less variation fig 6b and fig 7b during dry season of winter both watersheds were characterized by averagely higher δ15n signature and nitrate concentration with δ15n of 14 5 and nitrate n of 1 5 mg l 1 in the xifiehe river as well as δ15n of 11 5 and nitrate n of 1 0 mg l 1 in the nihe river due to a higher proportion of sewage manure sources to the river water while a weaker ability to retain n at low temperature in the watersheds fig 10 the daily scaled data presented in this study had well revealed the temporal features that were not observed before indicating the importance of temporal resolution in monitoring point and nonpoint pollution sources at mesoscale watersheds from several hundreds to thousands of square kilometers where both hydrological regime and nitrogen export showed changing patterns at monthly intervals round the year instead of changing patterns with rainfall events fig 2 this showed evidence that the traditional monitoring protocols with measurements only conducted for limited rainfall events were most likely insufficient to represent the total loads of nutrients e g n for such mesoscale watersheds in the case of the two studied watersheds there were 35 rainfall events with precipitation over 10 mm during the rainy season discharging nitrate with concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 2 6 mg l 1 in the xifei river and from 0 1 to 1 6 mg l 1 in nihe river table 3 and fig 3 respectively for instance the rainfall events with smaller precipitation in march following the dry season showed higher nitrate concentration than that in the rainy season from may to october fig 2 and fig 3 there were also high variations in nitrate concentrations among the rainfall events in the rainy season the n export was not only dependent on precipitation patterns but also on the pollutant building up and washing out process therefore how to properly conduct water quality monitoring campaigns for a year scale is an important and challenging task future study along this research line should be undertaken to balance the monitoring frequency and sampling cost for mesoscale watersheds aiming to accurately estimate the loads of pollutants 5 conclusions the combination of daily water quality monitoring with δ15n and δ18o isotopic analysis showed the relative importance of point and nonpoint sources in n export at a watershed scale in the agricultural areas of east china this information is key in targeting mitigation activities and efforts to reduce n loads to riverine systems additionally it underscored that monitoring of point and nonpoint sources in mesoscale watersheds should be designed to follow the entire hydrograph instead of the traditional approach based on limited rainfall events because of high variability of n concentrations with same stream discharge results also showed that cropping patterns influenced n export from the watersheds despite of the heavy application of n fertilizers n export was reduced through either soybean planting or denitrification in rice paddies or assimilation in riverine waters credit authorship contribution statement qitao yi investigation writing original draft

using a wavelet decomposition approach coupled with a multivariate autoregressive model the generated annual time series are used to reconstruct daily simulations to embed multiple low frequency oscillations in a daily time series the proposed weather generator is applied to the geum river basin in south korea and its performance is compared to that of a nested simplified model results show that the proposed model performs well with respect to reproducing marginal distributional attributes multisite dependencies and climate variability at the daily and annual scales lastly the weather generator adopts a quantile mapping procedure to incorporate long term distributional changes into generated climate sequences for use in climate change assessments results show that inter annual variability is also well preserved while climate sequences are adjusted by various alterations keywords multivariate and multisite weather generator inter annual variability extreme rainfall events 1 introduction many regions lack climate data necessitating realistic simulations of climate variables breinl et al 2017 a weather generator can produce a large ensemble of time series of climate variables and has proved a useful tool in an abundance of applications such as agricultural and water system management sparks et al 2018 supit et al 2012 analysis of climate change impact forsythe et al 2014 khazaei et al 2012 and assessment of extreme weather risk ehmele and kunz 2019 in particular a weather generator is often required to develop sequences of multiple weather variables at multiple locations while maintaining spatial and temporal dynamics as they are fundamental for impact analyses aghakouchak et al 2011 the focus of this paper is on the stochastic simulation of multi site climate variables which still needs further refinement a number of weather generators have been developed in the last three decades although the approaches differ in complexity they can be categorized based on non parametric apipattanavis et al 2010 king et al 2014 leander and buishand 2009 sharif and burn 2007 semi parametric breinl et al 2013 steinschneider and brown 2013 or parametric approaches e g baigorria and jones 2010 bárdossy and pegram 2009 chen et al 2018 evin et al 2018 pegram and others 2009 verdin et al 2018 non parametric approaches such as a nearest neighbor algorithm e g sharif and burn 2007 and a kernel density estimation method e g harrold et al 2003 have shown improved ability to capture nonlinearities between climate variables also these methods are relatively simple and can reproduce historical observations very well however they lack extrapolation ability which is needed to generate unobserved extremes i e drought or flooding events outside the range of observations one of the motivations for using stochastic weather generators semi parametric approaches that use both parametric and non parametric modules have proven well suited for generating multivariate climate sequences sparks et al 2018 but are not completely immune from the limitations of non parametric approaches parametric approaches often use chain dependent process katz 1977 fixed probability models and time series models although these types are limited in representing complex nonlinear inter variable dependence structure they are often preferred for climate change impact and extreme weather risk analyses due to their extrapolation capability preserving low and high frequencies such as inter annual variability and extreme events are the main issue discussed by many authors chen et al 2019 fatichi et al 2011 kilsby et al 2007 wilks 1999 also it has been noted that underestimation of inter annual variability and extreme precipitation events may represent the most difficult challenge in weather modeling fatichi et al 2011 kyselỳ and dubrovskỳ 2005 wilks and wilby 1999 underestimation of inter annual variability occasionally leads to underrepresentation of extreme events over long time periods sparks et al 2018 indicating that adopting modules to preserve both low and high frequency statistics may be much more important when a weather generator is employed for future climate conditions several studies have attempted to address underestimation by weather generators of low frequency variability however a majority of the studies have not been generalized to multisite applications chen et al 2010 dubrovskỳ et al 2004 fatichi et al 2011 wang and nathan 2007 only a few weather generators have considered low frequency variability in multisite applications steinschneider and brown 2013 proposed a semi parametric multisite weather generator for use in climate change studies they simulated low frequency climate frequency by using a wavelet decomposition coupled to a first order autoregressive ar1 model this weather generator is quite promising in simulating observed precipitation and temperature statistics e g mean standard deviation and multisite dependencies however the model underestimates temperature s inter annual variability also the weather generator has only limited ability to generate weather events outside the range of observations since it is based on a k nearest neighbor resampling technique with observed datasets li and babovic 2019a developed a two stage multivariate multisite weather generator after creating single site weather the model reproduces inter site dependencies and inter annual variability using empirical copulas in the second stage the generator performed reasonably well in reproducing the inter site dependencies and inter annual variability however post processing presents limitations as the rank structures are directly inherited from the historical record the length of the simulated meteorological series should be identical to that of the observation as such long period simulations e g 100 year are not possible the generator also lacks extrapolation ability which is a common problem when the non parametric approach is adopted similar limitations can be found in the model of li et al 2018 chen et al 2019 introduced a multisite weather generator which preserves low frequency climate variability by coupling annual monthly and daily weather generators in order to preserve low frequency variability of the climate variables the daily time series are incrementally adjusted by annual and monthly time series generated by monthly and annual ar1 models respectively although promising the natural correlation between daily precipitation characteristics e g number of wet days and annual monthly precipitation amounts is ignored in the adjustment procedure as a result it is theoretically possible that a large annual monthly precipitation be assigned to a small number of wet days leading to enormous extreme rainfall events similarly exaggeration can occur with correlation between annual monthly temperatures and the number of wet days because of wide use of light tailed distributions such as exponential gamma and weibull distributions weather generators often lead to an underestimation of extreme precipitation events papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 to mitigate this deficiency a non parametric has been employed to avoid specific distributional assumptions e g qian et al 2008 however mehrotra and sharma 2010 reported that the nonparametric approach e g gaussian kernel still suffers from underestimation although it offers the flexibility of precipitation fitting alternatively heavy tailed distributions are used to correct extreme precipitation behavior cavanaugh et al 2015 concluded that heavy tailed distributions are generally in better agreement with observed extremes information about future climate is frequently inferred from general circulation models gcms jiménez cisneros et al 2014 however there are well acknowledged deficiencies in the ability of gcms to represent regional climate fatichi et al 2011 li and babovic 2019b weather generators have provided an efficient complement to general circulation model gcms for investigating local water system performance e g ahn and kim 2019 chen et al 2018 in particular weather generators have been adopted in the bottom up vulnerable assessments to evaluate water system performance under a wide range of future climate scenarios brown and wilby 2012 ghile et al 2014 herman et al 2015 quinn et al 2018 consequently there is a need to develop a weather generator which is able to preserve low and high frequency variabilities when simulating future climate conditions based on the literature this study presents a multivariate and multisite stochastic weather generator which preserves low and high frequency climate variabilities furthermore the model can support analysis of climate change impact by adjusting its parameters which are sensitive to diverse aspects of climate change to account for low and high frequency climate oscillations our proposed model adopts a post processing technique by coupling annual and daily generator models an annual weather generator includes a wavelet decomposition coupled to a multivariate autoregressive model to demonstrate low frequency multivariate oscillations a daily weather generator consists of 1 a recently developed heavy tailed distribution papastathopoulos and tawn 2013 2 a student t copula to account for spatial dependence and 3 a multivariate autoregressive model to consider the effect of precipitation occurrence for temperature simulations lastly our proposed model is finalized with a quantile mapping procedure to demonstrate long term distributional shifts in climate variables under climate change this study evaluates the proposed model in comparison with a relatively parsimonious weather generator to present the impact of the various components e g low frequency oscillation extreme events adopted in the proposed model the structure of this paper is as follows the study area and data are described in section 2 the proposed model is presented in section 3 the model is evaluated with a summary of the results focusing on the reproduction of low and high frequency variabilities in section 4 section 5 illustrates the ability of the model to produce various climate sequences for use under climate change analysis the article then concludes with a discussion in section 6 2 description of study area and data this study focuses on the geum river basin located in the midwest part of south korea fig 1 that drains the geum river estuary into the yellow sea with a length of about 390 km and a drainage area of approximately 15 000 km2 since the basin is located in a transitional zone with different climates dominant climate phenomena in each season are fairly heterogeneous leading to strong seasonality ahn and kim 2019 in addition interannual precipitation is rather variable in the last 40 years average annual precipitation has been 1290 mm high and low of 1783 mm and 754 mm respectively with 106 wet days per year approximately two thirds of annual precipitation is concentrated in the summer high flow season spanning from late june to early september while precipitation in winter represents less than 10 of annual precipitation this particular basin is selected because the geum river has experienced several severe droughts resulting in decreased availability of water resources seo et al 2018 accordingly many studies have conducted climate change assessment of this region e g ahn and kim 2019 kim et al 2019 also the geum river covers an extensive area enabling a thorough evaluation of the proposed model with the weather sites experiencing diverse spatial and temporal relations to achieve the objectives of this study nine weather stations of the korea meteorological administration s automated surface observing system asos are selected fig 1 and daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature are included the data used covers a 45 year period from 1 january 1973 to 31 december 2017 3 methodologies the weather generator considered in this work couples annual and daily weather generators regional annual average precipitation and temperature are generated using a wavelet decomposition kwon et al 2007 and multivariate autoregressive model neumaier and schneider 2001 for simulating multiple low frequency oscillations in climate daily precipitation and temperature are generated using multisite weather generators akin to those in sparks et al 2018 and evin et al 2018 as post processing daily simulations are reconstructed by simulations of annual climate lastly time series of the generated climate variables are altered to enforce distributional shifts by a quantile mapping procedure an overview of the modeling framework is presented in fig 2 the sub models and algorithms used are demonstrated in detail below 3 1 multivariate annual weather generator consider x t s with time t 1 n represents a time series of annual area averaged climate variables s 1 s for a region note that this study considers three variables precipitation x prec and maximum x tmax and minimum temperatures x tmin this times series is decomposed into k orthogonal component series z k t s that represent various low frequency signals and a residual component ε t 1 x t s k 1 k z k t s ε t s a simulation of x t is generated with time series models of each frequency component and the residual noise following kwon et al 2007 the signals are modeled using autoregressive ar models but the residuals are modeled using multivariate ar models to consider inter variable oscillations 2 x t s k 1 k i 1 p k α k i z k t i s v k t i 1 p a i ε t i s ω s t where p k is the order of the ar model for the kth low frequency signals p is the order for the residual noise α k i and a i are the coefficients and coefficient matrices of the ar model and v k t and ω s t are independent identically distributed white noise processes wavelet decomposition is adopted to simulate the low frequency signals and residual noise eq 2 because the wavelet transform permits an orthogonal decomposition of the original time series in both the time and frequency domains it is very attractive in the context of additive decomposition theoretical background of the wavelet transformation can be found in kwon et al 2007 and torrence and compo 1998 also note that the orders p k and p of each ar model can be determined using the well known panelized likelihood function e g akaike information criteria aic akaike 1974 however the study simply uses a first order ar model following kwon et al 2007 3 2 multisite and multivariate daily weather generator this study first generates daily precipitation sequences x t prec as a pivot variable at each site j x j t prec is first modeled using a latent gaussian variable y j t prec 3 x j t prec q prec 1 y j t prec where q is a non decreasing distribution function for daily precipitation sequences the inverse nondecreasing function takes the form below to demonstrate zero values no precipitation days 4 q prec 1 y j t prec f prec 1 φ y j t prec if y j t prec d prec 0 if y j t prec d prec where f is the cumulative distribution function cdf φ is the standard normal cdf and d is the threshold for the gaussian variable below which the outcome is censored similar to baxevani and lennartsson 2015 and sparks et al 2018 a one step process is developed to simultaneously generate precipitation occurrence and amounts in this formulation temporal dependence of y prec is modeled using an ar model in particular a first order ar model is used in this study 5 y j t prec β 0 prec β 1 prec y j t 1 prec t prec where β 0 prec and β 1 prec are the constant and coefficient of the ar model respectively at site j and t prec is residual noise residual noise is often designed to follow a multi normal distribution to preserve spatial dependence however it provides almost zero dependence for the upper tail values as has often been criticized by previous studies e g aghakouchak et al 2010 to circumvent this limitation t prec is modeled by a student t copula to maintain tail dependence of spatial extreme precipitation events also previous studies reported that spatial dependence is not well preserved in the final generated time series keller et al 2015 which we also experienced while developing this model this difficulty arises mainly from a stochastic process that partly destroys the imposed correlation structure to mitigate this problem the correlation matrix of t prec is estimated based on an optimization procedure which in turn is based on a bisection method burden and faires 2011 that minimizes the difference between the generated spatial correlation and the target correlation of observations if the correlation matrix is not positive definite the nearest positive definite matrix is chosen higham 1988 rebonato and jäckel 2011 this optimization procedure is conducted prior to the actual generation simulation and performed for each month to account for the seasonality of the precipitation occurrence at each site j f prec is based on a relatively new distribution the e gpd extended generalized pareto distribution which was first proposed by papastathopoulos and tawn 2013 note that other heavy tailed distributions for daily precipitation amounts mixtures of gamma distribution and gpd proposed by vrac and naveau 2007 are also tested in this study however e gpd is parsimonious and computationally less expensive than the mixtures of gamma distribution and gpd so it is adopted in this study e gpd distribution is given by 6 f prec 1 φ y j t prec g ω ϑ φ y j t prec ζ η where 7 ω ϑ φ 1 1 ϑ φ 1 ϑ if ϑ 0 1 e φ if ϑ 0 where 1 ϑ φ is the function for max 1 ϑ φ 0 η is a scale parameter and g ϑ is equal to ϑ ζ ζ 0 overall three parameters η ζ a n d ϑ are required for each site in this study the tail index parameter ϑ is estimated by a non negative value ϑ 0 as suggested by serinaldi and kilsby 2014 e gpd distribution has an upper bound when ϑ 0 which is not realistic probability weight moments naveau et al 2016 are utilized to determine a parameter set for each site finally similar to precipitation sequences maximum and minimum temperatures x j t tmax and x j t tmin are modeled using latent gaussian variables see eqs 3 and 4 for these variables the thresholds dtmax and dtmin are set to the value of negative infinity implying that they are not lower bounded also temporal dependences of y tmax and y tmin are modeled using an ar model note that a fifth order ar model is utilized with an exogenous variable i e y j t prec which is decided by the panelized likelihood functions i e aic values before running the actual generation simulation 8 y j t max β 0 max τ 1 5 β τ max y j t τ max β 6 max y j t prec t max 9 y j t min β 0 min τ 1 5 β τ min y j t τ min β 6 min y j t prec t min similar to t prec the residual noises t tmax and t tmin are modeled to maintain a tail dependence of spatial extreme events by a student t copula and optimized correlation matrices however for the temperature simulations the optimized correlation matrices are composed of two correlation matrices and the cross correlation matrix between maximum and minimum temperatures c c tmax c tmaxtmin c tmaxtmin c tmin finally the normal distribution is utilized for the cdfs f tmax and f tmin 3 3 coupling annual and daily weather simulations daily weather simulations must be conditioned on annual climate simulations to preserve low frequency variability to accomplish this annual simulation is used to generate new daily simulation data for each simulation year that is comprised of a resampling of the generated daily simulation daily weather simulation is iteratively fit to each annual simulation and rearranged for a given simulation year the procedure is as follows 1 generate a simulation of regional annual climate variables precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures of length nannual using the annual weather generator described in section 3 1 2 generate a simulation of daily climate of length ndaily using the multi site daily weather generator presented in section 3 2 note that ndaily is set to be sufficiently greater than nannual to prevent duplicated simulations in the final data set 3 for a simulation year calculate the euclidean distances for each variable e s x t annual s x s 2 between the annual area averaged x and the vector of annual area averaged x obtained by the daily generator here each variable is scaled i e z score normalization to provide equivalent units for all s before calculating the euclidean distances 4 calculate the smallest distance for overall variable sets and determine the daily climate sequences corresponding to the smallest distance for the simulation year tannual 5 adjust the simulation of daily climate data set generated in step 2 by eliminating the daily climate sequences used in step 4 thus the length of the remaining simulation of daily climate set is ndaily 1 6 repeat steps 3 5 for all simulation years of length nannual the initial generations of annual and daily simulations steps 1 and 2 are from historic data for both a random year and a random day in the simulation starting month respectively also note that a monthly weather generator could additionally be developed to preserve the inter annual variability of the monthly series then daily weather simulation would be iteratively fit to annual and monthly simulations however a monthly weather generator is not considered in this study 3 4 incorporating long term changes into climate simulations the proposed model is not capable of altering the distribution of the variable considered under climate change many potential shifts are possible including changes in the mean and variance or extremes a wide range of changes can enable planners to evaluate how different assumptions of future climate conditions would impact the decision process as shown by brown et al 2011 2012 for example planners can develop system response surfaces that map planning relevant metrics and decision thresholds for those metrics across a wide range of plausible future climates this can help facilitate discussion between planners and help them reach a consensus on a decision to illustrate an example for a wide range of changes this study utilizes changes in the major parameters by incorporating a quantile mapping method into the proposed model to simulate a diverse range of future climate scenarios consider χ j t prec to be daily nonzero precipitation values for site j generated from the weather generator described in section 3 3 to impose new distributional shifts two parameters η ϑ which generate various changes of precipitation patterns in the low and upper parts of the e gpd distribution are utilized see eq 6 let historic and future simulate χ j t prec and χ j t prec simulated with parameter sets η ϑ and η ϑ respectively here the historic parameter set η ϑ can be estimated by fitting the χ j t prec simulation once the new parameters of the designed future conditions are determined a quantile mapping approach is used for the distribution f χ j t prec 10 χ j t prec f χ j t prec 1 f χ j t prec χ j t prec a similar process is undertaken for maximum and minimum temperatures χ j t tmax and χ j t tmin by assuming that historic and future simulated temperatures follow normal distributions once the new parameters of the designed future conditions are identified a quantile mapping approach is applied to the historic simulated temperatures this procedure is repeated for each month and location to account for the seasonality of the generated variables 4 application and performance evaluation to construct the low frequency signals eq 1 for a time series of annual area averaged climate variables wavelet power spectrums and associated global power spectrums are first utilized for observed annual variables fig 3 generally all historical time series exhibit a significant signal in a 4 7 year band a significant signal is modeled by using one low frequency component k 1 for our study basin in the proposed annual weather generator to evaluate the performance of the proposed weather generator m c o u p l i n g reproduction of key multiple properties of each weather variable is analyzed to achieve this the model is run 100 separate times each run being 50 years long referencing the geum river basin in addition this study generates climate scenarios using a relatively simple weather generator m s i m p l e to show the effects of the various components e g adjusted spatial correlations extreme rainfall events annual low frequency oscillation adopted in m c o u p l i n g m s i m p l e uses a latent gaussian variable eq 3 and gamma distribution to determine precipitation occurrence and to simulate precipitation amounts on wet days then m s i m p l e produces maximum and minimum temperature sequences by using a fifth order ar model with an exogenous variable i e zero inflated precipitation which is also comparable to m c o u p l i n g for temperature simulations note that m s i m p l e is different from m c o u p l i n g regarding the modules for 1 preserving annual low frequency variability 2 adopting a heavy tailed distribution for precipitation and 3 modeling spatial dependence using an optimization procedure and a student t copula fig 4 presents observed and simulated daily precipitation statistics for two models m c o u p l i n g and m s i m p l e and all nine gauges over the geum river basin the median values for all statistics are calculated for each month the 45 line indicates perfect model performance overall the results present that two weather generators reproduce well the historic statistics of daily precipitation including the historic mean and standard deviation fig 4a and b on the other hand the two models generate biased skew and maximum values fig 4c and d the skew values are slightly overestimated in m c o u p l i n g whereas they are significantly underestimated in m s i m p l e this substantial underestimation indicates that the light tailed distributions may be limited in representing daily precipitation behaviors correlations of daily precipitation across sites are also presented in fig 4f again m c o u p l i n g performs better than m s i m p l e especially concerning correlations less than 0 75 the improved spatial dependences underscore the usefulness of the optimized correlation structures which is adopted in the proposed model a similar comparison for maximum and minimum temperatures is shown in fig 5 the results describe good performance in generating historical statistics here except for the inter site correlations the statistics for m s i m p l e are not presented since the methodologies to simulate temperatures are identical for both models an optimized spatial dependence module is adopted only in m c o u p l i n g leading to improved spatial temperature sequences across sites to investigate the reproduction of precipitation extremes fig 6 shows the distribution of 10 20 and 50 year maximum annual precipitation events for each month at the selected station labeled with an asterisk in fig 1 precipitation extreme estimates are developed by fitting a generalized extreme value gev distribution to the time series of regional precipitation sequences m s i m p l e tends to underestimate the magnitude of precipitation events furthermore the underestimation is more prevalent in high flow seasons highlighting that climate impact assessments with the output of m s i m p l e may be limited to representing precise hydrologic risks on the other hand m c o u p l i n g provides improved estimations for all three maximum events for example the spread of m c o u p l i n g simulations frequently contains the observed monthly values for a 20 year event although some high flow simulations are overestimated for a 50 year event these results suggest that the adopted heavy tailed distribution may prove promising for simulations of precipitation extremes statistics for annual precipitation and temperatures are presented in figs 7 and 8 mean precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures are well preserved in both models also the percentiles of these three annual variables are adequately captured by both models although m s i m p l e slightly overestimates the low percentiles while underestimating the high percentiles the standard deviations of annual variables are quite biased for both models however the biases are moderated by the proposed model indicating that coupling annual and daily generator models is beneficial in offsetting the significant underestimation of inter annual variability a similar conclusion is obtained in the statistics for correlation analysis the distributions of lag 1 autocorrelations and cross correlations among three variables across the 100 ensemble simulations are presented in fig 8 the observed values are less preserved in the distributions of the m s i m p l e statistics to be specific the lag 1 annual correlation for precipitation is considerably underestimated the bias is less obvious for m c o u p l i n g although the variances are substantial the large variance for all variables could be reduced if longer simulation periods were considered finally low frequency annual variability for three variables is examined through the global power spectrums fig 9 represents a comparison of the observed power spectrums and the averages for the 100 ensemble simulations with its 95 uncertainties bounds overall the mean simulated power spectrums follow the observations reasonably well for all three variables furthermore the mean simulated power spectrums become insignificant at around the 7 year period similar to the observations which are also addressed in fig 3 lastly the observed spectrums are within the 95 uncertainty bounds of simulations to sum up the weather generator with annual adjustments performs well with respect to reproducing the observed inter annual variability for the considered variables 5 alterations of statistical characteristics in climate simulations since many applications of weather generators evaluate the impact analysis of climate change the proposed weather generator is also tested by adjusting several parameters of the model as described in section 3 4 four different types of climate change are created here including alterations to the mean and standard deviation of daily temperatures shape parameters for the upper and lower parts of the e gpd distribution and the level of persistence of low frequency variability see table 1 similar to performance evaluation the proposed model is run 100 separate times each 50 years long with the imposed changes using geum river basin data in these simulations all adjustments are made as step changes rather than trended changes to explicitly confirm the outcome statistics fig 10 shows model runs demonstrating alterations to the mean standard deviation and low frequency persistence of annual values all other components of the climate system are unchanged from historic values comparison is made against historical observations to demonstrate how well the weather generator preserves inter annual variability under climate change simulations three important insights emerge from fig 10 first a diverse range of possible future simulations is possible while precipitation sequences for sim 1 emphasize changes in the low part of precipitation distribution precipitation sequences for sim 2 focus on alterations in the upper part of precipitation distribution also temperature outcomes for sim 1 and sim 3 demonstrate how the model could simulate a various range of outcomes for climate change assessments however the changes are slightly decreased from the designed alterations the decline is observed particularly in the standard deviations for example the new standard deviations σ sim 2 and σ sim 3 estimated for region averaged temperature are 0 84 and 1 17 while the imposed standard deviations are 0 96 and 1 30 respectively this is because the alterations are based on daily time steps requiring additional remedies for matching changes on annual time steps future work is needed for the corrections lastly inter annual variability is examined using the lag 1 autocorrelations even though four different alterations are imposed here all inter annual variabilities are relatively well preserved also the autocorrelations for simulation 4 are obviously increased compared to those of the observations as designed see table 1 overall the results indicate that the generated climate sequences may reliably evaluate the robustness of a water resource system for long term planning while preserving their low frequency persistence 6 conclusion weather generators are often employed to assess the risks of natural hazards e g droughts and floods many weather generators fail to represent the inter annual variability of a generated time series occasionally resulting in underrepresentation of extreme events in long term climate simulations this study proposes a multivariate and multisite stochastic weather generator which preserves both low and high frequency climate variabilities through applications to the geum river basin that include nine weather gauges two nested models m s i m p l e and m c o u p l i n g are compared to illustrate improvements in simulating diverse historical statistics when additional modules introduced in this study are adopted results show that the baseline model m s i m p l e is reasonably able to reproduce the mean of precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures as well as their distributions on daily time scales however m s i m p l e tends to underestimate the magnitude of extreme precipitation events and low frequency annual variability of the variables considered the proposed model m c o u p l i n g adopts a post processing technique by coupling annual and daily generator models to account for low frequency climate oscillations also a heavy tailed distribution is utilized to reproduce extreme precipitation events with optimized spatial dependence and copulas m c o u p l i n g performs well with respect to producing unobserved precipitation extremes multisite and multivariate dependencies and low frequency variability this study further illustrates utilization of the proposed model in an analysis of climate change assessments by adjusting its principal parameters which are likely sensitive to diverse aspects of climate change results indicate that inter annual variability is preserved well in the generated climate sequences when various alterations are imposed in each simulation however it is also observed that the framework should be further improved to simulate future climate scenarios precisely adjusted by imposed alterations while the focus of the weather generator is on simulating low and high frequency variabilities of climate variables there are some inherent limitations to the proposed weather generator low frequency variability is explored by a wavelet decomposition approach under this approach generation of annual timescales is achieved by providing random components with low frequency signals which is made possible by an autoregressive model estimating robust parameters for certain frequency components requires a sufficient length of time series also the wavelet decomposition approach may demand a non trended i e non increased or decreased time series if the time series is significantly increased the approach may identify spurious low frequency components kwon et al 2007 low frequency inter monthly variability is not considered in the proposed model although the underestimation is frequently addressed with weather generators chen et al 2019 a monthly weather generator could additionally be developed to refine the proposed model lastly we adopted a specific heavy tailed distribution to determine precipitation amounts simple simulation of precipitation amounts is limited to representing complex precipitation behavior this may be further improved by coupling the weather generator with a weather type approach i e by assuming that daily rainfall has to belong to a defined weather type driven by some specific atmospheric patterns accordingly the adopted distributions could be fitted for each weather type and consequently a mixture of distributions would represent the entire rainfall spectrum which offers a promising avenue for future work as future research for this proposed framework improved spatial modeling and extreme values will be utilized to verify if simulated floods using the generated climate sequences and the distributed hydrologic model provide more appropriate representation for observed floods this exploration is currently carried out with a distributed version of the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac

5911,multivariate and multisite stochastic weather generators have been proposed to produce an ensemble of climate time series but are often limited to preserving low frequency variability of climate variables as well as producing extreme rainfall events this study presents a new two stage multivariate multisite weather generator by coupling annual and daily weather generators a daily weather generator is first developed using heavy tailed distribution spatial tail dependence and multivariate autoregressive models for the second stage annual climate variables over the region are modeled using a wavelet decomposition approach coupled with a multivariate autoregressive model the generated annual time series are used to reconstruct daily simulations to embed multiple low frequency oscillations in a daily time series the proposed weather generator is applied to the geum river basin in south korea and its performance is compared to that of a nested simplified model results show that the proposed model performs well with respect to reproducing marginal distributional attributes multisite dependencies and climate variability at the daily and annual scales lastly the weather generator adopts a quantile mapping procedure to incorporate long term distributional changes into generated climate sequences for use in climate change assessments results show that inter annual

introduction many regions lack climate data necessitating realistic simulations of climate variables breinl et al 2017 a weather generator can produce a large ensemble of time series of climate variables and has proved a useful tool in an abundance of applications such as agricultural and water system management sparks et al 2018 supit et al 2012 analysis of climate change impact forsythe et al 2014 khazaei et al 2012 and assessment of extreme weather risk ehmele and kunz 2019 in particular a weather generator is often required to develop sequences of multiple weather variables at multiple locations while maintaining spatial and temporal dynamics as they are fundamental for impact analyses aghakouchak et al 2011 the focus of this paper is on the stochastic simulation of multi site climate variables which still needs further refinement a number of weather generators have been developed in the last three decades although the approaches differ in complexity they can be categorized based on non parametric apipattanavis et al 2010 king et al 2014 leander and buishand 2009 sharif and burn 2007 semi parametric breinl et al 2013 steinschneider and brown 2013 or

neighbor algorithm e g sharif and burn 2007 and a kernel density estimation method e g harrold et al 2003 have shown improved ability to capture nonlinearities between climate variables also these methods are relatively simple and can reproduce historical observations very well however they lack extrapolation ability which is needed to generate unobserved extremes i e drought or flooding events outside the range of observations one of the motivations for using stochastic weather generators semi parametric approaches that use both parametric and non parametric modules have proven well suited for generating multivariate climate sequences sparks et al 2018 but are not completely immune from the limitations of non parametric approaches parametric approaches often use chain dependent process katz 1977 fixed probability models and time series models although these types are limited in representing complex nonlinear inter variable dependence structure they are often preferred for climate change impact and extreme weather risk analyses due to their extrapolation capability preserving low and high frequencies such as inter annual variability and extreme events are the main issue discussed by many authors chen et al 2019 fatichi et al 2011 kilsby et al 2007 wilks 1999 also it has been noted that underestimation of inter annual variability and extreme precipitation events may represent the most difficult challenge in weather modeling fatichi et al 2011 kyselỳ and dubrovskỳ 2005 wilks and wilby 1999 underestimation of inter annual variability occasionally leads to underrepresentation of extreme events over long time periods sparks et al 2018 indicating that adopting modules to preserve both low and high frequency statistics may be much more important when a weather generator is employed for future climate conditions several studies have attempted to address underestimation by weather generators of low frequency variability however a majority of the studies have not been generalized to multisite applications chen et al 2010 dubrovskỳ et al 2004 fatichi et al 2011 wang and nathan 2007 only a few weather generators have considered low frequency variability in multisite applications steinschneider and brown 2013 proposed a semi parametric multisite weather generator for use in climate change studies they simulated low frequency climate frequency by using a wavelet decomposition coupled to a first order autoregressive ar1 model this weather generator is quite promising in simulating observed precipitation and temperature statistics e g mean standard deviation and multisite dependencies however the model underestimates temperature s inter annual variability also the weather generator has only limited ability to generate weather events outside the range of observations since it is based on a k nearest neighbor resampling technique with observed datasets li and babovic 2019a developed a two stage multivariate multisite weather generator after creating single site weather the model reproduces inter site dependencies and inter annual variability using empirical copulas in the second stage the generator performed reasonably well in reproducing the inter site dependencies and inter annual variability however post processing presents limitations as the rank structures are directly inherited from the historical record the length of the simulated meteorological series should be identical to that of the observation as such long period simulations e g 100 year are not possible the generator also lacks extrapolation ability which is a common problem when the non parametric approach is adopted similar limitations can be found in the model of li et al 2018 chen et al 2019 introduced a multisite weather generator which preserves low frequency climate variability by coupling annual monthly and daily weather generators in order to preserve low frequency variability of the climate variables the daily time series are incrementally adjusted by annual and monthly time series generated by monthly and annual ar1 models respectively although promising the natural correlation between daily precipitation characteristics e g number of wet days and annual monthly precipitation amounts is ignored in the adjustment procedure as a result it is theoretically possible that a large annual monthly precipitation be assigned to a small number of wet days leading to enormous extreme rainfall events similarly exaggeration can occur with correlation between annual monthly temperatures and the number of wet days because of wide use of light tailed distributions such as exponential gamma and weibull distributions weather generators often lead to an underestimation of extreme precipitation events papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 to mitigate this deficiency a non parametric has been employed to avoid specific distributional assumptions e g qian et al 2008 however mehrotra and sharma 2010 reported that the nonparametric approach e g gaussian kernel still suffers from underestimation although it offers the flexibility of precipitation fitting alternatively heavy tailed distributions are used to correct extreme precipitation behavior cavanaugh et al 2015 concluded that heavy tailed distributions are generally in better agreement with observed extremes information about future climate is frequently inferred from general circulation models gcms jiménez cisneros et al 2014 however there are well acknowledged deficiencies in the ability of gcms to represent regional climate fatichi et al 2011 li and babovic 2019b weather generators have provided an efficient complement to general circulation model gcms for investigating local water system performance e g ahn and kim 2019 chen et al 2018 in particular weather generators have been adopted in the bottom up vulnerable assessments to evaluate water system performance under a wide range of future climate scenarios brown and wilby 2012 ghile et al 2014 herman et al 2015 quinn et al 2018 consequently there is a need to develop a weather generator which is able to preserve low and high frequency variabilities when simulating future climate conditions based on the literature this study presents a multivariate and multisite stochastic weather generator which preserves low and high frequency climate variabilities furthermore the model can support analysis of climate change impact by adjusting its parameters which are sensitive to diverse aspects of climate change to account for low and high frequency climate oscillations our proposed model adopts a post processing technique by coupling annual and daily generator models an annual weather generator includes a wavelet decomposition coupled to a multivariate autoregressive model to demonstrate low frequency multivariate oscillations a daily weather generator consists of 1 a recently developed heavy tailed distribution papastathopoulos and tawn 2013 2 a student t copula to account for spatial dependence and 3 a multivariate autoregressive model to consider the effect of precipitation occurrence for temperature simulations lastly our proposed model is finalized with a quantile mapping procedure to demonstrate long term distributional shifts in climate variables under climate change this study evaluates the proposed model in comparison with a relatively parsimonious weather generator to present the impact of the various components e g low frequency oscillation extreme events adopted in the proposed model the structure of this paper is as follows the study area and data are described in section 2 the proposed model is presented in section 3 the model is evaluated with a summary of the results focusing on the reproduction of low and high frequency variabilities in section 4 section 5 illustrates the ability of the model to produce various climate sequences for use under climate change analysis the article then concludes with a discussion in section 6 2 description of study area and data this study focuses on the geum river basin located in the midwest part of south korea fig 1 that drains the geum river estuary into the yellow sea with a length of about 390 km and a drainage area of approximately 15 000 km2 since the basin is located in a transitional zone with different climates dominant climate phenomena in each season are fairly heterogeneous leading to strong seasonality ahn and kim 2019 in addition interannual precipitation is rather variable in the last 40 years average annual precipitation has been 1290 mm high and low of 1783 mm and 754 mm respectively with 106 wet days per year approximately two thirds of annual precipitation is concentrated in the summer high flow season spanning from late june to early september while precipitation in winter represents less than 10 of annual precipitation this particular basin is selected because the geum river has experienced several severe droughts resulting in decreased availability of water resources seo et al 2018 accordingly many studies have conducted climate change assessment of this region e g ahn and kim 2019 kim et al 2019 also the geum river covers an extensive area enabling a thorough evaluation of the proposed model with the weather sites experiencing diverse spatial and temporal relations to achieve the objectives of this study nine weather stations of the korea meteorological administration s automated surface observing system asos are selected fig 1 and daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature are included the data used covers a 45 year period from 1 january 1973 to 31 december 2017 3 methodologies the weather generator considered in this work couples annual and daily weather generators regional annual average precipitation and temperature are generated using a wavelet decomposition kwon et al 2007 and multivariate autoregressive model neumaier and schneider 2001 for simulating multiple low frequency oscillations in climate daily precipitation and temperature are generated using multisite weather generators akin to those in sparks et al 2018 and evin et al 2018 as post processing daily simulations are reconstructed by simulations of annual climate lastly time series of the generated climate variables are altered to enforce distributional shifts by a quantile mapping procedure an overview of the modeling framework is presented in fig 2 the sub models and algorithms used are demonstrated in detail below 3 1 multivariate annual weather generator consider x t s with time t 1 n represents a time series of annual area averaged climate variables s 1 s for a region note that this study considers three variables precipitation x prec and maximum x tmax and minimum temperatures x tmin this times series is decomposed into k orthogonal component series z k t s that represent various low frequency signals and a residual component ε t 1 x t s k 1 k z k t s ε t s a simulation of x t is generated with time series models of each frequency component and the residual noise following kwon et al 2007 the signals are modeled using autoregressive ar models but the residuals are modeled using multivariate ar models to consider inter variable oscillations 2 x t s k 1 k i 1 p k α k i z k t i s v k t i 1 p a i ε t i s ω s t where p k is the order of the ar model for the kth low frequency signals p is the order for the residual noise α k i and a i are the coefficients and coefficient matrices of the ar model and v k t and ω s t are independent identically distributed white noise processes wavelet decomposition is adopted to simulate the low frequency signals and residual noise eq 2 because the wavelet transform permits an orthogonal decomposition of the original time series in both the time and frequency domains it is very attractive in the context of additive decomposition theoretical background of the wavelet transformation can be found in kwon et al 2007 and torrence and compo 1998 also note that the orders p k and p of each ar model can be determined using the well known panelized likelihood function e g akaike information criteria aic akaike 1974 however the study simply uses a first order ar model following kwon et al 2007 3 2 multisite and multivariate daily weather generator this study first generates daily precipitation sequences x t prec as a pivot variable at each site j x j t prec is first modeled using a latent gaussian variable y j t prec 3 x j t prec q prec 1 y j t prec where q is a non decreasing distribution function for daily precipitation sequences the inverse nondecreasing function takes the form below to demonstrate zero values no precipitation days 4 q prec 1 y j t prec f prec 1 φ y j t prec if y j t prec d prec 0 if y j t prec d prec where f is the cumulative distribution function cdf φ is the standard normal cdf and d is the threshold for the gaussian variable below which the outcome is censored similar to baxevani and lennartsson 2015 and sparks et al 2018 a one step process is developed to simultaneously generate precipitation occurrence and amounts in this formulation temporal dependence of y prec is modeled using an ar model in particular a first order ar model is used in this study 5 y j t prec β 0 prec β 1 prec y j t 1 prec t prec where β 0 prec and β 1 prec are the constant and coefficient of the ar model respectively at site j and t prec is residual noise residual noise is often designed to follow a multi normal distribution to preserve spatial dependence however it provides almost zero dependence for the upper tail values as has often been criticized by previous studies e g aghakouchak et al 2010 to circumvent this limitation t prec is modeled by a student t copula to maintain tail dependence of spatial extreme precipitation events also previous studies reported that spatial dependence is not well preserved in the final generated time series keller et al 2015 which we also experienced while developing this model this difficulty arises mainly from a stochastic process that partly destroys the imposed correlation structure to mitigate this problem the correlation matrix of t prec is estimated based on an optimization procedure which in turn is based on a bisection method burden and faires 2011 that minimizes the difference between the generated spatial correlation and the target correlation of observations if the correlation matrix is not positive definite the nearest positive definite matrix is chosen higham 1988 rebonato and jäckel 2011 this optimization procedure is conducted prior to the actual generation simulation and performed for each month to account for the seasonality of the precipitation occurrence at each site j f prec is based on a relatively new distribution the e gpd extended generalized pareto distribution which was first proposed by papastathopoulos and tawn 2013 note that other heavy tailed distributions for daily precipitation amounts mixtures of gamma distribution and gpd proposed by vrac and naveau 2007 are also tested in this study however e gpd is parsimonious and computationally less expensive than the mixtures of gamma distribution and gpd so it is adopted in this study e gpd distribution is given by 6 f prec 1 φ y j t prec g ω ϑ φ y j t prec ζ η where 7 ω ϑ φ 1 1 ϑ φ 1 ϑ if ϑ 0 1 e φ if ϑ 0 where 1 ϑ φ is the function for max 1 ϑ φ 0 η is a scale parameter and g ϑ is equal to ϑ ζ ζ 0 overall three parameters η ζ a n d ϑ are required for each site in this study the tail index parameter ϑ is estimated by a non negative value ϑ 0 as suggested by serinaldi and kilsby 2014 e gpd distribution has an upper bound when ϑ 0 which is not realistic probability weight moments naveau et al 2016 are utilized to determine a parameter set for each site finally similar to precipitation sequences maximum and minimum temperatures x j t tmax and x j t tmin are modeled using latent gaussian variables see eqs 3 and 4 for these variables the thresholds dtmax and dtmin are set to the value of negative infinity implying that they are not lower bounded also temporal dependences of y tmax and y tmin are modeled using an ar model note that a fifth order ar model is utilized with an exogenous variable i e y j t prec which is decided by the panelized likelihood functions i e aic values before running the actual generation simulation 8 y j t max β 0 max τ 1 5 β τ max y j t τ max β 6 max y j t prec t max 9 y j t min β 0 min τ 1 5 β τ min y j t τ min β 6 min y j t prec t min similar to t prec the residual noises t tmax and t tmin are modeled to maintain a tail dependence of spatial extreme events by a student t copula and optimized correlation matrices however for the temperature simulations the optimized correlation matrices are composed of two correlation matrices and the cross correlation matrix between maximum and minimum temperatures c c tmax c tmaxtmin c tmaxtmin c tmin finally the normal distribution is utilized for the cdfs f tmax and f tmin 3 3 coupling annual and daily weather simulations daily weather simulations must be conditioned on annual climate simulations to preserve low frequency variability to accomplish this annual simulation is used to generate new daily simulation data for each simulation year that is comprised of a resampling of the generated daily simulation daily weather simulation is iteratively fit to each annual simulation and rearranged for a given simulation year the procedure is as follows 1 generate a simulation of regional annual climate variables precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures of length nannual using the annual weather generator described in section 3 1 2 generate a simulation of daily climate of length ndaily using the multi site daily weather generator presented in section 3 2 note that ndaily is set to be sufficiently greater than nannual to prevent duplicated simulations in the final data set 3 for a simulation year calculate the euclidean distances for each variable e s x t annual s x s 2 between the annual area averaged x and the vector of annual area averaged x obtained by the daily generator here each variable is scaled i e z score normalization to provide equivalent units for all s before calculating the euclidean distances 4 calculate the smallest distance for overall variable sets and determine the daily climate sequences corresponding to the smallest distance for the simulation year tannual 5 adjust the simulation of daily climate data set generated in step 2 by eliminating the daily climate sequences used in step 4 thus the length of the remaining simulation of daily climate set is ndaily 1 6 repeat steps 3 5 for all simulation years of length nannual the initial generations of annual and daily simulations steps 1 and 2 are from historic data for both a random year and a random day in the simulation starting month respectively also note that a monthly weather generator could additionally be developed to preserve the inter annual variability of the monthly series then daily weather simulation would be iteratively fit to annual and monthly simulations however a monthly weather generator is not considered in this study 3 4 incorporating long term changes into climate simulations the proposed model is not capable of altering the distribution of the variable considered under climate change many potential shifts are possible including changes in the mean and variance or extremes a wide range of changes can enable planners to evaluate how different assumptions of future climate conditions would impact the decision process as shown by brown et al 2011 2012 for example planners can develop system response surfaces that map planning relevant metrics and decision thresholds for those metrics across a wide range of plausible future climates this can help facilitate discussion between planners and help them reach a consensus on a decision to illustrate an example for a wide range of changes this study utilizes changes in the major parameters by incorporating a quantile mapping method into the proposed model to simulate a diverse range of future climate scenarios consider χ j t prec to be daily nonzero precipitation values for site j generated from the weather generator described in section 3 3 to impose new distributional shifts two parameters η ϑ which generate various changes of precipitation patterns in the low and upper parts of the e gpd distribution are utilized see eq 6 let historic and future simulate χ j t prec and χ j t prec simulated with parameter sets η ϑ and η ϑ respectively here the historic parameter set η ϑ can be estimated by fitting the χ j t prec simulation once the new parameters of the designed future conditions are determined a quantile mapping approach is used for the distribution f χ j t prec 10 χ j t prec f χ j t prec 1 f χ j t prec χ j t prec a similar process is undertaken for maximum and minimum temperatures χ j t tmax and χ j t tmin by assuming that historic and future simulated temperatures follow normal distributions once the new parameters of the designed future conditions are identified a quantile mapping approach is applied to the historic simulated temperatures this procedure is repeated for each month and location to account for the seasonality of the generated variables 4 application and performance evaluation to construct the low frequency signals eq 1 for a time series of annual area averaged climate variables wavelet power spectrums and associated global power spectrums are first utilized for observed annual variables fig 3 generally all historical time series exhibit a significant signal in a 4 7 year band a significant signal is modeled by using one low frequency component k 1 for our study basin in the proposed annual weather generator to evaluate the performance of the proposed weather generator m c o u p l i n g reproduction of key multiple properties of each weather variable is analyzed to achieve this the model is run 100 separate times each run being 50 years long referencing the geum river basin in addition this study generates climate scenarios using a relatively simple weather generator m s i m p l e to show the effects of the various components e g adjusted spatial correlations extreme rainfall events annual low frequency oscillation adopted in m c o u p l i n g m s i m p l e uses a latent gaussian variable eq 3 and gamma distribution to determine precipitation occurrence and to simulate precipitation amounts on wet days then m s i m p l e produces maximum and minimum temperature sequences by using a fifth order ar model with an exogenous variable i e zero inflated precipitation which is also comparable to m c o u p l i n g for temperature simulations note that m s i m p l e is different from m c o u p l i n g regarding the modules for 1 preserving annual low frequency variability 2 adopting a heavy tailed distribution for precipitation and 3 modeling spatial dependence using an optimization procedure and a student t copula fig 4 presents observed and simulated daily precipitation statistics for two models m c o u p l i n g and m s i m p l e and all nine gauges over the geum river basin the median values for all statistics are calculated for each month the 45 line indicates perfect model performance overall the results present that two weather generators reproduce well the historic statistics of daily precipitation including the historic mean and standard deviation fig 4a and b on the other hand the two models generate biased skew and maximum values fig 4c and d the skew values are slightly overestimated in m c o u p l i n g whereas they are significantly underestimated in m s i m p l e this substantial underestimation indicates that the light tailed distributions may be limited in representing daily precipitation behaviors correlations of daily precipitation across sites are also presented in fig 4f again m c o u p l i n g performs better than m s i m p l e especially concerning correlations less than 0 75 the improved spatial dependences underscore the usefulness of the optimized correlation structures which is adopted in the proposed model a similar comparison for maximum and minimum temperatures is shown in fig 5 the results describe good performance in generating historical statistics here except for the inter site correlations the statistics for m s i m p l e are not presented since the methodologies to simulate temperatures are identical for both models an optimized spatial dependence module is adopted only in m c o u p l i n g leading to improved spatial temperature sequences across sites to investigate the reproduction of precipitation extremes fig 6 shows the distribution of 10 20 and 50 year maximum annual precipitation events for each month at the selected station labeled with an asterisk in fig 1 precipitation extreme estimates are developed by fitting a generalized extreme value gev distribution to the time series of regional precipitation sequences m s i m p l e tends to underestimate the magnitude of precipitation events furthermore the underestimation is more prevalent in high flow seasons highlighting that climate impact assessments with the output of m s i m p l e may be limited to representing precise hydrologic risks on the other hand m c o u p l i n g provides improved estimations for all three maximum events for example the spread of m c o u p l i n g simulations frequently contains the observed monthly values for a 20 year event although some high flow simulations are overestimated for a 50 year event these results suggest that the adopted heavy tailed distribution may prove promising for simulations of precipitation extremes statistics for annual precipitation and temperatures are presented in figs 7 and 8 mean precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures are well preserved in both models also the percentiles of these three annual variables are adequately captured by both models although m s i m p l e slightly overestimates the low percentiles while underestimating the high percentiles the standard deviations of annual variables are quite biased for both models however the biases are moderated by the proposed model indicating that coupling annual and daily generator models is beneficial in offsetting the significant underestimation of inter annual variability a similar conclusion is obtained in the statistics for correlation analysis the distributions of lag 1 autocorrelations and cross correlations among three variables across the 100 ensemble simulations are presented in fig 8 the observed values are less preserved in the distributions of the m s i m p l e statistics to be specific the lag 1 annual correlation for precipitation is considerably underestimated the bias is less obvious for m c o u p l i n g although the variances are substantial the large variance for all variables could be reduced if longer simulation periods were considered finally low frequency annual variability for three variables is examined through the global power spectrums fig 9 represents a comparison of the observed power spectrums and the averages for the 100 ensemble simulations with its 95 uncertainties bounds overall the mean simulated power spectrums follow the observations reasonably well for all three variables furthermore the mean simulated power spectrums become insignificant at around the 7 year period similar to the observations which are also addressed in fig 3 lastly the observed spectrums are within the 95 uncertainty bounds of simulations to sum up the weather generator with annual adjustments performs well with respect to reproducing the observed inter annual variability for the considered variables 5 alterations of statistical characteristics in climate simulations since many applications of weather generators evaluate the impact analysis of climate change the proposed weather generator is also tested by adjusting several parameters of the model as described in section 3 4 four different types of climate change are created here including alterations to the mean and standard deviation of daily temperatures shape parameters for the upper and lower parts of the e gpd distribution and the level of persistence of low frequency variability see table 1 similar to performance evaluation the proposed model is run 100 separate times each 50 years long with the imposed changes using geum river basin data in these simulations all adjustments are made as step changes rather than trended changes to explicitly confirm the outcome statistics fig 10 shows model runs demonstrating alterations to the mean standard deviation and low frequency persistence of annual values all other components of the climate system are unchanged from historic values comparison is made against historical observations to demonstrate how well the weather generator preserves inter annual variability under climate change simulations three important insights emerge from fig 10 first a diverse range of possible future simulations is possible while precipitation sequences for sim 1 emphasize changes in the low part of precipitation distribution precipitation sequences for sim 2 focus on alterations in the upper part of precipitation distribution also temperature outcomes for sim 1 and sim 3 demonstrate how the model could simulate a various range of outcomes for climate change assessments however the changes are slightly decreased from the designed alterations the decline is observed particularly in the standard deviations for example the new standard deviations σ sim 2 and σ sim 3 estimated for region averaged temperature are 0 84 and 1 17 while the imposed standard deviations are 0 96 and 1 30 respectively this is because the alterations are based on daily time steps requiring additional remedies for matching changes on annual time steps future work is needed for the corrections lastly inter annual variability is examined using the lag 1 autocorrelations even though four different alterations are imposed here all inter annual variabilities are relatively well preserved also the autocorrelations for simulation 4 are obviously increased compared to those of the observations as designed see table 1 overall the results indicate that the generated climate sequences may reliably evaluate the robustness of a water resource system for long term planning while preserving their low frequency persistence 6 conclusion weather generators are often employed to assess the risks of natural hazards e g droughts and floods many weather generators fail to represent the inter annual variability of a generated time series occasionally resulting in underrepresentation of extreme events in long term climate simulations this study proposes a multivariate and multisite stochastic weather generator which preserves both low and high frequency climate variabilities through applications to the geum river basin that include nine weather gauges two nested models m s i m p l e and m c o u p l i n g are compared to illustrate improvements in simulating diverse historical statistics when additional modules introduced in this study are adopted results show that the baseline model m s i m p l e is reasonably able to reproduce the mean of precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures as well as their distributions on daily time scales however m s i m p l e tends to underestimate the magnitude of extreme precipitation events and low frequency annual variability of the variables considered the proposed model m c o u p l i n g adopts a post processing technique by coupling annual and daily generator models to account for low frequency climate oscillations also a heavy tailed distribution is utilized to reproduce extreme precipitation events with optimized spatial dependence and copulas m c o u p l i n g performs well with respect to producing unobserved precipitation extremes multisite and multivariate dependencies and low frequency variability this study further illustrates utilization of the proposed model in an analysis of climate change assessments by adjusting its principal parameters which are likely sensitive to diverse aspects of climate change results indicate that inter annual variability is preserved well in the generated climate sequences when various alterations are imposed in each simulation however it is also observed that the framework should be further improved to simulate future climate scenarios precisely adjusted by imposed alterations while the focus of the weather generator is on simulating low and high frequency variabilities of climate variables there are some inherent limitations to the proposed weather generator low frequency variability is explored by a wavelet decomposition approach under this approach generation of annual timescales is achieved by providing random components with low frequency signals which is made possible by an autoregressive model estimating robust parameters for certain frequency components requires a sufficient length of time series also the wavelet decomposition approach may demand a non trended i e non increased or decreased time series if the time series is significantly increased the approach may identify spurious low frequency components kwon et al 2007 low frequency inter monthly variability is not considered in the proposed model although the underestimation is frequently addressed with weather generators chen et al 2019 a monthly weather generator could additionally be developed to refine the proposed model lastly we adopted a specific heavy tailed distribution to determine precipitation amounts simple simulation of precipitation amounts is limited to representing complex precipitation behavior this may be further improved by coupling the weather generator with a weather type approach i e by assuming that daily rainfall has to belong to a defined weather type driven by some specific atmospheric patterns accordingly the adopted distributions could be fitted for each weather type and consequently a mixture of distributions would represent the entire rainfall spectrum which offers a promising avenue for future work as future research for this proposed framework improved spatial modeling and extreme values will be utilized to verify if simulated floods using the generated climate sequences and the distributed hydrologic model provide more appropriate representation for observed floods this exploration is currently carried out with a distributed version of the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac

surface runoff and infiltration partition is a primary process of hydrologic cycle here we compare four different surface runoff and infiltration partition methods within a richards equation based swat model rswat to understand their effects on watershed modeling four surface runoff and infiltration partition methods include a daily curve number method dcn rswat a hourly curve number method hcn rswat a green ampt method ga rswat and an effective infiltration capacity method eic rswat these four versions of rswat and a daily curve number based original swat dcn swat were applied to simulate daily stream flow and baseflow from 2001 to 2015 at the tuckahoe creek watershed tcw and greensboro watershed gw in maryland us the global sensitivity analysis algorithms within swat cup was used to identify sensitive parameters and the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 was used to analyze uncertainty for different models in both calibration and validation periods comparison of the results from different models highlight the sensitivity of watershed modeling to the differences between surface runoff and infiltration partition methods in general dcn rswat outperformed other versions of rswat and the standard swat model with reduced daily flow rate perdition uncertainty and improved simulation of daily baseflow in both test watersheds we anticipate the numerical experiments examined here will provide new insights into better practices in choosing surface runoff and infiltration partition methods for swat and other watershed models thereby supporting sustainable water resources assessment and management keywords sensitivity analysis calibration validation uncertainty swat cup 1 introduction how much precipitation snowmelt is divided into surface and subsurface water is critically important to watershed scale hydrological modeling einstein 1945 accurate estimation of surface and subsurface water not only determines the success of modeling the hydrograph in streams moisture distribution in soils and evapotranspiration from watersheds but also is crucial in estimating biogeochemical processes nutrient leaching and transport and plant growth sun et al 2015 xia et al 2014 surface runoff supplies the most of problems in flood control water utilization soil erosion and water quality degradation blanchoud et al 2007 louchart et al 2001 probst 1985 simard et al 2000 turtola and jaakkola 1995 chemicals applied to soil surfaces can be rapidly mobilized and transferred to streams and water bodies by surface runoff and via the movement of sediment surface runoff is often the main source of low solubility pesticide compounds to water bodies and one of the main contributors of phosphorus to aquatic ecosystems thus surface runoff plays an important role in many environmental issues such as the flooding and water contamination and eutrophication appels et al 2011 bolinder et al 2000 deasy et al 2009 van der velde et al 2009 infiltrated water is available to plants and is evaporated or transpired or percolated into ground water soil moisture controls the biogeochemical processes in soil profile and is able to significantly affect the regional atmospheric budgets of water and energy liang and xie 2001 infiltration mobilizes substances such as nitrate and soluble metabolites of pesticides leading to groundwater contamination meanwhile best management practices bmps which favor infiltration and reduce surface runoff is important for increasing water storage in soil profiles in dry regions einstein 1945 determination of surface runoff and infiltration depends on many factors such as precipitation intensity and duration infiltration properties of the soil antecedent soil moisture height of the groundwater table and topography chen et al 2014 liang and xie 2001 different models treat those processes with different strategies depending on the time step and spatial discretization and the problem the model aims to solve most of soil moisture simulation models using a small time step e g less than one minute have the capability of estimating the instantaneous hydraulic conductivity at the soil surface and infiltration can be subsequently calculated for that time step however for watershed scale models using a larger time step e g daily a lumped method is more effective to partition participation into surface runoff and infiltration the soil conservation service scs curve number cn equation is one of those methods widely used in watershed scale models ponce and hawkins 1996 another popular method for watershed scale models is the green ampt infiltration method modified for large time steps green and ampt 1911 for these one dimensional field scale models with a small time step richards equation is often employed to simulate water flow and moisture redistribution in the soil profile hutson and wagenet 1989 rojas and hanson 2000 whereas watershed scale models tend to use more simple soil water formulations such as those tipping bucket approaches kendy et al 2003 neitsch et al 2011a in a previous study qi et al 2018b a richards equation based soil moisture module was incorporated with a watershed scale model i e the soil and water assessment tool swat to simulate soil water flow and moisture distribution since the soil moisture module runs at a smaller time step i e hourly a question arose concerning how to determine the surface boundary flux i e which method should be used to determine surface runoff and infiltration at the watershed scale here we investigate different participation snowmelt partition methods within the richards equation based swat model the swat model is a watershed scale model which is designed to simulate hydrological processes and predict water quantity and quality as affected by management practices and landuse and climate change scenarios arnold et al 1998 it provides a flexible framework that allows for assessing the impact of a broad range of bmps such as cover crops filter strips conservation tillage irrigation management and terraces gassman et al 2005 li et al 2014 liu et al 2008 qi et al 2018a ullrich and volk 2009 zhang et al 2017 zhang 2018 zhang et al 2013a the swat model has been used worldwide to solve complex watershed management problems and modified for different study purposes bärlund et al 2007 fu et al 2014 krysanova and arnold 2008 qi et al 2017a qi et al 2016a qi et al 2016b qi et al 2017b qi et al 2019 srinivasan et al 2010 van griensven et al 2012 wu and liu 2012 zhang et al 2013b in swat surface runoff is simulated using either the modified cn method neitsch et al 2011a or the green ampt infiltration model green and ampt 1911 depending on the availability of daily or hourly precipitation data water infiltrated into the soil profile is redistributed using a storage routing technique a tipping bucket model narasimhan et al 2005 this simple storage routing method has been tested in several studies with results suggesting that it tended to under estimate soil water content due to its lack of accounting for water retention effects in soil profile li et al 2010 luo et al 2008 mapfumo et al 2004 qi et al 2018b has incorporated a richards equation based soil moisture module with swat and tested its performance in simulating soil moisture across 10 monitoring stations near the chesapeake bay in maryland their results indicated much improvement in soil moisture prediction compared with the original bucket model in swat the performance of the richards equation based swat hereafter referred to as rswat at the watershed scale however was not assessed yet the simulated hydrograph at the outlet of a watershed is largely determined by the method used in partitioning surface and subsurface runoff since rswat ran at a sub daily time step the original cn method and green ampt method in swat run at daily time step need to be modified to provide a sufficiently accurate surface boundary condition for richards equation based soil moisture module in addition an effective infiltration capacity method which is commonly used for richards equation applications at field scale was also used as comparison nearing et al 1996 the objectives of the present study are to 1 test four different surface runoff and infiltration partition methods in the richards equation based swat model with parameter sensitivity and prediction uncertainty analyses 2 investigate the model performance of richards equation based swat with different surface runoff and infiltration partition methods 3 compare model performance between richards equation based swat and the original swat at two watersheds in maryland us in order to compare model performance a procedure of parameter sensitivity and model uncertainty analyses and model calibration and validation using swat cup abbaspour 2013 were proposed and used here 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area and data collection we used two adjacent watersheds defined by u s geological survey usgs gate stations at the tuckahoe creak near ruthsburg usgs 01491500 and the choptank river near greensboro usgs 01491000 which are referred to as the tuckahoe creek watershed tcw 220 7 km2 and greensboro watershed gw 290 1 km2 fig 1 respectively they are located at the headwaters of the choptank river watershed crw in the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed in northeastern us fig 1 in tcw major land uses are agriculture 54 0 and forestry 32 8 in comparison gw has a higher percentage of forest 48 3 and a lower percentage of agricultural area 36 1 tcw is dominated by well drained soils 56 1 hydrologic soil group hsg a b where 69 5 of the area are under croplands lee et al 2016 whereas a large portion of soils 74 5 in gw is poorly drained hsg c d in which 67 2 of croplands are located ator and denver 2015 the major soil types found under cropland in the crw are typified by the othello soil series fine silty mixed active mesic typic endoaquults and the mattapex soil series fine silty mixed active mesic aquic hapludults othello soils are poorly drained with moderately slow permeability and mattapex soils are moderately well drained with moderate or moderately slow permeability hively et al 2009 in general the landscape in crw is nearly flat most slopes 2 the area is characterized by a temperate humid climate with an average annual temperature of 15 4 c and precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year with an average value of 1200 mm year 1 ator et al 2005 yeo et al 2014 the swat model requires detailed information on the climate soils and land use for the study site lee et al 2017 daily flow rate data for tcw and gw were downloaded from usgs gauge stations near ruthsburg usgs 01491500 and greensboro usgs 01491000 respectively a soil map was derived based on the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs soil survey geographic database ssurgo topography was delineated by resampling a 1 m light detection and ranging lidar based digital elevation model to 10 m using nearest neighbor interpolation the land use map and the scheduling of crop rotations were generated using 2008 2012 data from the usda national agriculture statistics service nass cropland data layer cdl for more information regarding swat model setup for these two watersheds please refer to lee et al 2016 hourly weather inputs for swat including precipitation temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were derived from the nasa north american land data assimilation system 2 nldas2 ldas gsfc nasa gov nldas climate forcing data nldas2 has assimilated multiple sources of climate observations and is widely recognized as a high resolution 1 8 degree spatially continuous and comprehensive dataset that is valuable for water cycling studies xia et al 2012 2 2 richards equation based swat rswat soil water moves constantly in direction of potential energy i e wet to dry soil where the gradient of potential energy with distance is the moving force causing flow soil matric potential h is defined as the work water can do as it moves from its present state to the reference state in the soil the reference state is the energy level of water at saturation h 0 this process can be described using the well known richards equation a modified richards equation zeng and decker 2009 has been incorporated in swat i e 1 θ t z k h h e z q where θ is the volumetric soil water content mm3 mm 3 t is time s z is the depth below soil surface mm positive downwards k is the hydraulic conductivity mm s 1 h is the soil matric potential mm q is a soil water sink term mm mm 1 s 1 and he is the equilibrium soil matric potential mm based on the default configuration of soil layers within swat we divided one soil layer into three sub layers which were equal in thickness and had the same physical and chemical properties of the default soil layer from which they were derived it is worth noting that the first soil layer 10 mm was not divided into three sub layers the new soil moisture module run at an hourly time step fig 2 the vertical soil moisture transport was governed by infiltration surface and lateral flow as well as transpiration through root extraction and evaporation from soil surface fig 2 free draining was assumed for the bottom boundary condition for the present study the penman monteith equation was employed to calculate evaporation transpiration we modified the existing swat dynamic storage equation to estimate hourly lateral flow neitsch et al 2011a and the existing groundwater module was also modified to simulate hourly groundwater recharge and discharge fig 2 evaporation transpiration and lateral flow were sink terms in the richards equation based soil moisture module fig 2 the instantaneous hydraulic conductivity is estimated using the method of community land model clm oleson et al 2010 the saturated conductivity is measured and provided in each hru based on usda natural resources conservation service nrcs soil survey geographic database ssurgo calculated hourly values such as surface runoff infiltration percolation between soil layers lateral flow and recharge and discharge for groundwater were aggregated at the last time step of the day and used for other swat daily processes detailed information regarding the model development and evaluation can be found in qi et al 2018b 2 3 surface runoff and infiltration calculation in the present study four methods were used to partition surface runoff and infiltration in rswat i e daily curve number method dcn rswat hourly curve number method hcn rswat green ampt method ga rswat and effective infiltration capacity method eic rswat the calculated infiltration was the surface boundary flux for the richards equation based soil moisture module all these methods can be calibrated with moisture condition ii curve number cn2 which is closely related to many bmps effects 2 3 1 daily curve number method dc daily surface runoff and infiltration were determined first based on the existing daily curve number method in swat neitsch et al 2011a given as 2 q surf r day 0 2 s 2 r day 0 8 s where qsurf is the accumulated runoff mm day 1 rday is the rainfall depth for the day mm day 1 and s is the retention parameter mm day 1 which is determined by 3 s 25 4 1000 cn 10 where cn is the daily curve number eq 3 is used to calculate daily cn by arranging its form as 4 cn 25400 s 254 and s is determined by 5 s s max 1 sw s w e x p w 1 w 2 s w where smax is the maximum value of retention on a given day mm day 1 sw is the soil water content of the entire profile and w1 and w2 are shape coefficients parameter w1 and w2 were functions of amount of water in soil profile at field capacity fc and at saturation sat mm day 1 and retention parameters mm day 1 corresponding to moisture conditions i and iii i e rmax and r3 which were calculated by eq 3 using moisture condition i and iii curve number i e cn1 and cn3 respectively moisture condition i and iii curve number were determined by moisture condition ii curve number cn2 which can be calibrated neitsch et al 2011b moisture condition i ii and iii curve number i e cn1 cn2 and cn3 representing dry average and wet antecedent soil moisture conditions respectively to calculate hourly surface boundary condition for the richards equation based soil moisture module an infiltration ratio r was given as 6 r q inf r day where q inf is the daily infiltration mm day 1 thus hourly infiltration q inf h within the day was then calculated by 7 q inf h r h r where r h is the hourly rainfall mm h 1 and hourly surface runoff q surf h mm h 1 was determined as 8 q surf h r h 1 r 2 3 2 hourly curve number method hc for the hourly curve number method hourly surface runoff is calculated by 9 q surf h r h 0 2 s h 2 r h 0 8 s h 10 s h 25 4 1000 cn h 10 where s h is the hourly retention parameter mm h 1 and cn h is the hourly curve number which is updated in each time step the formulation to calculate hourly retention parameter and curve number remained the same as that for daily curve number eqs 4 and 5 except that soil profile water content were updated hourly from richards equation then the hourly infiltration is given by 11 q inf h r h q surf h 2 3 3 green ampt method ga the existing green ampt infiltration method in swat was used to calculate hourly surface runoff instead of directly generating hourly infiltration the green ampt method provides accumulated infiltration values within a day to calculate hourly infiltration we use 12 q inf h q a c c i n f i q a c c i n f i 1 where q a c c i n f i is the accumulated infiltration mm at time step i i ranges from 1 to 24 2 3 4 effective infiltration capacity method eic the effective infiltration capacity k e mm hour 1 was calculated according to nearing et al 1996 given by 13 k e 56 82 k sat 0 286 1 0 051 exp 0 062 c n 2 where ksat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity mm hour 1 for the surface layer cn is the daily cue number then the surface runoff and infiltration were then determined by 14 q surf h r h k e and q inf h k e if r h k e q surf h 0 and q inf h r h if r h k 2 4 parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analyses and model calibration and validation the four versions of rswat model and daily curve number based swat dcn swat were used to simulate daily flow rate at the outlets of two study watersheds from 2001 to 2015 dcn swat serves as a benchmark for assessing model performance of the rswat based models relative to the original swat model the daily precipitation used for dcn rswat and dcn swat was derived from hourly data it is worth noting that the input for four versions of rswat models and dcn swat remained the same in order to compare performances of different versions of swat model we summarized and modified the procedure proposed in abbaspour et al 2015 the procedures for model parameter selection sensitivity and uncertainty analyses and model calibration and validation for model comparison are described as follows 1 parameter selection parameters were selected based on literature and analyst s expertise 2 sensitivity analysis the same set of selected parameters are used for all models to conduct sensitivity analysis initial ranges are assigned to parameters based on experience and hydrological knowledge of the analyst 3 uncertainty analysis all models are run with the same times e g 300 1000 times for each iteration depending on the number of parameters speed of the model execution and the system capabilities abbaspour et al 2015 after all simulations are completed for one iteration the post processing option in swat cup will suggest new parameter ranges for the next iteration abbaspour et al 2015 suggested new parameter ranges could be modifies by the user manually according to user s expertise and sensitivity analysis after each iteration here we keep the new parameter ranges unchanged most importantly total number of iterations remains the same for all models in total 3 5 iterations would be enough 4 calibration and validation after all simulations are completed for the last iteration the post processing option of swat cup calculates the objective function value and the 95ppu for all observed variables in the calibration period the final objective function value e g nash sutcliffe coefficient ns and other statistic coefficients e g coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias are also provided for the best simulation of the last iteration and a corresponding set of parameter values are determined this set of parameters were used to run models for validation periods to get the prediction for validation the 95ppu for validation period is calculated by running swat cup with the set of parameter ranges and number of simulations for the last iteration we choose the most frequently calibrated parameters for daily flow from the literature abbaspour et al 2007b arnold et al 2012 and previous studies conducted in the study watersheds lee et al 2017 lee et al 2016 five parameters were selected for sensitivity analysis to explore how these parameters were different in sensitivity for different models table 1 these parameters include moisture condition ιι curve number cn2 surface runoff lag time surlag day saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k mm h 1 baseflow recession constant alpha bf day and groundwater recharge delay days gw delay day the initial ranges of these parameters were determined based on preliminary sensitivity analysis for each model parameter sensitivities were determined using the following multiple regression equation given as 15 g α i 1 m β i b i where g is the objective function value α and βi are regression coefficients bi is the calibration parameter of the ith parameter and m is the number of parameters considered 5 in the present study nash sutcliffe coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 was used as the objective function value and student t tests were used to identify the statistical significance of each parameter this global sensitivity analysis approach is like that used in swat cup and it estimates the change in the objective function ns in the present study resulting from changes in each parameter while all other parameters are changing it has the advantage of being quite fast compared to similar procedures and it does not provide an absolute measure of the sensitivity but rather a relative sensitivity the t stat is the coefficient of a parameter divide by its standard error and it measure the precision of the regression coefficient the larger the absolute value of t stat the higher probability that the parameter is sensitive the p value was used to identify the relative sensitivity of parameters and a p value 0 05 indicated a sensitive parameter in the present study we conducted uncertainty analysis using sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 procedure in swat cup abbaspour et al 2007a the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu is the combined outcome of the uncertainties in model structure parameters and input data in sufi 2 these uncertainty sources are not separately estimated but are attributed as total model uncertainty to the parameters the p factor indicates the percentage of observed data falling within 95ppu band and the r factor is the average thickness of the 95ppu bands by the standard deviation of the observed data the r factor can vary between 0 i e achievement of a small uncertainty bound and infinity while the p factor can vary from 0 to 100 i e all observations bracketed by the predictionuncertainty singh et al 2014 the goodness of fit and the degree to which the calibrated model accounts for uncertainties are assessed by the above two measures parameters used in uncertainty analysis and their initial ranges remained the same as in sensitivity analysis table 1 uncertainty analysis was conduct for the period of 2001 2007 i e the calibration period ns was employed as the objective function because it is the most commonly used goodness of fit coefficient in hydrology modeling studies and based on ns many model performance evaluation criteria has been established by moriasi et al 2007 we implemented sufi 2 with five iterations and each iteration had 500 simulations for each version of swat model after the last iteration the finalized parameter ranges were used in swat cup to calculate 95ppu and p factor and r factor for the period of 2008 2015 i e the validation period the best simulation parameter values were also used to predict daily flow rate at the outlets of two watersheds from 2008 and 2015 the best simulation results during calibration and validation were used for model accuracy performance evaluation 2 5 baseflow calculation ideal model calibration and validation should consider a complete set of hydrological data if they are available moriasi et al 2007 since very few watersheds have differentially monitored baseflow and surface runoff data separating baseflow and surface runoff from measured total streamflow is often conducted to evaluate model performance on water balance in the present study we used the ecohydrology package in r program to calculate daily baseflow from daily streamflow at the outlets of tcw and gw the package is based on the widely used baseflow and surface separation method provided by nathan and mcmahon 1990 the package needs two parameters to calculate baseflow i e filter parameter and passes and they were set as 0 925 and 3 in the present study respectively as discussed in https cran r project org web packages ecohydrology ecohydrology pdf 2 6 model performance evaluation for reliable model evaluation a combination of different efficiency criteria complemented by the assessment of the absolute or relative error is recommended krause et al 2005 performance of four versions of rswat and dcn swat on daily flow rate simulation was assessed using three well known statistical criteria i e pbias r2 and ns given as 16 p bias 100 o avg p avg o avg 17 ns 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o avg 2 18 r 2 i 1 n o i o avg p i p avg i 1 n o i o avg 2 i 1 n p i p avg 2 0 5 2 where oi and pi are the observed and predicted values oavg and pavg are the average of the observed and predicted values the r2 ranges from 0 to 1 and explains the proportion of variance in observed data with higher values indicating less error variance the ns is a normalized statistic and estimates the relative magnitude of the residual variance as compared to the observed nash and sutcliffe 1970 and demonstrates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line and pbias has the ability to indicate poor model performance and measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than observed data low values of pbias indicate accurate model simulation positive values indicate model underestimation bias and negative values indicate model overestimation bias gupta et al 1999 the three statistical criteria were also used to evaluate model performance on daily baseflow simulation from 2001 to 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameter sensitivity analysis parameter sensitivity was measured by t stat and p value based on student t tests and the results are summarized in table 2 as expected moisture condition ιι curve number cn2 was sensitive for most models p value 0 05 except for ga rswat in both watersheds and hcn rswat in gw saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k was not sensitive for dcn rswat and dcn swat and both groundwater parameters i e baseflow recession constant day alpha bf and groundwater recharge delay days day gw delay were not sensitive for the four versions of rswat in the two watersheds table 2 sol k was the commonly sensitive parameter for three versions of rswat may be due to the fact that their surface runoff and infiltration partition algorithms use hourly participation while dcn rswat and dcn swat only considered daily precipitation aggregated from hourly input in addition since sensitivity of one parameter is often dependent on the values of other parameters abbaspour et al 2017 sol k became so influential in hourly time step model that the influence of cn2 in the multi variate regression equation eq 15 might be reduced for ga rswat in both watersheds and for hcn rswat in gw besides the increasing influence of sol k as stated above groundwater parameters i e alpha bf and gw delay became less sensitive for the rswat models because the movement of soil water was restricted by richards equation based module qi et al 2018b as a result the linkage between soil water and groundwater dynamics were weaker compared the original algorithm of swat this result suggests that a better groundwater module is needed to better predict groundwater discharge responding to restricted recharge from soil profile when richards equation based soil water module is used note that t stat for cn2 surlag and alpha bf was negative and t stat for gw delay was positive for all five models in tcw and gw this means that in order to increase the value of objective function ns values of cn2 surlag and alpha bf should be reduced and values of gw delay should be increased for all five models in addition sol k had positive t stat for the four rswat models while t stat of sol k was negative for dcn swat in both watersheds table 2 it seems that increasing sol k tended to increase ns for the rswat models while reduce ns for dcn swat however if the corresponding p value of a t stat is 0 05 positive negative signs of t stat is not significant that is we can only draw conclusion on parameters with p value 0 05 for example we can conclude that reducing cn2 could increase ns for dcn rswat hcn rswat eic rswat and dcn swat but probably not for ga rswat table 2 3 2 model uncertainty analysis the 95ppu for the four versions of rswat and dcn swat with the daily observed and best simulated flow rate for the calibration and validation periods in tcw and gw are illustrated in figs 3 6 respectively the shaded area 95ppu include all uncertainties which is quantified by p factor and r factor table 3 p factor 0 7 and r factor around 1 indicates a model had acceptable prediction uncertainty abbaspour 2013 in the present study we extended the upper limit of r factor to 1 2 which could be a reasonable estimation for our study results dcn rswat had the greatest p factor 0 86 for tcw and gw and ga rswat had the lowest p factor 0 66 and 0 46 for tcw and gw respectively in the calibration period among the four versions of rswat for both watersheds table 3 hcn rswat attained equal p factor to that of eic rswat for tcw while eic rswat achieved larger p factor than that of hcn rswat for gw table 3 the r factor based assessment is different from that using p factor for example in calibration period eic rswat had the greatest r factor 1 76 and 1 57 for tcw and gw respectively and ga rswat had the lowest r factor 0 69 and 0 53 for tcw and gw respectively among four versions of rswat and for both watersheds table 3 overall the percentage of observed flow rate bracketed by the 95ppu of dcn rswat was higher than those of hcn rswat ga rswat and eic rswat figs 3 6 ga rswat achieved a narrower prediction interval than those of other rswat models figs 3 6 the r factor and p factor assessment results in calibration in general translate into the validation period except that eic rswat attained less p factor than dcn rswat in calibration but higher in validation period table 3 based on the statistics in table 3 there is a clear trade off between p factor and r factor for model uncertainty evaluation a larger p factor can be achieved at the expense of a larger r factor while a smaller r factor often accompanies a smaller p factor a model with a balance between the two factors can provide acceptable prediction uncertainty based on the criteria for acceptable prediction uncertainty i e p factor 0 7 and r factor 1 2 for the present study hcn rswat for tcw and dcn rswat for gw were acceptable models in the calibration period table 3 in the validation period hcn rswat and dcn rswat for tcw and dcn rswat and eic rswat for gw were acceptable models table 3 in total among the four rswat based models dcn rswat was the model achieving acceptable performance for most cases for the two watersheds compared with dcn swat dcn rswat had higher p factor 0 86 vs 0 82 in tcw and 0 86 vs 0 79 in gw respectively and lower r factor 1 39 vs 1 55 in tcw and 1 13 vs 1 18 in gw respectively in the calibration period table 3 the same pattern was observed in the validation period table 3 apparently dcn rswat better represent uncertainties than dcn swat for daily flow rate more which is likely due to a more physical representation of soil water flow by richards equation 3 3 model accuracy evaluation the calibrated parameters generating the best simulation of the last iteration during uncertainty analysis are shown in table 4 statistical indices of model performance in calibration and validation periods for four versions of rswat model and dcn swat in the two watersheds are shown in table 5 dcn rswat achieved higher values of r2 and ns than those of other versions of rswat in both calibration and validation periods for two watersheds table 5 eic rswat performed better than hcn rswat in calibration period for both watersheds and in validation period for gw ga rswat exhibited the worst performance based on evaluation of r2 and ns in both calibration and validation periods for the two watersheds table 5 the pbias values show the rswat models tended to overestimate stream flow in calibration period while underestimate stream flow in validation period table 5 in terms of pbias values no substantial difference was observed between the four rswat models during calibration and validation these results suggest that the daily curve number method was preferable when using hourly time step richards equation based soil moisture module to simulate daily steam flow compared with dcn swat dcn rswat performed better for gw while not for tcw in validation period based on r2 ns and p bias table 5 in calibration period dcn swat performed slightly better than dcn rswat for both watersheds based on r2 and ns table 5 it was not surprising that dcn rswat did not substantially outperform dcn swat for both testing watersheds based on best simulated results this might be attributed to the fact that although soil water algorithm was improved for rswat qi et al 2018b deficiencies in other hydrological processes simulated at hourly time step might offset the improvement for example previous sensitivity analysis demonstrated that hourly groundwater module needs improvement according to model evaluation criteria provide by moriasi et al 2007 only dcn swat at tcw and dcn rswat at gw during validation had satisfactory performance i e 0 65 ns 0 5 note that those criteria were recommended for model evaluation at a monthly time step while the present study evaluated model performance at a daily time step as suggested by many studies that model simulations were poorer for shorter time steps e g daily than for longer time steps e g monthly the model performance criteria for ns should be modified appropriately for a daily time step moriasi et al 2007 in the present study we slightly lowered the criterion to be ns 0 4 which could be a reasonable criterion for satisfactory daily flow rate simulation as a result dcn swat and dcn rswat both had satisfactory model performances at the calibration and validation periods for two watersheds table 5 also eic rswat performed satisfactorily in the calibration period for gw table 5 in addition pbias values for different models at both calibration and validation periods were within either the very good or the good or the satisfactory model performance categories moriasi et al 2007 indicating that they capture well the average tendency of observed flow rates in addition we did not consider the impact of wetlands on hydrology in both watersheds for the swat and rswat models lee et al 2018 this may be the main reason for the relative poor performance of the swat and rswat models according to the criteria provide by moriasi et al 2007 interestingly all pbias values were negative during calibration overestimating flow rate while positive during validation underestimating flow rate excerpt for dcn swat at the validation period table 5 to understand causes for this discrepancy we compared annual water yield in mm generated with different models against observations as shown in fig 7 apparently all five versions of swat overestimated total water yield from 2004 to 2006 which is the major reason for the overestimation during calibration more than 1500 mm precipitation occurred in the year of 2003 and all versions of swat models were able to capture this extremely wet year on the annual scale during calibration however those models to some extent failed to estimate total water yield for the following years 2004 2006 was relatively dry compared with 2003 which had an average precipitation of about 1200 mm in both watersheds this result is consistent with many studies that reported that swat tends to overestimate steam flow for relatively dry years cheng et al 2009 mosbahi et al 2011 zettam et al 2017 our study shows that the swat model tended to underestimate stream flow for relative dry years after the extreme wet years for relative dry years before the extreme wet years or long after the extreme wet years the swat model could generally produce good results during validation all models slightly underestimated total water yield from 2011 to 2014 in both watersheds leading to positive values of pbias fig 7 table 5 notably the bias of the four rswat models was less than dcn swat for 2004 2006 in tcw during calibration and for 2011 2014 in gw during validation fig 7 the result suggests that improvement in soil moisture simulation could potentially resolve the dry year stream flow overestimation problem soil water and cn values have a nonlinear relationship as demonstrated by eqs 4 and 5 here we intended to compare daily cn and soil water values estimated by rswat based models and the swat model to examine the difference between these two types of models in predicting soil moisture and associated impacts on cn values fig 8 shows daily cn values and soil water estimated by the calibrated dcn rswat hcn rswat and dcn swat from a representative hru with a typical corn soybean rotation in tcw comparing fig 8a with 8b there is a positive relationship between the two variables with the daily cn values closely varied with daily soil water pattern for both rswat and swat models this is understandable that lower cn values indicate more infiltration and less surface runoff caused by less soil water stored in soil profile and vice versa compared with dcn swat both rswat based models estimated lower cn values and soil water than dcn swat while the difference between dcn rswat and hcn rswat was minimal for the representative hru the use of the richards equation in the two rswat based models and the bucket model in the swat model explained the difference in cn and soil water values for example the bucket model constrains water flow using definition of wilting point and field capacity while the richards equation based model regulates soil water storage and movement based on the difference in soil water potential between adjacent layers as well as hydraulic conductivity these hydraulic parameters are determined by the specific soil properties in the representative hru for other hrus in the watershed we can also expect that rswat models could generate more water storage in the soil profile than the swat model the aggregated results from all hrus determine hydrological behavior at the outlet of the watershed 3 4 baseflow evaluation model simulated vs baseflow derived from observed streamflow were shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively for tcw and gw from 2001 to 2015 table 6 summarizes the performance of different models for simulating daily baseflow during calibration and validation the model performance valuation results clearly show the dramatic differences between the baseflow simulated by different models no single model can outperform others in terms of all statistics among the five models examined here dcn swat achieved high r2 but low ns in both watersheds during calibration and validation in addition dcn swat s bias of baseflow simulation was among the largest in tcw and gw especially during calibration as shown in figs 9 and 10 despite being able to reproduce the temporal patterns of baseflow dcn swat systemically overestimated baseflow in both watersheds among the four versions of rswat models hcn rswat performed the worst in terms of bias in tcw during both calibration and validation with severe baseflow overestimation fig 9 eic rswat achieved high r2 and ns in gw but had lower r2 values in tcw during calibration and validation despite that dcn rswat did not achieved the best statistics for most cases its performance was balanced between tcw and gw and was overall acceptable according to model evaluation criteria of section 3 3 the results indicate that combing curve number method and richards equation based soil moisture module improved simulation not only on flow rate but also on baseflow at the watershed scale 3 5 discussion on model performance and applicability the present study examined and demonstrated the sensitivity of watershed modeling to different surface runoff and infiltration partition methods in the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed in northeastern us the daily curve number method generally outperformed other surface runoff and infiltration partition methods we anticipate the sensitivity of watershed modeling to surface runoff and infiltration partition methods also exists in other watersheds but the performance rank of different models may not generalize to other climatic and physiographic conditions because of distinct application conditions for different surface runoff and infiltration partition methods more studies are needed to generalize model performance over different environments here we discuss the performance of different methods and possible explanations with the aim to benefit use of them in other regions based on sensitivity analysis results we found that using rswat based models with hourly precipitation input requires more accurate estimation of soil permeability properties e g hydraulic conductivity then the swat model this is mainly because soil moisture movement through soil profile is dependent on hydraulic conductivity at an hourly step simulated with the richards question based soil moisture model nimah and hanks 1973 van genuchten 1980 thus a careful calibration of sol k is recommended when using rswat models to simulate soil water movement and stream flow the green ampt method performed the poorest in simulating daily stream flow at the two watersheds this method was developed based on several assumptions 1 homogenous soil profile 2 uniform antecedent moisture distribution and 3 saturated soil layers above the wetting front neitsch et al 2011b a successful application of green ampt method requires more detailed information about environmental conditions and spatial configuration the large heterogeneity in soil properties from surface to bottom violated these assumptions qi et al 2018b in addition the green ampt model was used to simulate infiltration excess overland flow at a point plot scale without considering saturation overland flow at a watershed scale garen and moore 2005 in contrast the curve number method tends to consider both types of stream flow generating processes which is the main reason for the better performance of dcn rswat and dcn swat models we also found that dcn rswat and dcn swat models had less prediction uncertainty and higher simulation accuracy for daily stream flow at the two study watersheds than other three rswat models both models used daily curve number method with aggregated daily precipitation instead of directly considering hourly precipitation in simulation these results indicate that simply downscaling the daily curve number method to the hourly time step is not feasible as it was originally developed based on experiments for storm events and widely used for simulations of daily stream flow at the watershed scale neitsch et al 2011b usda 1985 williams 1990 furthermore the effective infiltration capacity method tended to perform better than the hourly curve number method and green ampt method at the two study watersheds its applicability is better than the other two methods because it was derived based on experiments conducted on crop lands nearing et al 1996 however compared with the daily curve number method this empirical algorithm did not consider forested lands and many other management practices which could limit its application at watersheds with various land uses and management practices it is worth noting that dcn rswat and eic rswat significantly reduced bias for baseflow simulation compared with dcn swat at the two watersheds this could be attributed to the improved soil moisture simulation by using richards equation in swat the results in general show that experimentally based surface runoff and infiltration partition methods can provide reliable surface runoff estimation which is the main source for stream flow at the outlet of a watershed and physically based soil moisture module can provide more accurate soil water and base flow estimations for the swat model 4 conclusions the present study compared four different surface runoff and infiltration partition methods in the richards equation based swat model rswat i e daily curve number method dcn rswat hourly curve number method hcn rswat green ampt method ga rswat and effective infiltration capacity method eic rswat we applied the four versions of rswat and the daily curve number based default swat model dcn swat to simulate daily flow rate and baseflow at two watersheds draining to the chesapeake bay all models were examined with parameter sensitivity and prediction uncertainty analyses as well as calibration and validation using sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 procedure in swat cup evaluated using p factor and r factor dcn rswat in general performed the best among the four rswat based models in terms of capturing modeling uncertainty notably dcn rswat also predicted the daily flow rate with less uncertainty than dcn swat in both watersheds higher p factor and lower r factor values in terms of streamflow prediction accuracy dcn rswat performed better than other rswat models in both watersheds but did not outperform dcn swat as to baseflow simulation no single model consistently outperforms others in general dcn rswat achieved balanced acceptable performance for baseflow simulation both watersheds while the performance of other models was unbalanced either among the three accuracy assessment statistics or between the two watershed models our results clearly show the important role of surface runoff and infiltration partition methods in watershed modeling overall the combination of daily curve number method and richards equation based soil water algorithm is preferred for uncertainty characterization of predicted streamflow in the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed in northeastern us we also pointed out that compatibility between the richards equation with other hydrological components of the swat model needs further examination to further improve prediction accuracy the study points out that experimentally based surface runoff and infiltration partition methods can provide reliable surface runoff estimation and physically based soil moisture module can provide more accurate soil water and base flow estimations for the swat model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

surface runoff and infiltration partition is a primary process of hydrologic cycle here we compare four different surface runoff and infiltration partition methods within a richards equation based swat model rswat to understand their effects on watershed modeling four surface runoff and infiltration partition methods include a daily curve number method dcn rswat a hourly curve number method hcn rswat a green ampt method ga rswat and an effective infiltration capacity method eic rswat these four versions of rswat and a daily curve number based original swat dcn swat were applied to simulate daily stream flow and baseflow from 2001 to 2015 at the tuckahoe creek watershed tcw and greensboro watershed gw in maryland us the global sensitivity analysis algorithms within swat cup was used to identify sensitive parameters and the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 was used to analyze uncertainty for different models in both calibration and validation periods comparison of the results from different models highlight the sensitivity of watershed modeling to the differences between surface runoff and infiltration partition methods in general dcn rswat outperformed other versions of rswat and the standard swat model with reduced daily flow rate perdition uncertainty and improved simulation of daily baseflow in both test watersheds we anticipate the numerical experiments examined here will provide new insights into better practices in choosing surface runoff and infiltration partition methods for swat and other watershed models thereby supporting sustainable water resources assessment and management keywords sensitivity analysis calibration validation uncertainty swat cup 1 introduction how much precipitation snowmelt is divided into surface and subsurface water is critically important to watershed scale hydrological modeling einstein 1945 accurate estimation of surface and subsurface water not only determines the success of modeling the hydrograph in streams moisture distribution in soils and evapotranspiration from watersheds but also is crucial in estimating biogeochemical processes nutrient leaching and transport and plant growth sun et al 2015 xia et al 2014 surface runoff supplies the most of problems in flood control water utilization soil erosion and water quality degradation blanchoud et al 2007 louchart et al 2001 probst 1985 simard et al 2000 turtola and jaakkola 1995 chemicals applied to soil surfaces can be rapidly mobilized and transferred to streams and water bodies by surface runoff and via the movement of sediment surface runoff is often the main source of low solubility pesticide compounds to water bodies and one of the main contributors of phosphorus to aquatic ecosystems thus surface runoff plays an important role in many environmental issues such as the flooding and water contamination and eutrophication appels et al 2011 bolinder et al 2000 deasy et al 2009 van der velde et al 2009 infiltrated water is available to plants and is evaporated or transpired or percolated into ground water soil moisture controls the biogeochemical processes in soil profile and is able to significantly affect the regional atmospheric budgets of water and energy liang and xie 2001 infiltration mobilizes substances such as nitrate and soluble metabolites of pesticides leading to groundwater contamination meanwhile best management practices bmps which favor infiltration and reduce surface runoff is important for increasing water storage in soil profiles in dry regions einstein 1945 determination of surface runoff and infiltration depends on many factors such as precipitation intensity and duration infiltration properties of the soil antecedent soil moisture height of the groundwater table and topography chen et al 2014 liang and xie 2001 different models treat those processes with different strategies depending on the time step and spatial discretization and the problem the model aims to solve most of soil moisture simulation models using a small time step e g less than one minute have the capability of estimating the instantaneous hydraulic conductivity at the soil surface and infiltration can be subsequently calculated for that time step however for watershed scale models using a larger time step e g daily a lumped method is more effective to partition participation into surface runoff and infiltration the soil conservation service scs curve number cn equation is one of those methods widely used in watershed scale models ponce and hawkins 1996 another popular method for watershed scale models is the green ampt infiltration method modified for large time steps green and ampt 1911 for these one dimensional field scale models with a small time step richards equation is often employed to simulate water flow and moisture redistribution in the soil profile hutson and wagenet 1989 rojas and hanson 2000 whereas watershed scale models tend to use more simple soil water formulations such as those tipping bucket approaches kendy et al 2003 neitsch et al 2011a in a previous study qi et al 2018b a richards equation based soil moisture module was incorporated with a watershed scale model i e the soil and water assessment tool swat to simulate soil water flow and moisture distribution since the soil moisture module runs at a smaller time step i e hourly a question arose concerning how to determine the surface boundary flux i e which method should be used to determine surface runoff and infiltration at the watershed scale here we investigate different participation snowmelt partition methods within the richards equation based swat model the swat model is a watershed scale model which is designed to simulate hydrological processes and predict water quantity and quality as affected by management practices and landuse and climate change scenarios arnold et al 1998 it provides a flexible framework that allows for assessing the impact of a broad range of bmps such as cover crops filter strips conservation tillage irrigation management and terraces gassman et al 2005 li et al 2014 liu et al 2008 qi et al 2018a ullrich and volk 2009 zhang et al 2017 zhang 2018 zhang et al 2013a the swat model has been used worldwide to solve complex watershed management problems and modified for different study purposes bärlund et al 2007 fu et al 2014 krysanova and arnold 2008 qi et al 2017a qi et al 2016a qi et al 2016b qi et al 2017b qi et al 2019 srinivasan et al 2010 van griensven et al 2012 wu and liu 2012 zhang et al 2013b in swat surface runoff is simulated using either the modified cn method neitsch et al 2011a or the green ampt infiltration model green and ampt 1911 depending on the availability of daily or hourly precipitation data water infiltrated into the soil profile is redistributed using a storage routing technique a tipping bucket model narasimhan et al 2005 this simple storage routing method has been tested in several studies with results suggesting that it tended to under estimate soil water content due to its lack of accounting for water retention effects in soil profile li et al 2010 luo et al 2008 mapfumo et al 2004 qi et al 2018b has incorporated a richards equation based soil moisture module with swat and tested its performance in simulating soil moisture across 10 monitoring stations near the chesapeake bay in maryland their results indicated much improvement in soil moisture prediction compared with the original bucket model in swat the performance of the richards equation based swat hereafter referred to as rswat at the watershed scale however was not assessed yet the simulated hydrograph at the outlet of a watershed is largely determined by the method used in partitioning surface and subsurface runoff since rswat ran at a sub daily time step the original cn method and green ampt method in swat run at daily time step need to be modified to provide a sufficiently accurate surface boundary condition for richards equation based soil moisture module in addition an effective infiltration capacity method which is commonly used for richards equation applications at field scale was also used as comparison nearing et al 1996 the objectives of the present study are to 1 test four different surface runoff and infiltration partition methods in the richards equation based swat model with parameter sensitivity and prediction uncertainty analyses 2 investigate the model performance of richards equation based swat with different surface runoff and infiltration partition methods 3 compare model performance between richards equation based swat and the original swat at two watersheds in maryland us in order to compare model performance a procedure of parameter sensitivity and model uncertainty analyses and model calibration and validation using swat cup abbaspour 2013 were proposed and used here 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area and data collection we used two adjacent watersheds defined by u s geological survey usgs gate stations at the tuckahoe creak near ruthsburg usgs 01491500 and the choptank river near greensboro usgs 01491000 which are referred to as the tuckahoe creek watershed tcw 220 7 km2 and greensboro watershed gw 290 1 km2 fig 1 respectively they are located at the headwaters of the choptank river watershed crw in the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed in northeastern us fig 1 in tcw major land uses are agriculture 54 0 and forestry 32 8 in comparison gw has a higher percentage of forest 48 3 and a lower percentage of agricultural area 36 1 tcw is dominated by well drained soils 56 1 hydrologic soil group hsg a b where 69 5 of the area are under croplands lee et al 2016 whereas a large portion of soils 74 5 in gw is poorly drained hsg c d in which 67 2 of croplands are located ator and denver 2015 the major soil types found under cropland in the crw are typified by the othello soil series fine silty mixed active mesic typic endoaquults and the mattapex soil series fine silty mixed active mesic aquic hapludults othello soils are poorly drained with moderately slow permeability and mattapex soils are moderately well drained with moderate or moderately slow permeability hively et al 2009 in general the landscape in crw is nearly flat most slopes 2 the area is characterized by a temperate humid climate with an average annual temperature of 15 4 c and precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year with an average value of 1200 mm year 1 ator et al 2005 yeo et al 2014 the swat model requires detailed information on the climate soils and land use for the study site lee et al 2017 daily flow rate data for tcw and gw were downloaded from usgs gauge stations near ruthsburg usgs 01491500 and greensboro usgs 01491000 respectively a soil map was derived based on the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs soil survey geographic database ssurgo topography was delineated by resampling a 1 m light detection and ranging lidar based digital elevation model to 10 m using nearest neighbor interpolation the land use map and the scheduling of crop rotations were generated using 2008 2012 data from the usda national agriculture statistics service nass cropland data layer cdl for more information regarding swat model setup for these two watersheds please refer to lee et al 2016 hourly weather inputs for swat including precipitation temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were derived from the nasa north american land data assimilation system 2 nldas2 ldas gsfc nasa gov nldas climate forcing data nldas2 has assimilated multiple sources of climate observations and is widely recognized as a high resolution 1 8 degree spatially continuous and comprehensive dataset that is valuable for water cycling studies xia et al 2012 2 2 richards equation based swat rswat soil water moves constantly in direction of potential energy i e wet to dry soil where the gradient of potential energy with distance is the moving force causing flow soil matric potential h is defined as the work water can do as it moves from its present state to the reference state in the soil the reference state is the energy level of water at saturation h 0 this process can be described using the well known richards equation a modified richards equation zeng and decker 2009 has been incorporated in swat i e 1 θ t z k h h e z q where θ is the volumetric soil water content mm3 mm 3 t is time s z is the depth below soil surface mm positive downwards k is the hydraulic conductivity mm s 1 h is the soil matric potential mm q is a soil water sink term mm mm 1 s 1 and he is the equilibrium soil matric potential mm based on the default configuration of soil layers within swat we divided one soil layer into three sub layers which were equal in thickness and had the same physical and chemical properties of the default soil layer from which they were derived it is worth noting that the first soil layer 10 mm was not divided into three sub layers the new soil moisture module run at an hourly time step fig 2 the vertical soil moisture transport was governed by infiltration surface and lateral flow as well as transpiration through root extraction and evaporation from soil surface fig 2 free draining was assumed for the bottom boundary condition for the present study the penman monteith equation was employed to calculate evaporation transpiration we modified the existing swat dynamic storage equation to estimate hourly lateral flow neitsch et al 2011a and the existing groundwater module was also modified to simulate hourly groundwater recharge and discharge fig 2 evaporation transpiration and lateral flow were sink terms in the richards equation based soil moisture module fig 2 the instantaneous hydraulic conductivity is estimated using the method of community land model clm oleson et al 2010 the saturated conductivity is measured and provided in each hru based on usda natural resources conservation service nrcs soil survey geographic database ssurgo calculated hourly values such as surface runoff infiltration percolation between soil layers lateral flow and recharge and discharge for groundwater were aggregated at the last time step of the day and used for other swat daily processes detailed information regarding the model development and evaluation can be found in qi et al 2018b 2 3 surface runoff and infiltration calculation in the present study four methods were used to partition surface runoff and infiltration in rswat i e daily curve number method dcn rswat hourly curve number method hcn rswat green ampt method ga rswat and effective infiltration capacity method eic rswat the calculated infiltration was the surface boundary flux for the richards equation based soil moisture module all these methods can be calibrated with moisture condition ii curve number cn2 which is closely related to many bmps effects 2 3 1 daily curve number method dc daily surface runoff and infiltration were determined first based on the existing daily curve number method in swat neitsch et al 2011a given as 2 q surf r day 0 2 s 2 r day 0 8 s where qsurf is the accumulated runoff mm day 1 rday is the rainfall depth for the day mm day 1 and s is the retention parameter mm day 1 which is determined by 3 s 25 4 1000 cn 10 where cn is the daily curve number eq 3 is used to calculate daily cn by arranging its form as 4 cn 25400 s 254 and s is determined by 5 s s max 1 sw s w e x p w 1 w 2 s w where smax is the maximum value of retention on a given day mm day 1 sw is the soil water content of the entire profile and w1 and w2 are shape coefficients parameter w1 and w2 were functions of amount of water in soil profile at field capacity fc and at saturation sat mm day 1 and retention parameters mm day 1 corresponding to moisture conditions i and iii i e rmax and r3 which were calculated by eq 3 using moisture condition i and iii curve number i e cn1 and cn3 respectively moisture condition i and iii curve number were determined by moisture condition ii curve number cn2 which can be calibrated neitsch et al 2011b moisture condition i ii and iii curve number i e cn1 cn2 and cn3 representing dry average and wet antecedent soil moisture conditions respectively to calculate hourly surface boundary condition for the richards equation based soil moisture module an infiltration ratio r was given as 6 r q inf r day where q inf is the daily infiltration mm day 1 thus hourly infiltration q inf h within the day was then calculated by 7 q inf h r h r where r h is the hourly rainfall mm h 1 and hourly surface runoff q surf h mm h 1 was determined as 8 q surf h r h 1 r 2 3 2 hourly curve number method hc for the hourly curve number method hourly surface runoff is calculated by 9 q surf h r h 0 2 s h 2 r h 0 8 s h 10 s h 25 4 1000 cn h 10 where s h is the hourly retention parameter mm h 1 and cn h is the hourly curve number which is updated in each time step the formulation to calculate hourly retention parameter and curve number remained the same as that for daily curve number eqs 4 and 5 except that soil profile water content were updated hourly from richards equation then the hourly infiltration is given by 11 q inf h r h q surf h 2 3 3 green ampt method ga the existing green ampt infiltration method in swat was used to calculate hourly surface runoff instead of directly generating hourly infiltration the green ampt method provides accumulated infiltration values within a day to calculate hourly infiltration we use 12 q inf h q a c c i n f i q a c c i n f i 1 where q a c c i n f i is the accumulated infiltration mm at time step i i ranges from 1 to 24 2 3 4 effective infiltration

swat were used to simulate daily flow rate at the outlets of two study watersheds from 2001 to 2015 dcn swat serves as a benchmark for assessing model performance of the rswat based models relative to the original swat model the daily precipitation used for dcn rswat and dcn swat was derived from hourly data it is worth noting that the input for four versions of rswat models and dcn swat remained the same in order to compare performances of different versions of swat model we summarized and modified the procedure proposed in abbaspour et al 2015 the procedures for model parameter selection sensitivity and uncertainty analyses and model calibration and validation for model comparison are described as follows 1 parameter selection parameters were selected based on literature and analyst s expertise 2 sensitivity analysis the same set of selected parameters are used for all models to conduct sensitivity analysis initial ranges are assigned to parameters based on experience and hydrological knowledge of the analyst 3 uncertainty analysis all models are run with the same times e g 300 1000 times for each iteration depending on the number of parameters speed of the model execution and the system capabilities abbaspour et al 2015 after all simulations are completed for one iteration the post processing option in swat cup will suggest new parameter ranges for the next iteration abbaspour et al 2015 suggested new parameter ranges could be modifies by the user manually according to user s expertise and sensitivity analysis after each iteration here we keep the new parameter ranges unchanged most importantly total number of iterations remains the same for all models in total 3 5 iterations would be enough 4 calibration and validation after all simulations are completed for the last iteration the post processing option of swat cup calculates the objective function value and the 95ppu for all observed variables in the calibration period the final objective function value e g nash sutcliffe coefficient ns and other statistic coefficients e g coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias are also provided for the best simulation of the last iteration and a corresponding set of parameter values are determined this set of parameters were used to run models for validation periods to get the prediction for validation the 95ppu for validation period is calculated by running swat cup with the set of parameter ranges and number of simulations for the last iteration we choose the most frequently calibrated parameters for daily flow from the literature abbaspour et al 2007b arnold et al 2012 and previous studies conducted in the study watersheds lee et al 2017 lee et al 2016 five parameters were selected for sensitivity analysis to explore how these parameters were different in sensitivity for different models table 1 these parameters include moisture condition ιι curve number cn2 surface runoff lag time surlag day saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k mm h 1 baseflow recession constant alpha bf day and groundwater recharge delay days gw delay day the initial ranges of these parameters were determined based on preliminary sensitivity analysis for each model parameter sensitivities were determined using the following multiple regression equation given as 15 g α i 1 m β i b i where g is the objective function value α and βi are regression coefficients bi is the calibration parameter of the ith parameter and m is the number of parameters considered 5 in the present study nash sutcliffe coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 was used as the objective function value and student t tests were used to identify the statistical significance of each parameter this global sensitivity analysis approach is like that used in swat cup and it estimates the change in the objective function ns in the present study resulting from changes in each parameter while all other parameters are changing it has the advantage of being quite fast compared to similar procedures and it does not provide an absolute measure of the sensitivity but rather a relative sensitivity the t stat is the coefficient of a parameter divide by its standard error and it measure the precision of the regression coefficient the larger the absolute value of t stat the higher probability that the parameter is sensitive the p value was used to identify the relative sensitivity of parameters and a p value 0 05 indicated a sensitive parameter in the present study we conducted uncertainty analysis using sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 procedure in swat cup abbaspour et al 2007a the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu is the combined outcome of the uncertainties in model structure parameters and input data in sufi 2 these uncertainty sources are not separately estimated but are attributed as total model uncertainty to the parameters the p factor indicates the percentage of observed data falling within 95ppu band and the r factor is the average thickness of the 95ppu bands by the standard deviation of the observed data the r factor can vary between 0 i e achievement of a small uncertainty bound and infinity while the p factor can vary from 0 to 100 i e all observations bracketed by the predictionuncertainty singh et al 2014 the goodness of fit and the degree to which the calibrated model accounts for uncertainties are assessed by the above two measures parameters used in uncertainty analysis and their initial ranges remained the same as in sensitivity analysis table 1 uncertainty analysis was conduct for the period of 2001 2007 i e the calibration period ns was employed as the objective function because it is the most commonly used goodness of fit coefficient in hydrology modeling studies and based on ns many model performance evaluation criteria has been established by moriasi et al 2007 we implemented sufi 2 with five iterations and each iteration had 500 simulations for each version of swat model after the last iteration the finalized parameter ranges were used in swat cup to calculate 95ppu and p factor and r factor for the period of 2008 2015 i e the validation period the best simulation parameter values were also used to predict daily flow rate at the outlets of two watersheds from 2008 and 2015 the best simulation results during calibration and validation were used for model accuracy performance evaluation 2 5 baseflow calculation ideal model calibration and validation should consider a complete set of hydrological data if they are available moriasi et al 2007 since very few watersheds have differentially monitored baseflow and surface runoff data separating baseflow and surface runoff from measured total streamflow is often conducted to evaluate model performance on water balance in the present study we used the ecohydrology package in r program to calculate daily baseflow from daily streamflow at the outlets of tcw and gw the package is based on the widely used baseflow and surface separation method provided by nathan and mcmahon 1990 the package needs two parameters to calculate baseflow i e filter parameter and passes and they were set as 0 925 and 3 in the present study respectively as discussed in https cran r project org web packages ecohydrology ecohydrology pdf 2 6 model performance evaluation for reliable model evaluation a combination of different efficiency criteria complemented by the assessment of the absolute or relative error is recommended krause et al 2005 performance of four versions of rswat and dcn swat on daily flow rate simulation was assessed using three well known statistical criteria i e pbias r2 and ns given as 16 p bias 100 o avg p avg o avg 17 ns 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o avg 2 18 r 2 i 1 n o i o avg p i p avg i 1 n o i o avg 2 i 1 n p i p avg 2 0 5 2 where oi and pi are the observed and predicted values oavg and pavg are the average of the observed and predicted values the r2 ranges from 0 to 1 and explains the proportion of variance in observed data with higher values indicating less error variance the ns is a normalized statistic and estimates the relative magnitude of the residual variance as compared to the observed nash and sutcliffe 1970 and demonstrates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line and pbias has the ability to indicate poor model performance and measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than observed data low values of pbias indicate accurate model simulation positive values indicate model underestimation bias and negative values indicate model overestimation bias gupta et al 1999 the three statistical criteria were also used to evaluate model performance on daily baseflow simulation from 2001 to 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameter sensitivity analysis parameter sensitivity was measured by t stat and p value based on student t tests and the results are summarized in table 2 as expected moisture condition ιι curve number cn2 was sensitive for most models p value 0 05 except for ga rswat in both watersheds and hcn rswat in gw saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k was not sensitive for dcn rswat and dcn swat and both groundwater parameters i e baseflow recession constant day alpha bf and groundwater recharge delay days day gw delay were not sensitive for the four versions of rswat in the two watersheds table 2 sol k was the commonly sensitive parameter for three versions of rswat may be due to the fact that their surface runoff and infiltration partition algorithms use hourly participation while dcn rswat and dcn swat only considered daily precipitation aggregated from hourly input in addition since sensitivity of one parameter is often dependent on the values of other parameters abbaspour et al 2017 sol k became so influential in hourly time step model that the influence of cn2 in the multi variate regression equation eq 15 might be reduced for ga rswat in both watersheds and for hcn rswat in gw besides the increasing influence of sol k as stated above groundwater parameters i e alpha bf and gw delay became less sensitive for the rswat models because the movement of soil water was restricted by richards equation based module qi et al 2018b as a result the linkage between soil water and groundwater dynamics were weaker compared the original algorithm of swat this result suggests that a better groundwater module is needed to better predict groundwater discharge responding to restricted recharge from soil profile when richards equation based soil water module is used note that t stat for cn2 surlag and alpha bf was negative and t stat for gw delay was positive for all five models in tcw and gw this means that in order to increase the value of objective function ns values of cn2 surlag and alpha bf should be reduced and values of gw delay should be increased for all five models in addition sol k had positive t stat for the four rswat models while t stat of sol k was negative for dcn swat in both watersheds table 2 it seems that increasing sol k tended to increase ns for the rswat models while reduce ns for dcn swat however if the corresponding p value of a t stat is 0 05 positive negative signs of t stat is not significant that is we can only draw conclusion on parameters with p value 0 05 for example we can conclude that reducing cn2 could increase ns for dcn rswat hcn rswat eic rswat and dcn swat but probably not for ga rswat table 2 3 2 model uncertainty analysis the 95ppu for the four versions of rswat and dcn swat with the daily observed and best simulated flow rate for the calibration and validation periods in tcw and gw are illustrated in figs 3 6 respectively the shaded area 95ppu include all uncertainties which is quantified by p factor and r factor table 3 p factor 0 7 and r factor around 1 indicates a model had acceptable prediction uncertainty abbaspour 2013 in the present study we extended the upper limit of r factor to 1 2 which could be a reasonable estimation for our study results dcn rswat had the greatest p factor 0 86 for tcw and gw and ga rswat had the lowest p factor 0 66 and 0 46 for tcw and gw respectively in the calibration period among the four versions of rswat for both watersheds table 3 hcn rswat attained equal p factor to that of eic rswat for tcw while eic rswat achieved larger p factor than that of hcn rswat for gw table 3 the r factor based assessment is different from that using p factor for example in calibration period eic rswat had the greatest r factor 1 76 and 1 57 for tcw and gw respectively and ga rswat had the lowest r factor 0 69 and 0 53 for tcw and gw respectively among four versions of rswat and for both watersheds table 3 overall the percentage of observed flow rate bracketed by the 95ppu of dcn rswat was higher than those of hcn rswat ga rswat and eic rswat figs 3 6 ga rswat achieved a narrower prediction interval than those of other rswat models figs 3 6 the r factor and p factor assessment results in calibration in general translate into the validation period except that eic rswat attained less p factor than dcn rswat in calibration but higher in validation period table 3 based on the statistics in table 3 there is a clear trade off between p factor and r factor for model uncertainty evaluation a larger p factor can be achieved at the expense of a larger r factor while a smaller r factor often accompanies a smaller p factor a model with a balance between the two factors can provide acceptable prediction uncertainty based on the criteria for acceptable prediction uncertainty i e p factor 0 7 and r factor 1 2 for the present study hcn rswat for tcw and dcn rswat for gw were acceptable models in the calibration period table 3 in the validation period hcn rswat and dcn rswat for tcw and dcn rswat and eic rswat for gw were acceptable models table 3 in total among the four rswat based models dcn rswat was the model achieving acceptable performance for most cases for the two watersheds compared with dcn swat dcn rswat had higher p factor 0 86 vs 0 82 in tcw and 0 86 vs 0 79 in gw respectively and lower r factor 1 39 vs 1 55 in tcw and 1 13 vs 1 18 in gw respectively in the calibration period table 3 the same pattern was observed in the validation period table 3 apparently dcn rswat better represent uncertainties than dcn swat for daily flow rate more which is likely due to a more physical representation of soil water flow by richards equation 3 3 model accuracy evaluation the calibrated parameters generating the best simulation of the last iteration during uncertainty analysis are shown in table 4 statistical indices of model performance in calibration and validation periods for four versions of rswat model and dcn swat in the two watersheds are shown in table 5 dcn rswat achieved higher values of r2 and ns than those of other versions of rswat in both calibration and validation periods for two watersheds table 5 eic rswat performed better than hcn rswat in calibration period for both watersheds and in validation period for gw ga rswat exhibited the worst performance based on evaluation of r2 and ns in both calibration and validation periods for the two watersheds table 5 the pbias values show the rswat models tended to overestimate stream flow in calibration period while underestimate stream flow in validation period table 5 in terms of pbias values no substantial difference was observed between the four rswat models during calibration and validation these results suggest that the daily curve number method was preferable when using hourly time step richards equation based soil moisture module to simulate daily steam flow compared with dcn swat dcn rswat performed better for gw while not for tcw in validation period based on r2 ns and p bias table 5 in calibration period dcn swat performed slightly better than dcn rswat for both watersheds based on r2 and ns table 5 it was not surprising that dcn rswat did not substantially outperform dcn swat for both testing watersheds based on best simulated results this might be attributed to the fact that although soil water algorithm was improved for rswat qi et al 2018b deficiencies in other hydrological processes simulated at hourly time step might offset the improvement for example previous sensitivity analysis demonstrated that hourly groundwater module needs improvement according to model evaluation criteria provide by moriasi et al 2007 only dcn swat at tcw and dcn rswat at gw during validation had satisfactory performance i e 0 65 ns 0 5 note that those criteria were recommended for model evaluation at a monthly time step while the present study evaluated model performance at a daily time step as suggested by many studies that model simulations were poorer for shorter time steps e g daily than for longer time steps e g monthly the model performance criteria for ns should be modified appropriately for a daily time step moriasi et al 2007 in the present study we slightly lowered the criterion to be ns 0 4 which could be a reasonable criterion for satisfactory daily flow rate simulation as a result dcn swat and dcn rswat both had satisfactory model performances at the calibration and validation periods for two watersheds table 5 also eic rswat performed satisfactorily in the calibration period for gw table 5 in addition pbias values for different models at both calibration and validation periods were within either the very good or the good or the satisfactory model performance categories moriasi et al 2007 indicating that they capture well the average tendency of observed flow rates in addition we did not consider the impact of wetlands on hydrology in both watersheds for the swat and rswat models lee et al 2018 this may be the main reason for the relative poor performance of the swat and rswat models according to the criteria provide by moriasi et al 2007 interestingly all pbias values were negative during calibration overestimating flow rate while positive during validation underestimating flow rate excerpt for dcn swat at the validation period table 5 to understand causes for this discrepancy we compared annual water yield in mm generated with different models against observations as shown in fig 7 apparently all five versions of swat overestimated total water yield from 2004 to 2006 which is the major reason for the overestimation during calibration more than 1500 mm precipitation occurred in the year of 2003 and all versions of swat models were able to capture this extremely wet year on the annual scale during calibration however those models to some extent failed to estimate total water yield for the following years 2004 2006 was relatively dry compared with 2003 which had an average precipitation of about 1200 mm in both watersheds this result is consistent with many studies that reported that swat tends to overestimate steam flow for relatively dry years cheng et al 2009 mosbahi et al 2011 zettam et al 2017 our study shows that the swat model tended to underestimate stream flow for relative dry years after the extreme wet years for relative dry years before the extreme wet years or long after the extreme wet years the swat model could generally produce good results during validation all models slightly underestimated total water yield from 2011 to 2014 in both watersheds leading to positive values of pbias fig 7 table 5 notably the bias of the four rswat models was less than dcn swat for 2004 2006 in tcw during calibration and for 2011 2014 in gw during validation fig 7 the result suggests that improvement in soil moisture simulation could potentially resolve the dry year stream flow overestimation problem soil water and cn values have a nonlinear relationship as demonstrated by eqs 4 and 5 here we intended to compare daily cn and soil water values estimated by rswat based models and the swat model to examine the difference between these two types of models in predicting soil moisture and associated impacts on cn values fig 8 shows daily cn values and soil water estimated by the calibrated dcn rswat hcn rswat and dcn swat from a representative hru with a typical corn soybean rotation in tcw comparing fig 8a with 8b there is a positive relationship between the two variables with the daily cn values closely varied with daily soil water pattern for both rswat and swat models this is understandable that lower cn values indicate more infiltration and less surface runoff caused by less soil water stored in soil profile and vice versa compared with dcn swat both rswat based models estimated lower cn values and soil water than dcn swat while the difference between dcn rswat and hcn rswat was minimal for the representative hru the use of the richards equation in the two rswat based models and the bucket model in the swat model explained the difference in cn and soil water values for example the bucket model constrains water flow using definition of wilting point and field capacity while the richards equation based model regulates soil water storage and movement based on the difference in soil water potential between adjacent layers as well as hydraulic conductivity these hydraulic parameters are determined by the specific soil properties in the representative hru for other hrus in the watershed we can also expect that rswat models could generate more water storage in the soil profile than the swat model the aggregated results from all hrus determine hydrological behavior at the outlet of the watershed 3 4 baseflow evaluation model simulated vs baseflow derived from observed streamflow were shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively for tcw and gw from 2001 to 2015 table 6 summarizes the performance of different models for simulating daily baseflow during calibration and validation the model performance valuation results clearly show the dramatic differences between the baseflow simulated by different models no single model can outperform others in terms of all statistics among the five models examined here dcn swat achieved high r2 but low ns in both watersheds during calibration and validation in addition dcn swat s bias of baseflow simulation was among the largest in tcw and gw especially during calibration as shown in figs 9 and 10 despite being able to reproduce the temporal patterns of baseflow dcn swat systemically overestimated baseflow in both watersheds among the four versions of rswat models hcn rswat performed the worst in terms of bias in tcw during both calibration and validation with severe baseflow overestimation fig 9 eic rswat achieved high r2 and ns in gw but had lower r2 values in tcw during calibration and validation despite that dcn rswat did not achieved the best statistics for most cases its performance was balanced between tcw and gw and was overall acceptable according to model evaluation criteria of section 3 3 the results indicate that combing curve number method and richards equation based soil moisture module improved simulation not only on flow rate but also on baseflow at the watershed scale 3 5 discussion on model performance and applicability the present study examined and demonstrated the sensitivity of watershed modeling to different surface runoff and infiltration partition methods in the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed in northeastern us the daily curve number method generally outperformed other surface runoff and infiltration partition methods we anticipate the sensitivity of watershed modeling to surface runoff and infiltration partition methods also exists in other watersheds but the performance rank of different models may not generalize to other climatic and physiographic conditions because of distinct application conditions for different surface runoff and infiltration partition methods more studies are needed to generalize model performance over different environments here we discuss the performance of different methods and possible explanations with the aim to benefit use of them in other regions based on sensitivity analysis results we found that using rswat based models with hourly precipitation input requires more accurate estimation of soil permeability properties e g hydraulic conductivity then the swat model this is mainly because soil moisture movement through soil profile is dependent on hydraulic conductivity at an hourly step simulated with the richards question based soil moisture model nimah and hanks 1973 van genuchten 1980 thus a careful calibration of sol k is recommended when using rswat models to simulate soil water movement and stream flow the green ampt method performed the poorest in simulating daily stream flow at the two watersheds this method was developed based on several assumptions 1 homogenous soil profile 2 uniform antecedent moisture distribution and 3 saturated soil layers above the wetting front neitsch et al 2011b a successful application of green ampt method requires more detailed information about environmental conditions and spatial configuration the large heterogeneity in soil properties from surface to bottom violated these assumptions qi et al 2018b in addition the green ampt model was used to simulate infiltration excess overland flow at a point plot scale without considering saturation overland flow at a watershed scale garen and moore 2005 in contrast the curve number method tends to consider both types of stream flow generating processes which is the main reason for the better performance of dcn rswat and dcn swat models we also found that dcn rswat and dcn swat models had less prediction uncertainty and higher simulation accuracy for daily stream flow at the two study watersheds than other three rswat models both models used daily curve number method with aggregated daily precipitation instead of directly considering hourly precipitation in simulation these results indicate that simply downscaling the daily curve number method to the hourly time step is not feasible as it was originally developed based on experiments for storm events and widely used for simulations of daily stream flow at the watershed scale neitsch et al 2011b usda 1985 williams 1990 furthermore the effective infiltration capacity method tended to perform better than the hourly curve number method and green ampt method at the two study watersheds its applicability is better than the other two methods because it was derived based on experiments conducted on crop lands nearing et al 1996 however compared with the daily curve number method this empirical algorithm did not consider forested lands and many other management practices which could limit its application at watersheds with various land uses and management practices it is worth noting that dcn rswat and eic rswat significantly reduced bias for baseflow simulation compared with dcn swat at the two watersheds this could be attributed to the improved soil moisture simulation by using richards equation in swat the results in general show that experimentally based surface runoff and infiltration partition methods can provide reliable surface runoff estimation which is the main source for stream flow at the outlet of a watershed and physically based soil moisture module can provide more accurate soil water and base flow estimations for the swat model 4 conclusions the present study compared four different surface runoff and infiltration partition methods in the richards equation based swat model rswat i e daily curve number method dcn rswat hourly curve number method hcn rswat green ampt method ga rswat and effective infiltration capacity method eic rswat we applied the four versions of rswat and the daily curve number based default swat model dcn swat to simulate daily flow rate and baseflow at two watersheds draining to the chesapeake bay all models were examined with parameter sensitivity and prediction uncertainty analyses as well as calibration and validation using sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 procedure in swat cup evaluated using p factor and r factor dcn rswat in general performed the best among the four rswat based models in terms of capturing modeling uncertainty notably dcn rswat also predicted the daily flow rate with less uncertainty than dcn swat in both watersheds higher p factor and lower r factor values in terms of streamflow prediction accuracy dcn rswat performed better than other rswat models in both watersheds but did not outperform dcn swat as to baseflow simulation no single model consistently outperforms others in general dcn rswat achieved balanced acceptable performance for baseflow simulation both watersheds while the performance of other models was unbalanced either among the three accuracy assessment statistics or between the two watershed models our results clearly show the important role of surface runoff and infiltration partition methods in watershed modeling overall the combination of daily curve number method and richards equation based soil water algorithm is preferred for uncertainty characterization of predicted streamflow in the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed in northeastern us we also pointed out that compatibility between the richards equation with other hydrological components of the swat model needs further examination to further improve prediction accuracy the study points out that experimentally based surface runoff and infiltration partition methods can provide reliable surface runoff estimation and physically based soil moisture module can provide more accurate soil water and base flow estimations for the swat model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

5913,chalk groundwater is an important aquifer resource it is intensively exploited for human use with a large proportion utilized for drinking water the improvement of the knowledge on chalk aquifer hydrogeological functioning is essential for the management of this resource here we developed a methodology based on a combination of hydrodynamic hydrochemistry and groundwater dating tools a study site with chalk outcrops was selected in ne france where groundwater geochemistry and water level were monitored continuously for 2 years from 2017 to 2019 and groundwater residence time was estimated using cfcs and sf6 overall the aquifer has an inertial behaviour with respect to recharge nevertheless a rapid water level response following rainfall events was observed at one site suggesting the presence of highly developed fracture network at the local scale according to the mixing process piston flow exponential or binary mixing defined at each sampling site groundwater dating indicated rather heterogeneous ages ranging from modern to about 50 years high spatial and temporal heterogeneities were observed and interpreted by a combination of hydrogeological setting residence time and land use information highlighting main factors governing the chalk groundwater geochemistry including water level fluctuation thickness of the unsaturated zone uz superficial formations distribution

paris basin the london basin denmark and the north west of germany bakalowicz 2018 groundwater of the chalk aquifer is intensively exploited for human use making it one of the most important aquifers over much of northern europe in france the chalk aquifer covers about 20 of the metropolitan territory with a total area of 110 000 km2 crampon et al 1996 roux 2018 and provides approximately 12

chlorofluorocarbons and sf6 sulphur hexafluoride could be used e g aeschbach hertig et al 1999 busenberg and plummer 1992 cook and solomon 1995 dunkle et al 1993 plummer et al 2001 vergnaud ayraud et al 2008 an average age and a distribution of residence times of groundwater can be estimated considering various mixing models the most commonly used are the piston flow the binary or exponential mixing providing information on aquifer functioning appelo and postma 2004 cook et al 2005 małoszewski and zuber 1982 to date only a few studies have been undertaken using cfcs and or sf6 to understand groundwater flow in chalk aquifers cary et al 2014 darling et al 2012b 2005 gooddy et al 2006 furthermore no studies have combined geological characterization hydrodynamic conditions water level fluctuations and recharge process residence time determination and groundwater geochemistry within a chalk aquifer a methodology that combines these different approaches could provide a comprehensive understanding of the chalk aquifer functioning indeed spatial and temporal heterogeneities of hydrogeological and geochemical properties could exist resulting in a complex aquifer system even on a small scale the aim of this work is to establish a conceptual model of the unconfined chalk aquifer on a water catchment scale in terms of groundwater flow paths mixings and geochemistry for a better understanding of the hydrogeological functioning of the aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area is located at the east of the city of reims in the champagne region ne of france fig 1 and covers approximately 500 km2 between the suippe river as the northern and western boundary and the vesle river as the southern boundary both the two rivers have several tributaries the prosne river tributary of the vesle river is dry for most of the time while others are permanent watercourses fig 1 the cretaceous formations outcropping on the surface of the study area are constituted by coniacian c3 santonian c4 and campanian c5 chalks fig 1 despite the different age of formation the three chalks present a similar lithology the first 10 20 m of the champagne chalk are significantly fractured and the fracturing decreases with depth mangeret et al 2012 vachier et al 1987 the chalk formation is partially covered by tertiary formations 10 50 m laurain et al 1981 at the berru mount and by quaternary formations including graveluche colluvium and alluvium fig 1 graveluche also called grèze refers to a periglacial formation with a maximum thickness of 6 10 m rouxel david et al 2002b during the quaternary the long period of freeze thaw alternation produced movement in the terrain graveluches resulting from this gelification process of the chalk are very variable in particle size and composition with more or less content on clay and silt vernhet 2007 the graveluche formation is more widely spread in the north the catchment area of the suippe river than in the south of the study area colluvium is present mainly in dry valleys with a thickness of about 1 3 m they have substantially the same composition as the soils from which they formed but a higher silt and clay content alluvium deposits are located in river valleys composed mainly by sand clay and gravel vernhet 2007 their thickness could reach about 10 m in maximum with locally accumulated clay layers up to 5 m rouxel david et al 2002b the unconfined champagne chalk aquifer is a crucial water resource of the region it is the only resource used for drinking water and is also largely exploited for agricultural and industrial uses the total porosity of the chalk is about 40 crampon et al 1993 with only 1 related to the effective porosity vachier et al 1987 the champagne mounts constitute the main reliefs where the transmissivity ranges from 10 6 m2 s 1 to 10 5 m2 s 1 whereas in the valleys these values are much higher ranging from 10 2 m2 s 1 to 0 3 m2 s 1 rouxel david et al 2002b the study area is divided into two parts by the groundwater divide line across the summit of berru mount and the champagne mounts which delimits the vesle river watershed in the south and the suippe river watershed in the north according to water levels the chalk aquifer of the study area is generally drained by rivers rouxel david et al 2002a fig 1 the precipitation constitutes the only recharge of the champagne chalk aquifer the climate of the region is temperate oceanic with an average temperature of 11 2 c and average annual precipitation of 566 mm values from meteofrance for 2012 2018 period at reims prunay station fig 1 the annual effective rainfall ranges generally from 100 to 150 mm mainly in winter spring with the rest of the total precipitation being taken by evapotranspiration baran et al 2006 land use of the study area can be divided into three major types 1 agricultural this type occupies the majority of the study area with the main crops of wheat barley sugar beet and alfalfa laurain et al 1981 2 forest this is the second major type of land use which covers in particular the berru and champagne mounts representing about 15 of the surface of the study area 3 anthropogenic this category mainly includes cities and villages and represents about only 3 of the area of the sector with a landfill situated in middle of the study area fig 1 2 2 sampling and analytical methods water samples were collected monthly from june 2017 to june 2019 at 15 sampling points fig 1 including 10 boreholes 2 pumping stations used for drinking water supply and 3 points in rivers in order to take into account the groundwater surface water exchanges the sampling points are well distributed in the study area allowing different geological contexts to be observed properties of sampling points are presented in table 1 in situ video inspection was done to examine the condition of boreholes no abnormalities such as deterioration or cracks were found except for fbn5 inside the borehole fbn5 the casing set inside the borehole consists of a successive of short pvc pipes however these pvc pipes are not well connected and gaps between every two pipes were observed allowing rainwater to seep into the borehole groundwater levels were measured monthly from december 2017 the water level and temperature were recorded hourly in the 9 non exploited boreholes using pressure sensors in situ rugged troll 100 water level logger table 1 in addition a ctd diver water logger schlumberger water services was installed in the borehole fap to monitor hourly electrical conductivity ec as the water level here reacted much faster than the other boreholes following rainfall events in situ parameters were measured monthly at each site temperature ph and ec were measured using a wtw 3320 ph meter and a wtw 3320 conductivity meter alkalinity was determined using a hach digital titrimeter water samples for analysis of major ions ca2 mg2 na k no3 so4 2 cl were collected in two 50 ml polyethylene bottles after filtration through 0 45 µm membranes and the samples for cation analyses were acidified with hno3 the samples were then stored at 4 c before analysis two sampling campaigns for groundwater dating using cfcs and sf6 were carried out in may 2018 high water level and october 2018 low water level waters for cfcs and sf6 analysis were collected in stainless steel ampoules after washing through at least three volumes of the ampoule without any atmospheric contact during sampling waters for noble gases analysis were sampled in 500 ml glass flasks the bottles were submerged in flowing water flushed and capped without headspace to avoid air bubbles analyses of major cations and anions were done by icp optical emission spectrometry icap 6300 thermo and ion chromatography system dionex ics 2000 respectively cfcs and sf6 concentrations in water samples were measured by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector after pre concentration by a purge and trap method described by aquilina et al 2006 and vergnaud ayraud et al 2008 the analytical uncertainty is about 1 3 for cfcs and 5 for sf6 noble gases ar ne were measured using a micro gas chromatograph gc 3000 sra instruments with an uncertainty of about 3 for ne and less than 2 for ar aquilina et al 2006 2 3 estimation of recharge temperature excess air and apparent age the concentrations of noble gases were used to estimate recharge temperature and excess air contribution busenberg and plummer 1992 heaton and vogel 1981 the estimation of the recharge temperature defined as the temperature in the uz above the water table where air water equilibrium is carried out dunkle et al 1993 is essential for determining the solubility of cfcs and sf6 in henry s law excess air refers to dissolution of air bubbles trapped by infiltrating water in the uz heaton and vogel 1981 it is used to correct sf6 data which could be greatly influenced by this parameter in contrast to cfcs ayraud et al 2008 plummer et al 2001 vittecoq et al 2007 the measured cfcs and sf6 concentrations in water samples in pmol l 1 were converted to atmospheric partial pressures in pptv according to the estimated recharge temperature and then compared to the atmospheric evolution curve available on usgs web site https water usgs gov lab software air curve index html to determine the apparent age groundwater is usually a contribution of water from different flow pathways according to aquifer properties as a result conceptual mixing models have to be used to interpret cfcs and sf6 concentration as groundwater apparent ages three models are used in this study for the calculation of apparent ages piston flow model pfm exponential mixing model emm and binary mixing model bmm the piston flow model assumes that a tracer travels from the inlet position recharge area to the outlet position e g a well or spring without any dispersion or mixing jurgens et al 2012 etcheverry 2002 małoszewski and zuber 1982 the exponential mixing model describes an exponential distribution of transit times with a transit time of zero for the shortest flow line and a transit time of infinity for the longest line it is applicable for unconfined aquifers of constant thickness with uniform areal recharge cook et al 2006 the apparent age calculated from emm are expressed by the mean residence time mrt which corresponds to the transit time that is longer than that of 2 3 of the flow lines binary mixing model considers a mixing of young and old water masses which represents the simplest mixing process the proportion of the two components and the apparent age of one of the two components can be calculated this model can be appropriate for aquifers with short circuit pathways karstic aquifers or watershed with transmissivity contrasts jurgens et al 2012 katz et al 2009 michel 2004 3 results 3 1 groundwater level fluctuation chalk groundwater level showed seasonal variations fig 2 the highest water level was reached in march april following the winter spring recharge due to excess of rainfall compared to evapotranspiration then the water level declined due to evapotranspiration excess and drainage by rivers it reached the lowest level in october november fig 2 annual variations were also observed the water level in march april 2018 was much higher than that of the same period in 2017 and 2019 as the winter of 2017 and the spring of 2018 were extremely wet with intensive precipitation the water level during high water season of 2018 was the highest since the last ten years as demonstrated by piezometric chronicles of two boreholes in chalk aquifer near the study area monitored since 2008 ades database 2019 si 1 seasonal water level fluctuations were highly variable on the study area table 2 the changes in water level between high and low water conditions in 2018 were down to 5 m near river valley fap but could reach up to 15 m on interfluve fbn1 fbn4 and fbn5 with the thickness of uz varying from 2 m fap to 26 m fbn1 table 2 the rise of water level was not simultaneous in different boreholes fig 2 in 2018 4 boreholes fbn4 fep1 fp1 and fap reached their maximum levels in april 4 boreholes fa fbn5 fvdv and fpm3 reached their maximum levels in march and 1 borehole fbn1 reached its maximum level in february moreover the rise of water level during recharge period was more rapid than the decline of water level during discharge period this asymmetry was less obvious for boreholes near river valleys fap fp1 fig 2 the chalk aquifer exhibits a very inertial behavior whereby the temporal variation curves of groundwater levels are smooth with rather gentle slopes except for fbn1 fbn5 and fap fig 2 at fbn1 and fbn5 rapid drawdown was observed following pumping for water sampling during low water period fig 2 large fluctuations in water levels were also observed during high water level period probably related to nearby groundwater exploitation for industrial and agricultural purposes in addition at fbn5 rapid increases in water level were observed following rainfall events particularly during high water level period in 2018 this could be explained by a direct infiltration of rainwater into the borehole due to bad conditions of the casing as reported by video observations during period of high soil moisture and intensive precipitation at fap water level also rapidly increased following the rainfall events figs 2 and 3 but with a low range several decimeters it increased about 1 h after the rainfall and reaches a maximum value after 4 h then it stabilizes gradually to its pre disturbance level in the following tens of hours fig 3 the evolution of groundwater temperature and ec in this borehole follow the same pattern fig 3 the video observations show that the tube is in good condition a direct intrusion of rainwater into this borehole is unlikely 3 2 chalk groundwater geochemistry the chemical composition of the monitored groundwater is typical of the chalk groundwater with ca2 and hco3 being the dominant ions table 3 however significant spatial and temporal variations in groundwater geochemistry were observed as shown by the variability of major ions concentrations and ec values average concentrations of ca2 and hco3 at each sampling site ranged from 4 04 to 7 18 meq l 1 and from 3 01 to 4 79 meq l 1 respectively for cl and no3 ions the average concentrations at each site ranged from 0 21 to 1 49 meq l 1 and from 0 31 to 0 88 meq l 1 respectively concentrations of mg2 na k and so4 2 were also variable but much lower than those of other ions table 3 temporal variations in concentrations were different for each major ion from one site to another due to the high variability of the major ions concentrations the mean values of ec at each site varied widely from 410 to 770 µs cm 1 water samples collected at fbn4 were the most mineralized with the highest conductivity and high concentrations of almost all major ions water samples collected at fpm1 and fpm3 were the least mineralized with the lowest values of ec and low concentrations of major ions the ph values of the groundwater samples were relatively homogeneous with average values at each sampling site ranging from 7 07 to 7 48 table 3 surface water samples had the same ca2 hco3 chemical facies as groundwater samples as river water in the study area comes mainly from drainage of the chalk aquifer the ph values 7 94 8 07 were higher than those measured in groundwater 7 07 7 48 the ec mean values at each site ranged from 488 to 517 µs cm 1 with relatively low spatial and temporal variabilities 3 3 groundwater dating by cfcs and sf6 3 3 1 recharge temperature and excess air in groundwater samples ne and ar concentrations ranged from 0 84 10 8 to 1 69 10 8 mol l 1 and 1 71 10 5 to 2 18 10 5 mol l 1 respectively table 4 the recharge temperature and excess air were estimated from the relationship between ar and ne si 2 in may 2018 the estimated recharge temperature was similar in all waters of the study area with an average value of 10 c no recharge temperature information can be estimated at fbn4 due to a high value of excess air in october 2018 the recharge temperature showed a spatial variability with values ranging from 10 and 16 c with an average value of 13 c higher than that in may this is consistent with several months winter recharge with relatively low temperatures making the estimated recharge temperature in water samples in may lower than in october when samples were collected at the low water level with very few recharge in summer the estimated excess air in samples ranged from 0 to more than 8 ml l 1 with an average value of about 3 4 2 ml l 1 no significant difference in excess air values was observed between the two sampling campaigns at fpm1 negative excess air value was observed which could probably due to the absorption by rubber tubes present at this borehole the highest values of excess air were observed in water samples at fp1 fa pp and fbn4 with the maximum value 8 ml l 1 for water sample collected at fbn4 in may 2018 3 3 2 groundwater apparent ages the measured cfcs and sf6 concentrations in water samples in pmol l 1 were transferred to atmospheric partial pressures in pptv according to henry s law the data was rejected when calculated concentrations were greater than atmospheric peak concentrations marked as contamination table 4 a frequent contamination of tracer gases was observed on the study area especially for cfc 12 commonly recognized sources of cfcs contamination include seepage from septic tanks landfills kjeldsen and christophersen 2001 release from polyurethane foam waste kjeldsen and jensen 2001 leaky sewer lines leakage from underground storage tanks infiltration or disposal of industrial wastes and recharge from rivers contaminated with cfcs cook et al 2006 cfcs contamination could also result from agricultural activities agricultural application of pesticides may introduce cfcs particularly cfc 11 to unsaturated air as cfcs are allowed as inert ingredients in pesticide formulations plummer et al 2000 in addition cfcs can sorb into rubber and polymers therefore water samples can also be contaminated with cfcs from contact with these materials such as permanently installed submersible pumps in wells with rubber parts cook et al 2006 dunkle et al 1993 although most sf6 concentrations did not exceed atmospheric peak concentrations apparent ages estimated by sf6 were generally much younger than all the other tracers suggesting some anthropogenic and or natural addition of sf6 anthropogenic sources of sf6 include high voltage electricity supply equipment mg and al melting and landfills darling et al 2012a santella et al 2008 unlike cfcs which come exclusively from anthropogenic sources sf6 can also be present naturally in rocks the major known source of terrigenous sf6 is found in fluorite and granite however significant concentrations of sf6 is also reported in other mineral and rock types such as hydrothermal mineral deposits halite and dolomite busenberg and plummer 2000 harnisch and eisenhauer 1998 the natural presence of sf6 in chalk cannot be excluded as dolomite is commonly present in chalk as impurity barhoum et al 2014 gillon et al 2010 the studied aquifer is unconfined with fractures making the soil and groundwater very vulnerable to contamination the landfill site in middle of the study area fig 1 appears to be a major source of contamination of cfcs and sf6 a small waste deposit site located near the borehole fbn1 fig 1 could also represent a local source of pollution furthermore since the majority of the study area is used as farmland the agricultural application of pesticides could also be a potential source of contamination for cfcs especially cfc 11 plummer et al 2000 it should be noted that water samples collected at fpm1 were contaminated by all the 4 trace gases indeed fpm1 is a private well in a farm where a permanently pumping system is installed water samples were collected directly from the tap air contact with the pumped water may occur between the pump and the tap rubber water tubes connected with the tap could also present a potential source of contamination as a result of frequent contamination some water samples are not datable fbn5 fpm1 and fpm3 as only one or two tracers are valid for calculation and estimated ages are not consistent for different tracer gases cross plots of concentrations for cfc 11 vs cfc 113 and sf6 vs cfc 113 super imposed on the mixing models have been realized si 3 cfc 12 is not used for cross plot due to its frequent contamination also not all water samples were plotted as some of them were concerned by contamination of related tracers with concentrations surpassing the range of axis the plot position of sampling points compared to pfm emm and bmm curves allowed to provide information for the selection of models also the consistency of apparent ages between different tracer gases and between the two sampling campaigns is used for the validation of models when different tracers did not give consistent apparent ages values estimated by cfc 11 and cfc 113 were considered to be more reliable than cfc 12 and sf6 as the latter two tracers were largely influenced by anthropogenic activities on the study area the selected mixing models and estimated residence time are resumed in table 4 groundwater residence time of the study area is rather heterogeneous ranging from modern to about 50 years this result is comparable with previously published data on the champagne mount area with an average residence time of about 25 years mangeret et al 2012 the piston flow model is more suitable for fep1 and pp 30 40 years the exponential mixing model is the best model for fbn1 fbn4 and fp1 mrt from 18 to 40 years the binary mixing model is more suitable for fa fap fvdv and pdo 25 to 80 of modern water and an end member of old water ranging from 30 to more than 50 years residence times estimated by piston flow and exponential mixing model at each point were similar between the sampling campaign of may 2018 high water and october 2018 low water for boreholes applying the binary mixing model significant differences of residence time were observed between the two sampling campaigns at fa fap and fvdv estimated apparent ages for samples collected in may are younger than in october with higher proportions of modern water or younger ages of the old end member at pdo apparent ages for samples collected in may are older than in october with less proportions of modern water age 10 years table 4 4 discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic characteristics the unconfined chalk aquifer of the study area possesses highly heterogeneous hydrological characteristics a higher variation in water levels was observed on interfluves than in river valleys fig 2 attesting differences in transmissivity and storage yield in river valleys high density of active fractures are consistently developed resulting in high permeability of the aquifer haria et al 2003 ineson 1962 price 1987 price et al 1993 water is discharged quickly through the fractures toward the valleys at times of high recharge thus not allowing the water levels to rise significantly allen et al 1997 whitehead and lawrence 2006 conversely on interfluves the low permeability and storage yield make the chalk aquifer more sensitive to recharge and discharge resulting in greater and faster water level fluctuations between low water and high water periods allen et al 1997 in general groundwater reached the maximum level earlier on interfluves than in river valleys which is reasonable as on interfluves the distance to the groundwater divide line is closer and the time of lateral flow from the recharge zones towards the borehole is shorter rapid drawdown of groundwater level observed at fbn1 and fbn5 implied a low productivity of these two boreholes which could be explained by the thick uz 20 m and low permeability of the aquifer the chalk aquifer of the study area exhibits a very inertial behavior with respect to recharge as evidenced by the slow and progressive temporal variations of the water levels and high stability of water temperature standard deviations 0 1 c table 2 no impact of individual rainfall events was observed suggesting a dominant recharge through the chalk matrix as demonstrated by numerous studies in chalk aquifers e g barhoum 2014 haria et al 2003 ireson et al 2006 mathias et al 2006 smith et al 1970 wellings and bell 1980 however differences are observed at fap sharp increases in water level after rainfall events were observed followed by equally rapid declines fig 3 shows an example of this trend in july 2018 water level started to increase about 1 h after the rainfall event and reached its maximum value about 4 h later 85 45 85 67 m ngf similar rapid responses within 24 h of rainfall were observed in a few previous investigations allen et al 1997 lee et al 2006 allen et al 1997 suggested that this would be expected only if the large fractures had been replenished rapid transfer initiated and subsequently drained during recharge period at fap hourly temperature and ec were also measured and compared with rainfall time series water temperature increased about 2 h after the rainfall and reached its maximum value about 7 h later 11 6 12 2 c ec decreased about 2 h after precipitation and reached the minimum value about 9 h later 625 460 µs cm 1 in july summer the increase in temperature may be easily explained by a higher atmospheric temperature in july compared with groundwater temperature ec decreased due to the dilution by rainwater the variation of temperature and ec combining with that of water level confirms that the aquifer at fap testifies to rapid transfers via a well developed fracturing network thus exhibits no longer an inertial behavior note that the response of water level was faster than that of temperature and ec as the water pressure transfer process was faster than the mixing between rainwater and groundwater rapid flows through fractures are added to matrix flows that are still effective as evidenced by the evolution of groundwater levels on an annual scale fig 2 excess air in groundwater provides also useful information on flow pathways and recharge processes higher excess air values were measured in groundwater at fp1 fa pp and fbn4 these 4 boreholes have a thin uz less than 5 m in 2018 high water period table 2 the water level at pumping station pp is not measured but historical data showed a uz thickness of about 5 m data source infoterre brgm fr it is suggested that at these 4 shallow groundwater sites recharge by preferential fracture flow is favored with more fractures developed near the surface while the other deeper groundwater sites are dominated by matrix flow as fracturing of the chalk decreases with depth haria et al 2003 mathias et al 2006 the preferential flow is guaranteed by water filled small fractures and the capillary channels above the water table resulting in a subsequent rapid rise of water table after rainfalls heaton and vogel 1981 these effects are supposed to favor the formation and entrapment of air bubbles which could possibly explain the higher quantity of excess air in water samples collected at these points note that the borehole fap also has a water table depth of less than 5 m however the excess air values in water were relatively low similar to the mean value of the study si 2 this is consistent with the very developed fracturing network at fap large fractures are less favorable for the air entrapment resulting in relatively low excess air values than other shallow groundwater sites 4 2 origin of major ions the correlation matrix of major ions details of the calculation method and results can be found in si 4 and 5 and relationships between ions fig 4 were used to study the origin of major ions concentrations of ca2 and hco3 ions are significantly correlated fig 4a and si 5 which is consistent with the typical chemistry of chalk groundwater however ca2 hco3 plots fig 4a are not aligned to the 1 1 line edmunds et al 1987 with an enrichment of ca2 compared with hco3 indicating a secondary origin of ca2 in addition to chalk dissolution barhoum et al 2014 ca2 excess compared with hco3 was then plotted with the sum of cl no3 and so4 2 fig 4b most data points are plotted along the 1 1 line implying that ca2 excess may be due to an agricultural source as cl no3 and so4 2 indeed a common agriculture source of cl no3 and so4 2 is also indicated by a significant correlation between these ions si 5 in fact lime cao can be used in agricultural to optimize field ph aquilina et al 2012 bolan et al 2003 and some fertilizers could contain cao or ca2 as secondary or minor component such as tsp super 45 used in the champagne region according to the cl versus na graph fig 4c a high enrichment of cl is observed with respect to the meteoric water line edmunds et al 1987 kloppmann et al 1994 which confirms the cl source due to anthropogenic activities also the correlation is observed between mg2 k and so4 2 ions si 5 these correlation relations imply that mg2 k and a part of so4 2 may have a common terrigenous source in fact chalk impurities and clay minerals in superficial formations mainly colluvium and alluvium in the study area may provide mg2 k as well as so4 2 to groundwater gillon et al 2010 stuart and smedley 2009 4 3 spatial and temporal variations of chalk groundwater geochemistry under effects of hydrogeological setting and residence time 4 3 1 spatial analyses to interpret the spatial distribution of chalk groundwater geochemistry a principal component analysis pca of major ion concentrations and ec was performed details of the method can be found in si 4 fig 5 the first two principal components f1 and f2 justified together 78 of the variance f1 is positively weighted on the allochthonous agricultural ions no3 and cl and on ca2 more weakly and negatively weighted on na mg2 so4 2 k and hco3 which are interpreted as autochthonous ions f2 is positively weighted on ec and all the major ions but the most strongly on ca2 and hco3 which correspond to the typical geochemistry of chalk groundwater dominated by these two ions hierarchical clustering of pca shows a vast spatial heterogeneity of major ion concentrations on the study area and distinguishes six water type groups fig 5 rs1 rs2 and rpy river waters were plotted near the center zone of pca graph implying that the geochemistry of river water was similar to the average condition of groundwater which is justified by the drainage of the whole aquifer by the rivers relatively low concentrations of agricultural ions no3 cl and ca2 were observed at fbn1 and fbn5 which could be explained by the large uz thickness 20 m table 2 whereby the aquifer tended to be less influenced by agriculture activities e g fertilizer applications in contrast higher concentrations of agricultural ions were observed at fvdv pdo fa and fep1 because of smaller uz thickness 10 m table 2 extremely high major ion concentrations at fbn4 were supposed to be related to the landfill located upstream representing an important point source of pollution fp1 and fap have a similar chemical composition with high concentrations on na mg2 so4 2 and k ions especially at these two points the chalk is covered by a large surface of colluvium with relatively high content on clay minerals fig 1 which represents a possibly source of these ions in groundwater low concentrations of major ions were observed at fpm1 fpm3 and pp which could be explained by the presence of superficial formations graveluche and alluvium limiting the transfer of water and solute from surface to the aquifer linoir 2014 the impact of superficial formations overlying the chalk on groundwater geochemistry are further discussed in the following section 4 3 2 temporal variations the temporal variation of geochemistry was explored by analyzing the ec chronicle compared with groundwater level time series fig 6 a combination of hydrogeological setting residence time and land use information was used to explain the temporal variations of chalk geochemistry on the study area area with large fluctuation in water level large fluctuation in water level was observed at fbn1 and fbn5 12 m table 2 ec time series were highly correlated with water level fluctuations fig 6 and table 5 during high water level period in 2018 water level increased substantially following intensive recharge resulting in an increase in ec of about 150 and 300 µs cm 1 at fbn1and fbn5 respectively however no significant variation of ec was observed during high water level period in 2019 as water level was much lower under dry climate conditions according to groundwater dating the groundwater flow was described by the exponential mixing model and a mrt of 18 years was estimated at fbn1 no accurate age was deduced for fbn5 indicating a spatially uniform recharge and a mixture of different flows in this context contaminants concentrated near the land surface area infiltrated progressively across the uz following recharge under low water level conditions the contamination front was disconnected with the sz it transferred slowly downward through the unsaturated chalk matrix meanwhile solutes in the sz were diluted by the mixing process of groundwater so that a low ec was observed as water level rose and reached the contamination front the contamination source was re activated and contaminants concentrations increased rapidly in the sz so that a high ec was observed similar pollutant remobilization processes were previously suggested by brouyère et al 2004 hakoun et al 2017 and orban et al 2010 the highly correlation between time series of no3 cl so4 2 ca2 concentrations and water level fluctuation table 5 confirms this mechanism at fbn4 a high correlation between ec and large water level fluctuation 15 5 m table 2 was also observed in a context of exponential mixing mrt 17 years table 4 however the temporal variation of ec followed that of water level during the whole monitoring period 2017 2019 while ec remained stable at low water levels at fbn1 and fbn5 this could be explained by the thin uz at fbn4 2 5 m table 2 whereby the contaminated area was always partially submerged by groundwater level even during low water level period at fvdv the water level fluctuation was smaller 8 m table 2 resulting in a lower correlation between ec and water level times series r 0 69 table 5 compared to fbn1 fbn4 and fbn5 groundwater consisted mainly of 30 year old water mixed with 25 30 of modern water suggesting small contributions of rapid recharge through fractures area with developed fracture network and low uz thickness ec time series were inversely related to water level fluctuation at fap and fa figs 3 and 6 suggesting that the dilution effect was the most important factor that influences the geochemistry at these two sites the uz thickness was low 3 m table 2 and fractures were supposed to be developed near surface area groundwater dating showed 50 70 and 75 80 of modern water at fap and fa respectively by the binary mixing model table 4 indicating an aquifer constituted mainly by freshly percolated rainwater that favors the process of dilution larger proportion of modern water at fa could be explained by its location close to groundwater divide line receiving few lateral flow it should be noted that even during high water level period the groundwater at fap and fa was composed of 20 to 50 of old water aged over 30 years this older end member is linked to the lateral flow originated from upstream recharge areas area with superficial formation ec values were stable in time at fpm1 and fep1 fig 6 groundwater dating showed a residence time of 30 years at fep1 in a piston flow context indicating a small recharge area away from the site no accurate age was deduced for fpm1 table 4 these two wells are situated in the north of the study area where large surfaces of the chalk are covered by graveluche fig 1 the graveluche layers rich in clayey minerals are less permeable with an infiltration rate about 3 to 4 times slower than in the chalk therefore could constitute a barrier or buffer zone which limits rapid transport of water and solute from surface to the sz linoir 2014 consequently the aquifer received recharge mainly from upstream the graveluche covered area near the champagne mounts fig 1 water traveled laterally in the sz during more than 30 years resulting in a stable geochemistry independent on water level fluctuation at fpm3 downstream the borehole fpm1 fig 1 a time lag was observed between ec and water level time series as a result of delayed solute transfer by the discontinuous graveluche formations at pp ec was also stable with a residence time of about 40 years estimated by a piston flow model table 4 with a high proportion of clayey minerals the alluvium can play the same role as graveluche as a flow barrier on the chalk moreover the deep screen position of pp 23 80 m table 1 allowed pumping of deep groundwater with longer residence time previous studies e g barhoum et al 2014 el janyani et al 2012 have shown that other superficial formations such as flint clay layers can have similar impacts on chalk aquifers area along riverside pdo is a pumping station used for drinking water supply located close to the suippe river fig 1 the drawdown of groundwater level due to intensive exploitation could result in a recharge of aquifer by river water as testified by a higher proportion of modern water in october than in may 2018 table 4 indeed the groundwater level was lower in october resulting in increased flow from the river to the aquifer the ec of river water was relatively stable making the ec at pdo stable over time fig 6 fp1 is a non exploited borehole located in the vesle river valley fig 1 no correlation relationship between ec and water level was observed located far from the groundwater divide line fp1 has a very large recharge area receiving groundwater of different residence times a mean residence time of 35 40 years was estimated in an exponential mixing context table 4 as a result groundwater chemistry was greatly buffered and ec was poorly related to water level fluctuation fig 6 4 4 a conceptual model of aquifer functioning a conceptual model of unconfined chalk aquifer fig 7 was established in order to explore how hydrogeological settings including fracture distribution groundwater level depth superficial formations and aquifer river relationship can influence the hydrogeological functioning of the aquifer in terms of flow pathways mixing process residence time and groundwater geochemistry variation in general under deep groundwater level conditions the geochemistry of the aquifer tends to be less influenced by near surface contaminations with relatively low concentrations of agriculture ions this situation usually occurs on interfluves near the groundwater divide line fig 7a if no superficial formations overlay on the chalk the aquifer receives a spatially uniform recharge and an exponential mixing model could be applied with a relatively short residence time as transmissivity and storage yield are low on interfluve with a thick uz groundwater level fluctuations are important leading to levels of contamination positively correlated to water table dynamics at shallow groundwater sites the thin uz of chalk aquifer is usually highly fractured fig 7b rapid recharge through fractures is favored making groundwater a mixture of freshly percolated water and old water coming from upstream recharge area as demonstrated by a binary mixing model the shallow groundwater sites with high proportion of modern water mainly locate in river valleys where fracture networks are well developed but could also present on interfluves at these sites groundwater geochemistry is mostly influenced by the dilution effects of rainfall leading to mineralization degree of groundwater negatively correlated to water table dynamics superficial formations overlaying on the chalk such as graveluche colluvium and alluvium have important effects on groundwater flow and geochemistry these superficial formations are usually intermitted and constituted by high content of clayey minerals presenting a lower permeability than the chalk they could consequently constitute a barrier limiting the rapid recharge of water and solute into the aquifer at these sites a piston flow model better describes the groundwater flow and relatively old groundwater ages are estimated which could explain the stable or delayed groundwater geochemistry with respect to water table fluctuations fig 7c and d for sites near rivers where groundwater is exploited the exchange between groundwater and river water should be considered fig 7e the recharge of aquifer by rivers could occur especially during low water level period leading to groundwater geochemistry influenced by surface water 5 conclusion the present study brings out interesting implications for the hydrogeological functioning of unconfined chalk aquifers by an approach combining hydrodynamic geochemical and groundwater dating tools based on an intensive sampling network on a watershed scale groundwater level fluctuations and chemical compositions major ions concentrations were monitored continuously during two years 2017 2019 seasonal and annual fluctuations of groundwater level were observed on the study area the hourly data allowed to study precisely the response of aquifer following exploitation activities pumping and rainfalls although the majority of the aquifer has an inertial behavior with respect to recharge a rapid response following rainfalls can be allowed locally by highly developed fractured network in the chalk groundwater dating using cfcs and sf6 was also realized for the first time in this unconfined chalk aquifer despite the frequent contaminations of cfcs and sf6 detected on the study area relevant information on residence times and mixing processes of the chalk groundwater was obtained at the majority of sites the aquifer is made up of waters of different ages ranging from less than 20 years to more than 50 years with piston flow exponential or binary mixing models defined at each sampling site implying for different flow pathways and mixing processes in the aquifer despite the ca2 hco3 chemical facies a high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of groundwater geochemistry in the unconfined chalk aquifer was highlighted on the study area different correlation relationships between the ec time series and groundwater level fluctuations were observed correlated anti correlated or independent these variabilities were explained by a combined effect of water level fluctuation groundwater residence time thickness of the uz superficial formations distribution of fracturing network aquifer river relationships and human activities the combination of different tools allowed the establishment of a conceptual model of chalk aquifer functioning the multi tool methodology developed in this study and the established conceptual model might be used in chalk aquifers or other multi porosity mediums for the prediction of spatial and temporal variations of groundwater mineralization and solutes transport natural or anthropogenic and for the evaluation of aquifer vulnerability however the used methods still have some limitations firstly the two year long time series of groundwater level and geochemical parameters are relatively short to interpret a general and comprehensive mechanism of aquifer functioning then the age dating was disturbed by the contamination of tracers resulting in the missing of groundwater flow information at some sites also the methods focus mostly on a qualitative rather than a quantitative perspective which could limit its application on contaminant transport prediction therefore further investigations would be necessary the monitoring of groundwater level fluctuations and geochemistry can be continued to obtain longer times series with the aim to study the influence of different climate conditions on the chalk aquifer functioning in a climate change context with respect to groundwater dating tritium analysis could be a good complement for cfcs and sf6 especially for sites contaminated by several tracers at last the hydrodynamic and geochemical numerical modeling tool based on the conceptual model established in the study could be a relevant complement credit authorship contribution statement feifei cao conceptualization formal

5913,chalk groundwater is an important aquifer resource it is intensively exploited for human use with a large proportion utilized for drinking water the improvement of the knowledge on chalk aquifer hydrogeological functioning is essential for the management of this resource here we developed a methodology based on a combination of hydrodynamic hydrochemistry and groundwater dating tools a study site with chalk outcrops was selected in ne france where groundwater geochemistry and water level were monitored continuously for 2 years from 2017 to 2019 and groundwater residence time was estimated using cfcs and sf6 overall the aquifer has an inertial behaviour with respect to recharge nevertheless a rapid water level response following rainfall events was observed at one site suggesting the presence of highly developed fracture network at the local scale according to the mixing process piston flow exponential or binary mixing defined at each sampling site groundwater dating indicated rather heterogeneous ages ranging from modern to about 50 years high spatial and temporal heterogeneities were observed and interpreted by a combination of hydrogeological setting residence time and land use information highlighting main factors governing the chalk groundwater geochemistry including water level fluctuation thickness of the unsaturated zone uz superficial formations distribution of fracture network aquifer river relations and human activities a conceptual model was proposed accordingly to explain the hydrogeological functioning of unconfined chalk aquifers keywords chalk aquifer groundwater age water level geochemistry variability water resource unsaturated zone 1 introduction the chalk formation is widespread in northwestern europe covering large areas between the paris basin the london basin denmark and the north west of germany bakalowicz 2018 groundwater of the chalk aquifer is intensively exploited for human use making it one of the most important aquifers over much of northern europe in france the chalk aquifer covers about 20 of the metropolitan territory with a total area of 110 000 km2 crampon et al 1996 roux 2018 and provides approximately 12 billion m3 year 1 of water which accounts for 70 of the drinking water consumed in the north of france lallahem 2002 however in recent decades there is a growing evidence of the deterioration of the european chalk groundwater quality due to human activities baran et al 2008 barhoum 2014 chen et al 2019 hakoun et al 2017 johnson et al 2001 longstaff et al 1992 aquifer protection requires a sound

permeable fissures of low volume e g brouyère 2006 fitzpatrick 2011 van den daele et al 2007 fracture distribution in the chalk is highly heterogeneous vertically fractures are generally only developed towards the top of the aquifer allen et al 1997 laterally fractures are more developed in river valleys than on interfluves as the structural weaknesses followed by valleys are more fractured and erosion along valleys favors the opening of horizontal fractures allen et al 1997 price 1987 price et al 1993 recharge through the uz can occur very rapidly through fractures or slowly within the matrix allen et al 1997 most studies consider that in the uz recharge is predominately through the chalk matrix with a mean downward rate of about 1 m year 1 barraclough et al 1994 brouyère et al 2004 chen et al 2019 haria et al 2003 vachier et al 1987 van den daele et al 2007 wellings 1984 recharge through fractures is faster but smaller in volume it occurs episodically when the infiltration rate exceeds the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix ireson and butler 2011 mathias et al 2006 price et al 2000 rapid flow could also temporally or locally be dominant especially in zones where karstic systems are developed ireson et al 2006 mathias et al 2006 maurice 2009 flow rates have been estimated with values ranging from 1 to 20 km day 1 in karstic systems and up to 1 m h

contribution to the recharge of chalk aquifer but can cause punctual problems on groundwater quality such as nitrate and bacterial contaminations barhoum 2014 chemical composition of the chalk groundwater is mainly controlled by water rock interactions due to the dissolution of primary rock minerals and the precipitation of second phases gillon et al 2010 most of the chemical characteristics of chalk groundwater are acquired during initial percolation through the soil and upper saturated zone sz as the chalk matrix is dominated by carbonate minerals a fast homogeneity of the baseline geochemistry is expected edmunds et al 1987 however spatial and temporal heterogeneities of the groundwater chemistry can be observed due to internal and external factors such as local

understand groundwater flow in chalk aquifers cary et al 2014 darling et al 2012b 2005 gooddy et al 2006 furthermore no studies have combined geological characterization hydrodynamic conditions water level fluctuations and recharge process residence time determination and groundwater geochemistry within a chalk aquifer a methodology that combines these different approaches could provide a comprehensive understanding of the chalk aquifer functioning indeed spatial and temporal heterogeneities of hydrogeological and geochemical properties could exist resulting in a complex aquifer system even on a small scale the aim of this work is to establish a conceptual model of the unconfined chalk aquifer on a water catchment scale in terms of groundwater flow paths mixings and geochemistry for a better understanding of the hydrogeological functioning of the aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area is located at the east of the city of reims in the champagne region ne of france fig 1 and covers approximately 500 km2 between the suippe river as the northern and western boundary and the vesle river as the southern boundary both the two rivers have several tributaries the prosne river tributary of the vesle river is dry for most of the time while others are permanent watercourses fig 1 the cretaceous formations outcropping on the surface of the study area are constituted by coniacian c3 santonian c4 and campanian c5 chalks fig 1 despite the different age of formation the three chalks present a similar lithology the first 10 20 m of the champagne chalk are significantly fractured and the fracturing decreases with depth mangeret et al 2012 vachier et al 1987 the chalk formation is partially covered by tertiary formations 10 50 m laurain et al 1981 at the berru mount and by quaternary formations including graveluche colluvium and alluvium fig 1 graveluche also called grèze refers to a periglacial formation with a maximum thickness of 6 10 m rouxel david et al 2002b during the quaternary the long period of freeze thaw alternation produced movement in the terrain graveluches resulting from this gelification process of the chalk are very variable in particle size and composition with more or less content on clay and silt vernhet 2007 the graveluche formation is more widely spread in the north the catchment area of the suippe river than in the south of the study area colluvium is present mainly in dry valleys with a thickness of about 1 3 m they have substantially the same composition as the soils from which they formed but a higher silt and clay content alluvium deposits are located in river valleys composed mainly by sand clay and gravel vernhet 2007 their thickness could reach about 10 m in maximum with locally accumulated clay layers up to 5 m rouxel david et al 2002b the unconfined champagne chalk aquifer is a crucial water resource of the region it is the only resource used for drinking water and is also largely exploited for agricultural and industrial uses the total porosity of the chalk is about 40 crampon et al 1993 with only 1 related to the effective porosity vachier et al 1987 the champagne mounts constitute the main reliefs where the transmissivity ranges from 10 6 m2 s 1 to 10 5 m2 s 1 whereas in the valleys these values are much higher ranging from 10 2 m2 s 1 to 0 3 m2 s 1 rouxel david et al 2002b the study area is divided into two parts by the groundwater divide line across the summit of berru mount and the champagne mounts which delimits the vesle river watershed in the south and the suippe river watershed in the north according to water levels the chalk aquifer of the study area is generally drained by rivers rouxel david et al 2002a fig 1 the precipitation constitutes the only recharge of the champagne chalk aquifer the climate of the region is temperate oceanic with an average temperature of 11 2 c and average annual precipitation of 566 mm values from meteofrance for 2012 2018 period at reims prunay station fig 1 the annual effective rainfall ranges generally from 100 to 150 mm mainly in winter spring with the rest of the total precipitation being taken by evapotranspiration baran et al 2006 land use of the study area can be divided into three major types 1 agricultural this type occupies the majority of the study area with the main crops of wheat barley sugar beet and alfalfa laurain et al 1981 2 forest this is the second major type of land use which covers in particular the berru and champagne mounts representing about 15 of the surface of the study area 3 anthropogenic this category mainly includes cities and villages and represents about only 3 of the area of the sector with a landfill situated in middle of the study area fig 1 2 2 sampling and analytical methods water samples were collected monthly from june 2017 to june 2019 at 15 sampling points fig 1 including 10 boreholes 2 pumping stations used for drinking water supply and 3 points in rivers in order to take into account the groundwater surface water exchanges the sampling points are well distributed in the study area allowing different geological contexts to be observed properties of sampling points are presented in table 1 in situ video inspection was done to examine the condition of boreholes no abnormalities such as deterioration or cracks were found except for fbn5 inside the borehole fbn5 the casing set inside the borehole consists of a successive of short pvc pipes however these pvc pipes are not well connected and gaps between every two pipes were observed allowing rainwater to seep into the borehole groundwater levels were measured monthly from december 2017 the water level and temperature were recorded hourly in the 9 non exploited boreholes using pressure sensors in situ rugged troll 100 water level logger table 1 in addition a ctd diver water logger schlumberger water services was installed in the borehole fap to monitor hourly electrical conductivity ec as the water level here reacted much faster than the other boreholes following rainfall events in situ parameters were measured monthly at each site temperature ph and ec were measured using a wtw 3320 ph meter and a wtw 3320 conductivity meter alkalinity was determined using a hach digital titrimeter water samples for analysis of major ions ca2 mg2 na k no3 so4 2 cl were collected in two 50 ml polyethylene bottles after filtration through 0 45 µm membranes and the samples for cation analyses were acidified with hno3 the samples were then stored at 4 c before analysis two sampling campaigns for groundwater dating using cfcs and sf6 were carried out in may 2018 high water level and october 2018 low water level waters for cfcs and sf6 analysis were collected in stainless steel ampoules after washing through at least three volumes of the ampoule without any atmospheric contact during sampling waters for noble gases analysis were sampled in 500 ml glass flasks the bottles were submerged in flowing water flushed and capped without headspace to avoid air bubbles analyses of major cations and anions were done by icp optical emission spectrometry icap 6300 thermo and ion chromatography system dionex ics 2000 respectively cfcs and sf6 concentrations in water samples were measured by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector after pre concentration by a purge and trap method described by aquilina et al 2006 and vergnaud ayraud et al 2008 the analytical uncertainty is about 1 3 for cfcs and 5 for sf6 noble gases ar ne were measured using a micro gas chromatograph gc 3000 sra instruments with an uncertainty of about 3 for ne and less than 2 for ar aquilina et al 2006 2 3 estimation of recharge temperature excess air and apparent age the concentrations of noble gases were used to estimate recharge temperature and excess air contribution busenberg and plummer 1992 heaton and vogel 1981 the estimation of the recharge temperature defined as the temperature in the uz above the water table where air water equilibrium is carried out dunkle et al 1993 is essential for determining the solubility of cfcs and sf6 in henry s law excess air refers to dissolution of air bubbles trapped by infiltrating water in the uz heaton and vogel 1981 it is used to correct sf6 data which could be greatly influenced by this parameter in contrast to cfcs ayraud et al 2008 plummer et al 2001 vittecoq et al 2007 the measured cfcs and sf6 concentrations in water samples in pmol l 1 were converted to atmospheric partial pressures in pptv according to the estimated recharge temperature and then compared to the atmospheric evolution curve available on usgs web site https water usgs gov lab software air curve index html to determine the apparent age groundwater is usually a contribution of water from different flow pathways according to aquifer properties as a result conceptual mixing models have to be used to interpret cfcs and sf6 concentration as groundwater apparent ages three models are used in this study for the calculation of apparent ages piston flow model pfm exponential mixing model emm and binary mixing model bmm the piston flow model assumes that a tracer travels from the inlet position recharge area to the outlet position e g a well or spring without any dispersion or mixing jurgens et al 2012 etcheverry 2002 małoszewski and zuber 1982 the exponential mixing model describes an exponential distribution of transit times with a transit time of zero for the shortest flow line and a transit time of infinity for the longest line it is applicable for unconfined aquifers of constant thickness with uniform areal recharge cook et al 2006 the apparent age calculated from emm are expressed by the mean residence time mrt which corresponds to the transit time that is longer than that of 2 3 of the flow lines binary mixing model considers a mixing of young and old water masses which represents the simplest mixing process the proportion of the two components and the apparent age of one of the two components can be calculated this model can be appropriate for aquifers with short circuit pathways karstic aquifers or watershed with transmissivity contrasts jurgens et al 2012 katz et al 2009 michel 2004 3 results 3 1 groundwater level fluctuation chalk groundwater level showed seasonal variations fig 2 the highest water level was reached in march april following the winter spring recharge due to excess of rainfall compared to evapotranspiration then the water level declined due to evapotranspiration excess and drainage by rivers it reached the lowest level in october november fig 2 annual variations were also observed the water level in march april 2018 was much higher than that of the same period in 2017 and 2019 as the winter of 2017 and the spring of 2018 were extremely wet with intensive precipitation the water level during high water season of 2018 was the highest since the last ten years as demonstrated by piezometric chronicles of two boreholes in chalk aquifer near the study area monitored since 2008 ades database 2019 si 1 seasonal water level fluctuations were highly variable on the study area table 2 the changes in water level between high and low water conditions in 2018 were down to 5 m near river valley fap but could reach up to 15 m on interfluve fbn1 fbn4 and fbn5 with the thickness of uz varying from 2 m fap to 26 m fbn1 table 2 the rise of water level was not simultaneous in different boreholes fig 2 in 2018 4 boreholes fbn4 fep1 fp1 and fap reached their maximum levels in april 4 boreholes fa fbn5 fvdv and fpm3 reached their maximum levels in march and 1 borehole fbn1 reached its maximum level in february moreover the rise of water level during recharge period was more rapid than the decline of water level during discharge period this asymmetry was less obvious for boreholes near river valleys fap fp1 fig 2 the chalk aquifer exhibits a very inertial behavior whereby the temporal variation curves of groundwater levels are smooth with rather gentle slopes except for fbn1 fbn5 and fap fig 2 at fbn1 and fbn5 rapid drawdown was observed following pumping for water sampling during low water period fig 2 large fluctuations in water levels were also observed during high water level period probably related to nearby groundwater exploitation for industrial and agricultural purposes in addition at fbn5 rapid increases in water level were observed following rainfall events particularly during high water level period in 2018 this could be explained by a direct infiltration of rainwater into the borehole due to bad conditions of the casing as reported by video observations during period of high soil moisture and intensive precipitation at fap water level also rapidly increased following the rainfall events figs 2 and 3 but with a low range several decimeters it increased about 1 h after the rainfall and reaches a maximum value after 4 h then it stabilizes gradually to its pre disturbance level in the following tens of hours fig 3 the evolution of groundwater temperature and ec in this borehole follow the same pattern fig 3 the video observations show that the tube is in good condition a direct intrusion of rainwater into this borehole is unlikely 3 2 chalk groundwater geochemistry the chemical composition of the monitored groundwater is typical of the chalk groundwater with ca2 and hco3 being the dominant ions table 3 however significant spatial and temporal variations in groundwater geochemistry were observed as shown by the variability of major ions concentrations and ec values average concentrations of ca2 and hco3 at each sampling site ranged from 4 04 to 7 18 meq l 1 and from 3 01 to 4 79 meq l 1 respectively for cl and no3 ions the average concentrations at each site ranged from 0 21 to 1 49 meq l 1 and from 0 31 to 0 88 meq l 1 respectively concentrations of mg2 na k and so4 2 were also variable but much lower than those of other ions table 3 temporal variations in concentrations were different for each major ion from one site to another due to the high variability of the major ions concentrations the mean values of ec at each site varied widely from 410 to 770 µs cm 1 water samples collected at fbn4 were the most mineralized with the highest conductivity and high concentrations of almost all major ions water samples collected at fpm1 and fpm3 were the least mineralized with the lowest values of ec and low concentrations of major ions the ph values of the groundwater samples were relatively homogeneous with average values at each sampling site ranging from 7 07 to 7 48 table 3 surface water samples had the same ca2 hco3 chemical facies as groundwater samples as river water in the study area comes mainly from drainage of the chalk aquifer the ph values 7 94 8 07 were higher than those measured in groundwater 7 07 7 48 the ec mean values at each site ranged from 488 to 517 µs cm 1 with relatively low spatial and temporal variabilities 3 3 groundwater dating by cfcs and sf6 3 3 1 recharge temperature and excess air in groundwater samples ne and ar concentrations ranged from 0 84 10 8 to 1 69 10 8 mol l 1 and 1 71 10 5 to 2 18 10 5 mol l 1 respectively table 4 the recharge temperature and excess air were estimated from the relationship between ar and ne si 2 in may 2018 the estimated recharge temperature was similar in all waters of the study area with an average value of 10 c no recharge temperature information can be estimated at fbn4 due to a high value of excess air in october 2018 the recharge temperature showed a spatial variability with values ranging from 10 and 16 c with an average value of 13 c higher than that in may this is consistent with several months winter recharge with relatively low temperatures making the estimated recharge temperature in water samples in may lower than in october when samples were collected at the low water level with very few recharge in summer the estimated excess air in samples ranged from 0 to more than 8 ml l 1 with an average value of about 3 4 2 ml l 1 no significant difference in excess air values was observed between the two sampling campaigns at fpm1 negative excess air value was observed which could probably due to the absorption by rubber tubes present at this borehole the highest values of excess air were observed in water samples at fp1 fa pp and fbn4 with the maximum value 8 ml l 1 for water sample collected at fbn4 in may 2018 3 3 2 groundwater apparent ages the measured cfcs and sf6 concentrations in water samples in pmol l 1 were transferred to atmospheric partial pressures in pptv according to henry s law the data was rejected when calculated concentrations were greater than atmospheric peak concentrations marked as contamination table 4 a frequent contamination of tracer gases was observed on the study area especially for cfc 12 commonly recognized sources of cfcs contamination include seepage from septic tanks landfills kjeldsen and christophersen 2001 release from polyurethane foam waste kjeldsen and jensen 2001 leaky sewer lines leakage from underground storage tanks infiltration or disposal of industrial wastes and recharge from rivers contaminated with cfcs cook et al 2006 cfcs contamination could also result from agricultural activities agricultural application of pesticides may introduce cfcs particularly cfc 11 to unsaturated air as cfcs are allowed as inert ingredients in pesticide formulations plummer et al 2000 in addition cfcs can sorb into rubber and polymers therefore water samples can also be contaminated with cfcs from contact with these materials such as permanently installed submersible pumps in wells with rubber parts cook et al 2006 dunkle et al 1993 although most sf6 concentrations did not exceed atmospheric peak concentrations apparent ages estimated by sf6 were generally much younger than all the other tracers suggesting some anthropogenic and or natural addition of sf6 anthropogenic sources of sf6 include high voltage electricity supply equipment mg and al melting and landfills darling et al 2012a santella et al 2008 unlike cfcs which come exclusively from anthropogenic sources sf6 can also be present naturally in rocks the major known source of terrigenous sf6 is found in fluorite and granite however significant concentrations of sf6 is also reported in other mineral and rock types such as hydrothermal mineral deposits halite and dolomite busenberg and plummer 2000 harnisch and eisenhauer 1998 the natural presence of sf6 in chalk cannot be excluded as dolomite is commonly present in chalk as impurity barhoum et al 2014 gillon et al 2010 the studied aquifer is unconfined with fractures making the soil and groundwater very vulnerable to contamination the landfill site in middle of the study area fig 1 appears to be a major source of contamination of cfcs and sf6 a small waste deposit site located near the borehole fbn1 fig 1 could also represent a local source of pollution furthermore since the majority of the study area is used as farmland the agricultural application of pesticides could also be a potential source of contamination for cfcs especially cfc 11 plummer et al 2000 it should be noted that water samples collected at fpm1 were contaminated by all the 4 trace gases indeed fpm1 is a private well in a farm where a permanently pumping system is installed water samples were collected directly from the tap air contact with the pumped water may occur between the pump and the tap rubber water tubes connected with the tap could also present a potential source of contamination as a result of frequent contamination some water samples are not datable fbn5 fpm1 and fpm3 as only one or two tracers are valid for calculation and estimated ages are not consistent for different tracer gases cross plots of concentrations for cfc 11 vs cfc 113 and sf6 vs cfc 113 super imposed on the mixing models have been realized si 3 cfc 12 is not used for cross plot due to its frequent contamination also not all water samples were plotted as some of them were concerned by contamination of related tracers with concentrations surpassing the range of axis the plot position of sampling points compared to pfm emm and bmm curves allowed to provide information for the selection of models also the consistency of apparent ages between different tracer gases and between the two sampling campaigns is used for the validation of models when different tracers did not give consistent apparent ages values estimated by cfc 11 and cfc 113 were considered to be more reliable than cfc 12 and sf6 as the latter two tracers were largely influenced by anthropogenic activities on the study area the selected mixing models and estimated residence time are resumed in table 4 groundwater residence time of the study area is rather heterogeneous ranging from modern to about 50 years this result is comparable with previously published data on the champagne mount area with an average residence time of about 25 years mangeret et al 2012 the piston flow model is more suitable for fep1 and pp 30 40 years the exponential mixing model is the best model for fbn1 fbn4 and fp1 mrt from 18 to 40 years the binary mixing model is more suitable for fa fap fvdv and pdo 25 to 80 of modern water and an end member of old water ranging from 30 to more than 50 years residence times estimated by piston flow and exponential mixing model at each point were similar between the sampling campaign of may 2018 high water and october 2018 low water for boreholes applying the binary mixing model significant differences of residence time were observed between the two sampling campaigns at fa fap and fvdv estimated apparent ages for samples collected in may are younger than in october with higher proportions of modern water or younger ages of the old end member at pdo apparent ages for samples collected in may are older than in october with less proportions of modern water age 10 years table 4 4 discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic characteristics the unconfined chalk aquifer of the study area possesses highly heterogeneous hydrological characteristics a higher variation in water levels was observed on interfluves than in river valleys fig 2 attesting differences in transmissivity and storage yield in river valleys high density of active fractures are consistently developed resulting in high permeability of the aquifer haria et al 2003 ineson 1962 price 1987 price et al 1993 water is discharged quickly through the fractures toward the valleys at times of high recharge thus not allowing the water levels to rise significantly allen et al 1997 whitehead and lawrence 2006 conversely on interfluves the low permeability and storage yield make the chalk aquifer more sensitive to recharge and discharge resulting in greater and faster water level fluctuations between low water and high water periods allen et al 1997 in general groundwater reached the maximum level earlier on interfluves than in river valleys which is reasonable as on interfluves the distance to the groundwater divide line is closer and the time of lateral flow from the recharge zones towards the borehole is shorter rapid drawdown of groundwater level observed at fbn1 and fbn5 implied a low productivity of these two boreholes which could be explained by the thick uz 20 m and low permeability of the aquifer the chalk aquifer of the study area exhibits a very inertial behavior with respect to recharge as evidenced by the slow and progressive temporal variations of the water levels and high stability of water temperature standard deviations 0 1 c table 2 no impact of individual rainfall events was observed suggesting a dominant recharge through the chalk matrix as demonstrated by numerous studies in chalk aquifers e g barhoum 2014 haria et al 2003 ireson et al 2006 mathias et al 2006 smith et al 1970 wellings and bell 1980 however differences are observed at fap sharp increases in water level after rainfall events were observed followed by equally rapid declines fig 3 shows an example of this trend in july 2018 water level started to increase about 1 h after the rainfall event and reached its maximum value about 4 h later 85 45 85 67 m ngf similar rapid responses within 24 h of rainfall were observed in a few previous investigations allen et al 1997 lee et al 2006 allen et al 1997 suggested that this would be expected only if the large fractures had been replenished rapid transfer initiated and subsequently drained during recharge period at fap hourly temperature and ec were also measured and compared with rainfall time series water temperature increased about 2 h after the rainfall and reached its maximum value about 7 h later 11 6 12 2 c ec decreased about 2 h after precipitation and reached the minimum value about 9 h later 625 460 µs cm 1 in july summer the increase in temperature may be easily explained by a higher atmospheric temperature in july compared with groundwater temperature ec decreased due to the dilution by rainwater the variation of temperature and ec combining with that of water level confirms that the aquifer at fap testifies to rapid transfers via a well developed fracturing network thus exhibits no longer an inertial behavior note that the response of water level was faster than that of temperature and ec as the water pressure transfer process was faster than the mixing between rainwater and groundwater rapid flows through fractures are added to matrix flows that are still effective as evidenced by the evolution of groundwater levels on an annual scale fig 2 excess air in groundwater provides also useful information on flow pathways and recharge processes higher excess air values were measured in groundwater at fp1 fa pp and fbn4 these 4 boreholes have a thin uz less than 5 m in 2018 high water period table 2 the water level at pumping station pp is not measured but historical data showed a uz thickness of about 5 m data source infoterre brgm fr it is suggested that at these 4 shallow groundwater sites recharge by preferential fracture flow is favored with more fractures developed near the surface while the other deeper groundwater sites are dominated by matrix flow as fracturing of the chalk decreases with depth haria et al 2003 mathias et al 2006 the preferential flow is guaranteed by water filled small fractures and the capillary channels above the water table resulting in a subsequent rapid rise of water table after rainfalls heaton and vogel 1981 these effects are supposed to favor the formation and entrapment of air bubbles which could possibly explain the higher quantity of excess air in water samples collected at these points note that the borehole fap also has a water table depth of less than 5 m however the excess air values in water were relatively low similar to the mean value of the study si 2 this is consistent with the very developed fracturing network at fap large fractures are less favorable for the air entrapment resulting in relatively low excess air values than other shallow groundwater sites 4 2 origin of major ions the correlation matrix of major ions details of the calculation method and results can be found in si 4 and 5 and relationships between ions fig 4 were used to study the origin of major ions concentrations of ca2 and hco3 ions are significantly correlated fig 4a and si 5 which is consistent with the typical chemistry of chalk groundwater however ca2 hco3 plots fig 4a are not aligned to the 1 1 line edmunds et al 1987 with an enrichment of ca2 compared with hco3 indicating a secondary origin of ca2 in addition to chalk dissolution barhoum et al 2014 ca2 excess compared with hco3 was then plotted with the sum of cl no3 and so4 2 fig 4b most data points are plotted along the 1 1 line implying that ca2 excess may be due to an agricultural source as cl no3 and so4 2 indeed a common agriculture source of cl no3 and so4 2 is also indicated by a significant correlation between these ions si 5 in fact lime cao can be used in agricultural to optimize field ph aquilina et al 2012 bolan et al 2003 and some fertilizers could contain cao or ca2 as secondary or minor component such as tsp super 45 used in the champagne region according to the cl versus na graph fig 4c a high enrichment of cl is observed with respect to the meteoric water line edmunds et al 1987 kloppmann et al 1994 which confirms the cl source due to anthropogenic activities also the correlation is observed between mg2 k and so4 2 ions si 5 these correlation relations imply that mg2 k and a part of so4 2 may have a common terrigenous source in fact chalk impurities and clay minerals in superficial formations mainly colluvium and alluvium in the study area may provide mg2 k as well as so4 2 to groundwater gillon et al 2010 stuart and smedley 2009 4 3 spatial and temporal variations of chalk groundwater geochemistry under effects of hydrogeological setting and residence time 4 3 1 spatial analyses to interpret the spatial distribution of chalk groundwater geochemistry a principal component analysis pca of major ion concentrations and ec was performed details of the method can be found in si 4 fig 5 the first two principal components f1 and f2 justified together 78 of the variance f1 is positively weighted on the allochthonous agricultural ions no3 and cl and on ca2 more weakly and negatively weighted on na mg2 so4 2 k and hco3 which are interpreted as autochthonous ions f2 is positively weighted on ec and all the major ions but the most strongly on ca2 and hco3 which correspond to the typical geochemistry of chalk groundwater dominated by these two ions hierarchical clustering of pca shows a vast spatial heterogeneity of major ion concentrations on the study area and distinguishes six water type groups fig 5 rs1 rs2 and rpy river waters were plotted near the center zone of pca graph implying that the geochemistry of river water was similar to the average condition of groundwater which is justified by the drainage of the whole aquifer by the rivers relatively low concentrations of agricultural ions no3 cl and ca2 were observed at fbn1 and fbn5 which could be explained by the large uz thickness 20 m table 2 whereby the aquifer tended to be less influenced by agriculture activities e g fertilizer applications in contrast higher concentrations of agricultural ions were observed at fvdv pdo fa and fep1 because of smaller uz thickness 10 m table 2 extremely high major ion concentrations at fbn4 were supposed to be related to the landfill located upstream representing an important point source of pollution fp1 and fap have a similar chemical composition with high concentrations on na mg2 so4 2 and k ions especially at these two points the chalk is covered by a large surface of colluvium with relatively high content on clay minerals fig 1 which represents a possibly source of these ions in groundwater low concentrations of major ions were observed at fpm1 fpm3 and pp which could be explained by the presence of superficial formations graveluche and alluvium limiting the transfer of water and solute from surface to the aquifer linoir 2014 the impact of superficial formations overlying the chalk on groundwater geochemistry are further discussed in the following section 4 3 2 temporal variations the temporal variation of geochemistry was explored by analyzing the ec chronicle compared with groundwater level time series fig 6 a combination of hydrogeological setting residence time and land use information was used to explain the temporal variations of chalk geochemistry on the study area area with large fluctuation in water level large fluctuation in water level was observed at fbn1 and fbn5 12 m table 2 ec time series were highly correlated with water level fluctuations fig 6 and table 5 during high water level period in 2018 water level increased substantially following intensive recharge resulting in an increase in ec of about 150 and 300 µs cm 1 at fbn1and fbn5 respectively however no significant variation of ec was observed during high water level period in 2019 as water level was much lower under dry climate conditions according to groundwater dating the groundwater flow was described by the exponential mixing model and a mrt of 18 years was estimated at fbn1 no accurate age was deduced for fbn5 indicating a spatially uniform recharge and a mixture of different flows in this context contaminants concentrated near the land surface area infiltrated progressively across the uz following recharge under low water level conditions the contamination front was disconnected with the sz it transferred slowly downward through the unsaturated chalk matrix meanwhile solutes in the sz were diluted by the mixing process of groundwater so that a low ec was observed as water level rose and reached the contamination front the contamination source was re activated and contaminants concentrations increased rapidly in the sz so that a high ec was observed similar pollutant remobilization processes were previously suggested by brouyère et al 2004 hakoun et al 2017 and orban et al 2010 the highly correlation between time series of no3 cl so4 2 ca2 concentrations and water level fluctuation table 5 confirms this mechanism at fbn4 a high correlation between ec and large water level fluctuation 15 5 m table 2 was also observed in a context of exponential mixing mrt 17 years table 4 however the temporal variation of ec followed that of water level during the whole monitoring period 2017 2019 while ec remained stable at low water levels at fbn1 and fbn5 this could be explained by the thin uz at fbn4 2 5 m table 2 whereby the contaminated area was always partially submerged by groundwater level even during low water level period at fvdv the water level fluctuation was smaller 8 m table 2 resulting in a lower correlation between ec and water level times series r 0 69 table 5 compared to fbn1 fbn4 and fbn5 groundwater consisted mainly of 30 year old water mixed with 25 30 of modern water suggesting small contributions of rapid recharge through fractures area with developed fracture network and low uz thickness ec time series were inversely related to water level fluctuation at fap and fa figs 3 and 6 suggesting that the dilution effect was the most important factor that influences the geochemistry at these two sites the uz thickness was low 3 m table 2 and fractures were supposed to be developed near surface area groundwater dating showed 50 70 and 75 80 of modern water at fap and fa respectively by the binary mixing model table 4 indicating an aquifer constituted mainly by freshly percolated rainwater that favors the process of dilution larger proportion of modern water at fa could be explained by its location close to groundwater divide line receiving few lateral flow it should be noted that even during high water level period the groundwater at fap and fa was composed of 20 to 50 of old water aged over 30 years this older end member is linked to the lateral flow originated from upstream recharge areas area with superficial formation ec values were stable in time at fpm1 and fep1 fig 6 groundwater dating showed a residence time of 30 years at fep1 in a piston flow context indicating a small recharge area away from the site no accurate age was deduced for fpm1 table 4 these two wells are situated in the north of the study area where large surfaces of the chalk are covered by graveluche fig 1 the graveluche layers rich in clayey minerals are less permeable with an infiltration rate about 3 to 4 times slower than in the chalk therefore could constitute a barrier or buffer zone which limits rapid transport of water and solute from surface to the sz linoir 2014 consequently the aquifer received recharge mainly from upstream the graveluche covered area near the champagne mounts fig 1 water traveled laterally in the sz during more than 30 years resulting in a stable geochemistry independent on water level fluctuation at fpm3 downstream the borehole fpm1 fig 1 a time lag was observed between ec and water level time series as a result of delayed solute transfer by the discontinuous graveluche formations at pp ec was also stable with a residence time of about 40 years estimated by a piston flow model table 4 with a high proportion of clayey minerals the alluvium can play the same role as graveluche as a flow barrier on the chalk moreover the deep screen position of pp 23 80 m table 1 allowed pumping of deep groundwater with longer residence time previous studies e g barhoum et al 2014 el janyani et al 2012 have shown that other superficial formations such as flint clay layers can have similar impacts on chalk aquifers area along riverside pdo is a pumping station used for drinking water supply located close to the suippe river fig 1 the drawdown of groundwater level due to intensive exploitation could result in a recharge of aquifer by river water as testified by a higher proportion of modern water in october than in may 2018 table 4 indeed the groundwater level was lower in october resulting in increased flow from the river to the aquifer the ec of river water was relatively stable making the ec at pdo stable over time fig 6 fp1 is a non exploited borehole located in the vesle river valley fig 1 no correlation relationship between ec and water level was observed located far from the groundwater divide line fp1 has a very large recharge area receiving groundwater of different residence times a mean residence time of 35 40 years was estimated in an exponential mixing context table 4 as a result groundwater chemistry was greatly buffered and ec was poorly related to water level fluctuation fig 6 4 4 a conceptual model of aquifer functioning a conceptual model of unconfined chalk aquifer fig 7 was established in order to explore how hydrogeological settings including fracture distribution groundwater level depth superficial formations and aquifer river relationship can influence the hydrogeological functioning of the aquifer in terms of flow pathways mixing process residence time and groundwater geochemistry variation in general under deep groundwater level conditions the geochemistry of the aquifer tends to be less influenced by near surface contaminations with relatively low concentrations of agriculture ions this situation usually occurs on interfluves near the groundwater divide line fig 7a if no superficial formations overlay on the chalk the aquifer receives a spatially uniform recharge and an exponential mixing model could be applied with a relatively short residence time as transmissivity and storage yield are low on interfluve with a thick uz groundwater level fluctuations are important leading to levels of contamination positively correlated to water table dynamics at shallow groundwater sites the thin uz of chalk aquifer is usually highly fractured fig 7b rapid recharge through fractures is favored making groundwater a mixture of freshly percolated water and old water coming from upstream recharge area as demonstrated by a binary mixing model the shallow groundwater sites with high proportion of modern water mainly locate in river valleys where fracture networks are well developed but could also present on interfluves at these sites groundwater geochemistry is mostly influenced by the dilution effects of rainfall leading to mineralization degree of groundwater negatively correlated to water table dynamics superficial formations overlaying on the chalk such as graveluche colluvium and alluvium have important effects on groundwater flow and geochemistry these superficial formations are usually intermitted and constituted by high content of clayey minerals presenting a lower permeability than the chalk they could consequently constitute a barrier limiting the rapid recharge of water and solute into the aquifer at these sites a piston flow model better describes the groundwater flow and relatively old groundwater ages are estimated which could explain the stable or delayed groundwater geochemistry with respect to water table fluctuations fig 7c and d for sites near rivers where groundwater is exploited the exchange between groundwater and river water should be considered fig 7e the recharge of aquifer by rivers could occur especially during low water level period leading to groundwater geochemistry influenced by surface water 5 conclusion the present study brings out interesting implications for the hydrogeological functioning of unconfined chalk aquifers by an approach combining hydrodynamic geochemical and groundwater dating tools based on an intensive sampling network on a watershed scale groundwater level fluctuations and chemical compositions major ions concentrations were monitored continuously during two years 2017 2019 seasonal and annual fluctuations of groundwater level were observed on the study area the hourly data allowed to study precisely the response of aquifer following exploitation activities pumping and rainfalls although the majority of the aquifer has an inertial behavior with respect to recharge a rapid response following rainfalls can be allowed locally by highly developed fractured network in the chalk groundwater dating using cfcs and sf6 was also realized for the first time in this unconfined chalk aquifer despite the frequent contaminations of cfcs and sf6 detected on the study area relevant information on residence times and mixing processes of the chalk groundwater was obtained at the majority of sites the aquifer is made up of waters of different ages ranging from less than 20 years to more than 50 years with piston flow exponential or binary mixing models defined at each sampling site implying for different flow pathways and mixing processes in the aquifer despite the ca2 hco3 chemical facies a high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of groundwater geochemistry in the unconfined chalk aquifer was highlighted on the study area different correlation relationships between the ec time series and groundwater level fluctuations were observed correlated anti correlated or independent these variabilities were explained by a combined effect of water level fluctuation groundwater residence time thickness of the uz superficial formations distribution of fracturing network aquifer river relationships and human activities the combination of different tools allowed the establishment of a conceptual model of chalk aquifer functioning the multi tool methodology developed in this study and the established conceptual model might be used in chalk aquifers or other multi porosity mediums for the prediction of spatial and temporal variations of groundwater mineralization and solutes transport natural or anthropogenic and for the evaluation of aquifer vulnerability however the used methods still have some limitations firstly the two year long time series of groundwater level and geochemical parameters are relatively short to interpret a general and comprehensive mechanism of aquifer functioning then the age dating was disturbed by the contamination of tracers resulting in the missing of groundwater flow information at some sites also the methods focus mostly on a qualitative rather than a quantitative perspective which could limit its application on contaminant transport prediction therefore further investigations would be necessary the monitoring of groundwater level fluctuations and geochemistry can be continued to obtain longer times series with the aim to study the influence of different climate conditions on the chalk aquifer functioning in a climate change context with respect to groundwater dating tritium analysis could be a good complement for cfcs and sf6 especially for sites contaminated by several tracers at last the hydrodynamic and geochemical numerical modeling tool based on the conceptual model established in the study could be a relevant complement credit authorship contribution statement feifei cao conceptualization formal

5914,potential environmental impacts on shallow groundwater from shale gas development facilitated by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is a widely debated hot topic in terms of potential aqueous phase contamination including flowback fluids and produced water there is a large gap in knowledge of the indicators for routine monitoring and contamination tracing which should be considered critical and should be prioritized for analysis since formation water from shale formations is the main source of flowback fluids and produced water and there are significant differences in some specific inorganic geochemical and isotopic compositions between shallow groundwater and formation water this study has provided a framework to determine sensitive monitoring and diagnostic indicators for tracing potential groundwater contamination from produced water using end member analysis the results from a case study of the fuling gasfield sichuan basin sw china as the first and largest commercial shale gas development site in china shows that produced authentic formation water with similar br cl and na cl ratio with seawater and low δ2h and δ18o values compared to the evaporated seawater might originate from evaporated seawater modified by water rock interactions and be mixed with fresh meteoric water the inorganic geochemical and isotopic indicators such as ba li na cl br 87sr 86sr as ε sr sw and δ11b are sensitive to the detection of contamination of fresh shallow groundwater by produced formation water even in very small fractions 0 05 meanwhile we present a groundwater contamination case related to shale gas development in the fuling gasfield the robust conservative geochemical cl and br and isotopic δ11b and ε sr sw mass balances show that 0 2 0 9 of formation water entered the shallow groundwater causing contamination the case has also confirmed the effectiveness of those indicators findings from this study may help to improve groundwater monitoring and environmental regulations in countries with shale gas exploration and development keywords groundwater contamination isotopes shale gas hydraulic fracturing produced formation water 1 introduction with the development of the advanced technologies of horizontal drilling and large scale hydraulic fracturing increased shale gas oil production in the united states and canada has changed the global energy market other countries such as china the uk and poland also want to develop shale gas resources estrada and bhamidimarri 2016 however the rapid development of shale gas has raised public concerns and initiated an intense debate about the potential environmental human health and geological risks especially water consumption nicot and scanlon 2012 yu et al 2016 kondash et al 2018 water contamination osborn et al 2011 vidic et al 2013 vengosh et al 2014 and fracturing and or injection of wastewater induced earthquakes weingarten et al 2015 bao and eaton 2016 many european countries such as france germany and bulgaria and some states in the united states such as new york state vermont and maryland have therefore prohibited shale gas development as a key concern in numerous high profile disputes water contamination has been widely followed with interest tollefson 2013 groundwater contamination by stray natural gas and surface water contamination by spillage of flowback fluids and produced waters has been documented osborn et al 2011 jackson et al 2013a darrah et al 2014 lauer et al 2016 shrestha et al 2017 vengosh et al 2017 in most cases the high methane in groundwater of primarily thermogenic origin is natural and is not related to shale horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing molofsky et al 2011 harkness et al 2017 nicot et al 2017 barth naftilan et al 2018 meanwhile there is very little evidence of shallow groundwater contamination from dissolved solid constituents aqueous phase caused by deep formation water or fracturing fluids in shale gas production llewellyn et al 2015 li et al 2016a previous studies have shown that groundwater with high salinity is also caused by naturally occurring processes with a lack of changes in the water quality observed in drinking water wells following the installation of nearby shale gas wells but is not correlated with the location of shale gas wells warner et al 2012 harkness et al 2017 in this situation the water chemistry and isotopes are commonly used to identify possible contamination from produced water as the main contamination source see detailed information in section 2 li et al 2016a used major ionic components and cl tds tds refers total dissolved solids methods to discriminate groundwaters containing thermogenic methane from surrounding groundwater and from produced water in the wattenberg oil and gas field of northern colorado united states however they claimed that trace elements and isotopes would be included for a more comprehensive understanding of the groundwater contamination from shale gas activities most recently harkness et al 2017 used more extensive geochemical and isotopic tracers to study the possible surface and groundwater contamination of dissolved constituents from produced water and or flowback fluids in an area of shale gas development in northwestern west virginia united states for groundwater baseline investigation before shale gas development and routine monitoring during shale gas development sensitive parameters should be first established however there is a large knowledge gap on the most suitable parameters for this purpose ryan et al 2015 vengosh et al 2017 in a number of case studies some useful and robust chemicals and isotopes have not been included in groundwater monitoring programmes or contamination identification processes jackson et al 2013b li et al 2016a li et al 2016b in addition some commonly used indicators such as major ionic components and stable isotopes such as δ2h δ18o δ13c dic may be not sensitive enough to identify produced water in the shallow groundwater associated with shale gas development warner et al 2014 zheng et al 2017 therefore the purpose of this study is to figure out the sensitive inorganic monitoring indicators of shallow groundwater by comparing the geochemical and isotopic composition between shallow groundwater and produced water which could be analyzed in priority and be included in routine monitoring programmes for the study site in china in addition while there is an emerging body of literature on shale gas plays in the north american especially the marcellus shale scientific data of shale formation water from many other regions including china are sparse zheng et al 2017 studied the continental shale in nw china and suggested that the formation water originated from evaporated ancient precipitation ni et al 2018 firstly studied the flowback and produced waters in the weiyuan shale gasfield from the sichuan basin sw china and pointed out that the produced waters in the lower silurian longmaxi marine s1l shale originated from evaporated seawater the other aim of this study is to revisit the geochemical characteristics and to trace the origin of formation water in the s1l shale in the fuling shale gasfield from the sichuan basin using authentic shale formation water rather than flowback produced waters which may be mixed with fracturing fluids 2 description of hydraulic fracturing and water footprint shale gas exploitation has been greatly expanded through the development of horizontal drilling and high volume hydraulic fracturing the fracturing fluid i fig 1 is used to open and produce new and existing fractures in the shale formation under high pressure 45 70 mpa to extract shale gas mainly ch4 the fracturing fluid is composed of water more than 90 and multiple kinds of additives including proppants friction reducers scale inhibitors biocides gelling agents gel breakers and inorganic acid barbot et al 2013 after hydraulic fracturing the fluid flowing back to the surface to relieve the well pressure is called flowback fluids ii which usually takes several weeks barbot et al 2013 produced water iii refers to the fluid that continues to be coproduced with the gas to the surface once the well is placed into production and may be present over the lifetime of the well the flowback fluids and produced water is the mixture of the fracturing fluid and formation water iv the formation water commonly has high salinity with tds up to 10 times that of sea water 300 g l vengosh et al 2014 shrestha et al 2017 ni et al 2018 osselin et al 2018 previous studies in north america and the middle east have shown that flowback fluids are initially mainly composed of fracturing fluids and it is progressively replaced by homogeneous pristine formation water hayes 2009 haluszczak et al 2013 birkle 2016 kondash et al 2017 for example the case of qusaiba hot shale in saudi arabia showed that the flowback fluids were mainly composed of fracturing fluid within the first 7 days e g 72 on the 4th day when the well started to produce the produced water became subsequently replaced by formation water and was composed of 100 of formation water on the 40th day birkle 2016 the hydraulic fracturing case from marcellus shale formation in north america showed that the original formation water in flowback fluids increased from 5 to 8 on the first day to 50 after 12 days warner et al 2014 in the weiyuan shale gasfield formation water accounts for 80 of produced water after one year ni et al 2018 over the lifetime of production of a shale gas well the accumulated volume of produced water will become much more significant relative to the short term and high production rates of flowback fluids vengosh et al 2017 the 92 98 of flowback fluids and produced water typical volume ranges from 5200 to 25 900 m3 per shale gas well in the u s is derived from naturally occurring formation water that is extracted together with shale gas kondash et al 2017 therefore formation waters may have a higher potential to affect shallow groundwater v quality fig 1 over the lifetime of shale gas wells than flowback fluids vengosh et al 2017 ni et al 2018 when the geochemical and isotopic compositions of produced formation water pfw standing for produced water being composed of almost 100 formation water are always significantly different from shallow groundwaters chapman et al 2012 haluszczak et al 2013 birkle 2016 kondash et al 2017 pfws are the ideal end member to identify shallow groundwater contamination caused by leakage or spillage of flowback fluids and produced water the additional reasons are as follows 1 limited robust tracers or artificial tracers could be used to identify fracturing fluids from hydraulic fracturing warner et al 2014 2 for geochemical and isotopic compositions of initial flowback fluids within the first several days that change significantly it is not easy to identify the example end member therefore it is reasonable to use formation water as the end member to identify the monitoring indicators and any possible contamination caused by produced water leakage or spillage 3 study area sampling and analyses as the largest shale gas resources country in the world china has abundant shale gas resources with 31 trillion m3 of technically recoverable resources eia 2015 approximately 20 of recoverable shale gas resources are in the s1l shale in sw china making it the most promising shale gas area in china the fuling gasfield fig 2 located in the sichuan basin sw china has shale gas resources of 600 billion m3 and is the first and largest commercial shale gas area in china since the production of the first shale gas well 1hf in november 2012 there were approximately 300 shale gas wells drilled on 80 pads by the end of 2017 it yielded 6 02 billion m3 of shale gas in 2018 the lithology of the shallow groundwater aquifer in the study area is limestone and dolomite which belong to the lower triassic jianglingjiang group t1 j the feixianguan group t1 f the upper permian group p2 and the lower permian group p1 with a thickness of 277 m 426 m 226 m and 474 m respectively based on the jy1 borehole fig 2 guo 2014 below the triassic and permian carbonate rock there are about 600 700 m thickness shale s2h and s1x as cap rock above the target s1l shale cpcc 2014 yang et al 2016 the thickness of the s1l shale is 200 320 m and the thickness of effective shale gas reservoir is 70 87 m the porosity ranges from 2 9 to 6 5 with an average of 4 7 and the water saturation ranges from 32 to 42 with an average of 36 cpcc 2014 when previous studies showed that shale formation water is immobile engelder et al 2014 balashov et al 2015 the water isotopic composition suggests that there is mixing between injected fracturing fluid and mobile formation water rowan et al 2015 osselin et al 2018 the type of shale formation water pore water or fissure water remains unclear the elevation mainly ranges from 400 to 800 m and dissecting depth ranges from 50 to 150 m lyu et al 2012 the shallow groundwater outcrops as springs there are almost no wells in the area discharge from large springs and underground rivers to the maxi river in the study area ranges from 100 l s to 1000 l s and the runoff modulus is more than 6 l s km2 fig 3 the study area belongs to eroded low mountains with hills and valleys the karst caves in the upper lower triassic jianglingjiang group t1 j are most developed with depth of 12 15 m the discharge of small springs in the shallow karst caves mainly ranges from 0 1 to 1 l s lyu et al 2012 underground rivers and springs develop with depth of less than 150 m lyu et al 2012 li 2014 the shallow groundwater outcrops in the form of springs some of which are used for distributed domestic water supply although the type of lithology in the shallow aquifer is simple the anisotropy is strong enough to result in the heterogeneous occurrences of groundwater and cave springs in this area conditions are typical of a subtropical humid monsoon climate with a high average annual temperature of 17 c the annual average precipitation is 1100 mm and 62 of the total precipitation occurs in may september the study area is a mountainous area and the area of arable land is rare there were no other industrial activities including conventional oil and gas and it is an under developed area since 2013 shale gas exploitation has been flourishing we have investigated the baseline water quality of the shallow groundwater in 2014 li et al 2016b huang et al 2017 especially on inorganic dissolved constituents and ch4 content and isotopic compositions in shallow groundwater there are almost no wells

and discussion 4 1 geochemical characteristics and origin of produced formation water because river water used as fracturing fluid in the fuling gasfield contains tritium 6 9 tu and high content of 14c 100 pmc li et al 2016b the flowback fluids and produced waters must contain tritium and 14c if they are mixed with fracturing fluid the produced water samples after 2 years of commencement of flowback are only sampled in this study to present the shale formation water to the maximum extent those samples have undetected 3h and 14c table s1 suggesting that they were not mixed with any fracturing fluids and standing for authentic formation water the variation of geochemical and isotopic composition is relatively limited table s1 which is reasonable for the relatively homogeneous marine deposition processes for the shale stratum the produced formation water pfw in the fuling gasfield had relatively high tds 57 6 65 3 g l table 1 with cl na type water chemistry fig 4 the na cl and br content of the pfw were approximately twice as high as seawater and the br cl from 0 0034 to 0 0041 with average of 0 0037 and na cl from 0 54 to 0 60 with average of 0 56 mass ratios were closer to the ratios of seawater br cl of 0 0035 na cl of 0 56 langmuir 1997 mazor 2004 the good correlations of formation waters with the seawater evaporation trajectory in na vs cl and br vs cl mccaffrey et al 1987 suggest that they might originate from seawater evaporation fig 5 short of halite precipitation the constituents of formation water were further modified by diagenetic interaction sulfate reduction and water rock interaction the ca enrichment and mg depletion can be seen from the deviations of ca cl and mg cl relations compared with the seawater evaporation trajectory fig 5 the 94 depletion of mg cl mass ratio and 72 enrichment of ca cl mass ratios compared with the evaporated seawater suggest dolomitization of carbonate rocks with the sufficient mg in the evaporated seawater warner et al 2012 mccaffrey et al 1987 haluszczak et al 2013 the nearly complete loss of k from 0 05 to 2 4 mg l k content of 379 mg l for seawater indicates the reaction with low k clay minerals to produce k rich clays such as illite illite smectite and illite account for 96 of total clay minerals of the s1l shale in the study area liu et al 2017 and k feldspar stueber and walter 1991 kharaka and hanor 2014 pfws present boron isotopic compositions δ11b with values ranging from 23 9 to 26 1 and the b cl mass ratio ranging from 0 20 10 3 to 0 21 10 3 the ratio is slightly less than seawater of 0 24 10 3 pfws are depleted in 11b relative to seawater δ11b 39 0 and or evaporated seawater δ11b 39 0 54 7 vengosh et al 1992 similar characteristics of formation water have been reported from the marcellus marine shale formation in the appalachian basin united states δ11b 31 33 warner et al 2014 and flowback and produced waters in the weiyuan shale gasfield δ11b ranging from 22 5 to 33 5 with average of 26 9 in sichuan basin china ni et al 2018 both below seawater or evaporated seawater the phenomenon of low δ11b relative to evaporated seawater was interpreted as the original evaporated seawater modified by subsequent isotopic fractionation during a reaction with the clay minerals such as boron incorporation into the crystal lattice 11b is preferentially incorporated into the clays during the transformation of illite smectite williams et al 2001 warner et al 2014 rather than adsorption on the clay surface resulting in lower b cl and higher δ11b values this is consistent with the mineral composition of shale in the study area minerals in the s1l shale are dominated by quartz 43 for average and clay minerals 36 a few carbonate minerals plagioclase and pyrite table s2 the clay minerals are mainly the illite smectite 58 and illite 38 liu et al 2017 the 87sr 86sr ratios of formation water 0 723966 0 724132 are higher than the silurian seawater at the time of the sedimentation of the shale materials 0 7077 0 7088 burke et al 1982 it is also higher than those of flowback and produced waters 0 716627 0 720248 in the weiyuan shale gasfield and produced water 0 708102 0 715239 in conventional oil gas field in sichuan basin china ni et al 2018 but are reasonably lower than the bulk host shale 0 740246 0 740248 table s2 this implies that more radiogenic 87sr results from the differences of the reaction kinetics of mineral dissolution frost and toner 2004 shand et al 2009 and that the solute 87sr 86sr is in disequilibrium with the whole rock the high value of 87sr 86sr for the s1l shale is consistent with the results from ma et al 2017 when comparing with produced waters in the weiyuan shale gasfiled with the same shale formation in the sichuan basin ni et al 2018 the pfws in the fuling gasfield have higher cl concentration salinity and 87sr 86sr but lower br cl and nacl this may further suggest that our produced water is the end member of the shale authentic formation water without mixing with any fracturing fluids the undetected so4 no3 and no2 indicate the strong reducing and closed environment in pfw the existence of pyrite with content of 3 5 in shale formation table s2 also confirms the reducing environment for formation water in this environment sulfate reduction usually occurs a lack of so4 and a low content of hco3 facilitate the high concentrations of alkaline earth elements e g sr ba in the formation water haluszczak et al 2013 kharaka and hanor 2014 simultaneously the water rock interaction leads to the increased concentrations of sr and ba similarly other metals like mn li cu zn rb fe and rare earth elements which are 31 and 21 413 times the concentration of evaporated seawater based on sr br and ba br ratios the ba contents range from 611 to 908 mg l while sr contents range from 447 to 542 mg l in the pfw table 1 the δ13c dic values in the pfw are as high as 13 6 to 16 2 with hco3 contents of 300 380 mg l table 1 the normal processes of rainfall infiltration and dissolution with shale minerals average δ13c of 1 5 table s2 cannot account for the high δ13c dic value of formation water positive δ13c values of dic co2 are always a clear indication of methanogenesis co2 ch4 in this case where 12c is preferentially allocated into the methane and the remaining co2 and hence dic gets progressively enriched in 13c clark and fritz 1997 the isotopic equilibrium value for δ13c dic would be 25 4 at a shale formation temperature of approximately 80 c which is reasonable compared with the measured value of 13 6 to 16 2 this rare phenomenon was also observed in the st lawrence lowlands where δ13c dic can be up to 31 6 clark and fritz 1997 the ch4 contents in the pfws range from 0 70 to 1 24 mg l the relatively low values may be caused by the water and gas separation processes at the shale gas wellhead the δ13c ch4 of the dissolved gas in the pfws is approximately 30 4 which is within the ranges for the shale gas ch4 composition 28 4 to 31 0 in the fuling gasfield wei et al 2016 suggesting that the dissolved ch4 in pfw is mainly derived from the thermocatalytic methane of shale gas most of the formation waters in marine sedimentary rocks were considered to be connate seawater in origin prior to the use of isotopes white et al 1963 haluszczak et al 2013 kharaka and hanor 2014 use of water isotopes and other tracers formation waters can be derived from holocene meteoric water kharaka and thordsen 1992 such as qusaiba hot shale in the northern exploration area saudi arabia 6000 and 6700 years bp birkle 2016 or from old meteoric water kharaka and carothers 1986 or from connate evaporated seawater knauth and beeunas 1986 particularly in deep sea pelagic and hemipelagic sediments in this case water isotopes can also be modified by water rock interaction and or from mixture of different waters with different age or of different origin and age kharaka and carothers 1986 including fresh meteoric water the water stable isotopes of shale formation water in the fuling gasfield show limited variation average value of 1 3 for δ18o and 27 4 for δ2h and lie to the right of the meteoric water line fig 6 the values are in the range of produced waters in the weiyuan shale gasfield and it was suggested that the evaporated seawater was diluted with meteoric water ni et al 2018 because our authentic formation waters are free of 3h and 14c and na cl and br cl are similar with seawater we assumed that the shale formation water has originated from evaporated seawater short of halite precipitation and diluted with fossil meteoric water age older than 40 ka based on undetected 14c assuming that the seawater was evaporated 4 times then the cl and δ18o would be 76000 mg l and 10 if the evaporated seawater was mixed with the fresh meteoric water the fresh meteoric water δ18o value would approximately be 10 suggesting that the dilution rate is 2 then the cl would be 38000 mg l close to the produced formation water average value of 38756 mg l considering all possible dilution conditions for δ18o and cl the δ18o value of end member for fresh meteoric water would be lower than that of modern groundwater fig 6 this implies that the fossil meteoric water mixing end member was recharged during water during colder climate periods relative to modern conditions clark and fritz 1997 kharaka and hanor 2014 birkle 2016 the other less likely explanation for the depleted heavy isotope δ18o and δ2h of formation water is that the connate water was totally displaced by meteoric water which had undergone evaporation δ18o and δ2h value deviated from meteoric water line and increased compared with initial meteoric water or and water rock interaction resulting in δ18o shift only δ18o increased fig 6 the temperature for the s1l shale reservoir at depth of 2283 2484 m is 79 86 c cpcc 2014 at the condition of a low ratio of water and rock and long residence time the δ18o shift can occur even in low medium temperature qin et al 2005 pang et al 2019 however because the s1l shale formed in a deep seawater shelf depositional environment and was very compact low porosity and permeability cpcc 2014 li et al 2014 the connate seawater is less likely to be totally displaced by other water including meteoric water therefore the authentic formation water from the s1l shale is most likely to originate from evaporated seawater and be mixed with meteoric water 4 2 geochemical characteristics of shallow groundwater the shallow groundwater is typical karst groundwater derived from meteoric water fig 6 with tds ranging from 146 to 402 mg l average 267 mg l and with hco3 ca and hco3 ca mg water chemistry types fig 4 the cl 0 9 to 32 mg l with an average of 5 0 mg l and trace element contents are very low compared with those of the pfw table 1 the mass ratio of na cl ranges from 0 10 to 1 22 with an average of 0 39 and br cl ranges from 0 0043 to 0 0178 with an average of 0 0111 the br cl of shallow groundwater is higher than the formation water based on a previous study li et al 2016b the shallow groundwaters have tritium contents ranging from 6 5 to 8 6 tu suggesting a young age of the groundwater and quick circulation for this karst shallow groundwater the 87sr 86sr ratios of shallow groundwater 0 707884 0 709362 table 1 overlapped with the value of the carbonate of aquifer 0 708026 0 709487 table s2 the 87sr 86sr ratios of shallow groundwater are significantly lower than shale formation water the sr concentration ranges from 0 09 to 1 38 mg l the δ11b 12 1 to 14 2 and b cl molar ratios 2 9 10 3 to 10 8 10 3 are all within the values of global meteoric freshwaters lemarchand et al 2002 warner et al 2014 as expected the methane contents for shallow groundwater in the fuling gasfield are all less than 0 01 mg l table 1 while the defined action level for hazard mitigation recommended by the us office of the interior is 10 28 mg l eltschlager et al 2001 the detected δ13c ch4 for the shallow groundwater the mass contents are also below 0 01 mg l ranges from 74 4 to 49 1 suggesting biogenic origin however the relatively high value 49 1 for sample w25 could be biogenic methane that has undergone methane oxidation which leads to an increase in δ13c ch4 barker and fritz 1981 the geochemical and isotopic characteristics of shallow groundwater are consistent with the baseline water quality investigation with respective to shale gas development li et al 2016b 4 3 determination of sensitive monitoring indicators the sensitive monitoring indicators are significantly important to assess and trace potential groundwater contamination caused by shale gas development based on the details given in section 2 formation water is the important end member to identify the potential monitoring indicators when the dissolved inorganic constituents and specific isotopic compositions for pfw are always significantly different from shallow groundwater sensitive monitoring indicators can be obtained through end member analysis there is a random variation for a specific ion or and its isotopic composition for a natural groundwater system without any contamination a random value of the ion content or and its isotopic composition would lie in the range of average value 3σ with a probability of 99 7 pauta criterion where σ is the standard deviation if one groundwater is contaminated by mixing with x produced formation water pfw in this case the relevant ions and isotopic compositions in this contaminated groundwater would change δ for ions δ ion c p f w x c sg 1 x c sg c p f w x c sg x for isotope e g δ11b δ13c ε sr sw δ2h and δ18o δ iso c p f w r pfw x c sg r sg 1 x c p f w x c sg 1 x r sg where c is the average concentration for specific ions in produced formation water pfw and in shallow groundwater sg and r is isotopic value if the change δ is equal to 3σ then the x is considered as the threshold value to cause changes in ion or and isotope ratio of shallow groundwater by contamination and then chemical compatibility is considered for the mixing process between formation water and shallow groundwater the result fig 7 shows that less than 0 05 of produced formation water mixed with 99 95 of shallow groundwater would result in statistical increases of ba 0 006 ε sr sw 0 008 li 0 012 δ11b 0 03 na 0 03 cl 0 035 br 0 041 and nh4 0 049 for shallow groundwater b and sr content would be measured when using its isotope however during the mixing process it is possible to precipitate solid solutions from supersaturated conditions using mix of geochemical model phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 when 0 006 of produced formation water mixed with 99 994 of shallow groundwater the ba content of the mixture will increase from 26 μg l to 78 μg l with statistical significance compared with shallow groundwater at the stage the saturation indices si of barite baso4 is 0 30 suggesting that barite is undersaturated and ba would not precipitate until barite reaches equilibrium state i e si 0 with the mixing ratio reaching 0 015 and content reaching 156 μg l 6 times higher than the content of shallow groundwater table 2 this demonstrates that ba is a robust indicator to trace mixing process in addition in few cases an actual control of solutes by equilibrium with a mineral can be demonstrated and then the saturation state merely indicates in which direction the processes may go for subsaturation dissolution is expected and supersaturation suggests precipitation shen et al 1993 drever 1988 appelo and postma 2005 for example the contaminated shallow groundwater csg w and csg d has si barite of 0 46 and 0 44 with the ba content of 714 μg l and 426 μg l at supersaturation state table 2 the nh4 can be easily oxidized into no3 during mixing process with shallow oxidized groundwater which is not inert and sensitive na cl and br are inert tracers and only precipitate at very higher salinity the other tracers including sr ε sr sw and b δ11b are relatively chemically compatible at low mixing ratios ppw sw and the contents are all lower than the contaminated shallow groundwater table 2 this means that less than 0 05 of pfw mixed with sgw caused by contamination can even be recognized using the defined multiple tracers like ba ε sr sw li δ11b na cl and br in the fuling gasfield which can be regarded as sensitive monitoring indicators and be analyzed as a priority during groundwater monitoring for example assuming b and sr behave conservatively si strontianite 1 26 which is a reasonable assumption a mixture of 0 05 pfw mixed with 99 95 shallow groundwater in this situation shallow groundwater should be contaminated would result in an average 3 9 increase in δ11b 92 0 increase in ε sr sw fig 8 this would also result in obviously increase in concentration of these dissolved constituents using mix of geochemical model phreeqc with equilibrium phase of barite for b 54 br 60 sr 76 cl 414 ba 517 na 603 and li 1438 fig 5 fig 9 in addition the ion ratio such as b cl br cl and sr ca also show the differences between formation water and shallow groundwater fig 10 and can be used to trace shallow groundwater contamination however conventional monitoring indicators conducted by the local environmental protection bureau such as ph compounds of nitrogen no3 no2 and nh4 codmn and major ions are not sensitive or practical for assessing the impact of shale gas development on the groundwater environment for example even at 1 pfw entering shallow groundwater the contributions of codmn 1 2 mg l to shallow groundwater is not obvious and can also be covered up by the natural random variation for example the maximum codmn content in shallow groundwater is 2 9 mg l and the average value is 1 1 mg l table 1 in addition compounds of nitrogen and codmn in shallow groundwater can be easily affected by natural biogeochemistry processes agricultural activities and domestic sewage li et al 2016b huang et al 2019 previous studies have extensively studied the characteristics of flowback fluids and produced water for example hayes 2009 conducted extensive measurements of flowback fluids and produced water including general chemistry metals semi volatile organic compounds organophosphorus pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs however it is noted that pesticides pcbs and a large fraction of the semi volatile constituents should be considered to be unnecessary for the sampling and analysis of flowback fluids because of the very low concentration in flowback fluids and produced water other tracers such as major elements li et al 2016a 87sr 86sr chapman et al 2012 zheng et al 2017 δ11b and δ7li warner et al 2014 harkness et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 have also been used for identifying the produced water of hydraulic fracturing however this study has relatively systematically demonstrated the framework to figure out sensitive indicators for tracing groundwater contamination leakage from saline flowback fluids and produced water during shale gas development when the theoretical framework is compatible the specific monitoring indicators are changeable among different sites furthermore regulators suggesting rules for environmental monitoring often have costs in mind this study demonstrated that some simple and relatively cheap chemical parameters such as br cl na li ba concentrations can be effective in tracing leakage of saline fluids therefore routine monitoring can include those parameters when there is potential contamination trend or and abnormal values the isotopes such as 87sr 86sr δ11b δ7li and even other non traditional stable isotopes can be further used to trace the contamination and to confirm whether it is related to shale gas development when the aforementioned sensitive inorganic monitoring indicators can be used to identify produced formation water in shallow groundwater at a very small portion some ions can also reach the threshold of drinking water causing shallow groundwater quality to deteriorate this portion can be as small as 0 08 for ba chemical compatibility is not considered here for safety this means that 1 m3 produced formation water can pollute 1200 m3 shallow groundwater in the fuling gasfield which cannot be suitable to drink anymore therefore this produced water should be carefully disposed of 4 4 tracing shallow groundwater contamination we found one karst spring with unusual water chemistry and isotopic composition when compared with the regional normal shallow groundwater this spring is located in a lower reach of a shale gas pad with a distance of 70 m to a wastewater pond near the pad the pond was constructed using concrete and the bottom and the sides of the pond were cemented the pond has been used to store flowback fluids and produced water from the pad the tds of this contaminated shallow groundwater csg was 674 788 mg l which is much higher than baseline shallow groundwater samples from the area 146 402 mg l the cl hco3 na ca type of contaminated water indicated a mixing of pfw and shallow groundwater fig 4 in addition the sensitive and diagnostic indexes such as cl vs br cl vs na li vs ba were in the mixing line of the shallow groundwater and pfw fig 5 and fig 9 the chemical characteristics indicated that the shallow groundwater samples were contaminated by pfw and this was further verified by isotopic signatures 87sr 86sr and δ11b the contaminated groundwater with a high ε sr sw value of 124 4 and sr concentration 1 57 1 81 mg l deviated from the baseline shallow groundwater with a low ε sr sw value from 18 1 to 2 7 and low sr concentration 0 09 1 38 mg l the contaminated groundwater ε sr sw values and sr concentrations were in the range of shallow groundwater and pfw ε sr sw 208 7 to 211 0 sr 499 542 mg l for pfw fig 8 the contaminated groundwater had a higher δ11b value 21 2 21 5 when compared with baseline shallow groundwater samples δ11b value ranging from 12 1 to 14 2 the δ11b and b cl 0 69 0 82 10 3 molar ratio of the contaminated groundwater was also in the mixing line of shallow groundwater and pfw however the ch4 content of the contaminated shallow groundwater was less than 0 01 mg l and then δ13c ch4 was not detected compared with sr b and cl water stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h were less sensitive to the mixing of pfw and shallow groundwater fig 6 this lack of apparent isotopic shift of contaminated shallow groundwater may indicate that the mixing ratio was too small to measure changes in δ18o and δ2h the minimum required proportion of pfw is at least 25 in order to detect δ18o and δ2h changes normally in this case the percentage of formation water in the contaminated shallow groundwater can be estimated from the pfw as an end member which is the main source of dissolved solutes for flowback fluids and or produced water assuming cl br b and sr behave conservatively the mixing ratio can be quantified based on isotopes and conservative solute mass balances assuming the mixing ratio for formation water pfw into shallow groundwater sg is x which would result in contaminated shallow groundwater csg for isotopes i e δ11b and ε sr sw the x is given by x c c s g r csg c sg r sg c p f w r pfw c sg r sg for conservative ions i e cl and br the x is given by x c c s g c sg c p f w c sg where c is the average concentration for a specific ion in produced formation water pfw shallow groundwater sg and contaminated shallow groundwater csg and r is the isotopic value the results show that the pfw was 0 2 0 9 of the contaminated shallow groundwater table 3 based on the average values both for shallow groundwater and produced formation water the contamination caused significant increases in cl na ba and li the cl and ba contents have exceeded the threshold of the standard for drinking water quality of china gb5749 2006 and therefore this drinking water source has been abandoned the robust geochemical and isotopic evidence shows that the shallow groundwater contamination is related to shale gas development the breakthrough pressure of the cap rock for the target shale stratum is as high as 64 5 70 4 mpa at 80 c and the thickness of the regional cap rock is 600 700 m cpcc 2014 therefore the deep formation water cannot extend to the shallow karst aquifer in the study area due to the thick shale cap rock two possible mechanisms may be responsible for the observed contamination first poor shale gas well integrity may be responsible for contamination because this issue occurs in 1 10 of conventional oil and gas wells stuart 2012 jackson et al 2013b vidic et al 2013 ingraffea et al 2014 and unconventional oil and gas wells may have more integrity issues rahm and riha 2014 ingraffea et al 2014 however there is no evidence to show the imperfectly sealed shale gas well around the pad based on site conditions a second source of contamination may be from wastewater pond leaks based on site investigation the contaminated groundwater spring is located in the downstream of groundwater flow direction around a shale gas pad and only approximately 70 m close to a wastewater pond after the wastewater pond was abandoned the water quality of the spring has been improved since april 2017 the results show that the concentrations of diagnostic indexes had decreased from 426 to 714 to 166 μg l for ba from 423 to 450 to 18 3 μg l for li from 150 to 173 to 24 7 mg l for na from 278 to 288 mg l to 42 mg l for cl and from 1 28 to 1 38 mg l to 0 31 mg l for br respectively table s1 therefore leakage from the waste water pond is suspected although the contamination processes or pathways cannot be verified in this high heterogeneity and anisotropy karst aquifer this study has confirmed that groundwater contamination has occurred related to shale gas development it has also confirmed that the determined sensitive inorganic monitoring indicators can be used to trace groundwater contamination aqueous phase related to shale gas development in addition while most studies have shown that even at the first weeks after hydraulic fracturing there is about 5 50 of formation water in flowback fluids hayes 2009 warner et al 2014 birkle 2016 kondash et al 2017 ni et al 2018 osselin et al 2018 mainly using cl and water isotopes this study shows that 0 05 of formation water mixed with shallow groundwater can cause contamination and suggests that the method can also trace contamination from leakage of flowback fluids in the first weeks after hydraulic fracturing i e even 1 of flowback fluids in shallow groundwater can be identified in the fuling gasfield however specific flowback fluids cannot be determined 5 conclusions geochemical and isotopic compositions of produced authentic formation water suggest that pfw in the fuling gasfield might originate from evaporated seawater modified by water rock interactions and be mixed with fresh meteoric water the significant differences in geochemical and specific isotopic compositions between pfw and shallow groundwater make it possible to figure out the sensitive indicators and diagnostic indexes to trace or identify potential groundwater contamination caused by flowback fluids and produced water leakage of shale gas development the determined indicators can be analyzed as a priority for baseline water quality investigation and in routine monitoring programmes during shale gas development the study in the fuling gasfield in sw china shows that geochemical such as ba li na cl br b sr br cl b cl sr ca and isotopic signatures such as δ11b and ε sr sw are sensitive for detecting the contamination of fresh water from flowback fluids and produced water leakage during shale gas development even in small proportions this actual groundwater contamination case has confirmed the effectiveness of the method therefore those indicators could be included in the current routine monitoring project the findings of this study could improve the shallow groundwater monitoring programme in shale gas

5914,potential environmental impacts on shallow groundwater from shale gas development facilitated by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is a widely debated hot topic in terms of potential aqueous phase contamination including flowback fluids and produced water there is a large gap in knowledge of the indicators for routine monitoring and contamination tracing which should be considered critical and should be prioritized for analysis since formation water from shale formations is the main source of flowback fluids and produced water and there are significant differences in some specific inorganic geochemical and isotopic compositions between shallow groundwater and formation water this study has provided a framework to determine sensitive monitoring and diagnostic indicators for tracing potential groundwater contamination from produced water using end member analysis the results from a case study of the fuling gasfield sichuan basin sw china as the first and largest commercial shale gas development site in china shows that produced authentic formation water with similar br cl and na cl ratio with seawater and low δ2h and δ18o values compared to the evaporated seawater might originate from evaporated seawater modified by water rock interactions and be mixed with fresh meteoric water the inorganic geochemical and isotopic indicators such as ba li na cl br 87sr 86sr as ε sr sw and δ11b are sensitive to the detection of contamination of fresh shallow groundwater by produced formation water even in very small fractions 0 05 meanwhile we present a groundwater contamination case related to shale gas development in the fuling gasfield the robust conservative geochemical cl and br and isotopic δ11b and ε sr sw mass balances show that 0 2 0 9 of formation water entered the shallow groundwater causing contamination the case has also confirmed the effectiveness of those indicators findings from this study may help to improve groundwater monitoring and environmental regulations in countries with shale gas exploration and development keywords groundwater contamination isotopes shale gas hydraulic fracturing produced formation water 1 introduction with the development of the advanced technologies of horizontal drilling and large scale hydraulic fracturing increased shale gas oil production in the united states and canada has changed the global energy market other countries such as china the uk and poland also want to develop shale gas resources estrada and bhamidimarri 2016 however the rapid development of shale gas has raised public concerns and initiated an intense debate about the potential environmental human health and geological risks especially water consumption nicot and scanlon 2012 yu et al 2016 kondash et al 2018 water contamination osborn et al 2011 vidic et al 2013 vengosh et al 2014 and fracturing and or injection of wastewater induced earthquakes weingarten et al 2015 bao and eaton 2016 many european countries such as france germany and bulgaria and some states in the united states such as new york state vermont and maryland have therefore prohibited shale gas development as a key concern in numerous high profile disputes water contamination has been widely followed with interest tollefson 2013 groundwater contamination by stray natural gas and surface water contamination by spillage of flowback fluids and produced waters has been documented osborn et al 2011 jackson et al 2013a darrah et al 2014 lauer et al 2016 shrestha et al 2017 vengosh et al 2017 in most cases the high methane in groundwater of primarily thermogenic origin is natural and is not related to shale horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing molofsky et al 2011 harkness et al 2017 nicot et al 2017 barth naftilan et al 2018 meanwhile there is very little evidence of shallow groundwater contamination from dissolved solid constituents aqueous phase caused by deep formation water or fracturing fluids in shale gas production llewellyn et al 2015 li et al 2016a previous studies have shown that groundwater with high salinity is also caused by naturally occurring processes with a lack of changes in the water quality observed in drinking water wells following the installation of nearby shale gas wells but is not correlated with the location of shale gas wells warner et al 2012 harkness et al 2017 in this situation the water chemistry and isotopes are commonly used to identify possible contamination from produced water as the main contamination source see detailed information in section 2 li et al 2016a used major ionic components and cl tds tds refers total dissolved solids methods to discriminate groundwaters containing thermogenic methane from surrounding groundwater and from produced water in the wattenberg oil and gas field of northern colorado united states however they claimed that trace elements and isotopes would be included for a more comprehensive understanding of the groundwater contamination from shale gas activities most recently harkness et al 2017 used more extensive geochemical and isotopic tracers to study the possible surface and groundwater contamination of dissolved constituents from produced water and or flowback fluids in an area of shale gas development in northwestern west virginia united states for groundwater baseline investigation before shale gas development and routine monitoring during shale gas development sensitive parameters should be first established however there is a large knowledge gap on the most suitable parameters for this purpose ryan et al 2015 vengosh et al 2017 in a number of case studies some useful and robust chemicals and isotopes have not been included in groundwater monitoring programmes or contamination identification processes jackson et al 2013b li et al 2016a li et al 2016b in addition some commonly used indicators such as major ionic components and stable isotopes such as δ2h δ18o δ13c dic may be not sensitive enough to identify produced water in the shallow groundwater associated with shale gas development warner et al 2014 zheng et al 2017 therefore the purpose of this study is to figure out the sensitive inorganic monitoring indicators of shallow groundwater by comparing the geochemical and isotopic composition between shallow groundwater and produced water which could be analyzed in priority and be included in routine monitoring programmes for the study site in china in addition while there is an emerging body of literature on shale gas plays in the north american especially the marcellus shale scientific data of shale formation water from many other regions including china are sparse zheng et al 2017 studied the continental shale in nw china and suggested that the formation water originated from evaporated ancient precipitation ni et al 2018 firstly studied the flowback and produced waters in the weiyuan shale gasfield from the sichuan basin sw china and pointed out that the produced waters in the lower silurian longmaxi marine s1l shale originated from evaporated seawater the other aim of this study is to revisit the geochemical characteristics and to trace the origin of formation water in the s1l shale in the fuling shale gasfield from the sichuan basin using authentic shale formation water rather than flowback produced waters which may be mixed with fracturing fluids 2 description of hydraulic fracturing and water footprint shale gas exploitation has been greatly expanded through the development of horizontal drilling and high volume hydraulic fracturing the fracturing fluid i fig 1 is used to open and produce new and existing fractures in the shale formation under high pressure 45 70 mpa to extract shale gas mainly ch4 the fracturing fluid is composed of water more than 90 and multiple kinds of additives including proppants friction reducers scale inhibitors biocides gelling agents gel breakers and inorganic acid barbot et al 2013 after hydraulic fracturing the fluid flowing back to the surface to relieve the well pressure is called flowback fluids ii which usually takes several weeks barbot et al 2013 produced water iii refers to the fluid that continues to be coproduced with the gas to the surface once the well is placed into production and may be present over the lifetime of the well the flowback fluids and produced water is the mixture of the fracturing fluid and formation water iv the formation water commonly has high salinity with tds up to 10 times that of sea water 300 g l vengosh et al 2014 shrestha et al 2017 ni et al 2018 osselin et al 2018 previous studies in north america and the middle east have shown that flowback fluids are initially mainly composed of fracturing fluids and it is progressively replaced by homogeneous pristine formation water hayes 2009 haluszczak et al 2013 birkle 2016 kondash et al 2017 for example the case of qusaiba hot shale in saudi arabia showed that the flowback fluids were mainly composed of fracturing fluid within the first 7 days e g 72 on the 4th day when the well started to produce the produced water became subsequently replaced by formation water and was composed of 100 of formation water on the 40th day birkle 2016 the hydraulic fracturing case from marcellus shale formation in north america showed that the original formation water in flowback fluids increased from 5 to 8 on the first day to 50 after 12 days warner et al 2014 in the weiyuan shale gasfield formation water accounts for 80 of produced water after one year ni et al 2018 over the lifetime of production of a shale gas well the accumulated volume of produced water will become much more significant relative to the short term and high production rates of flowback fluids vengosh et al 2017 the 92 98 of flowback fluids and produced water typical volume ranges from 5200 to 25 900 m3 per shale gas well in the u s is derived from naturally occurring formation water that is extracted together with shale gas kondash et al 2017 therefore formation waters may have a higher potential to affect shallow groundwater v quality fig 1 over the lifetime of shale gas wells than flowback fluids vengosh et al 2017 ni et al 2018 when the geochemical and isotopic compositions of produced formation water pfw standing for produced water being composed of almost 100 formation water are always significantly different from shallow groundwaters chapman et al 2012 haluszczak et al 2013 birkle 2016 kondash et al 2017 pfws are the ideal end member to identify shallow groundwater contamination caused by leakage or spillage of flowback fluids and produced water the additional reasons are as follows 1 limited robust tracers or artificial tracers could be used to identify fracturing fluids from hydraulic fracturing warner et al 2014 2 for geochemical and isotopic compositions of initial flowback fluids within the first several days that change significantly it is not easy to identify the example end member therefore it is reasonable to use formation water as the end member to identify the monitoring indicators and any possible contamination caused by produced water leakage or spillage 3 study area sampling and analyses as the largest shale gas resources country in the world china has abundant shale gas resources with 31 trillion m3 of technically recoverable resources eia 2015 approximately 20 of recoverable shale gas resources are in the s1l shale in sw china making it the most promising shale gas area in china the fuling gasfield fig 2 located in the sichuan basin sw china has shale gas resources of 600 billion m3 and is the first and largest commercial shale gas area in china since the production of the first shale gas well 1hf in november 2012 there were approximately 300 shale gas wells drilled on 80 pads by the end of 2017 it yielded 6 02 billion m3 of shale gas in 2018 the lithology of the shallow groundwater aquifer in the study area is limestone and dolomite which belong to the lower triassic jianglingjiang group t1 j the feixianguan group t1 f the upper permian group p2 and the lower permian group p1 with a thickness of 277 m 426 m 226 m and 474 m respectively based on the jy1 borehole fig 2 guo 2014 below the triassic and permian carbonate rock there are about 600 700 m thickness shale s2h and s1x as cap rock above the target s1l shale cpcc 2014 yang et al 2016 the thickness of the s1l shale is 200 320 m and the thickness of effective shale gas reservoir is 70 87 m the porosity ranges from 2 9 to 6 5 with an average of 4 7 and the water saturation ranges from 32 to 42 with an average of 36 cpcc 2014 when previous studies showed that shale formation water is immobile engelder et al 2014 balashov et al 2015 the water isotopic composition suggests that there is mixing between injected fracturing fluid and mobile formation water rowan et al 2015 osselin et al 2018 the type of shale formation water pore water or fissure water remains unclear the elevation mainly ranges from 400 to 800 m and dissecting depth ranges from 50 to 150 m lyu et al 2012 the shallow groundwater outcrops as springs there are almost no wells in the area discharge from large springs and underground rivers to the maxi river in the study area ranges from 100 l s to 1000 l s and the runoff modulus is more than 6 l s km2 fig 3 the study area belongs to eroded low mountains with hills and valleys the karst caves in the upper lower triassic jianglingjiang group t1 j are most developed with depth of 12 15 m the discharge of small springs in the shallow karst caves mainly ranges from 0 1 to 1 l s lyu et al 2012 underground rivers and springs develop with depth of less than 150 m lyu et al 2012 li 2014 the shallow groundwater outcrops in the form of springs some of which are used for distributed domestic water supply although the type of lithology in the shallow aquifer is simple the anisotropy is strong enough to result in the heterogeneous occurrences of groundwater and cave springs in this area conditions are typical of a subtropical humid monsoon climate with a high average annual temperature of 17 c the annual average precipitation is 1100 mm and 62 of the total precipitation occurs in may september the study area is a mountainous area and the area of arable land is rare there were no other industrial activities including conventional oil and gas and it is an under developed area since 2013 shale gas exploitation has been flourishing we have investigated the baseline water quality of the shallow groundwater in 2014 li et al 2016b huang et al 2017 especially on inorganic dissolved constituents and ch4 content and isotopic compositions in shallow groundwater there are almost no wells therefore a total of 64 regional spring waters as shallow groundwater sg were collected in wet may june and dry seasons october november most were re visited in the fuling gasfield fig 3 a contaminated shallow groundwater csg also spring found during field investigation was sampled twice in the wet and dry season in 2016 the four pfw samples after two years of commencement flowback were

groundwater sample was stored in two 25 ml brown glass bottles with acid added in the field an approximately 2 ml aliquot of the headspace gas by displacing 10 of the water with high purity helium was removed with a gas tight syringe and was injected into a gas chromatograph for shallow groundwater methane content measurement in the shanghai sep analytical service using the procedure of usepa rsk

and discussion 4 1 geochemical characteristics and origin of produced formation water because river water used as fracturing fluid in the fuling gasfield contains tritium 6 9 tu and high content of 14c 100 pmc li et al 2016b the flowback fluids and produced waters must contain tritium and 14c if they are mixed with fracturing fluid the produced water samples after 2 years of commencement of flowback are only sampled in this study to present the shale formation water to the maximum extent those samples have undetected 3h and 14c table s1 suggesting that they were not mixed with any fracturing fluids and standing for authentic formation water the variation of geochemical and isotopic composition is relatively limited table s1 which is reasonable for the relatively homogeneous marine deposition processes for the shale stratum the produced formation water pfw in the fuling gasfield had relatively high tds 57 6 65 3 g l table 1 with cl na type water chemistry fig 4 the na cl and br content of the pfw were approximately twice as high as seawater and the br cl from 0 0034 to 0 0041 with average of 0 0037 and na cl from 0 54 to 0 60 with average of 0 56 mass ratios were closer to the ratios of seawater br cl of 0 0035 na cl of 0 56 langmuir 1997 mazor 2004 the good correlations of formation waters with the seawater evaporation trajectory in na vs cl and br vs cl mccaffrey et al 1987 suggest that they might originate from seawater evaporation fig 5 short of halite precipitation the constituents of formation water were further modified by diagenetic interaction sulfate reduction and water rock interaction the ca enrichment and mg depletion can be seen from the deviations of ca cl and mg cl relations compared with the seawater evaporation trajectory fig 5 the 94 depletion of mg cl mass ratio and 72 enrichment of ca cl mass ratios compared with the evaporated seawater suggest dolomitization of carbonate rocks with the sufficient mg in the evaporated seawater warner et al 2012 mccaffrey et al 1987 haluszczak et al 2013 the nearly complete loss of k from 0 05 to 2 4 mg l k content of 379 mg l for seawater indicates the reaction with low k clay minerals to produce k rich clays such as illite illite smectite and illite account for 96 of total clay minerals of the s1l shale in the study area liu et al 2017 and k feldspar stueber and walter 1991 kharaka and hanor 2014 pfws present boron isotopic compositions δ11b with values ranging from 23 9 to 26 1 and the b cl mass ratio ranging from 0 20 10 3 to 0 21 10 3 the ratio is slightly less than seawater of 0 24 10 3 pfws are depleted in 11b relative to seawater δ11b 39 0 and or evaporated seawater δ11b 39 0 54 7 vengosh et al 1992 similar characteristics of formation water have been reported from the marcellus marine shale formation in the appalachian basin united states δ11b 31 33 warner et al 2014 and flowback and produced waters in the weiyuan shale gasfield δ11b ranging from 22 5 to 33 5 with average of 26 9 in sichuan basin china ni et al 2018 both below seawater or evaporated seawater the phenomenon of low δ11b relative to evaporated seawater was interpreted as the original evaporated seawater modified by subsequent isotopic fractionation during a reaction with the clay minerals such as boron incorporation into the crystal lattice 11b is preferentially incorporated into the clays during the transformation of illite smectite williams et al 2001 warner et al 2014 rather than adsorption on the clay surface resulting in lower b cl and higher δ11b values this is consistent with the mineral composition of shale in the study area minerals in the s1l shale are dominated by quartz 43 for average and clay minerals 36 a few carbonate minerals plagioclase and pyrite table s2 the clay minerals are mainly the illite smectite 58 and illite 38 liu et al 2017 the 87sr 86sr ratios of formation water 0 723966 0 724132 are higher than the silurian seawater at the time of the sedimentation of the shale materials 0 7077 0 7088 burke et al 1982 it is also higher than those of flowback and produced waters 0 716627 0 720248 in the weiyuan shale gasfield and produced water 0 708102 0 715239 in conventional oil gas field in sichuan basin china ni et al 2018 but are reasonably lower than the bulk host shale 0 740246 0 740248 table s2 this implies that more radiogenic 87sr results from the differences of the reaction kinetics of mineral dissolution frost and toner 2004 shand et al 2009 and that the solute 87sr 86sr is in disequilibrium with the whole rock the high value of 87sr 86sr for the s1l shale is consistent with the results from ma et al 2017 when comparing with produced waters in the weiyuan shale gasfiled with the same shale formation in the sichuan basin ni et al 2018 the pfws in the fuling gasfield have higher cl concentration salinity and 87sr 86sr but lower br cl and nacl this may further suggest that our produced water is the end member of the shale authentic formation water without mixing with any fracturing fluids the undetected so4 no3 and no2 indicate the strong reducing and closed environment in pfw the existence of pyrite with content of 3 5 in shale formation table s2 also confirms the reducing environment for formation water in this environment sulfate reduction usually occurs a lack of so4 and a low content of hco3 facilitate the high concentrations of alkaline earth elements e g sr ba in the formation water haluszczak et al 2013 kharaka and hanor 2014 simultaneously the water rock interaction leads to the increased concentrations of sr and ba similarly other metals like mn li cu zn rb fe and rare earth elements which are 31 and 21 413 times the concentration of evaporated seawater based on sr br and ba br ratios the ba contents range from 611 to 908 mg l while sr contents range from 447 to 542 mg l in the pfw table 1 the δ13c dic values in the pfw are as high as 13 6 to 16 2 with hco3 contents of 300 380 mg l table 1 the normal processes of rainfall infiltration and dissolution with shale minerals average δ13c of 1 5 table s2 cannot account for the high δ13c dic value of formation water positive δ13c values of dic co2 are always a clear indication of methanogenesis co2 ch4 in this case where 12c is preferentially allocated into the methane and the remaining co2 and hence dic gets progressively enriched in 13c clark and fritz 1997 the isotopic equilibrium value for δ13c dic would be 25 4 at a shale formation temperature of approximately 80 c which is reasonable compared with the measured value of 13 6 to 16 2 this rare phenomenon was also observed in the st lawrence lowlands where δ13c dic can be up to 31 6 clark and fritz 1997 the ch4 contents in the pfws range from 0 70 to 1 24 mg l the relatively low values may be caused by the water and gas separation processes at the shale gas wellhead the δ13c ch4 of the dissolved gas in the pfws is approximately 30 4 which is within the ranges for the shale gas ch4 composition 28 4 to 31 0 in the fuling gasfield wei et al 2016 suggesting that the dissolved ch4 in pfw is mainly derived from the thermocatalytic methane of shale gas most of the formation waters in marine sedimentary rocks were considered to be connate seawater in origin prior to the use of isotopes white et al 1963 haluszczak et al 2013 kharaka and hanor 2014 use of water isotopes and other tracers formation waters can be derived from holocene meteoric water kharaka and thordsen 1992 such as qusaiba hot shale in the northern exploration area saudi arabia 6000 and 6700 years bp birkle 2016 or from old meteoric water kharaka and carothers 1986 or from connate evaporated seawater knauth and beeunas 1986 particularly in deep sea pelagic and hemipelagic sediments in this case water isotopes can also be modified by water rock interaction and or from mixture of different waters with different age or of different origin and age kharaka and carothers 1986 including fresh meteoric water the water stable isotopes of shale formation water in the fuling gasfield show limited variation average value of 1 3 for δ18o and 27 4 for δ2h and lie to the right of the meteoric water line fig 6 the values are in the range of produced waters in the weiyuan shale gasfield and it was suggested that the evaporated seawater was diluted with meteoric water ni et al 2018 because our authentic formation waters are free of 3h and 14c and na cl and br cl are similar with seawater we assumed that the shale formation water has originated from evaporated seawater short of halite precipitation and diluted with fossil meteoric water age older than 40 ka based on undetected 14c assuming that the seawater was evaporated 4 times then the cl and δ18o would be 76000 mg l and 10 if the evaporated seawater was mixed with the fresh meteoric water the fresh meteoric water δ18o value would approximately be 10 suggesting that the dilution rate is 2 then the cl would be 38000 mg l close to the produced formation water average value of 38756 mg l considering all possible dilution conditions for δ18o and cl the δ18o value of end member for fresh meteoric water would be lower than that of modern groundwater fig 6 this implies that the fossil meteoric water mixing end member was recharged during water during colder climate periods relative to modern conditions clark and fritz 1997 kharaka and hanor 2014 birkle 2016 the other less likely explanation for the depleted heavy isotope δ18o and δ2h of formation water is that the connate water was totally displaced by meteoric water which had undergone evaporation δ18o and δ2h value deviated from meteoric water line and increased compared with initial meteoric water or and water rock interaction resulting in δ18o shift only δ18o increased fig 6 the temperature for the s1l shale reservoir at depth of 2283 2484 m is 79 86 c cpcc 2014 at the condition of a low ratio of water and rock and long residence time the δ18o shift can occur even in low medium temperature qin et al 2005 pang et al 2019 however because the s1l shale formed in a deep seawater shelf depositional environment and was very compact low porosity and permeability cpcc 2014 li et al 2014 the connate seawater is less likely to be totally displaced by other water including meteoric water therefore the authentic formation water from the s1l shale is most likely to originate from evaporated seawater and be mixed with meteoric water 4 2 geochemical characteristics of shallow groundwater the shallow groundwater is typical karst groundwater derived from meteoric water fig 6 with tds ranging from 146 to 402 mg l average 267 mg l and with hco3 ca and hco3 ca mg water chemistry types fig 4 the cl 0 9 to 32 mg l with an average of 5 0 mg l and trace element contents are very low compared with those of the pfw table 1 the mass ratio of na cl ranges from 0 10 to 1 22 with an average of 0 39 and br cl ranges from 0 0043 to 0 0178 with an average of 0 0111 the br cl of shallow groundwater is higher than the formation water based on a previous study li et al 2016b the shallow groundwaters have tritium contents ranging from 6 5 to 8 6 tu suggesting a young age of the groundwater and quick circulation for this karst shallow groundwater the 87sr 86sr ratios of shallow groundwater 0 707884 0 709362 table 1 overlapped with the value of the carbonate of aquifer 0 708026 0 709487 table s2 the 87sr 86sr ratios of shallow groundwater are significantly lower than shale formation water the sr concentration ranges from 0 09 to 1 38 mg l the δ11b 12 1 to 14 2 and b cl molar ratios 2 9 10 3 to 10 8 10 3 are all within the values of global meteoric freshwaters lemarchand et al 2002 warner et al 2014 as expected the methane contents for shallow groundwater in the fuling gasfield are all less than 0 01 mg l table 1 while the defined action level for hazard mitigation recommended by the us office of the interior is 10 28 mg l eltschlager et al 2001 the detected δ13c ch4 for the shallow groundwater the mass contents are also below 0 01 mg l ranges from 74 4 to 49 1 suggesting biogenic origin however the relatively high value 49 1 for sample w25 could be biogenic methane that has undergone methane oxidation which leads to an increase in δ13c ch4 barker and fritz 1981 the geochemical and isotopic characteristics of shallow groundwater are consistent with the baseline water quality investigation with respective to shale gas development li et al 2016b 4 3 determination of sensitive monitoring indicators the sensitive monitoring indicators are significantly important to assess and trace potential groundwater contamination caused by shale gas development based on the details given in section 2 formation water is the important end member to identify the potential monitoring indicators when the dissolved inorganic constituents and specific isotopic compositions for pfw are always significantly different from shallow groundwater sensitive monitoring indicators can be obtained through end member analysis there is a random variation for a specific ion or and its isotopic composition for a natural groundwater system without any contamination a random value of the ion content or and its isotopic composition would lie in the range of average value 3σ with a probability of 99 7 pauta criterion where σ is the standard deviation if one groundwater is contaminated by mixing with x produced formation water pfw in this case the relevant ions and isotopic compositions in this contaminated groundwater would change δ for ions δ ion c p f w x c sg 1 x c sg c p f w x c sg x for isotope e g δ11b δ13c ε sr sw δ2h and δ18o δ iso c p f w r pfw x c sg r sg 1 x c p f w x c sg 1 x r sg where c is the average concentration for specific ions in produced formation water pfw and in shallow groundwater sg and r is isotopic value if the change δ is equal to 3σ then the x is considered as the threshold value to cause changes in ion or and isotope ratio of shallow groundwater by contamination and then chemical compatibility is considered for the mixing process between formation water and shallow groundwater the result fig 7 shows that less than 0 05 of produced formation water mixed with 99 95 of shallow groundwater would result in statistical increases of ba 0 006 ε sr sw 0 008 li 0 012 δ11b 0 03 na 0 03 cl 0 035 br 0 041 and nh4 0 049 for shallow groundwater b and sr content would be measured when using its isotope however during the mixing process it is possible to precipitate solid solutions from supersaturated conditions using mix of geochemical model phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 when 0 006 of produced formation water mixed with 99 994 of shallow groundwater the ba content of the mixture will increase from 26 μg l to 78 μg l with statistical significance compared with shallow groundwater at the stage the saturation indices si of barite baso4 is 0 30 suggesting that barite is undersaturated and ba would not precipitate until barite reaches equilibrium state i e si 0 with the mixing ratio reaching 0 015 and content reaching 156 μg l 6 times higher than the content of shallow groundwater table 2 this demonstrates that ba is a robust indicator to trace mixing process in addition in few cases an actual control of solutes by equilibrium with a mineral can be demonstrated and then the saturation state merely indicates in which direction the processes may go for subsaturation dissolution is expected and supersaturation suggests precipitation shen et al 1993 drever 1988 appelo and postma 2005 for example the contaminated shallow groundwater csg w and csg d has si barite of 0 46 and 0 44 with the ba content of 714 μg l and 426 μg l at supersaturation state table 2 the nh4 can be easily oxidized into no3 during mixing process with shallow oxidized groundwater which is not inert and sensitive na cl and br are inert tracers and only precipitate at very higher salinity the other tracers including sr ε sr sw and b δ11b are relatively chemically compatible at low mixing ratios ppw sw and the contents are all lower than the contaminated shallow groundwater table 2 this means that less than 0 05 of pfw mixed with sgw caused by contamination can even be recognized using the defined multiple tracers like ba ε sr sw li δ11b na cl and br in the fuling gasfield which can be regarded as sensitive monitoring indicators and be analyzed as a priority during groundwater monitoring for example assuming b and sr behave conservatively si strontianite 1 26 which is a reasonable assumption a mixture of 0 05 pfw mixed with 99 95 shallow groundwater in this situation shallow groundwater should be contaminated would result in an average 3 9 increase in δ11b 92 0 increase in ε sr sw fig 8 this would also result in obviously increase in concentration of these dissolved constituents using mix of geochemical model phreeqc with equilibrium phase of barite for b 54 br 60 sr 76 cl 414 ba 517 na 603 and li 1438 fig 5 fig 9 in addition the ion ratio such as b cl br cl and sr ca also show the differences between formation water and shallow groundwater fig 10 and can be used to trace shallow groundwater contamination however conventional monitoring indicators conducted by the local environmental protection bureau such as ph compounds of nitrogen no3 no2 and nh4 codmn and major ions are not sensitive or practical for assessing the impact of shale gas development on the groundwater environment for example even at 1 pfw entering shallow groundwater the contributions of codmn 1 2 mg l to shallow groundwater is not obvious and can also be covered up by the natural random variation for example the maximum codmn content in shallow groundwater is 2 9 mg l and the average value is 1 1 mg l table 1 in addition compounds of nitrogen and codmn in shallow groundwater can be easily affected by natural biogeochemistry processes agricultural activities and domestic sewage li et al 2016b huang et al 2019 previous studies have extensively studied the characteristics of flowback fluids and produced water for example hayes 2009 conducted extensive measurements of flowback fluids and produced water including general chemistry metals semi volatile organic compounds organophosphorus pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs however it is noted that pesticides pcbs and a large fraction of the semi volatile constituents should be considered to be unnecessary for the sampling and analysis of flowback fluids because of the very low concentration in flowback fluids and produced water other tracers such as major elements li et al 2016a 87sr 86sr chapman et al 2012 zheng et al 2017 δ11b and δ7li warner et al 2014 harkness et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 have also been used for identifying the produced water of hydraulic fracturing however this study has relatively systematically demonstrated the framework to figure out sensitive indicators for tracing groundwater contamination leakage from saline flowback fluids and produced water during shale gas development when the theoretical framework is compatible the specific monitoring indicators are changeable among different sites furthermore regulators suggesting rules for environmental monitoring often have costs in mind this study demonstrated that some simple and relatively cheap chemical parameters such as br cl na li ba concentrations can be effective in tracing leakage of saline fluids therefore routine monitoring can include those parameters when there is potential contamination trend or and abnormal values the isotopes such as 87sr 86sr δ11b δ7li and even other non traditional stable isotopes can be further used to trace the contamination and to confirm whether it is related to shale gas development when the aforementioned sensitive inorganic monitoring indicators can be used to identify produced formation water in shallow groundwater at a very small portion some ions can also reach the threshold of drinking water causing shallow groundwater quality to deteriorate this portion can be as small as 0 08 for ba chemical compatibility is not considered here for safety this means that 1 m3 produced formation water can pollute 1200 m3 shallow groundwater in the fuling gasfield which cannot be suitable to drink anymore therefore this produced water should be carefully disposed of 4 4 tracing shallow groundwater contamination we found one karst spring with unusual water chemistry and isotopic composition when compared with the regional normal shallow groundwater this spring is located in a lower reach of a shale gas pad with a distance of 70 m to a wastewater pond near the pad the pond was constructed using concrete and the bottom and the sides of the pond were cemented the pond has been used to store flowback fluids and produced water from the pad the tds of this contaminated shallow groundwater csg was 674 788 mg l which is much higher than baseline shallow groundwater samples from the area 146 402 mg l the cl hco3 na ca type of contaminated water indicated a mixing of pfw and shallow groundwater fig 4 in addition the sensitive and diagnostic indexes such as cl vs br cl vs na li vs ba were in the mixing line of the shallow groundwater and pfw fig 5 and fig 9 the chemical characteristics indicated that the shallow groundwater samples were contaminated by pfw and this was further verified by isotopic signatures 87sr 86sr and δ11b the contaminated groundwater with a high ε sr sw value of 124 4 and sr concentration 1 57 1 81 mg l deviated from the baseline shallow groundwater with a low ε sr sw value from 18 1 to 2 7 and low sr concentration 0 09 1 38 mg l the contaminated groundwater ε sr sw values and sr concentrations were in the range of shallow groundwater and pfw ε sr sw 208 7 to 211 0 sr 499 542 mg l for pfw fig 8 the contaminated groundwater had a higher δ11b value 21 2 21 5 when compared with baseline shallow groundwater samples δ11b value ranging from 12 1 to 14 2 the δ11b and b cl 0 69 0 82 10 3 molar ratio of the contaminated groundwater was also in the mixing line of shallow groundwater and pfw however the ch4 content of the contaminated shallow groundwater was less than 0 01 mg l and then δ13c ch4 was not detected compared with sr b and cl water stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h were less sensitive to the mixing of pfw and shallow groundwater fig 6 this lack of apparent isotopic shift of contaminated shallow groundwater may indicate that the mixing ratio was too small to measure changes in δ18o and δ2h the minimum required proportion of pfw is at least 25 in order to detect δ18o and δ2h changes normally in this case the percentage of formation water in the contaminated shallow groundwater can be estimated from the pfw as an end member which is the main source of dissolved solutes for flowback fluids and or produced water assuming cl br b and sr behave conservatively the mixing ratio can be quantified based on isotopes and conservative solute mass balances assuming the mixing ratio for formation water pfw into shallow groundwater sg is x which would result in contaminated shallow groundwater csg for isotopes i e δ11b and ε sr sw the x is given by x c c s g r csg c sg r sg c p f w r pfw c sg r sg for conservative ions i e cl and br the x is given by x c c s g c sg c p f w c sg where c is the average concentration for a specific ion in produced formation water pfw shallow groundwater sg and contaminated shallow groundwater csg and r is the isotopic value the results show that the pfw was 0 2 0 9 of the contaminated shallow groundwater table 3 based on the average values both for shallow groundwater and produced formation water the contamination caused significant increases in cl na ba and li the cl and ba contents have exceeded the threshold of the standard for drinking water quality of china gb5749 2006 and therefore this drinking water source has been abandoned the robust geochemical and isotopic evidence shows that the shallow groundwater contamination is related to shale gas development the breakthrough pressure of the cap rock for the target shale stratum is as high as 64 5 70 4 mpa at 80 c and the thickness of the regional cap rock is 600 700 m cpcc 2014 therefore the deep formation water cannot extend to the shallow karst aquifer in the study area due to the thick shale cap rock two possible mechanisms may be responsible for the observed contamination first poor shale gas well integrity may be responsible for contamination because this issue occurs in 1 10 of conventional oil and gas wells stuart 2012 jackson et al 2013b vidic et al 2013 ingraffea et al 2014 and unconventional oil and gas wells may have more integrity issues rahm and riha 2014 ingraffea et al 2014 however there is no evidence to show the imperfectly sealed shale gas well around the pad based on site conditions a second source of contamination may be from wastewater pond leaks based on site investigation the contaminated groundwater spring is located in the downstream of groundwater flow direction around a shale gas pad and only approximately 70 m close to a wastewater pond after the wastewater pond was abandoned the water quality of the spring has been improved since april 2017 the results show that the concentrations of diagnostic indexes had decreased from 426 to 714 to 166 μg l for ba from 423 to 450 to 18 3 μg l for li from 150 to 173 to 24 7 mg l for na from 278 to 288 mg l to 42 mg l for cl and from 1 28 to 1 38 mg l to 0 31 mg l for br respectively table s1 therefore leakage from the waste water pond is suspected although the contamination processes or pathways cannot be verified in this high heterogeneity and anisotropy karst aquifer this study has confirmed that groundwater contamination has occurred related to shale gas development it has also confirmed that the determined sensitive inorganic monitoring indicators can be used to trace groundwater contamination aqueous phase related to shale gas development in addition while most studies have shown that even at the first weeks after hydraulic fracturing there is about 5 50 of formation water in flowback fluids hayes 2009 warner et al 2014 birkle 2016 kondash et al 2017 ni et al 2018 osselin et al 2018 mainly using cl and water isotopes this study shows that 0 05 of formation water mixed with shallow groundwater can cause contamination and suggests that the method can also trace contamination from leakage of flowback fluids in the first weeks after hydraulic fracturing i e even 1 of flowback fluids in shallow groundwater can be identified in the fuling gasfield however specific flowback fluids cannot be determined 5 conclusions geochemical and isotopic compositions of produced authentic formation water suggest that pfw in the fuling gasfield might originate from evaporated seawater modified by water rock interactions and be mixed with fresh meteoric water the significant differences in geochemical and specific isotopic compositions between pfw and shallow groundwater make it possible to figure out the sensitive indicators and diagnostic indexes to trace or identify potential groundwater contamination caused by flowback fluids and produced water leakage of shale gas development the determined indicators can be analyzed as a priority for baseline water quality investigation and in routine monitoring programmes during shale gas development the study in the fuling gasfield in sw china shows that geochemical such as ba li na cl br b sr br cl b cl sr ca and isotopic signatures such as δ11b and ε sr sw are sensitive for detecting the contamination of fresh water from flowback fluids and produced water leakage during shale gas development even in small proportions this actual groundwater contamination case has confirmed the effectiveness of the method therefore those indicators could be included in the current routine monitoring project the findings of this study could improve the shallow groundwater monitoring programme in shale gas
