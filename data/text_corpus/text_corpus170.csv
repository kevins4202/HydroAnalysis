estimates are known to vary depending on the quality and fidelity of the original images the precision of the segmentation processes and appropriateness of the implemented measurement algorithms porter and wildenschild 2010 schlüter et al 2014 an important characteristic of flow in unsaturated porous media is the capillary pressure saturation relationship the connection between capillary pressure and fluid fluid interfacial curvature expressed by the young laplace y l equation opens new avenues of exploration in pore scale imaging and image analysis in the young laplace equation 1 p c σ 1 r 1 1 r 2 2 k m e a n σ pc is capillary pressure r 1 and r 2 are the two orthogonal principal radii of curvature kmean is mean interfacial curvature and σ is interfacial tension two fundamentally different approaches exist for estimating the interface curvature from image data 1 a voxel based approach that uses the image intensity gradient however curvature estimation using this method is associated with various limitations and is highly sensitive to image quality bullard et al 1995 thirion and gourdon 1995 2 a surface based approach introduced by armstrong et al 2012a that uses a triangulated surface generated from the segmented images to estimate curvature the most commonly adopted approach for surface generation is the marching cubes algorithm lorensen and cline 1987 although the surface based approach is becoming more frequently used armstrong et al 2012b armstrong and wildenschild 2012 andrew et al 2014 armstrong et al 2014 singh et al 2016 and garing et al 2017 curvature estimates remain sensitive to various issues such as the amount of smoothing segmentation accuracy and image pixelation e g armstrong et al 2012a and garing et al 2017 recent attempts to improve the accuracy of curvature estimation have mainly focused on image quality garing et al 2017 for instance reported that variation in curvatures seen at 2x resolution 3 28 µm voxels was absent at 4x resolution 1 62 µm voxels for their glass bead samples yet for their sandstone rock samples there was variation in curvatures for disconnected phase at both the 2x and 4x resolutions two very recent studies by herring et al 2017 and singh et al 2017 employ techniques similar to what is presented here herring et al based their approach directly on the work presented here while singh et al applied dilation by a fixed number of voxels of their rock surfaces to achieve a similar approach to what we achieve with a percentage clipping of the interface near the solid surface instead of focusing on increased image resolution this paper introduces a more accurate method for curvature estimation the improved algorithm is validated against synthetic data and real cmt data sets using measured capillary pressure values from a multi phase flow drainage imbibition experiment finally the new method is used to gain insights into the evolution of the capillary pressure of a disconnected nonwetting phase trapped within a porous medium 2 materials and methods this section describes the different image processing approaches used for curvature estimation and the experimental and synthetic data sets used for verification and testing of the new method 2 1 experimental data sets the first numerical data set discussed is a series of computer generated images of interface menisci within capillary tubes of different radii these analytical configurations were used to validate the new curvature algorithm and quantify curvature estimation error a hemisphere was generated within a column in order to create a perfect concave meniscus then a grey scale image was generated and the image analyzed using the same method as for cmt obtained images for these computer generated data sets the theoretical mean curvature values for each data set is known calculated as the reciprocal of the radius the second real cmt data set was collected at the advanced photon source argonne national laboratory the experimental system consisted of water wet glass beads with a ratio of 35 0 6 mm diameter 35 0 8 mm diameter and 30 1 0 1 4 mm diameter packed into a 25 0 mm long glass column with an inside radius of 3 5 mm porter et al 2010 armstrong et al 2012a the two phases used were soltrol 220 non wetting phase ρ 0 79 g cm3 σ 0 0378 n m and potassium iodide doped water wetting phase 1 6 mass ratio of ki h2o density 1 17 g ml the non wetting phase was connected to the top of the column and the wetting phase was connected to the bottom of the column a semi permeable hydrophilic membrane was placed at the bottom of the column to prevent the non wetting phase from entering the water path pressure transducers connected to the oil and water lines and referenced to the top of the sample were used to externally record capillary pressures as the difference between wetting and nonwetting phase pressures wetting phase volume was controlled to 1 µl by a syringe pump gilson 402 the system was first fully saturated with wetting phase followed by primary drainage pd which nearly saturated the bead pack with oil then main imbibition mi main drainage md secondary imbibition si and secondary drainage sd all referring to the wetting phase for each drainage or imbibition a varying but precise µl amount of wetting phase was pumped out of drainage or into imbibition the system at a flow rate of 0 6 ml h in a number of incremental steps about 15 min were required for the fluids to reach quasi equilibrium after each saturation change we define quasi equilibrium as a state where significant progress towards equilibrium has been made on a time scale of minutes but where complete equilibrium is not expected to be achieved for many hours gray et al 2015 and schlüter et al 2017 quasi equilibrium was verified by checking the images if fluids were still moving during the scan the resulting images would be blurry if that was the case the sample would be rescanned after another 15 min wait period x ray cmt images were obtained from a 5 5 mm section of the column at 13 µm voxel resolution all of the two dimensional radiographs were preprocessed and reconstructed using algorithms developed by geosoilenviro consortium for advanced radiation sources gsecars rivers et al 1999 to produce 3d volumes of data additional details about the experimental setup can be found in porter et al 2010 2 2 image processing all image processing was accomplished using the commercial software program avizo fire segmentation is a necessary and crucial step that allows for subsequent accurate data analysis and obviously relies heavily on the fidelity of the greyscale images generally greyscale images are noisy and depending on how significant the noise is it can negatively affect the quality of image segmentation hence image filtering is commonly employed as a first step in image analysis all the greyscale images in this work were subject to non local means filtering to remove noise and blur and then segmented using a watershed algorithm to render each phase to consist of a single label field 2 2 1 non local means filter because of the particle nature of synchrotron light shot noise random variations in brightness is prevalent in photon counting optical devices and x ray based images are therefore inherently noisy due to its efficiency at noise removal buades et al 2005 we applied a non local means filter to the greyscale images based on trial the search window local neighborhood and similarity value which define the window size the importance of each voxel in the window and weighting factor respectively were set to 4 7 and 3 voxels as shown in fig 1 it was challenging to identify peaks and valleys in the original greyscale histogram however after applying the non local means filter most of the noise is removed leading to a sharper histogram with distinct peaks representing oil water and beads and an image that is much more homogeneous and significantly easier to segment 2 2 2 segmentation image segmentation is the process of classifying or dividing an image into different regions of voxels with similar greyscale intensity thus the main goal of segmentation is to identify and convert a greyscale image into a simpler labeled image that is ready for subsequent analyses for segmentation of the data presented here we adopted the watershed segmentation as described by vincent et al 1991 a recent study by schlüter et al 2014 compared various segmentation methods and concluded that the watershed algorithm was among the best for segmenting datasets of two phase flow in porous media a scan of the dry bead pack was used to identify the solid phase which could then be superimposed on all other greyscale images relative to the analysis of armstrong et al 2012a in the present analysis we also fixed some minor and very local segmentation artifacts using the watershed approach the known regions in the data were initially identified by using a simple threshold next the unknown transition regions consisting of the points at the inflection between the two known phases are allocated to one of the phases by analyzing the image intensity gradient eventually the transitional regions will be minimized by the watershed module and labeled such that the 64 000 greyscale values are sorted into only 3 classes oil water and beads connected and disconnected wetting and non wetting phases were distinguished using markers this algorithm retrieves voxels in the image that are connected to a marker by using a 26 neighborhood connectivity requirement a marker for connected non wetting phase was placed on the top of the image the oil reservoir was physically connected to the top of the sample and a marker for connected wetting phase was placed at the bottom of the image connected to the water reservoir therefore the two fluid phases could be parsed into four configurations connected wetting connected non wetting disconnected wetting and disconnected non wetting the interface between the connected wetting phase and the connected non wetting phase exerts a capillary pressure that can be measured by an externally placed pressure transducer the connected phases therefore provide a basis for comparison between image based estimates of capillary pressure and externally measured capillary pressures in contrast pressure of disconnected phases can not be measured externally therefore accurately quantifying the interface geometry of disconnected fluid phases from tomographic images also provides us unprecedented insight into disconnected phase dynamics 2 3 surface generation three dimensional surface generation was accomplished with the marching cubes algorithm lorensen and cline 1987 which approximates a smoothed interface between different phases using thousands of triangles the number of triangles depends on the resolution of the input images i e higher resolution results in more triangles once the image is segmented and labeled the surface generation module in avizo can be applied with different smoothing settings type and extent the surface generation module provides two smoothing options constrained and unconstrained smoothing constrained smoothing guarantees that no label is altered during surface generation any two voxel centers that have been labeled differently before the smoothing are separated by the generated surface afterwards this is not necessarily the case for every small detail in the unconstrained case and is therefore not considered in this work smoothing extent was studied in detail due to its parabolic characteristics and because selection of an appropriate value involves some trade off higher smoothing extent does not necessarily result in an improved i e more accurate interface through careful evaluation of test spheres and capillary tubes we found that constrained smoothing using a gaussian filter with a smoothing extent of 3 voxels preserves the characteristics of the original data and provides adequate smoothing of the interface which allows for greatest accuracy in the subsequent data analysis in the interest of conciseness the details of this separate investigation is not included here we refer to li 2015 for further details about the smoothing process 2 4 curvature calculation for a two dimensional system curvature is the inverse of the radius of an infinitely closely inscribed circle at a given point in a three dimensional shape the normal vector and tangent vector are used to define the plane on which the curvature is calculated fig 2 all curves with the same tangent vector occupy the same normal vector taking into account all possible curvatures at a point on a surface the maximum and minimum curvature values are called the principal curvatures k 1 and k2 respectively the mean curvature is then used to calculate capillary pressures by the young laplace equation eq 1 the mean curvature is defined as half the sum of the principal curvatures kmean k1 k2 2 while the gaussian curvature which is the product of the principal curvatures k1 k2 can also been used to extract details of interfacial geometry it is not relevant for estimation of capillary pressures capillary pressures estimated from surface based curvature calculations suffer from errors introduced by limited image resolution along the triple line and physicochemical interactions near solid surfaces no matter the image data size and resolution the edge of the interface where oil and water connects near the solid surface will be rough and this generates inaccurate curvature estimates in this region fig 3 armstrong et al 2012a dealt with this problem by eliminating all positive curvatures values when calculating mean curvature method 2 in table 1 in this study we propose a different methodology to increase the accuracy of the mean curvature estimate the triangles that are close to the solid surface should either be given lower weight when generating the mean estimate or be entirely eliminated from consideration based on their proximity to the solid surface by doing so mean curvature is estimated based primarily on segments of the interface that are not affected by their proximity to the solid surface each triangle is defined by three vertices as shown in fig 4 a to accomplish this we measure the shortest distance between each triangle s vertex and the solid surface fig 4b the vertex distance calculation was performed based on dijkstra s shortest edge distance algorithm dijkstra 1959 the shortest edge distance of a triangle is calculated as the average of its three shortest vertex distances following the argument above we introduce two new approaches that eliminate the effect of the solid surface on the curvature estimates 2 4 1 distance weighting the shortest edge distance for each triangle is used as a weight factor to improve curvature calculations by assigning more weight to triangles far from the solid surface and less to those that may be affected by the solid surface see method 3 in table 1 this so called distance weighted mean curvature value for the interface km dw is estimated based on the following equation 2 k m d w i n k i d i i n d i where the curvature value for each triangle ki is multiplied by the triangle s respective shortest edge distance di 2 4 2 surface modification curvature estimates can also be improved by modifying the surface a triangle is eliminated the surface is clipped if it is considered too close to the edge solid surface by determining if the shortest edge distance value is less than a chosen threshold dmin as an example assume a threshold of 9 5 voxels and two triangles with vertex distance values as shown in fig 5 in this case the triangle on the left meets the requirement and will be preserved whereas the one on the right is eliminated from further consideration mean curvature and distance values for the preserved triangles are then used for generating surface modified mean curvature histograms method 4 in table 1 3 k m s m k 1 k 2 2 f o r d i d m i n combining the distance weighted and surface modification methods method 5 in table 1 yields eq 4 4 k m d w s m i n k i d i i n d i f o r d i d m i n the surface modification approach was validated using as a model a numerically generated interface associated with a synthetic capillary tube with an internal radius of 50 voxels the theoretical mean curvature value of this meniscus is 0 02 voxel 1 indicated by the red vertical line in fig 6 a after testing of a range of threshold values the shortest edge distance threshold dmin was set to 20 in this case 20 of the 50 voxel radius an example of the surface modification achieved using this approach is illustrated in fig 6b and ultimately the successful match with the externally measured transducer pressures confirms this choice the resulting histograms for unmodified and modified interfaces fig 6a illustrates that the curvature value after surface modification clusters more narrowly around the theoretical value but more importantly the more positive values that are influenced by the solid surface have been successfully eliminated for the real cmt data discussed later the threshold was set to 20 percent of the maximum distance value for each data set conceptually equivalent to 20 of a pore radii in a very recent paper singh et al 2017 used a similar approach by dilating the rock surfaces near the solid surface to eliminate interface voxels affected by the solid surface however they set their cufoff threshold to a fixed value of 4 voxels as they found that any further dilation affected the curvature values in a negative way this is likely because they are working with rock samples with much finer features than the glass bead data used in this study which contains larger pores and interfaces relative to the voxel resolution and therefore leaves sufficient curvature behind after a percentage clipping to facilitate reliable curvature estimation herring et al 2017 used an approach that follows our algorithm in terms of eliminating curvature measurements near the solid surface and assigning higher weights to curvature measurements farther away from the solid surface to achieve the desired accuracy for their more complex geometry bentheimer sandstone with pore sizes approaching the image resolution they included sub voxel precise registration of the euclidian distance map of the dry image to their partially saturated volumes both the segmented and grey scale images 3 results 3 1 testing the new curvature estimation method the synthetic data set menisci in capillary tubes of different radii was used to test the accuracy of the five different methods described earlier and listed in table 1 because curvature estimation becomes tenuous for very small features we expect to see significant improvement in the curvature estimates for larger radii tubes the percentage errors listed in fig 7 are calculated as 5 p e r c e n t a g e e r r o r m e a s u r e d v a l u e t h e o r e t i c a l v a l u e t h e o r e t i c a l v a l u e it should be noted here that for a synthetic image units do not really make sense and the units can be referred to as voxels or microns interchangeably the results in fig 7 show that for the smallest capillary tube r 10 voxels all methods introduce 9 or more error however as soon as the tube radius increases we see a decrease in the error with increasing sophistication of the estimation method for methods 1 and 2 i e using the entire data set or negative values only respectively the error remains at 6 or more regardless of the size of the capillary tube implementing the distance weighted algorithm method 3 reduces the maximum error to below 5 for a radius of 25 μm and approaches 1 5 for the largest tube the surface modification method 4 generates curvature estimates that are below 5 error at a capillary tube radius of 20 μm and improves considerably to only 3 error for the maximum radius tested and finally by combining distance weighting with surface modification method 5 the decrease in error with increasing tube size is further enhanced ending up at only 0 02 for the 55 mm tube clearly combining these two new curvature estimation methods results in vast improvement over existing methods while the error calculated for a specific pore size decreases with increasing radii natural porous media will present to the fluid a distribution of pore sizes therefore a characteristic accuracy for each method when applied to a media consisting of variously sized pores is here calculated by the slope of the linear correlation between theoretical and measured curvatures across all pore sizes tested fig 8 note that a slope less than 1 signifies that all methods tend towards underestimating the curvature as the methods march from 1 through 5 the slope approaches unity thereby indicating improvement in accuracy with increasing sophistication of the estimation method having successfully completed this method validation we used the improved curvature estimation approach method 5 table 1 to analyze curvatures for the real cmt data set described earlier porter et al 2010 converting curvature estimates to capillary pressure pc via the young laplace equation then comparing this image based pc to pc measured using external pressure transducers in a previous study armstrong et al 2012a analyzed the data set from porter et al 2010 and demonstrated that by considering only connected fluid interfaces and eliminating positive curvature values from consideration transducer based capillary pressure and curvature based capillary pressure agreed surprisingly well for imbibition however the image based measurement underestimated pc relative to the transducer measurements for drainage armstrong et al proposed two different reasons for this discrepancy 1 short equilibration time and 2 inaccurate curvature measurement in the following we recalculate the curvatures for the same dataset using our new method method 5 in table 1 convert these to pc values eq 1 σ 0 0378 n m as in porter et al 2010 and compare the outcome with the results of armstrong et al 2012a the improved curvature based capillary pressure estimates show very favorable agreement with the transducer based capillary pressures much improved over the data of armstrong et al 2012a b fig 9 the new data set was also used to investigate the evolution of menisci curvatures for the connected water phase as saturation changed during imbibition as more water enters the sample through the bottom port and oil is pushed out of the system through the top port menisci curvatures shift towards more positive values corresponding to lower pc whereas for drainage the exact opposite behavior is observed see supporting information si 1 and si 2 thus there are no surprises in terms of interpretation of the connected phase behavior 3 2 capillary pressures of disconnected phases the accuracy gained in predicting fluid capillary pressures from curvatures facilitates the computation of liquid pressure of disconnected fluid components disconnected oil blobs this has not been achieved before as there has been no mechanism available for measuring the pressure state of disconnected blobs inside a three dimensional porous medium during main imbibition mi as water imbibes into the oil filled media blobs of oil remain that become disconnected from the bulk oil phase fig 10 shows how capillary pressure and curvature evolves for the interface between disconnected oil blobs and connected water phase for a select number of points on the imbibition curve the full imbibition cycle for disconnected phase is presented in si 3 a number of interesting features are evident in the data during imbibition the average pressure of the disconnected phase calculated via interfacial curvatures is consistently higher than the bulk connected phase measured by transducer moving from left to right in fig 10 as water saturation increases more interface is established between connected water and disconnected oil more oil is of course disconnected as we keep imbibing water into the sample the full data set identifies data point by its number along the main imbibition path mi01 mi02 and so on however for simplicity only select data points are discussed here from mi06 to mi07 a new blob is established with a curvature that is significantly different from the previous blob corresponding to a lower capillary pressure than the previous blob but still higher than the connected phase bulk pressure at mi08 additional interface falls generally into two groups one with curvature closer to zero corresponding to lower pressure and a second group with smaller curvature corresponding to higher capillary pressures and similar to the initial blob seen in mi06 fig 10 middle row the bottom row of images identifies the location of these various curvature values by color coding of the interfaces blue interfaces are associated with the peak at more negative curvatures higher pressures green interfaces have curvatures closer to zero although the average curvature keeps marching to the right as we progress to mi09 we see that new interface is generated as indicated by the arrows in the 3d surface plots that has a lower curvature i e a feature is added with a peak to the left of the preceding features see red arrow in curvature histogram as more interface is added the average interfacial pressure of the disconnected blobs approaches the bulk tensiometer pressure this suggests that while the pressure state of these newly developed blobs is influenced by the bulk fluid pressure it deviates from the bulk pressure when the local pore morphology forces a different arrangement of contact lines larger volume disconnected blobs would be expected to have mean curvatures closer to the bulk pressure because there is greater capacity for adjusting the fluid volume to match the bulk pressure note that the smaller blobs in fig 10 bottom row all have curvatures that strongly deviate from the bulk pressure noted by blue color while the larger blob is mostly green in color indicating curvatures comparable to the bulk pressure with small portions of the blob interface in blue this domination of the curvature by the pore geometry forces a pressure gradient within the disconnected blob fig 11 shows how capillary pressure and menisci curvature evolves for the interface between disconnected oil and connected water phase for a select number of points on the drainage curve the full drainage cycle for disconnected phase is presented in si 4 we immediately observe that for drainage the average pressure of disconnected phase is consistently lower than the connected bulk phase and transducer based pressure keeping in mind the results for imbibition it appears that the disconnected blobs exhibit a muted reflection of the wetting phase hysteresis the pressure state of the disconnected phase is bounded by the pressures of the connected fluid phase fig 12 this intuitively makes sense if we consider the earlier suggestion that pressures of disconnected blobs are dominated by pore morphology and influenced but not entirely governed by the pressure of the connected fluid these results are in good agreement with the recent work of singh et al 2017 who analyzed in detail three representative snap off events for a 3 8 mm diameter and 10 mm long ketton limestone rock sample the authors found that trapped phase re arranges itself in the pore space to minimize the oil pressure or energy which agrees well with our findings presented above despite that our data concerns trapped phase across the entire sample it should be noted here that the pressure differences between connected and disconnected phases are significant pressure differences in the middle of the hysteresis loop are on the order of 20 30 pa or about 10 of the magnitude of the connected phase pressures which is significantly beyond the error 0 02 expected for image based curvatures see fig 7 the pressure within different disconnected phases can vary significantly this can be seen by the sudden change in the curvature histogram between md02 and md05 in fig 11 during drainage as higher capillary pressures are imposed on the wetting phase oil invades and reconnects some of the previously disconnected blobs this reconnection of oil ganglia was also observed by andrew et al 2015 in this sequence of images the rather large multi pore ganglion of disconnected nonwetting phase that exists through md02 see red arrow in surface plot is not sustained at higher wetting phase capillary pressures as we progress to md05 intermediate points between md02 and md05 did not capture any changes in the fluid configurations and are therefore omitted as a result of this substantial change in fluid configuration the curvature histogram for md05 displays a corresponding rather large shift to the left i e to higher average curvature and thus lower disconnected phase pc values by removing the large ganglion the interfacial pc is now dominated by the remaining disconnected blobs their contribution could always be seen in the histogram as a smaller peak to the left of the main peak but it is the removal of the large ganglion that clarifies the identification of the contribution by these smaller disconnected blobs 4 discussion x ray tomography based imaging is the only tool presently available for non invasively exploring multiphase dynamics within porous media at the resolution needed to study interfaces and disconnected blobs in the past when quantifying the pressure saturation relationship the study was limited to the pressure distribution of connected phases that could be verified by tensiometers the new algorithm for estimating curvatures that is presented herein has permitted for the first time sufficient confidence to investigate the capillary pressure dynamics of disconnected phases during drainage and imbibition in doing so it became evident that the pore architecture plays a strong role in the capillary pressure of disconnected phases the discrepancy between bulk connected phase pressure and capillary pressure of trapped blobs is especially notable for the smaller blobs it is suggested here that for a trapped blob to equilibrate to the bulk pressure requires a sufficient minimum volume and overcoming contact angle hysteresis the concept of a sufficient minimum volume is interesting small blob volume will constrain the options for location of its interfaces the resulting capillary pressure will be determined by an energetic competition between the pore radii the contact angle and contact line adherence fig 13 contact line adherence and its associated contact angle hysteresis can impose pressure gradients across a blob as seen by the variation in color for different interfaces of the same blob in figs 10 and 11 and illustrated in greater detail in fig 14 for two select interfaces one for imbibition and one for drainage insight on the surface properties of the porous medium could be gained by investigating the width of the distribution of curvatures the second moment associated with disconnected blobs it is expected that the impact of pore geometry would be less for larger disconnected blobs where the volume can explore more pore space this might be the case for the glass bead data presented by garing et al 2017 their data analysis included only a single saturation point where the disconnected phase consisted of a fairly large ganglion we hypothesize that disconnected phase for lower saturations where the ganglia become smaller is more affected by the surrounding pore geometry and therefore each ganglia may consist of a wider distribution of curvatures as we see in this study also we expect that the resulting non wetting configuration from water flowing down a rock and trapping air would be very different than that resulting from water and oil that is pumped under pressure back and forth as we do in our experiments in the case of garing et al capillary pressures are quite close to the air entry pressures and completely controlled by pore size in their brine gravity filling there is little potential for development of contact angle hysteresis as brine moves into the system the wetting interface will move into the air filled pores until the pressure of the air phase is sufficient to stop the interface advance by contrast in our system as isolated blobs try to equilibrate to changes in pressure hysteresis effects may come into play as curvature and contact lines try to adjust for larger blobs that expand into many pores the pressure gradients across the blob and the second moment of the distribution of curvatures could be used to investigate the degree of hysteresis that is associated with solid surface properties providing valuable analytical tools as this technique is applied to real porous media 5 conclusions this work presents novel measurements of the internal pressure of a disconnected oil blob this was facilitated by a new method we developed for estimating from cmt images the curvature of liquid liquid interfaces within porous media the new method raises the accuracy overall from 91 4 to 94 5 and for pores with radii in excess of 50 voxels the accuracy is increased to 99 8 since to date quantifying pressure saturation relationships for multiphase fluids in porous media was limited to measuring the connected fluid phase with tensiometers this new tool significantly expands the potential for understanding the physics of multiphase flow the improvement was achieved by reducing the contribution associated with the interfacial zone near the contact line where liquid solid phase interactions and image innacuracies add artifacts to the data the new curvature estimation method included the elimination of data within a distance threshold of the solid surface surface modification and a distance weighting approach it should be noted that this study was conducted on cmt data that is 10 years old with a voxel resolution of 13 µm with the improvements in the cmt technique we now regularly collect cmt data at 2 4 µm resolution and would expect even better performance of the curvature estimation algorithm however there are of course also limitations to the approach and we expect that as the porous medium becomes increasingly complex and pore sizes approach the limit of image resolution it becomes more difficult to estimate the curvatures with this level of accuracy it is worth mentioning that singh et al 2017 define the euclidean dilation distance in three dimensions normal to the solid surface whereas we define our non euclidean contact line distance on a curved surface the triangle can be more than 10 units away from the contact line but still be within the much shorter dilation distance from the solid surface especially on water wet surface with acute contact angles thus we hypothesize that the approach presented here could potentially be more flexible or robust especially at relatively coarse resolution where a three dimensional dilation by 2 3 voxels would eliminate a large part of the good triangles in favor of this hypothesis herring et al 2017 presented very convincing data for multi phase flow in a bentheimer sandstone using an algorithm similar to ours using this method we explored the pressure state of disconnected nonwetting phase during drainage and imbibition we made a number of unprecedented observations that sheds light on the fundamentals of multi phase flow in porous media first during wetting phase drainage multi pore ganglia of disconnected nonwetting phase are not sustained as saturation decreases they reconnect to the main non wetting phase during wetting phase imbibition the pressure state of individual blobs appears to be more strongly controlled by pore morphology than by bulk fluid pressure blobs are established at pressures above the bulk fluid pressure out of sequence the pressure saturation curve for the disconnected non wetting phase forms a hysteretic envelope that exists well inside of the main hysteresis loop of the connected wetting phase this new and significantly more accurate method for estimating interfacial curvature in cmt images provides a novel tool to advance investigations of multiphase flow in porous media by permitting the accurate analysis of connected

porter and wildenschild 2010 schlüter et al 2014 an important characteristic of flow in unsaturated porous media is the capillary pressure saturation relationship the connection between capillary pressure and fluid fluid interfacial curvature expressed by the young laplace y l equation opens new avenues of exploration in pore scale imaging and image analysis in the young laplace equation 1 p c σ 1 r 1 1 r 2 2 k m e a n σ pc is capillary pressure r 1 and r 2 are the two orthogonal principal radii of curvature kmean is mean interfacial curvature and σ is interfacial tension two fundamentally different approaches exist for estimating the interface curvature from image data 1 a voxel based approach that uses the image intensity gradient however curvature estimation using this method is associated with various limitations and is highly sensitive to image quality bullard et al 1995 thirion and gourdon 1995 2 a surface based approach introduced by armstrong et al 2012a that uses a triangulated surface generated from the segmented images to estimate curvature the most commonly adopted approach for surface generation is the marching cubes algorithm lorensen and cline 1987 although the surface based approach is becoming more frequently used armstrong et al 2012b armstrong and wildenschild 2012 andrew et al 2014 armstrong et al 2014 singh et al 2016 and garing et al 2017 curvature estimates remain sensitive to various issues such as the amount of smoothing segmentation accuracy and image pixelation e g armstrong et al 2012a and garing et al 2017 recent attempts to improve the accuracy of curvature estimation have mainly focused on image quality garing et al 2017 for instance reported that variation in curvatures seen at 2x resolution 3 28 µm voxels was absent at 4x resolution 1 62 µm voxels for their glass bead samples yet for their sandstone rock samples there was variation in curvatures for disconnected phase at both the 2x and 4x resolutions two very recent studies by herring et al 2017 and singh et al 2017 employ techniques similar to what is presented here herring et al based their approach directly on the work presented here while singh et al applied dilation by a fixed number of voxels of their rock surfaces to achieve a similar approach to what we achieve with a percentage clipping of the interface near the solid surface instead of focusing on increased image resolution this paper introduces a more accurate method for curvature estimation the improved algorithm is validated against synthetic data and real cmt data sets using measured capillary pressure values from a multi phase flow drainage imbibition experiment finally the new method is used to gain insights into the evolution of the capillary pressure of a disconnected nonwetting phase trapped within a porous medium 2 materials and methods this section describes the different image processing approaches used for curvature estimation and the experimental and synthetic data sets used for verification and testing of the new method 2 1 experimental data sets the first numerical data set discussed is a series of computer generated images of interface menisci within capillary tubes of different radii these analytical configurations were used to validate the new curvature algorithm and quantify curvature estimation error a hemisphere was generated within a column in order to create a perfect concave meniscus then a grey scale image was generated and the image analyzed using the same method as for cmt obtained images for these computer generated data sets the theoretical mean curvature values for each data set is known calculated as the reciprocal of the radius the second real cmt data set was collected at the advanced photon source argonne national laboratory the experimental system consisted of water wet glass beads with a ratio of 35 0 6 mm diameter 35 0 8 mm diameter and 30 1 0 1 4 mm diameter packed into a 25 0 mm long glass column with an inside radius of 3 5 mm porter et al 2010 armstrong et al 2012a the two phases used were soltrol 220 non wetting phase ρ 0 79 g cm3 σ 0 0378 n m and potassium iodide doped water wetting phase 1 6 mass ratio of ki h2o density 1 17 g ml the non wetting phase was connected to the top of the column and the wetting phase was connected to the bottom of the column a semi permeable hydrophilic membrane was placed at the bottom of the column to prevent the non wetting phase from entering the water path pressure transducers connected to the oil and water lines and referenced to the top of the sample were used to externally record capillary pressures as the difference between wetting and nonwetting phase pressures wetting phase volume was controlled to 1 µl by a syringe pump gilson 402 the system was first fully saturated with wetting phase followed by primary drainage pd which nearly saturated the bead pack with oil then main imbibition mi main drainage md secondary imbibition si and secondary drainage sd all referring to the wetting phase for each drainage or imbibition a varying but precise µl amount of wetting phase was pumped out of drainage or into imbibition the system at a flow rate of 0 6 ml h in a number of incremental steps about 15 min were required for the fluids to reach quasi equilibrium after each saturation change we define quasi equilibrium as a state where significant progress towards equilibrium has been made on a time scale of minutes but where complete equilibrium is not expected to be achieved for many hours gray et al 2015 and schlüter et al 2017 quasi equilibrium was verified by checking the images if fluids were still moving during the scan the resulting images would be blurry if that was the case the sample would be rescanned after another 15 min wait period x ray cmt images were obtained from a 5 5 mm section of the column at 13 µm voxel resolution all of the two dimensional radiographs were preprocessed and reconstructed using algorithms developed by geosoilenviro consortium for advanced radiation sources gsecars rivers et al 1999 to produce 3d volumes of data additional details about the experimental setup can be found in porter et al 2010 2 2 image processing all image processing was accomplished using the commercial software program avizo fire segmentation is a necessary and crucial step that allows for subsequent accurate data analysis and obviously relies heavily on the fidelity of the greyscale images generally greyscale images are noisy and depending on how significant the noise is it can negatively affect the quality of image segmentation hence image filtering is commonly employed as a first step in image analysis all the greyscale images in this work were subject to non local means filtering to remove noise and blur and then segmented using a watershed algorithm to render each phase to consist of a single label field 2 2 1 non local means filter because of the particle nature of synchrotron light shot noise random variations in brightness is prevalent in photon counting optical devices and x ray based images are therefore inherently noisy due to its efficiency at noise removal buades et al 2005 we applied a non local means filter to the greyscale images based on trial the search window local neighborhood and similarity value which define the window size the importance of each voxel in the window and weighting factor respectively were set to 4 7 and 3 voxels as shown in fig 1 it was challenging to identify peaks and valleys in the original greyscale histogram however after applying the non local means filter most of the noise is removed leading to a sharper histogram with distinct peaks representing oil water and beads and an image that is much more homogeneous and significantly easier to segment 2 2 2 segmentation image segmentation is the process of classifying or dividing an image into different regions of voxels with similar greyscale intensity thus the main goal of segmentation is to identify and convert a greyscale image into a simpler labeled image that is ready for subsequent analyses for segmentation of the data presented here we adopted the watershed segmentation as described by vincent et al 1991 a recent study by schlüter et al 2014 compared various segmentation methods and concluded that the watershed algorithm was among the best for segmenting datasets of two phase flow in porous media a scan of the dry bead pack was used to identify the solid phase which could then be superimposed on all other greyscale images relative to the analysis of armstrong et al 2012a in the present analysis we also fixed some minor and very local segmentation artifacts using the watershed approach the known regions in the data were initially identified by using a simple threshold next the unknown transition regions consisting of the points at the inflection between the two known phases are allocated to one of the phases by analyzing the image intensity gradient eventually the transitional regions will be minimized by the watershed module and labeled such that the 64 000 greyscale values are sorted into only 3 classes oil water and beads connected and disconnected wetting and non wetting phases were distinguished using markers this algorithm retrieves voxels in the image that are connected to a marker by using a 26 neighborhood connectivity requirement a marker for connected non wetting phase was placed on the top of the image the oil reservoir was physically connected to the top of the sample and a marker for connected wetting phase was placed at the bottom of the image connected to the water reservoir therefore the two fluid phases could be parsed into four configurations connected wetting connected non wetting disconnected wetting and disconnected non wetting the interface between the connected wetting phase and the connected non wetting phase exerts a capillary pressure that can be measured by an externally placed pressure transducer the connected phases therefore provide a basis for comparison between image based estimates of capillary pressure and externally measured capillary pressures in contrast pressure of disconnected phases can not be measured externally therefore accurately quantifying the interface geometry of disconnected fluid phases from tomographic images also provides us unprecedented insight into disconnected phase dynamics 2 3 surface generation three dimensional surface generation was accomplished with the marching cubes algorithm lorensen and cline 1987 which approximates a smoothed interface between different phases using thousands of triangles the number of triangles depends on the resolution of the input images i e higher resolution results in more triangles once the image is segmented and labeled the surface generation module in avizo can be applied with different smoothing settings type and extent the surface generation module provides two smoothing options constrained and unconstrained smoothing constrained smoothing guarantees that no label is altered during surface generation any two voxel centers that have been labeled differently before the smoothing are separated by the generated surface afterwards this is not necessarily the case for every small detail in the unconstrained case and is therefore not considered in this work smoothing extent was studied in detail due to its parabolic characteristics and because selection of an appropriate value involves some trade off higher smoothing extent does not necessarily result in an improved i e more accurate interface through careful evaluation of test spheres and capillary tubes we found that constrained smoothing using a gaussian filter with a smoothing extent of 3 voxels preserves the characteristics of the original data and provides adequate smoothing of the interface which allows for greatest accuracy in the subsequent data analysis in the interest of conciseness the details of this separate investigation is not included here we refer to li 2015 for further details about the smoothing process 2 4 curvature calculation for a two dimensional system curvature is the inverse of the radius of an infinitely closely inscribed circle at a given point in a three dimensional shape the normal vector and tangent vector are used to define the plane on which the curvature is calculated fig 2 all curves with the same tangent vector occupy the same normal vector taking into account all possible curvatures at a point on a surface the maximum and minimum curvature values are called the principal curvatures k 1 and k2 respectively the mean curvature is then used to calculate capillary pressures by the young laplace equation eq 1 the mean curvature is defined as half the sum of the principal curvatures kmean k1 k2 2 while the gaussian curvature which is the product of the principal curvatures k1 k2 can also been used to extract details of interfacial geometry it is not relevant for estimation of capillary pressures capillary pressures estimated from surface based curvature calculations suffer from errors introduced by limited image resolution along the triple line and physicochemical interactions near solid surfaces no matter the image data size and resolution the edge of the interface where oil and water connects near the solid surface will be rough and this generates inaccurate curvature estimates in this region fig 3 armstrong et al 2012a dealt with this problem by eliminating all positive curvatures values when calculating mean curvature method 2 in table 1 in this study we propose a different methodology to increase the accuracy of the mean curvature estimate the triangles that are close to the solid surface should either be given lower weight when generating the mean estimate or be entirely eliminated from consideration based on their proximity to the solid surface by doing so mean curvature is estimated based primarily on segments of the interface that are not affected by their proximity to the solid surface each triangle is defined by three vertices as shown in fig 4 a to accomplish this we measure the shortest distance between each triangle s vertex and the solid surface fig 4b the vertex distance calculation was performed based on dijkstra s shortest edge distance algorithm dijkstra 1959 the shortest edge distance of a triangle is calculated as the average of its three shortest vertex distances following the argument above we introduce two new approaches that eliminate the effect of the solid surface on the curvature estimates 2 4 1 distance weighting the shortest edge distance for each triangle is used as a weight factor to improve curvature calculations by assigning more weight to triangles far from the solid surface and less to those that may be affected by the solid surface see method 3 in table 1 this so called distance weighted mean curvature value for the interface km dw is estimated based on the following equation 2 k m d w i n k i d i i n d i where the curvature value for each triangle ki is multiplied by the triangle s respective shortest edge distance di 2 4 2 surface modification curvature estimates can also be improved by modifying the surface a triangle is eliminated the surface is clipped if it is considered too close to the edge solid surface by determining if the shortest edge distance value is less than a chosen threshold dmin as an example assume a threshold of 9 5 voxels and two triangles with vertex distance values as shown in fig 5 in this case the triangle on the left meets the requirement and will be preserved whereas the one on the right is eliminated from further consideration mean curvature and distance values for the preserved triangles are then used for generating surface modified mean curvature histograms method 4 in table 1 3 k m s m k 1 k 2 2 f o r d i d m i n combining the distance weighted and surface modification methods method 5 in table 1 yields eq 4 4 k m d w s m i n k i d i i n d i f o r d i d m i n the surface modification approach was validated using as a model a numerically generated interface associated with a synthetic capillary tube with an internal radius of 50 voxels the theoretical mean curvature value of this meniscus is 0 02 voxel 1 indicated by the red vertical line in fig 6 a after testing of a range of threshold values the shortest edge distance threshold dmin was set to 20 in this case 20 of the 50 voxel radius an example of the surface modification achieved using this approach is illustrated in fig 6b and ultimately the successful match with the externally measured transducer pressures confirms this choice the resulting histograms for unmodified and modified interfaces fig 6a illustrates that the curvature value after surface modification clusters more narrowly around the theoretical value but more importantly the more positive values that are influenced by the solid surface have been successfully eliminated for the real cmt data discussed later the threshold was set to 20 percent of the maximum distance value for each data set conceptually equivalent to 20 of a pore radii in a very recent paper singh et al 2017 used a similar approach by dilating the rock surfaces near the solid surface to eliminate interface voxels affected by the solid surface however they set their cufoff threshold to a fixed value of 4 voxels as they found that any further dilation affected the curvature values in a negative way this is likely because they are working with rock samples with much finer features than the glass bead data used in this study which contains larger pores and interfaces relative to the voxel resolution and therefore leaves sufficient curvature behind after a percentage clipping to facilitate reliable curvature estimation herring et al 2017 used an approach that follows our algorithm in terms of eliminating curvature measurements near the solid surface and assigning higher weights to curvature measurements farther away from the solid surface to achieve the desired accuracy for their more complex geometry bentheimer sandstone with pore sizes approaching the image resolution they included sub voxel precise registration of the euclidian distance map of the dry image to their partially saturated volumes both the segmented and grey scale images 3 results 3 1 testing the new curvature estimation method the synthetic data set menisci in capillary tubes of different radii was used to test the accuracy of the five different methods described earlier and listed in table 1 because curvature estimation becomes tenuous for very small features we expect to see significant improvement in the curvature estimates for larger radii tubes the percentage errors listed in fig 7 are calculated as 5 p e r c e n t a g e e r r o r m e a s u r e d v a l u e t h e o r e t i c a l v a l u e t h e o r e t i c a l v a l u e it should be noted here that for a synthetic image units do not really make sense and the units can be referred to as voxels or microns interchangeably the results in fig 7 show that for the smallest capillary tube r 10 voxels all methods introduce 9 or more error however as soon as the tube radius increases we see a decrease in the error with increasing sophistication of the estimation method for methods 1 and 2 i e using the entire data set or negative values only respectively the error remains at 6 or more regardless of the size of the capillary tube implementing the distance weighted algorithm method 3 reduces the maximum error to below 5 for a radius of 25 μm and approaches 1 5 for the largest tube the surface modification method 4 generates curvature estimates that are below 5 error at a capillary tube radius of 20 μm and improves considerably to only 3 error for the maximum radius tested and finally by combining distance weighting with surface modification method 5 the decrease in error with increasing tube size is further enhanced ending up at only 0 02 for the 55 mm tube clearly combining these two new curvature estimation methods results in vast improvement over existing methods while the error calculated for a specific pore size decreases with increasing radii natural porous media will present to the fluid a distribution of pore sizes therefore a characteristic accuracy for each method when applied to a media consisting of variously sized pores is here calculated by the slope of the linear correlation between theoretical and measured curvatures across all pore sizes tested fig 8 note that a slope less than 1 signifies that all methods tend towards underestimating the curvature as the methods march from 1 through 5 the slope approaches unity thereby indicating improvement in accuracy with increasing sophistication of the estimation method having successfully completed this method validation we used the improved curvature estimation approach method 5 table 1 to analyze curvatures for the real cmt data set described earlier porter et al 2010 converting curvature estimates to capillary pressure pc via the young laplace equation then comparing this image based pc to pc measured using external pressure transducers in a previous study armstrong et al 2012a analyzed the data set from porter et al 2010 and demonstrated that by considering only connected fluid interfaces and eliminating positive curvature values from consideration transducer based capillary pressure and curvature based capillary pressure agreed surprisingly well for imbibition however the image based measurement underestimated pc relative to the transducer measurements for drainage armstrong et al proposed two different reasons for this discrepancy 1 short equilibration time and 2 inaccurate curvature measurement in the following we recalculate the curvatures for the same dataset using our new method method 5 in table 1 convert these to pc values eq 1 σ 0 0378 n m as in porter et al 2010 and compare the outcome with the results of armstrong et al 2012a the improved curvature based capillary pressure estimates show very favorable agreement with the transducer based capillary pressures much improved over the data of armstrong et al 2012a b fig 9 the new data set was also used to investigate the evolution of menisci curvatures for the connected water phase as saturation changed during imbibition as more water enters the sample through the bottom port and oil is pushed out of the system through the top port menisci curvatures shift towards more positive values corresponding to lower pc whereas for drainage the exact opposite behavior is observed see supporting information si 1 and si 2 thus there are no surprises in terms of interpretation of the connected phase behavior 3 2 capillary pressures of disconnected phases the accuracy gained in predicting fluid capillary pressures from curvatures facilitates the computation of liquid pressure of disconnected fluid components disconnected oil blobs this has not been achieved before as there has been no mechanism available for measuring the pressure state of disconnected blobs inside a three dimensional porous medium during main imbibition mi as water imbibes into the oil filled media blobs of oil remain that become disconnected from the bulk oil phase fig 10 shows how capillary pressure and curvature evolves for the interface between disconnected oil blobs and connected water phase for a select number of points on the imbibition curve the full imbibition cycle for disconnected phase is presented in si 3 a number of interesting features are evident in the data during imbibition the average pressure of the disconnected phase calculated via interfacial curvatures is consistently higher than the bulk connected phase measured by transducer moving from left to right in fig 10 as water saturation increases more interface is established between connected water and disconnected oil more oil is of course disconnected as we keep imbibing water into the sample the full data set identifies data point by its number along the main imbibition path mi01 mi02 and so on however for simplicity only select data points are discussed here from mi06 to mi07 a new blob is established with a curvature that is significantly different from the previous blob corresponding to a lower capillary pressure than the previous blob but still higher than the connected phase bulk pressure at mi08 additional interface falls generally into two groups one with curvature closer to zero corresponding to lower pressure and a second group with smaller curvature corresponding to higher capillary pressures and similar to the initial blob seen in mi06 fig 10 middle row the bottom row of images identifies the location of these various curvature values by color coding of the interfaces blue interfaces are associated with the peak at more negative curvatures higher pressures green interfaces have curvatures closer to zero although the average curvature keeps marching to the right as we progress to mi09 we see that new interface is generated as indicated by the arrows in the 3d surface plots that has a lower curvature i e a feature is added with a peak to the left of the preceding features see red arrow in curvature histogram as more interface is added the average interfacial pressure of the disconnected blobs approaches the bulk tensiometer pressure this suggests that while the pressure state of these newly developed blobs is influenced by the bulk fluid pressure it deviates from the bulk pressure when the local pore morphology forces a different arrangement of contact lines larger volume disconnected blobs would be expected to have mean curvatures closer to the bulk pressure because there is greater capacity for adjusting the fluid volume to match the bulk pressure note that the smaller blobs in fig 10 bottom row all have curvatures that strongly deviate from the bulk pressure noted by blue color while the larger blob is mostly green in color indicating curvatures comparable to the bulk pressure with small portions of the blob interface in blue this domination of the curvature by the pore geometry forces a pressure gradient within the disconnected blob fig 11 shows how capillary pressure and menisci curvature evolves for the interface between disconnected oil and connected water phase for a select number of points on the drainage curve the full drainage cycle for disconnected phase is presented in si 4 we immediately observe that for drainage the average pressure of disconnected phase is consistently lower than the connected bulk phase and transducer based pressure keeping in mind the results for imbibition it appears that the disconnected blobs exhibit a muted reflection of the wetting phase hysteresis the pressure state of the disconnected phase is bounded by the pressures of the connected fluid phase fig 12 this intuitively makes sense if we consider the earlier suggestion that pressures of disconnected blobs are dominated by pore morphology and influenced but not entirely governed by the pressure of the connected fluid these results are in good agreement with the recent work of singh et al 2017 who analyzed in detail three representative snap off events for a 3 8 mm diameter and 10 mm long ketton limestone rock sample the authors found that trapped phase re arranges itself in the pore space to minimize the oil pressure or energy which agrees well with our findings presented above despite that our data concerns trapped phase across the entire sample it should be noted here that the pressure differences between connected and disconnected phases are significant pressure differences in the middle of the hysteresis loop are on the order of 20 30 pa or about 10 of the magnitude of the connected phase pressures which is significantly beyond the error 0 02 expected for image based curvatures see fig 7 the pressure within different disconnected phases can vary significantly this can be seen by the sudden change in the curvature histogram between md02 and md05 in fig 11 during drainage as higher capillary pressures are imposed on the wetting phase oil invades and reconnects some of the previously disconnected blobs this reconnection of oil ganglia was also observed by andrew et al 2015 in this sequence of images the rather large multi pore ganglion of disconnected nonwetting phase that exists through md02 see red arrow in surface plot is not sustained at higher wetting phase capillary pressures as we progress to md05 intermediate points between md02 and md05 did not capture any changes in the fluid configurations and are therefore omitted as a result of this substantial change in fluid configuration the curvature histogram for md05 displays a corresponding rather large shift to the left i e to higher average curvature and thus lower disconnected phase pc values by removing the large ganglion the interfacial pc is now dominated by the remaining disconnected blobs their contribution could always be seen in the histogram as a smaller peak to the left of the main peak but it is the removal of the large ganglion that clarifies the identification of the contribution by these smaller disconnected blobs 4 discussion x ray tomography based imaging is the only tool presently available for non invasively exploring multiphase dynamics within porous media at the resolution needed to study interfaces and disconnected blobs in the past when quantifying the pressure saturation relationship the study was limited to the pressure distribution of connected phases that could be verified by tensiometers the new algorithm for estimating curvatures that is presented herein has permitted for the first time sufficient confidence to investigate the capillary pressure dynamics of disconnected phases during drainage and imbibition in doing so it became evident that the pore architecture plays a strong role in the capillary pressure of disconnected phases the discrepancy between bulk connected phase pressure and capillary pressure of trapped blobs is especially notable for the smaller blobs it is suggested here that for a trapped blob to equilibrate to the bulk pressure requires a sufficient minimum volume and overcoming contact angle hysteresis the concept of a sufficient minimum volume is interesting small blob volume will constrain the options for location of its interfaces the resulting capillary pressure will be determined by an energetic competition between the pore radii the contact angle and contact line adherence fig 13 contact line adherence and its associated contact angle hysteresis can impose pressure gradients across a blob as seen by the variation in color for different interfaces of the same blob in figs 10 and 11 and illustrated in greater detail in fig 14 for two select interfaces one for imbibition and one for drainage insight on the surface properties of the porous medium could be gained by investigating the width of the distribution of curvatures the second moment associated with disconnected blobs it is expected that the impact of pore geometry would be less for larger disconnected blobs where the volume can explore more pore space this might be the case for the glass bead data presented by garing et al 2017 their data analysis included only a single saturation point where the disconnected phase consisted of a fairly large ganglion we hypothesize that disconnected phase for lower saturations where the ganglia become smaller is more affected by the surrounding pore geometry and therefore each ganglia may consist of a wider distribution of curvatures as we see in this study also we expect that the resulting non wetting configuration from water flowing down a rock and trapping air would be very different than that resulting from water and oil that is pumped under pressure back and forth as we do in our experiments in the case of garing et al capillary pressures are quite close to the air entry pressures and completely controlled by pore size in their brine gravity filling there is little potential for development of contact angle hysteresis as brine moves into the system the wetting interface will move into the air filled pores until the pressure of the air phase is sufficient to stop the interface advance by contrast in our system as isolated blobs try to equilibrate to changes in pressure hysteresis effects may come into play as curvature and contact lines try to adjust for larger blobs that expand into many pores the pressure gradients across the blob and the second moment of the distribution of curvatures could be used to investigate the degree of hysteresis that is associated with solid surface properties providing valuable analytical tools as this technique is applied to real porous media 5 conclusions this work presents novel measurements of the internal pressure of a disconnected oil blob this was facilitated by a new method we developed for estimating from cmt images the curvature of liquid liquid interfaces within porous media the new method raises the accuracy overall from 91 4 to 94 5 and for pores with radii in excess of 50 voxels the accuracy is increased to 99 8 since to date quantifying pressure saturation relationships for multiphase fluids in porous media was limited to measuring the connected fluid phase with tensiometers this new tool significantly expands the potential for understanding the physics of multiphase flow the improvement was achieved by reducing the contribution associated with the interfacial zone near the contact line where liquid solid phase interactions and image innacuracies add artifacts to the data the new curvature estimation method included the elimination of data within a distance threshold of the solid surface surface modification and a distance weighting approach it should be noted that this study was conducted on cmt data that is 10 years old with a voxel resolution of 13 µm with the improvements in the cmt technique we now regularly collect cmt data at 2 4 µm resolution and would expect even better performance of the curvature estimation algorithm however there are of course also limitations to the approach and we expect that as the porous medium becomes increasingly complex and pore sizes approach the limit of image resolution it becomes more difficult to estimate the curvatures with this level of accuracy it is worth mentioning that singh et al 2017 define the euclidean dilation distance in three dimensions normal to the solid surface whereas we define our non euclidean contact line distance on a curved surface the triangle can be more than 10 units away from the contact line but still be within the much shorter dilation distance from the solid surface especially on water wet surface with acute contact angles thus we hypothesize that the approach presented here could potentially be more flexible or robust especially at relatively coarse resolution where a three dimensional dilation by 2 3 voxels would eliminate a large part of the good triangles in favor of this hypothesis herring et al 2017 presented very convincing data for multi phase flow in a bentheimer sandstone using an algorithm similar to ours using this method we explored the pressure state of disconnected nonwetting phase during drainage and imbibition we made a number of unprecedented observations that sheds light on the fundamentals of multi phase flow in porous media first during wetting phase drainage multi pore ganglia of disconnected nonwetting phase are not sustained as saturation decreases they reconnect to the main non wetting phase during wetting phase imbibition the pressure state of individual blobs appears to be more strongly controlled by pore morphology than by bulk fluid pressure blobs are established at pressures above the bulk fluid pressure out of sequence the pressure saturation curve for the disconnected non wetting phase forms a hysteretic envelope that exists well inside of the main hysteresis loop of the connected wetting phase this new and significantly more accurate method for estimating interfacial curvature in cmt images provides a novel tool to advance investigations of multiphase flow in porous media by permitting the accurate analysis of connected and disconnected phases acknowledgments this research was supported by the u s national science foundation award 1344877 part of this research was performed at geosoilenvirocars the university of

851,long term persistence ltp of annual river runoff is a topic of ongoing hydrological research due to its implications to water resources management here we estimate its strength measured by the hurst coefficient h in 696 annual globally distributed streamflow records with at least 80 years of data we use three estimation methods maximum likelihood estimator whittle estimator and least squares variance resulting in similar mean values of h close to 0 65 subsequently we explore potential factors influencing h by two linear spearman s rank correlation multiple linear regression and two non linear self organizing maps random forests techniques catchment area is found to be crucial for medium to larger watersheds while climatic controls such as aridity index have higher impact to smaller ones our findings indicate that long term persistence is weaker than found in other studies suggesting that enhanced ltp is encountered in large catchment rivers were the effect of spatial aggregation is more intense however we also show that the estimated values of h can be reproduced by a short term persistence stochastic model such as an auto regressive ar 1 process a direct consequence is that some of the most common methods for the estimation of h coefficient might not be suitable for discriminating short and long term persistence even in long observational records keywords river runoff long term persistence long range dependence self organizing maps random forests catchment classification 1 introduction long term persistence ltp also known as long range dependence was introduced by harold edwin hurst 1951 as a statistical behaviour of the nile flow that could not be described by the established statistical theory of that time unknown to him kolmogorov 1940 had already developed its mathematical formulation which was acknowledged many years later to a robust mathematical framework by mandelbrot and wallis 1968 since then ltp has been not only an elementary component of stochastic hydrology montanari 2003 but also identified in many other geophysical biological and artificial times series o connell et al 2016 and references therein the most intriguing property of long term persistence is the multi scale deviations of the local mean which might lead to intense slopes and or clustering of the extremes the latter has been often expressed as the tendency of low values to follow low ones and high values to succeed high ones the former implies that slope significance would be overestimated in a time series exhibiting ltp smith 1993 cohn and lins 2005 and therefore appropriate statistical test should be used such the one suggested by hamed 2008 in addition it became apparent that to determine accurately its magnitude long records of data are needed because ltp might mask its true behaviour in shorter lengths koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 as a rule the stronger the ltp the longer the time series record needed during the last decades a few studies have further investigated this phenomenon in streamflow the largest one in terms of number of records analysed was performed by pelletier and turcotte 1997 who studied 636 deseasonalized monthly records in the united states with length greater than 40 years supporting the evidence of medium ltp in river runoff other researchers presented similar results e g kantelhardt et al 2006 studied 42 long daily runoff records from all over the world average 77 years wang et al 2007 investigated 31 stations with daily data and at least 30 years over europe and n america and bogachev and bunde 2012 analysed 20 long records above 100 years from europe the recent studies cover also european serinaldi et al 2014 szolgayova et al 2014 and n american rivers serinaldi and kilsby 2016 showing strong variability in the strength of ltp behaviour ranging from very weak to extremely intense which could be due to the large uncertainty in its determination even for long records beran 1994 this large variability of ltp was investigated by szolgayova et al 2014 in terms of catchment attributes such as catchment area mean annual temperature and precipitation elevation mean discharge specific mean discharge and seasonality amongst them catchment area was found to be the most significant one confirming previous studies mudelsee 2007 hirpa et al 2010 other factors that have been found to enhance ltp behaviour is the existence of lakes and or dams zhang et al 2012 while the degree of catchment urbanization potentially abates it jovanovic et al 2016 the above studies are based on a relatively small number of records and thus their results need to be further explored here we attempt to extend past and contemporary research at a global scale by using 696 annual river runoff records with at least 80 years from the global runoff data base grdb global runoff data centre 2016 the data records were checked for inconsistencies through visual inspection and algorithmic testing and a quality index was assigned to each one of them we use three well established methods for the estimation of ltp i e maximum likelihood estimator whittle estimator and least squares variance finally we explore possible links of ltp behaviour with various streamflow and catchment attributes by implementing linear spearman s rank correlation multiple linear regression and non linear self organizing maps random forests techniques to continuous and categorical variables 2 data methods 2 1 dataset quality control from the original grdb comprising 9252 stations 4070 rivers we initially selected 815 time series from 605 rivers with mean streamflow above 1 m3 s sample sizes above 80 years and missing value intervals below 10 years the metadata of the records were not available and common homogenization techniques are inadequate for hydrological data kundzewicz and robson 2000 especially when there are long term fluctuations which might be falsely identified as artificial breakpoints of the mean rybski and neumann 2011 therefore a visual inspection procedure was followed to verify data quality on a one by one basis to three quality classes a b and c and a final data set of 696 records markonis et al 2018 other gridded datasets used were cru ts3 22 1900 2012 for precipitation harris and jones 2014 princeton global pdsi 1948 2008 for potential evaporation sheffield et al 2012 and the köppen geiger global classification of kottek et al 2006 for the years 1951 2000 the means of precipitation and potential evaporation were estimated for the whole period in 2 5 2 5 spatial resolution the same resolution was applied to the köppen geiger classes in terms of the most encountered class per grid cell here we assume that this resolution can be regarded representative for the majority of the catchments keeping in mind though that they could be biased for the largest smallest watersheds finally we have estimated the potential evaporation to precipitation ratio as a representative measure of the catchment s dryness aridity index in table 1 the basic attributes of the final dataset consisting of 696 stations are presented an interactive map of the the dataset information along with the corresponding classifications quality flags and analysis results can be found at https shiny fzp czu cz kvhem riversltp 2 2 estimation of ltp long term persistence is determined by the hurst coefficient h 0 1 which links the standard deviation σ at unit time scale with that at the temporal scale k by 1 σ k k h 1 σ where σ k is the standard deviation of the process at scale k a stochastic process with h greater than smaller than or equal to 0 5 is characterized respectively as persistence anti persistence or white noise hurst coefficient can be estimated based on several methods as the results of numerous comparisons on their efficiency suggest taqqu et al 1995 stroe kunold et al 2009 rea et al 2009 tyralis and koutsoyiannis 2011 witt and malamud 2013 dimitriadis and koutsoyiannis 2015 here we apply the maximum likelihood estimation mle hipel and mcleod 1994 the whittle estimator beran 1994 and the least square variance method lsv tyralis and koutsoyiannis 2011 which have been found to be more robust and present similar biases in relatively small sample sizes the detrended fluctuation analysis dfa technique which has been used in some previous studies matsoukas et al 2000 kantelhardt et al 2006 hirpa et al 2010 bogachev and bunde 2012 has not been chosen due to recent findings of biases in its results bryce and sprague 2012 höll and kantz 2015 lovsletten 2016 although all the chosen methods are ranked high in most benchmark studies we should keep in mind that all of them assume that the underlying process exhibits ltp and have poor results when estimating h for simple autoregressive processes papalexiou et al 2010 serinaldi and kilsby 2016 for example an ar 1 process this means h 0 5 with lag 1 autocorrelation ρ 0 4 and sample size equal to 1000 values gives h lsv h whi h mle 0 77 0 76 0 72 estimated by monte carlo simulation 1000 iterations of synthetic ltp time series thus the ltp estimators are prone to type ii error i e not rejecting a false null hypothesis existence of ltp and the alternative hypothesis that the estimated h arise from short term persistence should also be examined to this end 1000 synthetic time series from a markovian model ar 1 were produced with mean standard deviation autocorrelation coefficient and sample size equal to the empirical record and we determined h using the same three methods its statistical significance was measured by the non parametric mann whitney wilcoxon test to determine if the underlying process is in fact a short term persistence process finally the effect of record size has been also depicted combined with sensitivity analysis to determine the 0 9 confidence interval of estimates h at each station again the monte carlo approach has been chosen to create 1000 random replicates of each time series by the fractional gaussian noise fgn and ar 1 process and the h estimates were compared between actual record length 500 and 1000 years the h estimates have been also validated versus the periodogram approach which has been shown to be more efficient in smaller sample sizes taqqu et al 1995 caballero et al 2002 as the finite size effect is quite stronger in variance methods lennartz and bunde 2009 2 3 linear and non linear correlations the initial streamflow catchment parameters chosen to be examined were geographical location catchment area log transformed average annual streamflow log transformed elevation annual precipitation potential evaporation köppen geiger classification and record length we have used two linear and two non linear statistical methods for the exploration of the dependence between these attributes and hurst coefficient unless otherwise stated the mle estimates were used initially the spearman s rank correlation was used we have also used the resulting correlation matrix to discriminate the most evident dependencies and further investigate the associated variables via multiple linear regression and produce a linear model of the form 2 h a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a n x n ɛ where a i are the model coefficients xi the correlated variables and ε the error term for the selection of the optimal number of variables a mixed selection procedure was followed as described by gareth et al 2013 in addition to traditional statistical methods during the last decades many non linear iterative techniques have been developed for classification purposes self organizing maps soms is a dimension reduction technique similar to principal component analysis used for feature extraction and cluster analysis kohonen 1982 the som approach projects the data space onto a usually two dimensional grid preserving their topological structure hence enlightening visualizations of the data space can be created not only presenting the clusters with similar features but also their relative relationships although classification techniques have not been common in hydrology mcdonnell and woods 2004 during the last years soms have been successfully implemented in an increasing number of studies hall and minns 1999 hsu et al 2002 moradkhani et al 2004 lin and chen 2006 chang et al 2010 hsu and li 2010 ley et al 2011 tiwari et al 2013 toth 2013 a detailed description of the algorithm and its properties is described by kohonen 2001 while a review of the som approach in water resources has been presented by kalteh et al 2008 random forests have also recently shown some promising results in hydrological applications booker and snelder 2012 chen et al 2012 booker and woods 2014 naghibi et al 2016 li et al 2016 this technique is based on the regression tree algorithm which uses a tree structure to split the dataset into homogenous partitions by following some splitting rule e g minimizing the variance of a given set of variables then an ensemble of different regression trees is created by bootstrapping the original sample and permuting the set of variables breiman 2001 the significance of each variable can be quantified through the variable importance vimp and minimal depth md measures variable importance takes advantage of the out of bag data to estimate the difference in the predictive ability of the random forest if any one of the randomly picked variables is replaced by another in minimal depth the variables that partition larger samples of the population more frequently are assumed to describe the dataset more sufficiently these variables are found at the first node levels of the tree i e nearest to its trunk the minimal depth is estimated by averaging the relative distance of the first split of each variable from the trunk for the whole forest breiman 2001 yet the vimp measure can be biased when the input variables are correlated or do not share a common scale or number of categories kuhn and johnson 2013 and therefore to remedy this issue the cforest algorithm was also applied strobl et al 2008 all the analyses and the presentation of results have been performed using the statistical software r r core team 2016 the algorithms for the h coefficient estimation were applied through the packages fgn mcleod and veenstra 2015 hkprocess tyralis 2015 and fractal constantine and percival 2016 the som algorithm is applied through package the kohonen wehrens and buydens 2007 while for the random forests the randomforest liaw and wiener 2015 and party hothorn et al 2017 packages were used 3 results 3 1 long term persistence the hurst coefficient was found between 0 3 and 1 fig 1 and in agreement among each method in terms of mean h lsv h whi h mle 0 65 0 65 0 63 and standard deviation σ lsv σ whi σ mle 0 097 0 094 0 095 the estimates for records of the a quality see markonis et al 2018 fall to h lsv h whi h mle 0 63 0 63 0 61 with the other categories retaining higher values table 2 this is expected since potential anthropogenic influences or biases in time series homogeneity introduce shifts in mean and trends which could increase h salas et al 1979 bhattacharya et al 1983 zhang et al 2012 another factor that could affect the determination of h is the heterogeneity in the geographical distribution of the stations it is obvious table 1 that the majority of the stations are located at northern mid latitudes namely at europe and n america however there is no significant deviation in the estimation of h per continent or latitude category table 2 with a mean equal to 0 65 if averaged by continent excluding south america due to small sample size or 0 64 if averaged by latitude category these h values are lower compared to other studies e g szolgayova et al 2014 suggest that most of the european stations have h 0 8 kantelhardt et al 2006 estimate a mean h value close to 0 72 while other studies advocate for 0 75 0 8 pelletier and turcotte 1997 bogachev and bunde 2012 all previous works have used deseasonalized daily or monthly data resulting to sample sizes ranging between 103 and 105 significantly larger compared to this study and it is known that sample size is a crucial factor for the unbiased determination of ltp e g see koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 and that methods which estimate h through variance show strong finite size effects lennartz and bunde 2009 to determine if this could be a potential factor for underestimation of hurst coefficient a series of monte carlo simulations have been performed initially we compared the distributions of h estimates that would result a after aggregating averaging in time 696 time series with h 0 75 and length of 365 000 days to 100 years and b randomly selecting a 100 year interval of 696 time series with h 0 75 and length 10 000 years assuming that the data have been already deseasonalized and hence no periodicities exist the comparison suggests that both simulations result in different distributions and this makes sample size bias a highly unlikely explanation fig 2 a another plausible explanation could involve the hypothesis that ltp changes with temporal scale as suggested for precipitation pelletier and turcotte 1997 markonis and koutsoyiannis 2016 furthermore the entire dataset has been reproduced by both fgn and ar 1 stochastic processes to determine the sensitivity in the h estimation the three different simulations actual record length 500 years and 1000 years present significant distance between the 0 05 and 0 95 quantiles of h estimates for each individual station fig 2c which decreases with record length as the theory dictates from 0 23 of actual length to 0 07 for 1000 years of data the uncertainty is impressive even for the 1000 year sample and is the same for both fgn and ar processes however since the sample size consists of almost 700 time series the estimation of global mean of h should not deviate significantly from a value close to 0 65 similar results have been obtained by the periodogram estimation of h fig 2d notably the values of hurst coefficient below 0 5 are fewer with this approximation to verify that they do not emerge due to some anti persistent process but also due to the uncertainty in h estimation the deseasonalised monthly records were analysed where available and it was observed that most of them appeared to be in the 0 5 0 55 interval finally hurst coefficient was estimated for 100 different 696 record synthetic datasets produced by simple ar 1 processes with same length first and second order statistics and short term lag 1 correlation of observations the estimated h was found to be h lsv h whi h mle 0 64 0 64 0 62 which is very close to the empirical estimates application of the mann whitney wilcoxon test shows that 30 in 100 datasets are sampled from different populations at p 0 99 significance and 70 in 100 at p 95 as the difference in h estimation is so small and the statistical test results so marginal we cannot reject the short term persistence hypothesis to investigate this behaviour further we have estimated the autocorrelation coefficients for the first three lags and compared them with ar 1 and ltp synthetic time series similarly to iliopoulou et al 2016 again the results suggest that it is very difficult to distinguish whether the streamflow can be described by a short or long term model at least for these record lengths fig 2b 3 2 linear correlations the matrix of the spearman s rank correlation coefficients confirms the robustness of the chosen estimation methods fig 3 all of them appear to be strongly correlated to each other and to the lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient ρ 1 the latter is expected due to the relationship between h and the autocorrelation function beran 1994 but also allows us to assume any relationships found between h and the investigated parameters will be also valid for the lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient in other words our results can be extended for simple auto regressive models τhe cross correlations between h or ρ 1 and the other associated parameters are quite weak it can be easily seen that the strongest one is with aridity index 0 28 0 32 and the catchment area 0 23 0 27 the latter has also been reported by previous studies mudelsee 2007 hirpa et al 2010 szolgayova et al 2014 other even smaller correlations include mean streamflow and its coefficient of variance skewness mean precipitation and potential evaporation all of them though have been estimated to be statistically significant at p value 99 by monte carlo simulation 1000 iterations to assess the uneven distribution of stations over europe and n america and also check for any other similar biases due to the sample spatial heterogeneity were estimated the correlation matrix after reducing the sample size of stations at n hemisphere mid latitudes to 30 to match the records in the other latitude zones see table 1 to assure consistency 100 repetitions in the random sampling of the stations over europe and n america were performed again the hurst coefficient was most correlated with the catchment area but this time the mean flow raised to equal values while streamflow variance and skewness were close to zero longitude retained its high values as well as most of the other variables with mean streamflow showing some stronger links with potential evaporation and precipitation variance since the catchment area seems to influence h most we further investigated 75 rivers with more than one station typically the downstream stations had higher values of h than their upstream counterparts which confirms the findings of mudelsee 2007 and hirpa et al 2010 yet the overall difference is 0 02 with standard deviation around 0 05 suggesting that more research is needed possibly taking also into account the complexity of the catchment topography the urbanization fraction jovanovic et al 2016 and the presence of lakes or reservoirs zhang et al 2012 finally the influence of climatic type according to köppen geiger classification could not be included since it is a categorical variable and it was explored separately by determining the mean h for each köppen geiger class with at least 10 values fig 4 no significant relationships were found except the fact the highest h 0 71 41 records value of hurst coefficient in humid continental climates dfa and the lowest h 0 58 13 records for humid continental climates with hot summers dsb both classes are members of the same broader category including the dfb h 0 64 137 records which has larger sample size further investigation did not show any other links to this deviance e g large small catchment area multi linear regression provides similar results to the cross correlation analysis with the best fitted linear model r 2 0 19 described below 3 h 0 42 0 05 log a 0 04 log q 0 14 c v where a is the catchment area q the streamflow and cv the streamflow coefficient of variation surprisingly here the aridity index and the climatic conditions in general do not seem to affect the hurst coefficient of mean annual streamflow a possible explanation is that the cross correlation between aridity and h could be an artifact produced by its weak correlation to catchment area fig 3 and thus coincidental these kind of discrimination of the correlation strengths between different predictors is one of the strengths of multi linear regression gareth et al 2013 the impact of linearity assumption in the dependence structure between h and the associated variables can be seen by a simple explanatory example if the h estimates are subsetted by the catchment area then one can notice that the impact of catchment area becomes quite more profound for catchments above 211 km2 table 3 since the possibility of such relationships between h and other variables or their combination cannot be excluded the application of non linear approaches are also investigated 3 3 self organizing maps we used three different grids 6 6 10 10 and 14 14 and 20 000 repetitions in order to determine the most comprehensive som in terms of variables at first all the station attributes were included as input vectors and then were reduced gradually based on the results note that h was not included in the input vector set but it was estimated afterwards for each resulting group table 4 presents the initial output all variables it is obvious that this outcome is inconclusive as each group has similar properties actually the results are less informative compared to the correlation matrix approach as based on this grouping the relationship between ltp and catchment area is almost negligible however as we remove the variables that are less descriptive of the catchment properties such as sample size or present strong homogeneity elevation the classification scheme is improved table 5 now h is linked with the catchment area and a distinct representation of the geographical parameters emerges indeed if table 5 is compared with table 2 it can be seen as a crude estimate that group a corresponds to oceania group b to europe group c to nw america group d to ne america and group e to asia finally by removing the latitude and longitude and the potential evaporation coefficient of variance strongly anti correlated to potential evaporation we have a quite representative 10 10 feature map fig 5 group a consists of a small number of stations with medium catchment size low high variance streamflow and annual precipitation 2 5 times smaller than potential evaporation this feature combination seems to lead to the lowest range of h values table 6 it is important to note again that the hurst coefficient was not part of the classification process but it was independently estimated afterwards low ltp is also evident in group b approximately one fifth of total stations which contains the low area streamflow pluvial catchments on the other hand the highest h estimates are found at the largest high streamflow catchments groups e and f the latter is quite small and defragmented resembling group d in all variables but catchment size 3 4 random forests the last classification approach applied is the random forest technique one of its advantages is that categorical variables can be used as well therefore we have introduced to the above mentioned variables the koppen geiger climatic classes and the continents while the elevation and latitude variables were replaced by their corresponding categories as defined in table 1 the continent and latitude classes were used to avoid bias in classification due to the heterogeneity of sampling as discussed in the som method intermediate classification scheme the elevation class was replaced after the first algorithm runs to investigate whether a categorical variable could produce better results than a continuous one a sample of 2500 trees was used to grow the random forest and nine variables out of 14 were randomly picked at each step an example of a sample regression tree can be seen in fig 6 our resulting random forest though had 146 terminal nodes on average quite more than these presented in the example even in this shorter regression tree it can be seen that h values are partitioned quite discretely at the final nodes while catchment area and the newly introduced aridity index are found higher between the splits i e closer to the tree trunk catchment area and aridity index were found to be the best descriptors for hurst coefficient not only for single trees but also for the whole random forest according to all methods fig 7 in the first case the vimp method suggests that the aridity index is by far the most significant feature affecting h fig 7a however if the relationships between the variables are taken also into account then dr drops sharply and köppen geiger and continental classification rise fig 7b this behaviour is typical when interdependencies between the variables exist strobl et al 2008 this is because the significance of the weakest predictors is added to the significance of the stronger one kuhn and johnson 2013 the minimal depth method is also prone to this type of bias and its results are closer to simple vimp fig 7c besides the importance of catchment area and the ratio of precipitation to potential evaporation all three methods rank köppen geiger classification and coefficient of variance quite highly 4 discussion conclusions even though 70 years have passed since its first identification yet the true nature of ltp behaviour in geophysical processes remains elusive in the present study we have provided a global estimation of hurst coefficient in annual streamflow and an investigation of the factors potentially affecting it the mean value of the hurst coefficient is estimated close to 0 65 suggesting a weaker behaviour than previously assumed the strengths of our analysis are the number and the quality of the records used the estimation based on the most robust techniques for the determination of ltp according to the literature and the implementation of two promising techniques for non linear classification the two main limitations include the spatial heterogeneity of the stations the majority of records come from europe and n america and the short sample size in terms of absolute record values median around 90 the most significant implication for stochastic modelling risen from our results is that some of the most common estimators are insufficient to distinguish whether the underlying process is long term or short term persistence this can be seen even more clearly by a representative example fig 8 a where the distributions of h estimates of time series reproduced by fgn and ar 1 models that correspond to an individual record with h 0 76 used in the sensitivity analysis in section 3 1 fig 2c the distributions overlap each other almost entirely highlighting the discrimination problem and additionally when compared to the overall distribution of h estimates they can practically correspond to any type of process from white noise to strong long term persistence in our study since we have a large sample of time series 700 records we can be confident that the individual biases cancel each other averaging in the gaussian distributions of fig 1 according to the central limit theorem when individual or a small number of time series is examined attention should be paid and sensitivity analysis should always follow the results since the uncertainty in the estimation of hurst could be enormous in addition the discrimination issue is not remedied with longer record lengths fig 8b and c as discussed in the methods section even 1000 values of an ar 1 process with lag 1 autocorrelation ρ 0 4 result to h estimates close to 0 75 a possible way to cope with would to use graphical methods for getting more information about the scaling behaviour of the physical process e g see markonis and koutsoyiannis 2013 dimitriadis and koutsoyiannis 2015 pappas et al 2017 this approach could be hand for single or small number of records but it is not efficient for large datasets of data as the one presented in this study leaving space for the quest of appropriate graphical methods that could be applied in similar cases our other findings suggest that sample size latitude elevation and streamflow do not affect h estimates the non existent effect of sample size and elevation was also identified by szolgayova et al 2014 amongst them the small sample size has been theoretically linked with underestimation of hurst coefficient koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 papalexiou et al 2011 yet the few records available with more than 150 years do not correspond to higher h values we underline thought that most records have 80 and 120 years and any relationship with the sample size is tough to infer hence following the approach of papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 we investigate whether the hurst coefficient increases by partitioning the original records at certain lengths it can be seen that h retains a steady median at 0 62 independently of record length the mean is slightly increasing from 0 62 to 0 65 with a simultaneous increase of lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient from 0 21 to 0 25 figure 9 since h is relatively low the sample bias is also expected to be low and we could safely assume that there is no significant systematic underestimation of h in our analysis it cannot be ruled out though the possibility for a varying scaling law resulting to stronger ltp in larger time scales as the one observed in the behaviour of precipitation markonis and koutsoyiannis 2016 we can also see that the influence of catchment size on the hurst coefficient link is more evident in the bigger spatial scales whilst its contribution is minimal for smaller areas the effect of catchment area has also been detected in other studies mudelsee 2007 hirpa et al 2010 szolgayova et al 2014 our findings add to prior knowledge that its influence becomes evident in large spatial scales setting a threshold at 2 104 km in the smaller catchments climatic controls aridity index or total amount of precipitation appear to have larger impact in general we expect stronger ltp when potential evaporation equals precipitation and lower for greater amounts of precipitation we can say that when the values of the aridity index deviate strongly from unity then significant weakening of ltp is observed even at larger catchments all these relationships were similar for any ltp estimation method and any dataset quality class but still the uncertainty in the estimation of h hinders the derivation of a clear relationship at very dry regions group a of the som table 6 runoff is lower more sensitive to inter annual precipitation fluctuations harman et al 2011 and hence has higher coefficient of variance fig 9d on the other hand very wet regions commonly have no distinct low flow season which increases the short term variability szolgayova et al 2014 in both cases if the catchment area is small to medium then the catchment features might have minimal effect to the transformation of precipitation to streamflow then the autocorrelation structure of streamflow should resemble the one of precipitation which is described by h values around 0 6 markonis et al 2017 tyralis et al 2017 this could also explain why ltp is so weaker in humid continental climates with hot summers dsb as found in the investigation for linear correlations section 3 2 in any case since our results suggest that there is a link between catchment size and the autocorrelation function future research could aim to clarify whether this stems from the aggregation of the precipitation or from the catchment features e g topographical complexity soil moisture storage type of land use vegetation etc we believe that these issues are going to be resolved in the near future as hydrological datasets are rapidly improving in terms of geographical extent and resolution in this data rich epoch self organizing maps and random forests present two good alternatives for big data classification at least as far as the present study is concerned concluding we showed that hurst coefficient for streamflow is significantly lower than estimates of other similar studies this could be related to the time resolution of the datasets and it remains to be seen whether this discrepancy between the daily and annual data implies a varying scaling regime across temporal scales or it is just an aggregation artifact most importantly we have presented some robust evidence that the most well known estimators of h fail to distinguish whether the underlying process is short or long term persistent in records of even 1000 values it is known that the existence of ltp and the properties of the autocorrelation structure in general affect slope significance smith 1993 cohn and lins 2005 return period volpi et al 2015 as well as the intervals between extremes altmann and kantz 2005 eichner et al 2007 thus the emergence of ltp in streamflow is inherently linked with water management koutsoyiannis et al 2012 when any statistical description or stochastic modelling approach is involved falsely accounting for ltp instead of stp in annual streamflow could lead to an overestimation of natural variability as well as an underestimation of the interval duration between extremes eichner et al 2007 thus caution should be given in the selection of the appropriate stochastic model in water resources management contributions yma conceived the idea and wrote the manuscript smp yma designed

851,long term persistence ltp of annual river runoff is a topic of ongoing hydrological research due to its implications to water resources management here we estimate its strength measured by the hurst coefficient h in 696 annual globally distributed streamflow records with at least 80 years of data we use three estimation methods maximum likelihood estimator whittle estimator and least squares variance resulting in similar mean values of h close to 0 65 subsequently we explore potential factors influencing h by two linear spearman s rank correlation multiple linear regression and two non linear self organizing maps random forests techniques catchment area is found to be crucial for medium to larger watersheds while climatic controls such as aridity index have higher impact to smaller ones our findings indicate that long term persistence is weaker than found in other studies suggesting that enhanced ltp is encountered in large catchment rivers were the effect of spatial aggregation is more intense however we also show that the estimated values of h can be reproduced by a short term persistence stochastic model such as an auto regressive ar 1 process a direct consequence is that some of the most common methods for the estimation of h coefficient might not be suitable for discriminating short and long term persistence even in long observational records keywords river runoff long term persistence long range dependence self organizing maps random forests catchment classification 1 introduction long term persistence ltp also known as long range dependence was introduced by harold edwin hurst 1951 as a statistical behaviour of the nile flow that could not be described by the established statistical theory of that time unknown to him kolmogorov 1940 had already developed its mathematical formulation which was acknowledged many years later to a robust mathematical framework by mandelbrot and wallis 1968 since then ltp has been not only an elementary component of stochastic hydrology montanari 2003 but also identified in many other geophysical biological and artificial times series o connell et al 2016 and references therein the most intriguing property of long term persistence is the multi scale deviations of the local mean which might lead to intense slopes and or clustering of the extremes the latter has been often expressed as the tendency of low values to follow low ones and high values to succeed high ones the former implies that slope significance would be overestimated in a time series exhibiting ltp smith 1993 cohn and lins 2005 and therefore appropriate statistical test should be used such the one suggested by hamed 2008 in addition it became apparent that to determine accurately its magnitude long records of data are needed because ltp might mask its true behaviour in shorter lengths koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 as a rule the stronger the ltp the longer the time series record needed during the last decades a few studies have further investigated this phenomenon in streamflow the largest one in terms of number of records analysed was performed by pelletier and turcotte 1997 who studied 636 deseasonalized monthly records in the united states with length greater than 40 years supporting the evidence of medium ltp in river runoff other researchers presented similar results e g kantelhardt et al 2006 studied 42 long daily runoff records from all over the world average 77 years wang et al 2007 investigated 31 stations with daily data and at least 30 years over europe and n america and bogachev and bunde 2012 analysed 20 long records above 100 years from europe the recent studies cover also european serinaldi et al 2014 szolgayova et al 2014 and n american rivers serinaldi and kilsby 2016 showing strong variability in the strength of ltp behaviour ranging from very weak to extremely intense which could be due to the large uncertainty in its determination even for long records beran 1994 this large variability of ltp was investigated by szolgayova et al 2014 in terms of catchment attributes such as catchment area mean annual temperature and precipitation elevation mean discharge specific mean discharge and seasonality amongst them catchment area was found to be the most significant one confirming previous studies mudelsee 2007 hirpa et al 2010 other factors that have been found to enhance ltp behaviour is the existence of lakes and or dams zhang et al 2012 while the degree of catchment urbanization potentially abates it jovanovic et al 2016 the above studies are based on a relatively small number of records and thus their results need to be further explored here we attempt to extend past and contemporary research at a global scale by using 696 annual river runoff records with at least 80 years from the global runoff data base grdb global runoff data centre 2016 the data records were checked for inconsistencies through visual inspection and algorithmic testing and a quality index was assigned to each one of them we use three well established methods for the estimation of ltp i e maximum likelihood estimator whittle estimator and least squares variance finally we explore possible links of ltp behaviour with various streamflow and catchment attributes by implementing linear spearman s rank correlation multiple linear regression and non linear self organizing maps random forests techniques to continuous and categorical variables 2 data methods 2 1 dataset quality control from the original grdb comprising 9252 stations 4070 rivers we initially selected 815 time series from 605 rivers with mean streamflow above 1 m3 s sample sizes above 80 years and missing value intervals below 10 years the metadata of the records were not available and common homogenization techniques are inadequate for hydrological data kundzewicz and robson 2000 especially when there are long term fluctuations which might be falsely identified as artificial breakpoints of the mean rybski and neumann 2011 therefore a visual inspection procedure was followed to verify data quality on a one by one basis to three quality classes a b and c and a final data set of 696 records markonis et al 2018 other gridded datasets used were cru ts3 22 1900 2012 for precipitation harris and jones 2014 princeton global pdsi 1948 2008 for potential evaporation sheffield et al 2012 and the köppen geiger global classification of kottek et al 2006 for the years 1951 2000 the means of precipitation and potential evaporation were estimated for the whole period in 2 5 2 5 spatial resolution the same resolution was applied to the köppen geiger classes in terms of the most encountered class per grid cell here we assume that this resolution can be regarded representative for the majority of the catchments keeping in mind though that they could be biased for the largest smallest watersheds finally we have estimated the potential evaporation to precipitation ratio as a representative measure of the catchment s dryness aridity index in table 1 the basic attributes of the final dataset consisting of 696 stations are presented an interactive map of the the dataset information along with the corresponding classifications quality flags and analysis results can be found at https shiny fzp czu cz kvhem riversltp 2 2 estimation of ltp long term persistence is determined by the hurst coefficient h 0 1 which links the standard deviation σ at unit time scale with that at the temporal scale k by 1 σ k k h 1 σ where σ k is the standard deviation of the process at scale k a stochastic process with h greater than smaller than or equal to 0 5 is characterized respectively as persistence anti persistence or white noise hurst coefficient can be estimated based on several methods as the results of numerous comparisons on their efficiency suggest taqqu et al 1995 stroe kunold et al 2009 rea et al 2009 tyralis and koutsoyiannis 2011 witt and malamud 2013 dimitriadis and koutsoyiannis 2015 here we apply the maximum likelihood estimation mle hipel and mcleod 1994 the whittle estimator beran 1994 and the least square variance method lsv tyralis and koutsoyiannis 2011 which have been found to be more robust and present similar biases in relatively small sample sizes the detrended fluctuation analysis dfa technique which has been used in some previous studies matsoukas et al 2000 kantelhardt et al 2006 hirpa et al 2010 bogachev and bunde 2012 has not been chosen due to recent findings of biases in its results bryce and sprague 2012 höll and kantz 2015 lovsletten 2016 although all the chosen methods are ranked high in most benchmark studies we should keep in mind that all of them assume that the underlying process exhibits ltp and have poor results when estimating h for simple autoregressive processes papalexiou et al 2010 serinaldi and kilsby 2016 for example an ar 1 process this means h 0 5 with lag 1 autocorrelation ρ 0 4 and sample size equal to 1000 values gives h lsv h whi h mle 0 77 0 76 0 72 estimated by monte carlo simulation 1000 iterations of synthetic ltp time series thus the ltp estimators are prone to type ii error i e not rejecting a false null hypothesis existence of ltp and the alternative hypothesis that the estimated h arise from short term persistence should also be examined to this end 1000 synthetic time series from a markovian model ar 1 were produced with mean standard deviation autocorrelation coefficient and sample size equal to the empirical record and we determined h using the same three methods its statistical significance was measured by the non parametric mann whitney wilcoxon test to determine if the underlying process is in fact a short term persistence process finally the effect of record size has been also depicted combined with sensitivity analysis to determine the 0 9 confidence interval of estimates h at each station again the monte carlo approach has been chosen to create 1000 random replicates of each time series by the fractional gaussian noise fgn and ar 1 process and the h estimates were compared between actual record length 500 and 1000 years the h estimates have been also validated versus the periodogram approach which has been shown to be more efficient in smaller sample sizes taqqu et al 1995 caballero et al 2002 as the finite size effect is quite stronger in variance methods lennartz and bunde 2009 2 3 linear and non linear correlations the initial streamflow catchment parameters chosen to be examined were geographical location catchment area log transformed average annual streamflow log transformed elevation annual precipitation potential evaporation köppen geiger classification and record length we have used two linear and two non linear statistical methods for the exploration of the dependence between these attributes and hurst coefficient unless otherwise stated the mle estimates were used initially the spearman s rank correlation was used we have also used the resulting correlation matrix to discriminate the most evident dependencies and further investigate the associated variables via multiple linear regression and produce a linear model of the form 2 h a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a n x n ɛ where a i are the model coefficients xi the correlated variables and ε the error term for the selection of the optimal number of variables a mixed selection procedure was followed as described by gareth et al 2013 in addition to traditional statistical methods during the last decades many non linear iterative techniques have been developed for classification purposes self organizing maps soms is a dimension reduction technique similar to principal component analysis used for feature extraction and cluster analysis kohonen 1982 the som approach projects the data space onto a usually two dimensional grid preserving their topological structure hence enlightening visualizations of the data space can be created not only presenting the clusters with similar features but also their relative relationships although classification techniques have not been common in hydrology mcdonnell and woods 2004 during the last years soms have been successfully implemented in an increasing number of studies hall and minns 1999 hsu et al 2002 moradkhani et al 2004 lin and chen 2006 chang et al 2010 hsu and li 2010 ley et al 2011 tiwari et al 2013 toth 2013 a detailed description of the algorithm and its properties is described by kohonen 2001 while a review of the som approach in water resources has been presented by kalteh et al 2008 random forests have also recently shown some promising results in hydrological applications booker and snelder 2012 chen et al 2012 booker and woods 2014 naghibi et al 2016 li et al 2016 this technique is based on the regression tree algorithm which uses a tree structure to split the dataset into homogenous partitions by following some splitting rule e g minimizing the variance of a given set of variables then an ensemble of different regression trees is created by bootstrapping the original sample and permuting the set of variables breiman 2001 the significance of each variable can be quantified through the variable importance vimp and minimal depth md measures variable importance takes advantage of the out of bag data to estimate the difference in the predictive ability of the random forest if any one of the randomly picked variables is replaced by another in minimal depth the variables that partition larger samples of the population more frequently are assumed to describe the dataset more sufficiently these variables are found at the first node levels of the tree i e nearest to its trunk the minimal depth is estimated by averaging the relative distance of the first split of each variable from the trunk for the whole forest breiman 2001 yet the vimp measure can be biased when the input variables are correlated or do not share a common scale or number of categories kuhn and johnson 2013 and therefore to remedy this issue the cforest algorithm was also applied strobl et al 2008 all the analyses and the presentation of results have been performed using the statistical software r r core team 2016 the algorithms for the h coefficient estimation were applied through the packages fgn mcleod and veenstra 2015 hkprocess tyralis 2015 and fractal constantine and percival 2016 the som algorithm is applied through package the kohonen wehrens and buydens 2007 while for the random forests the randomforest liaw and wiener 2015 and party hothorn et al 2017 packages were used 3 results 3 1 long term persistence the hurst coefficient was found between 0 3 and 1 fig 1 and in agreement among each method in terms of mean h lsv h whi h mle 0 65 0 65 0 63 and standard deviation σ lsv σ whi σ mle 0 097 0 094 0 095 the estimates for records of the a quality see markonis et al 2018 fall to h lsv h whi h mle 0 63 0 63 0 61 with the other categories retaining higher values table 2 this is expected since potential anthropogenic influences or biases in time series homogeneity introduce shifts in mean and trends which could increase h salas et al 1979 bhattacharya et al 1983 zhang et al 2012 another factor that could affect the determination of h is the heterogeneity in the geographical distribution of the stations it is obvious table 1 that the majority of the stations are located at northern mid latitudes namely at europe and n america however there is no significant deviation in the estimation of h per continent or latitude category table 2 with a mean equal to 0 65 if averaged by continent excluding south america due to small sample size or 0 64 if averaged by latitude category these h values are lower compared to other studies e g szolgayova et al 2014 suggest that most of the european stations have h 0 8 kantelhardt et al 2006 estimate a mean h value close to 0 72 while other studies advocate for 0 75 0 8 pelletier and turcotte 1997 bogachev and bunde 2012 all previous works have used deseasonalized daily or monthly data resulting to sample sizes ranging between 103 and 105 significantly larger compared to this study and it is known that sample size is a crucial factor for the unbiased determination of ltp e g see koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 and that methods which estimate h through variance show strong finite size effects lennartz and bunde 2009 to determine if this could be a potential factor for underestimation of hurst coefficient a series of monte carlo simulations have been performed initially we compared the distributions of h estimates that would result a after aggregating averaging in time 696 time series with h 0 75 and length of 365 000 days to 100 years and b randomly selecting a 100 year interval of 696 time series with h 0 75 and length 10 000 years assuming that the data have been already deseasonalized and hence no periodicities exist the comparison suggests that both simulations result in different distributions and this makes sample size bias a highly unlikely explanation fig 2 a another plausible explanation could involve the hypothesis that ltp changes with temporal scale as suggested for precipitation pelletier and turcotte 1997 markonis and koutsoyiannis 2016 furthermore the entire dataset has been reproduced by both fgn and ar 1 stochastic processes to determine the sensitivity in the h estimation the three different simulations actual record length 500 years and 1000 years present significant distance between the 0 05 and 0 95 quantiles of h estimates for each individual station fig 2c which decreases with record length as the theory dictates from 0 23 of actual length to 0 07 for 1000 years of data the uncertainty is impressive even for the 1000 year sample and is the same for both fgn and ar processes however since the sample size consists of almost 700 time series the estimation of global mean of h should not deviate significantly from a value close to 0 65 similar results have been obtained by the periodogram estimation of h fig 2d notably the values of hurst coefficient below 0 5 are fewer with this approximation to verify that they do not emerge due to some anti persistent process but also due to the uncertainty in h estimation the deseasonalised monthly records were analysed where available and it was observed that most of them appeared to be in the 0 5 0 55 interval finally hurst coefficient was estimated for 100 different 696 record synthetic datasets produced by simple ar 1 processes with same length first and second order statistics and short term lag 1 correlation of observations the estimated h was found to be h lsv h whi h mle 0 64 0 64 0 62 which is very close to the empirical estimates application of the mann whitney wilcoxon test shows that 30 in 100 datasets are sampled from different populations at p 0 99 significance and 70 in 100 at p 95 as the difference in h estimation is so small and the statistical test results so marginal we cannot reject the short term persistence hypothesis to investigate this behaviour further we have estimated the autocorrelation coefficients for the first three lags and compared them with ar 1 and ltp synthetic time series similarly to iliopoulou et al 2016 again the results suggest that it is very difficult to distinguish whether the streamflow can be described by a short or long term model at least for these record lengths fig 2b 3 2 linear correlations the matrix of the spearman s rank correlation coefficients confirms the robustness of the chosen estimation methods fig 3 all of them appear to be strongly correlated to each other and to the lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient ρ 1 the latter is expected due to the relationship between h and the autocorrelation function beran 1994 but also allows us to assume any relationships found between h and the investigated parameters will be also valid for the lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient in other words our results can be extended for simple auto regressive models τhe cross correlations between h or ρ 1 and the other associated parameters are quite weak it can be easily seen that the strongest one is with aridity index 0 28 0 32 and the catchment area 0 23 0 27 the latter has also been reported by previous studies mudelsee 2007 hirpa et al 2010 szolgayova et al 2014 other even smaller correlations include mean streamflow and its coefficient of variance skewness mean precipitation and potential evaporation all of them though have been estimated to be statistically significant at p value 99 by monte carlo simulation 1000 iterations to assess the uneven distribution of stations over europe and n america and also check for any other similar biases due to the sample spatial heterogeneity were estimated the correlation matrix after reducing the sample size of stations at n hemisphere mid latitudes to 30 to match the records in the other latitude zones see table 1 to assure consistency 100 repetitions in the random sampling of the stations over europe and n america were performed again the hurst coefficient was most correlated with the catchment area but this time the mean flow raised to equal values while streamflow variance and skewness were close to zero longitude retained its high values as well as most of the other variables with mean streamflow showing some stronger links with potential evaporation and precipitation variance since the catchment area seems to influence h most we further investigated 75 rivers with more than one station typically the downstream stations had higher values of h than their upstream counterparts which confirms the findings of mudelsee 2007 and hirpa et al 2010 yet the overall difference is 0 02 with standard deviation around 0 05 suggesting that more research is needed possibly taking also into account the complexity of the catchment topography the urbanization fraction jovanovic et al 2016 and the presence of lakes or reservoirs zhang et al 2012 finally the influence of climatic type according to köppen geiger classification could not be included since it is a categorical variable and it was explored separately by determining the mean h for each köppen geiger class with at least 10 values fig 4 no significant relationships were found except the fact the highest h 0 71 41 records value of hurst coefficient in humid continental climates dfa and the lowest h 0 58 13 records for humid continental climates with hot summers dsb both classes are members of the same broader category including the dfb h 0 64 137 records which has larger sample size further investigation did not show any other links to this deviance e g large small catchment area multi linear regression provides similar results to the cross correlation analysis with the best fitted linear model r 2 0 19 described below 3 h 0 42 0 05 log a 0 04 log q 0 14 c v where a is the catchment area q the streamflow and cv the streamflow coefficient of variation surprisingly here the aridity index and the climatic conditions in general do not seem to affect the hurst coefficient of mean annual streamflow a possible explanation is that the cross correlation between aridity and h could be an artifact produced by its weak correlation to catchment area fig 3 and thus coincidental these kind of discrimination of the correlation strengths between different predictors is one of the strengths of multi linear regression gareth et al 2013 the impact of linearity assumption in the dependence structure between h and the associated variables can be seen by a simple explanatory example if the h estimates are subsetted by the catchment area then one can notice that the impact of catchment area becomes quite more profound for catchments above 211 km2 table 3 since the possibility of such relationships between h and other variables or their combination cannot be excluded the application of non linear approaches are also investigated 3 3 self organizing maps we used three different grids 6 6 10 10 and 14 14 and 20 000 repetitions in order to determine the most comprehensive som in terms of variables at first all the station attributes were included as input vectors and then were reduced gradually based on the results note that h was not included in the input vector set but it was estimated afterwards for each resulting group table 4 presents the initial output all variables it is obvious that this outcome is inconclusive as each group has similar properties actually the results are less informative compared to the correlation matrix approach as based on this grouping the relationship between ltp and catchment area is almost negligible however as we remove the variables that are less descriptive of the catchment properties such as sample size or present strong homogeneity elevation the classification scheme is improved table 5 now h is linked with the catchment area and a distinct representation of the geographical parameters emerges indeed if table 5 is compared with table 2 it can be seen as a crude estimate that group a corresponds to oceania group b to europe group c to nw america group d to ne america and group e to asia finally by removing the latitude and longitude and the potential evaporation coefficient of variance strongly anti correlated to potential evaporation we have a quite representative 10 10 feature map fig 5 group a consists of a small number of stations with medium catchment size low high variance streamflow and annual precipitation 2 5 times smaller than potential evaporation this feature combination seems to lead to the lowest range of h values table 6 it is important to note again that the hurst coefficient was not part of the classification process but it was independently estimated afterwards low ltp is also evident in group b approximately one fifth of total stations which contains the low area streamflow pluvial catchments on the other hand the highest h estimates are found at the largest high streamflow catchments groups e and f the latter is quite small and defragmented resembling group d in all variables but catchment size 3 4 random forests the last classification approach applied is the random forest technique one of its advantages is that categorical variables can be used as well therefore we have introduced to the above mentioned variables the koppen geiger climatic classes and the continents while the elevation and latitude variables were replaced by their corresponding categories as defined in table 1 the continent and latitude classes were used to avoid bias in classification due to the heterogeneity of sampling as discussed in the som method intermediate classification scheme the elevation class was replaced after the first algorithm runs to investigate whether a categorical variable could produce better results than a continuous one a sample of 2500 trees was used to grow the random forest and nine variables out of 14 were randomly picked at each step an example of a sample regression tree can be seen in fig 6 our resulting random forest though had 146 terminal nodes on average quite more than these presented in the example even in this shorter regression tree it can be seen that h values are partitioned quite discretely at the final nodes while catchment area and the newly introduced aridity index are found higher between the splits i e closer to the tree trunk catchment area and aridity index were found to be the best descriptors for hurst coefficient not only for single trees but also for the whole random forest according to all methods fig 7 in the first case the vimp method suggests that the aridity index is by far the most significant feature affecting h fig 7a however if the relationships between the variables are taken also into account then dr drops sharply and köppen geiger and continental classification rise fig 7b this behaviour is typical when interdependencies between the variables exist strobl et al 2008 this is because the significance of the weakest predictors is added to the significance of the stronger one kuhn and johnson 2013 the minimal depth method is also prone to this type of bias and its results are closer to simple vimp fig 7c besides the importance of catchment area and the ratio of precipitation to potential evaporation all three methods rank köppen geiger classification and coefficient of variance quite highly 4 discussion conclusions even though 70 years have passed since its first identification yet the true nature of ltp behaviour in geophysical processes remains elusive in the present study we have provided a global estimation of hurst coefficient in annual streamflow and an investigation of the factors potentially affecting it the mean value of the hurst coefficient is estimated close to 0 65 suggesting a weaker behaviour than previously assumed the strengths of our analysis are the number and the quality of the records used the estimation based on the most robust techniques for the determination of ltp according to the literature and the implementation of two promising techniques for non linear classification the two main limitations include the spatial heterogeneity of the stations the majority of records come from europe and n america and the short sample size in terms of absolute record values median around 90 the most significant implication for stochastic modelling risen from our results is that some of the most common estimators are insufficient to distinguish whether the underlying process is long term or short term persistence this can be seen even more clearly by a representative example fig 8 a where the distributions of h estimates of time series reproduced by fgn and ar 1 models that correspond to an individual record with h 0 76 used in the sensitivity analysis in section 3 1 fig 2c the distributions overlap each other almost entirely highlighting the discrimination problem and additionally when compared to the overall distribution of h estimates they can practically correspond to any type of process from white noise to strong long term persistence in our study since we have a large sample of time series 700 records we can be confident that the individual biases cancel each other averaging in the gaussian distributions of fig 1 according to the central limit theorem when individual or a small number of time series is examined attention should be paid and sensitivity analysis should always follow the results since the uncertainty in the estimation of hurst could be enormous in addition the discrimination issue is not remedied with longer record lengths fig 8b and c as discussed in the methods section even 1000 values of an ar 1 process with lag 1 autocorrelation ρ 0 4 result to h estimates close to 0 75 a possible way to cope with would to use graphical methods for getting more information about the scaling behaviour of the physical process e g see markonis and koutsoyiannis 2013 dimitriadis and koutsoyiannis 2015 pappas et al 2017 this approach could be hand for single or small number of records but it is not efficient for large datasets of data as the one presented in this study leaving space for the quest of appropriate graphical methods that could be applied in similar cases our other findings suggest that sample size latitude elevation and streamflow do not affect h estimates the non existent effect of sample size and elevation was also identified by szolgayova et al 2014 amongst them the small sample size has been theoretically linked with underestimation of hurst coefficient koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 papalexiou et al 2011 yet the few records available with more than 150 years do not correspond to higher h values we underline thought that most records have 80 and 120 years and any relationship with the sample size is tough to infer hence following the approach of papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 we investigate whether the hurst coefficient increases by partitioning the original records at certain lengths it can be seen that h retains a steady median at 0 62 independently of record length the mean is slightly increasing from 0 62 to 0 65 with a simultaneous increase of lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient from 0 21 to 0 25 figure 9 since h is relatively low the sample bias is also expected to be low and we could safely assume that there is no significant systematic underestimation of h in our analysis it cannot be ruled out though the possibility for a varying scaling law resulting to stronger ltp in larger time scales as the one observed in the behaviour of precipitation markonis and koutsoyiannis 2016 we can also see that the influence of catchment size on the hurst coefficient link is more evident in the bigger spatial scales whilst its contribution is minimal for smaller areas the effect of catchment area has also been detected in other studies mudelsee 2007 hirpa et al 2010 szolgayova et al 2014 our findings add to prior knowledge that its influence becomes evident in large spatial scales setting a threshold at 2 104 km in the smaller catchments climatic controls aridity index or total amount of precipitation appear to have larger impact in general we expect stronger ltp when potential evaporation equals precipitation and lower for greater amounts of precipitation we can say that when the values of the aridity index deviate strongly from unity then significant weakening of ltp is observed even at larger catchments all these relationships were similar for any ltp estimation method and any dataset quality class but still the uncertainty in the estimation of h hinders the derivation of a clear relationship at very dry regions group a of the som table 6 runoff is lower more sensitive to inter annual precipitation fluctuations harman et al 2011 and hence has higher coefficient of variance fig 9d on the other hand very wet regions commonly have no distinct low flow season which increases the short term variability szolgayova et al 2014 in both cases if the catchment area is small to medium then the catchment features might have minimal effect to the transformation of precipitation to streamflow then the autocorrelation structure of streamflow should resemble the one of precipitation which is described by h values around 0 6 markonis et al 2017 tyralis et al 2017 this could also explain why ltp is so weaker in humid continental climates with hot summers dsb as found in the investigation for linear correlations section 3 2 in any case since our results suggest that there is a link between catchment size and the autocorrelation function future research could aim to clarify whether this stems from the aggregation of the precipitation or from the catchment features e g topographical complexity soil moisture storage type of land use vegetation etc we believe that these issues are going to be resolved in the near future as hydrological datasets are rapidly improving in terms of geographical extent and resolution in this data rich epoch self organizing maps and random forests present two good alternatives for big data classification at least as far as the present study is concerned concluding we showed that hurst coefficient for streamflow is significantly lower than estimates of other similar studies this could be related to the time resolution of the datasets and it remains to be seen whether this discrepancy between the daily and annual data implies a varying scaling regime across temporal scales or it is just an aggregation artifact most importantly we have presented some robust evidence that the most well known estimators of h fail to distinguish whether the underlying process is short or long term persistent in records of even 1000 values it is known that the existence of ltp and the properties of the autocorrelation structure in general affect slope significance smith 1993 cohn and lins 2005 return period volpi et al 2015 as well as the intervals between extremes altmann and kantz 2005 eichner et al 2007 thus the emergence of ltp in streamflow is inherently linked with water management koutsoyiannis et al 2012 when any statistical description or stochastic modelling approach is involved falsely accounting for ltp instead of stp in annual streamflow could lead to an overestimation of natural variability as well as an underestimation of the interval duration between extremes eichner et al 2007 thus caution should be given in the selection of the appropriate stochastic model in water resources management contributions yma conceived the idea and wrote the manuscript smp yma designed

852,microemulsions have found applications as carriers for the transport of solutes through various porous media they are commonly pre prepared in bulk form and then injected into the medium the preparation is done by actively mixing the surfactant water and oil and then allowing the mixture to stagnate until equilibrium is reached the resulting microemulsion characteristics of the surfactant oil water system are studied at equilibrium conditions and perfect mixing is assumed but in applications like subsurface remediation and enhanced oil recovery microemulsion formation may occur in the pore space surfactant solutions are injected into the ground to solubilize and or mobilize the non aqueous phase liquids napls by in situ emulsification flow dynamics and emulsification kinetics are coupled which also contributes to in situ mixing in this study we investigated the nature of such coupling for a quasi miscible fluid system in a conductive channel with dead end extensions a microfluidic setup was used where an aqueous solution of an anionic internal olefin sulfonate 20 24 ios surfactant was injected into n decane saturated glass micromodel the oil phase was coloured using a solvatochromatic dye allowing for direct visualization of the aqueous and oil phases as well as their microemulsions under fluorescent light presence of both conductive and stagnant dead end channels in a single pore system made it possible to isolate different transport mechanisms from each other but also allowed to study the transitions from one to the other in the conductive channel the surfactant was carried with flow and emulsification was controlled by the localized flow dynamics in the stagnant zones the driving force of the mass transfer was driven by the chemical concentration gradient some of the equilibrium phase behaviour characteristics of the surfactant oil water system were recognisable during the quasi miscible displacement however the equilibrium tests alone were not sufficient to predict the emulsification process under dynamic conditions keywords diffusion phase behaviour compositional gradient concentration gradient interfacial phenomena

also for geoscience applications miller 1988a baret et al 2009 in subsurface remediation harwell et al 1996 abriola et al 1993 agaoglu et al 2015 javanbakht et al 2017 and enhanced oil recovery processes aqueous solutions of surfactant are injected underground to dissolve and or mobilize the non aqueous phase initially in place healy and reed 1977 lake 1989 davies and jones 1968 chiou and shah 1981 in cases of ground water remediation the primary objective is to enhance the solubility of the oil i e winsor type i system abriola et al 1993 agaoglu et al 2015 javanbakht et al 2017 in a solubilization flood the aqueous concentration of the contaminant increases via micellar partitioning thereby reducing the number of pore volumes which is required to be pumped to extract the dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl however mobilization of the solubilized oil phase may not always be practical due to its high density optimal mobilization by winsor type iii microemulsions utilizes ultra low ift to significantly reduce the capillary forces trapping the dnapl and allow the non emulsified clean oil to be swept by the injected water in oil bearing reservoirs a large fraction of the oil remains in the reservoir following the waterflood lake 1989 davies and jones 1968 chiou and shah 1981 miller and raney 1993 tagavifar et al 2017 fletcher et al 2015 warren and calhoun 1955 furthermore up to 20 of this remaining oil saturation can be trapped in the dead end pores where there is no convective flow fatt 1961 in these situations the injected aqueous solutions of surfactant can create a nonequilibrium condition in the pore space high surfactant concentration in the highly conductive flowing channels and no surfactant in the non conductive ones de gennes 1983 lopez montilla et al 2002 battal et al 2003 miller 1988b solans et al 2016 equilibrium is eventually obtained by transfer of surfactant molecules from the bulk aqueous solution towards the oil water interface the ift decreases how low the ift will become depends on the phase behavior of the surfactant oil water system the salinity of the surfactant solution is one of the determining factors of which winsor type microemulsion will form at optimum salinity winsor iii microemulsions form with the lowest possible ultra low ift values the system can establish 1 10 2 mn m 1 winsor 1954 healy and reed 1976 healy and reed 1977 winsor type i microemulsion called the under optimum microemulsion forms at a lower salinity than the optimum salinity winsor type ii microemulsion forms at higher salinity than the optimum salinity is called the over optimum microemulsion the ift values generated by under and over optimum microemulsions are typically higher than the values occur in the presence of optimum salinity microemulsions however these values can still be ultra low the displacement can become quasi miscible highly over optimum microemulsions are not desirable in general as most of the surfactant partitions into the oil and very viscous emulsions can form which limit the oil recovery process efficiency lake 1989 unlike in the intravenous drugs and food products the subsurface applications require in situ formation of the microemulsion in absence of external stirring emulsification evolves through flow in the pore space where flow is stagnant and bulk liquid phases are not initially at equilibrium it is conceivable that certain dynamic processes such as diffusion thermal fluctuations or ultra low ift could lead to emulsification when the phases are brought in contact miller and raney 1993 detailed studies of spontaneous emulsification without externally applied shear clearly showed that shear can be internally created through marangoni stresses shahidzadeh et al 1999 in other words shear is always present either externally applied or internally created by the system itself due to the initially present compositional and associated ift gradients when ift is low enough marangoni stresses are sufficient to lead to breakup of interfaces and form emulsions spooner et al 2017 it is likely that this mechanism coupled with the flow field is relevant to the application of surfactants in subsurface applications lake 1989 chiou and shah 1981 tagavifar et al 2017 fletcher et al 2015 the oil recovery efficiency of a surfactant solution in porous media relies on the emulsification kinetics and the flow dynamics which ultimately raises the question how relevant the equilibrium phase behaviour studies are for the flow systems laboratory lake 1989 chiou and shah 1981 miller and raney 1993 tagavifar et al 2017 fletcher et al 2015 and field scale warren and calhoun 1955 studies of oil recovery by surfactant flooding have demonstrated that the micellar solubilization can be rate limited the oil solubilization rate was found to be dependent on the ift between the oil and the formation injection water as well as the injection water velocity which determines the rate of surfactant delivery therefore the injection conditions flow characteristics of the fluids and the topology of the pore space become important tagavifar et al 2017 fatt 1961 in order to address the question on how flow and emulsification kinetics are coupled we performed a microfluidic study using an aqueous solution of olefin sulfonate surfactant and n decane the pore space was etched in a glass chip and composed of a main flow channel with dead end extensions the surfactant solution was injected into the n decane saturated micromodel the quasi miscible flow mimicking the key characteristics of oleic phase mobilization in dead end pores was studied the oil phase was coloured with a fluorescent solvatochromatic dye which allowed for the visualization of aqueous and oil phases and their microemulsions under fluorescent light the resolution of the camera was not high enough for identification of marangoni effects on in situ shear generation and consequent emulsification berg 2009 edery et al 2018 however the resolution was sufficient to identify the different transport mechanisms in stagnant and conductive channels in this paper the emulsification term was used for microemulsion formation the term microemulsion was used to represent the emulsion phases irrespective of their composition and mechanism of formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 fluids a model fluid system that forms a microemulsion at ambient conditions was used the surfactant was anionic and was an internal olefin sulfonate ios with a distribution of 20 24 carbon atoms c20 24 barnes et al 2010 howe et al 2015 it is used in the eor applications and is produced by shell chemicals enordet o series the surfactant solutions were prepared by mixing the 4 surfactant 5 cosolvent 2 butanol sigma aldrich 99 0 purity and salt nacl in deionized di water nacl concentration varied for a salinity scan all concentrations were in weight percent w w the oil used in the experiments was n decane n c10 and was purchased from sigma aldrich usa 99 0 purity the surfactant and co solvent concentrations used in this study were higher than the typical values used in field applications however with high chemical concentrations the formation of microemulsion was quicker and higher in quantity which made the visualization and image analysis easier 2 2 equilibrium phase behaviour studies the phase behaviour of the current surfactant oil water system was analysed as a function of salinity at room temperature aqueous solutions of surfactant and co solvent were prepared the salinity of the solutions was varied by adding nacl the salinity varied between 1 6 and 2 0 nacl for each salinity a 15 ml vt test tube was prepared which consisted of 7 5 ml of surfactant solution and 7 5 ml of n decane mixing ratio of 1 1 the contents of the tubes were shaken vigorously and the tubes were left stagnate as the phases separated under the influence of gravity once equilibrated the microemulsion phase formed a middle layer that contained most of the surfactant and some water and oil the solubilisation was analysed by visually inspecting the test tubes under light the emulsion inversion point at which the phase behaviour changes between different winsor types was determined based on the hydrophilic lipophilic deviation hld theory salager et al 1979 salager et al 2004 in all salinity scan tubes a separate microemulsion phase was identified fig 1 a the optimum salinity where the winsor iii microemulsion formed was at 1 8 nacl concentration at which the surfactant had equal solubility in oil and aqueous phases approximately half of the microemulsion was below the middle line of the tube vw and the other half was above the middle line in the oil phase vo overall 40 of vt was microemulsion vme fig 1b salinity values below 1 8 were referred to as the under optimum and higher than the 1 8 were referred to as over optimum salinity for example the surfactant oil water system showed under optimum behaviour at 1 6 nacl concentration and over optimum behaviour at 2 0 nacl concentration the equilibration time for under optimum and optimum salinity tubes were similar within one hour the middle phases formed there were no visible changes in the composition of the tube content afterwards the over optimum salinity tubes took significantly longer the lower and the upper boundaries of the microemulsion layer could be identified after at least three hours or more the phase behaviour of the surfactant oil water system was further studied with different 2 butanol surfactant concentration ratios m broens 2015 as m increased microemulsion formation was quicker i e boundaries of the middle microemulsion layer became visible in the test tube however opacity of the middle microemulsion phase increased with reducing m for example m 2 5 system 5 2 butanol and 2 surfactant had emulsification times of 15 mins for optimum salinity m 1 25 5 2 butanol and 4 surfactant system had emulsification times of approximately 1 h for optimum salinity both m 2 5 and m 1 25 systems had transparent microemulsions at optimum salinity where m 1 0 625 2 5 2 butanol and 4 surfactant and in cases where the surfactant solution contained no 2 butanol the emulsification took significantly longer i e 1 day for optimum salinity furthermore the microemulsion was very opaque rather milky 2 3 interfacial tension measurements using a spinning drop tensiometer svt 20 dataphysics germany ift between the microemulsion and the aqueous layer was measured the sample holder of the tensiometer was a glass capillary with 5 mm inner diameter the capillary was open at one end to introduce the aliquot samples of equilibrated microemulsion and the aqueous phase bottom layer in each salinity tube was drawn using a syringe needle the glass capillary was first filled with the aqueous phase and then a drop of microemulsion was carefully placed in it the open end of the capillary was closed with a screw cap and the capillary was placed in the measuring chamber of the tensiometer the measurements were taken at different spin rates i e 1000 1500 2000 rpm until a steady reading was obtained at each rate using the camera of the set up photos of the microemulsion drop was taken and the ift value was determined based on the drop shape all ift values were ultra low i e below 1 10 2 mn m 1 fig 2 the ift between n decane and water no surfactant was significantly higher 43 mn m 1 10 20 measurements per system were taken at each spinning rate and none of the readings was excluded because they were too high low the noise in the ift measurements may be due to various reasons impurities in the chemicals is one of them the colour contrast between the microemulsion drop and the aqueous phase varied based on the salinity for the under optimum system the contrast was less therefore it was more difficult to obtain a stable reading this resulted in higher deviation in the readings for under optimum salinity values fig 2 1 6 and 1 7 nacl data points 2 4 viscosity measurements the microemulsion phase of each salinity tube was collected with a needle syringe the viscosity of the microemulsion was measured as a function of shear rate using a sinus ls300 couette principle rheometer prorheo germany the shear rates ranged between 1 and 100 s 1 the representative darcy scale shear rate was calculated using the canella equation for power law rheology teeuw and hesselink 1980 1 γ e q 3 n 1 n u 8 k ϕ where n is the power law index k is the permeability of the porous medium u is the darcy velocity and ϕ is the porosity of the porous medium the value of n indicates the degree of departure from newtonian behaviour the fluid is shear thinning for n 1 shear thickening for n 1 and newtonian for n 1 for a rock with permeability of 100 mdarcy and porosity of 0 20 a shear rate of 7 s 1 corresponds to a pore flow velocity of 1 ft day 1 this is a typical injection rate for an oil reservoir the microemulsion used in this study showed newtonian like behaviour and thus the value of n was set to 1 broens 2015 unsal et al 2016 the microemulsion viscosity was the lowest at optimum salinity the values increased as the salinity shifted from the optimum fig 3 shows the microemulsion viscosity values at 7 s 1 shear rate at room temperature at this temperature the viscosity of the bulk surfactant solution and n decane were 40 mpa s and 0 85 mpa s respectively 2 5 microfluidic experiments the pore geometry was etched in a glass microfluidic chip micronit the netherlands and composed of a main capillary channel with dead end extensions perpendicular to its axis fig 4 the main capillary was connected to a syringe pump harvard apparatus phd ultra uk at one end was open to the atmosphere at the other end the microfluidic chip was horizontally placed under the inverted fluorescence microscope leica dm6000 germany which could be operated with normal and fluorescent light the images were analysed using the leica qwin software leica germany experiments were performed at room temperature and it was assumed that there was no temperature gradient in the microfluidic chip the flow experiments started with oil saturated pore space saturation of the micromodel with oil was done in two stages first the micromodel was flushed with isopropanol which was more wetting than air it filled up the pore space including the dead end extensions then n decane was injected into the micromodel because isopropanol was soluble in n decane n decane eventually filled up the pore space the n decane was continuously injected in the micromodel for many pore volumes i e 100 s to ensure that the isopropanol was displaced completely the oil in the dead end extension was stagnant and represented the trapped oil once the micromodel was saturated with oil surfactant solution was injected emulsification took place as the injected surfactant solution encountered the oil the surfactant adsorption onto the glass surface was assumed negligible multiple channels were analysed in each micromodel experiment fig 4 channels 9 12 these channels were selected because they are in the centre of the micromodel away from the inlet and outlet of the micromodel to minimize the boundary condition effects 2 6 solvatochromatic fluorescent dye visualization of the microemulsion formation was viable by using a fluorescent solvatochromic dye named nile red cayman chemical company usa the cell based assay nile red solution was diluted with n decane 500 dilution by volume identification of oil and aqueous phases and their emulsions was possible under fluorescent light the oil and the microemulsion emitted amber and red colour respectively the aqueous phase did not emit any colour as no dye was solubilized in it it was confirmed that the dye did not affect the phase behaviour of the surfactant oil water system broens 2015 unsal et al 2016 2 7 photobleaching the fluorescence emitted is often observed to substantially decrease with time which is known as photobleaching in general the loss of fluorescence that comes along with photobleaching has the undesirable effect of reducing the signal to noise ratio and the quality of the collected images and data diaspro et al 2006 for example images which were taken at later stages of the same experiments emitted less fluorescence than the ones taken at earlier times this may have reflected on the image analysis findings nevertheless the experiments and the emulsification profiles of the same surfactant oil water systems were reproducible most of these observations on the fluorescent images of this study will be discussed on a qualitative basis they have been used to gain insights into the mobilization of the trapped oil phase by emulsification 3 experimental results 3 1 microfluidic experiments to mimic the oil mobilization by surfactant injection in a laboratory setting a series of flow experiments were performed table 1 lists the experiments which will be discussed in this paper results from under and over optimum salinity systems will be presented the optimum salinity 1 8 nacl system showed similar attributes to the under optimum system the images of the dead end pores were taken under fluorescent light and were further analysed the microemulsion saturation red area was plotted as a function of time to determine an emulsification rate for each salinity system two main assumptions here were that 1 dead end pores were not conductive to flow 2 mixing of two phases in a dead end was therefore not dominated by the macroscopic pressure gradient which drove the flow in the main channel the results will be discussed based on the observations made on one of the dead end extensions per experiment however we have analysed multiple channels fig 4 channels 9 12 in each micromodel experiment and the individual dead end channels followed the same trend 3 1 1 base case water injection in the base case experiment no surfactant was added in the injection water only di water was injected therefore the ift between n decane and water was relatively high 43 mn m 1 water was the wetting phase and it was injected into the coloured n decane saturated micromodel single frames from the experiment where the aqueous phase was injected at 10 nl min 1 are shown in fig 5 under fluorescent light the oil phase emitted amber colour the water phase was invisible black fig 5a the boundaries of the capillary channels are marked with dashed lines as the water invaded the main capillary it also began to imbibe into the dead end channel displacing oil no emulsification occurred due to absence of surfactant i e there were no red areas visible under fluorescent light the oil was expelled from the open face of the dead end pore in droplets oil production was counter current water imbibed in the dead end channel while the oil droplets moved in opposite direction towards the open face and into the main flow channel morrow and mason 2001 unsal et al 2009 the droplets were then carried away with the flow stream the oil droplet size range was 30 40 micrometer some drops merged into larger ones during the mobilization process the speed of drop generation was driven the rate at which the oil water meniscus advanced in the channel and this slowed with the distance that the interface had already travelled washburn effect unsal et al 2009 washburn 1921 this effect meant that successive drops were produced at ever slower rates after 12 hour injection nearly one third of the oil in the dead end channel was recovered by imbibing water because the channel had non circular cross section with corners a water film imbibed along the corners ahead of the main oil water interface fig 5b this suggested that there was water flow in the angular corners which resulted in continuous pressure gradient along the dead end channel upon continuing with the injection for 24 hours no additional oil was mobilized the oil water glass contact angle α was extracted from the images fig 5c the micromodel was water wet α was determined as 26 3 however it was not possible to confirm whether this value was for advancing or receding contact angle 3 1 2 surfactant solution injection additional microfluidic experiments were performed with surfactant solution as the injection fluid the experimental protocol was the same as in the base case the surfactant solution was injected in the oil saturated micromodel multiple experiments with under and over optimum salinity surfactant solution were performed to study the injection rate effect the surfactant solution was injected at 1 nl min 1 and 100 nl min 1 microemulsion formation and resulting phase distribution in the dead end pore was analysed under normal and fluorescent light fig 6 shows snapshots from experiment 2 where the under optimum surfactant solution was injected at 1 nl min 1 on the left fig 6a the multiple structures of different sizes are seen under normal light however it was not possible to identify different phases on the right fig 6b the light source was switched to fluorescent and phases became visible the amber area was the oil phase as the surfactant was carried to the dead end channel via the convective flow emulsification started orange and red patches the black round features were the surfactant solution which had not yet solubilized any oil it was ensured that there was no air trapped in the pore space see appendix the displaced oil either in clean amber or emulsified red form emerged from the dead end channel at point a this exit point was at the right bottom corner of the open face where the dead end connected to the main flow since the flow was from left to right in the main channel the fluid pressure was the highest on the left corner and decreased towards right corner consequently this corner was the easiest exit point for the displaced fluid note that in the main channel a stream of red emulsion phase was observed this amount was more than what was produced from a single dead end channel it was the emulsion phase produced from preceding dead end channels another observation was the presence of convective flow streams at the entrance of the dead end fig 6b the flow field slightly extended into the channel and generated mixing consequently instant emulsification it also helped to sweep clean and emulsified oil kambayi et al 2015 fig 7 shows sequential images of a dead end channels from three different experiments where surfactant solution was injected into the oil saturated micromodel top middle and bottom rows show snapshots from experiments 2 3 and 4 respectively the time between the individual images of the same experiments are marked on each image image 3 is from experiment 2 and was taken 2 5 hours after the snapshots given in fig 6 also images 1 2 of fig 7 this image shows more oil being solubilized as the emulsification advanced deeper into the channel furthermore at the very end of the dead end channel the angular corners were filled with red fluid it was likely that the surfactant solution travelled through the edges of the channel and already emulsified some oil images from experiment 3 can be seen in the 2nd row of fig 7 images 4 6 under optimum surfactant solution was injected at 100 nl min 1 after 9 minutes shown in image 5 some oil had already been swept away through the thin oil stream towards the right bottom corner the surfactant solution progressed further into the channel black front later a few detached red spots appeared ahead of the main emulsification front image 6 this suggested that the surfactant travelled via some diffusive processes similar to experiment 2 fig 7 image 3 the emulsification progressed through the dead end channel edges and reached the end of the channel ahead of the main emulsification front the main flow channel was filled mostly with red emulsion and some clean oil patches the oil phase carried in the main channel was believed to be the produced from the preceding dead end channels experiment 4 where the over optimum solution was injected at 100 nl min 1 is shown at the bottom row of fig 7 images 7 9 the emulsification pattern was different compared to the under optimum system at the same injection rate fig 7 2 nd row the emulsification started by formation of circular patches image 8 as it progressed the emulsification front became piston like image 9 at the end of the dead end channel a thick red film was also observed at the corners another observation in fig 7 was that the interface between the emulsion red and the oil phases amber appeared sharper in some images images 3 6 9 while it was more diffuse in others images 2 7 8 in fig 8 a and fig 8b close up images are provided for images 2 and 3 of fig 7 respectively to examine the oil emulsion interface in detail in general between two different phases there is a transition from one bulk phase to the other over a length scale associated with a compositional gradient the interface between the two bulk phases has an interfacial energy i e ift which is proportional to square of this compositional gradient cahn and hilliard 1958 anderson et al 1998 compositional variations between the bulk fluids in this study originated from variations in oil and water content and in chemical concentrations such as surfactant cosolvent and salt such variations were driven by the phase behaviour characteristics of the surfactant oil water system as well as the local flow dynamics from collected images of the dead end pores it was not possible to determine the exact compositions of the bulk phases or the ift values at the interfaces however the following discussion may explain some of the causality for qualitative differences in the observed interface characteristics in fig 8a the oil emulsion interface color transition from red to amber was not sharp point a this suggested that there was a low compositional gradient between the emulsion red and oil amber phases the surface energy i e ift was relatively low potentially ultra low in case of a composition close to optimum phase behaviour small droplets of emulsion phase with diffuse interface were also spotted fig 8b point c in fig 8b the oil emulsion interface color transition from red to amber appeared sharp point b following the compositional gradient argument it was likely that such gradient in this region was high resulting in higher ift values i e not ultra low the interface was also curved with an approximately constant curvature indicative of capillary dominated process which supported the argument of relatively high ift compared to fig 8a a sharp interface was also observed at the emulsion surfactant solution interface on both fig 8a point d e and 8b point f the black regions indicated the presence of excess surfactant solution which had not yet solubilized any oil the interface in fig 8b was rather flat and deformed through the influence of flow field suggesting that the ift was ultra low and the local capillary forces were negligible the reason for differences in compositional gradient at different regions in the same dead end channel could have been related to the rate at which the surfactant was delivered to each region the surfactant delivery rate was a function of the rate at which the surfactant solution was injected into the micromodel but also depended on the emulsification characteristics of the surfactant oil water system and the local flow dynamics in fig 8 the two images were taken in the same experiment fig 8b was 150 mins after than fig 8a the surfactant solution was injected at 1 nl min 1 at early times the emulsification front was relatively close to the open end where the fresh surfactant solution entered the dead end channel fig 8a δxd1 due to this proximity surfactant supply was initially abundant which allowed the emulsification front to propagate rapidly not allowing enough time for any equilibration this generated a wide zone of compositional change and a small compositional gradient in the emulsion phase consequently a very diffuse interface during the following 150 mins the emulsification front advanced further into the dead end channel and more oil was solubilized the emulsification rate slowed down for two reasons 1 the travel distance of the surfactant to the emulsification front increased fig 8b δxd2 2 surfactant had to pass through the existing emulsion phase and was partially consumed by it initially formed emulsion did not have an equilibrium composition and required more surfactant to evolve towards equilibrium this equilibration process resulted in more uniform composition in the emulsion phase and sharper interface larger compositional gradient between the emulsion and the oil phases it is also likely that there was a colour gradient over the sharp interface from red to green but the resolution of the camera was not sufficient to visualize it it is also important to mention the role of the counter current imbibition on the emulsification and surfactant delivery process the imbibition was continuous the surfactant solution imbibed in the dead end channel figure 8b on the left g while the produced phase emulsified non emulsified oil moved in opposite direction towards the open face figure 8b on the right h and into the main flow channel therefore in cases where an interface was visible it was not symmetrical left side was ahead of the right side fig 8b points b and f and it was also likely that the surfactant delivery was interfered by the flow in opposite directions 4 discussion 4 1 emulsification rate snapshots from the flow experiments taken under fluorescent light were analysed for an emulsification rate in the dead end channel the fractional area occupied by the red emulsion phase zones in the dead end channel was plotted against time fig 9 by the time the surfactant solution injection started and the first image of a dead end channel was taken for data analysis time zero some oil was already solubilized the linear regression fit was extended to project the start time of each experiment fig 9 dashed lines experiments 2 3 and 5 projections met approximately at the same point in time 400 s time 20 experiment 4 projection was approximately 100 s earlier than the others the observations were interpreted as follows under optimum profile deviated from the straight line at l nl min 1 particularly at earlier times fig 9 blue diamonds the deviation was less pronounced at 100 nl min 1 fig 9 green triangles the probable cause was that the surfactant supply to the dead end channel was not quick enough at the lower injection rate in other words emulsification was faster than the rate at which the surfactant was delivered into the dead end channel unlike the under optimum system at 1 nl min 1 the emulsification profile of the over optimum salinity fit the straight line better fig 9 red squares at over optimum salinity the surfactant had higher affinity to oil to form the microemulsion the surfactant molecules had to travel to the oil phase from the water phase in which they were initially solubilized this would take longer than formation of an under optimum microemulsion where the surfactant preferred to stay in the aqueous phase therefore supply rate of surfactant at 1 nl min 1 was probably more balanced with the delayed microemulsion formation rate at over optimum salinity the phase behaviour test also indicated that the over optimum surfactant oil water system reached equilibrium significantly slower than under optimum system section 2 2 at 100 nl min 1 the emulsification rates were higher than the ones at 1 nl min 1 at both salinity fig 9 see slopes of black circles and green triangles vs red squares and blue diamonds the linear fit was also better the overall linear fit suggested that there was a diffusion controlled mass transfer between the oil and the surfactant solution miller and raney 1993 ruschak and miller 1972 for both under and over optimum salinity solutions there were deviations from the straight line at very early times this was believed to be due to convective flow at the open face of the dead end channel the emulsion phase which formed at early times was swept away by the flow stream fig 7 images 5 6 8 as the emulsification advanced in the channel the emulsion phase was less impacted by the convective flow effect fig 7 images 3 and 9 the injection experiments were repeated with lower concentration system i e 0 5 surfactant the cosolvent concentration was kept the same i e 5 the emulsion volumes generated during the injection experiments were correlated with the volumes formed in the test tubes emulsion volume decreased with decreasing surfactant concentration broens 2015 even though the surfactant supply was compatible with the emulsification rate relatively small amount of emulsion formed therefore the fraction of the red zones was smaller than the experiment where the surfactant concentration was higher 4 2 diffusion rate when the phase mobilization is controlled by diffusive processes there are several parameters that control the diffusion rate among the parameters that must be considered when injecting a surfactant solution are the surfactant concentration nguyen et al 2007 wang et al 2009 the velocity of the injected solution wang et al 2009 and intermittent flow which delivers the surfactant to the oil water interface and sweeps the mobilized phase the rate of diffusion increases as the surfactant concentration gradient increases earlier studies showed that the mobilization of the trapped oleic phase was highly dependent on the concentration of the surfactant but was less influenced by the pore water velocity or the duration of the flow radin et al 2008 in this study the fluorescent images of the dead end channels were analysed the emulsification rates were determined using fick s law miller and raney 1993 by plotting the position of the emulsion phase front against time a diffusion coefficient d was calculated for each experiment by linear regression fig 10 2 x d d t where x d is the distance travelled by the interface over time t the x d values were determined by tracking the main emulsion red phase front in the dead end channels at different times t under the fluorescent light in late times the emulsification front was rather sharp fig 7 images 3 6 9 in early times where the emulsification front was diffuse the front was identified as the distance where 80 of the channel width was emulsion red the calculated d values were in order of 10 12 to 10 11 m2s 1 a simple calculation of stokes einstein diffusion gives d 10 11 for 20 nm particles suggesting the controlling diffusion was micellar diffusion steegmans et al 2009 at 1 nl min 1 injection the emulsification rates were lower probably at this rate the surfactant delivery into the dead end channel was not quick enough to keep up with a very active system at 100 nl min 1 injection the emulsification rate was significantly higher fig 10 suggesting that the surfactant delivery rate was more balanced with the emulsification rate in the context of this simple modelling study the diffusion processes should be distinguished from improved mixing due to convective processes the apparent increase in d should be interpreted in terms of the added convective mixing near the dead end pore junction to the main channel the convective flow probably helped to sweep the formed emulsion phase off the dead end channel and delivered fresh surfactant solution therefore the value of d was probably the lowest at the smallest injection rate 5 conclusions when designing surfactant solution formulations for enhanced oil recovery it is common to consult the equilibrium phase behaviour tests and identify the salinity at which the surfactant oil water system forms the most amount of microemulsion however these tests are performed at equilibrium conditions and during oil displacement the flow is coupled with the phase behaviour of the system we performed microfluidic flow experiments to investigate this coupling a fluorescent microscopy technique was used which enabled direct visualization of pore scale kinetics of emulsification and its effect on recovery of oil phase trapped in dead end channel where there was no convective flow image analysis on the dead end channels indicated that the marangoni effects contributed to emulsification process but the kinetics of emulsification could have been a rate limiting factor for the surfactant delivery consequently for the recovery of the oil phase observations regarding to mobilization of the trapped oil phase were the oil recovery was controlled by the emulsification characteristics of the surfactant oil water system the rate at which the surfactant was delivered and the geometry of the pore the rate at which the surfactant was supplied into the dead pore was dependent on the flow rate of the aqueous solution in the main channel at higher rates the surfactant delivery was more efficient captured images of emulsification in the dead end pores allowed for a qualitative analysis on evolution of the compositional gradients between the bulk phases in cases where the compositional gradient was high the two phase interface appeared sharp the interface was more diffuse when the gradient was low how far the dead end channel extended away from the main flow channel was important for pores with shallower extension it was probable to recover most of the trapped oil by water as the channel extended further away from the convective flow path the emulsification mechanisms could facilitate the oil recovery for very deep channels even though the emulsification occurred there was not enough driving force to produce the oil in clean or emulsified form acknowledgement authors would like to thank xuesong li for her assistance in the microfluidic chip design appendix a 1 oil phase in the micromodel air phase was easy to identify in the microfluidic chip fig a1 shows a snapshot from an experiment where over optimum surfactant solution was injected into n decane filled micromodel at 1 nl min 1flow rate some air was trapped in the dead end channel under normal light the air oil interface appeared thicker than the oil water interface fig a1a also the trapped air had slightly darker grey tone fig a1b shows the trapped air under fluorescent light under which the air phase does not emit any colour and was not easily distinguishable from aqueous phase a2 saturating the micromodel with n decane we tested two techniques to saturate the micromodels with n decane 1 oil was sucked in dry micromodels using a vacuum pump no isopropanol was used 2 by flushing with isopropanol and then n decane for 100s of pore volumes normally the flushing continues a few days at different flow rates each salinity system experiment was repeated at least twice in some cases we prepared them by the vacuum techniques and in some we used the flushing techniques upon injecting the same salinity surfactant solution in vacuumed or flushed micromodel we observed the similar microemulsion formation and oil displacement behavior therefore we concluded that the flushing the micromodels with excessive pore volumes of n decane was sufficient 
852,microemulsions have found applications as carriers for the transport of solutes through various porous media they are commonly pre prepared in bulk form and then injected into the medium the preparation is done by actively mixing the surfactant water and oil and then allowing the mixture to stagnate until equilibrium is reached the resulting microemulsion characteristics of the surfactant oil water system are studied at equilibrium conditions and perfect mixing is assumed but in applications like subsurface remediation and enhanced oil recovery microemulsion formation may occur in the pore space surfactant solutions are injected into the ground to solubilize and or mobilize the non aqueous phase liquids napls by in situ emulsification flow dynamics and emulsification kinetics are coupled which also contributes to in situ mixing in this study we investigated the nature of such coupling for a quasi miscible fluid system in a conductive channel with dead end extensions a microfluidic setup was used where an aqueous solution of an anionic internal olefin sulfonate 20 24 ios surfactant was injected into n decane saturated glass micromodel the oil phase was coloured using a solvatochromatic dye allowing for direct visualization of the aqueous and oil phases as well as their microemulsions under fluorescent light presence of both conductive and stagnant dead end channels in a single pore system made it possible to isolate different transport mechanisms from each other but also allowed to study the transitions from one to the other in the conductive channel the surfactant was carried with flow and emulsification was controlled by the localized flow dynamics in the stagnant zones the driving force of the mass transfer was driven by the chemical concentration gradient some of the equilibrium phase behaviour characteristics of the surfactant oil water system were recognisable during the quasi miscible displacement however the equilibrium tests alone were not sufficient to predict the emulsification process under dynamic conditions keywords diffusion phase behaviour compositional gradient concentration gradient interfacial phenomena surfactant delivery marangoni microfluidics fluorescent microscopy 1 introduction microemulsions are used in various applications as delivery agents due to their thermodynamically stable nature and their ability to generate ultra low interfacial tensions ift hoar and schulman 1943 ruckenstein and krishnan 1980 schulman et al 1963 shinoda and lindman 1987 lawrence and rees 2000 flanagan and singh 2006 in pharmaceutical applications certain intravenous drugs are prepared in microemulsion form before being administered into the body lawrence and rees 2000 food industry uses a similar approach where the microemulsion is pre prepared before consumption flanagan and singh 2006 the preparation involves mixing of water oil and surfactant emulsification process is facilitated by providing mechanical energy of some form such as slight shaking mixing or sonication groves 1978 jafari et al 2007 the microemulsion characteristics are determined before consumption based on the phase behavior of the surfactant oil water system under equilibrium conditions winsor 1954 healy and reed 1976 healy and reed 1977 microemulsions have nano to micrometer scale feature sizes which make them suitable also for geoscience applications miller 1988a baret et al 2009 in subsurface remediation harwell et al 1996 abriola et al 1993 agaoglu et al 2015 javanbakht et al 2017 and enhanced oil recovery processes aqueous solutions of surfactant are injected underground to dissolve and or mobilize the non aqueous phase initially in place healy and reed 1977 lake 1989 davies and jones 1968 chiou and shah 1981 in cases of ground water remediation the primary objective is to enhance the solubility of the oil i e winsor type i system abriola et al 1993 agaoglu et al 2015 javanbakht et al 2017 in a solubilization flood the aqueous concentration of the contaminant increases via micellar partitioning thereby reducing the number of pore volumes which is required to be pumped to extract the dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl however mobilization of the solubilized oil phase may not always be practical due to its high density optimal mobilization by winsor type iii microemulsions utilizes ultra low ift to significantly reduce the capillary forces trapping the dnapl and allow the non emulsified clean oil to be swept by the injected water in oil bearing reservoirs a large fraction of the oil remains in the reservoir following the waterflood lake 1989 davies and jones 1968 chiou and shah 1981 miller and raney 1993 tagavifar et al 2017 fletcher et al 2015 warren and calhoun 1955 furthermore up to 20 of this remaining oil saturation can be trapped in the dead end pores where there is no convective flow fatt 1961 in these situations the injected aqueous solutions of surfactant can create a nonequilibrium condition in the pore space high surfactant concentration in the highly conductive flowing channels and no surfactant in the non conductive ones de gennes 1983 lopez montilla et al 2002 battal et al 2003 miller 1988b solans et al 2016 equilibrium is eventually obtained by transfer of surfactant molecules from the bulk aqueous solution towards the oil water interface the ift decreases how low the ift will become depends on the phase behavior of the surfactant oil water system the salinity of the surfactant solution is one of the determining factors of which winsor type microemulsion will form at optimum salinity winsor iii microemulsions form with the lowest possible ultra low ift values the system can establish 1 10 2 mn m 1 winsor 1954 healy and reed 1976 healy and reed 1977 winsor type i microemulsion called the under optimum microemulsion forms at a lower salinity than the optimum salinity winsor type ii microemulsion forms at higher salinity than the optimum salinity is called the over optimum microemulsion the ift values generated by under and over optimum microemulsions are typically higher than the values occur in the presence of optimum salinity microemulsions however these values can still be ultra low the displacement can become quasi miscible highly over optimum microemulsions are not desirable in general as most of the surfactant partitions into the oil and very viscous emulsions can form which limit the oil recovery process efficiency lake 1989 unlike in the intravenous drugs and food products the subsurface applications require in situ formation of the microemulsion in absence of external stirring emulsification evolves through flow in the pore space where flow is stagnant and bulk liquid phases are not initially at equilibrium it is conceivable that certain dynamic processes such as diffusion thermal fluctuations or ultra low ift could lead to emulsification when the phases are brought in contact miller and raney 1993 detailed studies of spontaneous emulsification without externally applied shear clearly showed that shear can be internally created through marangoni stresses shahidzadeh et al 1999 in other words shear is always present either externally applied or internally created by the system itself due to the initially present compositional and associated ift gradients when ift is low enough marangoni stresses are sufficient to lead to breakup of interfaces and form emulsions spooner et al 2017 it is likely that this mechanism coupled with the flow field is relevant to the application of surfactants in subsurface applications lake 1989 chiou and shah 1981 tagavifar et al 2017 fletcher et al 2015 the oil recovery efficiency of a surfactant solution in porous media relies on the emulsification kinetics and the flow dynamics which ultimately raises the question how relevant the equilibrium phase behaviour studies are for the flow systems laboratory lake 1989 chiou and shah 1981 miller and raney 1993 tagavifar et al 2017 fletcher et al 2015 and field scale warren and calhoun 1955 studies of oil recovery by surfactant flooding have demonstrated that the micellar solubilization can be rate limited the oil solubilization rate was found to be dependent on the ift between the oil and the formation injection water as well as the injection water velocity which determines the rate of surfactant delivery therefore the injection conditions flow characteristics of the fluids and the topology of the pore space become important tagavifar et al 2017 fatt 1961 in order to address the question on how flow and emulsification kinetics are coupled we performed a microfluidic study using an aqueous solution of olefin sulfonate surfactant and n decane the pore space was etched in a glass chip and composed of a main flow channel with dead end extensions the surfactant solution was injected into the n decane saturated micromodel the quasi miscible flow mimicking the key characteristics of oleic phase mobilization in dead end pores was studied the oil phase was coloured with a fluorescent solvatochromatic dye which allowed for the visualization of aqueous and oil phases and their microemulsions under fluorescent light the resolution of the camera was not high enough for identification of marangoni effects on in situ shear generation and consequent emulsification berg 2009 edery et al 2018 however the resolution was sufficient to identify the different transport mechanisms in stagnant and conductive channels in this paper the emulsification term was used for microemulsion formation the term microemulsion was used to represent the emulsion phases irrespective of their composition and mechanism of formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 fluids a model fluid system that forms a microemulsion at ambient conditions was used the surfactant was anionic and was an internal olefin sulfonate ios with a distribution of 20 24 carbon atoms c20 24 barnes et al 2010 howe et al 2015 it is used in the eor applications and is produced by shell chemicals enordet o series the surfactant solutions were prepared by mixing the 4 surfactant 5 cosolvent 2 butanol sigma aldrich 99 0 purity and salt nacl in deionized di water nacl concentration varied for a salinity scan all concentrations were in weight percent w w the oil used in the experiments was n decane n c10 and was purchased from sigma aldrich usa 99 0 purity the surfactant and co solvent concentrations used in this study were higher than the typical values used in field applications however with high chemical concentrations the formation of microemulsion was quicker and higher in quantity which made the visualization and image analysis easier 2 2 equilibrium phase behaviour studies the phase behaviour of the current surfactant oil water system was analysed as a function of salinity at room temperature aqueous solutions of surfactant and co solvent were prepared the salinity of the solutions was varied by adding nacl the salinity varied between 1 6 and 2 0 nacl for each salinity a 15 ml vt test tube was prepared which consisted of 7 5 ml of surfactant solution and 7 5 ml of n decane mixing ratio of 1 1 the contents of the tubes were shaken vigorously and the tubes were left stagnate as the phases separated under the influence of gravity once equilibrated the microemulsion phase formed a middle layer that contained most of the surfactant and some water and oil the solubilisation was analysed by visually inspecting the test tubes under light the emulsion inversion point at which the phase behaviour changes between different winsor types was determined based on the hydrophilic lipophilic deviation hld theory salager et al 1979 salager et al 2004 in all salinity scan tubes a separate microemulsion phase was identified fig 1 a the optimum salinity where the winsor iii microemulsion formed was at 1 8 nacl concentration at which the surfactant had equal solubility in oil and aqueous phases approximately half of the microemulsion was below the middle line of the tube vw and the other half was above the middle line in the oil phase vo overall 40 of vt was microemulsion vme fig 1b salinity values below 1 8 were referred to as the under optimum and higher than the 1 8 were referred to as over optimum salinity for example the surfactant oil water system showed under optimum behaviour at 1 6 nacl concentration and over optimum behaviour at 2 0 nacl concentration the equilibration time for under optimum and optimum salinity tubes were similar within one hour the middle phases formed there were no visible changes in the composition of the tube content afterwards the over optimum salinity tubes took significantly longer the lower and the upper boundaries of the microemulsion layer could be identified after at least three hours or more the phase behaviour of the surfactant oil water system was further studied with different 2 butanol surfactant concentration ratios m broens 2015 as m increased microemulsion formation was quicker i e boundaries of the middle microemulsion layer became visible in the test tube however opacity of the middle microemulsion phase increased with reducing m for example m 2 5 system 5 2 butanol and 2 surfactant had emulsification times of 15 mins for optimum salinity m 1 25 5 2 butanol and 4 surfactant system had emulsification times of approximately 1 h for optimum salinity both m 2 5 and m 1 25 systems had transparent microemulsions at optimum salinity where m 1 0 625 2 5 2 butanol and 4 surfactant and in cases where the surfactant solution contained no 2 butanol the emulsification took significantly longer i e 1 day for optimum salinity furthermore the microemulsion was very opaque rather milky 2 3 interfacial tension measurements using a spinning drop tensiometer svt 20 dataphysics germany ift between the microemulsion and the aqueous layer was measured the sample holder of the tensiometer was a glass capillary with 5 mm inner diameter the capillary was open at one end to introduce the aliquot samples of equilibrated microemulsion and the aqueous phase bottom layer in each salinity tube was drawn using a syringe needle the glass capillary was first filled with the aqueous phase and then a drop of microemulsion was carefully placed in it the open end of the capillary was closed with a screw cap and the capillary was placed in the measuring chamber of the tensiometer the measurements were taken at different spin rates i e 1000 1500 2000 rpm until a steady reading was obtained at each rate using the camera of the set up photos of the microemulsion drop was taken and the ift value was determined based on the drop shape all ift values were ultra low i e below 1 10 2 mn m 1 fig 2 the ift between n decane and water no surfactant was significantly higher 43 mn m 1 10 20 measurements per system were taken at each spinning rate and none of the readings was excluded because they were too high low the noise in the ift measurements may be due to various reasons impurities in the chemicals is one of them the colour contrast between the microemulsion drop and the aqueous phase varied based on the salinity for the under optimum system the contrast was less therefore it was more difficult to obtain a stable reading this resulted in higher deviation in the readings for under optimum salinity values fig 2 1 6 and 1 7 nacl data points 2 4 viscosity measurements the microemulsion phase of each salinity tube was collected with a needle syringe the viscosity of the microemulsion was measured as a function of shear rate using a sinus ls300 couette principle rheometer prorheo germany the shear rates ranged between 1 and 100 s 1 the representative darcy scale shear rate was calculated using the canella equation for power law rheology teeuw and hesselink 1980 1 γ e q 3 n 1 n u 8 k ϕ where n is the power law index k is the permeability of the porous medium u is the darcy velocity and ϕ is the porosity of the porous medium the value of n indicates the degree of departure from newtonian behaviour the fluid is shear thinning for n 1 shear thickening for n 1 and newtonian for n 1 for a rock with permeability of 100 mdarcy and porosity of 0 20 a shear rate of 7 s 1 corresponds to a pore flow velocity of 1 ft day 1 this is a typical injection rate for an oil reservoir the microemulsion used in this study showed newtonian like behaviour and thus the value of n was set to 1 broens 2015 unsal et al 2016 the microemulsion viscosity was the lowest at optimum salinity the values increased as the salinity shifted from the optimum fig 3 shows the microemulsion viscosity values at 7 s 1 shear rate at room temperature at this temperature the viscosity of the bulk surfactant solution and n decane were 40 mpa s and 0 85 mpa s respectively 2 5 microfluidic experiments the pore geometry was etched in a glass microfluidic chip micronit the netherlands and composed of a main capillary channel with dead end extensions perpendicular to its axis fig 4 the main capillary was connected to a syringe pump harvard apparatus phd ultra uk at one end was open to the atmosphere at the other end the microfluidic chip was horizontally placed under the inverted fluorescence microscope leica dm6000 germany which could be operated with normal and fluorescent light the images were analysed using the leica qwin software leica germany experiments were performed at room temperature and it was assumed that there was no temperature gradient in the microfluidic chip the flow experiments started with oil saturated pore space saturation of the micromodel with oil was done in two stages first the micromodel was flushed with isopropanol which was more wetting than air it filled up the pore space including the dead end extensions then n decane was injected into the micromodel because isopropanol was soluble in n decane n decane eventually filled up the pore space the n decane was continuously injected in the micromodel for many pore volumes i e 100 s to ensure that the isopropanol was displaced completely the oil in the dead end extension was stagnant and represented the trapped oil once the micromodel was saturated with oil surfactant solution was injected emulsification took place as the injected surfactant solution encountered the oil the surfactant adsorption onto the glass surface was assumed negligible multiple channels were analysed in each micromodel experiment fig 4 channels 9 12 these channels were selected because they are in the centre of the micromodel away from the inlet and outlet of the micromodel to minimize the boundary condition effects 2 6 solvatochromatic fluorescent dye visualization of the microemulsion formation was viable by using a fluorescent solvatochromic dye named nile red cayman chemical company usa the cell based assay nile red solution was diluted with n decane 500 dilution by volume identification of oil and aqueous phases and their emulsions was possible under fluorescent light the oil and the microemulsion emitted amber and red colour respectively the aqueous phase did not emit any colour as no dye was solubilized in it it was confirmed that the dye did not affect the phase behaviour of the surfactant oil water system broens 2015 unsal et al 2016 2 7 photobleaching the fluorescence emitted is often observed to substantially decrease with time which is known as photobleaching in general the loss of fluorescence that comes along with photobleaching has the undesirable effect of reducing the signal to noise ratio and the quality of the collected images and data diaspro et al 2006 for example images which were taken at later stages of the same experiments emitted less fluorescence than the ones taken at earlier times this may have reflected on the image analysis findings nevertheless the experiments and the emulsification profiles of the same surfactant oil water systems were reproducible most of these observations on the fluorescent images of this study will be discussed on a qualitative basis they have been used to gain insights into the mobilization of the trapped oil phase by emulsification 3 experimental results 3 1 microfluidic experiments to mimic the oil mobilization by surfactant injection in a laboratory setting a series of flow experiments were performed table 1 lists the experiments which will be discussed in this paper results from under and over optimum salinity systems will be presented the optimum salinity 1 8 nacl system showed similar attributes to the under optimum system the images of the dead end pores were taken under fluorescent light and were further analysed the microemulsion saturation red area was plotted as a function of time to determine an emulsification rate for each salinity system two main assumptions here were that 1 dead end pores were not conductive to flow 2 mixing of two phases in a dead end was therefore not dominated by the macroscopic pressure gradient which drove the flow in the main channel the results will be discussed based on the observations made on one of the dead end extensions per experiment however we have analysed multiple channels fig 4 channels 9 12 in each micromodel experiment and the individual dead end channels followed the same trend 3 1 1 base case water injection in the base case experiment no surfactant was added in the injection water only di water was injected therefore the ift between n decane and water was relatively high 43 mn m 1 water was the wetting phase and it was injected into the coloured n decane saturated micromodel single frames from the experiment where the aqueous phase was injected at 10 nl min 1 are shown in fig 5 under fluorescent light the oil phase emitted amber colour the water phase was invisible black fig 5a the boundaries of the capillary channels are marked with dashed lines as the water invaded the main capillary it also began to imbibe into the dead end channel displacing oil no emulsification occurred due to absence of surfactant i e there were no red areas visible under fluorescent light the oil was expelled from the open face of the dead end pore in droplets oil production was counter current water imbibed in the dead end channel while the oil droplets moved in opposite direction towards the open face and into the main flow channel morrow and mason 2001 unsal et al 2009 the droplets were then carried away with the flow stream the oil droplet size range was 30 40 micrometer some drops merged into larger ones during the mobilization process the speed of drop generation was driven the rate at which the oil water meniscus advanced in the channel and this slowed with the distance that the interface had already travelled washburn effect unsal et al 2009 washburn 1921 this effect meant that successive drops were produced at ever slower rates after 12 hour injection nearly one third of the oil in the dead end channel was recovered by imbibing water because the channel had non circular cross section with corners a water film imbibed along the corners ahead of the main oil water interface fig 5b this suggested that there was water flow in the angular corners which resulted in continuous pressure gradient along the dead end channel upon continuing with the injection for 24 hours no additional oil was mobilized the oil water glass contact angle α was extracted from the images fig 5c the micromodel was water wet α was determined as 26 3 however it was not possible to confirm whether this value was for advancing or receding contact angle 3 1 2 surfactant solution injection additional microfluidic experiments were performed with surfactant solution as the injection fluid the experimental protocol was the same as in the base case the surfactant solution was injected in the oil saturated micromodel multiple experiments with under and over optimum salinity surfactant solution were performed to study the injection rate effect the surfactant solution was injected at 1 nl min 1 and 100 nl min 1 microemulsion formation and resulting phase distribution in the dead end pore was analysed under normal and fluorescent light fig 6 shows snapshots from experiment 2 where the under optimum surfactant solution was injected at 1 nl min 1 on the left fig 6a the multiple structures of different sizes are seen under normal light however it was not possible to identify different phases on the right fig 6b the light source was switched to fluorescent and phases became visible the amber area was the oil phase as the surfactant was carried to the dead end channel via the convective flow emulsification started orange and red patches the black round features were the surfactant solution which had not yet solubilized any oil it was ensured that there was no air trapped in the pore space see appendix the displaced oil either in clean amber or emulsified red form emerged from the dead end channel at point a this exit point was at the right bottom corner of the open face where the dead end connected to the main flow since the flow was from left to right in the main channel the fluid pressure was the highest on the left corner and decreased towards right corner consequently this corner was the easiest exit point for the displaced fluid note that in the main channel a stream of red emulsion phase was observed this amount was more than what was produced from a single dead end channel it was the emulsion phase produced from preceding dead end channels another observation was the presence of convective flow streams at the entrance of the dead end fig 6b the flow field slightly extended into the channel and generated mixing consequently instant emulsification it also helped to sweep clean and emulsified oil kambayi et al 2015 fig 7 shows sequential images of a dead end channels from three different experiments where surfactant solution was injected into the oil saturated micromodel top middle and bottom rows show snapshots from experiments 2 3 and 4 respectively the time between the individual images of the same experiments are marked on each image image 3 is from experiment 2 and was taken 2 5 hours after the snapshots given in fig 6 also images 1 2 of fig 7 this image shows more oil being solubilized as the emulsification advanced deeper into the channel furthermore at the very end of the dead end channel the angular corners were filled with red fluid it was likely that the surfactant solution travelled through the edges of the channel and already emulsified some oil images from experiment 3 can be seen in the 2nd row of fig 7 images 4 6 under optimum surfactant solution was injected at 100 nl min 1 after 9 minutes shown in image 5 some oil had already been swept away through the thin oil stream towards the right bottom corner the surfactant solution progressed further into the channel black front later a few detached red spots appeared ahead of the main emulsification front image 6 this suggested that the surfactant travelled via some diffusive processes similar to experiment 2 fig 7 image 3 the emulsification progressed through the dead end channel edges and reached the end of the channel ahead of the main emulsification front the main flow channel was filled mostly with red emulsion and some clean oil patches the oil phase carried in the main channel was believed to be the produced from the preceding dead end channels experiment 4 where the over optimum solution was injected at 100 nl min 1 is shown at the bottom row of fig 7 images 7 9 the emulsification pattern was different compared to the under optimum system at the same injection rate fig 7 2 nd row the emulsification started by formation of circular patches image 8 as it progressed the emulsification front became piston like image 9 at the end of the dead end channel a thick red film was also observed at the corners another observation in fig 7 was that the interface between the emulsion red and the oil phases amber appeared sharper in some images images 3 6 9 while it was more diffuse in others images 2 7 8 in fig 8 a and fig 8b close up images are provided for images 2 and 3 of fig 7 respectively to examine the oil emulsion interface in detail in general between two different phases there is a transition from one bulk phase to the other over a length scale associated with a compositional gradient the interface between the two bulk phases has an interfacial energy i e ift which is proportional to square of this compositional gradient cahn and hilliard 1958 anderson et al 1998 compositional variations between the bulk fluids in this study originated from variations in oil and water content and in chemical concentrations such as surfactant cosolvent and salt such variations were driven by the phase behaviour characteristics of the surfactant oil water system as well as the local flow dynamics from collected images of the dead end pores it was not possible to determine the exact compositions of the bulk phases or the ift values at the interfaces however the following discussion may explain some of the causality for qualitative differences in the observed interface characteristics in fig 8a the oil emulsion interface color transition from red to amber was not sharp point a this suggested that there was a low compositional gradient between the emulsion red and oil amber phases the surface energy i e ift was relatively low potentially ultra low in case of a composition close to optimum phase behaviour small droplets of emulsion phase with diffuse interface were also spotted fig 8b point c in fig 8b the oil emulsion interface color transition from red to amber appeared sharp point b following the compositional gradient argument it was likely that such gradient in this region was high resulting in higher ift values i e not ultra low the interface was also curved with an approximately constant curvature indicative of capillary dominated process which supported the argument of relatively high ift compared to fig 8a a sharp interface was also observed at the emulsion surfactant solution interface on both fig 8a point d e and 8b point f the black regions indicated the presence of excess surfactant solution which had not yet solubilized any oil the interface in fig 8b was rather flat and deformed through the influence of flow field suggesting that the ift was ultra low and the local capillary forces were negligible the reason for differences in compositional gradient at different regions in the same dead end channel could have been related to the rate at which the surfactant was delivered to each region the surfactant delivery rate was a function of the rate at which the surfactant solution was injected into the micromodel but also depended on the emulsification characteristics of the surfactant oil water system and the local flow dynamics in fig 8 the two images were taken in the same experiment fig 8b was 150 mins after than fig 8a the surfactant solution was injected at 1 nl min 1 at early times the emulsification front was relatively close to the open end where the fresh surfactant solution entered the dead end channel fig 8a δxd1 due to this proximity surfactant supply was initially abundant which allowed the emulsification front to propagate rapidly not allowing enough time for any equilibration this generated a wide zone of compositional change and a small compositional gradient in the emulsion phase consequently a very diffuse interface during the following 150 mins the emulsification front advanced further into the dead end channel and more oil was solubilized the emulsification rate slowed down for two reasons 1 the travel distance of the surfactant to the emulsification front increased fig 8b δxd2 2 surfactant had to pass through the existing emulsion phase and was partially consumed by it initially formed emulsion did not have an equilibrium composition and required more surfactant to evolve towards equilibrium this equilibration process resulted in more uniform composition in the emulsion phase and sharper interface larger compositional gradient between the emulsion and the oil phases it is also likely that there was a colour gradient over the sharp interface from red to green but the resolution of the camera was not sufficient to visualize it it is also important to mention the role of the counter current imbibition on the emulsification and surfactant delivery process the imbibition was continuous the surfactant solution imbibed in the dead end channel figure 8b on the left g while the produced phase emulsified non emulsified oil moved in opposite direction towards the open face figure 8b on the right h and into the main flow channel therefore in cases where an interface was visible it was not symmetrical left side was ahead of the right side fig 8b points b and f and it was also likely that the surfactant delivery was interfered by the flow in opposite directions 4 discussion 4 1 emulsification rate snapshots from the flow experiments taken under fluorescent light were analysed for an emulsification rate in the dead end channel the fractional area occupied by the red emulsion phase zones in the dead end channel was plotted against time fig 9 by the time the surfactant solution injection started and the first image of a dead end channel was taken for data analysis time zero some oil was already solubilized the linear regression fit was extended to project the start time of each experiment fig 9 dashed lines experiments 2 3 and 5 projections met approximately at the same point in time 400 s time 20 experiment 4 projection was approximately 100 s earlier than the others the observations were interpreted as follows under optimum profile deviated from the straight line at l nl min 1 particularly at earlier times fig 9 blue diamonds the deviation was less pronounced at 100 nl min 1 fig 9 green triangles the probable cause was that the surfactant supply to the dead end channel was not quick enough at the lower injection rate in other words emulsification was faster than the rate at which the surfactant was delivered into the dead end channel unlike the under optimum system at 1 nl min 1 the emulsification profile of the over optimum salinity fit the straight line better fig 9 red squares at over optimum salinity the surfactant had higher affinity to oil to form the microemulsion the surfactant molecules had to travel to the oil phase from the water phase in which they were initially solubilized this would take longer than formation of an under optimum microemulsion where the surfactant preferred to stay in the aqueous phase therefore supply rate of surfactant at 1 nl min 1 was probably more balanced with the delayed microemulsion formation rate at over optimum salinity the phase behaviour test also indicated that the over optimum surfactant oil water system reached equilibrium significantly slower than under optimum system section 2 2 at 100 nl min 1 the emulsification rates were higher than the ones at 1 nl min 1 at both salinity fig 9 see slopes of black circles and green triangles vs red squares and blue diamonds the linear fit was also better the overall linear fit suggested that there was a diffusion controlled mass transfer between the oil and the surfactant solution miller and raney 1993 ruschak and miller 1972 for both under and over optimum salinity solutions there were deviations from the straight line at very early times this was believed to be due to convective flow at the open face of the dead end channel the emulsion phase which formed at early times was swept away by the flow stream fig 7 images 5 6 8 as the emulsification advanced in the channel the emulsion phase was less impacted by the convective flow effect fig 7 images 3 and 9 the injection experiments were repeated with lower concentration system i e 0 5 surfactant the cosolvent concentration was kept the same i e 5 the emulsion volumes generated during the injection experiments were correlated with the volumes formed in the test tubes emulsion volume decreased with decreasing surfactant concentration broens 2015 even though the surfactant supply was compatible with the emulsification rate relatively small amount of emulsion formed therefore the fraction of the red zones was smaller than the experiment where the surfactant concentration was higher 4 2 diffusion rate when the phase mobilization is controlled by diffusive processes there are several parameters that control the diffusion rate among the parameters that must be considered when injecting a surfactant solution are the surfactant concentration nguyen et al 2007 wang et al 2009 the velocity of the injected solution wang et al 2009 and intermittent flow which delivers the surfactant to the oil water interface and sweeps the mobilized phase the rate of diffusion increases as the surfactant concentration gradient increases earlier studies showed that the mobilization of the trapped oleic phase was highly dependent on the concentration of the surfactant but was less influenced by the pore water velocity or the duration of the flow radin et al 2008 in this study the fluorescent images of the dead end channels were analysed the emulsification rates were determined using fick s law miller and raney 1993 by plotting the position of the emulsion phase front against time a diffusion coefficient d was calculated for each experiment by linear regression fig 10 2 x d d t where x d is the distance travelled by the interface over time t the x d values were determined by tracking the main emulsion red phase front in the dead end channels at different times t under the fluorescent light in late times the emulsification front was rather sharp fig 7 images 3 6 9 in early times where the emulsification front was diffuse the front was identified as the distance where 80 of the channel width was emulsion red the calculated d values were in order of 10 12 to 10 11 m2s 1 a simple calculation of stokes einstein diffusion gives d 10 11 for 20 nm particles suggesting the controlling diffusion was micellar diffusion steegmans et al 2009 at 1 nl min 1 injection the emulsification rates were lower probably at this rate the surfactant delivery into the dead end channel was not quick enough to keep up with a very active system at 100 nl min 1 injection the emulsification rate was significantly higher fig 10 suggesting that the surfactant delivery rate was more balanced with the emulsification rate in the context of this simple modelling study the diffusion processes should be distinguished from improved mixing due to convective processes the apparent increase in d should be interpreted in terms of the added convective mixing near the dead end pore junction to the main channel the convective flow probably helped to sweep the formed emulsion phase off the dead end channel and delivered fresh surfactant solution therefore the value of d was probably the lowest at the smallest injection rate 5 conclusions when designing surfactant solution formulations for enhanced oil recovery it is common to consult the equilibrium phase behaviour tests and identify the salinity at which the surfactant oil water system forms the most amount of microemulsion however these tests are performed at equilibrium conditions and during oil displacement the flow is coupled with the phase behaviour of the system we performed microfluidic flow experiments to investigate this coupling a fluorescent microscopy technique was used which enabled direct visualization of pore scale kinetics of emulsification and its effect on recovery of oil phase trapped in dead end channel where there was no convective flow image analysis on the dead end channels indicated that the marangoni effects contributed to emulsification process but the kinetics of emulsification could have been a rate limiting factor for the surfactant delivery consequently for the recovery of the oil phase observations regarding to mobilization of the trapped oil phase were the oil recovery was controlled by the emulsification characteristics of the surfactant oil water system the rate at which the surfactant was delivered and the geometry of the pore the rate at which the surfactant was supplied into the dead pore was dependent on the flow rate of the aqueous solution in the main channel at higher rates the surfactant delivery was more efficient captured images of emulsification in the dead end pores allowed for a qualitative analysis on evolution of the compositional gradients between the bulk phases in cases where the compositional gradient was high the two phase interface appeared sharp the interface was more diffuse when the gradient was low how far the dead end channel extended away from the main flow channel was important for pores with shallower extension it was probable to recover most of the trapped oil by water as the channel extended further away from the convective flow path the emulsification mechanisms could facilitate the oil recovery for very deep channels even though the emulsification occurred there was not enough driving force to produce the oil in clean or emulsified form acknowledgement authors would like to thank xuesong li for her assistance in the microfluidic chip design appendix a 1 oil phase in the micromodel air phase was easy to identify in the microfluidic chip fig a1 shows a snapshot from an experiment where over optimum surfactant solution was injected into n decane filled micromodel at 1 nl min 1flow rate some air was trapped in the dead end channel under normal light the air oil interface appeared thicker than the oil water interface fig a1a also the trapped air had slightly darker grey tone fig a1b shows the trapped air under fluorescent light under which the air phase does not emit any colour and was not easily distinguishable from aqueous phase a2 saturating the micromodel with n decane we tested two techniques to saturate the micromodels with n decane 1 oil was sucked in dry micromodels using a vacuum pump no isopropanol was used 2 by flushing with isopropanol and then n decane for 100s of pore volumes normally the flushing continues a few days at different flow rates each salinity system experiment was repeated at least twice in some cases we prepared them by the vacuum techniques and in some we used the flushing techniques upon injecting the same salinity surfactant solution in vacuumed or flushed micromodel we observed the similar microemulsion formation and oil displacement behavior therefore we concluded that the flushing the micromodels with excessive pore volumes of n decane was sufficient

water content reflectometer campbell scientific inc logan utah usa from three locations at gpg a single probe was installed under bare soil at 4 cm depth at sdg two probes were installed at 4 cm soil depth one under bare soil and the other under vegetation at gpk one probe was installed under bare soil at 3 cm depth the soil moisture probe can detect water content from 0 to 100 with m4 command with a high precision 0 05 and they were installed horizontally at the field sites fog data was obtained from fognet stations fig 1d which are part of the southern african science service centre from climate change and adaptive land management sasscal each fognet station comprised a cylindrical passive fog collector juvik fog collector coupled with regular rainfall gauge and screen mesh to measure fog amount every second due to the proximity of sdg and gpg approximate 3 5 km apart data from the same fog collector was used eighty rainless days august 19 2015 to november 6 2015 continuous volumetric soil moisture data and approximately two years december 1 2014 to november 1 2016 fog data were used for field data analysis and modeling purposes 2 3 analyses of field data to evaluate the effect of fog on soil moisture dynamics hourly soil moisture data and fog data were processed to daily scale central tendency and variability of fog and soil moisture were expressed as mean standard deviation s d and coefficient of variation cv to characterize the distribution of fog a graphic method was used by visually examining histograms of field fog data and a sequence of data generated by a non homogeneous poisson process rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 2 4 fog modeling a process based modeling framework was used to simulate soil moisture dynamics with fog as the sole water input variable the model was originally developed to understand how the stochastic rainfall influences soil moisture dynamics in drylands by expressing rainfall as a non homogeneous poisson process laio et al 2001 in this study the model was modified by replacing rainfall with fog water input and used a deterministic approach using field fog data to drive the model a simplified stochastic differential equation for bare soil water balance over the layer of depth zr is expressed as follows 1 n z r ds dt μ f e s t s l s where n is soil porosity zr is the active soil depth and was set to 0 34 m because it is the best fit of the simulation results within our isothermal framework in reality soil thermal properties including conductivity and diffusivity are strongly dependent on soil moisture whereby increase of soil moisture increases both note that thermal diffusivity decreases at high water contents aminzadeh and or 2013 analysis incorporating both soil moisture and temperature dynamics during nonisothermal processes requires further work s is relative soil moisture which is defined as the ratio between volumetric soil moisture and soil porosity n f is the amount of fog collected by fog collector e s and t s are moisture losses through evaporation and transpiration respectively l s is leakage via the bottom layer µ is a fog parameter that represents the percentage of fog absorbed by soil surface the fog factor is an empirical factor and was selected to best fit our simulation in reality the factor represents two processes firstly fog was collected from the fog collector above the soil surface and it is not always the amount of fog that is intercept by the soil secondly not all the intercepted fog could infiltrate into the soil e g soil texture and soil crust will have impact on fog infiltration which need another factor to characterize it our study basically merged these two processes into one parameter we also understand that soil evaporation is a complex process and evaporation e s in this modeling framework was simplified but the simplification should be sufficient for dryland ecosystems or et al 2013 t s was set to zero because the modeling was applied to a bare soil ground the modified model assumes that all fog water deposited on the soil surface is immediately transported into the soil infiltration and no leakage or surface runoff is generated i e l s 0 according to this modified framework the increase in soil moisture is due to fog infiltration the loss of soil moisture is only due to soil evaporation the loss function can be expressed as 2 e s 0 0 s s h e vap s s h s e s p s h s h s s e s p e vap s e s p s 1 where s is the relative soil moisture s h is soil moisture at the hygroscopic point s esp is soil moisture at evaporation stress point

to restrict evaporation and a positive relationship between soil moisture and evaporation is found for s sh no evaporation is generated in our study the estimation of parameters in eqs 1 and 2 are based on previous studies e g e vap s h and field measurements e g n laio et al 2001 porporato et al 2003 li et al 2016 the details of modeling parameters that were used in this study can be found in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 fog distribution in the recent stochastic soil moisture modeling framework rainfall was assumed to be a poisson process with a rate parameter λ and each event carried a random amount of rainfall α which follow an exponential distribution rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 porporato et al 2003 this is in coordinate with the occurrence of fog because the occurrence of each fog event is independent and each fog event carries a random amount of water this suggests that fog and rainfall potentially share a similar distribution we derived λ and α parameters using two year fog field observations from the gobabeb and kleinberg fognet stations table 2 a sequence of data was generated from a poisson process using the two derived parameters by plotting field observed fog data against derived data set at gobabeb and kleinberg the results showed that histograms between field observed fog and derived fog in these two locations generally showed a similar pattern suggesting that the two groups of data can be generated from the same theoretical distribution fig 2 a and b this suggests that we can characterize fog distribution using a poisson process unveiling fog statistical distribution particularly in arid regions is of great value for example fog waters in some drylands were reported to include a substantial amount of elements and were clean enough for human drinking and production purposes klemm et al 2012 eckardt and schemenauer 1998 a better understanding of fog statistical distribution may enhance the rationality of when and where to install the fog harvesting systems which could dramatically improve the efficiency of fog harvest vegetation patterns were also found to have close links with fog deposition because vegetation not only benefits from fog water moisture but also the various essential nutrients from fog water for growth beiderwieden et al 2005 templer et al 2015 by characterizing fog statistical distribution and incorporating this into ecohydrological models it becomes feasible to project changes in vegetation dynamics induced by fog pattern changes under the context of global climate change 3 2 field observations of fog and soil moisture dynamics table 2 shows fog parameters based on eighty day field observations august 19 2015 november 6 2015 recorded from the three locations total fog amount for gpk was 89 8 mm table 2 which was significantly higher than that of gpg and sdg 36 2 mm table 2 the frequency λ and average depth α of fog exhibited different patterns at these two sites with a larger average fog depth and more foggy days occurring at gpk the differences between fog total amount and fog parameters at gobabeb and kleinberg may be affected by the elevation topography and location e g distance to the ocean of fog gauges fig 3 shows soil moisture dynamics and its relationships with fog events at three study sites the mean soil moisture at gpg was 1 55 which is approximately three times higher than that at sdg 0 51 under bare soil 0 53 under vegetated soil respectively table 2 regardless of vegetation cover the cv at gpg was smaller than the cvs at sdg the cv under bare soil at sdg was the largest 19 6 table 2 which is nearly six times more than that of gpg the differences between mean soil moisture among three study sites might be explained by their differences in soil texture li et al 2016 soil moisture observations at sdg suggests that the mean soil moisture for vegetated soil 0 53 table 1 were slightly higher than that of bare soil 0 51 table 2 during the rainless period fog was observed to have moderate impacts on soil moisture dynamics with rising soil moisture corresponding to a series of fog events at gpg fig 3a considering no direct liquid water inputs e g from groundwater to the surface soil water and evaporation is the only source of soil water loss at gpg the water content dynamics in fig 3a supports the effect of fog in supplying soil water in dry regions at sdg the relationship between soil moisture and fog tended to be weaker though some soil moisture peaks matched with fog events fig 3b we also noticed that there was a clear rising trend both in the vegetated and bare patches fig 3b during the study period the rising trend was suspected due to water vapor transportation however we are not able to prove this proposed explanation at this moment due to a lack of robust evidence a clear discrepancy in soil moisture dynamics between sdg and gpg fig 3a and b existed under the same fog regimes the discrepancy might be due to the differences in soil texture since gravel plain has a stronger water hold capacity than sand dune when given the same water input at gpk no soil moisture dynamics fig 3c were observed to be related to fog occurrences which may be attributed to the presence of soil crusts on the soil surface at gpk they might act as an impermeable layer impeding water infiltration particularly preventing small amounts of water e g fog water vapor adsorption and dew to be absorbed by the soil surface kaseke et al 2012 in summary soil moisture dynamics was observed to have moderate correlation with fog events at gpg a weak relationship between fog and soil moisture were found at sdg and there was no relationship when moving further west to gpk during the rainless period during the course of wet periods e g during rainy reason no soil moisture and fog relationships were found at any of those three sites data not shown this is because the occurrences of rainfall events were mainly concentrated in the summer season even a small amount of rainfall may affect soil moisture dynamics for a long time and might mask the effect of fog on soil moisture dynamics our field observations filled the data gaps in concurrent fog and soil moisture observations in the namib desert and provided data support for studying vegetation and animal adaptions in the fog dependent systems in addition predictions in this already arid desert indicated that there would be less rainfall or larger rainfall variability in the future lu et al 2016 knowledge of the soil moisture fog relationship during the rainless periods suggested that stochastic modeling framework coupled with statistical fog distribution would be useful to make future soil moisture predictions 3 3 soil moisture modeling with fog as the sole water input soil moisture dynamics at gpg during rainless periods was selected and simulated by a modified stochastic modeling framework driven by field fog observations in order to fully take the advantages of the stochastic modeling besides modeling soil moisture dynamics using a deterministic mode i e using fog observations from the field as input to drive the model soil moisture dynamics at gpg were also simulated by using poisson process to generate fog input in general overall soil moisture patterns can be captured using this modified modeling framework fig 4 simulated mean relative soil moisture values using both deterministic and stochastic modeling were close to that observed in the field fig 4a and b most of the simulated soil moisture peaks and observed soil moisture peaks matched fig 4a and b comparing the soil moisture dynamics between using deterministic approach and stochastic approach fig 4c mean soil moisture was consistent and most of the soil moisture peaks agreed well between the two approaches all these findings implied the feasibility of the modified modeling framework for future projections such a modeling framework would be particularly useful for drylands such as the namib desert where rainfall is rare but fog is frequent although the overall soil moisture dynamics can be simulated some modeled moisture peaks did not match the field observations fig 4a the mismatch between field soil moisture peaks and simulated peaks may be affected by how the amount of fog is estimated fog is suspended water droplets and it forms only when the atmosphere water vapor reaches saturation wang et al 2017 at the field sites fog collectors are installed above the ground klemm et al 2012 because of this arrangement fog water collected by fog collectors is not necessarily the actual fog that deposited on the soil surface which might one of the reasons why there are mismatches between simulated soil moisture peaks and observed peaks in addition the infiltration mechanism of fog water is still poorly understood for example a heavy fog event does not indicate more fog infiltration to the soil profile and in turn a small fog event unnecessarily indicates less fog infiltration in addition moisture input into soil may start earlier as water vapor adsorption which the modified framework failed to take into consideration these three uncertainties may be responsible for the mismatch of soil moisture peaks moreover although soil moisture dynamics can be simulated using fog as a sole water input during rainless periods wet season soil moisture dynamics may not be fully revealed by the modeling framework which requires further improvements toward a better understanding of fog characterization fog infiltration and fog soil moisture relationships further work could be focusing on a better characterization of fog parameter μ which influences how much fog can infiltrate into the soil in addition the depth of fog infiltration would also be a valuable topic for further research other water resources e g dew water vapor adsorption in the namib desert could also be potential factors that can be incorporated into our fog modeling framework to fully understand soil moisture dynamics during the rainless period 4 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that fog can be well characterized by a non homogeneous poisson process with two parameters fog arrival rate and average depth our fog distribution investigation provided new insights and modeling support for future ecohydrological studies for example fog induced vegetation dynamics in drylands can be predicted by coupling ecohydrological models with fog parameters soil moisture and fog analyses from three field sites within the namib desert suggested that soil moisture dynamics were affected by fog occurrence at gpg while the relationship became less pronounced at sdg and there was no relationship at gpk the field results and analyses filled the concurrent fog and soil moisture observation data gap in the namib desert and shed light on using ecohydrological models to couple fog parameter with soil moisture dynamics informed by the field observations a stochastic modeling framework was used to simulate the impact of temporal distribution of fog on soil moisture dynamics the modeling results showed that most of soil moisture peaks and mean relative soil moisture were well captured by the modeling framework this suggests the feasibility of using this modified framework to predict future soil moisture changes under changing fog conditions however the fog impact on soil moisture during the rainy season cannot be captured due to residual effect of rainfall that may mask the impact of fog on soil moisture dynamics which might require future work acknowledgments we would like to acknowledge gobabeb research and training centre for access to the fognet weather stations and for the logistics support funding for this work was

atlantic ocean south east of walvis bay on the banks of the kuiseb river and at the edge of the namib sand sea kaseke et al 2017 fig 1 a and b the climate is hyper arid and the frequency of rainfall

water content reflectometer campbell scientific inc logan utah usa from three locations at gpg a single probe was installed under bare soil at 4 cm depth at sdg two probes were installed at 4 cm soil depth one under bare soil and the other under vegetation at gpk one probe was installed under bare soil at 3 cm depth the soil moisture probe can detect water content from 0 to 100 with m4 command with a high precision 0 05 and they were installed horizontally at the field sites fog data was obtained from fognet stations fig 1d which are part of the southern african science service centre from climate change and adaptive land management sasscal each fognet station comprised a cylindrical passive fog collector juvik fog collector coupled with regular rainfall gauge and screen mesh to measure fog amount every second due to the proximity of sdg and gpg approximate 3 5 km apart data from the same fog collector was used eighty rainless days august 19 2015 to november 6 2015 continuous volumetric soil moisture data and approximately two years december 1 2014 to november 1 2016 fog data were used for field data analysis and modeling purposes 2 3 analyses of field data to evaluate the effect of fog on soil moisture dynamics hourly soil moisture data and fog data were processed to daily scale central tendency and variability of fog and soil moisture were expressed as mean standard deviation s d and coefficient of variation cv to characterize the distribution of fog a graphic method was used by visually examining histograms of field fog data and a sequence of data generated by a non homogeneous poisson process rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 2 4 fog modeling a process based modeling framework was used to simulate soil moisture dynamics with fog as the sole water input variable the model was originally developed to understand how the stochastic rainfall influences soil moisture dynamics in drylands by expressing rainfall as a non homogeneous poisson process laio et al 2001 in this study the model was modified by replacing rainfall with fog water input and used a deterministic approach using field fog data to drive the model a simplified stochastic differential equation for bare soil water balance over the layer of depth zr is expressed as follows 1 n z r ds dt μ f e s t s l s where n is soil porosity zr is the active soil depth and was set to 0 34 m because it is the best fit of the simulation results within our isothermal framework in reality soil thermal properties including conductivity and diffusivity are strongly dependent on soil moisture whereby increase of soil moisture increases both note that thermal diffusivity decreases at high water contents aminzadeh and or 2013 analysis incorporating both soil moisture and temperature dynamics during nonisothermal processes requires further work s is relative soil moisture which is defined as the ratio between volumetric soil moisture and soil porosity n f is the amount of fog collected by fog collector e s and t s are moisture losses through evaporation and transpiration respectively l s is leakage via the bottom layer µ is a fog parameter that represents the percentage of fog absorbed by soil surface the fog factor is an empirical factor and was selected to best fit our simulation in reality the factor represents two processes firstly fog was collected from the fog collector above the soil surface and it is not always the amount of fog that is intercept by the soil secondly not all the intercepted fog could infiltrate into the soil e g soil texture and soil crust will have impact on fog infiltration which need another factor to characterize it our study basically merged these two processes into one parameter we also understand that soil evaporation is a complex process and evaporation e s in this modeling framework was simplified but the simplification should be sufficient for dryland ecosystems or et al 2013 t s was set to zero because the modeling was applied to a bare soil ground the modified model assumes that all fog water deposited on the soil surface is immediately transported into the soil infiltration and no leakage or surface runoff is generated i e l s 0 according to this modified framework the increase in soil moisture is due to fog infiltration the loss of soil moisture is only due to soil evaporation the loss function can be expressed as 2 e s 0 0 s s h e vap s s h s e s p s h s h s s e s p e vap s e s p s 1 where s is the relative soil moisture s h is soil moisture at the hygroscopic point s esp is soil moisture at evaporation stress point

to restrict evaporation and a positive relationship between soil moisture and evaporation is found for s sh no evaporation is generated in our study the estimation of parameters in eqs 1 and 2 are based on previous studies e g e vap s h and field measurements e g n laio et al 2001 porporato et al 2003 li et al 2016 the details of modeling parameters that were used in this study can be found in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 fog distribution in the recent stochastic soil moisture modeling framework rainfall was assumed to be a poisson process with a rate parameter λ and each event carried a random amount of rainfall α which follow an exponential distribution rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 porporato et al 2003 this is in coordinate with the occurrence of fog because the occurrence of each fog event is independent and each fog event carries a random amount of water this suggests that fog and rainfall potentially share a similar distribution we derived λ and α parameters using two year fog field observations from the gobabeb and kleinberg fognet stations table 2 a sequence of data was generated from a poisson process using the two derived parameters by plotting field observed fog data against derived data set at gobabeb and kleinberg the results showed that histograms between field observed fog and derived fog in these two locations generally showed a similar pattern suggesting that the two groups of data can be generated from the same theoretical distribution fig 2 a and b this suggests that we can characterize fog distribution using a poisson process unveiling fog statistical distribution particularly in arid regions is of great value for example fog waters in some drylands were reported to include a substantial amount of elements and were clean enough for human drinking and production purposes klemm et al 2012 eckardt and schemenauer 1998 a better understanding of fog statistical distribution may enhance the rationality of when and where to install the fog harvesting systems which could dramatically improve the efficiency of fog harvest vegetation patterns were also found to have close links with fog deposition because vegetation not only benefits from fog water moisture but also the various essential nutrients from fog water for growth beiderwieden et al 2005 templer et al 2015 by characterizing fog statistical distribution and incorporating this into ecohydrological models it becomes feasible to project changes in vegetation dynamics induced by fog pattern changes under the context of global climate change 3 2 field observations of fog and soil moisture dynamics table 2 shows fog parameters based on eighty day field observations august 19 2015 november 6 2015 recorded from the three locations total fog amount for gpk was 89 8 mm table 2 which was significantly higher than that of gpg and sdg 36 2 mm table 2 the frequency λ and average depth α of fog exhibited different patterns at these two sites with a larger average fog depth and more foggy days occurring at gpk the differences between fog total amount and fog parameters at gobabeb and kleinberg may be affected by the elevation topography and location e g distance to the ocean of fog gauges fig 3 shows soil moisture dynamics and its relationships with fog events at three study sites the mean soil moisture at gpg was 1 55 which is approximately three times higher than that at sdg 0 51 under bare soil 0 53 under vegetated soil respectively table 2 regardless of vegetation cover the cv at gpg was smaller than the cvs at sdg the cv under bare soil at sdg was the largest 19 6 table 2 which is nearly six times more than that of gpg the differences between mean soil moisture among three study sites might be explained by their differences in soil texture li et al 2016 soil moisture observations at sdg suggests that the mean soil moisture for vegetated soil 0 53 table 1 were slightly higher than that of bare soil 0 51 table 2 during the rainless period fog was observed to have moderate impacts on soil moisture dynamics with rising soil moisture corresponding to a series of fog events at gpg fig 3a considering no direct liquid water inputs e g from groundwater to the surface soil water and evaporation is the only source of soil water loss at gpg the water content dynamics in fig 3a supports the effect of fog in supplying soil water in dry regions at sdg the relationship between soil moisture and fog tended to be weaker though some soil moisture peaks matched with fog events fig 3b we also noticed that there was a clear rising trend both in the vegetated and bare patches fig 3b during the study period the rising trend was suspected due to water vapor transportation however we are not able to prove this proposed explanation at this moment due to a lack of robust evidence a clear discrepancy in soil moisture dynamics between sdg and gpg fig 3a and b existed under the same fog regimes the discrepancy might be due to the differences in soil texture since gravel plain has a stronger water hold capacity than sand dune when given the same water input at gpk no soil moisture dynamics fig 3c were observed to be related to fog occurrences which may be attributed to the presence of soil crusts on the soil surface at gpk they might act as an impermeable layer impeding water infiltration particularly preventing small amounts of water e g fog water vapor adsorption and dew to be absorbed by the soil surface kaseke et al 2012 in summary soil moisture dynamics was observed to have moderate correlation with fog events at gpg a weak relationship between fog and soil moisture were found at sdg and there was no relationship when moving further west to gpk during the rainless period during the course of wet periods e g during rainy reason no soil moisture and fog relationships were found at any of those three sites data not shown this is because the occurrences of rainfall events were mainly concentrated in the summer season even a small amount of rainfall may affect soil moisture dynamics for a long time and might mask the effect of fog on soil moisture dynamics our field observations filled the data gaps in concurrent fog and soil moisture observations in the namib desert and provided data support for studying vegetation and animal adaptions in the fog dependent systems in addition predictions in this already arid desert indicated that there would be less rainfall or larger rainfall variability in the future lu et al 2016 knowledge of the soil moisture fog relationship during the rainless periods suggested that stochastic modeling framework coupled with statistical fog distribution would be useful to make future soil moisture predictions 3 3 soil moisture modeling with fog as the sole water input soil moisture dynamics at gpg during rainless periods was selected and simulated by a modified stochastic modeling framework driven by field fog observations in order to fully take the advantages of the stochastic modeling besides modeling soil moisture dynamics using a deterministic mode i e using fog observations from the field as input to drive the model soil moisture dynamics at gpg were also simulated by using poisson process to generate fog input in general overall soil moisture patterns can be captured using this modified modeling framework fig 4 simulated mean relative soil moisture values using both deterministic and stochastic modeling were close to that observed in the field fig 4a and b most of the simulated soil moisture peaks and observed soil moisture peaks matched fig 4a and b comparing the soil moisture dynamics between using deterministic approach and stochastic approach fig 4c mean soil moisture was consistent and most of the soil moisture peaks agreed well between the two approaches all these findings implied the feasibility of the modified modeling framework for future projections such a modeling framework would be particularly useful for drylands such as the namib desert where rainfall is rare but fog is frequent although the overall soil moisture dynamics can be simulated some modeled moisture peaks did not match the field observations fig 4a the mismatch between field soil moisture peaks and simulated peaks may be affected by how the amount of fog is estimated fog is suspended water droplets and it forms only when the atmosphere water vapor reaches saturation wang et al 2017 at the field sites fog collectors are installed above the ground klemm et al 2012 because of this arrangement fog water collected by fog collectors is not necessarily the actual fog that deposited on the soil surface which might one of the reasons why there are mismatches between simulated soil moisture peaks and observed peaks in addition the infiltration mechanism of fog water is still poorly understood for example a heavy fog event does not indicate more fog infiltration to the soil profile and in turn a small fog event unnecessarily indicates less fog infiltration in addition moisture input into soil may start earlier as water vapor adsorption which the modified framework failed to take into consideration these three uncertainties may be responsible for the mismatch of soil moisture peaks moreover although soil moisture dynamics can be simulated using fog as a sole water input during rainless periods wet season soil moisture dynamics may not be fully revealed by the modeling framework which requires further improvements toward a better understanding of fog characterization fog infiltration and fog soil moisture relationships further work could be focusing on a better characterization of fog parameter μ which influences how much fog can infiltrate into the soil in addition the depth of fog infiltration would also be a valuable topic for further research other water resources e g dew water vapor adsorption in the namib desert could also be potential factors that can be incorporated into our fog modeling framework to fully understand soil moisture dynamics during the rainless period 4 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that fog can be well characterized by a non homogeneous poisson process with two parameters fog arrival rate and average depth our fog distribution investigation provided new insights and modeling support for future ecohydrological studies for example fog induced vegetation dynamics in drylands can be predicted by coupling ecohydrological models with fog parameters soil moisture and fog analyses from three field sites within the namib desert suggested that soil moisture dynamics were affected by fog occurrence at gpg while the relationship became less pronounced at sdg and there was no relationship at gpk the field results and analyses filled the concurrent fog and soil moisture observation data gap in the namib desert and shed light on using ecohydrological models to couple fog parameter with soil moisture dynamics informed by the field observations a stochastic modeling framework was used to simulate the impact of temporal distribution of fog on soil moisture dynamics the modeling results showed that most of soil moisture peaks and mean relative soil moisture were well captured by the modeling framework this suggests the feasibility of using this modified framework to predict future soil moisture changes under changing fog conditions however the fog impact on soil moisture during the rainy season cannot be captured due to residual effect of rainfall that may mask the impact of fog on soil moisture dynamics which might require future work acknowledgments we would like to acknowledge gobabeb research and training centre for access to the fognet weather stations and for the logistics support funding for this work was

854,while shear flow behavior through fractured media has been so far studied at single fracture scale a numerical analysis of the shear effect on the hydraulic response of 3d crossed fracture model is presented the analysis was based on a series of crossed fracture models in which the effects of fracture surface roughness and shear displacement were considered the rough fracture surfaces were generated using the modified successive random additions sra algorithm the shear displacement was applied on one fracture and at the same time another fracture shifted along with the upper and lower surfaces of the sheared fracture the simulation results reveal the development and variation of preferential flow paths through the model during the shear accompanied by the change of the flow rate ratios between two flow planes at the outlet boundary the average contact area accounts for approximately 5 27 of the fracture planes during shear but the actual calculated flow area is about 38 55 of the fracture planes which is much smaller than the noncontact area the equivalent permeability will either increase or decrease as shear displacement increases from 0 to 4 mm depending on the aperture distribution of intersection part between two fractures when the shear displacement continuously increases by up to 20 mm the equivalent permeability increases sharply first and then keeps increasing with a lower gradient the equivalent permeability of rough fractured model is about 26 80 of that calculated from the parallel plate model and the equivalent permeability in the direction perpendicular to shear direction is approximately 1 31 3 67 times larger than that in the direction parallel to shear direction these results can provide a fundamental understanding of fluid flow through crossed fracture model under shear keywords crossed fracture model roughness shear permeability 1 introduction fractured rock masses are naturally composed of solid rock material and various discontinuities such as faults bedding planes and joints pollard and segall 1987 olson 2003 cai et al 2010 torabi and berg 2011 liu et al 2018 due to the relatively high permeability and weak mechanical strength these discontinuities often dominate the hydro mechanical hm behavior of the host media understanding the coupled hm properties of fractures and changes in the flow field induced by shear is therefore of great importance in many engineering applications such as co2 sequestration mazumder et al 2006 enhanced oil recovery soudmand asli et al 2007 singh and cai 2018 construction of dam foundation chai and xu 2011 and risk assessment of radioactive waste disposal pollock 1986 zhao et al 2011 natural fractures usually display a strong hydraulic complexity coming from their internal rough topography brown 1987 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 lee and cho 2002 and from their arrangement in complex networks klimczak et al 2010 figueiredo et al 2016 luo et al 2016 huang et al 2017a 2017b the 3d fracture networks have the outstanding advances in describing the orientation connectivity and permeability tensor of real fractured rock masses lang et al 2014 cacas et al 1990 modeled the 3d fracture network as an idealized system made up of channels that join the centers of each fracture with an effective hydraulic permeability this sort of model mentioned as the pipe network was further developed by dershowitz and fidelibus 1999 for reasonable derivation of properties of these pipes erhel et al 2009 solved the fluid flow through 3d discrete fracture network dfn models in which fractures are explicitly characterized in terms of density length and orientation based on some stochastic methods dreuzy et al 2012 went one step further based on the numerical model developed by erhel et al 2009 to investigate the combined effects of fracture scale heterogeneity and the network scale topology on the flow properties they concluded that the upscaling from the single fracture scale to the fracture network scale modifies the effects of fracture roughness on the permeability although the flow properties through 3d fracture networks have been widely studied up to now there are still very few attempts to incorporate the shear effects the difficulty is mainly due to the quantitative description of the complex deformation mechanisms that are influenced by the intersections between individual fracture segments min et al 2004 li et al 2016 in order to improve the understanding of the shear flow behavior in fractured rock masses single fractures and single fracture intersections which are two fundamental elements involved in fracture networks should be thoroughly understood firstly watanabe et al 2009 li et al 2016 liu et al 2016 effects of shear on the permeability of single rough fracture have been widely investigated using the theoretical modeling laboratory experiments and numerical methods yeo et al 1998 conducted a number of radial and unidirectional flow experiments through single rough fractures they concluded that as the shear displacement increases the fracture apertures become heterogeneous and anisotropic the permeability in the direction perpendicular to the shear direction is larger than that in the direction parallel to the shear direction kim and inoue 2003 derived an analytical approximation of the permeability from the reynolds equation to investigate the anisotropy in permeability through rock fractures the obtained results can well explain those observed in laboratory tests and are consistent with the numerical shear flow experiments li et al 2008 carried out a series of coupled shear flow tests to evaluate the influence of morphological properties of rock fractures on their hydro mechanical behavior and proposed some empirical correlations to evaluate the effects of surface roughness and contact area on the behavior of flow through rough fractures rong et al 2016 experimentally investigated the nonlinear flow in rock fracture during shear under different hydraulic gradients results indicated that the critical reynolds number exhibits a decreasing variation with the shear contraction and consequently an increasing variation with the shear dilation of rock fracture for fluid flow through rough fracture networks the fluid will be redistributed at each fracture intersection due to the variances in fracture aperture and flow path park et al 2001 zafarani and detwiler 2013 kosakowski and berkowitz 1999 examined the variability of flow patterns in fracture intersections using a numerical simulation method and suggested that as the inertial force increases the classic cubic law is not applicable and the use of full navier stokes solution becomes necessary johnson et al 2006 performed the laboratory experiments of mixing between two miscible fluids through rough walled fracture intersection the results indicated that fracture roughness significantly enhances the physical mixing at the fracture intersection li et al 2016 analyzed the influences of hydraulic gradient surface roughness intersecting angle and scale effect on the nonlinear flow behavior and proposed a mathematical expression to estimate the hydraulic aperture of each fracture segment connected to the intersection these previous studies are mostly focused on the flow analysis in 2d fracture intersections where the hydro mechanical property in 3d fracture intersection under shear stress remains poorly understood the hydro mechanical coupling in fracture intersection is an important issue for many geoscience and geoengineering applications for example the major fractures in the rock masses are normally surrounded by damaged zones with a number of smaller fractures that are connected as shown in fig 1 a when the major fracture is suffered a shear displacement the aperture will be changed due to the normal stress induced closure and the shear stress induced dilation min et al 2004 this can lead to a great change in the permeability of the main fracture up to several orders of magnitude xiong et al 2011 and in the permeability of the surrounded fractures by a way of redistribution of flow at intersections the 3d crossed rock fracture model as shown in fig 1 b is viewed as a simplification of two intersected fractures extracted from the complicated fracture networks the objective of this study is to investigate the effects of fracture surface roughness and shear displacement on geometrical and hydraulic properties of 3d crossed rock fractures different rough fractures generated using the modified successive random additions sra algorithm were combined to form the crossed fracture model flow simulations were conducted under different shear displacements to calculate the corresponding flow field and the change in permeability of the model the flow redistribution at the intersection part and its influence on the flow rate ratio between two fractures were analyzed the influence of fracture surface roughness on the equivalent permeability and the shear induced permeability anisotropy were estimated 2 method 2 1 model generation fig 2 illustrates the shear progress on the 3d crossed fracture model at the initial state the two fracture planes plane 1 and plane 2 are intersected without any shift as shown in fig 2 a then the fracture plane 2 is supposed to be under a shear displacement of u 2 as shown in fig 2 b along with the movement of the upper and lower surfaces of fracture plane 2 the two parts of fracture plane 1 will be connected by the middle of the fracture plane 2 which is indicated as segment c as u 2 increases the permeability of fracture plane 1 may be changed depending on the roughness of the segment c and the applied normal stress the initial model is 128 50 80 mm in size and is under a maximum shear displacement of 20 mm which is the same magnitude as those reported in literatures esaki et al 1999 koyama et al 2006 since the nominal contact area between two fracture walls of fracture plane 2 decreases with the increment of shear displacement in order to maintain a constant analyzed area a smaller model with a size of 100 50 50 mm is extracted from the central part of the original model at each shear displacement as illustrated in fig 2 c 2 2 fracture surface generation natural rock fractures usually have rough walls with the surfaces typically following a self affine fractal distribution which can be modeled using the fractional brownian motion fbm several approaches such as successive random additions sra the randomization of the weierstrass mandelbrot function and the fourier transformation have been attempted to employ fbm to generate the fracture surfaces voss 1985 madadi and sahimi 2003 in this study the sra algorithm is adopted to simulate the surface heterogeneity for its efficiency and straightforwardness in the two dimensional fbm the aperture asperity height of a fracture wall can be represented as a continuous and single valued function z x y then the stationary increment z x lx y ly z x y over the distance lag l has a gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance σ2 molz et al 1997 ye et al 2015 the statistical self affine property of fbm increment can be expressed as 1 z x r l x y r l y z x y 0 2 σ 2 r r 2 h σ 2 1 where represents the mathematical expectation h is the roughness exponent or hurst exponent varying from 0 to 1 and related to the 3d fractal dimension d f by d f 3 h family and vicsek 1991 wang et al 2016 r is a constant and σ 2 is the variance defined as 3 σ 2 r z x r l x y r l y z x y 2 liu et al 2004 developed a modified sra algorithm to generate the 3d self affine surface of a fracture which overcomes the problems associated in the traditional sar algorithms that generally produce stochastic fractal distribution of poor correlation property a series of 3d self affine surfaces were generated using liu s algorithm with h equaling to 0 51 0 58 and 0 65 respectively the interval between the points in both the x and y axe directions is 0 125 mm as a total 800 points along the x axis direction and 400 points along the y axis direction are generated fig 3 displays three examples of fracture surfaces with different h and it shows that a smaller h results in more precipitous asperities and a rougher fracture surface and vice versa for each h different random numbers are used to generate different surface asperities then two of the rough fractures that have different surface roughness and suffer different shear displacements were selected to form the 3d crossed fracture model as shown in fig 1 c the joint roughness coefficient jrc for fracture profile proposed by barton and choubey 1977 is calculated using the following equation tse and cruden 1979 4 jrc 32 2 32 47 log z 2 where z 2 is the root mean square of the first derivative of the profile and can be expressed in the discrete form 5 z 2 1 n t z i 1 z i x i 1 x i 2 1 2 where x i and z i represent the coordinates of the fracture surface profile and n t is the number of sampling points along the length of a fracture the average of jrc values for a series of profiles along a surface in the direction parallel to shear direction is calculated which is the suggested method by the international society for rock mechanics and rock engineering isrm to calculate the jrc of a 3d single fracture isrm 1981 the spacing of 2d profiles is 1 mm as a total the jrc values of 50 2d profiles are calculated and their average value is regarded as the jrc of a 3d single fracture the calculated jrc equals to 6 12 and 18 corresponding to h 0 65 0 58 and 0 51 respectively 2 3 aperture assignment since the hydraulic responses of the fracture network depend on the aperture distribution within each fracture plane it is important to accurately model the variation of aperture during shear in this study the two walls of a fracture are assumed to be well mated at the initial state and the initial aperture equals to zero before the shear starts when the height of fracture surface generated using the modified sra method is described using the function z x y the fracture aperture b at the shear displacement u s can be calculated as 6 b x y z x u s y z x y u v i f z x u s y z x y u v 0 i f z x u s y z x y u v where u v is the normal displacement at u s indraratna et al 2015 proposed the following combined equations to calculate u v 7 u v 0 u s v d u s 8 v 0 for 0 u s u s peak c 0 v peak 1 1 c 0 1 2 u s u s peak 1 2 for c 0 u s u s peak 1 0 v peak exp c 1 u s u s peak 1 c 2 for u s u s peak 1 0 where ν is the dilation rate u s peak is the peak shear displacement c 0 is the ratio of u s u s peak at which dilation begins c 1 and c 2 are two decay constants and ν peak is peak dilation rate that can be calculated according to 9 v peak tan β 1 s n α sec 2 β λ where s n is the normal boundary stiffness α β and λ are parameters that can be determined using the following equations 10 α u s peak jrc π m ln 10 σ n 0 180 11 β 1 m jrc log 10 jcs σ n 0 12 λ k ni v m 2 k ni v m σ n 0 2 where jcs is the compressive strength of the joint surface k ni is the initial fracture normal stiffness at zero normal stress v m is the maximum closure of the fracture σn0 is the initial normal stress and m is the damage coefficient that equals to 1 or 2 depending on the magnitude of normal stress olsson and barton 2001 a small initial normal stress of 1 mpa as shown in table 1 is applied and an assumption is made that m 1 therefore asperity degradation or surface damage is not considered in the present primary study before the simulation of the shear on fracture plane 2 the aperture field of fracture plane 1 should be assigned the aperture fields calculated under the shear of fracture plane 1 with u 1 4 12 and 20 mm respectively are assigned to represent its different initial states here u 1 is the shear displacement of plane 1 for each u 1 u 2 4 8 12 16 and 20 mm are respectively considered the parameters used in the simulation are summarized in table 1 three different rough surfaces for fracture plane 1 jrc1 6 12 and 18 three different rough surfaces for fracture plane 2 jrc2 6 12 and 18 three initial states of fracture plane 1 u 1 4 12 and 20 mm and five shear displacements of fracture plane 2 u 2 4 8 12 16 and 20 mm are considered and in total 135 cases are simulated here jrc1 and jrc2 represent the surface roughness of planes 1 and 2 respectively 3 flow calculation since the rock matrix surrounding the fractures is assumed to be impermeable the flow only takes place in the fracture planes the description of fluid flow in a single fracture can be modeled using the reynolds equation with variable permeability that is closely related to apertures x y z are the coordinates in the 3d domain and x f y f f 1 and 2 are the local coordinates in the fracture plane 1 if f 1 and or fracture plane 2 if f 2 the governing equation in each fracture is written as johnson and johnson 1987 méheust and schmittbuhl 2000 2001 13 x f ρ g b 3 12 μ h x f y f ρ g b 3 12 μ h y f 0 where h is the hydraulic head μ is the dynamic viscosity ρ is the fluid density and g is the gravitational acceleration reynolds equation which is a simplified form of navier stokes equation has been widely utilized to study the linear flow through rough fractures brown 1987 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 vilarrasa et al 2011 dreuzy et al 2012 this is accomplished by dividing the void space within the fracture into a great number of small simplified parallel plates then geological roughness of the fracture can be incorporated into the model by assigning spatially variable values to b in eq 13 however in the present study the nonlinear flow of fluid is not considered due to the time consuming work of solving a set of coupled nonlinear partial derivatives of varying orders brush and thomson 2003 javadi et al 2014 in the 3d crossed rock fracture model the flow equation at each fracture is complemented with the continuity condition on the fracture intersections s k k 1 and 2 written as 14 h k f h k f 1 2 v k f n k f 0 where h k is the hydraulic head on intersection s k h k f is the trace of the hydraulic head on s k in fracture plane f v k f is the flow velocity through the intersection in fracture plane f and n k f is the normal unit vector on the boundary s k of fracture plane f the boundary conditions on the model are consisted of fixed hydraulic heads at the inlet and outlet faces as shown in fig 2 c and no flow occurs at the other four faces which can be summarized as 15 h h 1 on γ f γ in h h 2 on γ f γ out h n 0 on γ f γ imp where γf is the border of fracture f γin and γout are the inlet boundary and outlet boundary respectively γimp is the four impermeable faces n is the normal unit vector of the boundary h 1 is the hydraulic head applied on the inlet surface that equals to 10 mm and h 2 is the hydraulic head applied on the outlet face that equals to 0 as a result a constant hydraulic gradient of 0 1 is applied on the model the galerkin s method is used to solve eq 13 to simulate the flow processes in crossed fracture model during shear this method to solve flow through single fracture is classical but the continuity conditions should be well addressed prior to the solving of the flow the computation procedure is depicted in fig 4 after the generation of the geometrical model the next step is to define the mesh in order to guarantee the mass conservation in each fracture the mesh is required to be 2d in each fracture plane at the same time the discretization of the intersections is uniquely defined to apply the continuity conditions between the two intersecting fractures in this study the model is meshed using 160 000 small triangular elements applying the galerkin scheme to the eq 13 the discretized formulation of the equation becomes 16 m 1 n r m h m m 1 n f m with 17 r m s m b m t d m b m d s 18 f m l m n m t ρ g b 3 12 μ h x n x ρ g b 3 12 μ h y n y d l where n is the total number of elements m is the element number n x

continuity conditions in the intersections the discretized flow equation for the two crossed fractures can be expressed as the following matrix form 21 a 0 a 21 a 12 0 x n x i b n 0 where a 0 is the total stiffness matrix for each fracture plane a 12 and a 21 represent the continuity conditions x n is the hydraulic heads on all nodes x i is the local flux on the intersection nodes and it is an auxiliary variable and b n represents the boundary conditions a matlab program is developed to solve the above flow equations the flow velocity on each element is evaluated by differentiating the calculated hydraulic head and the flux q through the model is equal to the summation of the flow rate of each element on the outlet boundary then the equivalent permeability k of the model is back calculated using the following equation 22 q a k μ δ p l where a is the cross area of the inlet outlet face l is the length of the model and δp is the pressure difference between inlet and outlet boundaries 4 results and analysis in this section the effects of fracture surface roughness and shear displacement on geometrical and hydraulic properties of crossed rock fracture model were analyzed in which the roughness of two fracture planes the initial aperture distribution of fracture plane 1 and the shear displacement of fracture plane 2 were considered besides the systematic characterization of the connectivity and equivalent permeability of the model the overall flow response influenced by fracture intersection was analyzed 4 1 aperture distribution and flow channel the fracture aperture which is defined as the separation distance between the two facing topographies in the direction perpendicular to the mean plane of fracture is essential to estimate the hydraulic response of the crossed fracture model fig 5 shows the aperture frequency curves during shear for fractures with different jrc the value of b 0 represents the contact points between the upper and lower fractures and the contact area decreases with the increment of shear displacement for all samples as shear displacement increases the aperture frequency curves change from sharp to flat and the aperture corresponding to the maximum frequency when aperture is larger than 0 moves rightward comparison between the aperture frequency curves of three surfaces with different jrcs under the same shear displacement indicates a similar tendency this indicates that both the increments of shear displacement and fracture roughness result in the increment of the mean fracture aperture this tendency has been observed in many shear analyses of single rough fractures power and durham 1997 koyama et al 2006 xiong et al 2011 an example of the aperture distribution of the crossed fracture model under different u 2 and different jrc2 is shown in fig 6 in which the state of fracture plane 1 is fixed with jrc1 12 and u 1 12 mm the results show that when u 2 u 1 and jrc2 jrc1 i e fig 6 a the void space of fracture plane 1 is more complex than that of fracture plane 2 whereas when u 2 u 1 and jrc2 jrc1 i e fig 6 i the void space of fracture plane 2 is more complex than that of fracture plane 1 the previous investigations have shown that the fluids in single rough fractures tend to select a path through a few high transmissivity areas flow channels as a result the flow pathlines become very tortuous this phenomenon is channeling effect that arises from the heterogeneous aperture distributions tsang and tsang 1987 watanabe et al 2009 dreuzy et al 2012 maillot et al 2016 in order to examine the channeling flow effect in the 3d crossed fracture model the main flow paths in the models with the aperture distributions shown in fig 6 are calculated the results are displayed in fig 7 in which the preferential flow paths consist of the elements with the ratios of local flow rate to the total flow rate larger than 0 005 for a smaller u 2 the contact area of fracture plane 2 is larger indicating that most of the fracture segments are contacted or have a negligibly small aperture as u 2 increases some larger void spaces start to appear in fracture plane 2 and gradually converge into a few main channels this phenomenon is more obvious for a larger jrc with a dramatic decrease of contact area the distribution of aperture in fracture plane 1 is not changed in the shear progress of fracture plane 2 however the flow pattern through the whole model changes greatly with the increasing of u 2 and jrc2 for the model with u 2 4 mm and jrc2 6 fluids mainly flow through the fracture plane 1 as u 2 increases for example for the model with u 2 20 mm and jrc2 6 fluid flow at the entrance changes from being concentrated in the fracture plane 1 to the fracture plane 2 but the flow at the exit is still mainly occupied by the fracture plane 1 as the jrc2 increases for the model with u 2 4 mm and jrc2 18 both the two fractures contribute to fluid flow into the model when u 2 increases to 20 mm and jrc2 increases to 18 the fracture plane 2 dominates the fluid flow out of the model while the contribution of fracture plane 1 to fluid flow can be negligible the preferential flow paths exist in the noncontact regions of aperture distribution and are gradually changed mainly due to two reasons the apertures of fracture plane 2 are increased with the increasing u 2 and jrc2 and the segment c alters the flow redistribution between fracture plane 1 and fracture plane 2 these numerical results provide important information regarding the diversity of flow patterns during the shear of 3d crossed fracture model as shown in fig 8 the average contact area accounts for approximately 5 27 of the fracture planes depending on different u 1 and u 2 therefore the remaining noncontact area of about 73 95 of the fracture planes may be the channels in which fluid flows however due to the non uniform aperture distributions the fluid flows along with some least resistant flow paths as a result the actual calculated flow area is about 38 55 of the fracture planes which is smaller than the noncontact area ratio the residual area of about 35 40 of the fracture planes is the stagnant area when u 1 increases from 4 mm to 20 mm the contact area ratio decreases about 10 46 and the flow area ratio increases about 7 78 of the fracture planes when u 2 increases from 4 mm to 20 mm the contact area ratio decreases about 11 09 and the flow area ratio increases about 7 79 of the fracture planes both the variations are more obvious at a smaller shear displacement 4 2 redistribution of fluid flow during shear in order to quantify the flow variation through the model during shear the comparisons of flow rate ratios between two flow fracture planes at the outlet boundary are shown in fig 9 each case corresponds to an initial state of fracture plane 1 with different u 1 and jrc1 the value close to 1 0 indicates a dominated flow plane while the value close to 0 0 indicates on the contrary that the fracture contributes negligibly to the total flow for all cases the results of fracture plane 1 and fracture plane 2 with the same jrc2 are symmetric along with the dished line of 0 5 as u 2 increases the flow rate ratio of fracture plane 1 decreases and the flow rate ratio of fracture plane 2 increases when the flow rate ratio of fracture plane 1 is smaller than 0 5 at u 2 4 mm i e fig 9 a the two datasets will directly diverge from each other if the flow rate ratio of fracture plane 1 is larger than 0 5 at u 2 4 mm i e fig 9 i with the increasing u 2 the flow rate ratios of the two fracture planes will be closer to each other and then approach to 0 5 indicating that the fracture plane 2 plays an increasingly important role at a larger u 2 generally when the parameters of fracture plane 1 i e jrc1 and u 1 are close to those of fracture plane 2 i e jrc2 and u 2 the flow rates through the two fracture planes tend to be equal when the flow rate ratios of the two fracture planes equal to 0 5 the corresponding shear displacement of fracture plane 2 is denoted as u 2e the correlation between u 1 u 2e and jrc1 jrc2 is displayed in fig 10 generally u 1 u 2e decreases with the increment of jrc1 jrc2 following a power function that has a negative exponent when jrc1 jrc2 1 the u 1 is slightly larger than u 2e there are potentially two reasons 1 the aperture distributions of the two fracture planes having the same jrc are randomly assigned and 2 the segment c tends to decrease the connectivity between the two parts of fracture plane 1 compared with its original shear induced flow connectivity in order to analyze the influence of segment c on the permeability of fracture plane 1 the flow rate q 1 of fracture plane 1 at the outlet boundary of the model with parameters of jrc1 jrc2 u 1 and u 2 is compared with the flow rate q 0 of fracture plane 1 calculated from the model with same parameters while fracture plane 2 is not sheared then the variation of q 1 q 0 with respect to jrc1 jrc2 and u 1 u 2 is calculated and illustrated in fig 11 when jrc1 jrc2 1 and u 1 u 2 1 q 1 q 0 is generally larger than 1 because the shear induced segment c by fracture plane 2 is more permeable than that of fracture plane 1 when jrc1 jrc2 1 and u 1 u 2 1 the shear induced segment c by fracture plane 2 is less permeable and will break the original flow channels in fracture plane 1 as a result q 1 q 0 is smaller than 1 for other cases with jrc1 jrc2 1 and u 1 u 2 1 or jrc1 jrc2 1 and u 1 u 2 1 the influences of jrc1 jrc2 and u 1 u 2 are competitive jrc1 jrc2 1 tends to decrease the permeability while u 1 u 2 1 tends to enhance the permeability by allowing the fluid to flow through the more permeable segment c and vice versa in such cases the value of q 1 q 0 will dispersedly distribute around 1 4 3 permeability 4 3 1 evolution of permeability during shear the evolutions of k of the crossed fracture model with respect to u 2 are illustrated in fig 12 when u 2 increases from 0 to 4 mm the variation of k depends on the influences of segment c on the conductivity of fracture plane 1 and the mean aperture increment of fracture plane 2 for example when jrc1 6 and u 1 4 mm k increases as u 2 increases from 0 to 4 mm for all models with different jrc2 this is mainly because that when u 2 increases to 4 mm the permeability of fracture plane 2 increases however since u 2 u 1 the shear induced segment c by fracture plane 2 would decrease the permeability of fracture plane 1 therefore when jrc1 and u 1 are small i e jrc1 6 and u 1 4 mm the permeability increment of fracture plane 2 is larger than the permeability decrement of fracture plane 1 as a result the k of the crossed fracture model increases as shown in fig 12 a on the contrary when jrc1 18 and u 1 20 mm k decreases as u 2 increases from 0 to 4 mm for all models with different jrc2 this is because that u 2 is much smaller than u 1 the permeability of fracture plane 2 would increase slightly compared with the original permeability of fracture plane 1 however the shear induced segment c by fracture plane 2 would significantly decrease the permeability of fracture plane 1 therefore an overall decrement of k of the crossed fracture model is obtained as shown in fig 12 i for all cases as u 2 continuously increases by up to 20 mm the increment of permeability of fracture plane 2 plays a more dominate role consequently k increases but the increasing rate decreases comparisons among the k of the cases with different jrc2 show that k increases slightly as u 1 increases both jrc1 and jrc2 have significant influences on k and k increases with the increment of fracture surface roughness when the shear displacement is fixed 4 3 2 effect of fracture roughness on permeability fluid flow in rock fractures is commonly simulated using parallel plate model in the early studies which is a simplification of the real rough rock fractures tsang and witherspoon 1981 schrauf and evans 1986 other previous studies have shown that the fluid flow through single rough fracture is heavily channelized and the flow rate predicted using the rough fracture models is approximately 70 90 of that predicted using the parallel plate models brown 1987 to study this issue for the crossed fracture model the internally heterogeneous fractures in the crossed model are replaced by two parallel plates in which the aperture of each parallel plate model is equal to the mean mechanical aperture of the corresponding rough fracture the comparisons of the equivalent permeability predicted using the rough crossed fracture model and equivalent parallel crossed plate model are shown in fig 13 where the surface roughness and initial state of fracture plane 1 are fixed as jrc1 6 and u 1 4 mm results show that despite of jrc2 the k predicted using the rough model is approximately 26 80 of that of the parallel model because in the rough model the channeling effect is robust and most of the void spaces between the two fracture walls do not or negligibly contribute to fluid flow however in the parallel model these noncontact regions have been assigned a uniform aperture that significantly devotes to fluid flow another potential reason is that the aperture is simplified from the heterogenous distribution in the rough fracture model to the uniform distribution in the parallel plate model in the cubic law the flow rate is linearly proportional to the cube of aperture and such a simplification would vary the permeability therefore to realistically simulate the fluid flow and or solute transport in rock fractures the rough crossed fracture model should be utilized and the channeling flow should be considered 4 3 3 shear induced anisotropy of permeability the permeability anisotropy of single rough fractures during shear has been extensively investigated in previous studies lee and cho 2002 auradou et al 2005 koyama et al 2006 2008 matsuki et al 2010 generally the permeability in the direction perpendicular to fluid flow is several times larger than that in the direction parallel to fluid flow in this section we would estimate the permeability anisotropy of rough crossed fracture model during shear the comparisons of equivalent permeability in x direction k x and in y direction k y is shown in fig 14 a by fixing jrc1 6 and u 1 4 mm here the x direction is the flow direction and the y direction is the direction perpendicular to fluid flow as shown in fig 2 c results show that with the increment of u 2 both k x and k y increase but the increasing rate decreases gradually to quantify the anisotropy the variation of ky kx versus u 2 is plotted in fig 14 b with jrc2 increasing from 6 to 18 the ky kx ranges from 1 31 to 3 67 which shows a similar range with the results of koyama et al 2006 2008 and huang et al 2017b as tabulated in table 2 this indicates that the permeability anisotropy of crossed fractures is similar with that of single fractures 5 conclusions this study established a series of 3d crossed fracture models to study the combined effects of fracture surface roughness and shear displacement on the geometrical and hydraulic properties different combinations of surface roughness of the two fractures in the model were considered in which the fracture surfaces were generated using the modified successive random additions sra algorithm shear displacement was applied on the one fracture by fixing the aperture and surface roughness of another fracture fluid flow through the model was simulated and the evolutions of aperture flow channel equivalent permeability and the flow rate ratio between two fractures were estimated by comparing the equivalent permeability of rough crossed fracture model with respect to the equivalent permeability of the corresponding parallel crossed fracture model the influences of fracture roughness on the permeability were analyzed the changes of permeability in directions perpendicular and parallel to shear direction were quantified to illustrate the shear induced permeability anisotropy in crossed fracture model the results show that during the shear the average contact area accounts for approximately 5 27 of the fracture planes and the actual calculated flow area is about 38 55 of the fracture planes which is smaller than the noncontact area as the fracture surface roughness and or shear displacement changes the main flow paths through the model may change from mainly existing in one fracture to another fracture which reveals the diversity of flow patterns during the shear of 3d crossed fracture network model the flow rate ratios between two fractures at the outlet boundary change as shear displacement increases accompanied with the redistribution of flow at the intersection part between two fractures the equivalent permeability of model will either increase or decrease as shear displacement increases from 0 to 4 mm depending on the aperture distribution of intersection part between two fractures when shear displacement continuously increases by up to 20 mm the equivalent permeability increases sharply first and then keeps increasing with a lower gradient the equivalent permeability of rough fractured model is about 26 80 of that calculated from the parallel plate model which indicates the channelized flow path inside the fracture reduces its permeability the equivalent permeability in the direction perpendicular to shear direction is approximately 1 31 3 67 times larger than that in the direction parallel to shear direction which is similar with the phenomenon in single fractures although these numerical results provide findings of significant interest in the future a thorough investigation should be conducted because of the limitation of the fracture size intersection angle and shear model considered in this study in the present model the influence of the anisotropic mechanical load on the fracture plane 1 is not considered which is potentially correlated to the intersection angle in the future study we plan to extend our investigation to more realistic models to examine the flow behaviors of simple fracture networks under shear stress acknowledgments this study has been partially funded by national natural science foundation of china china

854,while shear flow behavior through fractured media has been so far studied at single fracture scale a numerical analysis of the shear effect on the hydraulic response of 3d crossed fracture model is presented the analysis was based on a series of crossed fracture models in which the effects of fracture surface roughness and shear displacement were considered the rough fracture surfaces were generated using the modified successive random additions sra algorithm the shear displacement was applied on one fracture and at the same time another fracture shifted along with the upper and lower surfaces of the sheared fracture the simulation results reveal the development and variation of preferential flow paths through the model during the shear accompanied by the change of the flow rate ratios between two flow planes at the outlet boundary the average contact area accounts for approximately 5 27 of the fracture planes during shear but the actual calculated flow area is about 38 55 of the fracture planes which is much smaller than the noncontact area the equivalent permeability will either increase or decrease as shear displacement increases from 0 to 4 mm depending on the aperture distribution of intersection part between two fractures when the shear displacement continuously increases by up to 20 mm the equivalent permeability increases sharply first and then keeps increasing with a lower gradient the equivalent permeability of rough fractured model is about 26 80 of that calculated from the parallel plate model and the equivalent permeability in the direction perpendicular to shear direction is approximately 1 31 3 67 times larger than that in the direction parallel to shear direction these results can provide a fundamental understanding of fluid flow through crossed fracture model under shear keywords crossed fracture model roughness shear permeability 1 introduction fractured rock masses are naturally composed of solid rock material and various discontinuities such as faults bedding planes and joints pollard and segall 1987 olson 2003 cai et al 2010 torabi and berg 2011 liu et al 2018 due to the relatively high permeability and weak mechanical strength these discontinuities often dominate the hydro mechanical hm behavior of the host media understanding the coupled hm properties of fractures and changes in the flow field induced by shear is therefore of great importance in many engineering applications such as co2 sequestration mazumder et al 2006 enhanced oil recovery soudmand asli et al 2007 singh and cai 2018 construction of dam foundation chai and xu 2011 and risk assessment of radioactive waste disposal pollock 1986 zhao et al 2011 natural fractures usually display a strong hydraulic complexity coming from their internal rough topography brown 1987 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 lee and cho 2002 and from their arrangement in complex networks klimczak et al 2010 figueiredo et al 2016 luo et al 2016 huang et al 2017a 2017b the 3d fracture networks have the outstanding advances in describing the orientation connectivity and permeability tensor of real fractured rock masses lang et al 2014 cacas et al 1990 modeled the 3d fracture network as an idealized system made up of channels that join the centers of each fracture with an effective hydraulic permeability this sort of model mentioned as the pipe network was further developed by dershowitz and fidelibus 1999 for reasonable derivation of properties of these pipes erhel et al 2009 solved the fluid flow through 3d discrete fracture network dfn models in which fractures are explicitly characterized in terms of density length and orientation based on some stochastic methods dreuzy et al 2012 went one step further based on the numerical model developed by erhel et al 2009 to investigate the combined effects of fracture scale heterogeneity and the network scale topology on the flow properties they concluded that the upscaling from the single fracture scale to the fracture network scale modifies the effects of fracture roughness on the permeability although the flow properties through 3d fracture networks have been widely studied up to now there are still very few attempts to incorporate the shear effects the difficulty is mainly due to the quantitative description of the complex deformation mechanisms that are influenced by the intersections between individual fracture segments min et al 2004 li et al 2016 in order to improve the understanding of the shear flow behavior in fractured rock masses single fractures and single fracture intersections which are two fundamental elements involved in fracture networks should be thoroughly understood firstly watanabe et al 2009 li et al 2016 liu et al 2016 effects of shear on the permeability of single rough fracture have been widely investigated using the theoretical modeling laboratory experiments and numerical methods yeo et al 1998 conducted a number of radial and unidirectional flow experiments through single rough fractures they concluded that as the shear displacement increases the fracture apertures become heterogeneous and anisotropic the permeability in the direction perpendicular to the shear direction is larger than that in the direction parallel to the shear direction kim and inoue 2003 derived an analytical approximation of the permeability from the reynolds equation to investigate the anisotropy in permeability through rock fractures the obtained results can well explain those observed in laboratory tests and are consistent with the numerical shear flow experiments li et al 2008 carried out a series of coupled shear flow tests to evaluate the influence of morphological properties of rock fractures on their hydro mechanical behavior and proposed some empirical correlations to evaluate the effects of surface roughness and contact area on the behavior of flow through rough fractures rong et al 2016 experimentally investigated the nonlinear flow in rock fracture during shear under different hydraulic gradients results indicated that the critical reynolds number exhibits a decreasing variation with the shear contraction and consequently an increasing variation with the shear dilation of rock fracture for fluid flow through rough fracture networks the fluid will be redistributed at each fracture intersection due to the variances in fracture aperture and flow path park et al 2001 zafarani and detwiler 2013 kosakowski and berkowitz 1999 examined the variability of flow patterns in fracture intersections using a numerical simulation method and suggested that as the inertial force increases the classic cubic law is not applicable and the use of full navier stokes solution becomes necessary johnson et al 2006 performed the laboratory experiments of mixing between two miscible fluids through rough walled fracture intersection the results indicated that fracture roughness significantly enhances the physical mixing at the fracture intersection li et al 2016 analyzed the influences of hydraulic gradient surface roughness intersecting angle and scale effect on the nonlinear flow behavior and proposed a mathematical expression to estimate the hydraulic aperture of each fracture segment connected to the intersection these previous studies are mostly focused on the flow analysis in 2d fracture intersections where the hydro mechanical property in 3d fracture intersection under shear stress remains poorly understood the hydro mechanical coupling in fracture intersection is an important issue for many geoscience and geoengineering applications for example the major fractures in the rock masses are normally surrounded by damaged zones with a number of smaller fractures that are connected as shown in fig 1 a when the major fracture is suffered a shear displacement the aperture will be changed due to the normal stress induced closure and the shear stress induced dilation min et al 2004 this can lead to a great change in the permeability of the main fracture up to several orders of magnitude xiong et al 2011 and in the permeability of the surrounded fractures by a way of redistribution of flow at intersections the 3d crossed rock fracture model as shown in fig 1 b is viewed as a simplification of two intersected fractures extracted from the complicated fracture networks the objective of this study is to investigate the effects of fracture surface roughness and shear displacement on geometrical and hydraulic properties of 3d crossed rock fractures different rough fractures generated using the modified successive random additions sra algorithm were combined to form the crossed fracture model flow simulations were conducted under different shear displacements to calculate the corresponding flow field and the change in permeability of the model the flow redistribution at the intersection part and its influence on the flow rate ratio between two fractures were analyzed the influence of fracture surface roughness on the equivalent permeability and the shear induced permeability anisotropy were estimated 2 method 2 1 model generation fig 2 illustrates the shear progress on the 3d crossed fracture model at the initial state the two fracture planes plane 1 and plane 2 are intersected without any shift as shown in fig 2 a then the fracture plane 2 is supposed to be under a shear displacement of u 2 as shown in fig 2 b along with the movement of the upper and lower surfaces of fracture plane 2 the two parts of fracture plane 1 will be connected by the middle of the fracture plane 2 which is indicated as segment c as u 2 increases the permeability of fracture plane 1 may be changed depending on the roughness of the segment c and the applied normal stress the initial model is 128 50 80 mm in size and is under a maximum shear displacement of 20 mm which is the same magnitude as those reported in literatures esaki et al 1999 koyama et al 2006 since the nominal contact area between two fracture walls of fracture plane 2 decreases with the increment of shear displacement in order to maintain a constant analyzed area a smaller model with a size of 100 50 50 mm is extracted from the central part of the original model at each shear displacement as illustrated in fig 2 c 2 2 fracture surface generation natural rock fractures usually have rough walls with the surfaces typically following a self affine fractal distribution which can be modeled using the fractional brownian motion fbm several approaches such as successive random additions sra the randomization of the weierstrass mandelbrot function and the fourier transformation have been attempted to employ fbm to generate the fracture surfaces voss 1985 madadi and sahimi 2003 in this study the sra algorithm is adopted to simulate the surface heterogeneity for its efficiency and straightforwardness in the two dimensional fbm the aperture asperity height of a fracture wall can be represented as a continuous and single valued function z x y then the stationary increment z x lx y ly z x y over the distance lag l has a gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance σ2 molz et al 1997 ye et al 2015 the statistical self affine property of fbm increment can be expressed as 1 z x r l x y r l y z x y 0 2 σ 2 r r 2 h σ 2 1 where represents the mathematical expectation h is the roughness exponent or hurst exponent varying from 0 to 1 and related to the 3d fractal dimension d f by d f 3 h family and vicsek 1991 wang et al 2016 r is a constant and σ 2 is the variance defined as 3 σ 2 r z x r l x y r l y z x y 2 liu et al 2004 developed a modified sra algorithm to generate the 3d self affine surface of a fracture which overcomes the problems associated in the traditional sar algorithms that generally produce stochastic fractal distribution of poor correlation property a series of 3d self affine surfaces were generated using liu s algorithm with h equaling to 0 51 0 58 and 0 65 respectively the interval between the points in both the x and y axe directions is 0 125 mm as a total 800 points along the x axis direction and 400 points along the y axis direction are generated fig 3 displays three examples of fracture surfaces with different h and it shows that a smaller h results in more precipitous asperities and a rougher fracture surface and vice versa for each h different random numbers are used to generate different surface asperities then two of the rough fractures that have different surface roughness and suffer different shear displacements were selected to form the 3d crossed fracture model as shown in fig 1 c the joint roughness coefficient jrc for fracture profile proposed by barton and choubey 1977 is calculated using the following equation tse and cruden 1979 4 jrc 32 2 32 47 log z 2 where z 2 is the root mean square of the first derivative of the profile and can be expressed in the discrete form 5 z 2 1 n t z i 1 z i x i 1 x i 2 1 2 where x i and z i represent the coordinates of the fracture surface profile and n t is the number of sampling points along the length of a fracture the average of jrc values for a series of profiles along a surface in the direction parallel to shear direction is calculated which is the suggested method by the international society for rock mechanics and rock engineering isrm to calculate the jrc of a 3d single fracture isrm 1981 the spacing of 2d profiles is 1 mm as a total the jrc values of 50 2d profiles are calculated and their average value is regarded as the jrc of a 3d single fracture the calculated jrc equals to 6 12 and 18 corresponding to h 0 65 0 58 and 0 51 respectively 2 3 aperture assignment since the hydraulic responses of the fracture network depend on the aperture distribution within each fracture plane it is important to accurately model the variation of aperture during shear in this study the two walls of a fracture are assumed to be well mated at the initial state and the initial aperture equals to zero before the shear starts when the height of fracture surface generated using the modified sra method is described using the function z x y the fracture aperture b at the shear displacement u s can be calculated as 6 b x y z x u s y z x y u v i f z x u s y z x y u v 0 i f z x u s y z x y u v where u v is the normal displacement at u s indraratna et al 2015 proposed the following combined equations to calculate u v 7 u v 0 u s v d u s 8 v 0 for 0 u s u s peak c 0 v peak 1 1 c

is the compressive strength of the joint surface k ni is the initial fracture normal stiffness at zero normal stress v m is the maximum closure of the fracture σn0 is the initial normal stress and m is the damage coefficient that equals to 1 or 2 depending on the magnitude of normal stress olsson and barton 2001 a small initial normal stress of 1 mpa as shown in table 1 is applied and an assumption is made that m 1 therefore asperity degradation or surface damage is not considered in the present primary study before the simulation of the shear on fracture plane 2 the aperture field of fracture plane 1 should be assigned the aperture fields calculated under the shear of fracture plane 1 with u 1 4 12 and 20 mm respectively are assigned to represent its different initial states here u 1 is the shear displacement of plane 1 for each u 1 u 2 4 8 12 16 and 20 mm are respectively considered the parameters used in the simulation are summarized in table 1 three different rough surfaces for fracture plane 1 jrc1 6 12 and 18 three different rough surfaces for fracture plane 2 jrc2 6 12 and 18 three initial states of fracture plane 1 u 1 4 12 and 20 mm and five shear displacements of fracture plane 2 u 2 4 8 12 16 and 20 mm are considered and in total 135 cases are simulated here jrc1 and jrc2 represent the surface roughness of planes 1 and 2 respectively 3 flow calculation since the rock matrix surrounding the fractures is assumed to be impermeable the flow only takes place in the fracture planes the description of fluid flow in a single fracture can be modeled using the reynolds equation with variable permeability that is closely related to apertures x y z are the coordinates in the 3d domain and x f y f f 1 and 2 are the local coordinates in the fracture plane 1 if f 1 and or fracture plane 2 if f 2 the governing equation in each fracture is written as johnson and johnson 1987 méheust and schmittbuhl 2000 2001 13 x f ρ g b 3 12 μ h x f y f ρ g b 3 12 μ h y f 0 where h is the hydraulic head μ is the dynamic viscosity ρ is the fluid density and g is the gravitational acceleration reynolds equation which is a simplified form of navier stokes equation has been widely utilized to study the linear flow through rough fractures brown 1987 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 vilarrasa et al 2011 dreuzy et al 2012 this is accomplished by dividing the void space within the fracture into a great number of small simplified parallel plates then geological roughness of the fracture can be incorporated into the model by assigning spatially variable values to b in eq 13 however in the present study the nonlinear flow of fluid is not considered due to the time consuming work of solving a set of coupled nonlinear partial derivatives of varying orders brush and thomson 2003 javadi et al 2014 in the 3d crossed rock fracture model the flow equation at each fracture is complemented with the continuity condition on the fracture intersections s k k 1 and 2 written as 14 h k f h k f 1 2 v k f n k f 0 where h k is the hydraulic head on intersection s k h k f is the trace of the hydraulic head on s k in fracture plane f v k f is the flow velocity through the intersection in fracture plane f and n k f is the normal unit vector on the boundary s k of fracture plane f the boundary conditions on the model are consisted of fixed hydraulic heads at the inlet and outlet faces as shown in fig 2 c and no flow occurs at the other four faces which can be summarized as 15 h h 1 on γ f γ in h h 2 on γ f γ out h n 0 on γ f γ imp where γf is the border of fracture f γin and γout are the inlet boundary and outlet boundary respectively γimp is the four impermeable faces n is the normal unit vector of the boundary h 1 is the hydraulic head applied on the inlet surface that equals to 10 mm and h 2 is the hydraulic head applied on the outlet face that equals to 0 as a result a constant hydraulic gradient of 0 1 is applied on the model the galerkin s method is used to solve eq 13 to simulate the flow processes in crossed fracture model during shear this method to solve flow through single fracture is classical but the continuity conditions should be well addressed prior to the solving of the flow the computation procedure is depicted in fig 4 after the generation of the geometrical model the next step is to define the mesh in order to guarantee the mass conservation in each fracture the mesh is required to be 2d in each fracture plane at the same time the discretization of the intersections is uniquely defined to apply the continuity conditions between the two intersecting fractures in this study the model is meshed using 160 000 small triangular elements applying the galerkin scheme to the eq 13 the discretized formulation of the equation becomes 16 m 1 n r m h m m 1 n f m with 17 r m s m b m t d m b m d s 18 f m l m n m t ρ g b 3 12 μ h x n x ρ g b 3 12 μ h y n y d l where n is the total number of elements m is the element number n x and n y represents the unit normal vector to the boundary in x and y directions r m is the local transmissivity matrix f m is flux vector and s m n m h m and l m are surface area shape function matrix and the boundary in which the flow rate is known respectively the matrices d m and b m are defined as 19 d m ρ g b m 3 12 μ 0 0 ρ g b m 3 12 μ 20 h x h y n m t x n m t y h m b m h m considering the continuity conditions in the intersections the discretized flow equation for the two crossed fractures can be expressed as the following matrix form 21 a 0 a 21 a 12 0 x n x i b n 0 where a 0 is the total stiffness matrix for each fracture plane a 12 and a 21 represent the continuity conditions x n is the hydraulic heads on all nodes x i is the local flux on the intersection nodes and it is an auxiliary variable and b n represents the boundary conditions a matlab program is developed to solve the above flow equations the flow velocity on each element is evaluated by differentiating the calculated hydraulic head and the flux q through the model is equal to the summation of the flow rate of each element on the outlet boundary then the equivalent permeability k of the model is back calculated using the following equation 22 q a k μ δ p l where a is the cross area of the inlet outlet face l is the length of the model and δp is the pressure difference between inlet and outlet boundaries 4 results and analysis in this section the effects of fracture surface roughness and shear displacement on geometrical and hydraulic properties of crossed rock fracture model were analyzed in which the roughness of two fracture planes the initial aperture distribution of fracture plane 1 and the shear displacement of fracture plane 2 were considered besides the systematic characterization of the connectivity and equivalent permeability of the model the overall flow response influenced by fracture intersection was analyzed 4 1 aperture distribution and flow channel the fracture aperture which is defined as the separation distance between the two facing topographies in the direction perpendicular to the mean plane of fracture is essential to estimate the hydraulic response of the crossed fracture model fig 5 shows the aperture frequency curves during shear for fractures with different jrc the value of b 0 represents the contact points between the upper and lower fractures and the contact area decreases with the increment of shear displacement for all samples as shear displacement increases the aperture frequency curves change from sharp to flat and the aperture corresponding to the maximum frequency when aperture is larger than 0 moves rightward comparison between the aperture frequency curves of three surfaces with different jrcs under the same shear displacement indicates a similar tendency this indicates that both the increments of shear displacement and fracture roughness result in the increment of the mean fracture aperture this tendency has been observed in many shear analyses of single rough fractures power and durham 1997 koyama et al 2006 xiong et al 2011 an example of the aperture distribution of the crossed fracture model under different u 2 and different jrc2 is shown in fig 6 in which the state of fracture plane 1 is fixed with jrc1 12 and u 1 12 mm the results show that when u 2 u 1 and jrc2 jrc1 i e fig 6 a the void space of fracture plane 1 is more complex than that of fracture plane 2 whereas when u 2 u 1 and jrc2 jrc1 i e fig 6 i the void space of fracture plane 2 is more complex than that of fracture plane 1 the previous investigations have shown that the fluids in single rough fractures tend to select a path through a few high transmissivity areas flow channels as a result the flow pathlines become very tortuous this phenomenon is channeling effect that arises from the heterogeneous aperture distributions tsang and tsang 1987 watanabe et al 2009 dreuzy et al 2012 maillot et al 2016 in order to examine the channeling flow effect in the 3d crossed fracture model the main flow paths in the models with the aperture distributions shown in fig 6 are calculated the results are displayed in fig 7 in which the preferential flow paths consist of the elements with the ratios of local flow rate to the total flow rate larger than 0 005 for a smaller u 2 the contact area of fracture plane 2 is larger indicating that most of the fracture segments are contacted or have a negligibly small aperture as u 2 increases some larger void spaces start to appear in fracture plane 2 and gradually converge into a few main channels this phenomenon is more obvious for a larger jrc with a dramatic decrease of contact area the distribution of aperture in fracture plane 1 is not changed in the shear progress of fracture plane 2 however the flow pattern through the whole model changes greatly with the increasing of u 2 and jrc2 for the model with u 2 4 mm and jrc2 6 fluids mainly flow through the fracture plane 1 as u 2 increases for example for the model with u 2 20 mm and jrc2 6 fluid flow at the entrance changes from being concentrated in the fracture plane 1 to the fracture plane 2 but the flow at the exit is still mainly occupied by the fracture plane 1 as the jrc2 increases for the model with u 2 4 mm and jrc2 18 both the two fractures contribute to fluid flow into the model when u 2 increases to 20 mm and jrc2 increases to 18 the fracture plane 2 dominates the fluid flow out of the model while the contribution of fracture plane 1 to fluid flow can be negligible the preferential flow paths exist in the noncontact regions of aperture distribution and are gradually changed mainly due to two reasons the apertures of fracture plane 2 are increased with the increasing u 2 and jrc2 and the segment c alters the flow redistribution between fracture plane 1 and fracture plane 2 these numerical results provide important information regarding the diversity of flow patterns during the shear of 3d crossed fracture model as shown in fig 8 the average contact area accounts for approximately 5 27 of the fracture planes depending on different u 1 and u 2 therefore the remaining noncontact area of about 73 95 of the fracture planes may be the channels in which fluid flows however due to the non uniform aperture distributions the fluid flows along with some least resistant flow paths as a result the actual calculated flow area is about 38 55 of the fracture planes which is smaller than the noncontact area ratio the residual area of about 35 40 of the fracture planes is the stagnant area when u 1 increases from 4 mm to 20 mm the contact area ratio decreases about 10 46 and the flow area ratio increases about 7 78 of the fracture planes when u 2 increases from 4 mm to 20 mm the contact area ratio decreases about 11 09 and the flow area ratio increases about 7 79 of the fracture planes both the variations are more obvious at a smaller shear displacement 4 2 redistribution of fluid flow during shear in order to quantify the flow variation through the model during shear the comparisons of flow rate ratios between two flow fracture planes at the outlet boundary are shown in fig 9 each case corresponds to an initial state of fracture plane 1 with different u 1 and jrc1 the value close to 1 0 indicates a dominated flow plane while the value close to 0 0 indicates on the contrary that the fracture contributes negligibly to the total flow for all cases the results of fracture plane 1 and fracture plane 2 with the same jrc2 are symmetric along with the dished line of 0 5 as u 2 increases the flow rate ratio of fracture plane 1 decreases and the flow rate ratio of fracture plane 2 increases when the flow rate ratio of fracture plane 1 is smaller than 0 5 at u 2 4 mm i e fig 9 a the two datasets will directly diverge from each other if the flow rate ratio of fracture plane 1 is larger than 0 5 at u 2 4 mm i e fig 9 i with the increasing u 2 the flow rate ratios of the two fracture planes will be closer to each other and then approach to 0 5 indicating that the fracture plane 2 plays an increasingly important role at a larger u 2 generally when the parameters of fracture plane 1 i e jrc1 and u 1 are close to those of fracture plane 2 i e jrc2 and u 2 the flow rates through the two fracture planes tend to be equal when the flow rate ratios of the two fracture planes equal to 0 5 the corresponding shear displacement of fracture plane 2 is denoted as u 2e the correlation between u 1 u 2e and jrc1 jrc2 is displayed in fig 10 generally u 1 u 2e decreases with the increment of jrc1 jrc2 following a power function that has a negative exponent when jrc1 jrc2 1 the u 1 is slightly larger than u 2e there are potentially two reasons 1 the aperture distributions of the two fracture planes having the same jrc are randomly assigned and 2 the segment c tends to decrease the connectivity between the two parts of fracture plane 1 compared with its original shear induced flow connectivity in order to analyze the influence of segment c on the permeability of fracture plane 1 the flow rate q 1 of fracture plane 1 at the outlet boundary of the model with parameters of jrc1 jrc2 u 1 and u 2 is compared with the flow rate q 0 of fracture plane 1 calculated from the model with same parameters while fracture plane 2 is not sheared then the variation of q 1 q 0 with respect to jrc1 jrc2 and u 1 u 2 is calculated and illustrated in fig 11 when jrc1 jrc2 1 and u 1 u 2 1 q 1 q 0 is generally larger than 1 because the shear induced segment c by fracture plane 2 is more permeable than that of fracture plane 1 when jrc1 jrc2 1 and u 1 u 2 1 the shear induced segment c by fracture plane 2 is less permeable and will break the original flow channels in fracture plane 1 as a result q 1 q 0 is smaller than 1 for other cases with jrc1 jrc2 1 and u 1 u 2 1 or jrc1 jrc2 1 and u 1 u 2 1 the influences of jrc1 jrc2 and u 1 u 2 are competitive jrc1 jrc2 1 tends to decrease the permeability while u 1 u 2 1 tends to enhance the permeability by allowing the fluid to flow through the more permeable segment c and vice versa in such cases the value of q 1 q 0 will dispersedly distribute around 1 4 3 permeability 4 3 1 evolution of permeability during shear the evolutions of k of the crossed fracture model with respect to u 2 are illustrated in fig 12 when u 2 increases from 0 to 4 mm the variation of k depends on the influences of segment c on the conductivity of fracture plane 1 and the mean aperture increment of fracture plane 2 for example when jrc1 6 and u 1 4 mm k increases as u 2 increases from 0 to 4 mm for all models with different jrc2 this is mainly because that when u 2 increases to 4 mm the permeability of fracture plane 2 increases however since u 2 u 1 the shear induced segment c by fracture plane 2 would decrease the permeability of fracture plane 1 therefore when jrc1 and u 1 are small i e jrc1 6 and u 1 4 mm the permeability increment of fracture plane 2 is larger than the permeability decrement of fracture plane 1 as a result the k of the crossed fracture model increases as shown in fig 12 a on the contrary when jrc1 18 and u 1 20 mm k decreases as u 2 increases from 0 to 4 mm for all models with different jrc2 this is because that u 2 is much smaller than u 1 the permeability of fracture plane 2 would increase slightly compared with the original permeability of fracture plane 1 however the shear induced segment c by fracture plane 2 would significantly decrease the permeability of fracture plane 1 therefore an overall decrement of k of the crossed fracture model is obtained as shown in fig 12 i for all cases as u 2 continuously increases by up to 20 mm the increment of permeability of fracture plane 2 plays a more dominate role consequently k increases but the increasing rate decreases comparisons among the k of the cases with different jrc2 show that k increases slightly as u 1 increases both jrc1 and jrc2 have significant influences on k and k increases with the increment of fracture surface roughness when the shear displacement is fixed 4 3 2 effect of fracture roughness on permeability fluid flow in rock fractures is commonly simulated using parallel plate model in the early studies which is a simplification of the real rough rock fractures tsang and witherspoon 1981 schrauf and evans 1986 other previous studies have shown that the fluid flow through single rough fracture is heavily channelized and the flow rate predicted using the rough fracture models is approximately 70 90 of that predicted using the parallel plate models brown 1987 to study this issue for the crossed fracture model the internally heterogeneous fractures in the crossed model are replaced by two parallel plates in which the aperture of each parallel plate model is equal to the mean mechanical aperture of the corresponding rough fracture the comparisons of the equivalent permeability predicted using the rough crossed fracture model and equivalent parallel crossed plate model are shown in fig 13 where the surface roughness and initial state of fracture plane 1 are fixed as jrc1 6 and u 1 4 mm results show that despite of jrc2 the k predicted using the rough model is approximately 26 80 of that of the parallel model because in the rough model the channeling effect is robust and most of the void spaces between the two fracture walls do not or negligibly contribute to fluid flow however in the parallel model these noncontact regions have been assigned a uniform aperture that significantly devotes to fluid flow another potential reason is that the aperture is simplified from the heterogenous distribution in the rough fracture model to the uniform distribution in the parallel plate model in the cubic law the flow rate is linearly proportional to the cube of aperture and such a simplification would vary the permeability therefore to realistically simulate the fluid flow and or solute transport in rock fractures the rough crossed fracture model should be utilized and the channeling flow should be considered 4 3 3 shear induced anisotropy of permeability the permeability anisotropy of single rough fractures during shear has been extensively investigated in previous studies lee and cho 2002 auradou et al 2005 koyama et al 2006 2008 matsuki et al 2010 generally the permeability in the direction perpendicular to fluid flow is several times larger than that in the direction parallel to fluid flow in this section we would estimate the permeability anisotropy of rough crossed fracture model during shear the comparisons of equivalent permeability in x direction k x and in y direction k y is shown in fig 14 a by fixing jrc1 6 and u 1 4 mm here the x direction is the flow direction and the y direction is the direction perpendicular to fluid flow as shown in fig 2 c results show that with the increment of u 2 both k x and k y increase but the increasing rate decreases gradually to quantify the anisotropy the variation of ky kx versus u 2 is plotted in fig 14 b with jrc2 increasing from 6 to 18 the ky kx ranges from 1 31 to 3 67 which shows a similar range with the results of koyama et al 2006 2008 and huang et al 2017b as tabulated in table 2 this indicates that the permeability anisotropy of crossed fractures is similar with that of single fractures 5 conclusions this study established a series of 3d crossed fracture models to study the combined effects of fracture surface roughness and shear displacement on the geometrical and hydraulic properties different combinations of surface roughness of the two fractures in the model were considered in which the fracture surfaces were generated using the modified successive random additions sra algorithm shear displacement was applied on the one fracture by fixing the aperture and surface roughness of another fracture fluid flow through the model was simulated and the evolutions of aperture flow channel equivalent permeability and the flow rate ratio between two fractures were estimated by comparing the equivalent permeability of rough crossed fracture model with respect to the equivalent permeability of the corresponding parallel crossed fracture model the influences of fracture roughness on the permeability were analyzed the changes of permeability in directions perpendicular and parallel to shear direction were quantified to illustrate the shear induced permeability anisotropy in crossed fracture model the results show that during the shear the average contact area accounts for approximately 5 27 of the fracture planes and the actual calculated flow area is about 38 55 of the fracture planes which is smaller than the noncontact area as the fracture surface roughness and or shear displacement changes the main flow paths through the model may change from mainly existing in one fracture to another fracture which reveals the diversity of flow patterns during the shear of 3d crossed fracture network model the flow rate ratios between two fractures at the outlet boundary change as shear displacement increases accompanied with the redistribution of flow at the intersection part between two fractures the equivalent permeability of model will either increase or decrease as shear displacement increases from 0 to 4 mm depending on the aperture distribution of intersection part between two fractures when shear displacement continuously increases by up to 20 mm the equivalent permeability increases sharply first and then keeps increasing with a lower gradient the equivalent permeability of rough fractured model is about 26 80 of that calculated from the parallel plate model which indicates the channelized flow path inside the fracture reduces its permeability the equivalent permeability in the direction perpendicular to shear direction is approximately 1 31 3 67 times larger than that in the direction parallel to shear direction which is similar with the phenomenon in single fractures although these numerical results provide findings of significant interest in the future a thorough investigation should be conducted because of the limitation of the fracture size intersection angle and shear model considered in this study in the present model the influence of the anisotropic mechanical load on the fracture plane 1 is not considered which is potentially correlated to the intersection angle in the future study we plan to extend our investigation to more realistic models to examine the flow behaviors of simple fracture networks under shear stress acknowledgments this study has been partially funded by national natural science foundation of china china
