14125,this work presents an environmentally friendly synthesis of tio2 nanoparticles assisted by microwave from titanium tetrachloride and water with potential for the treatment of petroleum refinery effluent anatase nanocrystalline particles with a mean crystallite size of 14 nm were obtained according to xrd tem and eels characterization uf permeate from a membrane bioreactor treating real refinery effluent was subjected to photodegradation in the presence of the catalyst synthesized under uv c irradiation the highest percentages of toc and tn removals were 32 and 67 respectively under ph conditions equal to 10 and catalyst concentration of 100 mg l 1 in 90 min of reaction for this condition electrical energy per order ee0 calculated were 356 29 kwh m 3 order 1 the catalyst exhibited stability for 4 cycles the obtained data show that the synthesized catalyst is a promising tool for the removal of residual recalcitrant organic matter of the uf effluent from membrane bioreactor contributing to the reduction of fouling in downstream polishing processes as reverse osmosis aiming the industrial water reuse keywords photocatalytic degradation titanium dioxide refinery wastewater microwave synthesis membrane bioreactor 1 introduction pollution control has been a major concern of the industrial sector given the high potential impact of its activities on the environment the presence of more restrictive environmental laws on wastes or effluents disposal industry pressure for sustainable eco friendly practices costs of effluent disposal and water scarcity in some cases have driven more stringent effluents treatments and reuse 1 3 the oil industry in particular has a high water consumption in its most diverse operations such as cracking and distillation thus generating a high volume of effluents the reuse in this segment is therefore an alternative that can bring economic and environmental benefits 4 5 the traditional treatment occurs through mechanical methods and the biological processes are commonly used as a secondary treatment step being followed by polishing processes such as adsorption membrane filtration and reverse osmosis 6 7 however due to the presence of a high concentration of toxics aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons besides the presence of phenolic and recalcitrant compounds the biological processes alone are not able to meet the reuse quality 8 the literature reports many works with technologies aiming the refinery wastewater treatment in order to produce reuse water and membrane bioreactors mbrs are highlighted 9 11 mbr is a combination of biological and membranes separations processes and is an ideal technology for non potable water reuse because of the superior quality effluent it produces compared to conventional clarification processes due to the advantages like high sludge age and total removal of suspended solids 12 however one limitation of the mbrs technology is the low rejection of low molecular weight compounds ions and viruses by the ultrafiltration membranes uf 13 the uf permeate may contain recalcitrant organic compounds ions and biological organic waste as soluble microbial product smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps that may affect subsequent polishing steps by other membrane separation processes such as reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf and reverse electrodialysis edr for reuse in cooling towers or boilers 14 15 this is because these compounds are potential fouling agents that reduce permeate flux and raise transmembrane pressure thereby increasing cleaning frequencies and membrane changes increasing operating costs and energy consumption in addition such compounds when rejected by ro nf and edr membranes make it difficult to treat the concentrate because the presence of organic matter has inhibitory effects on crystallization which eventually hinders proper separation 16 based on this the removal of residual organic matter of the uf effluent produced by the membrane bioreactor prior to the polishing processes is necessary and the advanced oxidative processes aops are shown to be promising for the pretreatment of membrane separation processes such as oi nf and edr 17 18 the aops have attracted special attention in the treatment of water and wastewater for being efficient in the degradation of toxic and recalcitrant pollutants and by the possibility to convert them to simple and non dangerous inorganic molecules and even may eliminate some heavy metals by precipitation in metal hydroxides 19 the mechanism of the process occurs by the formation of hydroxyl radicals that are the strongest oxidizing agents in aqueous solution after fluorine 20 among the different configurations of aops processes the heterogeneous photocatalysis with titanium dioxide tio2 is highlighted because the oxide is one of the most versatile materials that adds the advantages of low cost non toxicity photostability and ease of synthesis and use thus its applications extend from the degradation of organic pollutants to energy generation 21 the oxide is found in nature in three polymorphs anatase rutile and brookite the anatase phase is the most extensively studied due to its high photoactivity low electron hole recombination rate and nanometric stability 22 the preference for use of the material at the nanoscale is for the reason that nanoparticles have a high surface volume ratio and high surface areas implying higher reaction rates 23 24 when tio2 is irradiated by uv light its electrons e are excited from the valence band to the conduction band leaving positive gaps h also called holes in the valence band vb electrons and gaps migrate to the surface of the oxide and participate in a series of oxi reduction reactions electrons reduce ti4 iv to ti3 iii and consequently reduce oxygen adsorbed on the surface of tio2 generating superoxide radicals o2 positive gaps react with water molecules generating hydroxyl radicals oh organic compounds may react with the formed radicals being oxidized to co2 and water radicals also have the ability to inactivate microorganisms bacteria and viruses 25 26 the tio2 performance can be influenced by several parameters such as the surface area of the material crystalline structure and density of surface hydroxyl groups all of which may differ according to the route of synthesis adopted 27 29 different methods of tio2 synthesis have been studied such as the sol gel process hydrothermal method solvothermal reverse microemulsions and microwave 30 33 methods as hydrothermal or sol gel for example require long synthesis times and high calcination temperatures as well as the use of multiple steps and reagents which can generate aggregation of the particles and contamination of the product 34 35 an alternative route of synthesis considered faster with lower energy consumption and efficient is the one that makes use of microwaves 36 37 microwave reactions were reported as reducing the time in hydrothermal synthesis by 1 3 besides producing unique crystals and lower losses 38 39 in this method the microwave energy is transmitted directly to the material through interactions with the magnetic field generating homogeneous nucleation and uniform growth of the nanoparticles 40 41 this synthesis route are in line with green chemistry principles highlighting the points of the design for energy efficiency and derivatives reduce 42 by this way the catalyst synthesized in this paper is called green among the various applications of tio2 its use in the treatment of petroleum refinery effluent deserves to be highlighted 43 19 this is because the photocatalysis using tio2 indicates promising results in the degradation of persistent compounds from this effluent mohd hir et al 44 obtained 73 degradation of benzene toluene and xylene in the treatment of refinery effluent using tio2 topare et al 45 achieved a 60 cod removal from the refinery effluent by tio2 uv treatment laoufi et al 46 achieved phenol removals above 90 by using tio2 catalyst major part of the experiments was developed using commercial catalyst other authors associated the tio2 to other oxidizing agents to improve the performance of the catalyst as for example h2o2 47 or o2 injection by aeration 48 the literature reports many studies involving the degradation of isolated molecules by tio2 catalyst but there is a lack of thematic in the case of real complex matrix effluents and catalysts developed through cleaner routes moreover the major part of the studies involving aops in the refinery effluent treatment uses reagents that are consumed in the reaction differently of what happens in the heterogeneous catalysis with titanium dioxide considering the panorama of the scientific researches the present work presents the synthesis of tio2 nanoparticles in an environmentally friendly way through a fast route and with reduced consumption of reagents assisted by microwave anatase single phase nanoparticles were obtained and assessed structurally and morphologically tests of catalyst application were carried out in the degradation of real refinery effluent post a membrane bioreactor and the process efficiency was measured by toc and tn removals in order to determine the best degradation conditions a series of experiments were conducted varying the phs of the medium the results obtained in this study associated to the ease of production of the material in a clean way and with the reduction of reagents can help in the application of nanoparticles in the removal of refinery effluent recalcitrant contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 refinery effluent post uf mbr the effluent used to feed the photocatalytic reactor came from the gabriel passos regap oil refinery located in the state of minas gerais brazil this went through primary treatment in the own plant consisting of a water and oil separator equalizer and float after the primary stage the effluent was treated at room temperature 25 1 c by a bench scale membrane bioreactor mbr which comprises a 4 5 l biological reactor with constant aeration around 0 5 nm3 h 1 in which a hollow fiber uf membrane average pores diameter 0 04 μm and 0 047 m2 area from ge water was submerged the biological sludge concentration was maintained at approximately 2 g l 1 and the ph adjusted to around 7 0 the uf mbr was operated under hydraulic retention time of 6 h and sludge retention time of 45 days the ultrafiltration permeate flow rate was maintained at 0 55 l h 1 the uf permeates from the mbr were the samples used for the photodegradation tests with tio2 to avoid changes in the features they were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c its main physicochemical characteristics are described in table 1 2 2 reagents the reagents used in the subsequent steps of the present work were 1 10 phenatroline fluka ammonium hydroxide nh4oh sigma aldrich ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o synth methylene blue exodo científica potassium oxalate k2c2o4 synth sodium acetate trihydrate ch3coona 3h2o fluka sodium hydroxide naoh dinâmica titanium tetrachloride ticl4 merck sulfuric acid h2so4 vetek all solutions were prepared with milli q ultra pure water 2 3 photocatalyst synthesis the catalyst was synthesized based on the study of li and zeng 49 by means of modification in the route by reduction of chemical reagents 150 ml of distilled water was added to 6 ml of titanium tetrachloride ticl4 in a round bottom flask immersed in an ice bath to the mixture was added 10 ml of ammonium hydroxide to adjust the ph to 8 a slightly basic ph favors the formation of the anatase single phase 50 the system was allowed to stir in the bath for 30 min after this time the reaction mixture was taken to the microwave milestone start d which was set at a heating ramp which reached 80 c in 6 min and maintained this temperature for 4 min after this period another cooling ramp was done to reach 50 c in 20 min the material obtained was washed and centrifuged at 3500 rpm several times until neutral ph was reached then it was kept in the kiln for drying at 85 c for 2 h and finally calcined at 400 c according to a programmed heating ramp 2 4 description of the apparatus used in the study the photodegradation reactions were performed in a cylindrical purepro ultraviolet water sterilizer reactor 50 5 320 mm and 280 ml capacity with a quartz tube inside a low pressure mercury vapor lamp 6 w emitting radiation at 254 nm was connected to the quartz tube the experimental apparatus for the tests consisted of the reactor a diaphragm pump and a rotameter to verify the circulation flow as shown in fig 1 2 5 photocatalyst performance uf permeate from uf mbr purifying the tests using the refinery effluent post uf mbr were performed at 25 c to determine optimized conditions for the reduction of the organic matter of the effluent various ph values of the medium in a fixed catalyst concentration were tested at the concentration of 100 mg l 1 of the catalyst tests were carried out at phs 2 4 6 8 and 10 the phs were corrected with solutions of 0 1 mol l 1 naoh and 0 1 n h2so4 after the batchs the treated effluents were analyzed in terms of toc and tn all the tests were conducted using 150 ml of the effluent and each reaction lasted for 90 min the stirring was maintained in the reaction system by the current formed by the use of the pump the percentage of toc removal was calculated according to eq 1 1 r t o c 0 t o c f t o c 0 x 100 where r is the percentage toc removal t o c 0 is the initial toc t o c f is the final toc to determine the total nitrogen and the absorbance at 254 nm abs254 removals the calculation procedure analogous to that described in eq 1 were performed the energy consumption is an important information to be analyzed in processes which use electric energy as the heterogeneous catalysis therefore electric energy per order eeo is a very useful and informative figure of merit to measure the balance between the energy required to achieve a certain toc removal originally ee0 is defined as the number of kilowatt hours of electrical energy required to reduce the concentration of a pollutant by 1 order of magnitude 90 in a unit volume of contaminated water specifically at this work as all the experiments at various ph were conducted in 90 min the ee0 were calculated considering the toc removal achieved at this time as described by eq 2 2 e e 0 p x t x 1000 v x 60 x l o g c 0 c where p is the electric power input kw from uv lamp to the aop system t is the irradiation time min v is the volume of treated effluent l in reactor and co and c are initial and final toc concentrations mg l 1 respectively the term that uses logarithm is due to the fact that ee0 was concept and appropriated to be used in the first order kinetic regime of aops when the low pollutant concentrations are dissolved in solution 28 2 6 analytical methods after synthesis the catalyst was characterized by x ray diffraction shimadzu xrd 7000 x ray diffractometer copper tube kα λ 1 54056 å voltage of 30 kv current of 30 ma and scanning speed 0 05 s 1 to verify the crystallographic phase of the formed oxide and estimate the average crystallite size by the debye scherrer equation transmission electron microscopy fei tecnai g2 20 microscope with lab6 thermionic filament tube acceleration voltage of 200 kv was performed to verify the morphology and distribution of the particle sizes of the material the samples were prepared by dispersing them in ethanol using sonication and then one drop of the suspension was deposited on a carbon coated copper grade the crude effluent as well as the currents treated in the photodegradation were characterized by ph using qualxtron qx 1500 phmeter conductivity in the hanna conductivity meter toc and tn in the shimadzu toc v cnp toc analyzer equipment in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 51 concentrations of the solutions in the actinometric test were measured by uv vis perkinelmer spectrophotometer lambda xl by means of calibration curves the readings of the abs254 values of the samples were performed before and after the treatment in the same equipment to evaluate the removal of aromatic rings from the wastewater the luminous intensity of the mercury vapor lamp was determined by the actinometric test using the potassium ferrioxalate reagent as described by murov 52 the light intensity determined was 5 5 10 5 einstein min 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization fig 2 shows the diffractogram of the synthesized tio2 photocatalyst all the obtained peaks are well defined corresponding to the crystallographic planes 101 103 200 105 213 116 107 characteristics of the anatase phase and are in agreement with the diffraction pattern pdf 1 562 this result evidences that the adopted route prioritizes the formation of the pure anatase phase since no brookite or rutile peak has been identified the synthesis developed in the present work is aligned with the principles of cleaner methods since crystalline titanium dioxide purified in the anatase phase was obtained with the saving of reagents starting only from titanium tetrachloride and water in addition the microwave technique makes it possible to obtain the material in a shorter time when compared to conventional techniques it was necessary hours for the synthesis of the catalyst in this work while days are required in other techniques 53 corradi et al 54 obtained crystalline particles at synthesis time of 32 h by hydrothermal method lin et al 55 obtained anatase nanoparticles within 17 h by the solvotermal method pang et al 56 obtained oxide nanoparticles after 51 h by the sol gel method mohadesi and ranjbar 57 also obtained materials with a single phase however their precursors were titanium tetraisopropoxide water and nitric acid in addition other authors using a microwave based synthesis technique obtained polymorphs from precursors such as titanium tetraisopropoxide 58 and tetra n butyl titanate 34 the average crystallite size estimated by the debye scherrer equation was 14 nm based on the most intense peak relative to the anatase phase 101 located at 2θ 25 10 tem images fig 3 a b have shown that the synthesized particles are of the nanometric order and are aggregated such aggregation may be related to the absence of steps such as sonication after synthesis 58 as well as being a result of the high reaction rates in the microwave processes 35 by the analysis of fig 3 a and b it is possible to note that the particles have dimensions between 8 and 30 nm which was confirmed by the image study carried out with the aid of imagej software whose product is the histogram shown in fig 3 c in the histogram it can be verified that the highest percentage of the particles has dimensions between 11 and 16 nm and through the normal distribution curve it can be seen that the crest occurs around 14 nm this value is in agreement with that obtained by the debye scherrer equation due to the fact that the material was calcined the particles were expected to be above 10 nm 59 from the high resolution image fig 3 b the interplanar spacing in the well defined crystals was measured and the distance found was 0 35 nm corresponding to the 101 plane of the anatase fig 4 a shows the electron diffraction pattern of the sample and confirms its polycrystallinity by the presence of concentric rings indicating crystallographic planes that grew in different orientations each of the rings was indexed according to pdf 1 562 and the values correspond to the tio2 in the anatase phase the intense brightness of the well defined rings reveals that the material has completely crystallized the electron loss spectrum eels obtained from the sample fig 4 b coincides with the spectrum available in the atlas eels for tio2 60 61 corroborating the other results that the sample consists of titanium and oxygen in the form of titanium dioxide 3 2 photocatalytic activity of the synthesized tio2 in the degradation of the uf permeate from a membrane bioreactor treating refinery effluent fig 5 shows the toc and tn removals achieved by the degradation tests all the tests were performed at the same time of 90 min and at the same concentration of catalyst being only the ph changed in the values 2 4 6 8 and 10 as can be seen under the conditions of phs 8 and 10 more expressive toc removals values are obtained a removal of approximately 32 toc is achieved after 90 min of photocatalytic reaction at phs 8 and 10 in the ph 10 54 of abs254 removal was obtained this fact is explained by the complexity of the organic compounds in the oil refinery effluents which can be in the positive neutral or negative forms 62 the raw effluent before the photodegradation tests was at ph 7 08 the surface of the tio2 is amphoteric that is it has the characteristics of acid or base according to the ph of the medium this phenomenon is related to the zero load point phzpc of the catalyst being equal to 6 2 63 in acid medium ph 6 2 the catalyst surface is positively charged while in basic medium ph 6 2 it is negatively charged and three species are involved at this context tio tioh2 and tioh according to eqs 3 4 64 3 tioh h tioh2 at ph phzpc 4 tioh oh tio h2o at ph phzpc in acid media the predominant oxidative species are the vacancies in the valence band h while oh are predominant in basic media because more hydroxyl ions will be available on the tio2 surface to be oxidized by raising the photocatalytic potential 65 in the neutral media the surface of the oxide presents the same behavior as in the basic media because the ph in this condition is greater than its phzpc considering the catalyst better performance in toc removal in alkaline medium it is inferred that most of the compounds present in the treated effluent have a positive charge favoring the electrostatic attraction between the species and the catalyst hence increasing the rate of degradation it is worth mentioning that the effluent used by the present work underwent a treatment step in a membrane bioreactor that promoted the removal of about 90 of the organic matter from the crude refinery effluent 16 which can generate different results with regards to optimized ph conditions when compared to other studies with petroleum refinery effluent ani et al 19 present a work in which the degradation of methyl phenyl sulfide was favored in alkaline medium while methyl benzimidazole sulfide was better degraded at neutral ph shahrezaei et al 62 found a higher percentage of organic pollutants removal in the refinery effluent at ph 3 while pakravan et al 66 noticed an increase in photodegradation by raising the ph from 3 to 6 as previously stated the nature of the effluent greatly impacts on the percentage of degradation in the presence of the catalyst and in particular the effluent of the present study has undergone a previous treatment the compounds removed at the photocatalytic process stage are those difficult to be degraded biological and mbr thus the removals achieved for the complex matrix effluent whose components are recalcitrant are considerable given the short treatment time 90 min these results are endorsed by the values of absorbance at 254 nm a reduction in abs254 of 54 was achieved after 90 min of treatment the selected wavelength is associated with the absorption peak of the aromatic rings including double or triple bonds this class of compounds in the refinery effluent are constituted by polyaromatic hydrocarbons benzene toluene xylene and several phenols thus the decrease in abs254 is indicative of removal or structural modifications of these compounds 67 69 in relation to total nitrogen tn it is observed that with the increase of ph the greater the removals and the best percentage of 67 removal was reached in ph 10 the effluent has a high loading of phenolic compounds that inhibit nitrification by microorganisms limiting the efficacy of the biological treatment processes in tn removal 70 therefore advanced oxidative processes have been reported in the literature as an alternative for the conversion of ammonia and organic nitrogen to nitrogen or nitrate gas in these effluents 71 which is corroborated by the data obtained in the present work on what reduced treatment times 90 min in the presence of the catalyst practically 70 tn was removed fig 5 ammonia nh3 establishes with ammonium ions nh4 an equilibrium in water which is disadvantageous in the ammonia direction at phs higher than 8 5 9 so can be concluded that nt removal occurred by the oxidation or adsorption and not by stripping the kinetic study of toc removal in the presence of tio2 catalyst revealed that the first order kinetic model fitted very well the data with a correlation coefficient r2 equal to 0 96 being adequate to describe the mechanism fig 6 thus the figure of merit ee0 can be used to determine the energy expenditure in each one of the conditions tested table 2 summarizes the ee0 values and as can be seen higher phs promote a less energy consumption to remove an order of toc regarding the catalyst dose more efficient utilization of photons occurs in low concentrations this is an interesting result especially when thinking about the escalation to larger dimensions low catalyst dose besides propitiating savings in the purchase of reagent provides less energy consumption the ee0 result in the best condition evaluated ph 10 and catalyst concentration 100 mg l 1 is 3 38 times smaller than in the worst condition of ph removal ph 2 to determine the reusability and recyclability of the catalyst in the photocatalysis under uv irradiation the degradation tests in the best condition found 100 mg l 1 ph 10 were performed several times and the data obtained are shown in fig 7 at each repetition the catalyst was washed with distilled water and filtrated by a membrane the results indicate certain stability of the photocatalyst being possible to use it at least 4 times it suggests that although there is a contribution of the adsorption for the toc and tn removal the low loss of performance with the catalyst reuse indicates that with the photocatalytic activity the oxidation of the adsorbed materials occurs releasing active sites 4 conclusion nanoparticles of pure titanium dioxide in the anatase phase with a mean crystallite size of 14 nm were obtained by an environmentally friendly microwave assisted route under mild conditions with low consumption of chemical reagents and reduced reaction time they were efficient in the degradation of organic molecules the synthesized material was promising in the treatment of petroleum refinery effluent since under the best condition tested and in a relatively low reaction time of 90 min it removed 32 toc from the effluent and 67 nt in ph equal to 10 and catalyst dose of 100 mg l 1 the electrical energy per order ee0 in this condition was 356 29 kwh m 3 order 1 the catalyst was shown to be stable for reuse at least four times the results showed that tio2 is a promising tool in the removal of recalcitrant compounds of difficult degradation in the refinery effluent and can bring benefits if used in a step before the polishing processes with a view to reuse thus it is suggested that other studies can be conducted to evaluate alternatives for catalyst retention and additives that increase the percentage of degradation of the pollutants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

this period another cooling ramp was done to reach 50 c in 20 min the material obtained was washed and centrifuged at 3500 rpm several times until neutral ph was reached then it was kept in the kiln for drying at 85 c for 2 h and finally calcined at 400 c according to a programmed heating ramp 2 4 description of the apparatus used in the study the photodegradation reactions were performed in a cylindrical purepro ultraviolet water sterilizer reactor 50 5 320 mm and 280 ml capacity with a quartz tube inside a low pressure mercury vapor lamp 6 w emitting radiation at 254 nm was connected to the quartz tube the experimental apparatus for the tests consisted of the reactor a diaphragm pump and a rotameter to verify the circulation flow as shown in fig 1 2 5 photocatalyst performance uf permeate from uf mbr purifying the tests using the refinery effluent post uf mbr were performed at 25 c to determine optimized conditions for the reduction of the organic matter of the effluent various ph values of the medium in a fixed catalyst concentration were tested at the concentration of 100 mg l 1 of the catalyst tests were carried out at phs 2 4 6 8 and 10 the phs were corrected with solutions of 0 1 mol l 1 naoh and 0 1 n h2so4 after the batchs the treated effluents were analyzed in terms of toc and tn all the tests were conducted using 150 ml of the effluent and each reaction lasted for 90 min the stirring was maintained in the reaction system by the current formed by the use of the pump the percentage of toc removal was calculated according to eq 1 1 r t o c 0 t o c f t o c 0 x 100 where r is the percentage toc removal t o c 0 is the initial toc t o c f is the final toc to determine the total nitrogen and the absorbance at 254 nm abs254 removals the calculation procedure analogous to that described in eq 1 were performed the energy consumption is an important information to be analyzed in processes which use electric energy as the heterogeneous catalysis therefore electric energy per order eeo is a very useful and informative figure of merit to measure the balance between the energy required to achieve a certain toc removal originally ee0 is defined as the number of kilowatt hours of electrical energy required to reduce the concentration of a pollutant by 1 order of magnitude 90 in a unit volume of contaminated water specifically at this work as all the experiments at various ph were conducted in 90 min the ee0 were calculated considering the toc removal achieved at this time as described by eq 2 2 e e 0 p x t x 1000 v x 60 x l o g c 0 c where p is the electric power input kw from uv lamp to the aop system t is the irradiation time min v is the volume of treated effluent l in reactor and co and c are initial and final toc concentrations mg l 1 respectively the term that uses logarithm is due to the fact that ee0 was concept and appropriated to be used in the first order kinetic regime of aops when the low pollutant concentrations are dissolved in solution 28 2 6 analytical methods after synthesis the catalyst was characterized by x ray diffraction shimadzu xrd 7000 x ray diffractometer copper tube kα λ 1 54056 å voltage of 30 kv current of 30 ma and scanning speed 0 05 s 1 to verify the crystallographic phase of the formed oxide and estimate the average crystallite size by the debye scherrer equation transmission electron microscopy fei tecnai g2 20 microscope with lab6 thermionic filament tube acceleration voltage of 200 kv was performed to verify the morphology and distribution of the particle sizes of the material the samples were prepared by dispersing them in ethanol using sonication and then one drop of the suspension was deposited on a carbon coated copper grade the crude effluent as well as the currents treated in the photodegradation were characterized by ph using qualxtron qx 1500 phmeter conductivity in the hanna conductivity meter toc and tn in the shimadzu toc v cnp toc analyzer equipment in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 51 concentrations of the solutions in the actinometric test were measured by uv vis perkinelmer spectrophotometer lambda xl by means of calibration curves the readings of the abs254 values of the samples were performed before and after the treatment in the same equipment to evaluate the removal of aromatic rings from the wastewater the luminous intensity of the mercury vapor lamp was determined by the actinometric test using the potassium ferrioxalate reagent as described by murov 52 the light intensity determined was 5 5 10 5 einstein min 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization fig 2 shows the diffractogram of the synthesized tio2 photocatalyst all the obtained peaks are well defined corresponding to the crystallographic planes 101 103 200 105 213 116 107 characteristics of the anatase phase and are in agreement with the diffraction pattern pdf 1 562 this result evidences that the adopted route prioritizes the formation of the pure anatase phase since no brookite or rutile peak has been identified the synthesis developed in the present work is aligned with the principles of cleaner methods since crystalline titanium dioxide purified in the anatase phase was obtained with the saving of reagents starting only from titanium tetrachloride and water in addition the microwave technique makes it possible to obtain the material in a shorter time when compared to conventional techniques it was necessary hours for the synthesis of the catalyst in this work while days are required in other techniques 53 corradi et al 54 obtained crystalline particles at synthesis time of 32 h by hydrothermal method lin et al 55 obtained anatase nanoparticles within 17 h by the solvotermal method pang et al 56 obtained oxide nanoparticles after 51 h by the sol gel method mohadesi and ranjbar 57 also obtained materials with a single phase however their precursors were titanium tetraisopropoxide water and nitric acid in addition other authors using a microwave based synthesis technique obtained polymorphs from precursors such as titanium tetraisopropoxide 58 and tetra n butyl titanate 34 the average crystallite size estimated by the debye scherrer equation was 14 nm based on the most intense peak relative to the anatase phase 101 located at 2θ 25 10 tem images fig 3 a b have shown that the synthesized particles are of the nanometric order and are aggregated such aggregation may be related to the absence of steps such as sonication after synthesis 58 as well as being a result of the high reaction rates in the microwave processes 35 by the analysis of fig 3 a and b it is possible to note that the particles have dimensions between 8 and 30 nm which was confirmed by the image study carried out with the aid of imagej software whose product is the histogram shown in fig 3 c in the histogram it can be verified that the highest percentage of the particles has dimensions between 11 and 16 nm and through the normal distribution curve it can be seen that the crest occurs around 14 nm this value is in agreement with that obtained by the debye scherrer equation due to the fact that the material was calcined the particles were expected to be above 10 nm 59 from the high resolution image fig 3 b the interplanar spacing in the well defined crystals was measured and the distance found was 0 35 nm corresponding to the 101 plane of the anatase fig 4 a shows the electron diffraction pattern of the sample and confirms its polycrystallinity by the presence of concentric rings indicating crystallographic planes that grew in different orientations each of the rings was indexed according to pdf 1 562 and the values correspond to the tio2 in the anatase phase the intense brightness of the well defined rings reveals that the material has completely crystallized the electron loss spectrum eels obtained from the sample fig 4 b coincides with the spectrum available in the atlas eels for tio2 60 61 corroborating the other results that the sample consists of titanium and oxygen in the form of titanium dioxide 3 2 photocatalytic activity of the synthesized tio2 in the degradation of the uf permeate from a membrane bioreactor treating refinery effluent fig 5 shows the toc and tn removals achieved by the degradation tests all the tests were performed at the same time of 90 min and at the same concentration of catalyst being only the ph changed in the values 2 4 6 8 and 10 as can be seen under the conditions of phs 8 and 10 more expressive toc removals values are obtained a removal of approximately 32 toc is achieved after 90 min of photocatalytic reaction at phs 8 and 10 in the ph 10 54 of abs254 removal was obtained this fact is explained by the complexity of the organic compounds in the oil refinery effluents which can be in the positive neutral or negative forms 62 the raw effluent before the photodegradation tests was at ph 7 08 the surface of the tio2 is amphoteric that is it has the characteristics of acid or base according to the ph of the medium this phenomenon is related to the zero load point phzpc of the catalyst being equal to 6 2 63 in acid medium ph 6 2 the catalyst surface is positively charged while in basic medium ph 6 2 it is negatively charged and three species are involved at this context tio tioh2 and tioh according to eqs 3 4 64 3 tioh h tioh2 at ph phzpc 4 tioh oh tio h2o at ph phzpc in acid media the predominant oxidative species are the vacancies in the valence band h while oh are predominant in basic media because more hydroxyl ions will be available on the tio2 surface to be oxidized by raising the photocatalytic potential 65 in the neutral media the surface of the oxide presents the same behavior as in the basic media because the ph in this condition is greater than its phzpc considering the catalyst better performance in toc removal in alkaline medium it is inferred that most of the compounds present in the treated effluent have a positive charge favoring the electrostatic attraction between the species and the catalyst hence increasing the rate of degradation it is worth mentioning that the effluent used by the present work underwent a treatment step in a membrane bioreactor that promoted the removal of about 90 of the organic matter from the crude refinery effluent 16 which can generate different results with regards to optimized ph conditions when compared to other studies with petroleum refinery effluent ani et al 19 present a work in which the degradation of methyl phenyl sulfide was favored in alkaline medium while methyl benzimidazole sulfide was better degraded at neutral ph shahrezaei et al 62 found a higher percentage of organic pollutants removal in the refinery effluent at ph 3 while pakravan et al 66 noticed an increase in photodegradation by raising the ph from 3 to 6 as previously stated the nature of the effluent greatly impacts on the percentage of degradation in the presence of the catalyst and in particular the effluent of the present study has undergone a previous treatment the compounds removed at the photocatalytic process stage are those difficult to be degraded biological and mbr thus the removals achieved for the complex matrix effluent whose components are recalcitrant are considerable given the short treatment time 90 min these results are endorsed by the values of absorbance at 254 nm a reduction in abs254 of 54 was achieved after 90 min of treatment the selected wavelength is associated with the absorption peak of the aromatic rings including double or triple bonds this class of compounds in the refinery effluent are constituted by polyaromatic hydrocarbons benzene toluene xylene and several phenols thus the decrease in abs254 is indicative of removal or structural modifications of these compounds 67 69 in relation to total nitrogen tn it is observed that with the increase of ph the greater the removals and the best percentage of 67 removal was reached in ph 10 the effluent has a high loading of phenolic compounds that inhibit nitrification by microorganisms limiting the efficacy of the biological treatment processes in tn removal 70 therefore advanced oxidative processes have been reported in the literature as an alternative for the conversion of ammonia and organic nitrogen to nitrogen or nitrate gas in these effluents 71 which is corroborated by the data obtained in the present work on what reduced treatment times 90 min in the presence of the catalyst practically 70 tn was removed fig 5 ammonia nh3 establishes with ammonium ions nh4 an equilibrium in water which is disadvantageous in the ammonia direction at phs higher than 8 5 9 so can be concluded that nt removal occurred by the oxidation or adsorption and not by stripping the kinetic study of toc removal in the presence of tio2 catalyst revealed that the first order kinetic model fitted very well the data with a correlation coefficient r2 equal to 0 96 being adequate to describe the mechanism fig 6 thus the figure of merit ee0 can be used to determine the energy expenditure in each one of the conditions tested table 2 summarizes the ee0 values and as can be seen higher phs promote a less energy consumption to remove an order of toc regarding the catalyst dose more efficient utilization of photons occurs in low concentrations this is an interesting result especially when thinking about the escalation to larger dimensions low catalyst dose besides propitiating savings in the purchase of reagent provides less energy consumption the ee0 result in the best condition evaluated ph 10 and catalyst concentration 100 mg l 1 is 3 38 times smaller than in the worst condition of ph removal ph 2 to determine the reusability and recyclability of the catalyst in the photocatalysis under uv irradiation the degradation tests in the best condition found 100 mg l 1 ph 10 were performed several times and the data obtained are shown in fig 7 at each repetition the catalyst was washed with distilled water and filtrated by a membrane the results indicate certain stability of the photocatalyst being possible to use it at least 4 times it suggests that although there is a contribution of the adsorption for the toc and tn removal the low loss of performance with the catalyst reuse indicates that with the photocatalytic activity the oxidation of the adsorbed materials occurs releasing active sites 4 conclusion nanoparticles of pure titanium dioxide in the anatase phase with a mean crystallite size of 14 nm were obtained by an environmentally friendly microwave assisted route under mild conditions with low consumption of chemical reagents and reduced reaction time they were efficient in the degradation of organic molecules the synthesized material was promising in the treatment of petroleum refinery effluent since under the best condition tested and in a relatively low reaction time of 90 min it removed 32 toc from the effluent and 67 nt in ph equal to 10 and catalyst dose of 100 mg l 1 the electrical energy per order ee0 in this condition was 356 29 kwh m 3 order 1 the catalyst was shown to be stable for reuse at least four times the results showed that tio2 is a promising tool in the removal of recalcitrant compounds of difficult degradation in the refinery effluent and can bring benefits if used in a step before the polishing processes with a view to reuse thus it is suggested that other studies can be conducted to evaluate alternatives for catalyst retention and additives that increase the percentage of degradation of the pollutants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

as iii and 100 mg g for as v the arsenic adsorption rate was governed by pseudo second order kinetics the positive values of δso 0 0084 0 0047 kj mol k indicated increased randomness onto gpl as iii or as v interface the positive δho values as iii 16 8 as v 9 7 kj mol implied endothermic adsorption the negative values of δg o as iii 9 2 as v 5 0 kj mol suggested spontaneity of the adsorption process the reusability of gpl up to four adsorption desorption cycles and its capability to remove arsenic species at the ppb levels and from real wastewater samples spiked with arsenic proved the gpl composite as an efficient economical and environment compatible adsorbent for sequestration of arsenic species from water wastewater keywords gelatin pva la2o3 composite arsenic adsorption 1 introduction the worsening arsenic poisoning of natural water resources particularly in the developing countries including bangladesh india pakistan nepal china and cambodia 1 has aroused much serious concern mainly due to its lethal effect on human health arsenic exposure which can occur through inhalation or by consuming contaminated food and water leads to nausea abdominal pain vomiting diarrhea and hemolysis long term exposure may develop skin discoloration and lesions redness and hyperkeratosis arsenic is carcinogenic and teratogenic and can cause skin bladder lung and kidney cancer on sustained exposure 2 encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy are common manifestation of acute arsenic toxicity 3 4 chronic exposure may cause cardiovascular cerebrovascular peripheral vascular respiratory diseases diabetes mellitus 5 and neutropenia 6 among various as iii and as v species in water such as aso3 3 haso3 2 h2aso3 and aso4 3 haso4 2 h2aso4 respectively 7 8 aso3 3 arsenite and aso4 3 arsenate occur predominantly arsenite being 60 times more toxic than arsenate the us epa and who have prescribed a maximum permissible level of 10 ppb arsenic concentration in the drinking water in view of prevalent adverse effects of high level of arsenic it is of utmost priority to reduce arsenic concentration in water major arsenic treatment methods include coagulation filtration precipitation membrane separation ion exchange electrochemical and adsorption 9 10 adsorption has been established as the most affordable convenient and effective technique due to its high efficiency availability of wide range of adsorbent materials and operational simplicity 11 iron based adsorbents 12 nanomaterials 13 oxide coated materials 14 15 and activated carbons 16 have been frequently used for the adsorption of arsenic however most of these conventional adsorbents demonstrated low adsorption capacities and difficulty in regeneration in recent years polymer based composite materials have received lot of attention as prospective adsorbents for arsenic decontamination due their biodegradability eco compatibility cost effectiveness and non toxic character natural polymers such as chitosan alginate and cellulose have been utilized as attractive resources for bio composite adsorbents for arsenic removal 17 chitosan α alumina biocomposite has been studied for as v and as iii uptake from aqueous solution with adsorption capacity of 79 4 and 74 6 mg g respectively 18 adsorptive removal of arsenic species by nanoalumina dispersed in chitosan grafted polyacrylamide cts g pa q m 6 56 mg g 19 mno2 impregnated calcium alginate beads 6 5 mg g 20 and cellulose nanocomposite 21 have been reported gelatin acquired usually from partial hydrolysis of collagen extracted from animal skin and bones is a natural water soluble biodegradable polymer since it contains substantial number of amino carboxyl and hydroxyl groups gelatin is expected to demonstrate remarkable adsorption capability gelatin offers several advantages as being non toxic biocompatible non immunogenic abundantly available and inexpensive but for weak mechanical strength and fast degradability in water the mechanical properties and degradation rate of gelatin can be improved through cross linking using bifunctional aldehydes 22 and incorporation of lanthanum oxide glutaraldehyde is generally used as cross linker owing to its low cost biodegradability commercial availability and reactivity polyvinyl alcohol pva is a water soluble non poisonous and biocompatible synthetic polymer with good mechanical properties 23 the glutaraldehyde may cross link with lysine nh2 group of gelatin and adjacent oh groups of polyvinyl alcohol through acetal bridges 24 thus forming a cross linked co polymer biodegradable gelatin pva porous scaffold has recently been reported for skin regeneration application 25 previous studies 26 27 have revealed that lanthanum hydr oxide materials are quite effective as adsorbents for pollutants removal from wastewater recently la2o3 modified sawdust has been reported for the removal of arsenite 22 mg g and arsenate 28 mg g from water 28 in view of this it was considered worthwhile to incorporate the beneficial effects of gelatin pva and la2o3 by carrying out the synthesis of a novel composite adsorbent by embedding lanthanum hydr oxide into a cross linked gelatin pva co polymer gelatin pva la2o3 gpl the use of gelatin containing various ligands such as lysine proline and hydroxyproline residues and pva having numerous hydroxyl groups along with lanthanum oxide in the composite preparation may lead to enhancement of mechanical properties and improvement in adsorption capacity probably due to increased binding capability of the composite towards different pollutants in this study the viability of gpl composite for the adsorptive uptake of as iii and as v from liquid phase has been evaluated under different conditions of ph initial arsenic concentration gpl dosage and time the equilibrium adsorption data was evaluated using langmuir freundlich d r and temkin isotherms and pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models the thermodynamics of the adsorption process has been assessed in terms of δg δh and δs parameters 2 materials and instruments all chemicals reagents were of ar grade lanthanum trioxide 99 9 was purchased

sodium hydroxide 99 were obtained from merck india ftir spectra of la2o3 and gpl composite were recorded with perkin elmer spectrometer model bx spectrum usa sem images were taken with carl zeiss joel sigma 5 05 germany scanning electron microscope the residual concentration of as iii and as v was determined with t80 uv vis spectrophotometer pg instrument ltd uk philips analytica pw 1830 apparatus panalytical with monochromated cukα1 radiation was used to obtain the xrd spectrum of the gpl composite 3 synthesis of gelatin pva la2o3 gpl composite the gpl composite was synthesized by cross linking of gelatin and pva using glutaraldehyde as a cross linker in the presence of la2o3 aqueous solution of gelatin 20 w w was prepared by dissolving the hydrated polymer at 55 c in a thermostatic bath the pva solution 2 w w was prepared by homogenizing the biopolymer with distilled water for 30 min and dissolved at 90 c using a magnetic stirrer 24 both the solutions were mixed and homogenized at 60 c for 10 min under magnetic stirring different composites were prepared by adding varying quantities of la2o3 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 g under stirring followed by glutaraldehyde 0 5 ml and the stirring continued for 30 min maintaining the reaction temperature at 60 c the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min and the resulting gel was poured into ethanol 200 ml for dewatering the solid product thus obtained was washed dried in an oven at 50 c for 48 h ground to powder form and finally stored in a desiccator the composite synthesized using la2o3 1 g exhibited better adsorptive properties thus was used for further analysis 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of gelatin pva la2o3 composite the specific surface area pore radius and pore volume were determined by bet and bjh methods fig 1 a and b displays the n2 adsorption desorption and pore diameter curves respectively of the gpl the bet surface area pore volume and pore diameter of gpl are 53 511 m2 g 0 148 cm3 g and 7 158 nm respectively table 1 the surface morphology of gpl was determined by scanning electron micrograph sem analysis sem image fig 2 a discerns rough irregular and highly porous surface of gpl with the presence of ample pores and grooves of different shapes and sizes that is mainly responsible for high surface area and the higher adsorption capacity of the composite fig 2b c of the composite after arsenic adsorption shows nearly smooth texture which confirms the adsorption of arsenic molecules onto the surface and into the interior pores of the gpl the edx spectra of the corresponding sem image are also shown in fig 2b c the presence of arsenic in the edx spectra of arsenic loaded gpl suggested the adsorption of arsenic onto the gpl surface the ftir spectra of la2o3 and gelatin pva are shown in fig 3 a the spectrum shows absorption bands at 3605 and 631 cm 1 which may be assigned to hydroxyl groups and la o stretching vibrations of lanthanum hydr oxide respectively 29 the weak absorption bands at 1464 and 1058 cm 1 are ascribed to the presence of carbonate impurities 30 the gelatin pva spectrum displays peaks at 3227 2897 1631 1525 1237 and 1086 cm 1 which are assigned to hydroxyl stretching c h symmetrical stretching co and nh stretching nh bending c n stretching and c o stretching vibrations respectively after composite formation the ftir spectra exhibit the characteristic bands of gelatin and pva at nearly the same positions fig 3b but with slight shifting in some of the peaks the shifting of the broad band at 3227 cm 1 to 3406 cm 1 may be due to the interaction of nh2 and oh groups with la2o3 the shifting of characteristic la o stretching vibration band to 603 cm 1 supports the formation of composite fig 3b the ftir spectra of gpl as iii and gpl as v show strong intensity band at 586 cm 1 which may be due to the adsorption of arsenic onto the composite surface further an increase in the intensity of absorption peaks at 3406 and 1525 cm 1 in ftir spectra of arsenic loaded gpl as compared to the composite may be due to the interaction of oh nh2 groups with arsenic species 18 x ray diffraction analysis of la2o3 gelatin pva and gpl are shown in fig 4 the x ray diffraction of la2o3 jcpds 74 1144 displays number of peaks a strong intensity peak at the diffraction angle of 14 and 30 is assigned to 011 plane while other peaks for the different planes are observed at 26 100 29 002 39 012 44 003 46 110 48 111 52 103 and 56 021 31 the xrd spectrum of gelatin pva depicts partial crystallinity with a broad peak at 19 32 on addition of la2o3 into the polymer matrix xrd spectrum of composite shows characteristic peaks of lanthanum oxide with some shifting in the diffraction angle 30 to 29 and 39 to 33 indicating the formation of composite 4 2 batch adsorption studies the adsorption studies of as iii or as v onto gpl were conducted by equilibrating the arsenic solution 25 ml of different concentrations 50 100 mg l at ph 2 10 with a known amount of gpl 0 4 2 8 g l in 50 ml conical flasks at constant temperature the contact time was optimized between 10 60 min and the equilibrium was reached at 50 min after that the adsorbent was separated by centrifugation the supernatant liquid was analyzed spectrophotometrically at 840 nm to determine the residual concentration of arsenic the amount of arsenic species adsorbed at equilibrium qe was calculated using the following equation eq 1 1 q e c o c e w v where co and ce are the arsenic concentration before adsorption and at equilibrium respectively w g l is the amount of gpl composite and v is the volume of arsenic solution the percentage adsorption was calculated from equation eq 2 2 a d s o r p t i o n c o c e c o 100 the adsorption isotherm studies were performed by treating 25 ml of arsenic solution 50 100 mg l with 2 g l and 1 2 g l of gpl for as iii and as v respectively at different temperatures the adsorption kinetic studies were conducted by equilibrating 90 mg l of as iii and as v solution with 2 g l and 1 2 g l of gpl respectively at constant ph for 10 60 min contact time 4 3 effect of adsorption parameters 4 3 1 effect of dose the varying amount of gpl 0 4 2 8 g l was used for evaluation of the effect of dose on the uptake of as iii and as v using initial arsenic concentration 90 mg l time 50 min and temperature 308 k the same is depicted in figure s1 which illustrate that the as iii removal increases from 65 to 96 as the amount of the adsorbent is increased from 0 8 to 2 g l however as v removal increases from 86 to 98 5 with increase in adsorbent dose from 0 4 to 1 2 g l with further increase in the adsorbent quantity no significant increase in the adsorption of arsenic is noticed this may be due to the accomplishment of equilibrium between adsorbate and adsorbent 4 3 2 effect of ph since the initial ph of adsorbate solution can have significant effect on removal capacity of the gpl composite so adsorption of arsenic onto gpl was studied from 2 10 ph range using 2 g l and 1 2 g l of gpl for 90 mg l of as iii and as v concentration at 308 k fig 5 shows that maximum adsorption of as iii takes place at ph 5 and that of as v at ph 4 the variation in the adsorption of as iii and as v with ph is affected by two factors speciation of arsenic and phzpc of the gpl the increase in ph results in the decrease of as iii adsorption which may be understood it terms of the competition between negatively charged haso3 2 aso3 3 species and excess amount of oh ion for the active sites in alkaline medium at lower ph the h3o is higher resulting in enhanced magnitude of surface positive charge due protonation of hydroxyl carboxyl and amine groups leading to improved adsorption of as iii however as v uptake gradually increases with increasing ph up to 4 as a result of increased electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged haso4 2 h2aso4 species and positively charged adsorbent surface the adsorption efficiency however decreases at higher ph more than phzpc 5 2 because of the repulsion between negatively charged gpl surface and haso4 2 h2aso4 species the possible mechanism for the adsorption of as iii and as v species may be proposed as given below 33 r nh2 h3o haso4 2 r nh3 haso4 2 h2o r oh h3o haso4 2 r oh2 haso4 2 h2o ocinski et al 2016 accounted similar results of as iii and as v adsorption onto water treatment residuals containing fe and mn oxides surface in aqueous solution 34 4 3 3 effect of contact time the effect of contact time on the removal of as iii and as v studied using 2 g l and 1 2 g l of gpl composite respectively for variable time 10 60 min at optimized ph is shown in fig s2 it demonstrates that as the shaking time increases from 10 to 50 min the removal of arsenic also increases from 65 5 97 8 for as iii and 87 99 for as v thereafter no considerable increase in removal is observed which may be due to saturation of vacant adsorption sites onto gpl surface therefore 50 min contact time is selected for further studies similar adsorption behavior of as iii as v onto zirconium polyacrylamide and organo functionalized clay has been reported by mandal et al 2013 and guerra et al 2010 respectively 35 36 4 3 4 effect of initial arsenic concentration to study the effect of initial arsenic concentration on the removal as iii or as v concentration was varied between 50 and 100 mg l at optimized ph ph 4 for as iii and ph 5 for as v dose 2 g l for as iii 1 2 g l for as v and temperature 308 k the results shown in figure s3 indicate that removal of as iii decreases from 97 9 89 8 and that of as v from 99 1 96 9 with increase in the concentrations of the solution from 50 to 90 mg l indicating 90 mg l as the optimum as iii and as v concentration however further increase in arsenic concentration thereafter leads to a little change in adsorption which is indicative of the saturation of active sites onto the adsorbent surface similar trend in the adsorption of arsenic was demonstrated by various other researchers 37 38 with a view to assessing the efficacy of gpl composite for removing as iii v at ppb levels 50 and 100 ppb concentration of arsenic solution was treated with 2 g l for as iii and 1 2 g l for as v gpl dose at optimized conditions the results show that gpl composite removes 97 14 and 96 19 of as iii and as v respectively at 50 ppb while it uptake 96 23 as iii and 96 14 as v at 100 ppb level which indicates strong feasibility of the composite to remove arsenic at lower concentrations ppb levels too 4 3 5 effect of counter ions the adsorption of arsenic species onto the composite in the presence of nitrate sulphate carbonate and chloride counter ions 1 g l has been studied under optimum conditions the results reveal fig 6 that maximum removal occurs without counter ions however in the presence of coexisting ions the adsorption efficiency slightly decreases as iii 81 87 as v 93 96 probably due to competition between the arsenic species and counter ions present in the solution this study suggests that arsenic is selectively adsorbed onto the gpl surface even in the presence of counter ions 4 4 isotherm studies experiments for equilibrium adsorption isotherm were performed by treating 25 ml of arsenic solution 50 100 mg l with optimized adsorbent dose and ph at different temperatures langmuir 39 freundlich 40 temkin 41 and dubinin radushkevich 42 isotherm models are applied to the experimental data and the corresponding calculated parameters are summarized in table 2 the nonlinear form of langmuir equation is given as eq 3 3 q e q m b c e 1 b c e where q m mg g is langmuir adsorption capacity and b l mol is the langmuir constant associated with affinity between adsorbate and adsorbent the values of q m and b are calculated form qe vs ce curve fig 7 and are given in table 2 the q m values are in 57 61 mg g for as iii and 97 100 mg g range for as v the higher b values 0 34 1 5 indicate significant adsorbate adsorbent affinity the comparison of qm values of gpl with other adsorbents are given in table 3 43 49 the higher r 2 values in the range of 0 981 0 983 and 0 993 0

the r2 values for as iii and as v uptake are found to be 0 931 0 940 and 0 949 0 987 respectively table 2 the temkin isotherm in nonlinear form is expressed as eq 6 6 q e β t l n k t c e the values of equilibrium binding constant kt l g and heat of adsorption bt rt b t kj mol calculated from qe vs ce curve fig s5 are listed in table 2 the values of bt 0 114 0 186 kj mol at all studied temperatures suggest the physical nature of adsorption process dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm model gives information about mechanism of adsorption with energy distribution onto heterogeneous adsorbent surfaces the d r model is stated as eq 7 7 q e q d e x p k d l n 1 1 c e 2 where qd mg g is d r isotherm constant the plot of qe vs c e gives the qd value fig s6 the qd mg g values are in 55 09 57 94 range for as iii and 99 15 103 for as v as depicted in table 2 the kd mg g is the activity coefficient w h i c h can be correlated as eq 8 8 k d b d r 2 t 2 the energy for adsorption of arsenic e has been calculated by the following equation eq 9 9 e 1 2 b d the e values of 1 20 1 28 kj mol for adsorption of as iii and 2 08 5 90 kj mol for as v advocate physical adsorption the statistical prediction of best fitted isotherm model has been made on the basis of higher values of r 2 and lower values of standard error of estimation see the langmuir isotherm model provides the best fit isotherm with higher values of r 2 0 981 0 983 for as iii 0 993 0 996 for as v and lower values of see 1 13 1 21 for as iii 0 96 1 17 for as v the adsorption process was supposed to be homogenously monolayer onto the gpl surface 4 5 adsorption kinetics pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to determine the rate of the arsenic adsorption onto gpl the nonlinear form of pseudo first order eq 10 and pseudo second order eq 11 equations are expressed as 52 53 10 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 11 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where k 1 1 min is the pseudo first order rate constant and k 2 g mg min is pseudo second order rate constant the q t vs t plot furnishes k 1 k 2 and r 2 values fig 8 a b the calculated k 1 values are 18 10 2 and 24 10 2 1 min and k 2 values are 0 91 10 2 and 0 98

first ones 0 99 1 45 implying that the adsorption rate is governed by pseudo second order kinetics 4 6 diffusion mechanism of adsorption the diffusion mechanism of adsorption generally involves three major rate limiting steps liquid film diffusion 55 intraparticle diffusion 56 and interior surface diffusion the liquid film and intraparticle diffusion models can be expressed as eqs 12 and 13 respectively 12 l n 1 q e q t k f t 13 q t k i p t 0 5 c i where q e q t f and kf 1 min is liquid film diffusion rate constant k ip mg g min0 5 is intraparticle diffusion rate constant and ci is intercept reflecting the thickness of boundary layer according to liquid film diffusion and weber morris models the corresponding plots of ln 1 f vs t and q t vs t 0 5 fig s7a should be straight line passing through the origin the experimental data was fitted to both the models adsorption of arsenic is supposed to be completed in three steps i external surface adsorption phase due to the external mass transfer immediate adsorption stage ii gradual adsorption phase and iii final equilibrium phase due to low arsenic concentration the graph shows that the adsorption of as iii and as v are not linear over entire time range intraparticle diffusion is involved in the second and third phase of the adsorption process the kf 1 min and r2 values for as iii and as v are 0 082 and 0 070 0 99 and 0 98 respectively the calculated values of k ip ci and r2 for as iii and as v are 1 46 1 57 mg g min0 5 30 57 61 05 and 0 89 0 93 respectively it can be concluded from figure s7b that both models control the overall adsorption mechanism as the lines do not pass through the origin in both the plots 4 7 adsorption thermodynamics the parameters such as δg o gibbs free energy change δho enthalpy change and δso entropy change are calculated to evaluate the thermodynamic feasibility spontaneity and nature of the adsorption process using gibbs equation eq 14 and van t hoff equation eq 15 14 δ g 0 δ h 0 t δ s 0 15 l o g q e c e δ s 0 2 303 r δ h 0 2 303 r t the negative values of δg o for as iii 9 2 kj mol and as v 5 0 kj mol advocate thermodynamic feasibility and spontaneity of the adsorption process however positive values of δho 16 8 and 9 7 kj mol and δso 0 0084 and 0 0047 kj mol k for as iii and as v respectively imply endothermic adsorption and increased randomness onto gpl as iii as v interface 4 8 adsorption mechanism the adsorption mechanism of arsenic species onto the gpl surface at lower ph can be explained in terms of i electrostatic interaction between positively charged surface of gelatin nh3 group lanthanum hydr oxide and or hydroxide groups of pva and ii hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl group of lanthanum oxide and pva and amine group of gelatin and oxygen atom of the arsenic species as depicted in fig 9 however at higher ph the gpl surface acquires anionic charge causing the adsorption to decrease because of interionic repulsion 4 9 adsorption desorption studies to assess the economic feasibility of gpl the recovery of arsenic and regeneration of the adsorbent was tested simultaneously a fixed amount of adsorbent 50 mg was saturated with 25 ml of arsenate arsenite solution for 50 min the adsorbent was regenerated using 0 1 m of 25 ml sodium hydroxide during desorption studies sodium hydroxide neutralizes positively charged surface of gpl which weakens the forces of attraction between the adsorbent and arsenic molecules ions after fourth adsorption desorption cycle 66 and 90 of desorption occurs for as iii and as v respectively while it adsorbs 83 as iii and 77 as v fig s8 so the gpl can be used efficiently up to four cycles for uptake of arsenic from aqueous solution 4 10 removal of arsenic spiked in water obtained from real sources in order to evaluate the efficiency of gpl composite to remove arsenic species from real wastewater samples arsenic solutions of different concentrations 50 100 mg l spiked in water from real sources having ph 7 4 has been used it is observed that under optimized conditions the percent removal decreases from 96 2 88 85 for as iii and 98 95 96 86 for as v with increasing arsenic concentrations fig s9 this study suggests that the gpl composite can be effectively used for the arsenic removal from the real wastewater samples 5 conclusions a novel gelatin pva la2o3 porous composite adsorbent is synthesized and characterized by ftir xrd bet and sem with edx the surface area of gpl composite is 53 511m² g with pore volume of 0 148 cm3 g and pore diameter of 7 158 nm the gpl is used for the removal of arsenite and arsenate from aqueous phase the maximum adsorption capacity q m is calculated to be 61 mg g for as iii and 100 mg g for as v which demonstrates greater efficiency of the composite for as v removal the adsorption data is best fitted to the langmuir isotherm suggesting monolayer adsorption of arsenic onto the gpl the rate of adsorption of arsenic onto the gpl is governed by pseudo second order kinetics the positive δho values as iii 16 8 and as v 9 7 kj mol implies endothermic adsorption process however the negative values of δg o 9 2 for as iii and 5 0 kj mol for as v advocates thermodynamic spontaneity of the adsorption process the positive δso values as iii 0 0084 and as v 0 0047 kj mol k infers increased randomness at the gpl as iii as v interface adsorption desorption cycle shows that 66 and 90 desorption occur for as iii and as v respectively in the fourth cycle indicating its economic feasibility the gpl composite can effectively

process the reusability of gpl up to four adsorption desorption cycles and its capability to remove arsenic species at the ppb levels and from real wastewater samples spiked with arsenic proved the gpl composite as an efficient economical and environment compatible adsorbent for sequestration of arsenic species from water wastewater keywords gelatin pva la2o3 composite arsenic adsorption 1 introduction the worsening arsenic poisoning of natural water resources particularly in the developing countries including bangladesh india pakistan nepal china and cambodia 1 has aroused much serious concern mainly due to its lethal effect on human health arsenic exposure which can occur through inhalation or by consuming contaminated food and water leads to nausea abdominal pain vomiting diarrhea and hemolysis long term exposure may develop skin discoloration and lesions redness and hyperkeratosis arsenic is carcinogenic and teratogenic and can cause skin bladder lung and kidney cancer on sustained exposure 2 encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy are common manifestation of acute arsenic toxicity 3 4 chronic exposure may cause cardiovascular cerebrovascular peripheral vascular respiratory diseases diabetes mellitus 5 and neutropenia 6 among various as iii and as v species in water such as aso3 3 haso3 2 h2aso3 and aso4 3 haso4 2 h2aso4 respectively 7 8 aso3 3 arsenite and aso4 3 arsenate occur predominantly arsenite being 60 times more toxic than arsenate the us epa and who have prescribed a maximum permissible level of 10 ppb arsenic concentration in the drinking water in view of prevalent adverse effects of high level of arsenic it is of utmost priority to reduce arsenic concentration in water major arsenic treatment methods include coagulation filtration precipitation membrane separation ion exchange electrochemical and adsorption 9 10 adsorption has been established as the most affordable convenient and effective technique due to its high efficiency availability of wide range of adsorbent materials and operational simplicity 11 iron based adsorbents 12 nanomaterials 13 oxide coated materials 14 15 and activated carbons 16 have been frequently used for the adsorption of arsenic however most of these conventional adsorbents demonstrated low adsorption capacities and difficulty in regeneration in recent years polymer based composite materials have received lot of attention as prospective adsorbents for arsenic decontamination due their biodegradability eco compatibility cost effectiveness and non toxic character natural polymers such as chitosan alginate and cellulose have been utilized as attractive resources for bio composite adsorbents for arsenic removal 17 chitosan α alumina biocomposite has been studied for as v and as iii uptake from aqueous solution with adsorption capacity of 79 4 and 74 6 mg g respectively 18 adsorptive removal of arsenic species by nanoalumina dispersed in chitosan grafted polyacrylamide cts g pa q m 6 56 mg g 19 mno2 impregnated calcium alginate beads 6 5 mg g 20 and cellulose nanocomposite 21 have been reported gelatin acquired usually from partial hydrolysis of collagen extracted from animal skin and bones is a natural water soluble biodegradable polymer since it contains substantial number of amino carboxyl and hydroxyl groups gelatin is expected to demonstrate remarkable adsorption capability gelatin offers several advantages as being non toxic biocompatible non immunogenic abundantly available and inexpensive but for weak mechanical strength and fast degradability in water the mechanical properties and degradation rate of gelatin can be improved through cross linking using bifunctional aldehydes 22 and incorporation of lanthanum oxide glutaraldehyde is generally used as cross linker owing to its low cost biodegradability commercial availability and reactivity polyvinyl alcohol pva is a water soluble non poisonous and biocompatible synthetic polymer with good mechanical properties 23 the glutaraldehyde may cross link with lysine nh2 group of gelatin and adjacent oh groups of polyvinyl alcohol through acetal bridges 24 thus forming a cross linked co polymer biodegradable gelatin pva porous scaffold has recently been reported for skin regeneration application 25 previous studies 26 27 have revealed that lanthanum hydr oxide materials are quite effective as adsorbents for pollutants removal from wastewater recently la2o3 modified sawdust has been reported for the removal of arsenite 22 mg g and arsenate 28 mg g from water 28 in view of this it was considered worthwhile to incorporate the beneficial effects of gelatin pva and la2o3 by carrying out the synthesis of a novel composite adsorbent by embedding lanthanum hydr oxide into a cross linked gelatin pva co polymer gelatin pva la2o3 gpl the use of gelatin containing various ligands such as lysine proline and hydroxyproline residues and pva having numerous hydroxyl groups along with lanthanum oxide in the composite preparation may lead to enhancement of mechanical properties and improvement in adsorption capacity probably due to increased binding capability of the composite towards different pollutants in this study the viability of gpl composite for the adsorptive uptake of as iii and as v from liquid phase has been evaluated under different conditions of ph initial arsenic concentration gpl dosage and time the equilibrium adsorption data was evaluated using langmuir freundlich d r and temkin isotherms and pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models the thermodynamics of the adsorption process has been assessed in terms of δg δh and δs parameters 2 materials and instruments all chemicals reagents were of ar grade lanthanum trioxide 99 9 was purchased from loba chemie india ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate 98 ethanol 99 9 sodium arsenite 98 sodium arsenate heptahydrate 98 glutaraldehyde 25 tin ii chloride dihydrate 98 hydrochloric acid 37 and sodium hydroxide 99 were obtained from merck india ftir spectra of la2o3 and gpl composite were recorded with perkin elmer spectrometer model bx spectrum usa sem images were taken with carl zeiss joel sigma 5 05 germany scanning electron microscope the residual concentration of as iii and as v was determined with t80 uv vis spectrophotometer pg instrument ltd uk philips analytica pw 1830 apparatus panalytical with monochromated cukα1 radiation was used to obtain the xrd spectrum of the gpl composite 3 synthesis of gelatin pva la2o3 gpl composite the gpl composite was synthesized by cross linking of gelatin and pva using glutaraldehyde as a cross linker in the presence of la2o3 aqueous solution of gelatin 20 w w was prepared by dissolving the hydrated polymer at 55 c in a thermostatic bath the pva solution 2 w w was prepared by homogenizing the biopolymer with distilled water for 30 min and dissolved at 90 c using a magnetic stirrer 24 both the solutions were mixed and homogenized at 60 c for 10 min under magnetic stirring different composites were prepared by adding varying quantities of la2o3 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 g under stirring followed by glutaraldehyde 0 5 ml and the stirring continued for 30 min maintaining the reaction temperature at 60 c the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min and the resulting gel was poured into ethanol 200 ml for dewatering the solid product thus obtained was washed dried in an oven at 50 c for 48 h ground to powder form and finally stored in a desiccator the composite synthesized using la2o3 1 g exhibited better adsorptive properties thus was used for further analysis 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of gelatin pva la2o3 composite the specific surface area pore radius and pore volume were determined by bet and bjh methods fig 1 a and b displays the n2 adsorption desorption and pore diameter curves respectively of the gpl the bet surface area pore volume and pore diameter of gpl are 53 511 m2 g 0 148 cm3 g and 7 158 nm respectively table 1 the surface morphology of gpl was determined by scanning electron micrograph sem analysis sem image fig 2 a discerns rough irregular and highly porous surface of gpl with the presence of ample pores and grooves of different shapes and sizes that is mainly responsible for high surface area and the higher adsorption capacity of the composite fig 2b c of the composite after arsenic adsorption shows nearly smooth texture which confirms the adsorption of arsenic molecules onto the surface and into the interior pores of the gpl the edx spectra of the corresponding sem image are also shown in fig 2b c the presence of arsenic in the edx spectra of arsenic loaded gpl suggested the adsorption of arsenic onto the gpl surface the ftir spectra of la2o3 and gelatin pva are shown in fig 3 a the spectrum shows absorption bands at 3605 and 631 cm 1 which may be assigned to hydroxyl groups and la o stretching vibrations of lanthanum hydr oxide respectively 29 the weak absorption bands at 1464 and 1058 cm 1 are ascribed to the presence of carbonate impurities 30 the gelatin pva spectrum displays peaks at 3227 2897 1631 1525 1237 and 1086 cm 1 which are assigned to hydroxyl stretching c h symmetrical stretching co and nh stretching nh bending c n stretching and c o stretching vibrations respectively after composite formation the ftir spectra exhibit the characteristic bands of gelatin and pva at nearly the same positions fig 3b but with slight shifting in some of the peaks the shifting of the broad band at 3227 cm 1 to 3406 cm 1 may be due to the interaction of nh2 and oh groups with la2o3 the shifting of characteristic la o stretching vibration band to 603 cm 1 supports the formation of composite fig 3b the ftir spectra of gpl as iii and gpl as v show strong intensity band at 586 cm 1 which may be due to the adsorption of arsenic onto the composite surface further an increase in the intensity of absorption peaks at 3406 and 1525 cm 1 in ftir spectra of arsenic loaded gpl as compared to the composite may be due to the interaction of oh nh2 groups with arsenic species 18 x ray diffraction analysis of la2o3 gelatin pva and gpl are shown in fig 4 the x ray diffraction of la2o3 jcpds 74 1144 displays number of peaks a strong intensity peak at the diffraction angle of 14 and 30 is assigned to 011 plane while other peaks for the different planes are observed at 26 100 29 002 39 012 44 003 46 110 48 111 52 103 and 56 021 31 the xrd spectrum of gelatin pva depicts partial crystallinity with a broad peak at 19 32 on addition of la2o3 into the polymer matrix xrd spectrum of composite shows characteristic peaks of lanthanum oxide with some shifting in the diffraction angle 30 to 29 and 39 to 33 indicating the formation of composite 4 2 batch adsorption studies the adsorption studies of as iii or as v onto gpl were conducted by equilibrating the arsenic solution 25 ml of different concentrations 50 100 mg l at ph 2 10 with a known amount of gpl 0 4 2 8 g l in 50 ml conical flasks at constant temperature the contact time was optimized between 10 60 min and the equilibrium was reached at 50 min after that the adsorbent was separated by centrifugation the supernatant liquid was analyzed spectrophotometrically at 840 nm to determine the residual concentration of arsenic the amount of arsenic species adsorbed at equilibrium qe was calculated using the following equation eq 1 1 q e c o c e w v where co and ce are the arsenic concentration before adsorption and at equilibrium respectively w g l is the amount of gpl composite and v is the volume of arsenic solution the percentage adsorption was calculated from equation eq 2 2 a d s o r p t i o n c o c e c o 100 the adsorption isotherm studies were performed by treating 25 ml of arsenic solution 50 100 mg l with 2 g l and 1 2 g l of gpl for as iii and as v respectively at different temperatures the adsorption kinetic studies were conducted by equilibrating 90 mg l of as iii and as v solution with 2 g l and 1 2 g l of gpl respectively at constant ph for 10 60 min contact time 4 3 effect of adsorption parameters 4 3 1 effect of dose the varying amount of gpl 0 4 2 8 g l was used for evaluation of the effect of dose on the uptake of as iii and as v using initial arsenic concentration 90 mg l time 50 min and temperature 308 k the same is depicted in figure s1 which illustrate that the as iii removal increases from 65 to 96 as the amount of the adsorbent is increased from 0 8 to 2 g l however as v removal increases from 86 to 98 5 with increase in adsorbent dose from 0 4 to 1 2 g l with further increase in the adsorbent quantity no significant increase in the adsorption of arsenic is noticed this may be due to the accomplishment of equilibrium between adsorbate and adsorbent 4 3 2 effect of ph since the initial ph of adsorbate solution can have significant effect on removal capacity of the gpl composite so adsorption of arsenic onto gpl was studied from 2 10 ph range using 2 g l and 1 2 g l of gpl for 90 mg l of as iii and as v concentration at 308 k fig 5 shows that maximum adsorption of as iii takes place at ph 5 and that of as v at ph 4 the variation in the adsorption of as iii and as v with ph is affected by two factors speciation of arsenic and phzpc of the gpl the increase in ph results in the decrease of as iii adsorption which may be understood it terms of the competition between negatively charged haso3 2 aso3 3 species and excess amount of oh ion for the active sites in alkaline medium at lower ph the h3o is higher resulting in enhanced magnitude of surface positive charge due protonation of hydroxyl carboxyl and amine groups leading to improved adsorption of as iii however as v uptake gradually increases with increasing ph up to 4 as a result of increased electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged haso4 2 h2aso4 species and positively charged adsorbent surface the adsorption efficiency however decreases at higher ph more than phzpc 5 2 because of the repulsion between negatively charged gpl surface and haso4 2 h2aso4 species the possible mechanism for the adsorption of as iii and as v species may be proposed as given below 33 r nh2 h3o haso4 2 r nh3 haso4 2 h2o r oh h3o haso4 2 r oh2 haso4 2 h2o ocinski et al 2016 accounted similar results of as iii and as v adsorption onto water treatment residuals containing fe and mn oxides surface in aqueous solution 34 4 3 3 effect of contact time the effect of contact time on the removal of as iii and as v studied using 2 g l and 1 2 g l of gpl composite respectively for variable time 10 60 min at optimized ph is shown in fig s2 it demonstrates that as the shaking time increases from 10 to 50 min the removal of arsenic also increases from 65 5 97 8 for as iii and 87 99 for as v thereafter no considerable increase in removal is observed which may be due to saturation of vacant adsorption sites onto gpl surface therefore 50 min contact time is selected for further studies similar adsorption behavior of as iii as v onto zirconium polyacrylamide and organo functionalized clay has been reported by mandal et al 2013 and guerra et al 2010 respectively 35 36 4 3 4 effect of initial arsenic concentration to study the effect of initial arsenic concentration on the removal as iii or as v concentration was varied between 50 and 100 mg l at optimized ph ph 4 for as iii and ph 5 for as v dose 2 g l for as iii 1 2 g l for as v and temperature 308 k the results shown in figure s3 indicate that removal of as iii decreases from 97 9 89 8 and that of as v from 99 1 96 9 with increase in the concentrations of the solution from 50 to 90 mg l indicating 90 mg l as the optimum as iii and as v concentration however further increase in arsenic concentration thereafter leads to a little change in adsorption which is indicative of the saturation of active sites onto the adsorbent surface similar trend in the adsorption of arsenic was demonstrated by various other researchers 37 38 with a view to assessing the efficacy of gpl composite for removing as iii v at ppb levels 50 and 100 ppb concentration of arsenic solution was treated with 2 g l for as iii and 1 2 g l for as v gpl dose at optimized conditions the results show that gpl composite removes 97 14 and 96 19 of as iii and as v respectively at 50 ppb while it uptake 96 23 as iii and 96 14 as v at 100 ppb level which indicates strong feasibility of the composite to remove arsenic at lower concentrations ppb levels too 4 3 5 effect of counter ions the adsorption of arsenic species onto the composite in the presence of nitrate sulphate carbonate and chloride counter ions 1 g l has been studied under optimum conditions the results reveal fig 6 that maximum removal occurs without counter ions however in the presence of coexisting ions the adsorption efficiency slightly decreases as iii 81 87 as v 93 96 probably due to competition between the arsenic species and counter ions present in the solution this study suggests that arsenic is selectively adsorbed onto the gpl surface even in the presence of counter ions 4 4 isotherm studies experiments for equilibrium adsorption isotherm were performed by treating 25 ml of arsenic solution 50 100 mg l with optimized adsorbent dose and ph at different temperatures

rl values between 0 030 and 0 031 for as iii and 0 007 and 0 008 for as v imply favorable adsorption process the results of this study are in accordance with the findings obtained by other researchers

calculated by the following equation eq 9 9 e 1 2 b d the e values of 1 20 1 28 kj mol for adsorption of as iii and 2 08 5 90 kj mol for as v advocate physical adsorption the statistical prediction of best fitted isotherm model has been made on the basis of higher values of r 2 and lower values of standard error of estimation see the langmuir isotherm model provides the best fit isotherm with

10 2 g mg min for as iii and as v respectively table 4 similar results for the rate constants are reported by zhou et al 2018 for removal of arsenic from wastewater 54 the values of the correlation coefficients r 2 for the pseudo second order 0 99 0 97 are higher than pseudo first order 0 89 0 77 the standard errors of estimation see values of pseudo second order 0 25 0 973 are lower than pseudo first ones 0 99 1 45 implying that the adsorption rate is governed by pseudo second order kinetics 4 6 diffusion mechanism of adsorption the diffusion mechanism of adsorption generally involves three major rate limiting steps liquid film diffusion 55 intraparticle diffusion 56 and interior surface diffusion the liquid film and intraparticle diffusion models can be expressed as eqs 12 and 13 respectively 12 l n 1 q e q t k f t 13 q t k i p t 0 5 c i where q e q t f and kf 1 min is liquid film diffusion rate constant k ip mg g min0 5 is intraparticle diffusion rate constant and ci is intercept reflecting the thickness of boundary layer according to liquid film diffusion and weber morris models the corresponding plots of ln 1 f vs t and q t vs t 0 5 fig s7a should be straight line passing through the origin the experimental data was fitted to both the models adsorption of arsenic is supposed to be completed in three steps i external surface adsorption phase due to the external mass transfer immediate adsorption stage ii gradual adsorption phase and iii final equilibrium phase due to low arsenic concentration the graph shows that the adsorption of as iii and as v are not linear over entire time range intraparticle diffusion is involved in the second and third phase of the adsorption process the kf 1 min and r2 values for as iii and as v are 0 082 and 0 070 0 99 and 0 98 respectively the calculated values of k ip ci and r2 for as iii and as v are 1 46 1 57 mg g min0 5 30 57 61 05 and 0 89 0 93 respectively it can be concluded from figure s7b that both models control the overall adsorption mechanism as the lines do not pass through the origin in both the plots 4 7 adsorption thermodynamics the parameters such as δg o gibbs free energy change δho enthalpy change and δso entropy change are calculated to evaluate the thermodynamic feasibility spontaneity and nature of the adsorption process using gibbs equation eq 14 and van t hoff equation eq 15 14 δ g 0 δ h 0 t δ s 0 15 l o g q e c e δ s 0 2 303 r δ h 0 2 303 r t the negative values of δg o for as iii 9 2 kj mol and as v 5 0 kj mol advocate thermodynamic feasibility and spontaneity of the adsorption process however positive values of δho 16 8 and 9 7 kj mol and δso 0 0084 and 0 0047 kj mol k for as iii and as v respectively imply endothermic adsorption and increased randomness onto gpl as iii as v interface 4 8 adsorption mechanism the adsorption mechanism of arsenic species onto the gpl surface at lower ph can be explained in terms of i electrostatic interaction between positively charged surface of gelatin nh3 group lanthanum hydr oxide and or hydroxide groups of pva and ii hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl group of lanthanum oxide and pva and amine group of gelatin and oxygen atom of the arsenic species as depicted in fig 9 however at higher ph the gpl surface acquires anionic charge causing the adsorption to decrease because of interionic repulsion 4 9 adsorption desorption studies to assess the economic feasibility of gpl the recovery of arsenic and regeneration of the adsorbent was tested simultaneously a fixed amount of adsorbent 50 mg was saturated with 25 ml of arsenate arsenite solution for 50 min the adsorbent was regenerated using 0 1 m of 25 ml sodium hydroxide during desorption studies sodium hydroxide neutralizes positively charged surface of gpl which weakens the forces of attraction between the adsorbent and arsenic molecules ions after fourth adsorption desorption cycle 66 and 90 of desorption occurs for as iii and as v respectively while it adsorbs 83 as iii and 77 as v fig s8 so the gpl can be used efficiently up to four cycles for uptake of arsenic from aqueous solution 4 10 removal of arsenic spiked in water obtained from real sources in order to evaluate the efficiency of gpl composite to remove arsenic species from real wastewater samples arsenic solutions of different concentrations 50 100 mg l spiked in water from real sources having ph 7 4 has been used it is observed that under optimized conditions the percent removal decreases from 96 2 88 85 for as iii and 98 95 96 86 for as v with increasing arsenic concentrations fig s9 this study suggests that the gpl composite can be effectively used for the arsenic removal from the real wastewater samples 5 conclusions a novel gelatin pva la2o3 porous composite adsorbent is synthesized and characterized by ftir xrd bet and sem with edx the surface area of gpl composite is 53 511m² g with pore volume of 0 148 cm3 g and pore diameter of 7 158 nm the gpl is used for the removal of arsenite and arsenate from aqueous phase the maximum adsorption capacity q m is calculated to be 61 mg g for as iii and 100 mg g for as v which demonstrates greater efficiency of the composite for as v removal the adsorption data is best fitted to the langmuir isotherm suggesting monolayer adsorption of arsenic onto the gpl the rate of adsorption of arsenic onto the gpl is governed by pseudo second order kinetics the positive δho values as iii 16 8 and as v 9 7 kj mol implies endothermic adsorption process however the negative values of δg o 9 2 for as iii and 5 0 kj mol for as v advocates thermodynamic spontaneity of the adsorption process the positive δso values as iii 0 0084 and as v 0 0047 kj mol k infers increased randomness at the gpl as iii as v interface adsorption desorption cycle shows that 66 and 90 desorption occur for as iii and as v respectively in the fourth cycle indicating its economic feasibility the gpl composite can effectively

14127,water is polluted by various harmful toxic chemical substances precisely heavy metals dyes and pathogens which have a disastrous effect on the ecological balance of human as well as animal life therefore there is an urgent need for new technologies to remove these noxious pollutants from water wastewater adsorption is one of the predominant method among all the reported techniques for the removal of heavy metals nano technological applications in this direction i e development of nano sized materials tubes and composites as adsorbents have engrossed rapidly in this review current trends of nanomaterials for the removal of heavy metals from water wastewater are concisely discussed applications of different engineered nanomaterials based on iron oxide titanium oxide silica carbon graphene oxide and bio nanomaterials are largely focused different strategies and surface modifiers have been used for the surface modifications functionalization of these nanomaterials which in turn enhanced the adsorption capacities by many folds toxic effects of various nanoparticles are also discussed and various strategies like embedding encapsulation to prevent their releases into the environment are deliberated in addition the selection of nps for the removal of various metals has also been discussed in the respective sections this review will provide an insight into the latest researches which is expected to offer worthy implications to academicians and industry professionals working in environmental engineering domain for the removal of heavy metals from water wastewater keywords nanomaterials heavy metals adsorption removal nano toxicity wastewater treatment surface modification 1 introduction overpopulation industrialization and the modernization of our society lead to both the positive as well as negative impacts like economic development air water and land pollutions water pollution is of severe concern due to its adverse impacts on the living creatures as well as in the surrounding environment owing to the generation of it large quantum sources of water supply like sub surface lake and river are being depleted slowly due to global warming 1 and also contaminated 2 therefore there are pressing demands of new technologies to reuse recycle the generated wastewater for developing countries remediation and treatment of this generated wastewater are of major concern by considering the vital points like recyclability reusability cost and sustainability as the population is increasing rapidly by 2030 the indian population is expected to reach 1 51 billion which would aid in severe water scarcity typically wastewater contains organic pollutants i e detergents pesticides processed foods pharmaceuticals and inorganic pollutants i e salts and heavy metals particularly heavy metals originated from earth crust are not readily degraded or destroyed few metals like copper and zinc in limited amounts are essential for the maintenance of metabolisms in the human body however accumulation of non biodegradable heavy metals including fe cr pb as ni cd se and hg in its various oxidation states by humans and plants in higher concentrations leads to cause severe health and environmental problems 3 therefore there is an urgent need for the removal of these contaminants from wastewater to make it reusable various conventional technologies are available for their remediation such as chemical precipitation 4 membrane filtration 5 6 adsorption 7 10 ion exchange 11 photocatalysis 12 15 and coagulation and flocculation 16 17 among all these technologies adsorption onto nanomaterials is the proficient removal technique for heavy metals from wastewater as other methods do not deal effectively and their limits have reached for adequate removal 18 21 various adsorbents bare or surface modified like biopolymers 22 24 activated carbon 25 chelating minerals 26 27 engineered nanomaterials 28 31 nanofiltration 32 34 and nanocomposites 35 40 have been employed for the removal of heavy metals along with other pollutants from wastewater nanotechnology the conscious control of matter to restrict its size less than 100 nm has led to developing new materials which have certain relative unique properties that cannot be found in bulk sized materials usefulness of nanomaterials has been reported by various researchers due to their large surface area and surface free energy small size active atomicity and reactivity the high surface area to volume ratio of nanomaterials immensely improvises its sorption efficiency further surface modification is a powerful tool which improvises the properties of a material through imparting the desired functional groups on its surface without compromising with the bulk properties 41 46 surface modification of nanomaterials by forming various functional groups i e amine nh2 carboxylic cooh thiol sh and methyl on their surfaces have been explored and resulted in enhanced performances 40 47 these features led to the vast applications of engineering nanomaterials 48 55 extensive efforts have been dedicated to nanomaterials for the wastewater treatment various nanomaterials like nanorods 56 58 nano spheres 59 60 and nanotubes 61 64 have been explored for the removal of heavy metals however nanomaterials also have certain limitations i e high cost 65 poor efficiency of recycling and toxicity therefore some low cost adsorbents have also been scrutinized such as rice husk 66 sawdust 67 sugarcane bagasse 68 and orange peel 69 although adsorption is one of the proficient technique because of its low cost and ease of availability of wide range of adsorbents however various bottlenecks are yet to be addressed to achieve a reputed status in the commercial sectors the present review mainly emphases on nanomaterials for the removal of heavy metals e g as iii pb ii hg ii cr iv cd ii and ni ii from the aqueous solution tap water and industrial wastewater salient features of the emerging nanomaterials like their constituents characteristics modes of action and removal efficiencies are thoroughly discussed and highlighted surface modification strategies of nanoparticles nps and their applications towards the removal of heavy metals are discussed in relevant sections to highlight its significance also the principal mechanism of heavy metals sorption is highlighted examples of some promising nps and nanocomposites are discussed including iron oxide titanium oxide carbon silica graphene oxide and bio nanomaterials nps of cuo tio2 agnps and zno and their toxicity levels after their release into the environment were also discussed in individual sections four comprehensive tables listing various nanomaterials their adsorption capacities and optimal conditions are also supplemented for the better understanding to readers 2 carbon nanotubes carbon has the ability to form carbon to carbon long chains due to its binding capability in both straight and complex branching s which enables double or triple bond formation and collection of atoms in different geometrical arrangements 70 carbon nanomaterials have been widely used for the removal of heavy metals due to their high sorption capacities and non toxicity 71 72 recent studies also revealed an increasing trend in the application of carbon based nanomaterials for wastewater treatment 73 75 the discovery of carbon structures by iijima in 1991 established high potential of carbon nanotubes cnts for the removal of heavy metals 76 77 cnts have commonly been fabricated by chemical vapor deposition cvd method cnts are further divided into single walled cnts swcnts and multi walled cnts mwcnts having a length of several 100 1000 nm and width of 1 3 nm 78 however the low adsorption capacity of cnts demands its surface functionalization functional groups such as cooh nh2 and oh have been tested for the surface modification of cnts through chemical routes which immensely improved their adsorption capacities 79 80 the mechanism of heavy metal s removal by cnts is very complicated and comprised of electrostatic interactions ligand exchange surface complexes formation and sorption precipitation between the metallic ion species and functional groups attached over cnts surface 81 this leads to the applications based functionalization of cnts for the removal of heavy metals few examples of the carbon nanostructured materials with and without surface functionalization are discussed below and summarized in table 1 typically mwcnts are found to have higher adsorption capacity than cnts for a given adsorbate 2 1 non functionalized carbon nanotubes various pristine carbon based one dimensional nanomaterials have been utilized for the metal removal high surface area to volume ratio has been found as a key factor for their high adsorption capacity in this context mwcnts synthesized by cvd technique and having a width in the range of 60 70 nm and length in microns removed 100 cd ii at a dosage of 0 5 mg ml from 100 ppm metallic solution at ph 10 and 12 respectively the interaction of mwcnts with cadmium ions was achieved by the ultrasonic environment which resulted in the maximum adsorption capacity qm value of 181 81 mg g of mwcnts as per langmuir isotherm 88 yet the adsorption was achieved within 90 s however the removal of metal ions in the presence of ultrasonic waves challenges its practical applicability at a larger scale various studies have been performed without the use of any external energy for example mwcnts synthesized by tubular microwave cvd technique and having a length of 10 microns and diameter ranging from 13 to 20 nm removed 98 and 99 99 of cd ii 89 and zn ii 90 respectively from 10 ppm individual metallic solutions the cd ii removal was occurred at ph 5 within 50 min and dosage of 1 mg ml while zn ii at ph 10 within 60 min and dosage 0 2 mg ml the qm values of mwcnts for cd ii and zn ii removal as per langmuir isotherm were found to be 88 62 and 90 9 mg g respectively this explains that not only the no of layers but also the width of the cnts also plays a crucial role in the metal adsorption the discussed examples explained that at lower dimensions cnts do not require any external energy source for the adsorption of the heavy metals mwcnts synthesized by the above technique and having diameter ranging from 15 to 23 nm removed 99 and 99 9 of cu ii 91 and pb ii 92 respectively from 10 ppm of individual metallic solutions within 35 and 22 5 min the removal of cu ii and pb ii was optimized at ph 5 5 and dosage of 0 4 mg ml the qm values of mwcnts as per langmuir isotherm for cu ii and pb ii removal were found to be 99 and 104 2 mg g respectively also in a separate study cnts synthesized by two stage cvd technique having diameter ranging from 30 to 33 nm removed 83 of cr vi from 1 ppm of metallic solution within 120 min at ph 9 and dosage of 9 mg ml the qm value of cnts for cr vi removal as per langmuir isotherm was 2 49 mg g 93 these studies suggest that an average width of 15 to 25 nm provides the required surface area for the effective removal of heavy metals from the bulk in addition the role of the ph can also be explained in the removal of heavy metals the removal of heavy metals is quicker at acidic ph due to the adsorption in form of ions as the main species however at basic ph these metals form hydroxides and get precipitated with higher efficiency although basic ph requires longer time duration which can be tuned by reducing the width of cnts by choosing a suitable oxidizing agent during the synthesis process 88 94 although the mwcnts have been proven efficient in the removal of heavy metals yet their efficacy and time required for the removal of heavy metals depend on the ph of the reaction this lag can be overcome by the surface functionalization via altering the surface charge of the functional bodies of the mwcnts 2 2 functionalized carbon nanotubes although non functionalized carbon nanomaterials provide sufficient adsorption capacity yet their reusability and selectivity for heavy metal s have been a great challenge for the environmental engineers hence researchers are focusing on the functionalization of these carbon nanomaterials to address the above mentioned limitations novel carbon microspheres cms prepared by hydrothermal carbonization of xylose obtained from agricultural waste and functionalized with boronic acid having a spherical shape of about 20 nm have been tested for the removal of cr vi ni ii and cu ii the functionalization enhanced the surface area from 26 1 to 76 1 m2 g and pore volume from 0 043 to 0 176 cm3 g the surface charge of cms functionalized with boronic acid decreased from 7 mv to 37 mv in the ph range of 2 to 10 resulting in the formation of the tetrahedral anion from neutral trigonal of cms which enabled better adsorption of metallic ions through electrostatic interactions the qm values for cu ii cr vi and ni ii removal were found to be 183 38 mg g 175 67 mg g and 205 7 mg g at ph of 3 2 and 7 respectively and were retained more than 75 up to three adsorption cycles hence the functionalization of cms can enhance the surface area and pore volume by 3 to 4 folds for the better adsorption of the metal ions 95 another group 96 prepared a biocompatible sorbent by condensation of fructose and modification by porphyrin which was found to have an enormous surface area of 289 m2 g and an average pore diameter of 8 nm these carbon nanostructures were found to efficiently remove fe iii ni ii cd ii and cu ii from 5 ppm of metallic solutions at a ph of 7 during column studies in the flow rate of 3 0 21 0 ml min the qm values for cd ii cu ii ni ii and fe iii removal were 81 6 48 3 41 4 and 53 6 mg g respectively the removal efficiencies of the prepared nanostructure from a real wastewater sample of a plating industry were found to be about 99 98 97 and 96 for cd ii cu ii ni ii and fe iii respectively polyethyleneimine multiwalled carbon nanotube polymeric nanocomposite pei mwcnts were prepared from functionalized mwcnts as shown in fig 1 nh2 groups of branched pei were linked with cooh groups of f mwcnts in the presence of sodium hydroxide naoh and epichlorohydrin at 65 c to prepare the nanocomposite the synthesized pei mwcnts with an average diameter of 25 nm pore volume of 2 10 3 cm3 g and surface area of 1 70 m2 g removed 99 of cr vi from 10 ppm metallic solution at a dosage of 2 mg ml within 60 min and ph 4 the qm value for cr vi removal was 40 mg g this prepared nano composite was reused 5 times by losing only 20 of its adsorption efficiency 97 another group reported 98 that coating of polydopamine pda and functionalization of pei over cnts enhanced its adsorption capacity towards cu ii removal the cnts were coated with pda in alkaline medium through mussel chemistry and further peis were conjugated on cnts pda surface to form cnts pda pei via michael addition reaction as shown in fig 2 the qm value of the prepared adsorbent for the cu ii removal was reported to be 70 9 mg g at 292 k recently hayati et al 99 reported super high removal adsorption capacities of tubular shape cnts modified with poly amidoamine dendrimer pamam g4 these modified cnts of diameter 10 30 nm removed pb ii and cu ii from 100 ppm binary solutions at ph 7 with a dosage of 0 03 mg ml nh2 binding sites on the surface of pamam chelated the metal ions by coordinating one metal ion which led to the transfer of nh2 charge over the metal surface and in turn offered huge adsorption capacity the qm values for pb ii and cu ii removal were found to be 4870 and 3333 mg g respectively the surface area occupied per mol of pb ii and cu ii on the cnts were reported to be 43 734 and 18 618 m2 respectively the abundance of amide groups over pamam structure was solely responsible for the high metal adsorption through coordination and chelation magnetic carbon nanomaterials are also prepared and explored for the removal of heavy metals mwcnts were doped with zero valent iron particles fe0 in a cvd reactor to form a magnetic fe mwcnts the prepared magnetic fe mwcnts removed 74 and 77 of as iii and as v within 60 min from 10 ppm of the individual metallic solutions at ph 6 7 and dosage of 0 2 g l fe0 tends to oxidize in water solution and forms fe2 and fe3 hydroxides which then formed complexes with arsenic species and removal of arsenic ions took place the qm values for as iii and as v removal as per langmuir isotherm were found to be 200 and 250 mg g respectively 100 in another study 101 comparison between adsorption efficiency of magnetic biochar mbc and mwcnts functionalized with carboxyl and methyl groups was investigated the mwcnts and mbc removed 93 and 85 of sn ii within 90 min from 0 1 ppm metallic solution at a ph of 5 and dosage of 1 mg ml a higher qm value of 0 459 mg g for mwcnts was observed than that 0 344 mg g for mbc also mwcnts were oxidized with hno3 and kmno4 to generate functional groups and found to have better qm values for cd ii removal than mbc i e 83 33 and 62 5 mg g respectively the mwcnts and mbc removed 90 and 80 of cd ii within 90 min from 10 ppm metallic solution at ph 5 and dosage of 1 mg ml 102 these observations explain that the functionalization enhances the surface properties such as surface area pore volume and surface charge 95 which in turn affects the adsorption of heavy metals even at acidic ph within a shorter duration as discussed in section 2 1 the acidic ph provides quick removal of metal ions but its efficiency remains low due to the direct adsorption of metals in their respective ionic forms the surface functionalization alters the surface charge and facilitates a quicker adsorption with a higher efficiency and thus removes the lag of non functionalization for the removal of most of the divalent metal ions nh2 functionalization is found to be more efficient at neutral ph due to the enhanced zeta potential and surface area although the huge adsorption capacity of metals from water wastewater through cnts has many benefits but there are few aspects which need to be resolved for example the development of cost effective cnts to increase their commercial use has been an obstacle in addition the recycle reuse of cnts from water wastewater after adsorption of toxic metals is difficult which would increase the risk of secondary pollution hence the development of new materials or modification of the existing materials with high adsorption capacity is required which can serve for the effective removal of toxic metals with the ease of separation and reusability 3 graphene nanomaterials graphene has a honeycomb network structure and was extracted from graphite and it also possesses good mechanical properties electrical properties and thermal conductivity 103 it was available in many forms such as graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide r go and also used for the removal of heavy metals from water wastewater go is the oxidative product of graphene prepared by modified hummers method mhm which contains a variety of oxygen functional group i e carbonyl and epoxy groups 104 while r go is the reduction product of go having more structural defects than graphene but can be easily modified by functional groups such as oh nh2 and cooh ahmed et al 105 reported 95 removal of zn ii by using go nanosheets from the effluent of electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor the removal was optimized at ph of 6 3 initial zn ii concentration of 0 4 ppm and dosage of 1 by weight the removal mechanism of zn ii removal was electrostatic interactions between the metal ions and go nanosheets due to the presence of oxygen containing functional groups such as epoxy and oh on go basal plane the qm value of the go nanosheet for zn ii removal was found to be 243 9 mg g as per langmuir isotherm another group reported that nano adsorbents nano sheets of go with magnetic iron nps 10 nm assembled on polystyrene having zeta potential of 16 mv thickness of 1 2 nm and surface area of 28 15 m2 g removed 90 of pb ii at a dosage of 2 mg l and ph of 6 within 8 h from 10 ppm of metallic solution removal of pb ii ions occurred through electrostatic interactions between the electronegative oxygen of nano adsorbent and positive pb ii ions in the aqueous solution which was confirmed by ftir results i e peak shift and decrease in the intensity of co and co of nano adsorbent the qm value of the prepared nano sheets was 73 52 mg g and 60 removal efficiency remained after 4 cycles of recycling 111 graphene oxide and iron manganese go fe mn composite having average bet surface area pore diameter and total pore volume of 153 43 m2 g 2 46 nm and 0 095 cm3 g respectively was first time investigated for the removal of hg ii the presence of oxygen containing functional groups i e co coc o co and co on go fe mn composite enhanced removal efficiency of hg ii from 75 to 89 as compared to fe mn composite from 1 ppm of metallic solution the qm value of the composite was 32 95 2 64 mg g as predicted by sips model fe mn oxides on the surface of graphene oxide shown in fig 3 adsorbed hg ii and facilitated the removal of mercury from metallic solution through ligand exchange between surface oh groups of go fe mn and hg oh 2 and a surface complexation model 106 go can also be easily modified by adding a variety of functional groups to improve its adsorption behavior 109 110 for example gos were combined with fe3o4 nps and functionalized with the different amounts 1 0 2 0 and 5 0 g of polydimethyldiallyl pmdaac denoted as pmdaac 1 0 pmdaac 2 0 and pmdaac 5 0 to enhance the adsorption process by its long chain of carbon atoms go functionalized with pmdaac 2 0 pmgo 2 removed 99 of cr vi from 70 ppm metallic solution at a ph of 4 5 and a dosage of 2 g l the qm value of pmgo 2 was 95 2 mg g 108 another group 107 synthesized go based inverse spinel nickel ferrite gonf nanocomposite by chemical co precipitation method the gonf having dark and shiny morphology shown in fig 3 triangular shape with surface area of 136 m2 g and average particle size of 37 25 nm removed 99 6 and 93 of cr iii and pb ii respectively from 10 ppm of metallic solutions at a dosage of 0 75 and 0 5 g l within 120 min at ph of 6 chemisorption of metal ions on surfaces of gonf exhibited different surface morphologies as compared to bare ones as shown in fig 4 the qm values of the nanocomposite were reported to be 64 10 mg g and 46 08 mg g for cr iii and pb ii respectively as per langmuir isotherm and nanocomposite was reused up to 3 cycles by losing only 5 of its efficiency table 2 lists go and rgo based adsorbents along with their methods of preparation optimal conditions and adsorption capacities for various heavy metals the go prepared by the direct oxidation of graphite using k2cr2o7 have shown the highest qm value for pb ii presumably due to its high content of cooh groups 109 as compared to go prepared by other modified hummers methods also thiol functionalized rgo was found to be a novel adsorbent for hg ii removal high specific surface area and good chemical constancy of r go make it suitable for the water wastewater treatment 105 106 stannic oxide quantum dots decorated r go nanocomposite removed 99 97 and 98 of pb ii hg ii and cd ii from 5 ppm of individual metallic solutions at a dosage of 0 5 mg ml within 1 h the qm value of r go nanocomposite for pb ii removal was 18 58 mg g 119 silver nps and rgo based mesoporous manganese oxide nanocomposite ag nps meso r go having flaky pastry like morphology with a pore radius of 1 3 nm and surface area of 54 m2 g removed 68 of cr vi at a dosage of 6 66 mg ml from 50 ppm of the metallic solution removal of cr vi ions was facilitated through electrostatic interactions between the surface of metal oxides nanocomposites ag nps r go and chromium anions the qm value for cr vi removal was 140 mg g 120 all these studies together suggest that the mechanism of heavy metals removal through graphene based nanomaterials is based upon surface metal hydroxide precipitation and electrostatic interactions this interaction depends on the surface area as well as the surface charge more is the surface area higher is the adsorption capacity 120 which directly depends upon the specifically tunable morphology of the go based nanomaterials however the study of these nanomaterials towards industrial application still needs to be explored specifically for the real wastewater treatment which consists a mixture of pollutants the reuse and recyclability of graphene based nanomaterials also need to be further investigated from an economic point of view 121 in case of go the functionalization via metal oxides largely enhances the electronegative charge over the go enhancing the removal efficiency of the gos however functionalization with organic charged group is still required to be explored for its practical applications the benefit of using the organic charged groups remains in the selection of length and the density of the side chain which may provide stable higher charge as well as the required surface area for the higher removal efficiency at the neutral ph 4 silica nanomaterials the three dimensional network structure of silica sio2 122 makes it porous and provides good mechanical strength and a large surface area thermal stability and water stability which provides easier access to metal ions to reach the inner surface at a higher reaction rate 123 the presence of silanol group sioh on the surface of the silica nanomaterials acts as a chelating agent for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants from water wastewater 124 in a recent study by ahmed et al 105 it was found that 99 5 of zn ii was removed by using sio2 nps from the effluent of electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor the removal was occurred in 4 h at a ph of 8 2 initial zn ii concentration of 0 4 ppm and dosage of 2 wt the qm of sio2 nps for zn ii removal was found to be 9 1 mg g as per langmuir isotherm silica nps their composites and surface functionalized silica have been explored for the heavy metals removal 125 various approaches to modify the silica surfaces have been reported to enhance its adsorption capacity silica nps were modified with different functional groups i e nh2 phosphonate poly ethylene glycol cooh sh nh2 octadecyl and carboxylate octadecyl groups to reduce their aggregation and enhancing adsorption efficiency and some of the recent examples are listed in table 3 the nh2 functionalized silica particles were best suitable for the removal of divalent metal cations the sh functionalization was found to be proficient for the hg ii removal although silica nps provide higher adsorption capacity due to their above discussed surface properties yet its commercial applications are restricted because of their tendency to aggregate in the aqueous solution in this context bagwe et al functionalized silica nps with nh2 groups in order to reduce the aggregation as shown in fig 5 and achieved higher removal efficiency as well as controlled the non specific binding of the metal ions 126 various surface modifiers have been used to modify the surface of silica particles to chelate the metal ions from aqueous solution and tap water for example nh2 functionalized mesoporous silica having an average pore size of 4 39 nm and surface of 395 m2 g removed 67 99 5 82 and 99 8 of zn ii cu ii cd ii and pb ii respectively from 1 0 mm individual metallic solutions at ph of 5 07 and dosage of 1 mg ml the nh2 groups over the adsorbent surface formed the coordination bond with heavy metal ions which enabled their effective removal the qm values for removal zn ii cu ii cd ii and pb ii were reported to be 111 8 mg g 181 74 mg g 152 87 mg g and 484 84 mg g respectively 133 in brief mesoporous and nanoporous silica nps provide higher qm values for di valent metal ions such as cd ii but the nh2 functionalization further enhanced the qm values by 2 to 3 folds as extracted from the above examples this provides an opportunity to the environmental material engineers to tune the silica based nanocomposites for their site as well as target specific applications in the metal removal a separate study by vojoudi et al revealed that mercaptoamine functionalized silica coated magnetic nps maf scmnps having a size of 13 6 nm and surface area of 71 9 m2 g adsorbed pb ii and hg ii at a dosage of 0 4 and 0 2 mg ml and ph of 6 5 and 5 5 respectively from 50 ppm individual metallic solutions the maf scmnps interacted more efficiently with the metal ions due to the multiple numbers of nh2 and sulfur adsorption sites over its surface the removal occurred through the exchange of ions between sh functional groups present on the nano adsorbent surface and heavy metal ions and the modified nps retained 93 adsorption efficiency after 5 cycles of adsorption desorption the qm values of maf scmnps for the removal of pb ii and hg ii were reported to be 292 and 355 mg g respectively 134 also nanoporous sba 15 were modified with bis 3 triethoxysilylpropyl tetrasulfide for the enhancement of the surface area to increase the adsorption efficiency the modified sba 15 adsorbent 100 nm with pore size of 4 6 nm and surface area of 377 m2 g removed 95 6 and 96 2 of as iii ions from tap water and lake water respectively from 25 ppm of spiked metallic concentrations at ph 8 within 30 min and dosage of 1 2 mg ml the qm value for as iii removal was 322 6 mg g 135 in addition the composites of silica based nanomaterials have also been studied for the removal of toxic metals in a study mesoporous silica calcium phosphate synthesized by one pot method with a surface area of 314 56 m2 g particle size of about 20 nm and bimodal pore distribution of 3 82 nm and 12 4 nm removed 99 65 of cd ii at ph of 6 within 30 min and dosage of 2 5 g l from 100 ppm of metallic solution the qm value for cd ii removal was 125 63 mg g and only about 20 removal efficiency was reduced after 3 removal cycles 136 in another study nanocomposites of nanosilica and nanopolyaniline sil phy npani having a size in the range of 7 14 23 91 nm were found to remove cd ii pb ii hg ii and cu ii from seawater industrial wastewater and drinking tap water samples nanopolyaniline had abundance of nh2 and imine functional groups over its surface which interacted with the metal ions and enhanced the adsorption efficiency adsorption experiments were performed using a micro pack column at a flow rate of 10 ml min and adsorbent dosage of 0 1 mg ml the binding of metal ions m ii with sil phy npani nanocomposite through electrostatic interactions as shown in fig 6 the functional groups responsible for binding with heavy metal ions with the composite were nh2 groups of polyaniline and oh groups of silica the qm values for cd ii pb ii hg ii and cu ii were reported to be 136 98 1428 6 256 4 and 1000 mg g respectively 137 the high surface area porosity and the presence of sioh over silica based nanomaterials make them efficient adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals however their aggregation in the aqueous solution is still a major concern which can be reduced by a surface modification to quite some extent sioh enables easy functionalization through crosslinking hence more research is required for the practical applicability of silica based materials for the removal of heavy metals the nh2 functionalization has been proven to provide excellent chelating ability to the silica based nps and was found to remove various heavy metals with higher efficiency i e higher removal at lower dosage near to the neutral ph this enables the real time application of functionalized silica based nps for the treatment of the water wastewater in addition removal of higher valent metals pentavalent or more using sio2 nanomaterials is also required to be explored which can be assisted via coupling it with the other organic systems 5 iron oxide based nanomaterials iron fe oxide nps have a large prospective for the environmental remediation for a wide range of contaminants due to their low cost ease of manufacture and modification nano ranged iron oxides have a high surface area to volume ratio superparamagnetism low toxicity chemical inertness and biocompatibility 138 and can easily immobilize other adsorbents over its surface for the enhanced activities fe based nanomaterials have been explored in many morphologies such as nps nano ovals nanobelts and nanorings 139 142 as well as its composite with graphene based materials for heavy metal removal as discussed in section 3 metal removal through adsorption on iron oxide nps in aqueous solution leads to the aggregation of nps and competitive adsorption from other adsorbates these large aggregates thus formed in the aqueous solution alter their magnetic properties as well as remove different inorganic and organic pollutants from water wastewater this non dispersion ability of iron nps in aqueous solution can be reduced by synthesis optimization reducing surface energy and surface modification methods 143 surface modifications by attaching different organic molecules inorganic shells for preventing fe nps oxidation have been explored 144 147 functional groups like cooh and nh2 groups are found to increase their stability adsorption efficiency and surface area for chelating metal ions from water wastewater 148 recently nh2 functionalized fe3o4 nh2 nps were formed with the enhanced surface area due to the grafting of amino groups over its surface these prepared fe3o4 nh2 nps removed 97 94 cr vi and 98 56 ni ii from 1 ppm metallic tap water at ph 6 6 the qm values for the cr vi and ni ii removal as per langmuir isotherm were reported to be 222 12 and 232 15 mg g respectively 149 in a distinct study it was concluded that nh2 functionalized fe3o4 sio2 nh2 showed good solvent dispersion ability and magnetic property the prepared fe3o4 sio2 nh2 nps have optimal removal of zn ii from pickling waste at ph of 5 0 and dosage of 0 5 mg ml from 100 ppm metallic solution the qm value for zn ii removal was 169 5 mg g 150 reaction 1 shows the removal of zinc by attaching to the nh2 functionalized mnps in another study 151 it was revealed that magnesium ferrite mgfe2o4 nps functionalized with nh2 were found to have higher adsorption capacity than fe3o4 nh2 these mgfe2o4 nh2 nps removed 99 pb ii from 15 ppm metallic solution at ph 4 the large surface area of 56 5 m2 g for mgfe2o4 nh2 nps arose from the cluster formation of porous mgfe2o4 in the aqueous solution the qm values for pb ii removal was 135 1 mg g in addition 152 fe3o4 nh2 nps exhibited the excellent rapid chelating properties for both metal cations and anions and optimally removed of cu ii and cr iv from 600 ppm individual metallic solutions at ph 5 and 6 respectively the qm values for cu ii and cr iv removal as per langmuir isotherm were reported to be 12 43 and 11 24 mg g respectively the nh2 functionalization as scrutinized in above examples elucidates that nh2 functionalization incorporates high surface area and alters the surface charge over the fe based nps to enhance their adsorption capacity in addition as discussed in section 4 nh2 functionalization reduces the aggregation of nps which in turn enhances the applicability as well as the reusability of the inorganic nanoparticles 1 organic polymers like poly γ glutamic acid γ pga coated magnetic nps removed 99 24 99 63 77 17 and 99 63 of cr iii cu ii ni ii and pb ii at a dosage of 80 mg ml from 50 ppm metallic solutions respectively the flocculating nature of γ pga resulted in the metal ions to bind over it and also stabilized the magnetic nps in the aqueous solution the qm value of nps for cr iii removal was 24 60 mg g 153 also the coating of fe3o4 nps by humic acid ha was found to enhance the stability of nps by preventing the aggregation of nps these coated nps fe3o4 ha removed 99 and 95 of hg ii and pb ii from 0 1 ppm aqueous solution respectively the optimum dosage and ph for the removal were 0 1 mg ml and 6 respectively the qm values for hg ii and pb ii as per langmuir isotherm were found to be 92 4 and 97 7 mg g respectively 154 all the three forms of fe oxide have been investigated for water wastewater treatment applications i e magnetite fe3o4 maghemite γ fe2o3 and hematite α fe2o3 155 156 which are discussed in the following sections various iron oxide based nanomaterials as adsorbent optimal conditions and their adsorption capacities for various heavy metals are summarized in table 4 as revealed from table surface functional groups were participated in the chelation removal of toxic metal ions these groups also facilitated easy desorption as a function of ph and thus imparted reusability rhodanine attached over maghemite nps exhibited a large adsorption capacity of hg ii due to the presence of sulfur groups 5 1 magnetite fe3o4 nps fe3o4 nps are not stable in the aqueous environment due to their high surface energy 164 however their stability was enhanced by various organic inorganic supports which are deliberated below and some of them are discussed in table 4 various surfactants have been coated on fe3o4 nps to overcome agglomeration in the aqueous solution like fe3o4 nps coated with an anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate removed 15 0 98 1 and 89 3 of cu ii ni ii and zn ii respectively at ph 6 within 1 min and dosage of 0 75 mg ml from industrial wastewater the qm values for cu ii ni ii and zn ii removal were found to be 24 3 41 2 and 59 2 mg g respectively and reused 5 times without considerably losing its removal efficiency 165 a cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide 166 was also used to cap fe3o4 nps through the electrostatic interaction oh nh4 between surface oh groups of fe3o4 and the ammonium groups in ctab fig 7 these modified nps showed enhanced removal 95 77 of cr vi at ph 4 and dosage of 12 mg ml from 100 ppm metallic solution as compared to uncapped nps 74 49 cr vi adhered to the ammonium functional groups present on the surface and was reduced to insoluble cr iii hydroxide as shown in fig 7 in another study 167 fe3o4 nps synthesized with tetramethylammonium hydroxide having spherical particles of 15 30 nm with surface area of 12 7 m2 g removed 58 4 of cr vi and 100 of pb ii at ph of 2 and 5 in 20 ppm and 10 ppm of chromium and lead solutions respectively at a dosage of 1 0 g l the qm values for cr vi and pb ii removal were found to be 34 9 mg g and 53 1 mg g respectively and the adsorbent was effectively reused twice surface functionalization not only provides the stability to the magnetic nps for its reusability but also enhances its removal efficiency for example wang et al revealed that organic polymers like poly glycidyl methacrylate when coated on fe3o4 nps through radical polymerization and linked by β cyclodextrin having spherical morphology removed 79 5 of cu ii in 24 h from 45 ppm metallic solution at a dosage of 0 4 mg ml 168 mollahosseini et al 169 coated fe3o4 nps with polypyrrole ppy through oxidative polymerization for the removal of al iii from the aqueous solution the prepared ppy fe3o4 composite with a spherical diameter ranging from 30 to 150 nm removed al iii within 20 min at a ph of 3 dosage of 100 μg ml and 5 μg ml of initial metal concentration the qm value of ppy fe3o4 composite for al iii removal was reported to be 270 27 mg g as per langmuir isother and were reused 5 times by losing 32 7 of its removal efficiency in another study by singh et al 170 reported 96 of cd ii removal by using citric acid cac coated fe3o4 nps from 25 ppm of aqueous solution the adsorption of cd ii on cac fe3o4 nps took place at ph of 5 temperature 35 c and contact time of 60 min the prepared adsorbent showed 99 8 desorption of cd ii in 0 2 m hcl solution and was experienced for eight times desorption the qm value of cac fe3o4 nps for cd ii removal at 308 k was found to be 12 56 mg g as per langmuir isotherm also silane coupling agents were used to increase nps stability and zeta potential it was reported that fe3o4 nps fabricated on halloysite nanotubes hnt surfaces and modified by 3 piperazinepropylmethyldi methoxysilane kh 108 and anilino methyl triethoxysilane kh 42 removed 81 35 cr vi and 50 sb v at ph of 3 and 100 cr vi and 98 8 sb v at ph of 2 from 20 ppm binary metallic solutions the zeta potential of both kh 108 and kh 42 modified nps varies from 10 to 38 mv in the ph range of 2 10 the qm values of kh 108 modified nps for sb v and cr vi removal as per langmuir isotherm were reported to be 30 49 and 59 90 mg g at 308 k respectively 171 biopolymer like chitosan was also convoluted for preparation of fe3o4 chitosan nanocomposites on the basis of nh2 and oh functional groups present on chitosan for example fe3o4 nps capped with p sulfonatodansylcalix 4 arene and chitosan composite having the spherical shape of size 17 nm and pore size of 0 19 nm were found to remove hg ii from 0 35 ppm metallic solution at a dosage of 10 mg ml the qm value for hg ii removal was 86 65 mg g 172 wang et al 173 prepared mussel inspired fe3o4 nps with pda and additionally cross linked with cs to form the nanoadsorbent pda cs fe3o4 for the removal of hg ii pb ii and cr vi the qm values for hg ii cr vi and pb ii were found to be 256 152 and 47 mg g respectively the synthesized nano absorbent retained its adsorption efficiency upto four adsorption desorption cycles in another study 174 aminated fe3o4 nps having an average size of 50 nm were filled into chitosan polyvinyl alcohol nanofibres to form a nonporous membrane over polyethersulfone the synthesized membrane of 60 5 μm thickness was found to have optimal removal of cr vi and pb ii at ph of 6 and 2 from 20 ppm individual metallic solutions with an adsorbent dosage of 0 5 mg l respectively at lower ph value electrostatic interaction occurred between the nh2 and oh groups present on the nanofibrous membrane and chromium anions i e cr2o7 2 and hcro4 while for the lead removal an extra number of active sites were available on the nanofibrous membrane due to the presence of oh groups the qm values for lead and chromium removal were found to be 509 7 and 525 8 mg g respectively organic groups present in the natural resources were also used to modify magnetite nps for example sebastian et al used phenolic groups present in the husk of coconut shell to fabricate onto fe3o4 np and resulted in the effective adsorption of ca and cd from the aqueous medium at ph of 6 and temperature of 40 c with a dosage of 3 6 to 4 0 mg ml the separation of metal ions was due to the presence of cooh group fabricated on the fe3o4 nps from coconut husk which contains benzoic and caffeic acids the qm values for cd and ca removal were reported to be 9 6 and 13 7 mg g respectively 175 the presence of a nitrogen atmosphere during magnetite nps synthesis also contributed to increasing its removal efficiency in this direction wang et al synthesized fe3o4 nps by co precipitation method through nitrogen passing denoted as ncm and without nitrogen passing cm and removed 80 56 and 42 37 for ncm and 48 06 and 25 91 for cm of pb ii and cr iii respectively from 20 ppm metallic solutions at a dosage of 4 mg ml within 180 min nps were quasi spherical shaped with an average diameter of 15 nm and surface area of 125 77 m2 g for ncm was enhanced as compared to cm 107 55 m2 g the qm values for pb ii and cr iii removal by ncm were found to be 3 44 and 2 77 mg g at 293 k respectively 176 these studies together confirm that fe3o4 and its composite are efficacious in the removal of hexavalent than that of divalent or trivalent heavy metals however successful coupling with organic compounds may enhance the removal capacity of divalent heavy metals as well coupling with organic compounds enhances the solubility of fe3o4 in the aqueous media which in turn enhances the adsorption behavior of the fe3o4 and its compounds in addition it was found that the surface modification via nh2 and other positive ions enhanced the dispersion stability as well as the removal efficiency of fe3o4 nps via many folds close to the neutral ph on the other hand negatively charged surface modification acid based enabled efficient removal of heavy metals at higher dosage and lower heavy metal concentrations hence nh2 functionalization has been proven to be more efficient for the removal of higher valent metal ions 5 2 maghemite γ fe2o3 nps maghemite nps are more stable in the aqueous medium than magnetite and show ferromagnetic behavior maghemite nps are synthesized using various techniques like cvd 177 co precipitation 178 flame spray pyrolysis 179 sol gel method 180 hydrothermal method 181 and microemulsions 182 in a study maghemite nps synthesized by cvd technique using green vitriol and pyrite byproduct from titanium dioxide production having cubical shape with surface area pore volume average diameter and pore size of 14 63 m2 g 0 068 cm3 g 35 nm and 11 6 nm respectively removed 92 52 as iii at ph of 11 with dosage of 3 mg ml from 10 ppm metallic solution the qm value for as iii removal as per langmuir isotherm was 14 4 mg g at 328 15 k 177 also rajput et al fabricated maghemite nps onto glass fiber filters by flame spray pyrolysis technique the nps having hexagonal platelet size surface area the pore diameter of 3 6 to 15 7 nm 79 4 m2 g and 9 1 nm respectively were found to remove 59 2 pb ii and 25 cu ii at ph of 5 and dosage of 0 1 g l from 10 ppm metallic solutions the qm values for cu ii and pb ii removal as per langmuir isotherm were found to be 34 0 mg g at 218 k and 68 9 mg g at 318 k respectively 179 functionalization of these nps makes them more stable and also improves their metal removal efficiency like maghemite nps functionalized with glycine having spherical shape of 10 5 nm and surface area of 175 m2 g were found to have highly efficient removal of 98 cu ii at ph of 6 5 and dosage of 0 15 mg ml within 60 min from 10 ppm of metallic solution the qm value of cu ii removal was enhanced to 625 mg g 183 seraj et al coated the maghemite nps with pr and found to have a size of 10 nm particle size which removed 70 of cr vi at ph of 2 5 and dosage of 10 g l from 80 ppm metallic solution the qm value of synthesized nanoparticle was 25 85 mg g and was stable enough to reused up to 3 cycles 184 in summary maghemite and its compounds are more soluble in aqueous media however their lesser magnetic properties and agglomeration cause trouble in the separation as compared to the magnetite in addition maghemite nps are usually utilized for the removal of divalent heavy metals than that of pentavalent or more not many studies have been found for the functionalization of maghemite nps and the removal efficiency is directly dependent on the morphology of the maghemite nps controlling of morphology requires higher energy inputs which enhances the overall cost of the product for real time applications however modification with positively charged functional groups seems to be promising for enhancing the removal efficiency and maybe reconnoitered to verify the removal ability for lower to higher valent ions 5 3 hematite α fe2o3 nps hematite nps are the most stable in aqueous solution than magnetite and maghemite and show antiferromagnetic behavior hematite nps are synthesized using various substrates like silica 185 186 alginate 187 188 cs 189 and used for water treatment purposes hematite bagasse nanocomposites synthesized in the range of 50 100 nm were found to remove pb ii at ph of 5 0 and dosage of 2 mg ml in 30 ppm lead solution the binding energy and gibbs free energy of adsorption process were found to be 135 7 ev and 39 73 to 50 72 kj mol respectively which indicate spontaneous adsorption of pb ii on nanocomposites surface the qm value of the nanocomposite was 16 57 mg g at 298 15 k 190 another group 191 reported that low cost hematite nps coated with volcanic rock having pore volume and bet surface area of 5 63 10 3 cm3 g and 1 87 m2 g respectively removed 99 5 of cd ii from 100 ppm metallic solution through film and inter particle diffusion at a ph of 6 0 and dosage of 1 mg ml the qm value of hematite nps was 158 48 mg g at 313 k hematite nps as a photocatalyst also have very good efficiency for metal removal in water recently wang et al revealed that oh α fe2o3 nps synthesized by solvothermal method with an average particle size in range of 11 27 nm were found to remove cr vi in 20 ppm metallic solution at a dosage of 0 5 mg ml under photocatalytic activity and enhance removal efficiency from 24 8 to 70 2 due to synergetic effect 192 also chen et al reported that nano hematite as a photocatalyst having granular shape with an average particle size and surface area of 75 nm and 24 82 m2 g respectively were found to have optimal removal of cu ii at ph of 5 2 0 1 temperature of 298 k and dosage of 0 3 mg ml from various metallic solutions in the range of 0 54 to 47 43 ppm the qm value for cu ii removal was 84 46 mg g 193 plant leaf extract was also used for the synthesis of hematite nps rod shaped hematite nps synthesized using alovera leaf extract with size and surface area of 100 nm and 18 8 m2 g respectively were found to remove as v from various metallic solutions in the range of 2 to 30 ppm the monolayer adsorption capacity for as v removal was found to be 38 48 mg g at 293 k 194 summarily iron oxide nps synthesized using various methods have been explored for the removal of heavy metals the adsorption capacities of these nps were found to be dependent on their size charge surface area and pore size in addition surface engineering has paved a way to significantly enhance their performances through a simple surface modification process which have resulted in many folds higher adsorption capacities 6 titanium dioxide tio2 nps tio2 nps show good chemical stability low cost photocatalytic behavior and non toxicity 195 which make them a suitable agent for water wastewater treatment applications another pro of tio2 nps in wastewater treatment is its ease of synthesis various natural precursors have been used for tio2 synthesis for example gautam et al synthesized tio2 nps using jatropha curcas l leaf extract and found to have an average particle size of 75 nm with surface area and pore diameter of 27 04 m2 g and 19 10 nm respectively these nps removed 76 48 of cr vi from secondary treated tannery wastewater containing 3 26 ppm metallic concentration through photocatalytic activity in a fabricated parabolic trough reactor ptr at a ph of 5 and and dosage of 1 mg ml 196 natural zeolites like clinoptilolite were also used to prepare tio2 clinoptilolite nanocomposite having a size less than 80 nm with a pore size of 7 06 nm and surface area of 28 73 m2 g the nanocomposite removed 77 of pb ii from wastewater containing 500 ppm lead at a dosage of 800 mg ml and ph of 4 by adsorption of pb ii ions over the composite surface under photocatalytic activity the composite was recovered after treatment and reused up to 4 times by losing 23 8 of removal efficiency 197 biological compounds were also used for the preparation of tio2 nanocomposites for example bio composites of cyclodextrin polycaprolactone tio2 having a rod like structure with 395 nm as average diameter removed 98 of pb ii from 10 ppm of metallic solution the surface area of composites was enhanced 1 3 fold 43 52 m2 g with the addition of tio2 as compared to bare cd pcl the optimal removal of pb ii was obtained at ph 9 7 and the qm value was 0 40 mg g the adsorption process followed the pseudo second order kinetics 198 mahmoud et al used biopolymer cs and synthesized tio2 nps bonded with cs nanolayer ntio2 nch having a spongy shape with a particle size in between 61 95 to 85 14 nm and bet surface area of 1 50 m2 g ntio2 nch composite effectively removed cu ii and cd ii by 86 80 and 72 56 from tap water and 88 01 and 70 67 from wastewater respectively at ph 7 0 within 15 s of microwave heating time the qm values for cd ii and cu ii removal were found to be 120 and 60 mg g respectively 199 besides natural resources and biopolymers the various organic polymer was also used for the preparation of magnetic low cost polyaniline and strontium titanium mp srtio3 composite as shown in fig 8 the spongy polyaniline structure as shown in fig 8 a indicated the polymerization of aniline the embedment of aggregated magnetic nps and srtio3 in the polyaniline layers fig 8 b resulted in the enhancement of surface area for the metal adsorption the prepared composite removed 95 24 as iii from 50 ppm metallic solution removal of arsenic occurred due to the electrostatic attraction between arsenic ions and positive change backbone of nanocomposite due to the presence of amine n and imine n groups in polyaniline the removal occurred within 250 min at an adsorbent dosage of 2 mg ml and ph of 6 the qm value for as iii removal was 67 11 mg g at 303 k 200 gebru et al 201 prepared tio2 nps cellulose acetate composite fibers by using electrospinning technique for the removal of pb ii and cu ii from aqueous solutions the increase in weight of tio2 nps from 0 to 2 5 in ca enhanced surface area of the composite by 38 30 2 to 48 5 m2 g the prepared composite was found to remove 99 7 and 98 9 of pb ii and cu ii under the optimized conditions ph 5 2 for pb ii and 5 8 for cu ii agitation period 5 h adsorbent dosage 2 g l and temperature 35 c from 50 ppm of individual metallic solutions the qm for pb ii and cu ii removal by tio2 nps ca composite as per langmuir isotherm were reported to be 31 9 and 31 4 mg g respectively bimetallic tio2 nps were also investigated for the removal of heavy metals recently mahmoud et al treated radioactive wastewater with tio2 ag2o titanium coated silver oxide nps with the size range of 63 91 nm for the removal of zn and co batch column studies resulted 92 5 and 90 5 removal of zn 65 and co 60 from radioactive wastewater and 94 and 90 removal of zn ii and co ii from tap water of 1 ppm metallic solution at a dosage of 0 5 mg ml and ph of 6 5 the qm values for co ii and zn ii removal were found to be 50 and 100 mg g respectively 202 various natural and inorganic precursors were used for synthesis of tio2 nanoparticles which served as an efficient adsorbent for heavy metals from water wastewater further the removal of tio2 nps from slurry solution after water treatment is difficult and need to be explored more 203 very few examples for the removal of trivalent or more heavy metals could be observed which indicates that high surface to volume ratio is not the only factor which governs the adsorption capacity however more studies are required to explore the exact adsorption mechanism for higher valent heavy metals to optimize the removal process of the tio2 nps in addition mostly tio2 nps have been composited with either metal ions or with the organic polymers which were found to be suitable for enhancing the removal efficiency as tio2 nps are readily porous containing high surface area they can be functionalized with smaller functional groups which may result to alter the efficiency as well as the ability to remove higher valent ions the porous structures provide the opportunity to tune the surface via specific functional groups for aim a specific application 7 biomaterial modified nanomaterials bio nanomaterials includes molecular species of biological origin 204 and are used in several applications like tissue engineering 205 and bio sorption 206 in environmental applications nanomaterials can be combined with biological substrates like chitin chitosan for the development of new bio nanomaterials with high metal removal efficiency 207 209 recently highly monodisperse magnetic cs functionalized with aminothiourea group nanoadsorbent at mcs and having a saturation magnetization of 44 29 emu g was found remove 95 of hg ii from 30 ppm of metallic solution at ph 7 and dosage of 0 2 mg ml the at mcs has also had a higher removal affinity of hg ii from binary metallic solution and was used up to 6 cycles by retaining 94 of its removal efficiency the qm value of at mcs as per langmuir isotherm was 256 41 mg g at 303 15 k 210 another group 211 reported that cs nps were chemically modified with poly methacrylate through electrostatic interaction between nh2 and cooh groups fig 9 to enhance activation of chelating groups the modified nps having spherical morphology and size in the range of 100 120 nm removed 90 86 and 80 of co ii ni ii and cu ii respectively from 100 ppm of individual metallic solutions at ph range of 4 7 within 100 min and dosage of 0 5 mg ml metal removal occurred by formation of complexes between ligands of cma i e nh2 or oh groups present on its surface and empty orbitals of metals which was also accompanied by fixation of hydroxide ions and release of the proton as shown in fig 8 the qm values for co ii ni ii and cu ii removal were found to be 195 220 and 340 mg g respectively multipurpose cost effective nanocomposite beads of cs ag substituted hydroxyapatite cs ag ha for removal of metal dyes and pathogens from water were prepared and found to remove 94 and 93 2 of cu ii from 5 and 130 ppb of metallic tap and river water at ph 7 within 100 min respectively the qm value for cu ii removal was 40 11 mg g 212 hydroxyapatite nanorods nhap and cs modified nhap nhapcs were prepared to investigate adsorption capacity qe for cu ii removal from aqueous solution the nhap found to have a diameter of 5 nm and length of 20 50 nm respectively the adsorption capacity of nhapcs was found to be 1 33 folds higher than that of nhap due to more number nh2 groups imparted from cs the qm value as per langmuir isotherm of nhap for the cu ii removal was reported to be 243 90 mg g 213 chitin a natural polysaccharide was also used for metal removal in a recent study chitin was functionalized with sh groups to enhance the adsorption efficiency the chitin nanofibres found to have a size of 10 30 nm in width the removal of as iii from cs and functionalized cs from 50 ppm of the metallic solution was optimized at ph 7 and dosage of 5 mg ml after functionalization of cs the qe values were found to be enhanced by 300 38 to 158 mg g the removal of as iii through functionalized chitin occurred due to the electrostatic interaction between arsenic species and protonated nh2 groups present on the nanofibres the qm value of functionalized chitin as per langmuir isotherm for as iii removal was reported to be 149 mg g 214 it can be seen from the above examples that an organic inorganic interface provides a better local environment for the metal ions to be adsorbed chelated at the interface for their removal in this regard recently tiwari et al synthesized highly lead resistant bio sorbent beads mbcaab composed of fe oxide nps 10 20 nm and biomass agrobacterium fabrum slaj731 encapsulated in calcium alginate the synthesized beads optimally removed pb ii up to 2900 ppm of metallic solution within 120 min at ph 5 5 and dosage of 1 g l the qm value as per langmuir isotherm for pb ii removal was 197 02 mg g at 310 k 215 similar to that of various inorganic nps biomaterial nps have also been successfully explored for the removal of divalent or trivalent heavy metals the presence of enormous functional groups on the surfaces of biological materials facilitates the removal through electrostatic interactions and formation of ligand metal complexes the removal of pentavalent or other multivalent heavy metals using these systems also needs to be explored in case of biomaterials together with metal ions nh2 functional groups have been found to be proficient for the removal of heavy metals the number of nh2 groups at the surface has been found to play a key role in regulating its efficiency however as discussed above organic and inorganic coupling provides stability as well as the chelating ability for the metal ions to be trapped for effective removal this coupling can be tuned based on the particle morphology thickness of organic phase as well as the site specific conditions more exploration is required to tune these materials for the removal of heavy metals ranging from di to hexavalent metal ions 8 toxicity of nanomaterials the massive use of nanomaterials for the removal of environmental pollutants has unescapably caused their elevated concentrations into the environment these concentrations are majorly found to be in the various wastewater treatment systems 216 majorly cuo tio2 and zno based nanocomposites and nps have been investigated for the efficient removal of various environmental pollutants zhang et al examined the toxic effect of these nps over anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox system both the nitrogen removal as well as the number of anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria were found to be adversely affected cuo and zno nps showed a severe effect on the anammox at a concentration of 1 ppm however tio2 reflected durable inhibition on anammox at the same concentration 216 moreover nps have been proven to synergistically enhance the toxicity of the other pollutants for example tio2 nps at 5 ppm concentration enhanced the toxicity of phenanthrene phe and cadmium cd2 by 2 0 and 12 2 respectively for zooplanktons however the toxicity was reduced to 24 5 and 57 1 for phe and cd2 respectively at higher concentrations i e 400 ppm of tio2 due to aggregation of nps 217 these results indicated the concentration dependent toxicity of the nps the minimum inhibitory concentration mic values of tio2 and gd doped tio2 nps was reported to be 9 7 and 25 ppm for e coli and 19 5 and 25 ppm for s aureus respectively 218 219 the mic values of agnps were found to be in the range of 12 5 to 55 ppm 220 222 various methods such as gold coating 223 green synthesis 224 and microbial synthesis 225 have been utilized to reduce the toxic effect of ag nps over human cells however the toxic effects of agnps produced through these methods are yet to be studied in detail from environmental application point of view likewise 5 ppm concentration of α fe2o3 was found to be toxic for blood cells 226 magnetite was found to be less toxic 200 ppm than that of maghemite 150 ppm for rat pheochromocytoma pc12 cells 227 however these concentrations are comparable to the concentration required for the remediation of heavy metals 165 172 similarly magnetite showed low eco toxicity at sub toxic concentrations 10 and 100 ppm for the neonates of the aquatic crustacean daphnia magna 228 hence the toxic concentration of magnetite can be concluded in the rage of 10 to 200 ppm although the reusability and ease of separation was the additional benefit of the magnetite its long term usage at these concentrations possibly will cause toxic effect over human health as well as the environment including the thickness in blood cell rupturing via oxidative stress 229 and toxicity to the aquatic environment 230 however the toxicity of the magnetite nps can be reduced by a surface functionalization 231 b by compositing it with other nps 232 or c by embedding the nps into a stable matrix in this regard fe3o4 nps were embedded into the graphene nanosheet ns to form graphene fe3o4 composite which prevented the release of fe3o4 nps this composite removed 94 of cr vi from 15 ppm of metallic solution at ph 3 5 within 20 min and removal efficiencies were retained more than 75 up to five cycles 233 similarly nanoadsorbent of poly acrylic acid paa coated fe3o4 nps 24 nm removed 80 and 99 of ni ii and pb ii from 1 ppm of individual metallic solutions at ph 6 temperature 338 k and dosage of 2 mg ml ferrite mesh of 20 layers was used to retain 99 of fe3o4 nps under a low magnetic field 234 in another study alginate beads composed of magnetite graphene oxide mgo were found to remove 40 and 60 of cr vi and as v from 10 ppm of individual metallic solutions at ph 5 and 7 and dosage of 5 g l within 24 h respectively secondary pollution due to release of graphene oxide and iron nps was prevented by incorporating them into mgo and encapsulation of mgo into alginate facilitated the separation regeneration and reuse of the adsorbent 235 fe3o4 nps and agrobacterium fabrum strain slaj731 were incorporated into calcium alginate to form nano adsorbent beads no release of fe3o4 nps from these beads was detected using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy up to five cycles 236 tio2 nps incorporated into macroporous cryogels to form a monolithic composite were found to remove 96 of pb ii from 10 ppm of metallic solution incorporation of tio2 nps in the cryogels prevented their release into the environment while retaining their activities 237 all these studies suggested the incorporation of nps into various matrixes in order to prevent their release to the environment during their applications organic capping or modification have been proven to reduce the toxicity of the nps in this review we found that the dosage concentration of adsorbents for the removal of heavy metal is crucial for the successful adsorption of heavy metals on the other hand nps show the toxic behavior in a dose dependent manner hence in order to design a successful system for wastewater treatment it is recommended to first explore the toxic concentration of the nps and later exploring its metal removal efficiency surface modification plays a crucial role in enhancing the adsorption capacity as well as reduction in the toxicity of the nps hence concentrations lower than that of toxic level should be modified accordingly in order to enhance the adsorption capacity which could result in a sustainable heavy metal removal system 9 challenges and future perspective more attentions are given to enhance the adsorption capacity of the nanomaterials which have been achieved by a large extent due to the numerous advantages of engineered nanomaterials like high adsorption capacity selectivity and fast removal kinetics of heavy metals in water wastewater however there exist some technical glitches which are needed to be addressed stability economics scale up reusability and toxicity are key bottlenecks to be addressed by the researchers generally nanomaterials tend to form agglomerates in the aqueous solution through various surface forces the surface engineering functionalization with functional groups like oh nh2 and cooh organic polymers and biopolymers are found to enhance the stability and adsorption capacity however these studies are still restricted to laboratory stage and a systematic pilot to plant scale studies need to be undertaken in addition for industrial applications materials cost is the most important factor which is higher in case of graphene and carbon based nanomaterials that can be rectified by converting agricultural waste to carbon based nanomaterials or employing various bio nanomaterials further the reusability and fate of nanomaterials are other concerns the toxicity of the metal oxide based nano adsorbents is a major concern among the researchers these days in this direction the emphasis on the synthesis of nanomaterials through green chemistry and utilization of biopolymers should be given the reusability of nanomaterials except for magnetic nps makes the application of nanomaterials improvident and impracticable in real life water pollution situations the magnetic nanomaterials can be easily separated from the water after treatment by applying an external magnetic field the surface modification offers tunable interactions i e adsorption and desorption as a function of ph thus imparted reusability also composites are exhibited the reusability due to their macroscopic nature therefore a nanocomposite of engineered metal oxides with organic inorganic materials or biomaterials may provide a better solution in terms of its removal efficiency selectivity toxicity as well as the separation and the reusability 10 conclusions nanomaterials are widely used as an adsorbent for the removal of contaminants from water wastewater because of their unique property of high surface area to volume ratio which makes them a suitable candidate for the development of future technology in the field of water wastewater treatment in the present review applications of different engineered nanomaterials based on iron oxide titanium oxide silica carbon graphene oxide and bio nanomaterials are discussed along with recent examples these nanomaterials have been reported with varying degree of their adsorption capacities carbon and silica based nanomaterials have resulted in very high adsorption capacities due to their unique special arrangements engineered nanomaterials functionalized were found to enhance the removal capacities by many folds as compared to unmodified ones the presence of oxygen containing functional groups on cnts go and metal oxides based nanomaterials and silanol groups on silica facilitates their surface modification typically surface modification enhanced the adsorption capacity due to change in surface chemistry the nh2 functionalized nanomaterials were best suited for the removal of divalent metal cations while the sh functionalization was found to be proficient for the hg ii removal it was observed that the pristine nps follow the physisorption for the removal of heavy metals however the metal oxide based nps and surface modified ones usually follow the chemisorption due to crosslinking or chelation nano composites offer synergistic properties and were found to remove penta or higher valent heavy metals the composites have also exhibited better reusability undertaken at laboratory studies despite promising results of engineering nanomaterials at lab scale still there are also numerous bottlenecks which are to be overwhelmed for the practical applications toxicity selectivity multi metal adsorption and reusability are some key challenges to be looked for detailed challenges and future perspective are outlined in the above section through this review various prospects of surface engineering and its importance in tuning interfacial interactions towards the removal of heavy metals have been elaborated which are expected to be helpful in taking these nanomaterials to the next

14127,water is polluted by various harmful toxic chemical substances precisely heavy metals dyes and pathogens which have a disastrous effect on the ecological balance of human as well as animal life therefore there is an urgent need for new technologies to remove these noxious pollutants from water wastewater adsorption is one of the predominant method among all the reported techniques for the removal of heavy metals nano technological applications in this direction i e development of nano sized materials tubes and composites as adsorbents have engrossed rapidly in this review current trends of nanomaterials for the removal of heavy metals from water wastewater are concisely discussed applications of different engineered nanomaterials based on iron oxide titanium oxide silica carbon graphene oxide and bio nanomaterials are largely focused different strategies and surface modifiers have been used for the surface modifications functionalization of these nanomaterials which in turn enhanced the adsorption capacities by many folds toxic effects of various nanoparticles are also discussed and various strategies like embedding encapsulation to prevent their releases into the environment are deliberated in addition the selection of nps for the removal of various metals has also been discussed in the respective sections this review will provide an insight into the latest researches which is expected to offer worthy implications to academicians and industry professionals working in environmental engineering domain for the removal of heavy metals from water wastewater keywords nanomaterials heavy metals adsorption removal nano toxicity wastewater treatment surface modification 1 introduction overpopulation industrialization and the modernization of our society lead to both the positive as well as negative impacts like economic development air water and land pollutions water pollution is of severe concern due to its adverse impacts on the living creatures as well as in the surrounding environment owing to the generation of it large quantum sources of water supply like sub surface lake and river are being depleted slowly due to global warming 1 and also contaminated 2 therefore there are pressing demands of new technologies to reuse recycle the generated wastewater for developing countries remediation and treatment of this generated wastewater are of major concern by considering the vital points like recyclability reusability cost and sustainability as the population is increasing rapidly by 2030 the indian population is expected to reach 1 51 billion which would aid in severe water scarcity typically wastewater contains organic pollutants i e detergents pesticides processed foods pharmaceuticals and inorganic pollutants i e salts and heavy metals particularly heavy metals originated from earth crust are not readily degraded or destroyed few metals like copper and zinc in limited amounts are essential for the maintenance of metabolisms in the human body however accumulation of non biodegradable heavy metals including fe cr pb as ni cd se and hg in its various oxidation states by humans and plants in higher concentrations leads to cause severe health and environmental problems 3 therefore there is an urgent need for the removal of these contaminants from wastewater to make it reusable various conventional technologies are available for their remediation such as chemical precipitation 4 membrane filtration 5 6 adsorption 7 10 ion exchange 11 photocatalysis 12 15 and coagulation and flocculation 16 17 among all these technologies adsorption onto nanomaterials is the proficient removal technique for heavy metals from wastewater as other methods do not deal effectively and their limits have reached for adequate removal 18 21 various adsorbents bare or surface modified like biopolymers 22 24 activated carbon 25 chelating minerals 26 27 engineered nanomaterials 28 31 nanofiltration 32 34 and nanocomposites 35 40 have been employed for the removal of heavy metals along with other pollutants from wastewater nanotechnology the conscious control of matter to restrict its size less than 100 nm has led to developing new materials which have certain relative unique properties that cannot be found in bulk sized materials usefulness of nanomaterials has been reported by various researchers due to their large surface area and surface free energy small size active atomicity and reactivity the high surface area to volume ratio of nanomaterials immensely improvises its sorption efficiency further surface modification is a powerful tool which improvises the properties of a material through imparting the desired functional groups on its surface without compromising with the bulk properties 41 46 surface modification of nanomaterials by forming various functional groups i e amine nh2 carboxylic cooh thiol sh and methyl on their surfaces have been explored and resulted in enhanced performances 40 47 these features led to the vast applications of engineering nanomaterials 48 55 extensive efforts have been dedicated to nanomaterials for the wastewater treatment various nanomaterials like nanorods 56 58 nano spheres 59 60 and nanotubes 61 64 have been explored for the removal of heavy metals however nanomaterials also have certain limitations i e high cost 65 poor efficiency of recycling and toxicity therefore some low cost adsorbents have also been scrutinized such as rice husk 66 sawdust 67 sugarcane bagasse 68 and orange peel 69 although adsorption is one of the proficient technique because of its low cost and ease of availability of wide range of adsorbents however various bottlenecks are yet to be addressed to achieve a reputed status in the commercial sectors the present review mainly emphases on nanomaterials for the removal of heavy metals e g as iii pb ii hg ii cr iv cd ii and ni ii from the aqueous solution tap water and industrial wastewater salient features of the emerging nanomaterials like their constituents characteristics modes of action and removal efficiencies are thoroughly discussed and highlighted surface modification strategies of nanoparticles nps and their applications towards the removal of heavy metals are discussed in relevant sections to highlight its significance also the principal mechanism of heavy metals sorption is highlighted examples of some promising nps and nanocomposites are discussed including iron oxide titanium oxide carbon silica graphene oxide and bio nanomaterials nps of cuo tio2 agnps and zno and their toxicity levels after their release into the environment were also discussed in individual sections four comprehensive tables listing various nanomaterials their adsorption capacities and optimal conditions are also supplemented for the better understanding to readers 2 carbon nanotubes carbon has the ability to form carbon to carbon long chains due to its binding capability in both straight and complex branching s which enables double or triple bond formation and collection of atoms in different geometrical arrangements 70 carbon nanomaterials have been widely used for the removal of heavy metals due to their high sorption capacities and non toxicity 71 72 recent studies also revealed an increasing trend in the application of carbon based nanomaterials for wastewater treatment 73 75 the discovery of carbon structures by iijima in 1991 established high potential of carbon nanotubes cnts for the removal of heavy metals 76 77 cnts have commonly been fabricated by chemical vapor deposition cvd method cnts are further divided into single walled cnts swcnts and multi walled cnts mwcnts having a length of several 100 1000 nm and width of 1 3 nm 78 however the low adsorption capacity of cnts demands its surface functionalization functional groups such as cooh nh2 and oh have been tested for the surface modification of cnts through chemical routes which immensely improved their adsorption capacities 79 80 the mechanism of heavy metal s removal by cnts is very complicated and comprised of electrostatic interactions ligand exchange surface complexes formation and sorption precipitation between the metallic ion species and functional groups attached over cnts surface 81 this leads to the applications based functionalization of cnts for the removal of heavy metals few examples of the carbon nanostructured materials with and without surface functionalization are discussed below and summarized in table 1 typically mwcnts are found to have higher adsorption capacity than cnts for a given adsorbate 2 1 non functionalized carbon nanotubes various pristine carbon based one dimensional nanomaterials have been utilized for the metal removal high surface area to volume ratio has been found as a key factor for their high adsorption capacity in this context mwcnts synthesized by cvd technique and having a width in the range of 60 70 nm and length in microns removed 100 cd ii at a dosage of 0 5 mg ml from 100 ppm metallic solution at ph 10 and 12 respectively the interaction of mwcnts with cadmium ions was achieved by the ultrasonic environment which resulted in the maximum adsorption capacity qm value of 181 81 mg g of mwcnts as per langmuir isotherm 88 yet the adsorption was achieved within 90 s however the removal of metal ions in the presence of ultrasonic waves challenges its practical applicability at a larger scale various studies have been performed without the use of any external energy for example mwcnts synthesized by tubular microwave cvd technique and having a length of 10 microns and diameter ranging from 13 to 20 nm removed 98 and 99 99 of cd ii 89 and zn ii 90 respectively from 10 ppm individual metallic solutions the cd ii removal was occurred at ph 5 within 50 min and dosage of 1 mg ml while zn ii at ph 10 within 60 min and dosage 0 2 mg ml the qm values of mwcnts for cd ii and zn ii removal as per langmuir isotherm were found to be 88 62 and 90 9 mg g respectively this explains that not only the no of layers but also the width of the cnts also plays a crucial role in the metal adsorption the discussed examples explained that at lower dimensions cnts do not require any external energy source for the adsorption of the heavy metals mwcnts synthesized by the above technique and having diameter ranging from 15 to 23 nm removed 99 and 99 9 of cu ii 91 and pb ii 92 respectively from 10 ppm of individual metallic solutions within 35 and 22 5 min the removal of cu ii and pb ii was optimized at ph 5 5 and dosage of 0 4 mg ml the qm values of mwcnts as per langmuir isotherm for cu ii and pb ii removal were found to be 99 and 104 2 mg g respectively also in a separate study cnts synthesized by two stage cvd technique having diameter ranging from 30 to 33 nm removed 83 of cr vi from 1 ppm of metallic solution within 120 min at ph 9 and dosage of 9 mg ml the qm value of cnts for cr vi removal as per langmuir isotherm was 2 49 mg g 93 these studies suggest that an average width of 15 to 25 nm provides the required surface area for the effective removal of heavy metals from the bulk in addition the role of the ph can also be explained in the removal of heavy metals the removal of heavy metals is quicker at acidic ph due to the adsorption in form of ions as the main species however at basic ph these metals form hydroxides and get precipitated with higher efficiency although basic ph requires longer time duration which can be tuned by reducing the width of cnts by choosing a suitable oxidizing agent during the synthesis process 88 94 although the mwcnts have been proven efficient in the removal of heavy metals yet their efficacy and time required for the removal of heavy metals depend on the ph of the reaction this lag can be overcome by the surface functionalization via altering the surface charge of the functional bodies of the mwcnts 2 2 functionalized carbon nanotubes although non functionalized carbon nanomaterials provide sufficient adsorption capacity yet their reusability and selectivity for heavy metal s have been a great challenge for the environmental engineers hence researchers are focusing on the functionalization of these carbon nanomaterials to address the above mentioned limitations novel carbon microspheres cms prepared by hydrothermal carbonization of xylose obtained from agricultural waste and functionalized with boronic acid having a spherical shape of about 20 nm have been tested for the removal of cr vi ni ii and cu ii the functionalization enhanced the surface area from 26 1 to 76 1 m2 g and pore volume from 0 043 to 0 176 cm3 g the surface charge of cms functionalized with boronic acid decreased from 7 mv to 37 mv in the ph range of 2 to 10 resulting in the formation of the tetrahedral anion from neutral trigonal of cms which enabled better adsorption of metallic ions through electrostatic interactions the qm values for cu ii cr vi and ni ii removal were found to be 183 38 mg g 175 67 mg g and 205 7 mg g at ph of 3 2 and 7 respectively and were retained more than 75 up to three adsorption cycles hence the functionalization of cms can enhance the surface area and pore volume by 3 to 4 folds for the better adsorption of the metal ions 95 another group 96 prepared a biocompatible sorbent by condensation of fructose and modification by porphyrin which was found to have an enormous surface area of 289 m2 g and an average pore diameter of 8 nm these carbon nanostructures were found to efficiently remove fe iii ni ii cd ii and cu ii from 5 ppm of metallic solutions at a ph of 7 during column studies in the flow rate of 3 0 21 0 ml min the qm values for cd ii cu ii ni ii and fe iii removal were 81 6 48 3 41 4 and 53 6 mg g respectively the removal efficiencies of the prepared nanostructure from a real wastewater sample of a plating industry were found to be about 99 98 97 and 96 for cd ii cu ii ni ii and fe iii respectively polyethyleneimine multiwalled carbon nanotube polymeric nanocomposite pei mwcnts were prepared from functionalized mwcnts as shown in fig 1 nh2 groups of branched pei were linked with cooh groups of f mwcnts in the presence of sodium hydroxide naoh and epichlorohydrin at 65 c to prepare the nanocomposite the synthesized pei mwcnts with an average diameter of 25 nm pore volume of 2 10 3 cm3 g and surface area of 1 70 m2 g removed 99 of cr vi from 10 ppm metallic solution at a dosage of 2 mg ml within 60 min and ph 4 the qm value for cr vi removal was 40 mg g this prepared nano composite was reused 5 times by losing only 20 of its adsorption efficiency 97 another group reported 98 that coating of polydopamine pda and functionalization of pei over cnts enhanced its adsorption capacity towards cu ii removal the cnts were coated with pda in alkaline medium through mussel chemistry and further peis were conjugated on cnts pda surface to form cnts pda pei via michael addition reaction as shown in fig 2 the qm value of the prepared adsorbent for the cu ii removal was reported to be 70 9 mg g at 292 k recently hayati et al 99 reported super high removal adsorption capacities of tubular shape cnts modified with poly amidoamine dendrimer pamam g4 these modified cnts of diameter 10 30 nm removed pb ii and cu ii from 100 ppm binary solutions at ph 7 with a dosage of 0 03 mg ml nh2 binding sites on the surface of pamam chelated the metal ions by coordinating one metal ion which led to the transfer of nh2 charge over the metal surface and in turn offered huge adsorption capacity the qm values for pb ii and cu ii removal were found to be 4870 and 3333 mg g respectively the surface area occupied per mol of pb ii and cu ii on the cnts were reported to be 43 734 and 18 618 m2 respectively the abundance of amide groups over pamam structure was solely responsible for the high metal adsorption through coordination and chelation magnetic carbon nanomaterials are also prepared and explored for the removal of heavy metals mwcnts were doped with zero valent iron particles fe0 in a cvd reactor to form a magnetic fe mwcnts the prepared magnetic fe mwcnts removed 74 and 77 of as iii and as v within 60 min from 10 ppm of the individual metallic solutions at ph 6 7 and dosage of 0 2 g l fe0 tends to oxidize in water solution and forms fe2 and fe3 hydroxides which then formed complexes with arsenic species and removal of arsenic ions took place the qm values for as iii and as v removal as per langmuir isotherm were found to be 200 and 250 mg g respectively 100 in another study 101 comparison between adsorption efficiency of magnetic biochar mbc and mwcnts functionalized with carboxyl and methyl groups was investigated the mwcnts and mbc removed 93 and 85 of sn ii within 90 min from 0 1 ppm metallic solution at a ph of 5 and dosage of 1 mg ml a higher qm value of 0 459 mg g for mwcnts was observed than that 0 344 mg g for mbc also mwcnts were oxidized with hno3 and kmno4 to generate functional groups and found to have better qm values for cd ii removal than mbc i e 83 33 and 62 5 mg g respectively the mwcnts and mbc removed 90 and 80 of cd ii within 90 min from 10 ppm metallic solution at ph 5 and dosage of 1 mg ml 102 these observations explain that the functionalization enhances the surface properties such as surface area pore volume and surface charge 95 which in turn affects the adsorption of heavy metals even at acidic ph within a shorter duration as discussed in section 2 1 the acidic ph provides quick removal of metal ions but its efficiency remains low due to the direct adsorption of metals in their respective ionic forms the surface functionalization alters the surface charge and facilitates a quicker adsorption with a higher efficiency and thus removes the lag of non functionalization for the removal of most of the divalent metal ions nh2 functionalization is found to be more efficient at neutral ph due to the enhanced zeta potential and surface area although the huge adsorption capacity of metals from water wastewater through cnts has many benefits but there are few aspects which need to be resolved for example the development of cost effective cnts to increase their commercial use has been an obstacle in addition the recycle reuse of cnts from water wastewater after adsorption of toxic metals is difficult which would increase the risk of secondary pollution hence the development of new materials or modification of the existing materials with high adsorption capacity is required which can serve for the effective removal of toxic metals with the ease of separation and reusability 3 graphene nanomaterials graphene has a honeycomb network structure and was extracted from graphite and it also possesses good mechanical properties electrical properties and thermal conductivity 103 it was available in many forms such as graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide r go and also used for the removal of heavy metals from water wastewater go is the oxidative product of graphene prepared by modified hummers method mhm which contains a variety of oxygen functional group i e carbonyl and epoxy groups 104 while r go is the reduction product of go having more structural defects than graphene but can be easily modified by functional groups such as oh nh2 and cooh ahmed et al 105 reported 95 removal of zn ii by using go nanosheets from the effluent of electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor the removal was optimized at ph of 6 3 initial zn ii concentration of 0 4 ppm and dosage of 1 by weight the removal mechanism of zn ii removal was electrostatic interactions between the metal ions and go nanosheets due to the presence of oxygen containing functional groups such as epoxy and oh on go basal plane the qm value of the go nanosheet for zn ii removal was found to be 243 9 mg g as per langmuir isotherm another group reported that nano adsorbents nano sheets of go with magnetic iron nps 10 nm assembled on polystyrene having zeta potential of 16 mv thickness of 1 2 nm and surface area of 28 15 m2 g removed 90 of pb ii at a dosage of 2 mg l and ph of 6 within 8 h from 10 ppm of metallic solution removal of pb ii ions occurred through electrostatic interactions between the electronegative oxygen of nano adsorbent and positive pb ii ions in the aqueous solution which was confirmed by ftir results i e peak shift and decrease in the intensity of co and co of nano adsorbent the qm value of the prepared nano sheets was 73 52 mg g and 60 removal efficiency remained after 4 cycles of recycling 111 graphene oxide and iron manganese go fe mn composite having average bet surface area pore diameter and total pore volume of 153 43 m2 g 2 46 nm and 0 095 cm3 g respectively was first time investigated for the removal of hg ii the presence of oxygen containing functional groups i e co coc o co and co on go fe mn composite enhanced removal efficiency of hg ii from 75 to 89 as compared to fe mn composite from 1 ppm of metallic solution the qm value of the composite was 32 95 2 64 mg g as predicted by sips model fe mn oxides on the surface of graphene oxide shown in fig 3 adsorbed hg ii and facilitated the removal of mercury from metallic solution through ligand exchange between surface oh groups of go fe mn and hg oh 2 and a surface complexation model 106 go can also be easily modified by adding a variety of functional groups to improve its adsorption behavior 109 110 for example gos were combined with fe3o4 nps and functionalized with the different amounts 1 0 2 0 and 5 0 g of polydimethyldiallyl pmdaac denoted as pmdaac 1 0 pmdaac 2 0 and pmdaac 5 0 to enhance the adsorption process by its long chain of carbon atoms go functionalized with pmdaac 2 0 pmgo 2 removed 99 of cr vi from 70 ppm metallic solution at a ph of 4 5 and a dosage of 2 g l the qm value of pmgo 2 was 95 2 mg g 108 another group 107 synthesized go based inverse spinel nickel ferrite gonf nanocomposite by chemical co precipitation method the gonf having dark and shiny morphology shown in fig 3 triangular shape with surface area of 136 m2 g and average particle size of 37 25 nm removed 99 6 and 93 of cr iii and pb ii respectively from 10 ppm of metallic solutions at a dosage of 0 75 and 0 5 g l within 120 min at ph of 6 chemisorption of metal ions on surfaces of gonf exhibited different surface morphologies as compared to bare ones as shown in fig 4 the qm values of the nanocomposite were reported to be 64 10 mg g and 46 08 mg g for cr iii and pb ii respectively as per langmuir isotherm and nanocomposite was reused up to 3 cycles by losing only 5 of its efficiency table 2 lists go and rgo based adsorbents along with their methods of preparation optimal conditions and adsorption capacities for various heavy metals the go prepared by the direct oxidation of graphite using k2cr2o7 have shown the highest qm value for pb ii presumably due to its high content of cooh groups 109 as compared to go prepared by other modified hummers methods also thiol functionalized rgo was found to be a novel adsorbent for hg ii removal high specific surface area and good chemical constancy of r go make it suitable for the water wastewater treatment 105 106 stannic oxide quantum dots decorated r go nanocomposite removed 99 97 and 98 of pb ii hg ii and cd ii from 5 ppm of individual metallic solutions at a dosage of 0 5 mg ml within 1 h the qm value of r go nanocomposite for pb ii removal was 18 58 mg g 119 silver nps and rgo based mesoporous manganese oxide nanocomposite ag nps meso r go having flaky pastry like morphology with a pore radius of 1 3 nm and surface area of 54 m2 g removed 68 of cr vi at a dosage of 6 66 mg ml from 50 ppm of the metallic solution removal of cr vi ions was facilitated through electrostatic interactions between the surface of metal oxides nanocomposites ag nps r go and chromium anions the qm value for cr vi removal was 140 mg g 120 all these studies together suggest that the mechanism of heavy metals removal through graphene based nanomaterials is based upon surface metal hydroxide precipitation and electrostatic interactions this interaction depends on the surface area as well as the surface charge more is the surface area higher is the adsorption capacity 120 which directly depends upon the specifically tunable morphology of the go based nanomaterials however the study of these nanomaterials towards industrial application still needs to be explored specifically for the real wastewater treatment which consists a mixture of pollutants the reuse and recyclability of graphene based nanomaterials also need to be further investigated from an economic point of view 121 in case of go the functionalization via metal oxides largely enhances the electronegative charge over the go enhancing the removal efficiency of the gos however functionalization with organic charged group is still required to be explored for its practical applications the benefit of using the organic charged groups remains in the selection of length and the density of the side chain which may provide stable higher charge as well as the required surface area for the higher removal efficiency at the neutral ph 4 silica nanomaterials the three dimensional network structure of silica sio2 122 makes it porous and provides good mechanical strength and a large surface area thermal stability and water stability which provides easier access to metal ions to reach the inner surface at a higher reaction rate 123 the presence of silanol group sioh on the surface of the silica nanomaterials acts as a chelating agent for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants from water wastewater 124 in a recent study by ahmed et al 105 it was found that 99 5 of zn ii was removed by using sio2 nps from the effluent of electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor the removal was occurred in 4 h at a ph of 8 2 initial zn ii concentration of 0 4 ppm and dosage of 2 wt the qm of sio2 nps for zn ii removal was found to be 9 1 mg g as per langmuir isotherm silica nps their composites and surface functionalized silica have been explored for the heavy metals removal 125 various approaches to modify the silica surfaces have been reported to enhance its adsorption capacity silica nps were modified with different functional groups i e nh2 phosphonate poly ethylene glycol cooh sh nh2 octadecyl and carboxylate octadecyl groups to reduce their aggregation and enhancing adsorption efficiency and some of the recent examples are listed in table 3 the nh2 functionalized silica particles were best suitable for the removal of divalent metal cations the sh functionalization was found to be proficient for the hg ii removal although silica nps provide higher adsorption capacity due to their above discussed surface properties yet its commercial applications are restricted because of their tendency to aggregate in the aqueous solution in this context bagwe et al functionalized silica nps with nh2 groups in order to reduce the aggregation as shown in fig 5 and achieved higher removal efficiency as well as controlled the non specific binding of the metal ions 126 various surface modifiers have been used to modify the surface of silica particles to chelate the metal ions from aqueous solution and tap water for example nh2 functionalized mesoporous silica having an average pore size of 4 39 nm and surface of 395 m2 g removed 67 99 5 82 and 99 8 of zn ii cu ii cd ii and pb ii respectively from 1 0 mm individual metallic solutions at ph of 5 07 and dosage of 1 mg ml the nh2 groups over the adsorbent surface formed the coordination bond with heavy metal ions which enabled their effective removal the qm values for removal zn ii cu ii cd ii and pb ii were reported to be 111 8 mg g 181 74 mg g 152 87 mg g and 484 84 mg g respectively 133 in brief mesoporous and nanoporous silica nps provide higher qm values for di valent metal ions such as cd ii but the nh2 functionalization further enhanced the qm values by 2 to 3 folds as extracted from the above examples this provides an opportunity to the environmental material engineers to tune the silica based nanocomposites for their site as well as target specific applications in the metal removal a separate study by vojoudi et al revealed that mercaptoamine functionalized silica coated magnetic nps maf scmnps having a size of 13 6 nm and surface area of 71 9 m2 g adsorbed pb ii and hg ii at a dosage of 0 4 and 0 2 mg ml and ph of 6 5 and 5 5 respectively from 50 ppm individual metallic solutions the maf scmnps interacted more efficiently with the metal ions due to the multiple numbers of nh2 and sulfur adsorption sites over its surface the removal occurred through the exchange of ions between sh functional groups present on the nano adsorbent surface and heavy metal ions and the modified nps retained 93 adsorption efficiency after 5 cycles of adsorption desorption the qm values of maf scmnps for the removal of pb ii and hg ii were reported to be 292 and 355 mg g respectively 134 also nanoporous sba 15 were modified with bis 3 triethoxysilylpropyl tetrasulfide for the enhancement of the surface area to increase the adsorption efficiency the modified sba 15 adsorbent 100 nm with pore size of 4 6 nm and surface area of 377 m2 g removed 95 6 and 96 2 of as iii ions from tap water and lake water respectively from 25 ppm of spiked metallic concentrations at ph 8 within 30 min and dosage of 1 2 mg ml the qm value for as iii removal was 322 6 mg g 135 in addition the composites of silica based nanomaterials have also been studied for the removal of toxic metals in a study mesoporous silica calcium phosphate synthesized by one pot method with a surface area of 314 56 m2 g particle size of about 20 nm and bimodal pore distribution of 3 82 nm and 12 4 nm removed 99 65 of cd ii at ph of 6 within 30 min and dosage of 2 5 g l from 100 ppm of metallic solution the qm value for cd ii removal was 125 63 mg g and only about 20 removal efficiency was reduced after 3 removal cycles 136 in another study nanocomposites of nanosilica and nanopolyaniline sil phy npani having a size in the range of 7 14 23 91 nm were found to remove cd ii pb ii hg ii and cu ii from seawater industrial wastewater and drinking tap water samples nanopolyaniline had abundance of nh2 and imine functional groups over its surface which interacted with the metal ions and enhanced the adsorption efficiency adsorption experiments were performed using a micro pack column at a flow rate of 10 ml min and adsorbent dosage of 0 1 mg ml the binding of metal ions m ii with sil phy npani nanocomposite through electrostatic interactions as shown in fig 6 the functional groups responsible for binding with heavy metal ions with the composite were nh2 groups of polyaniline and oh groups of silica the qm values for cd ii pb ii hg ii and cu ii were reported to be 136 98 1428 6 256 4 and 1000 mg g respectively 137 the high surface area porosity and the presence of sioh over silica based nanomaterials make them efficient adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals however their aggregation in the aqueous solution is still a major concern which can be reduced by a surface modification to quite some extent sioh enables easy functionalization through crosslinking hence more research is required for the practical applicability of silica based materials for the removal of heavy metals the nh2 functionalization has been proven to provide excellent chelating ability to the silica based nps and was found to remove various heavy metals with higher efficiency i e higher removal at lower dosage near to the neutral ph this enables the real time application of functionalized silica based nps for the treatment of the water wastewater in addition removal of higher valent metals pentavalent or more using sio2 nanomaterials is also required to be explored which can be assisted via coupling it with the other organic systems 5 iron oxide based nanomaterials iron fe oxide nps have a large prospective for the environmental remediation for a wide range of contaminants due to their low cost ease of manufacture and modification nano ranged iron oxides have a high surface area to volume ratio superparamagnetism low toxicity chemical inertness and biocompatibility 138 and can easily immobilize other adsorbents over its surface for the enhanced activities fe based nanomaterials have been explored in many morphologies such as nps nano ovals nanobelts and nanorings 139 142 as well as its composite with graphene based materials for heavy metal removal as discussed in section 3 metal removal through adsorption on iron oxide nps in aqueous solution leads to the aggregation of nps and competitive adsorption from other adsorbates these large aggregates thus formed in the aqueous solution alter their magnetic properties as well as remove different inorganic and organic pollutants from water wastewater this non dispersion ability of iron nps in aqueous solution can be reduced by synthesis optimization reducing surface energy and surface modification methods 143 surface modifications by attaching different organic molecules inorganic shells for preventing fe nps oxidation have been explored 144 147 functional groups like cooh and nh2 groups are found to increase their stability adsorption efficiency and surface area for chelating metal ions from water wastewater 148 recently nh2 functionalized fe3o4 nh2 nps were formed with the enhanced surface area due to the grafting of amino groups over its surface these prepared fe3o4 nh2 nps removed 97 94 cr vi and 98 56 ni ii from 1 ppm metallic tap water at ph 6 6 the qm values for the cr vi and ni ii removal as per langmuir isotherm were reported to be 222 12 and 232 15 mg g respectively 149 in a distinct study it was concluded that nh2 functionalized fe3o4 sio2 nh2 showed good solvent dispersion ability and magnetic property the prepared fe3o4 sio2 nh2 nps have optimal removal of zn ii from pickling waste at ph of 5 0 and dosage of 0 5 mg ml from 100 ppm metallic solution the qm value for zn ii removal was 169 5 mg g 150 reaction 1 shows the removal of zinc by attaching to the nh2 functionalized mnps in another study 151 it was revealed that magnesium ferrite mgfe2o4 nps functionalized with nh2 were found to have higher adsorption capacity than fe3o4 nh2 these mgfe2o4 nh2 nps removed 99 pb ii from 15 ppm metallic solution at ph 4 the large surface area of 56 5 m2 g for mgfe2o4 nh2 nps arose from the cluster formation of porous mgfe2o4 in the aqueous solution the qm values for pb ii removal was 135 1 mg g in addition 152 fe3o4 nh2 nps exhibited the excellent rapid chelating properties for both metal cations and anions and optimally removed of cu ii and cr iv from 600 ppm individual metallic solutions at ph 5 and 6 respectively the qm values for cu ii and cr iv removal as per langmuir isotherm were reported to be 12 43 and 11 24 mg g respectively the nh2 functionalization as scrutinized in above examples elucidates that nh2 functionalization incorporates high surface area and alters the surface charge over the fe based nps to enhance their adsorption capacity in addition as discussed in section 4 nh2 functionalization reduces the aggregation of nps which in turn enhances the applicability as well as the reusability of the inorganic nanoparticles 1 organic polymers like poly γ glutamic acid γ pga coated magnetic nps removed 99 24 99 63 77 17 and 99 63 of cr iii cu ii ni ii and pb ii at a dosage of 80 mg ml from 50 ppm metallic solutions respectively the flocculating nature of γ pga resulted in the metal ions to bind over it and also stabilized the magnetic nps in the aqueous solution the qm value of nps for cr iii removal was 24 60 mg g 153 also the coating of fe3o4 nps by humic acid ha was found to enhance the stability of nps by preventing the aggregation of nps these coated nps fe3o4 ha removed 99 and 95 of hg ii and pb ii from 0 1 ppm aqueous solution respectively the optimum dosage and ph for the removal were 0 1 mg ml and 6 respectively the qm values for hg ii and pb ii as per langmuir isotherm were found to be 92 4 and 97 7 mg g respectively 154 all the three forms of fe oxide have been investigated for water wastewater treatment applications i e magnetite fe3o4 maghemite γ fe2o3 and hematite α fe2o3 155 156 which are discussed in the following sections various iron oxide based nanomaterials as adsorbent optimal conditions and their adsorption capacities for various heavy metals are summarized in table 4 as revealed from table surface functional groups were participated in the chelation removal of toxic metal ions these groups also facilitated easy desorption as a function of ph and thus imparted reusability rhodanine attached over maghemite nps exhibited a large adsorption capacity of hg ii due to the presence of sulfur groups 5 1 magnetite fe3o4 nps fe3o4 nps are not stable in the aqueous environment due to their high surface energy 164 however their stability was enhanced by various organic inorganic supports which are deliberated below and some of them are discussed in table 4 various surfactants have been coated on fe3o4 nps to overcome agglomeration in the aqueous solution like fe3o4 nps coated with an anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate removed 15 0 98 1 and 89 3 of cu ii ni ii and zn ii respectively at ph 6 within 1 min and dosage of 0 75 mg ml from industrial wastewater the qm values for cu ii ni ii and zn ii removal were found to be 24 3 41 2 and 59 2 mg g respectively and reused 5 times without considerably losing its removal efficiency 165 a cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide 166 was also used to cap fe3o4 nps through the electrostatic interaction oh nh4 between surface oh groups of fe3o4 and the ammonium groups in ctab fig 7 these modified nps showed enhanced removal 95 77 of cr vi at ph 4 and dosage of 12 mg ml from 100 ppm metallic solution as compared to uncapped nps 74 49 cr vi adhered to the ammonium functional groups present on the surface and was reduced to insoluble cr iii hydroxide as shown in fig 7 in another study 167 fe3o4 nps synthesized with tetramethylammonium hydroxide having spherical particles of 15 30 nm with surface area of 12 7 m2 g removed 58 4 of cr vi and 100 of pb ii at ph of 2 and 5 in 20 ppm and 10 ppm of chromium and lead solutions respectively at a dosage of 1 0 g l the qm values for cr vi and pb ii removal were found to be 34 9 mg g and 53 1 mg g respectively and the adsorbent was effectively reused twice surface functionalization not only provides the stability to the magnetic nps for its reusability but also enhances its removal efficiency for example wang et al revealed that organic polymers like poly glycidyl methacrylate when coated on fe3o4 nps through radical polymerization and linked by β cyclodextrin having spherical morphology removed 79 5 of cu ii in 24 h from 45 ppm metallic solution at a dosage of 0 4 mg ml 168 mollahosseini et al 169 coated fe3o4 nps with polypyrrole ppy through oxidative polymerization for the removal of al iii from the aqueous solution the prepared ppy fe3o4 composite with a spherical diameter ranging from 30 to 150 nm removed al iii within 20 min at a ph of 3 dosage of 100 μg ml and 5 μg ml of initial metal concentration the qm value of ppy fe3o4 composite for al iii removal was reported to be 270 27 mg g as per langmuir isother and were reused 5 times by losing 32 7 of its removal efficiency in another study by singh et al 170 reported 96 of cd ii removal by using citric acid cac coated fe3o4 nps from 25 ppm of aqueous solution the adsorption of cd ii on cac fe3o4 nps took place at ph of 5 temperature 35 c and contact time of 60 min the prepared adsorbent showed 99 8 desorption of cd ii in 0 2 m hcl solution and was experienced for eight times desorption the qm value of cac fe3o4 nps for cd ii removal at 308 k was found to be 12 56 mg g as per langmuir isotherm also silane coupling agents were used to increase nps stability and zeta potential it was reported that fe3o4 nps fabricated on halloysite nanotubes hnt surfaces and modified by 3 piperazinepropylmethyldi methoxysilane kh 108 and anilino methyl triethoxysilane kh 42 removed 81 35 cr vi and 50 sb v at ph of 3 and 100 cr vi and 98 8 sb v at ph of 2 from 20 ppm binary metallic solutions the zeta potential of both kh 108 and kh 42 modified nps varies from 10 to 38 mv in the ph range of 2 10 the qm values of kh 108 modified nps for sb v and cr vi removal as per langmuir isotherm were reported to be 30 49 and 59 90 mg g at 308 k respectively 171 biopolymer like chitosan was also convoluted for preparation of fe3o4 chitosan nanocomposites on the basis of nh2 and oh functional groups present on chitosan for example fe3o4 nps capped with p sulfonatodansylcalix 4 arene and chitosan composite having the spherical shape of size 17 nm and pore size of 0 19 nm were found to remove hg ii from 0 35 ppm metallic solution at a dosage of 10 mg ml the qm value for hg ii removal was 86 65 mg g 172 wang et al 173 prepared mussel inspired fe3o4 nps with pda and additionally cross linked with cs to form the nanoadsorbent pda cs fe3o4 for the removal of hg ii pb ii and cr vi the qm values for hg ii cr vi and pb ii were found to be 256 152 and 47 mg g respectively the synthesized nano absorbent retained its adsorption efficiency upto four adsorption desorption cycles in another study 174 aminated fe3o4 nps having an average size of 50 nm were filled into chitosan polyvinyl alcohol nanofibres to form a nonporous membrane over polyethersulfone the synthesized membrane of 60 5 μm thickness was found to have optimal removal of cr vi and pb ii at ph of 6 and 2 from 20 ppm individual metallic solutions with an adsorbent dosage of 0 5 mg l respectively at lower ph value electrostatic interaction occurred between the nh2 and oh groups present on the nanofibrous membrane and chromium anions i e cr2o7 2 and hcro4 while for the lead removal an extra number of active sites were available on the nanofibrous membrane due to the presence of oh groups the qm values for lead and chromium removal were found to be 509 7 and 525 8 mg g respectively organic groups present in the natural resources were also used to modify magnetite nps for example sebastian et al used phenolic groups present in the husk of coconut shell to fabricate onto fe3o4 np and resulted in the effective adsorption of ca and cd from the aqueous medium at ph of 6 and temperature of 40 c with a dosage of 3 6 to 4 0 mg ml the separation of metal ions was due to the presence of cooh group fabricated on the fe3o4 nps from coconut husk which contains benzoic and caffeic acids the qm values for cd and ca removal were reported to be 9 6 and 13 7 mg g respectively 175 the presence of a nitrogen atmosphere during magnetite nps synthesis also contributed to increasing its removal efficiency in this direction wang et al synthesized fe3o4 nps by co precipitation method through nitrogen passing denoted as ncm and without nitrogen passing cm and removed 80 56 and 42 37 for ncm and 48 06 and 25 91 for cm of pb ii and cr iii respectively from 20 ppm metallic solutions at a dosage of 4 mg ml within 180 min nps were quasi spherical shaped with an average diameter of 15 nm and surface area of 125 77 m2 g for ncm was enhanced as compared to cm 107 55 m2 g the qm values for pb ii and cr iii removal by ncm were found to be 3 44 and 2 77 mg g at 293 k respectively 176 these studies together confirm that fe3o4 and its composite are efficacious in the removal of hexavalent than that of divalent or trivalent heavy metals however successful coupling with organic compounds may enhance the removal capacity of divalent heavy metals as well coupling with organic compounds enhances the solubility of fe3o4 in the aqueous media which in turn enhances the adsorption behavior of the fe3o4 and its compounds in addition it was found that the surface modification via nh2 and other positive ions enhanced the dispersion stability as well as the removal efficiency of fe3o4 nps via many folds close to the neutral ph on the other hand negatively charged surface modification acid based enabled efficient removal of heavy metals at higher dosage and lower heavy metal concentrations hence nh2 functionalization has been proven to be more efficient for the removal of higher valent metal ions 5 2 maghemite γ fe2o3 nps maghemite nps are more stable in the aqueous medium than magnetite and show ferromagnetic behavior maghemite nps are synthesized using various techniques like cvd 177 co precipitation 178 flame spray pyrolysis 179 sol gel method 180 hydrothermal method 181 and microemulsions 182 in a study maghemite nps synthesized by cvd technique using green vitriol and pyrite byproduct from titanium dioxide production having cubical shape with surface area pore volume average diameter and pore size of 14 63 m2 g 0 068 cm3 g 35 nm and 11 6 nm respectively removed 92 52 as iii at ph of 11 with dosage of 3 mg ml from 10 ppm metallic solution the qm value for as iii removal as per langmuir isotherm was 14 4 mg g at 328 15 k 177 also rajput et al fabricated maghemite nps onto glass fiber filters by flame spray pyrolysis technique the nps having hexagonal platelet size surface area the pore diameter of 3 6 to 15 7 nm 79 4 m2 g and 9 1 nm respectively were found to remove 59 2 pb ii and 25 cu ii at ph of 5 and dosage of 0 1 g l from 10 ppm metallic solutions the qm values for cu ii and pb ii removal as per langmuir isotherm were found to be 34 0 mg g at 218 k and 68 9 mg g at 318 k respectively 179 functionalization of these nps makes them more stable and also improves their metal removal efficiency like maghemite nps functionalized with glycine having spherical shape of 10 5 nm and surface area of 175 m2 g were found to have highly efficient removal of 98 cu ii at ph of 6 5 and dosage of 0 15 mg ml within 60 min from 10 ppm of metallic solution the qm value of cu ii removal was enhanced to 625 mg g 183 seraj et al coated the maghemite nps with pr and found to have a size of 10 nm particle size which removed 70 of cr vi at ph of 2 5 and dosage of 10 g l from 80 ppm metallic solution the qm value of synthesized nanoparticle was 25 85 mg g and was stable enough to reused up to 3 cycles 184 in summary maghemite and its compounds are more soluble in aqueous media however their lesser magnetic properties and agglomeration cause trouble in the separation as compared to the magnetite in addition maghemite nps are usually utilized for the removal of divalent heavy metals than that of pentavalent or more not many studies have been found for the functionalization of maghemite nps and the removal efficiency is directly dependent on the morphology of the maghemite nps controlling of morphology requires higher energy inputs which enhances the overall cost of the product for real time applications however modification with positively charged functional groups seems to be promising for enhancing the removal efficiency and maybe reconnoitered to verify the removal ability for lower to higher valent ions 5 3 hematite α fe2o3 nps hematite nps are the most stable in aqueous solution than magnetite and maghemite and show antiferromagnetic behavior hematite nps are synthesized using various substrates like silica 185 186 alginate 187 188 cs 189 and used for water treatment purposes hematite bagasse nanocomposites synthesized in the range of 50 100 nm were found to remove pb ii at ph of 5 0 and dosage of 2 mg ml in 30 ppm lead solution the binding energy and gibbs free energy of adsorption process were found to be 135 7 ev and 39 73 to 50 72 kj mol respectively which indicate spontaneous adsorption of pb ii on nanocomposites surface the qm value of the nanocomposite was 16 57 mg g at 298 15 k 190 another group 191 reported that low cost hematite nps coated with volcanic rock having pore volume and bet surface area of 5 63 10 3 cm3 g and 1 87 m2 g respectively removed 99 5 of cd ii from 100 ppm metallic solution through film and inter particle diffusion at a ph of 6 0 and dosage of 1 mg ml the qm value of hematite nps was 158 48 mg g at 313 k hematite nps as a photocatalyst also have very good efficiency for metal removal in water recently wang et al revealed that oh α fe2o3 nps synthesized by solvothermal method with an average particle size in range of 11 27 nm were found to remove cr vi in 20 ppm metallic solution at a dosage of 0 5 mg ml under photocatalytic activity and enhance removal efficiency from 24 8 to 70 2 due to synergetic effect 192 also chen et al reported that nano hematite as a photocatalyst having granular shape with an average particle size and surface area of 75 nm and 24 82 m2 g respectively were found to have optimal removal of cu ii at ph of 5 2 0 1 temperature of 298 k and dosage of 0 3 mg ml from various metallic solutions in the range of 0 54 to 47 43 ppm the qm value for cu ii removal was 84 46 mg g 193 plant leaf extract was also used for the synthesis of hematite nps rod shaped hematite nps synthesized using alovera leaf extract with size and surface area of 100 nm and 18 8 m2 g respectively were found to remove as v from various metallic solutions in the range of 2 to 30 ppm the monolayer adsorption capacity for as v removal was found to be 38 48 mg g at 293 k 194 summarily iron oxide nps synthesized using various methods have been explored for the removal of heavy metals the adsorption capacities of these nps were found to be dependent on their size charge surface area and pore size in addition surface engineering has paved a way to significantly enhance their performances through a simple surface modification process which have resulted in many folds higher adsorption capacities 6 titanium dioxide tio2 nps tio2 nps show good chemical stability low cost photocatalytic behavior and non toxicity 195 which make them a suitable agent for water wastewater treatment applications another pro of tio2 nps in wastewater treatment is its ease of synthesis various natural precursors have been used for tio2 synthesis for example gautam et al synthesized tio2 nps using jatropha curcas l leaf extract and found to have an average particle size of 75 nm with surface area and pore diameter of 27 04 m2 g and 19 10 nm respectively these nps removed 76 48 of cr vi from secondary treated tannery wastewater containing 3 26 ppm metallic concentration through photocatalytic activity in a fabricated parabolic trough reactor ptr at a ph of 5 and and dosage of 1 mg ml 196 natural zeolites like clinoptilolite were also used to prepare tio2 clinoptilolite nanocomposite having a size less than 80 nm with a pore size of 7 06 nm and surface area of 28 73 m2 g the nanocomposite removed 77 of pb ii from wastewater containing 500 ppm lead at a dosage of 800 mg ml and ph of 4 by adsorption of pb ii ions over the composite surface under photocatalytic activity the composite was recovered after treatment and reused up to 4 times by losing 23 8 of removal efficiency 197 biological compounds were also used for the preparation of tio2 nanocomposites for example bio composites of cyclodextrin polycaprolactone tio2 having a rod like structure with 395 nm as average diameter removed 98 of pb ii from 10 ppm of metallic solution the surface area of composites was enhanced 1 3 fold 43 52 m2 g with the addition of tio2 as compared to bare cd pcl the optimal removal of pb ii was obtained at ph 9 7 and the qm value was 0 40 mg g the adsorption process followed the pseudo second order kinetics 198 mahmoud et al used biopolymer cs and synthesized tio2 nps bonded with cs nanolayer ntio2 nch having a spongy shape with a particle size in between 61 95 to 85 14 nm and bet surface area of 1 50 m2 g ntio2 nch composite effectively removed cu ii and cd ii by 86 80 and 72 56 from tap water and 88 01 and 70 67 from wastewater respectively at ph 7 0 within 15 s of microwave heating time the qm values for cd ii and cu ii removal were found to be 120 and 60 mg g respectively 199 besides natural resources and biopolymers the various organic polymer was also used for the preparation of magnetic low cost polyaniline and strontium titanium mp srtio3 composite as shown in fig 8 the spongy polyaniline structure as shown in fig 8 a indicated the polymerization of aniline the embedment of aggregated magnetic nps and srtio3 in the polyaniline layers fig 8 b resulted in the enhancement of surface area for the metal adsorption the prepared composite removed 95 24 as iii from 50 ppm metallic solution removal of arsenic occurred due to the electrostatic attraction between arsenic ions and positive change backbone of nanocomposite due to the presence of amine n and imine n groups in polyaniline the removal occurred within 250 min at an adsorbent dosage of 2 mg ml and ph of 6 the qm value for as iii removal was 67 11 mg g at 303 k 200 gebru et al 201 prepared tio2 nps cellulose acetate composite fibers by using electrospinning technique for the removal of pb ii and cu ii from aqueous solutions the increase in weight of tio2 nps from 0 to 2 5 in ca enhanced surface area of the composite by 38 30 2 to 48 5 m2 g the prepared composite was found to remove 99 7 and 98 9 of pb ii and cu ii under the optimized conditions ph 5 2 for pb ii and 5 8 for cu ii agitation period 5 h adsorbent dosage 2 g l and temperature 35 c from 50 ppm of individual metallic solutions the qm for pb ii and cu ii removal by tio2 nps ca composite as per langmuir isotherm were reported to be 31 9 and 31 4 mg g respectively bimetallic tio2 nps were also investigated for the removal of heavy metals recently mahmoud et al treated radioactive wastewater with tio2 ag2o titanium coated silver oxide nps with the size range of 63 91 nm for the removal of zn and co batch column studies resulted 92 5 and 90 5 removal of zn 65 and co 60 from radioactive wastewater and 94 and 90 removal of zn ii and co ii from tap water of 1 ppm metallic solution at a dosage of 0 5 mg ml and ph of 6 5 the qm values for co ii and zn ii removal were found to be 50 and 100 mg g respectively 202 various natural and inorganic precursors were used for synthesis of tio2 nanoparticles which served as an efficient adsorbent for heavy metals from water wastewater further the removal of tio2 nps from slurry solution after water treatment is difficult and need to be explored more 203 very few examples for the removal of trivalent or more heavy metals could be observed which indicates that high surface to volume ratio is not the only factor which governs the adsorption capacity however more studies are required to explore the exact adsorption mechanism for higher valent heavy metals to optimize the removal process of the tio2 nps in addition mostly tio2 nps have been composited with either metal ions or with the organic polymers which were found to be suitable for enhancing the removal efficiency as tio2 nps are readily porous containing high surface area they can be functionalized with smaller functional groups which may result to alter the efficiency as well as the ability to remove higher valent ions the porous structures provide the opportunity to tune the surface via specific functional groups for aim a specific application 7 biomaterial modified nanomaterials bio nanomaterials includes molecular species of biological origin 204 and are used in several applications like tissue engineering 205 and bio sorption 206 in environmental applications nanomaterials can be combined with biological substrates like chitin chitosan for the development of new bio nanomaterials with high metal removal efficiency 207 209 recently highly monodisperse magnetic cs functionalized with aminothiourea group nanoadsorbent at mcs and having a saturation magnetization of 44 29 emu g was found remove 95 of hg ii from 30 ppm of metallic solution at ph 7 and dosage of 0 2 mg ml the at mcs has also had a higher removal affinity of hg ii from binary metallic solution and was used up to 6 cycles by retaining 94 of its removal efficiency the qm value of at mcs as per langmuir isotherm was 256 41 mg g at 303 15 k 210 another group 211 reported that cs nps were chemically modified with poly methacrylate through electrostatic interaction between nh2 and cooh groups fig 9 to enhance activation of chelating groups the modified nps having spherical morphology and size in the range of 100 120 nm removed 90 86 and 80 of co ii ni ii and cu ii respectively from 100 ppm of individual metallic solutions at ph range of 4 7 within 100 min and dosage of 0 5 mg ml metal removal occurred by formation of complexes between ligands of cma i e nh2 or oh groups present on its surface and empty orbitals of metals which was also accompanied by fixation of hydroxide ions and release of the proton as shown in fig 8 the qm values for co ii ni ii and cu ii removal were found to be 195 220 and 340 mg g respectively multipurpose cost effective nanocomposite beads of cs ag substituted hydroxyapatite cs ag ha for removal of metal dyes and pathogens from water were prepared and found to remove 94 and 93 2 of cu ii from 5 and 130 ppb of metallic tap and river water at ph 7 within 100 min respectively the qm value for cu ii removal was 40 11 mg g 212 hydroxyapatite nanorods nhap and cs modified nhap nhapcs were prepared to investigate adsorption capacity qe for cu ii removal from aqueous solution the nhap found to have a diameter of 5 nm and length of 20 50 nm respectively the adsorption capacity of nhapcs was found to be 1 33 folds higher than that of nhap due to more number nh2 groups imparted from cs the qm value as per langmuir isotherm of nhap for the cu ii removal was reported to be 243 90 mg g 213 chitin a natural polysaccharide was also used for metal removal in a recent study chitin was functionalized with sh groups to enhance the adsorption efficiency the chitin nanofibres found to have a size of 10 30 nm in width the removal of as iii from cs and functionalized cs from 50 ppm of the metallic solution was optimized at ph 7 and dosage of 5 mg ml after functionalization of cs the qe values were found to be enhanced by 300 38 to 158 mg g the removal of as iii through functionalized chitin occurred due to the electrostatic interaction between arsenic species and protonated nh2 groups present on the nanofibres the qm value of functionalized chitin as per langmuir isotherm for as iii removal was reported to be 149 mg g 214 it can be seen from the above examples that an organic inorganic interface provides a better local environment for the metal ions to be adsorbed chelated at the interface for their removal in this regard recently tiwari et al synthesized highly lead resistant bio sorbent beads mbcaab composed of fe oxide nps 10 20 nm and biomass agrobacterium fabrum slaj731 encapsulated in calcium alginate the synthesized beads optimally removed pb ii up to 2900 ppm of metallic solution within 120 min at ph 5 5 and dosage of 1 g l the qm value as per langmuir isotherm for pb ii removal was 197 02 mg g at 310 k 215 similar to that of various inorganic nps biomaterial nps have also been successfully explored for the removal of divalent or trivalent heavy metals the presence of enormous functional groups on the surfaces of biological materials facilitates the removal through electrostatic interactions and formation of ligand metal complexes the removal of pentavalent or other multivalent heavy metals using these systems also needs to be explored in case of biomaterials together with metal ions nh2 functional groups have been found to be proficient for the removal of heavy metals the number of nh2 groups at the surface has been found to play a key role in regulating its efficiency however as discussed above organic and inorganic coupling provides stability as well as the chelating ability for the metal ions to be trapped for effective removal this coupling can be tuned based on the particle morphology thickness of organic phase as well as the site specific conditions more exploration is required to tune these materials for the removal of heavy metals ranging from di to hexavalent metal ions 8 toxicity of nanomaterials the massive use of nanomaterials for the removal of environmental pollutants has unescapably caused their elevated concentrations into the environment these concentrations are majorly found to be in the various wastewater treatment systems 216 majorly cuo tio2 and zno based nanocomposites and nps have been investigated for the efficient removal of various environmental pollutants zhang et al examined the toxic effect of these nps over anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox system both the nitrogen removal as well as the number of anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria were found to be adversely affected cuo and zno nps showed a severe effect on the anammox at a concentration of 1 ppm however tio2 reflected durable inhibition on anammox at the same concentration 216 moreover nps have been proven to synergistically enhance the toxicity of the other pollutants for example tio2 nps at 5 ppm concentration enhanced the toxicity of phenanthrene phe and cadmium cd2 by 2 0 and 12 2 respectively for zooplanktons however the toxicity was reduced to 24 5 and 57 1 for phe and cd2 respectively at higher concentrations i e 400 ppm of tio2 due to aggregation of nps 217 these results indicated the concentration dependent toxicity of the nps the minimum inhibitory concentration mic values of tio2 and gd doped tio2 nps was reported to be 9 7 and 25 ppm for e coli and 19 5 and 25 ppm for s aureus respectively 218 219 the mic values of agnps were found to be in the range of 12 5 to 55 ppm 220 222 various methods such as gold coating 223 green synthesis 224 and microbial synthesis 225 have been utilized to reduce the toxic effect of ag nps over human cells however the toxic effects of agnps produced through these methods are yet to be studied in detail from environmental application point of view likewise 5 ppm concentration of α fe2o3 was found to be toxic for blood cells 226 magnetite was found to be less toxic 200 ppm than that of maghemite 150 ppm for rat pheochromocytoma pc12 cells 227 however these concentrations are comparable to the concentration required for the remediation of heavy metals 165 172 similarly magnetite showed low eco toxicity at sub toxic concentrations 10 and 100 ppm for the neonates of the aquatic crustacean daphnia magna 228 hence the toxic concentration of magnetite can be concluded in the rage of 10 to 200 ppm although the reusability and ease of separation was the additional benefit of the magnetite its long term usage at these concentrations possibly will cause toxic effect over human health as well as the environment including the thickness in blood cell rupturing via oxidative stress 229 and toxicity to the aquatic environment 230 however the toxicity of the magnetite nps can be reduced by a surface functionalization 231 b by compositing it with other nps 232 or c by embedding the nps into a stable matrix in this regard fe3o4 nps were embedded into the graphene nanosheet ns to form graphene fe3o4 composite which prevented the release of fe3o4 nps this composite removed 94 of cr vi from 15 ppm of metallic solution at ph 3 5 within 20 min and removal efficiencies were retained more than 75 up to five cycles 233 similarly nanoadsorbent of poly acrylic acid paa coated fe3o4 nps 24 nm removed 80 and 99 of ni ii and pb ii from 1 ppm of individual metallic solutions at ph 6 temperature 338 k and dosage of 2 mg ml ferrite mesh of 20 layers was used to retain 99 of fe3o4 nps under a low magnetic field 234 in another study alginate beads composed of magnetite graphene oxide mgo were found to remove 40 and 60 of cr vi and as v from 10 ppm of individual metallic solutions at ph 5 and 7 and dosage of 5 g l within 24 h respectively secondary pollution due to release of graphene oxide and iron nps was prevented by incorporating them into mgo and encapsulation of mgo into alginate facilitated the separation regeneration and reuse of the adsorbent 235 fe3o4 nps and agrobacterium fabrum strain slaj731 were incorporated into calcium alginate to form nano adsorbent beads no release of fe3o4 nps from these beads was detected using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy up to five cycles 236 tio2 nps incorporated into macroporous cryogels to form a monolithic composite were found to remove 96 of pb ii from 10 ppm of metallic solution incorporation of tio2 nps in the cryogels prevented their release into the environment while retaining their activities 237 all these studies suggested the incorporation of nps into various matrixes in order to prevent their release to the environment during their applications organic capping or modification have been proven to reduce the toxicity of the nps in this review we found that the dosage concentration of adsorbents for the removal of heavy metal is crucial for the successful adsorption of heavy metals on the other hand nps show the toxic behavior in a dose dependent manner hence in order to design a successful system for wastewater treatment it is recommended to first explore the toxic concentration of the nps and later exploring its metal removal efficiency surface modification plays a crucial role in enhancing the adsorption capacity as well as reduction in the toxicity of the nps hence concentrations lower than that of toxic level should be modified accordingly in order to enhance the adsorption capacity which could result in a sustainable heavy metal removal system 9 challenges and future perspective more attentions are given to enhance the adsorption capacity of the nanomaterials which have been achieved by a large extent due to the numerous advantages of engineered nanomaterials like high adsorption capacity selectivity and fast removal kinetics of heavy metals in water wastewater however there exist some technical glitches which are needed to be addressed stability economics scale up reusability and toxicity are key bottlenecks to be addressed by the researchers generally nanomaterials tend to form agglomerates in the aqueous solution through various surface forces the surface engineering functionalization with functional groups like oh nh2 and cooh organic polymers and biopolymers are found to enhance the stability and adsorption capacity however these studies are still restricted to laboratory stage and a systematic pilot to plant scale studies need to be undertaken in addition for industrial applications materials cost is the most important factor which is higher in case of graphene and carbon based nanomaterials that can be rectified by converting agricultural waste to carbon based nanomaterials or employing various bio nanomaterials further the reusability and fate of nanomaterials are other concerns the toxicity of the metal oxide based nano adsorbents is a major concern among the researchers these days in this direction the emphasis on the synthesis of nanomaterials through green chemistry and utilization of biopolymers should be given the reusability of nanomaterials except for magnetic nps makes the application of nanomaterials improvident and impracticable in real life water pollution situations the magnetic nanomaterials can be easily separated from the water after treatment by applying an external magnetic field the surface modification offers tunable interactions i e adsorption and desorption as a function of ph thus imparted reusability also composites are exhibited the reusability due to their macroscopic nature therefore a nanocomposite of engineered metal oxides with organic inorganic materials or biomaterials may provide a better solution in terms of its removal efficiency selectivity toxicity as well as the separation and the reusability 10 conclusions nanomaterials are widely used as an adsorbent for the removal of contaminants from water wastewater because of their unique property of high surface area to volume ratio which makes them a suitable candidate for the development of future technology in the field of water wastewater treatment in the present review applications of different engineered nanomaterials based on iron oxide titanium oxide silica carbon graphene oxide and bio nanomaterials are discussed along with recent examples these nanomaterials have been reported with varying degree of their adsorption capacities carbon and silica based nanomaterials have resulted in very high adsorption capacities due to their unique special arrangements engineered nanomaterials functionalized were found to enhance the removal capacities by many folds as compared to unmodified ones the presence of oxygen containing functional groups on cnts go and metal oxides based nanomaterials and silanol groups on silica facilitates their surface modification typically surface modification enhanced the adsorption capacity due to change in surface chemistry the nh2 functionalized nanomaterials were best suited for the removal of divalent metal cations while the sh functionalization was found to be proficient for the hg ii removal it was observed that the pristine nps follow the physisorption for the removal of heavy metals however the metal oxide based nps and surface modified ones usually follow the chemisorption due to crosslinking or chelation nano composites offer synergistic properties and were found to remove penta or higher valent heavy metals the composites have also exhibited better reusability undertaken at laboratory studies despite promising results of engineering nanomaterials at lab scale still there are also numerous bottlenecks which are to be overwhelmed for the practical applications toxicity selectivity multi metal adsorption and reusability are some key challenges to be looked for detailed challenges and future perspective are outlined in the above section through this review various prospects of surface engineering and its importance in tuning interfacial interactions towards the removal of heavy metals have been elaborated which are expected to be helpful in taking these nanomaterials to the next

14128,metal organic frameworks mofs have become one of the most attractive classes of materials due to their versatile features it is desirable to evaluate the photocatalysis performance of mofs in aquatic medium in this study graphene oxide compositing mil 101 fe go mil 101 fe was fabricated based on this mof a light mof h2o2 photocatalysis system was developed to degrade tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep go mil 101 fe has a lower band gap energy 2 17 ev than mil 101 fe 2 41 ev suggesting an expansion of visible light absorption from 520 nm to 570 nm under 420 nm irradiation removal of tcep under the 15 go mil 101 fe photocatalysis system followed pseudo first order kinetic with a reaction rate constant at 1 64 10 3 s 1 using go mil 101 fe a fast activation and electron transfer was achieved due to the high conductibility of go resulting in a higher removal efficiency of tcep 95 at 30 min than using mil 101 fe 50 the basic reaction mechanism involved the excitation of electrons from homo oxygen orbitals in ligands to lumo fe ii fe iii in core nodes induced by visible light irradiation followed by the electron transport between go mil 101 fe and h2o2 to generate oh go mil 101 fe visible light photocatalysis would be a potential treatment process for organic contaminants keywords radical oxidation metal organic frameworks emerging organic contaminants degradation light emitting diode 1 introduction metal organic frameworks mofs have attracted worldwide scientists and engineers because of their versatile features 1 2 typical mofs are constructed by metal cores and organic ligands through covalent bonds with nearly infinite combinations as a result mofs show extensive potential applications in sort of fields such as catalytic synthesis 3 energy transfer 4 gas storage separation 5 chemical sensing 6 biomedical applications 7 and heterogeneous photocatalysis 8 recently researchers have made more attempt regarding to the mofs based photocatalysis elimination of contaminants in water 9 11 mofs containing iron core fe based mofs can become feasible photocatalysts because of low cost environmentally friendly and photosensitive feature typical fe based mofs are the mil series such as mil 101 12 these structures make fe based mofs a series of photoresponsive porous coordination polymers and light irradiation can induce an electrons excitation and transport between the mof interface and h2o2 or other oxidant donors these processes can generate hydroxyl radicals oh and other radical species which can degrade and even mineralize various organic pollutants 13 thus fe based mofs may become feasible photocatalysts for contaminant elimination whereas the full photocatalysis application of fe based mofs is still obstructed by several weaknesses first poor stability in aqueous mediums is a critical weakness for particular mofs 14 furthermore low quantum yield due to inefficient excitons generation and electron separation also impedes their photocatalytic processes 15 several strategies have been proposed to mitigate these drawbacks combinations with strong chemical bands were used to synthesize steady mofs 16 high valence metals including ti zr fe al and cr were selected to form core nodes and then strong organic acids were used to form the ligands according to pearson s acid base principle these strong acid basic combinations would be more stable in acid and neutral aqueous conditions 17 another approach is compositing mofs with some substrates such as semiconductor nanoparticles 15 18 carbon nanotubes 19 graphene oxide go 20 23 etc composite of go may improve the dispersion of go mofs while the cover of go layer through combinations with epoxy and hydroxyl functional groups onto mof can enhance the firmness of mofs recently polychlorinated and polybrominated flame retardants were banned worldwide therefore organic phosphorous flame retardants opfrs became an alternative flame retardants 24 researchers proposed that opfrs would be a potential environment problem according to their highly persistence and toxicity 25 26 thus it is desirable to develop cost effective technologies for the elimination of these flame retardants to date synthesis of go mofs for photocatalysis is rarely reported 23 27 28 the go mof hybrid materials have shown enhanced stability dispersive forces and photocatalytic efficiency compared to their parent mofs furthermore introducing of go may alter the photochemistry feature of go fe based mofs in the current study go composite mil 101 fe was synthesized and characterized tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep was selected as the targeted contaminant while its degradation efficiency in go mil 101 fe photocatalysis was tested performances between go mil 101 fe and mil 101 fe was compared reaction mechanisms in these systems were investigated while the stability was also evaluated it would be an important aspect for the target application of go fe based mofs as photocatalyst in aquatic mediums 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical materials graphene oxide go 99 1 5 layers layer diameter 2 10 μm single layer thickness 1 nm was obtained from chinese academy of sciences benzene 1 4 dicarboxylic acid h2bdc n n dimethylformamide dmf tcep 98 5 tert butyl alcohol tba and 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine tempo 98 were purchased from tci ethyl alcohol etoh ascorbic acid 99 and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 99 were purchased from sigma analytical grade fecl3 6h2o h2o2 30 nano3 nacl and na2so4 were obtained from sinopharm 2 2 synthesis and characterization of go mil 101 fe a facile fabrication of mil 101 fe and go mil 101 fe were performed by a hydrothermal method for mil 101 fe a typical combination of 0 415 g 2 5 mmol h2bdc and 1 351 g fecl3 6h2o 5 0 mmol were added into 30 ml of dmf and this dmf suspension was under ultrasonic treatment for 15 min the mixture was transferred to a teflon autoclave 120 c 20 h the obtained solid centrifuged and washed by dmf and etoh to eliminate the raw stuff the purified products were dried 70 c 30 min and activated 150 c 10 h for go mil 101 fe after the mixing of h2bdc and fecl3 6h2o into dmf particular amount of go 2 5 10 15 and 20 mass ratios of h2bdc fecl3 6h2o was added into 6 ml etoh the suspension was treated by ultrasonication for 10 min and then these two suspensions were mixed a further 5 min ultrasonication was conducted and then the mixture was transferred to a teflon autoclave 120 c 24 h the purified products were dried at 70 c for 30 min and activated at 150 c for 10 h characterization of these two mofs followed similar methods reported in our previous study 29 2 3 basic photocatalysis experiments a multiple wavelength light emitting diodes leds irradiation device was assembled fig s1 which contained a light source framework and reactor vessel detailed information about the reaction device was reported in our previous study 30 the solution ph was maintained by a naoh kh2po4 and h3po4 mixture buffered solution for one reaction 20 ml solution was applied this solution was shaken orbitally under 60 rpm solid mil 101 fe or go mil 101 fe was added in the reaction solution and a 30 min pre absorption was conducted photocatalytic treatments were begun by turning on the leds and spiking h2o2 solution 30 at given time points 1 0 ml suspension samples were harvested and then equivalent sodium sulfite solution was added to stop the reaction the obtained mixture was filtrated by 0 22 μm polyethersulfone filter 2 4 influence factor and mechanism exploration experiments several influence factors including wavelength go ratio ph temperature h2o2 vs go mil 101 fe mass ratio and inorganic anions concentration at 10 mm were tested by changing the particular factor upon the basic experiment scavenging agents and epr were applied to determine the photocatalytic mechanism in scavenging experiments etoh tba and ascorbic acid all at 100 mm were added for epr dmpo was applied as oh spin trapping agent epr instrument settings were power at 11 52 mw sweep width at 120 g modulation amplitude at 1 00 g time constant at 78 92 ms conversion time at 40 ms resolution in x 1024 and resolution in y 20 40 tempo was applied to be the stable radical standard for spin adducts quantitative analysis the relative intensities of spin adduct were determined by comparing integrated areas of peaks which had the best fit linear regression of tempo 2 5 recyclability and stability experiments during recyclability experiments after the first reaction cycle the used powder was separated by centrifugation and it was washed with 200 ml deionized water after drying the powder was used for further reaction cycle total three cycles were applied for stability experiment the fe3 and fe2 concentrations in the filtrated solution after reactions were determined by an inductive coupled plasma emission spectrometer 2 6 determination of tcep and degradation products quantitative and qualitative determination of tcep and its products were conducted following similar methods reported in our previous study 31 2 7 molar absorption coefficient calculation molar absorption extinction coefficients ε were used to present light absorption capacities of cl no3 and so4 2 the measurement and calculation of ε followed similar methods reported in our previous study 32 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mofs fig 1 a and b show the sem of mil 101 fe and 10 go mil 101 fe figs s2 and s3 present the sem of go 2 5 15 and 20 go mil 101 fe agglomerates flakes of graphene sheets were observed for go of note the agglomerates of mil 101 fe and go mil 101 fe nanocomposite look totally different mil 101 fe consists of regular polyhedron at 1 0 4 0 μm diameter after compositing a small amount 2 of go the hybrid crystal presents a decreasing size 1 0 2 0 μm with a similar polyhedron shape fig s3a as the go ratio increased the crystal size continuously decreased for example the size of 20 go mil 101 fe was approximate 0 5 1 0 μm furthermore some disk shape and other shape crystals were observed figs s3c and s3d suggesting the distortion of mil crystal generation of mil 101 fe can extend in any spatial orientation however the go sheets can restrain the possible generation orientation of mil 101 fe resulting in the smaller and irregular go mil 101 fe crystal as the go ratio increased this phenomenon aggravated similar hypothesis was also proposed during go mil 101 cr synthesis 33 the xrd patterns of go mil 101 fe and go mil 101 fe measured in a range of 2θ from 5 to 40 are presented in fig 1c go show 002 diffraction peak at 2θ 11 1 indicating its amorphous layer structure xrd of original mil 101 fe contained four peaks at 2θ 8 9 9 7 19 6 and 21 7 which was consistent with previous study 34 for 2 go mil 101 fe similar but weaker characteristic peaks were observed however as the go composite ratio increased the peak intensities declined which may be the result of the partial distortion of mil 101 fe 35 of note no diffraction peak at 2θ 11 1 was observed in go mil 101 fe which may be due to the high dispersion of go 14 36 the ft ir of go contained two characteristic peaks at around 1610 and 1720 cm 1 which related to the oxygen functional groups such as co and coh on go surface fig 1d ft ir of mil 101 fe demonstrated a different ft ir pattern and its characteristic peaks were at 750 1020 1396 1583 and 1680 cm 1 fig 1d peak 750 cm 1 may be the ch bond in benzene peaks 1396 cm 1 and 1583 cm 1 could present the carboxyl bond coo peak 1680 cm 1 may originate from co bonds in carboxyl these characteristic peaks were also reported in other literature about mil 101 fe 37 of note variations of characteristic peaks were observed for go mil 101 fe first peak at 1680 cm 1 tended to disappear as the go ratio increased second a blue shift was observed for 1583 cm 1 peak after go was added generation of mil 101 fe was restrained furthermore go surface contained lots of oxygen functional groups which can react with the carboxyl groups coo on mil 101 fe finally generating a series irregular co and or co chains reduction of the amount of co bonds of free carbonyl induced the disappearance of 1680 cm 1 peak the blue shift of peak 1583 cm 1 can be explained by the overlay and interference of the go characteristic peak for other peaks such as 750 1020 and 1396 cm 1 no variation was observed these alterations of ft ir spectroscopy implied the interaction between go and mil 101 fe which may build up electron transfer efficiency the addition of go can also alter the characteristic absorption spectrum of mofs uv vis drs was applied to identify the photochemical properties of go mil 101 fe and go mil 101 fe fig 1e for go no reflection was observed in the range of 200 850 nm for mil 101 fe high light reflectance in the range of 550 850 nm was observed after adding go the reflectance in this range gradually declined implying a visible light absorption band gap energy e g was applied for the investigation of photo utilization fig 1f calculation of band gap energy e g followed a reported method 38 mil 101 fe has e g at 2 41 ev implying that light irradiation 520 nm can activate the electron transports of mil 101 fe for go mil 101 fe with go addition e g was calculated to be around 2 17 ev 570 nm suggesting an expansion of absorption wavelength this decreasing bandgap can be attributed to the improvement of electrical conductibility by go after go was composited with mil 101 fe its impaired conductive network with abundant π electrons was connected onto mil 101 fe surface providing a highway for electron transfer of note uv irradiation can be easily screened by various natural organic matter and anions diffuse in the natural water bodies but it is not true for visible light thus the bandgap expansion implied that the utilization efficiency of light sources was improved for go mil 101 fe photocatalysis system in actual water treatment the xps spectra of go mil 101 fe are measured fig 2 first survey spectrum indicated it contained c o and fe elements as shown in fig 2b the c1s spectrum could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 284 6 286 0 and 288 5 ev these peaks could be attributed to carbon atoms bond cc and carbon organic linkers co and oco in go mil 101 fe respectively the o1s peak also can be divided into three peaks at 530 2 531 7 and 533 1 ev corresponding to the oxygen atoms in the feo bonds co linkers and co linkers of go mil 101 fe respectively fig 2c for the xps spectrum of fe2p fig 2d two strong peaks at 724 9 ev and 711 8 ev were attributed to fe2p1 2 and fe2p3 2 respectively which suggested that fo bonds were presented in go mil 101 fe these xps spectra as well as the sem xrd ft ir indicated the successful synthesis of go mil 101 fe 3 2 basic performance and influence factors several control experiments were conducted first adsorption and h2o2 oxidation were considered fig s4 sole go adsorption and sole h2o2 oxidation had little effect on tcep but mil 101 fe and go mil 101 fe both had 20 adsorption with an equilibrium in 30 min therefore in the subsequent experiments a 30 min pre adsorption was conducted sole light irradiation cannot degrade tcep directly fig s5a for light h2o2 treatments only 280 nm h2o2 can degrade tcep fig s5b uv c induced cleavage of h2o2 to generate oh which contributed to the degradation of tcep light mil 101 fe and light go mil 101 fe contributed no decrease of tcep figs s5c s5d although some wavelength photons can activate these two mofs to an excitation state the absence of oxidant donor may result in the rapid recombination of electrons and holes in mofs go h2o2 mil 101 fe h2o2 and go mil 101 fe h2o2 were tested figs s6 and 3a the go h2o2 seemed to have a negligible removal after 120 min reaction 20 tcep was removed by mil 101 fe h2o2 go mil 101 fe h2o2 presented a rapid degradation of tcep approximate 80 tcep was removed within 120 min indicating that go mil 101 fe may induce a transformation of h2o2 into oh higher removal efficiencies were observed in light go mil 101 fe h2o2 systems go composite ratio 15 fig 3 a in the subsequent experiment it was called mof photocatalysis system for short irradiation with different wavelengths demonstrated distinct degradation efficiencies compared to the go mil 101 fe h2o2 system activation by long wave visible light 587 and 625 nm had little effect but shorter wave visible irradiation 420 492 and 535 nm had significant improvements the mof photocatalysis system with 420 nm presented the highest efficiency with a removal up to 95 within 30 min go mil 101 fe has a band gap at 570 nm section 3 1 thus 420 492 and 535 nm visible light and uv can be absorbed and utilized resulting in a fast activation of go mil 101 fe and faster electron transport in the presence of h2o2 the enhanced photocatalysis reaction was achieved irradiation higher than 570 nm cannot be utilized by go mil 101 fe considering that uv irradiation is susceptible to impurities in natural water mof photocatalysis systems with short wave visible light especially 420 nm were more applicable go composite ratio had a significant effect on photocatalysis performance fig 3b mil 101 fe can be considered as the one contained no go compositing the degradation curve of the 420 nm mil 101 fe h2o2 system demonstrated a slow decreasing stage before 20 min with a removal of tcep at 8 and then a rapid degradation stage was observed within 20 120 nm as composite ratio increased the degradation efficiency increased and reached a peak value with composite ratio at 15 go compositing can enhance separation of the photogenerated electron hole pairs and the electron transformation efficiency approximate 95 tcep was degraded in the 15 go mil 101 fe photocatalysis system at 30 min however when the go composite ratio increased to a higher level 20 excessive amount of go layer can cover most surface of mil 101 fe affecting the adsorption and mass transfer capacities of go mil 101 fe of note the variation curve in go mil 101 fe photocatalysis presented a continuous degradation pattern without the initial slow stage implying a different reaction mechanism compared to mil 101 fe in the subsequent experiments 15 go mil 101 fe and 420 nm were applied variation of initial ph value had a significant effect fig 3c a fastest degradation rate was achieved at ph 3 00 after ph grew to 5 00 tcep degradation followed a slower rate with a similar pattern when ph continuously increased negligible removal of tcep was confirmed under the acid condition the abundant h in solution induced the protonation and positive charging on the mof surface this was benefit to h2o2 attraction resulting in a faster homolysis in the contrary h2o2 will react with oh to produce hydroperoxyl ions ho2 eq 1 under the alkaline condition reducing the available h2o2 39 in addition oh can adsorb on fe iii clusters which could inactivate go mil 101 fe thus the acid condition is more favorable for the mof photocatalysis system 1 h 2 o 2 o h h o 2 h 2 o temperature of reaction solution also affected the reaction efficiency fig s6b high temperature may induce faster reactant transmission and electron transfer resulting in a rapid photocatalysis reaction these high efficiencies under ambient temperature suggested the usability of mof photocatalysis the ratio of h2o2 m vs go mil 101 fe m also had effect on photocatalysis fig s6c an optimal ration at 11 3 was observed raising the h2o2 concentration can provide more oxidant donors for oh however when excessive h2o2 is added the recombination of oh would be enhanced reducing the utilization of h2o2 anions in natural water bodies also have potential inhibition three anions including cl no3 and so4 2 were tested fig 3d these anions absorb 254 nm uv significantly but not shortwave visible light table s3 thus their effects on the current 420 nm photocatalysis system can be attributed to oh quenching cl has a 109 level reaction rate constant with oh table s2 thus cl presented a critical inhibition on photocatalysis in the contrary no3 and so4 2 have slower reaction rates with oh therefore they only had slight inhibitions 3 3 degradation kinetics and mechanism in the 420 nm mil 101 fe h2o2 system a s shape pattern including two stages was observed for tcep degradation fig 4 a first the slow degradation stage lasted 20 min which was the induction period it was observed in some heterogeneous photocatalysis reactions based on fe based catalysts 40 41 this period could be the time of catalyst activation 42 it also can be attributed to the time for the adsorption of reactants onto catalysts 41 the later stage seemed to be a radical oxidation stage following a pseudo first order kinetic for the 420 nm go mil 101 fe h2o2 system the degradation of tcep followed pseudo first order kinetics without an induction period since there is no induction period in the photocatalysis reaction using go mil 101 fe it had a higher degradation efficiency for example tcep removal reached 95 with go mil 101 fe at 30 min while it reached 50 using mil 101 fe based on fitting calculation apparent rate constants k obs under different conditions are presented in figs 3 and s6 in the control system 20 0 mw cm 2 420 nm h2o2 0 at 165 mm tcep 0 at 3 51 μm go mil 101 fe m at 0 5 g l 1 go composite ratio 15 k obs reached 1 64 10 3 s 1 this enhanced degradation using go mil 101 fe could be attributed to the high generation and separation rate of charge carriers electrons and holes after compositing go sheets when light irradiation activates some sites in the go mil 101 fe electrons transfer from oxygen orbitals homo to metal cluster lumo herein go became the highway for the transfer of electrons to other sites of go mil 101 fe this phenomenon enhances the virtual separation efficiency of photogenerated electron hole pairs which can induce catalysis of h2o2 into oh the activation procedure of go mil 101 fe was accelerated thus the induction period and s shape pattern were absent in 420 nm go mil 101 fe h2o2 reaction of note the optimized k obs was 1 64 10 3 s 1 in the current study which was lower than that at 5 38 10 3 s 1 in a uv tio2 system 254 nm 5 6 mw cm 2 70 mg l 1 43 considering that normal tio2 cannot be activated by visible light the current 420 nm go mil 101 fe h2o2 system with k obs at 1 64 10 3 s 1 is still a promising method for tcep removal using accessible solar light to identify the predominant mechanism during go mil 101 fe photocatalysis several scavengers were added 10 mm ascorbic acid had a significant effect as ascorbic acid can quench most oxidants this inhibition indicated that oxidation was the dominant mechanism after adding etoh and tba similar inhibition was observed etoh and tba both react with oh rapidly k at 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 and 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 respectively suggesting the existence of oh here epr was applied to determine the evolution of oh using dmpo as the trapping agent as presented in fig 4b oh was produced in the 420 nm go mil 101 fe h2o2 system and no other evident radical was observed indicating that oh radicals were the dominant oxidative species the intensity variation of oh is presented in fig 4c and slow increases were observed in mil 101 fe h2o2 and go mil 101 fe h2o2 systems suggesting that a weak fenton like reaction may occur in these two systems for 420 nm mil 101 fe h2o2 system the generation of oh followed a slow fast pattern which was consistent with the degradation pattern of tcep in this system of note the intensity of oh increased rapidly within 20 min in the 420 nm go mil 101 fe h2o2 system suggesting that 420 nm irradiation and go compositing significantly enhanced the oh generation and reaction efficiency 3 4 degradation products and pathways since the predominant reaction mechanism in this mof photocatalysis system was confirmed to be oh oxidation the degradation pathway of tcep can be speculated eleven candidates were proposed fig s7 after the product identification procedure text s1 five products were confirmed fig 5 the extracted ion chromatograms eics and ms2 chromatograms fragment data are showed in figs s8 and s9 during the product identification the structure comparison was the most important step which was conducted based on ms2 fragments in order to reveal the detailed procedure of product identification product c c6h13cl2o5p m z 266 995 was chosen as the example products ions of m z 266 995 included m z 222 96 184 89 160 98 125 00 98 98 and 63 00 fig s10 which reflected the sequential loss of c2h4o 44 da c2h4cl 62 da hcl 35 da respectively the fragments with m z 98 98 and 63 00 corresponded to the phosphate backbone and po2 therefore the product m z 266 995 was evaluated to be c6h13cl2o5p fig s10 identification of other products followed a similar procedure the predominant transformation mechanism may include cleavage hydroxylation carbonylation and carboxylation of tcep induced by oh fig 5 both bond energy level and chemical structure of tcep can have impact on the reaction pathways since the co bond is relative stable oh may tend to attack the α carbon adjacent to co bond after this reaction one oxygen ethyl chlorine arm can be separated from tcep to generate product a fig 5b nucleophilic reaction 1 further degradation of product a formed product b ccl bonds were also susceptible to oh attack and the hydroxyl addition reaction occurred to generate hydroxylation products product c fig 5c nucleophilic reaction 2 further oxidation of product c resulted in carbonylation product product d and carboxylation product product e theoretically continuous oxidation of these observed products would generate a series of hydroxylation carbonylation and carboxylation products on multiple oxygen ethyl chlorine arms fig s7 whereas they were absent herein this may be due to their low yields or low concentrations resulting in their absences in hrms data fig s11 shows the relative intensity variation of degradation products the intensity of product a increased during the initial 30 min product b kept a very low intensity during 120 min reaction furthermore products c d and e had their maximum intensities at 30 min 30 min and 40 min respectively indicating that product e was the further transformation product product c maintained at a low level which may be due to its low yields and rapid further transformation to other products although the data about small molecular products such as formic acid and acetic acid are not presented the further degradation of these products will finally result in a mineralization of tcep this was confirmed by the toc data with a 68 removal after 120 min reaction fig s11c 3 5 recyclability and stability recyclability and stability of go mil 101 fe during mof photocatalysis reaction were evaluated fig 6 a ten times repetitive experiment was performed the degradation efficiencies were maintained 99 within 120 min in every repetition and the repetitive curves tended to follow a similar pattern after 3 times recyclability thus only the first three repetitions are presented in fig 6a in 60 min reaction 95 tcep was eliminated in each cycle suggesting a stable recyclability of go mil 101 fe releasing total iron ion including fe3 and fe2 was applied to evaluate go mil 101 fe decomposition in acid water matrix ph 3 00 fig 6b generally go mil 101 fe released 0 36 mg l 1 in deionized water after 120 min reaction the total release of iron ion only contributed 0 07 to the total catalyst addition suggesting a high stability of go mil 101 fe in deionized water this slight release of iron ion can result in a weak fenton like reaction which was observed by the variation of oh relative intensity fig 4a and c the ft ir and xrd of go mil 101 fe before and after the repetitive experiment were investigated fig 6c and d characteristic peaks in ft ir and xrd were retained further indicating a high stability of go mil 101 fe 4 conclusions synthesized go mil 101 fe presented a lower band gap energy 2 17 ev than its parent mil 101 fe under optimized reaction conditions typically 420 nm 20 mw cm 2 ph 3 go mil 101 fe vs h2o2 mass ratio 11 3 degradation of tcep in go mil 101 fe photocatalysis system followed pseudo first order kinetics with a k obs at 1 64 10 3 s 1 the high conductibility of go induced faster activation and electron transfer in go mil 101 fe resulting in a higher removal efficiency of tcep 95 at 30 min than using mil 101 fe 50 the reaction mechanism involved a fast excitation of electrons from oxygen orbitals in ligands to fe ii fe iii induced by visible light irradiation 400 570 nm followed by the electron transport between the mof interface and h2o2 cleavage of h2o2 generated reactive oh for the degradation of tcep furthermore go mil 101 fe released 1 iron ions mass ratio during photocatalysis reaction in deionized water suggesting that go mil 101 fe was steady in water matrixes generally go mil 101 fe photocatalysis with enhanced performance would be a potential elimination method for organic contaminants in water declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this project was supported by

14128,metal organic frameworks mofs have become one of the most attractive classes of materials due to their versatile features it is desirable to evaluate the photocatalysis performance of mofs in aquatic medium in this study graphene oxide compositing mil 101 fe go mil 101 fe was fabricated based on this mof a light mof h2o2 photocatalysis system was developed to degrade tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep go mil 101 fe has a lower band gap energy 2 17 ev than mil 101 fe 2 41 ev suggesting an expansion of visible light absorption from 520 nm to 570 nm under 420 nm irradiation removal of tcep under the 15 go mil 101 fe photocatalysis system followed pseudo first order kinetic with a reaction rate constant at 1 64 10 3 s 1 using go mil 101 fe a fast activation and electron transfer was achieved due to the high conductibility of go resulting in a higher removal efficiency of tcep 95 at 30 min than using mil 101 fe 50 the basic reaction mechanism involved the excitation of electrons from homo oxygen orbitals in ligands to lumo fe ii fe iii in core nodes induced by visible light irradiation followed by the electron transport between go mil 101 fe and h2o2 to generate oh go mil 101 fe visible light photocatalysis would be a potential treatment process for organic contaminants keywords radical oxidation metal organic frameworks emerging organic contaminants degradation light emitting diode 1 introduction metal organic frameworks mofs have attracted worldwide scientists and engineers because of their versatile features 1 2 typical mofs are constructed by metal cores and organic ligands through covalent bonds with nearly infinite combinations as a result mofs show extensive potential applications in sort of fields such as catalytic synthesis 3 energy transfer 4 gas storage separation 5 chemical sensing 6 biomedical applications 7 and heterogeneous photocatalysis 8 recently researchers have made more attempt regarding to the mofs based photocatalysis elimination of contaminants in water 9 11 mofs containing iron core fe based mofs can become feasible photocatalysts because of low cost environmentally friendly and photosensitive feature typical fe based mofs are the mil series such as mil 101 12 these structures make fe based mofs a series of photoresponsive porous coordination polymers and light irradiation can induce an electrons excitation and transport between the mof interface and h2o2 or other oxidant donors these processes can generate hydroxyl radicals oh and other radical species which can degrade and even mineralize various organic pollutants 13 thus fe based mofs may become feasible photocatalysts for contaminant elimination whereas the full photocatalysis application of fe based mofs is still obstructed by several weaknesses first poor stability in aqueous mediums is a critical weakness for particular mofs 14 furthermore low quantum yield due to inefficient excitons generation and electron separation also impedes their photocatalytic processes 15 several strategies have been proposed to mitigate these drawbacks combinations with strong chemical bands were used to synthesize steady mofs 16 high valence metals including ti zr fe al and cr were selected to form core nodes and then strong organic acids were used to form the ligands according to pearson s acid base principle these strong acid basic combinations would be more stable in acid and neutral aqueous conditions 17 another approach is compositing mofs with some substrates such as semiconductor nanoparticles 15 18 carbon nanotubes 19 graphene oxide go 20 23 etc composite of go may improve the dispersion of go mofs while the cover of go layer through combinations with epoxy and hydroxyl functional groups onto mof can enhance the firmness of mofs recently polychlorinated and polybrominated flame retardants were banned worldwide therefore organic phosphorous flame retardants opfrs became an alternative flame retardants 24 researchers proposed that opfrs would be a potential environment problem according to their highly persistence and toxicity 25 26 thus it is desirable to develop cost effective technologies for the elimination of these flame retardants to date synthesis of go mofs for photocatalysis is rarely reported 23 27 28 the go mof hybrid materials have shown enhanced stability dispersive forces and photocatalytic efficiency compared to their parent mofs furthermore introducing of go may alter the photochemistry feature of go fe based mofs in the current study go composite mil 101 fe was synthesized and characterized tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep was selected as the targeted contaminant while its degradation efficiency in go mil 101 fe photocatalysis was tested performances between go mil 101 fe and mil 101 fe was compared reaction mechanisms in these systems were investigated while the stability was also evaluated it would be an important aspect for the target application of go fe based mofs as photocatalyst in aquatic mediums 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical materials graphene oxide go 99 1 5 layers layer diameter 2 10 μm single layer thickness 1 nm was obtained from chinese academy of sciences benzene 1 4 dicarboxylic acid h2bdc n n dimethylformamide dmf tcep 98 5 tert butyl alcohol tba and 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine tempo 98 were purchased from tci ethyl alcohol etoh ascorbic acid 99 and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 99 were purchased from sigma analytical grade fecl3 6h2o h2o2 30 nano3 nacl and na2so4 were obtained from sinopharm 2 2 synthesis and characterization of go mil 101 fe a facile fabrication of mil 101 fe and go mil 101 fe were performed by a hydrothermal method for mil 101 fe a typical combination of 0 415 g 2 5 mmol h2bdc and 1 351 g fecl3 6h2o 5 0 mmol were added into 30 ml of dmf and this dmf suspension was under ultrasonic treatment for 15 min the mixture was transferred to a teflon autoclave 120 c 20 h the obtained solid centrifuged and washed by dmf and etoh to eliminate the raw stuff the purified products were dried 70 c 30 min and activated 150 c 10 h for go mil 101 fe after the mixing of h2bdc and fecl3 6h2o into dmf particular amount of go 2 5 10 15 and 20 mass ratios of h2bdc fecl3 6h2o was added into 6 ml etoh the suspension was treated by ultrasonication for 10 min and then these two suspensions were mixed a further 5 min ultrasonication was conducted and then the mixture was transferred to a teflon autoclave 120 c 24 h the purified products were dried at 70 c for 30 min and activated at 150 c for 10 h characterization of these two mofs followed similar methods reported in our previous study 29 2 3 basic photocatalysis experiments a multiple wavelength light emitting diodes leds irradiation device was assembled fig s1 which contained a light source framework and reactor vessel detailed information about the reaction device was reported in our previous study 30 the solution ph was maintained by a naoh kh2po4 and h3po4 mixture buffered solution for one reaction 20 ml solution was applied this solution was shaken orbitally under 60 rpm solid mil 101 fe or go mil 101 fe was added in the reaction solution and a 30 min pre absorption was conducted photocatalytic treatments were begun by turning on the leds and spiking h2o2 solution 30 at given time points 1 0 ml suspension samples were harvested and then equivalent sodium sulfite solution was added to stop the reaction the obtained mixture was filtrated by 0 22 μm polyethersulfone filter 2 4 influence factor and mechanism exploration experiments several influence factors including wavelength go ratio ph temperature h2o2 vs go mil 101 fe mass ratio and inorganic anions concentration at 10 mm were tested by changing the particular factor upon the basic experiment scavenging agents and epr were applied to determine the photocatalytic mechanism in scavenging experiments etoh tba and ascorbic acid all at 100 mm were added for epr dmpo was applied as oh spin trapping agent epr instrument settings were power at 11 52 mw sweep width at 120 g modulation amplitude at 1 00 g time constant at 78 92 ms conversion time at 40 ms resolution in x 1024 and resolution in y 20 40 tempo was applied to be the stable radical standard for spin adducts quantitative analysis the relative intensities of spin adduct were determined by comparing integrated areas of peaks which had the best fit linear regression of tempo 2 5 recyclability and stability experiments during recyclability experiments after the first reaction cycle the used powder was separated by centrifugation and it was washed with 200 ml deionized water after drying the powder was used for further reaction cycle total three cycles were applied for stability experiment the fe3 and fe2 concentrations in the filtrated solution after reactions were determined by an inductive coupled plasma emission spectrometer 2 6 determination of tcep and degradation products quantitative and qualitative determination of tcep and its products were conducted following similar methods reported in our previous study 31 2 7 molar absorption coefficient calculation molar absorption extinction coefficients ε were used to present light absorption capacities of cl no3 and so4 2 the measurement and calculation of ε followed similar methods reported in our previous study 32 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mofs fig 1 a and b show the sem of mil 101 fe and 10 go mil 101 fe figs s2 and s3 present the sem of go 2 5 15 and 20 go mil 101 fe agglomerates flakes of graphene sheets were observed for go of note the agglomerates of mil 101 fe and go mil 101 fe nanocomposite look totally different mil 101 fe consists of regular polyhedron at 1 0 4 0 μm diameter after compositing a small amount 2 of go the hybrid crystal presents a decreasing size 1 0 2 0 μm with a similar polyhedron shape fig s3a as the go ratio increased the crystal size continuously decreased for example the size of 20 go mil 101 fe was approximate 0 5 1 0 μm furthermore some disk shape and other shape crystals were observed figs s3c and s3d suggesting the distortion of mil crystal generation of mil 101 fe can extend in any spatial orientation however the go sheets can restrain the possible generation orientation of mil 101 fe resulting in the smaller and irregular go mil 101 fe crystal as the go ratio increased this phenomenon aggravated similar hypothesis was also proposed during go mil 101 cr synthesis 33 the xrd patterns of go mil 101 fe and go mil 101 fe measured in a range of 2θ from 5 to 40 are presented in fig 1c go show 002 diffraction peak at 2θ 11 1 indicating its amorphous layer structure xrd of original mil 101 fe contained four peaks at 2θ 8 9 9 7 19 6 and 21 7 which was consistent with previous study 34 for 2 go mil 101 fe similar but weaker characteristic peaks were observed however as the go composite ratio increased the peak intensities declined which may be the result of the partial distortion of mil 101 fe 35 of note no diffraction peak at 2θ 11 1 was observed in go mil 101 fe which may be due to the high dispersion of go 14 36 the ft ir of go contained two characteristic peaks at around 1610 and 1720 cm 1 which related to the oxygen functional groups such as co and coh on go surface fig 1d ft ir of mil 101 fe demonstrated a different ft ir pattern and its characteristic peaks were at 750 1020 1396 1583 and 1680 cm 1 fig 1d peak 750 cm 1 may be the ch bond in benzene peaks 1396 cm 1 and 1583 cm 1 could present the carboxyl bond coo peak 1680 cm 1 may originate from co bonds in carboxyl these characteristic peaks were also reported in other literature about mil 101 fe 37 of note variations of characteristic peaks were observed for go mil 101 fe first peak at 1680 cm 1 tended to disappear as the go ratio increased second a blue shift was observed for 1583 cm 1 peak after go was added generation of mil 101 fe was restrained furthermore go surface contained lots of oxygen functional groups which can react with the carboxyl groups coo on mil 101 fe finally generating a series irregular co and or co chains reduction of the amount of co bonds of free carbonyl induced the disappearance of 1680 cm 1 peak the blue shift of peak 1583 cm 1 can be explained by the overlay and interference of the go characteristic peak for other peaks such as 750 1020 and 1396 cm 1 no variation was observed these alterations of ft ir spectroscopy implied the interaction between go and mil 101 fe which may build up electron transfer efficiency the addition of go can also alter the characteristic absorption spectrum of mofs uv vis drs was applied to identify the photochemical properties of go mil 101 fe and go mil 101 fe fig 1e for go no reflection was observed in the range of 200 850 nm for mil 101 fe high light reflectance in the range of 550 850 nm was observed after adding go the reflectance in this range gradually declined implying a visible light absorption band gap energy e g was applied for the investigation of photo utilization fig 1f calculation of band gap energy e g followed a reported method 38 mil 101 fe has e g at 2 41 ev implying that light irradiation 520 nm can activate the electron transports of mil 101 fe for go mil 101 fe with go addition e g was calculated to be around 2 17 ev 570 nm suggesting an expansion of absorption wavelength this decreasing bandgap can be attributed to the improvement of electrical conductibility by go after go was composited with mil 101 fe its impaired conductive network with abundant π electrons was connected onto mil 101 fe surface providing a highway for electron transfer of note uv irradiation can be easily screened by various natural organic matter and anions diffuse in the natural water bodies but it is not true for visible light thus the bandgap expansion implied that the utilization efficiency of light sources was improved for go mil 101 fe photocatalysis system in actual water treatment the xps spectra of go mil 101 fe are measured fig 2 first survey spectrum indicated it contained c o and fe elements as shown in fig 2b the c1s spectrum could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 284 6 286 0 and 288 5 ev these peaks could be attributed to carbon atoms bond cc and carbon organic linkers co and oco in go mil 101 fe respectively the o1s peak also can be divided into three peaks at 530 2 531 7 and 533 1 ev corresponding to the oxygen atoms in the feo bonds co linkers and co linkers of go mil 101 fe respectively fig 2c for the xps spectrum of fe2p fig 2d two strong peaks at 724 9 ev and 711 8 ev were attributed to fe2p1 2 and fe2p3 2 respectively which suggested that fo bonds were presented in go mil 101 fe these xps spectra as well as the sem xrd ft ir indicated the successful synthesis of go mil 101 fe 3 2 basic performance and influence factors several control experiments were conducted first adsorption and h2o2 oxidation were considered fig s4 sole go adsorption and sole h2o2 oxidation had little effect on tcep but mil 101 fe and go mil 101 fe both had 20 adsorption with an equilibrium in 30 min therefore in the subsequent experiments a 30 min pre adsorption was conducted sole light irradiation cannot degrade tcep directly fig s5a for light h2o2 treatments only 280 nm h2o2 can degrade tcep fig s5b uv c induced cleavage of h2o2 to generate oh which contributed to the degradation of tcep light mil 101 fe and light go mil 101 fe contributed no decrease of tcep figs s5c s5d although some wavelength photons can activate these two mofs to an excitation state the absence of oxidant donor may result in the rapid recombination of electrons and holes in mofs go h2o2 mil 101 fe h2o2 and go mil 101 fe h2o2 were tested figs s6 and 3a the go h2o2 seemed to have a negligible removal after 120 min reaction 20 tcep was removed by mil 101 fe h2o2 go mil 101 fe h2o2 presented a rapid degradation of tcep approximate 80 tcep was removed within 120 min indicating that go mil 101 fe may induce a transformation of h2o2 into oh higher removal efficiencies were observed in light go mil 101 fe h2o2 systems go composite ratio 15 fig 3 a in the subsequent experiment it was called mof photocatalysis system for short irradiation with different wavelengths demonstrated distinct degradation efficiencies compared to the go mil 101 fe h2o2 system activation by long wave visible light 587 and 625 nm had little effect but shorter wave visible irradiation 420 492 and 535 nm had significant improvements the mof photocatalysis system with 420 nm presented the highest efficiency with a removal up to 95 within 30 min go mil 101 fe has a band gap at 570 nm section 3 1 thus 420 492 and 535 nm visible light and uv can be absorbed and utilized resulting in a fast activation of go mil 101 fe and faster electron transport in the presence of h2o2 the enhanced photocatalysis reaction was achieved irradiation higher than 570 nm cannot be utilized by go mil 101 fe considering that uv irradiation is susceptible to impurities in natural water mof photocatalysis systems with short wave visible light especially 420 nm were more applicable go composite ratio had a significant effect on photocatalysis performance fig 3b mil 101 fe can be considered as the one contained no go compositing the degradation curve of the 420 nm mil 101 fe h2o2 system demonstrated a slow decreasing stage before 20 min with a removal of tcep at 8 and then a rapid degradation stage was observed within 20 120 nm as composite ratio increased the degradation efficiency increased and reached a peak value with composite ratio at 15 go compositing can enhance separation of the photogenerated electron hole pairs and the electron transformation efficiency approximate 95 tcep was degraded in the 15 go mil 101 fe photocatalysis system at 30 min however when the go composite ratio increased to a higher level 20 excessive amount of go layer can cover most surface of mil 101 fe affecting the adsorption and mass transfer capacities of go mil 101 fe of note the variation curve in go mil 101 fe photocatalysis presented a continuous degradation pattern without the initial slow stage implying a different reaction mechanism compared to mil 101 fe in the subsequent experiments 15 go mil 101 fe and 420 nm were applied variation of initial ph value had a significant effect fig 3c a fastest degradation rate was achieved at ph 3 00 after ph grew to 5 00 tcep degradation followed a slower rate with a similar pattern when ph continuously increased negligible removal of tcep was confirmed under the acid condition the abundant h in solution induced the protonation and positive charging on the mof surface this was benefit to h2o2 attraction resulting in a faster homolysis in the contrary h2o2 will react with oh to produce hydroperoxyl ions ho2 eq 1 under the alkaline condition reducing the available h2o2 39 in addition oh can adsorb on fe iii clusters which could inactivate go mil 101 fe thus the acid condition is more favorable for the mof photocatalysis system 1 h 2 o 2 o h h o 2 h 2 o temperature of reaction solution also affected the reaction efficiency fig s6b high temperature may induce faster reactant transmission and electron transfer resulting in a rapid photocatalysis reaction these high efficiencies under ambient temperature suggested the usability of mof photocatalysis the ratio of h2o2 m vs go mil 101 fe m also had effect on photocatalysis fig s6c an optimal ration at 11 3 was observed raising the h2o2 concentration can provide more oxidant donors for oh however when excessive h2o2 is added the recombination of oh would be enhanced reducing the utilization of h2o2 anions in natural water bodies also have potential inhibition three anions including cl no3 and so4 2 were tested fig 3d these anions absorb 254 nm uv significantly but not shortwave visible light table s3 thus their effects on the current 420 nm photocatalysis system can be attributed to oh quenching cl has a 109 level reaction rate constant with oh table s2 thus cl presented a critical inhibition on photocatalysis in the contrary no3 and so4 2 have slower reaction rates with oh therefore they only had slight inhibitions 3 3 degradation kinetics and mechanism in the 420 nm mil 101 fe h2o2 system a s shape pattern including two stages was observed for tcep degradation fig 4 a first the slow degradation stage lasted 20 min which was the induction period it was observed in some heterogeneous photocatalysis reactions based on fe based catalysts 40 41 this period could be the time of catalyst activation 42 it also can be attributed to the time for the adsorption of reactants onto catalysts 41 the later stage seemed to be a radical oxidation stage following a pseudo first order kinetic for the 420 nm go mil 101 fe h2o2 system the degradation of tcep followed pseudo first order kinetics without an induction period since there is no induction period in the photocatalysis reaction using go mil 101 fe it had a higher degradation efficiency for example tcep removal reached 95 with go mil 101 fe at 30 min while it reached 50 using mil 101 fe based on fitting calculation apparent rate constants k obs under different conditions are presented in figs 3 and s6 in the control system 20 0 mw cm 2 420 nm h2o2 0 at 165 mm tcep 0 at 3 51 μm go mil 101 fe m at 0 5 g l 1 go composite ratio 15 k obs reached 1 64 10 3 s 1 this enhanced degradation using go mil 101 fe could be attributed to the high generation and separation rate of charge carriers electrons and holes after compositing go sheets when light irradiation activates some sites in the go mil 101 fe electrons transfer from oxygen orbitals homo to metal cluster lumo herein go became the highway for the transfer of electrons to other sites of go mil 101 fe this phenomenon enhances the virtual separation efficiency of photogenerated electron hole pairs which can induce catalysis of h2o2 into oh the activation procedure of go mil 101 fe was accelerated thus the induction period and s shape pattern were absent in 420 nm go mil 101 fe h2o2 reaction of note the optimized k obs was 1 64 10 3 s 1 in the current study which was lower than that at 5 38 10 3 s 1 in a uv tio2 system 254 nm 5 6 mw cm 2 70 mg l 1 43 considering that normal tio2 cannot be activated by visible light the current 420 nm go mil 101 fe h2o2 system with k obs at 1 64 10 3 s 1 is still a promising method for tcep removal using accessible solar light to identify the predominant mechanism during go mil 101 fe photocatalysis several scavengers were added 10 mm ascorbic acid had a significant effect as ascorbic acid can quench most oxidants this inhibition indicated that oxidation was the dominant mechanism after adding etoh and tba similar inhibition was observed etoh and tba both react with oh rapidly k at 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 and 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 respectively suggesting the existence of oh here epr was applied to determine the evolution of oh using dmpo as the trapping agent as presented in fig 4b oh was produced in the 420 nm go mil 101 fe h2o2 system and no other evident radical was observed indicating that oh radicals were the dominant oxidative species the intensity variation of oh is presented in fig 4c and slow increases were observed in mil 101 fe h2o2 and go mil 101 fe h2o2 systems suggesting that a weak fenton like reaction may occur in these two systems for 420 nm mil 101 fe h2o2 system the generation of oh followed a slow fast pattern which was consistent with the degradation pattern of tcep in this system of note the intensity of oh increased rapidly within 20 min in the 420 nm go mil 101 fe h2o2 system suggesting that 420 nm irradiation and go compositing significantly enhanced the oh generation and reaction efficiency 3 4 degradation products and pathways since the predominant reaction mechanism in this mof photocatalysis system was confirmed to be oh oxidation the degradation pathway of tcep can be speculated eleven candidates were proposed fig s7 after the product identification procedure text s1 five products were confirmed fig 5 the extracted ion chromatograms eics and ms2 chromatograms fragment data are showed in figs s8 and s9 during the product identification the structure comparison was the most important step which was conducted based on ms2 fragments in order to reveal the detailed procedure of product identification product c c6h13cl2o5p m z 266 995 was chosen as the example products ions of m z 266 995 included m z 222 96 184 89 160 98 125 00 98 98 and 63 00 fig s10 which reflected the sequential loss of c2h4o 44 da c2h4cl 62 da hcl 35 da respectively the fragments with m z 98 98 and 63 00 corresponded to the phosphate backbone and po2 therefore the product m z 266 995 was evaluated to be c6h13cl2o5p fig s10 identification of other products followed a similar procedure the predominant transformation mechanism may include cleavage hydroxylation carbonylation and carboxylation of tcep induced by oh fig 5 both bond energy level and chemical structure of tcep can have impact on the reaction pathways since the co bond is relative stable oh may tend to attack the α carbon adjacent to co bond after this reaction one oxygen ethyl chlorine arm can be separated from tcep to generate product a fig 5b nucleophilic reaction 1 further degradation of product a formed product b ccl bonds were also susceptible to oh attack and the hydroxyl addition reaction occurred to generate hydroxylation products product c fig 5c nucleophilic reaction 2 further oxidation of product c resulted in carbonylation product product d and carboxylation product product e theoretically continuous oxidation of these observed products would generate a series of hydroxylation carbonylation and carboxylation products on multiple oxygen ethyl chlorine arms fig s7 whereas they were absent herein this may be due to their low yields or low concentrations resulting in their absences in hrms data fig s11 shows the relative intensity variation of degradation products the intensity of product a increased during the initial 30 min product b kept a very low intensity during 120 min reaction furthermore products c d and e had their maximum intensities at 30 min 30 min and 40 min respectively indicating that product e was the further transformation product product c maintained at a low level which may be due to its low yields and rapid further transformation to other products although the data about small molecular products such as formic acid and acetic acid are not presented the further degradation of these products will finally result in a mineralization of tcep this was confirmed by the toc data with a 68 removal after 120 min reaction fig s11c 3 5 recyclability and stability recyclability and stability of go mil 101 fe during mof photocatalysis reaction were evaluated fig 6 a ten times repetitive experiment was performed the degradation efficiencies were maintained 99 within 120 min in every repetition and the repetitive curves tended to follow a similar pattern after 3 times recyclability thus only the first three repetitions are presented in fig 6a in 60 min reaction 95 tcep was eliminated in each cycle

mil 101 fe released 0 36 mg l 1 in deionized water after 120 min reaction the total release of iron ion only contributed 0 07 to the total catalyst addition suggesting a high stability of go mil 101 fe in deionized water this slight release of iron ion can result in a weak fenton like reaction which was observed by the variation of oh relative intensity fig 4a and c the ft ir and xrd of go mil 101 fe before and after the repetitive experiment were investigated fig 6c and d characteristic peaks in ft ir and xrd were retained further indicating a high stability of go mil 101 fe 4 conclusions

3 degradation of tcep in go mil 101 fe photocatalysis system followed pseudo first order kinetics with a k obs at 1 64 10 3 s 1 the high conductibility of go induced faster activation and electron transfer in go mil 101 fe resulting in a higher removal efficiency of tcep 95 at 30 min than using mil 101 fe 50 the reaction mechanism involved a fast excitation of electrons from oxygen orbitals in ligands to fe ii fe iii induced by visible light irradiation 400 570 nm followed by the electron transport between the mof interface and h2o2 cleavage of h2o2 generated reactive oh for the degradation of tcep furthermore go mil 101 fe released 1 iron ions mass ratio during photocatalysis reaction in deionized water suggesting that go mil 101 fe was steady in water matrixes generally go mil 101 fe

14129,the removal efficiency of diclofenac and ketoprofen for five fungal strains was examined the synergistic effect between selected fungal strains using synthetic wastewater media was studied using both individual and mixed strains the mixed cultures had no additional effect in reducing diclofenac and ketoprofen in contrary fungi removed pharmaceutical substances faster when growing individually the results showed that t versicolor monoculture removed diclofenac completely 99 9 in non sterile municipal wastewater within three hours of incubation and continued to show complete reduction within 14 days using fungal biofilm carriers the mechanism of removal was proposed based on the laccase enzyme production and biosorption study which revealed that t versicolor could used in both processes additionally this study demonstrated that t versicolor could be stable in the biofilm carriers and thus able to compete with other microorganisms in wastewater to be a promising candidate to remove diclofenac from municipal wastewater during the treatment process keywords fungal treatment wastewater diclofenac ketoprofen carriers 1 introduction over the last few decades the widespread occurrence of hazardous substances such as pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides and endocrine disrupting chemicals in the aquatic environment has been recognized as an emerging environmental issue as it can cause undesirable effects on the ecosystem and human health 1 2 the main source of these compounds is effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants the conventional treatment plant is commonly designed to remove high concentrations mostly biodegradable organic matter and nutrients using mainly bacteria 3 4 thus most of the hazardous substances are not effectively removed 5 6 consequently may have negative effects on human health and aquatic ecosystem 7 for instance extensive use of antibiotics and antimicrobial agents can result in development of antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria 2 furthermore a previous study has demonstrated that diclofenac has negative effect on marine organisms such as mussels 8 although advanced treatment technologies such as ozonation advanced oxidation membrane processes and adsorption by activated carbon are considered as a promising alternative to remove hazardous substances from wastewater 9 high operating costs and formation of by products are still limiting factors to implement the advanced treatment technologies as alternative to an effective wastewater treatment process 10 therefore fungi have been considered as a promising alternative to advanced treatment methods to remove hazardous substances from wastewater 11 fungi can use hazardous substances as a secondary substrate due to their ability to produce nonspecific enzymes e g ligninolytic extracellular oxidative enzymes which are able to degrade a wide range of hazardous substances even at very low concentrations 1 5 12 13 previous studies have shown that it is attainable to achieve high removal efficiency applying biodegradation of many hazardous compounds for instance fusarium solani was able to degrade the emerging water pollutants like di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp fluoranthene and aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa in a batch scale experiment in a synthetic media for fungi 14 likewise several studies have demonstrated high removal efficiency of hazardous compounds as progesterone atenolol ibuprofen diclofenac and ketoprofen by trametes versicolor pleurotus ostreatus trichoderma reesei and irpex lacteus 15 18 in laboratory scale experiments under sterile conditions based on these investigations it has been proposed that these fungi might be suitable candidates to remove hazardous substances however most of experiments with fungal cultures both in batch and continuous reactors for hazardous substances removal have been tested by individual strains and cultured in specific nutrient media or synthetic wastewater 19 therefore there are still many unanswered questions regarding a full scale application of fungi in the wastewater treatment process one of the questions is how the use of fungal culture could affect the removal efficiency of hazardous substances and how it would compete with other microorganisms under non sterile conditions moreover the operating conditions might play a key role especially on enzyme activity for instance previous studies have demonstrated that the use of biofilm carriers not only improve fungal growth and production of enzyme activity but also increase the removal efficiency of hazardous substances 20 22 thus further research is needed to determine if the approach using fungi can be applied for the wastewater treatment process in order to better understand their ability to grow produce enzymes and remove hazardous substances in municipal wastewater under non sterile conditions the main objective of this study was to investigate the potential of five worldwide distributed fungal strains t versicolor i lacteus p ostreatus t reesei and f solani to remove hazardous substances from municipal wastewater under non sterile conditions in this work the ph level the effect of carriers the removal efficiency and the enzymatic laccase activity were examined for each strain separately and in mixed cultures in batch scale experiments for a certain period of time to the best of our knowledge this is the first study where the synergetic effects have been tested furthermore the effect of non sterile municipal wastewater using fungal biofilm carriers k1 with the most promising strains was tested to assess the potential of fungal treatment to remove hazardous substances additionally the difference of initial inoculum for fungal cultures was analyzed in order to determine the removal efficiency in non sterile wastewater finally the biosorption experiment was done to better understand fungal removal mechanisms for pharmaceutical substances 2 materials

wastewater media was poured into dishes after inoculation fungi were incubated at 25 c for 14 days the fungal growth and interaction inhibition or antagonistic activity among strains were estimated qualitatively by taking images of mycelia and interaction zone on the agar plate with digital photo camera kodak usa 2 5 removal of diclofenac and ketoprofen by fungal strains in a synthetic wastewater medium the removal of pharmaceutical substances by fungal strains was evaluated under sterile conditions using 100 ml flasks glass bottles glassco united kingdom filled with 25 ml of

25 ml of inlet wastewater pharmaceutical substances the final concentration of 5 mg l 1 of selected chemical and 100 μl of fungal suspension the fungal suspension was prepared on a pd agar plate after

a t test two tailed distribution significance level 0 05 and a data analysis ms excel 2013 was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth effect of selected fungal strains during the initial study the growth and interaction of selected fungal strains were tested by a classical cultivation method with and without pharmaceutical substances the combinations of fungi were selected based on the previous study 26 where these fungi demonstrated the most appropriate ability to grow in a sterile wastewater agar media in this study diclofenac and ketoprofen were selected as model compounds due to high levels of consumption in various european countries and their appearance in the wastewater treatment plant effluents 27 furthermore these compounds contain different functional groups that might provide a new insight into the removal efficiency by fungi the results indicated that all fungal strains could grow in the presence of pharmaceuticals similar to control strains without pharmaceutical substances supplementary fig s1 when the cultures grown together the formation of the inhibition zone among the tested strains was observed fig 1 for instance results of the interaction test demonstrated an inhibition zone formation among of t reesei i lacteus and t versicolor fig 1a the same was observed in the case of f solani and p ostreatus strains fig 1b hence it would be an interest of the research to find out whether these fungal strains could remove pharmaceutical substances by applying mixed cultures or culturing them individually in liquid media of synthetic wastewater the fungal strains of t reesei t versicolor i lacteus f solani and p ostreatus were investigated in the individual experiment to test their capability to remove ketoprofen and diclofenac in a synthetic wastewater medium although previous studies have shown that the maximum concentrations of diclofenac and ketoprofen in municipal wastewater vary from 0 44 to7 1 μg l 1 for diclofenac and 0 004 to 8 56 μg l 1 for ketoprofen 10 28 relatively higher concentrations e g mg l 1 of these substances can be found in the industrial wastewater and can be acknowledged as a potential ecological risk 29 therefore the concentration of 5 mg l 1 was selected and investigated for both substances the results showed that only t versicolor was able to reduce more than 80 of ketoprofen after 21 days of incubation while other fungal strains did not indicate any reduction of ketoprofen after 7 days of incubation fig 2 a furthermore results from the individual experiment of t reseei i lacteus f solani and p ostreatus showed an increase of ketoprofen concentration fig 2a for instance the hplc peak profile of the t reseei has shown a double peak formation close to the control peak after 21 days of incubation which presumably has caused misleading calculated results of the analyzed substance s removal supplementary fig 2a these results may indicate the formation of by products from the degraded chemical compounds as described earlier 14 30 therefore the analytical method to analyze by products with the hplc system needs to be improved in additional studies in contrast to ketoprofen fungal strains of t versicolor i lacteus and p ostreatus showed a higher removal efficiency of diclofenac for instance the results derived from the individual experiment of t versicolor i lacteus and p ostreatus have shown the ability to remove more than 80 of diclofenac while f solani and t reseei were able to remove only 40 of diclofenac within 7 days of incubation fig 2b however a longer incubation period of f solani indicated a maximum reduction of 90 of diclofenac on day 21 while t reseei demonstrated significantly the same concentration as of the beginning of this experiment as the hplc peak profile of t reseei did not demonstrate any extra peak formation supplementary fig 2b it has been observed that this strain started to release this compound back to synthetic wastewater after 3 days of incubation it might be explain by the sorption as the strategy for pharmaceutical substance removal 31 overall the obtained results of the individual cultures showed that selected strains especially t versicolor i lacteus p ostreatus and f solani are promising candidates for ketoprofen and diclofenac removal therefore the synergetic effect of fungi was investigated in the further study 3 2 synergistic effect of selected fungal strains the synergetic effect of mixed cultures from t reesei in combination with i lacteus and t versicolor was investigated when t reesei in the mix with i lacteus and t versicolor was cultivated for 3 days the reduction of ketoprofen and diclofenac was observed fig 3 for example t reesei in the mix with i lacteus demonstrated up to 60 reduction of both pharmaceutical substances after 3 days of incubation however results of the hplc analysis for a longer incubation period of t reesei in the mix with i lacteus and t versicolor did not show any chemical compound reduction furthermore results of the hplc peak profile from a mixed experiment of t reesei combined with i lacteus and t versicolor after 7 days of incubation demonstrated an extra hplc peak formation causing an increase in the concentration of ketoprofen supplementary fig s3 it might be explained by fungal cell surface sorption as hazardous substances occur due to physicochemical interaction between the substance and the functional groups which are present on the fungal cell surface this type of biosorption is relatively rapid and can be reversible 32 the fig 3 presents the ketoprofen and diclofenac removal results using i lacteus in the combination with t versicolor i lacteus in a combination with t versicolor were able to reduce ketoprofen for more than 50 after 3 days of incubation until the end of the incubation period of 14 days fig 3a furthermore after 14 days of incubation based on the individual combination of i lacteus the results have shown a 25 removal rate of ketoprofen while t versicolor could remove up to 40 of the substance thus the removal efficiency in a mixed culture with t versicolor and i lacteus was relatively higher compared to individual cultures figs 2a and 3 a on the contrary the combination of i lacteus and t versicolor was able to completely 99 9 remove diclofenac concentration after 7 days of incubation fig 3b results showed that there was no statistically significant difference p 0 05 between removal efficiency if the fungi were grown separately or when compared to the mixed cultures figs 2b and 3 b for instance after 7 days of individual incubation of i lacteus and t versicolor they demonstrated more than 90 removal of diclofenac furthermore in all three combinations the analysis of the hplc did not display any extra peak formation comparing to the control hplc peak of diclofenac therefore results from mixed cultures had no extra effect in reducing diclofenac in the sample furthermore the results of the mixed experiment of t reesei in a combination with i lacteus and t versicolor demonstrated a negative synergetic effect in removing diclofenac and ketoprofen using t reesei on i lacteus and t versicolor for instance the combination of i lacteus and t versicolor completely removed 99 9 diclofenac while t reesei in the combination with t versicolor and or i lacteus was not able to remove more than 20 of diclofenac after 14 days of incubation fig 3b the synergistic relationship effect of removing ketoprofen and diclofenac between f solani and p ostreatus was also investigated see fig 3a and b these strains were mixed together based on the previous study 26 where both tested cultures separately demonstrated a slower growth rate in a sterile wastewater agar media comparing to t reesei i lacteus and t versicolor the results of ketoprofen reduction results using mixed cultures of f solani and p ostreatus demonstrated a similar tendency as previously derived results i e there was a difficulty with the ketoprofen analysis utilizing the hplc technique for instance all samples demonstrated an increase of ketoprofen while the reduction was observed only for an individual bioassay of p ostreatus after 21 days of incubation see figs 2a and 3 a on the contrary the combination of f solani and p ostreatus showed 90 removal of diclofenac after 14 days of incubation fig 3b furthermore the results from individual p ostreatus culture demonstrated a faster removal efficiency of diclofenac this compound was 99 9 removed after 14 days of incubation comparing with the mixed cultures where 80 of diclofenac was removed after 14 days of incubation figs 2b and 3 b overall the results of the synergistic study demonstrated the ability to remove pharmaceutical substances with fungal strains in most cases the results showed that fungi can remove pharmaceutical substances faster if they grow individually the possible reason to reduce pharmaceutical substances in mixed cultures may be due to the competition and growth inhibition between the fungal strains as observed in this study fig 1 fig 1 shows that the growth of mixed fungal cultures can visibly observed on an agar plate emphasizing the inhibition of growth though t reesei out compete the growth against i lacteus and t vesicolor the reduction of pharmaceutical substances was lower compared to the i lacteus and t versicolor mixed culture there was an inhibition zone observed around i lacteus and t vesicolor mixed cultures of f solani and p ostreatus showed a difference at the meeting zone of these two cultures this might cause an effect in reducing pharmaceutical substances therefore further experiments were focused on individual species rather than mixed the removal of pharmaceutical substances by fungal strains varies widely from one compound to another yang et al 6 have stated that physicochemical properties of the target molecules appear to be a key reason for such variation for instance some hazardous substances are easily biosorbed due to their high hydrophobicity some have molecular features that render them readily biodegradable by fungi while others are resistant to the fungi enzyme system due to certain features of their molecular structure 6 for instance ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug which belongs to the substituted 2 phenyl propionic acids group 24 its structural formula demonstrates functional groups of methyl keton and carboxylic acid group table 1 the presence of electron withdrawing functional groups such as amide conr2 halogen x nitro no2 and carboxylic cooh group generates an electron deficiency and thus renders the compounds less susceptible to oxidative catabolism 6 therefore the appearance of the carboxylic acid group in the ketoprofen structure might explain the difficulties to remove this compound for investigated fungal strains for instance previous studies have shown that ketoprofen is not completely removed in most cases of wastewater treatment 33 additionally palli et al 16 have demonstrated that heat killed biomass of t versicolor can remove only 15 of ketoprofen moreover marco urrea et al 15 proved that the enzyme system of t versicolor is not involved in ketoprofen degradation therefore the removal of ketoprofen required further investigation in contrast to ketoprofen which has functional groups of methyl keton and carboxylic acid groups diclofenac is an anti inflammatory drug with one functional group hydroxyl the hydroxyl group has been reported as the first electron donating group for diclofenac 6 therefore diclofenac can be efficiently degraded by a fungal treatment furthermore several studies have presented similar results of diclofenac removal by t versicol and i lacteus 1 6 for instance lucas et al 1 have demonstrated high removal efficiency of diclofenac by t versicolor and i lacteus in batch experiments indicating the contribution of the sorption processes however most of these studies have been conducted on an autoclaved soil or on a synthetic media 1 34 in this study the laccase enzyme activity was measured to better understand the relationship between the enzyme activity and the reduction of diclofenac the activity of the laccase enzyme was observed only when fungi were incubated separately supplementary table s1 therefore the results of the interaction tests and laccase activity confirm the assumption that the fungal strains are able to remove diclofenac with a higher degree of efficiency if they are incubated separately and are not mixed this might be explained by fungal interaction with each other on enzyme production however further investigation has to be carried out the obtained results are similar and comparable with the results from the previous study conducted by vasiliadou et al 18 the study examined the efficiency of two white rot fungi t versicolor and g lucidum vasiliadou et al 18 demonstrated the simultaneous use of both strains indicating a significant decrease in removal efficiencies of tested hazardous substances e g carbamazepine and sulpiride therefore the individual growth strategy to remove pharmaceutical compounds does not only exclude competition and inhibition among the strains but also increases the efficiency of pharmaceutical substances removal mechanisms e g extracellular enzyme production for compound degradation furthermore the effect of the ph level might also play an important role in terms of the fungal metabolisms activity to produce enzymes and affect the morphology of the fungal cell structure 35 therefore the ph was monitored during the incubation time however measuring the ph level in all samples no changes were observed during the incubation time data not shown the results from this study have demonstrated the potential to remove diclofenac efficiently and successfully under sterile conditions by selected fungi however results could not be as significant as they would be if fungi would be grown under real wastewater conditions with the variable microbial community in municipal wastewater 36 for this reason in the further work the capability to remove diclofenac in non sterile municipal wastewater by the selected fungal strains t versicolor i lacteus f solani and p ostreatus was evaluated 3 3 removal of pharmaceuticals by fungi in municipal wastewater based on the previous results derived from the synergetic effect investigation conducted among the fungal strains the removal of the diclofenac was initially examined by using each fungal strain separately individual cultures furthermore all experiments were investigated under non sterile conditions using inlet wastewater from a municipal wastewater treatment plant as a fungal culture medium the overall removal rate of diclofenac by selected fungi grown in municipal wastewater for 14 incubation days is shown in the fig 4 a after 10 days of incubation the results demonstrated less than 30 removal of diclofenac for all tested fungal strains as compared to the previous results from the synthetic wastewater e g fig 2b the total removal of diclofenac by t versicolor was achieved after 10 days of incubation the removal efficiency has been decreased more than three times i e from 99 9 to 30 respectively this can be regarded a certain interaction of the tested fungal strain with other microbial community from the non sterile wastewater sample in systems of mixed populations such as bacteria and protozoa the interaction that often occurs is a competition for specific compounds 18 due to the competition among microorganisms it is possible to decrease the biological removal of substances e g pharmaceutical compounds 37 moreover the preliminary study on the growth of fungal strains in sterile inlet wastewater showed very limited poor growth data not shown this could be due to a low concentration and composition of specific compounds in inlet wastewater furthermore in the present study the initial concentration of a fungal inoculum was relatively low therefore the fungi might have been outcompeted by bacteria archaea and other fungal species from wastewater 38 thus the initial fungal concentration of biomass was increased in the further experiment 3 4 effect of diclofenac removal by fungal biofilm on k1 carriers in order to achieve a higher initial concentration of selected fungal strains the k1 carriers for biofilm formation were used as shown in fig 4b all fungal cultures were able to completely remove 99 9 diclofenac after 3 days of incubation this observation is in line with recent studies 20 39 that have also suggested to use the biofilm carriers for fungal mycelium immobilization in order to increase the laccase production and biomass growth for instance spina et al 39 showed that b adusta produced a higher enzyme activity if fungal biomass was immobilized on the carrier however a longer incubation time demonstrated a release of the diclofenac from all fungal strains back to wastewater except for t versicolor the obtained results might be explained by the use of different removal mechanisms of tested fungi for instance vasiliadou et al 18 have shown that fungi might use biosorption and or secretion of enzymes to remove pharmaceutical substances furthermore lucas et al 1 have demonstrated that sorption of the active fungal biomass might not be the same as the sorption of inactive dead biomass due to the structural changes of fungal biomass in this study the laccase enzyme activity measurements showed that t versicolor has a two times higher laccase activity on day 3 compared to other fungal strains when grown in an inlet of non sterile municipal wastewater supplementary table s2 thus it might be possible that t versicolor could use an enzyme process to degrade diclofenac since it has been removed completely therefore an additional investigation of diclofenac removal by t versicolor was done for 3 days of incubation time the result of diclofenac removal by t versicolor has been presented in fig 5 a the result showed that diclofenac has been completely 99 9 removed after 3 h of incubation while inlet wastewater without fungal inoculum of t versicolor could remove 99 9 of diclofenac after 60 h of incubation furthermore the measurement of the laccase activity showed a constant and immediate increase after incubation of t versicolor which lasted up to 15 hs no enzyme activity was observed from inlet wastewater fig 5b the difference in longer removal times compared to t versicolor might be explained due some additional time requirements for microorganim s adoption for instance formatting granules and decreasing the ph level as a strategy for diclofenac bioabsorption however more investigations should be conducted to better understand wastewater biodiversity of microorganisms and the potential of pharmaceutical biosorption with biomass additionally the results of t versicolor also indicated more than a 80 removal rate immediately after adding diclofenac therefore the role of biosorption and production of the laccase enzyme was investigated in the further study in order to better understand the removal mechanisms by t versicolor 3 5 removal efficiency and its mechanisms of t versicolor the results of the biosorption experiment showed that live cells of t versicolor could remove 99 9 of diclofenac once incubation commences at the same time the results indicated that dead fungal cells of t versicolor could not completely remove diclofenac respectively not more than 95 within a 24 hs long incubation period fig 6 a furthermore the measurement of laccase showed a constant concentration of the enzyme activity throughout the entire incubation time for live t versicolor cells while no enzyme activity was observed in the case of dead t versicolor cells fig 6b therefore results of the biosorption experiment indicated that t versicolor uses both mechanisms enzyme activity and biosorption to remove diclofenac moreover the observation of this biosorption experiment showed that laccase was responsible for removing 20 of diclofenac while the t versicolor biomass could remove 80 of diclofenac fig 6a previous studies of batch experiments have reported similar results for t versicolor for instance stenholm et al 40 have indicated a 99 9 diclofenac removal rate after a 4 h incubation period under non sterile conditions however enzymatic reactions contributed to an approximate drop of 0 5 4 conclusions this study has showed the potential of five fungal strains to remove ketoprofen and diclofenac individually and in mixed cultures experiments with synthetic wastewater media showed

14129,the removal efficiency of diclofenac and ketoprofen for five fungal strains was examined the synergistic effect between selected fungal strains using synthetic wastewater media was studied using both individual and mixed strains the mixed cultures had no additional effect in reducing diclofenac and ketoprofen in contrary fungi removed pharmaceutical substances faster when growing individually the results showed that t versicolor monoculture removed diclofenac completely 99 9 in non sterile municipal wastewater within three hours of incubation and continued to show complete reduction within 14 days using fungal biofilm carriers the mechanism of removal was proposed based on the laccase enzyme production and biosorption study which revealed that t versicolor could used in both processes additionally this study demonstrated that t versicolor could be stable in the biofilm carriers and thus able to compete with other microorganisms in wastewater to be a promising candidate to remove diclofenac from municipal wastewater during the treatment process keywords fungal treatment wastewater diclofenac ketoprofen carriers 1 introduction over the last few decades the widespread occurrence of hazardous substances such as pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides and endocrine disrupting chemicals in the aquatic environment has been recognized as an emerging environmental issue as it can cause undesirable effects on the ecosystem and human health 1 2 the main source of these compounds is effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants the conventional treatment plant is commonly designed to remove high concentrations mostly biodegradable organic matter and nutrients using mainly bacteria 3 4 thus most of the hazardous substances are not effectively removed 5 6 consequently may have negative effects on human health and aquatic ecosystem 7 for instance extensive use of antibiotics and antimicrobial agents can result in development of antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria 2 furthermore a previous study has demonstrated that diclofenac has negative effect on marine organisms such as mussels 8 although advanced treatment technologies such as ozonation advanced oxidation membrane processes and adsorption by activated carbon are considered as a promising alternative to remove hazardous substances from wastewater 9 high operating costs and formation of by products are still limiting factors to implement the advanced treatment technologies as alternative to an effective wastewater treatment process 10 therefore fungi have been considered as a promising alternative to advanced treatment methods to remove hazardous substances from wastewater 11 fungi can use hazardous substances as a secondary substrate due to their ability to produce nonspecific enzymes e g ligninolytic extracellular oxidative enzymes which are able to degrade a wide range of hazardous substances even at very low concentrations 1 5 12 13 previous studies have shown that it is attainable to achieve high removal efficiency applying biodegradation of many hazardous compounds for instance fusarium solani was able to degrade the emerging water pollutants like di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp fluoranthene and aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa in a batch scale experiment in a synthetic media for fungi 14 likewise several studies have demonstrated high removal efficiency of hazardous compounds as progesterone atenolol ibuprofen diclofenac and ketoprofen by trametes versicolor pleurotus ostreatus trichoderma reesei and irpex lacteus 15 18 in laboratory scale experiments under sterile conditions based on these investigations it has been proposed that these fungi might be suitable candidates to remove hazardous substances however most of experiments with fungal cultures both in batch and continuous reactors for hazardous substances removal have been tested by individual strains and cultured in specific nutrient media or synthetic wastewater 19 therefore there are still many unanswered questions regarding a full scale application of fungi in the wastewater treatment process one of the questions is how the use of fungal culture could affect the removal efficiency of hazardous substances and how it would compete with other microorganisms under non sterile conditions moreover the operating conditions might play a key role especially on enzyme activity for instance previous studies have demonstrated that the use of biofilm carriers not only improve fungal growth and production of enzyme activity but also increase the removal efficiency of hazardous substances 20 22 thus further research is needed to determine if the approach using fungi can be applied for the wastewater treatment process in order to better understand their ability to grow produce enzymes and remove hazardous substances in municipal wastewater under non sterile conditions the main objective of this study was to investigate the potential of five worldwide distributed fungal strains t versicolor i lacteus p ostreatus t reesei and f solani to remove hazardous substances from municipal wastewater under non sterile conditions in this work the ph level the effect of carriers the removal efficiency and the enzymatic laccase activity were examined for each strain separately and in mixed cultures in batch scale experiments for a certain period of time to the best of our knowledge this is the first study where the synergetic effects have been tested furthermore the effect of non sterile municipal wastewater using fungal biofilm carriers k1 with the most promising strains was tested to assess the potential of fungal treatment to remove hazardous substances additionally the difference of initial inoculum for fungal cultures was analyzed in order to determine the removal efficiency in non sterile wastewater finally the biosorption experiment was done to better understand fungal removal mechanisms for pharmaceutical substances 2 materials

a t test two tailed distribution significance level 0 05 and a data analysis ms excel 2013 was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth effect of selected fungal strains during the initial study the growth and interaction of selected fungal strains were tested by a classical cultivation method with and without pharmaceutical substances the combinations of fungi were selected based on the previous study 26 where these fungi demonstrated the most appropriate ability to grow in a sterile wastewater agar media in this study diclofenac and ketoprofen were selected as model compounds due to high levels of consumption in various european countries and their appearance in the wastewater treatment plant effluents 27 furthermore these compounds contain different functional groups that might provide a new insight into the removal efficiency by fungi the results indicated that all fungal strains could grow in the presence of pharmaceuticals similar to control strains without pharmaceutical substances supplementary fig s1 when the cultures grown together the formation of the inhibition zone among the tested strains was observed fig 1 for instance results of the interaction test demonstrated an inhibition zone formation among of t reesei i lacteus and t versicolor fig 1a the same was observed in the case of f solani and p ostreatus strains fig 1b hence it would be an interest of the research to find out whether these fungal strains could remove pharmaceutical substances by applying mixed cultures or culturing them individually in liquid media of synthetic wastewater the fungal strains of t reesei t versicolor i lacteus f solani and p ostreatus were investigated in the individual experiment to test their capability to remove ketoprofen and diclofenac in a synthetic wastewater medium although previous studies have shown that the maximum concentrations of diclofenac and ketoprofen in municipal wastewater vary from 0 44 to7 1 μg l 1 for diclofenac and 0 004 to 8 56 μg l 1 for ketoprofen 10 28 relatively higher concentrations e g mg l 1 of these substances can be found in the industrial wastewater and can be acknowledged as a potential ecological risk 29 therefore the concentration of 5 mg l 1 was selected and investigated for both substances the results showed that only t versicolor was able to reduce more than 80 of ketoprofen after 21 days of incubation while other fungal strains did not indicate any reduction of ketoprofen after 7 days of incubation fig 2 a furthermore results from the individual experiment of t reseei i lacteus f solani and p ostreatus showed an increase of ketoprofen concentration fig 2a for instance the hplc peak profile of the t reseei has shown a double peak formation close to the control peak after 21 days of incubation which presumably has caused misleading calculated results of the analyzed substance s removal supplementary fig 2a these results may indicate the formation of by products from the degraded chemical compounds as described earlier 14 30 therefore the analytical method to analyze by products with the hplc system needs to be improved in additional studies in contrast to ketoprofen fungal strains of t versicolor i lacteus and p ostreatus showed a higher removal efficiency of diclofenac for instance the results derived from the individual experiment of t versicolor i lacteus and p ostreatus have shown the ability to remove more than 80 of diclofenac while f solani and t reseei were able to remove only 40 of diclofenac within 7 days of incubation fig 2b however a longer incubation period of f solani indicated a maximum reduction of 90 of diclofenac on day 21 while t reseei demonstrated significantly the same concentration as of the beginning of this experiment as the hplc peak profile of t reseei did not demonstrate any extra peak formation supplementary fig 2b it has been observed that this strain started to release this compound back to synthetic wastewater after 3 days of incubation it might be explain by the sorption as the strategy for pharmaceutical substance removal 31 overall the obtained results of the individual cultures showed that selected strains especially t versicolor i lacteus p ostreatus and f solani are promising candidates for ketoprofen and diclofenac removal therefore the synergetic effect of fungi was investigated in the further study 3 2 synergistic effect of selected fungal strains the synergetic effect of mixed cultures from t reesei in combination with i lacteus and t versicolor was investigated when t reesei in the mix with i lacteus and t versicolor was cultivated for 3 days the reduction of ketoprofen and diclofenac was observed fig 3 for example t reesei in the mix with i lacteus demonstrated up to 60 reduction of both pharmaceutical substances after 3 days of incubation however results of the hplc analysis for a longer incubation period of t reesei in the mix with i lacteus and t versicolor did not show any chemical compound reduction furthermore results of the hplc peak profile from a mixed experiment of t reesei combined with i lacteus and t versicolor after 7 days of incubation demonstrated an extra hplc peak formation causing an increase in the concentration of ketoprofen supplementary fig s3 it might be explained by fungal cell surface sorption as hazardous substances occur due to physicochemical interaction between the substance and the functional groups which are present on the fungal cell surface this type of biosorption is relatively rapid and can be reversible 32 the fig 3 presents the ketoprofen and diclofenac removal results using i lacteus in the combination with t versicolor i lacteus in a combination with t versicolor were able to reduce ketoprofen for more than 50 after 3 days of incubation until the end of the incubation period of 14 days fig 3a furthermore after 14 days of incubation based on the individual combination of i lacteus the results have shown a 25 removal rate of ketoprofen while t versicolor could remove up to 40 of the substance thus the removal efficiency in a mixed culture with t versicolor and i lacteus was relatively higher compared to individual cultures figs 2a and 3 a on the contrary the combination of i lacteus and t versicolor was able to completely 99 9 remove diclofenac concentration after 7 days of incubation fig 3b results showed that there was no statistically significant difference p 0 05 between removal efficiency if the fungi were grown separately or when compared to the mixed cultures figs 2b and 3 b for instance after 7 days of individual incubation of i lacteus and t versicolor they demonstrated more than 90 removal of diclofenac furthermore in all three combinations the analysis of the hplc did not display any extra peak formation comparing to the control hplc peak of diclofenac therefore results from mixed cultures had no extra effect in reducing diclofenac in the sample furthermore the results of the mixed experiment of t reesei in a combination with i lacteus and t versicolor demonstrated a negative synergetic effect in removing diclofenac and ketoprofen using t reesei on i lacteus and t versicolor for instance the combination of i lacteus and t versicolor completely removed 99 9 diclofenac while t reesei in the combination with t versicolor and or i lacteus was not able to remove more than 20 of diclofenac after 14 days of incubation fig 3b the synergistic relationship effect of removing ketoprofen and diclofenac between f solani and p ostreatus was also investigated see fig 3a and b these strains were mixed together based on the previous study 26 where both tested cultures separately demonstrated a slower growth rate in a sterile wastewater agar media comparing to t reesei i lacteus and t versicolor the results of ketoprofen reduction results using mixed cultures of f solani and p ostreatus demonstrated a similar tendency as previously derived results i e there was a difficulty with the ketoprofen analysis utilizing the hplc technique for instance all samples demonstrated an increase of ketoprofen while the reduction was observed only for an individual bioassay of p ostreatus after 21 days of incubation see figs 2a and 3 a on the contrary the combination of f solani and p ostreatus showed 90 removal of diclofenac after 14 days of incubation fig 3b furthermore the results from individual p ostreatus culture demonstrated a faster removal efficiency of diclofenac this compound was 99 9 removed after 14 days of incubation comparing with the mixed cultures where 80 of diclofenac was removed after 14 days of incubation figs 2b and 3 b overall the results of the synergistic study demonstrated the ability to remove pharmaceutical substances with fungal strains in most cases the results showed that fungi can remove pharmaceutical substances faster if they grow individually the possible reason to reduce pharmaceutical substances in mixed cultures may be due to the competition and growth inhibition between the fungal strains as observed in this study fig 1 fig 1 shows that the growth of mixed fungal cultures can visibly observed on an agar plate emphasizing the inhibition of growth though t reesei out compete the growth against i lacteus and t vesicolor the reduction of pharmaceutical substances was lower compared to the i lacteus and t versicolor mixed culture there was an inhibition zone observed around i lacteus and t vesicolor mixed cultures of f solani and p ostreatus showed a difference at the meeting zone of these two cultures this might cause an effect in reducing pharmaceutical substances therefore further experiments were focused on individual species rather than mixed the removal of pharmaceutical substances by fungal strains varies widely from one compound to another yang et al 6 have stated that physicochemical properties of the target molecules appear to be a key reason for such variation for instance some hazardous substances are easily biosorbed due to their high hydrophobicity some have molecular features that render them readily biodegradable by fungi while others are resistant to the fungi enzyme system due to certain features of their molecular structure 6 for instance ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug which belongs to the substituted 2 phenyl propionic acids group 24 its structural formula demonstrates functional groups of methyl keton and carboxylic acid group table 1 the presence of electron withdrawing functional groups such as amide conr2 halogen x nitro no2 and carboxylic cooh group generates an electron deficiency and thus renders the compounds less susceptible to oxidative catabolism 6 therefore the appearance of the carboxylic acid group in the ketoprofen structure might explain the difficulties to remove this compound for investigated fungal strains for instance previous studies have shown that ketoprofen is not completely removed in most cases of wastewater treatment 33 additionally palli et al 16 have demonstrated that heat killed biomass of t versicolor can remove only 15 of ketoprofen moreover marco urrea et al 15 proved that the enzyme system of t versicolor is not involved in ketoprofen degradation therefore the removal of ketoprofen required further investigation in contrast to ketoprofen which has functional groups of methyl keton and carboxylic acid groups diclofenac is an anti inflammatory drug with one functional group hydroxyl the hydroxyl group has been reported as the first electron donating group for diclofenac 6 therefore diclofenac can be efficiently degraded by a fungal treatment furthermore several studies have presented similar results of diclofenac removal by t versicol and i lacteus 1 6 for instance lucas et al 1 have demonstrated high removal efficiency of diclofenac by t versicolor and i lacteus in batch experiments indicating the contribution of the sorption processes however most of these studies have been conducted on an autoclaved soil or on a synthetic media 1 34 in this study the laccase enzyme activity was measured to better understand the relationship between the enzyme activity and the reduction of diclofenac the activity of the laccase enzyme was observed only when fungi were incubated separately supplementary table s1 therefore the results of the interaction tests and laccase activity confirm the assumption that the fungal strains are able to remove diclofenac with a higher degree of efficiency if they are incubated separately and are not mixed this might be explained by fungal interaction with each other on enzyme production however further investigation has to be carried out the obtained results are similar and comparable with the results from the previous study conducted by vasiliadou et al 18 the study examined the efficiency of two white rot fungi t versicolor and g lucidum vasiliadou et al 18 demonstrated the simultaneous use of both strains indicating a significant decrease in removal efficiencies of tested hazardous substances e g carbamazepine and sulpiride therefore the individual growth strategy to remove pharmaceutical compounds does not only exclude competition and inhibition among the strains but also increases the efficiency of pharmaceutical substances removal mechanisms e g extracellular enzyme production for compound degradation furthermore the effect of the ph level might also play an important role in terms of the fungal metabolisms activity to produce enzymes and affect the morphology of the fungal cell structure 35 therefore the ph was monitored during the incubation time however measuring the ph level in all samples no changes were observed during the incubation time data not shown the results from this study have demonstrated the potential to remove diclofenac efficiently and successfully under sterile conditions by selected fungi however results could not be as significant as they would be if fungi would be grown under real wastewater conditions with the variable microbial community in municipal wastewater 36 for this reason in the further work the capability to remove diclofenac in non sterile municipal wastewater by the selected fungal strains t versicolor i lacteus f solani and p ostreatus was evaluated 3 3 removal of pharmaceuticals by fungi in municipal wastewater based on the previous results derived from the synergetic effect investigation conducted among the fungal strains the removal of the diclofenac was initially examined by using each fungal strain separately individual cultures furthermore all experiments were investigated under non sterile conditions using inlet wastewater from a municipal wastewater treatment plant as a fungal culture medium the overall removal rate of diclofenac by selected fungi grown in municipal wastewater for 14 incubation days is shown in the fig 4 a after 10 days of incubation the results demonstrated less than 30 removal of diclofenac for all tested fungal strains as compared to the previous results from the synthetic wastewater e g fig 2b the total removal of diclofenac by t versicolor was achieved after 10 days of incubation the removal efficiency has been decreased more than three times i e from 99 9 to 30 respectively this can be regarded a certain interaction of the tested fungal strain with other microbial community from the non sterile wastewater sample in systems of mixed populations such as bacteria and protozoa the interaction that often occurs is a competition for specific compounds 18 due to the competition among microorganisms it is possible to decrease the biological removal of substances e g pharmaceutical compounds 37 moreover the preliminary study on the growth of fungal strains in sterile inlet wastewater showed very limited poor growth data not shown this could be due to a low concentration and composition of specific compounds in inlet wastewater furthermore in the present study the initial concentration of a fungal inoculum was relatively low therefore the fungi might have been outcompeted by bacteria archaea and other fungal species from wastewater 38 thus the initial fungal concentration of biomass was increased in the further experiment 3 4 effect of diclofenac removal by fungal biofilm on k1 carriers in order to achieve a higher initial concentration of selected fungal strains the k1 carriers for biofilm formation were used as shown in fig 4b all fungal cultures were able to completely remove 99 9 diclofenac after 3 days of incubation this observation is in line with recent studies 20 39 that have also suggested to use the biofilm carriers for fungal mycelium immobilization in order to increase the laccase production and biomass growth for instance spina et al 39 showed that b adusta produced a higher enzyme activity if fungal biomass was immobilized on the carrier however a longer incubation time demonstrated a release of the diclofenac from all fungal strains back to wastewater except for t versicolor the obtained results might be explained by the use of different removal mechanisms of tested fungi for instance vasiliadou et al 18 have shown that fungi might use biosorption and or secretion of enzymes to remove pharmaceutical substances furthermore lucas et al 1 have demonstrated that sorption of the active fungal biomass might not be the same as the sorption of inactive dead biomass due to the structural changes of fungal biomass in this study the laccase enzyme activity measurements showed that t versicolor has a two times higher laccase activity on day 3 compared to other fungal strains when grown in an inlet of non sterile municipal wastewater supplementary table s2 thus it might be possible that t versicolor could use an enzyme process to degrade diclofenac since it has been removed completely therefore an additional investigation of diclofenac removal by t versicolor was done for 3 days of incubation time the result of diclofenac removal by t versicolor has been presented in fig 5 a the result showed that diclofenac has been completely 99 9 removed after 3 h of incubation while inlet wastewater without fungal inoculum of t versicolor could remove 99 9 of diclofenac after 60 h of incubation furthermore the measurement of the laccase activity showed a constant and immediate increase after incubation of t versicolor which lasted up to 15 hs no enzyme activity was observed from inlet wastewater fig 5b the difference in longer removal times compared to t versicolor might be explained due some additional time requirements for microorganim s adoption for instance formatting granules and decreasing the ph level as a strategy for diclofenac bioabsorption however more investigations should be conducted to better understand wastewater biodiversity of microorganisms and the potential of pharmaceutical biosorption with biomass additionally the results of t versicolor also indicated more than a 80 removal rate immediately after adding diclofenac therefore the role of biosorption and production of the laccase enzyme was investigated in the further study in order to better understand the removal mechanisms by t versicolor 3 5 removal efficiency and its mechanisms of t versicolor the results of the biosorption experiment showed that live cells of t versicolor could remove 99 9 of diclofenac once incubation commences at the same time the results indicated that dead fungal cells of t versicolor could not completely remove diclofenac respectively not more than 95 within a 24 hs long incubation period fig 6 a furthermore the measurement of laccase showed a constant concentration of the enzyme activity throughout the entire incubation time for live t versicolor cells while no enzyme activity was observed in the case of dead t versicolor cells fig 6b therefore results of the biosorption experiment indicated that t versicolor uses both mechanisms enzyme activity and biosorption to remove diclofenac moreover the observation of this biosorption experiment showed that laccase was responsible for removing 20 of diclofenac while the t versicolor biomass could remove 80 of diclofenac fig 6a previous studies of batch experiments have reported similar results for t versicolor for instance stenholm et al 40 have indicated a 99 9 diclofenac removal rate after a 4 h incubation period under non sterile conditions however enzymatic reactions contributed to an approximate drop of 0 5 4 conclusions this study has showed the potential of five fungal strains to remove ketoprofen and diclofenac individually and in mixed cultures experiments with synthetic wastewater media showed that fungi compete with each other since higher removal efficiency was observed if the fungi was grown individually the capability of selected fungal strains to remove diclofenac in a non sterile municipal wastewater sample using carriers showed a promising approach for the wastewater treatment process the results show that t versicolor could fully 99 9 remove diclofenac after a 3 hs long incubation period in non sterile municipal wastewater moreover t versicolor demonstrated an ability to use both mechanisms enzyme activity and biosorption to remove diclofenac therefore t versicolor could be a promising candidate to remove pharmaceutical substances by wastewater treatment process declaration of competing interest we have no conflicts of interest to disclose acknowledgments the
