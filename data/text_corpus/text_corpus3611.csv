18055,the aim of this research is to clarify the contribution of sunlight wavelengths irradiance and fe2 h2o2 during bacterial disinfection by the photo fenton process in clear surface waters we considered different solar spectrum distributions visible uva visible sub critical irradiances 0 400 w m2 focusing on the action modes of e coli inactivation by the constituents involved in the composite process at low μm reactants concentration fe2 h2o2 in in ultrapure mq water we report that solar disinfection improved with fenton reagents photo fenton process is a reality from very low light irradiance values 200 w m2 and made possible even without the presence of uva radiation even when using low quantities of the fenton reagents 0 5 mg l fe2 5 mg l h2o2 under light exposure h2o2 was found to augment the intracellular fenton process and fe2 to initiate further distinct oxidative actions finally validation was performed in lake geneva water over a wider irradiance range where the photo fenton process was found to be reagent dependent in low irradiance shifting to light driven in the higher values graphical abstract image 1 keywords photo fenton solar disinfection e coli light intensity kinetics water treatment 1 introduction the evolution of the fenton process since its conception in 1894 has witnessed tremendous leaps from its use as a decontamination process at acidic ph to a possible water purification process aided by the sun via the discovery that it can still work at near neutral ph values giannakis 2019 there is a rapidly growing literature on neutral ph fenton treatment which indicates that scientific community are focusing their interest to decrease the costs and drawbacks acidifying and neutralization of effluent of the fenton reaction conte et al 2016 de luca et al 2014 ortega gómez et al 2015 over the last years works on disinfection processes by modifications of the fenton reaction are performed considering the iron source homogeneous or heterogeneous garcía fernández et al 2012 rodríguez chueca et al 2016 ruales lonfat et al 2014 different type of light aguilar et al 2017 garcía fernández et al 2019 and inducing the advanced oxidation process by radiofrequencies and electrochemistry rodríguez chueca et al 2014 valero et al 2017b in addition some studies have been conducted on mild photo fenton process with low concentrations of reagents for water disinfection a research field that has gained considerable attention and was recently reviewed giannakis 2018 this process has been found efficient against a series of microorganisms such as bacteria viruses and other microorganisms present in different effluents the use of solar light as radiation source to induce the photo enhanced version of fenton is promising since the photo fenton reaction can be effectuated with low energy photons e g without artificial light sources in the near uv part of the spectrum thus photo fenton has potential as a low cost aop that can be realized under solar irradiation torrades et al 2004 this makes it a prospect that could be successfully applied in developing or sunny countries in the same context that the solar disinfection process sodis is performed mcguigan et al 2012 but envisioning its improvement by the fenton reaction the solar photo inactivation processes for water disinfection have proven to be more efficient when a higher solar energy dose is received in the system but the relationship between microorganism photo inactivation rate and solar exposure time wavelength exposure energy received or dose applied ortega gómez et al 2016 is actually far from straightforward in fact even the baseline process solar light is not always subject to the reciprocity law similar doses deriving from high irradiance short times are more effective than the ones deriving from the respective low irradiance long exposure times and temperature during treatment further complicates the issue giannakis et al 2015 furthermore the majority of the researches carried out with artificial solar radiation use solar irradiances from 400 to 500 w m2 castro alférez et al 2017a giannakis et al 2018 porras et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2015a 2015b and above following the recommendation of the sodis foundation but in a real application sometimes the climate conditions or the hourly interval in which the treatment is applied hinder reaching this irradiance value in addition besides the irradiance the wavelength of emission is highly affecting the bacterial inactivation pathways various studies have documented wavelength effects of e coli indicating that endogenous damage decreases steeply as wavelength increases in the solar range with wavelengths above 400 nm having minimal effect in the absence of external sensitizers nelson et al 2018 however hessling et al documented the photo inactivation of bacteria by endogenous photosensitizers by exposure to visible light of different wavelengths hessling et al 2017 the accumulation of findings on the action modes of solar light suggests that the action of light is not limited in uv induced mutations of the microorganisms genome but it rather initiates a series of oxidative events an intracellular photo fenton that leads to microorganism inactivation fisher and nelson 2014 giannakis et al 2018 previous works have suggested that the photo fenton process is actually the enhancement of the solar inflicted bacterial inactivation pathways by the addition of h2o2 and iron this results in the enhancement the external production of hydroxyl radicals in the bulk and a push in the internal reactive oxygen species ros imbalance bosshard et al 2010 the action mode of solar light against bacteria reveals the necessity of accumulation of endogenous damage before their inactivation giannakis et al 2016a mediated primarily by h2o2 accumulation castro alférez et al 2016 and its reaction with intracellular fe however more than a decade later from the first studies related to disinfection by fenton process at near neutral ph the process has been far from elucidated giannakis et al 2018 some mechanistic models of e coli inactivation have been recently developed namely by solar light and by the action of solar uv radiation and simultaneous solar mild heat occurring during sodis castro alférez et al 2017a 2017b the enhancement by fe and h2o2 then would add to the existing pathways as previously described the consideration of fenton reagents as participants during solar disinfection can also modify the wavelengths from which the photo assisted process inactivates bacteria iron absorbs light in longer wavelengths than the respective effective ones inside the cell giannakis et al 2016b however there is a lack of information about the effect of fenton reagents explaining e coli inactivation as a function of the irradiance and the emitted light spectra taking in consideration the above parameters namely the uncertainty of the irradiance due to the reciprocity law the different and complex phenomena taking place by uv and or visible light and the interplay of the aforementioned factors with fe h2o2 it is obvious that the photo fenton process is far from elucidated the aim of this research is to clarify the effect of sunlight spectra irradiance and fenton reagents addition separately or as a sum of events on the disinfection pathways that lead to e coli inactivation we employ a step wise constructed investigation of the different systems involved in the photo fenton process in order to treat the issues of i visible or uva vis light mediated disinfection ii the threshold where fenton reagents become germicidal and iii the point where this process is no longer considered fenton but photo fenton to achieve these goals we study the fenton process dark light alone visible or uva vis light light h2o2 light fe and light h2o2 fe photo fenton processes the inactivation of e coli is approached in a detailed kinetic investigation in order to assess the importance of each aforementioned component while we further attempt a mechanistic interpretation of the bacterial inactivation to contextualize our findings finally the tipping point where the fenton process is effectively converted to photo fenton is estimated and validation of the suggested mechanisms was effectuated in solar disinfection of the clear natural waters of lake geneva 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals reagents and water matrices ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o sigma aldrich hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 w w sigma aldrich hydroxylamine hydrochloride nh2 oh hcl ferrozine sigma aldrich and titanium iv oxysulfate iv fluka were purchased from sigma aldrich switzerland all chemicals were reagent grade glassware and reactors containing iron were acid soaked after every use to avoid cross contamination 10 hno3 2 days all samples and solutions were prepared with milli q water 18 2 m ω cm the physicochemical analysis of the lake geneva water used in the validation tests is provided in the supplementary material table s1 the water was used after a filtration from a 2 mm whatmann paper in order to remove large sand particles without removing the dissolved natural organic matter fractions no autoclaving or sterilization took place 2 2 bacterial strain the wild type escherichia coli k12 dsm no 498 was used for all the experiments the detailed preparation of the bacterial inoculum was described elsewhere giannakis et al 2013 the resulting e coli suspension has a concentration of 109 colony forming units per ml cfu ml and the sample was prepared by diluting 1000 times the bacterial stock in milli q water i e 100 μl e coli suspension in 100 ml milli q water leading to an initial concentration of approximately 106 cfu ml 2 3 inactivation experiments the assays were performed in laboratory scale using a solar simulator suntest cps heraeus equipped with xenon lamp and uvc filter global irradiance levels of 50 100 200 and 400 w m2 were evaluated with and without uva doses 2 2 5 of photons the solar simulator is equipped with a filter of uvc light 290 nm see supplementary fig s1 afterwards in order to prevent evaporation a glass cover has been placed on the reactor for the cut off see supplementary fig s2 effectively solar spectrum wavelengths above 310 nm were used in all experiments hereon uva with visible light uva vis except in those without uva radiation in which an uv filter of polymethylmethacrylate pmma was used to filter out wavelengths below 376 nm fig s3 hereon visible vis light this modification was done in order to simulate the real sodis conditions typically water is contained in plastic bottles which filter out all uvb in absence of said cover the direct germicidal uvb mechanisms and the photo lytic actions on h2o2 would need to be considered all irradiance values were measured and fixed after the addition of the possible filters global and uv irradiance was monitored during experiments by a uv radiometer cuv3 and a pyranometer cm6b from kipp zonen connected to a combilog 1020 data logger theodor friedrichs co double wall glass vessels of 150 ml with external diameter of 7 3 cm and height of 9 2 cm equipped with lateral opaque jacket to allow water recirculation were employed as reactors these reactors were containing 100 ml of milli q water spiked with e coli in a level of 106 cfu ml and were connected to a cryomat recirculation system which recirculated water within the double walls and without contact with the experimental matrix and kept the temperature inside the samples at 20 2 c in order to avoid any thermal inactivation h2o2 and or fe2 were added to the solutions at different concentration levels h2o2 0 1 5 and 10 mg l and fe2 0 0 1 0 5 and 1 mg l in the case of h2o2 or iron only light assisted systems the concentration added to the solutions were only the highest ones 1 mg l fe 10 mg l h2o2 the reactors properly distributed in the solar simulator were continuously stirred at 350 rpm and the bacterial concentration was measured before exposure and at timely intervals 15 30 60 90 120 180 240 300 and 360 min of treatment all experiments were performed at least in duplicate usually three independent tests biological replicates in two separate plating series statistical replicates in minimum two consecutive dilutions technical replicates five systems were tested for their inactivation effect on e coli i dark ii light iii light h2o2 hv h2o2 iv light iron hv fe2 and v fenton reagents hv h2o2 fe2 the photo experiments were conducted both in presence of uva vis light and without the uva component vis light illumination ph h2o2 and dissolved iron were concurrently monitored in an additional reactor placed in the solar simulator the starting ph of the experiments was 6 5 0 1 and was never below 5 8 0 2 values noted only for photo fenton with 1 10 fe2 h2o2 values a detailed presentation of the ph will not be given as the ph is considered to remain in the near neutral domain and the no shift in the catalytic mechanisms is expected barona et al 2015 2 4 post irradiation events for the post irradiation monitoring of survival or regrowth of e coli aliquots were drawn at distinct pre defined intervals and stored in the dark at 22 c bacterial population of the last acquired sample was determined at 24 and 48 h after the photo inactivation experiments residual h2o2 was neutralized by the addition of catalase from bovine liver merck switzerland 2 5 microbiological methods e coli cultivability was monitored during assays after carrying out appropriate 10 fold dilutions in a sterile saline solution and spreading of 100 μl of sample on plate count agar pca merck switzerland the planted petri dishes were incubated at 37 c during 24 h for enumeration of the colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml once the experiments were finished the water samples were kept stored in the dark and the post irradiation cellular viability after 24 and 48 h was evaluated employing the same procedure described above between uses all materials were soaked in acid and washed with distilled water before autoclaving and solutions were sterilized by autoclaving to 121 c and 15 20 psi during 15 min 2 6 analytical methods hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was determined by titanium oxysulfate method din 38 402 h15 1 ml sample was mixed with 20 μl titanium iv oxysulfate and the absorbance was measured in a spectrophotometer at 410 nm dissolved iron fe2 and fe3 was analyzed by the ferrozine method as described elsewhere spuhler et al 2010 viollier et al 2000 briefly 1 6 ml sample 0 2 ml hydroxylamine hydrochloride 10 w w 0 5 ml acetate buffer ph 4 65 and 0 2 ferrozine 4 9 mm were step wise mixed together after 20 min of reaction the final absorbance was measured at 562 nm in a spectrophotometer the solution ph was monitored with a metrohm 827 ph meter 2 7 kinetic models of microbial inactivation microbial inactivation curves can have different shapes according to the inactivation mechanism in the simplest case microbial inactivation vs time follows a linear decay although deviations such as shoulders or tails are commonly observed the phenomenon of an initial shoulder occurs when there is a lag phase in which a fraction of surviving microorganisms is maintained constant during the first instants of treatment followed by a linear decline the tailing off effect consists of an initial linear inactivation phase followed by a slow decrease in microbial populations when both phenomena occur the inactivation curve has sigmoidal shape in this research the use of kinetic models serves to check the viability of using these models to compare the behavior of e coli in function of the different parameters analyzed several authors have previously used the selected kinetic models to describe the inactivation of microbes in water by different treatments barbeau et al 1999 rodríguez chueca et al 2015a 2015b rodríguez chueca et al 2016 yoon jin lee et al 2002 younas et al 2014 the linear model and their modifications are applied to adjust the experimental data the linear model or chick watson model is a modification of chick model watson believed that it was possible to incorporate in the model the effect of the concentration of the disinfectant on the reaction rate pernitsky et al 1995 the linear model is given by eq 1 where k is the kinetic constant eq 1 ln n t n 0 kt in order to explain the deviations of the linear model it was modified so as to introduce shoulder and tail phenomenon geeraerd et al 2000 eq 2 describes the linear model with shoulder and with tail eq 2 n t n 0 n res e k max t e k max sl 1 e k max sl 1 e k max t n res in order to obtain the kinetic coefficients of each model described above it was necessary to adjust the experimental values to the corresponding equations by non linear regression techniques the parameters of the models were adjusted to equations using interactive algorithms based on the least squares method rodríguez chueca et al 2016 valero et al 2015 the solver and ginafit tools geeraerd and van impe inactivation model fitting tool geeraerd et al 2005 of the microsoft excel program were used in this study two fitting parameters were used to assess the quality of the fitting the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse only the fits with a value of at least r2 0 90 and with low standard error were considered in this research 3 results and discussion in order to dissociate the constituents of the composite photo fenton process the results will be presented following a stepwise construction dark processes light light h2o2 or fe light h2o2 fe photo fenton thus the processes will not be repeated in the subsequent steps 3 1 dark control experiments fig 1 represents the evolution of e coli concentration log cfu ml in absence of light the dark experiment without reagents did not exert any reduction on the bacteria population milli q water has no effect in bacterial viability in the 6 h experimental duration so any effects might be due to the die off of sensitive cells mainly attributed to the osmotic shock suffered when introduced in mq water furthermore although e coli endogenously generate h2o2 its scavenging is effective in proficient cells and does not affect its viability unless this balance is disturbed korshunov and imlay 2010 kumar and imlay 2013 seaver and imlay 2004 2001a the same results were obtained with the addition of h2o2 in the bulk hydrogen peroxide has a similar polarity to water which allows its diffusion into the bacteria and potentially damage the cell by oxidative strees via internal fenton reaction but the presence of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase ahp in growing cells and catalases kat in the cytosol of stationary phase e coli cells seaver and imlay 2001b results to its fast decomposition in stationary phase cells as in our tests mainly kate acts as an efficient protection against overload of this long living ros nelson et al 2018 however previous works showed that the intracellular h2o2 concentration is 20 compared to the external addition in scavenging proficient cells seaver and imlay 2001a two main categories of h2o2 concentrations can be suggested related with different pathways of damage giannakis et al 2016a low and high 1 3 mm concentration in this study a h2o2 concentration of 0 29 mm is added to the sample hence mainly intracellular h2o2 damage would be attained not membrane oxidation so the h2o2 presence in the bulk is not expected to induce cell damage uhl and dukan 2016 hence this mode action is evidently negibigble under the studied operational conditions concerning fe2 addition e coli inactivation was close to 1 logu 90 loss of cell viability in 6 h theoretically the addition of fe2 can have a bactericidal effect by itself since the ferrous ions can diffuse into the cells and promote an intracellular fenton process by the adventitious generation of h2o2 in the cell and the un sequestered fe spuhler et al 2010 at neutral ph the iron species present in solution is fe oh 0 2 aq this can form complexes with the negatively charged e coli cell despite its uneven distribution of positively and negatively charged groups on its cell wall e coli are known to have both charges but overall negative and it is logical to assume their complexation with iron gumy et al 2006 pignatello et al 2006 as such we have to consider the possibility that a part of the apparent reduction of cultivability might be attributed to the formation of fe bacteria coagulants which affect the estimation of the colony forming units after the natural process of iron oxidation by dissolved o2 from fe2 to fe3 the action mode on e coli inactivation changes mainly due to the precipitation of fe3 however even the dissolved iron is eventually transformed to iron oxide as a consequence of the near neutral ph conditions in absence of light nevertheless this might not stop the effect of fe as there were important observations related to iron oxides interaction with bacteria châtellier et al 2004 pouran et al 2014 promoting internal fenton as well finally the simultaneous addition of both reagents fe h2o2 inducing the fenton process didn t produce any significant effect in 6 h of treatment theoretically fe2 drives to the homogeneous fenton in which fe2 is oxidized to fe3 eq 3 eq 3 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h h o eq 4 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h h o 2 the kinetics of eq 4 is several orders of magnitude slower than the respective ones of eq 3 and thus eq 4 is the rate limiting step pignatello et al 2006 soon the predominant iron species in bulk is fe3 according to the iron speciation diagram at neutral ph fe oh 3 and fe oh 2 will be the predominant species pignatello et al 2006 fe3 may form oxides and precipitate demarchis et al 2015 the oxidized iron could possibly lead a heterogeneous fenton reaction but in 360 min the e coli concentration didn t decrease indicating a negligible contribution compared to the homogeneous phase we have to mention here that a comparison among iron addition and the fenton reagents experiments showed that the bacterial inactivation is much higher in the system fe2 dark 90 of inactivation than in the system fe2 h2o2 dark where fe2 is rapidly oxidized to fe3 fenton reaction sphuler et al also obtained that fe2 dark produced an e coli inactivation higher than the fenton process similar conditions spuhler et al 2010 3 2 effect of different light types on the inactivation mechanisms and the wavelength dependence of e coli inactivation pathways fig 2 reflects the evolution of e coli concentration in the different experiments carried out under light in presence of visible or uva vis irradiation in fig 2a the visible induced inactivation of e coli is negligible independently of the applied irradiance value in the range of 50 400 w m2 there is no photo inactivation of e coli contrary to the data reviewed by hessling et al related to photoinactivation of bacteria by visible light hessling et al 2017 our experimental conditions are either provide a low flux or photo reactivation manifests as an antagonistic process controlled by the photolyase enzyme activated in the vis region sihna and authoranonymous 2002 normally sensitization of porphyrins could lead to 1o2 generation and subsequently to intracellular lesions that would decrease the cell viability szocs et al 1999 but apparently here there is light limitation or antagonism the simulated solar induced inactivation results uva vis fig 2b show that e coli do not suffer from oxidative stress when the irradiance is in the range of 50 100 w m2 and similar results were achieved in vis light experiments however from 100 w m2 and onwards photo inactivation of e coli is observed so the defense mechanism is no longer sufficiently protective total inactivation is achieved after 6 h of uva vis light exposure at 400 w m2 the damage is related with either photodynamic or photo sensitized reactions regardless of the presence of oxygen for the latter case muela et al 2002 the initial shoulder of the inactivation curves fig 2b might be caused by many different reasons such as the presence of clumps of bacteria bad mixing etc geeraerd et al 2000 however in these operational conditions in the irradiated uva vis systems we assume that the main reason is the capacity of bacteria to withstand certain levels of damage reparation i e cell s defense capacity giannakis et al justified that the solar induced system using 600 w m2 presents delay phase due to the low irradiance applied higher value than the irradiance range used in this research furthermore the auto reparation time is decreasing proportionally to the irradiance from 100 w m2 hence it is a light controlled process giannakis et al 2018 however once the photo oxidative stress begins to manifest linear decay the slope of the inactivation curve is very similar in the range 200 400 w m2 so once the self defense capacity is outdone there is no strong dependence on the irradiance values as far as the mechanism of inactivation is concerned berney et al observed that as uva light dose increases e coli experiences a reduction of efflux pump activity and atp synthesis loss of membrane potential glucose uptake activity and cultivability and finally permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane berney m weilenmann h u 2006 the observed photo inactivation is due to the absorption of uva photons by endogenous photosensitizers such as cytochrome flavin tryptophan and other aromatic amino acids inducing photo oxidation reactions type i and ii which involve the formation of transient species and ros pfeifer et al 2005 ravanat et al 2001 and by the effect on catalases whose scavenging activity is inhibited eisenstark 1998 moreover we propose that an intracellular fenton process happens during uva vis exposure since h2o2 produced via cellular respiration or by activation of flavoenzymes reacts with iron released from different possible intracellular sources fe s clusters siderophores etc as a result the ros generated in photo oxidation and fenton reactions including the highly reactive ho attack dna rna lipids and proteins these chain reactions result in loss of cell functions mutations and block of dna replication cabiscol e tamarit j 2000 some studies demonstrate that ros and their accumulated oxidative damages at intracellular level are key in solar water disinfection castro alférez et al 2017a 2017b as a proof for the oxidative process taking place in our experiments the results of post irradiation monitoring show that no regrowth occurred for any experimental conditions zero values data not shown summarizing although the osmotic imbalance cannot be excluded spuhler et al 2010 valero et al 2017a light induced dna mutations would have been easily repaired and regrowth would manifest hence an oxidative process including ho and 1o2 must take place 3 3 action mode of light assisted h2o2 inactivation of e coli at low irradiance values fig 3 reflects the evolution of e coli concentration in the different experiments carried out in light h2o2 systems in presence of vis radiation or uva vis the vis h2o2 systems with irradiance in the range of 50 100 w m2 do not result in cell damage or alternatively the self defense cellular mechanisms are enough to cope with the stresses generated in these operational conditions however the synergy between h2o2 and visible light is clear from irradiances north of 100 w m2 since the cells are not able to repair the damage produced by visible radiation in presence of h2o2 hessling et al confirms the absorption of visible light by porphyrins coproporphyrin ii protorphyrin ix and uroporphyrin iii which are the primary endogenous photosensitizers responsible for bacterial inactivation hessling et al 2017 nevertheless given that the prevailing mechanism of visible light photo activation showed no disinfection fig 2a the increase of inactivation noted in fig 3a should be related with h2o2 in fact since h2o2 oxidizes intracellular fe2 to fe3 the absorbance spectra of fe3 would make it a candidate for photo reduction by a ligand to metal charge transfer lmct regenerating the fe2 content with simultaneous oxidative species production also in a photo sensitized process oxygen has also been found not to be key mediator of cell death gourmelon et al 1994 muela et al 2002 since inactivation can be achieved by sensitized reactions electron transfer in the presence of h2o2 a potent electron acceptor the generation of hydroxyl radicals may ensue eq 5 eq 5 e h 2 o 2 o h h o as a result the process that was previously non germicidal fig 2a vs 3a after the introduction of h2o2 which again alone was not germicidal is now reaching total inactivation in 6 h for 400 w m2 this must mean that a synergy exists between the photo generated transients by vis light and the role of h2o2 in the case of uva vis h2o2 experiments fig 3b shows that an increase of the irradiance enhances the e coli inactivation from 50 w m2 to 400 w m2 with simultaneous addition of h2o2 in the bulk compared to uva vis light alone a comparison of the light experiments with low irradiance 50 100 w m2 fig 2a shows that the addition of h2o2 in irradiated systems with very low irradiances can produce irreparable damage the experiments h2o2 200 w m2 and h2o2 400 w m2 result to a total inactivation at 300 min and 180 min effective disinfection time in presence of uva vis light respectively the pathway to inactivation must be different from vis light alone but includes the mechanism already induced since the change occurred faster and in lower irradiance most likely besides iron cycling the incapacitation of the h2o2 scavenging enzymes that takes place allows higher h2o2 concentration inside the cell and thus a faster photo fenton process h2o2 addition was performed in μm range which places its baseline action mode into the mode i killing based mainly in internal fenton reaction giannakis et al 2016b nevertheless the diffusion into the cell and the light exposure can offer conditions for effective internal photo fenton reaction and fast regeneration of ferric iron back to ferrous there are several possible pathways that explain this improvement in milli q water in the irradiance range from 50 to 400 wm 2 i direct membrane oxidation by h2o2 ii diffusion of external h2o2 into the cell iii increase of free iron release by light or ros assisted oxidation of the sulfur clusters and iv damage by uva light of the ros regulating enzymes i e catalases peroxidases and superoxide dismutases giannakis et al 2016a spuhler et al 2010 the combination of these mechanisms leads to an enhanced intracellular fenton that causes ros accumulation and consequent oxidative stress most of the works mentioned so far agree that the involved mechanism is in fact a light enhanced internal photo fenton reaction however in this study we report important differences as a function of the radiation spectra applied to the system fig 3 to summarize the introduction of h2o2 into the cell plays the role of electron acceptor under vis light and probably is partially scavenged while in uva vis light it plays this same role plus the fuel of the intracellular fenton process since the scavenging enzymes are inactivated 3 4 action mode of light assisted fe2 inactivation of e coli at low irradiance values fig 4 reflects the evolution of e coli concentration in the different light fe2 experiments using vis or uva vis radiation the results illustrate that the fe light system damages the cell from the beginning of the experiments independently of the spectral distribution it is however proportional to the irradiance the crucial point is that the inactivation pattern does not resemble the previous ones comparison of fig 4a with 2a or 3a and fig 4b with 2b or 3b since the kinetics of these systems do not include a lag period shoulder the processes that retain this scheme should be some of the ones that are not controlled by a cell defense mechanism hence an oxidative species like ho must be immediately formed even more in experiments with high irradiance values the presence of iron in the uva vis irradiated system fig 4b slightly hampers the inactivation process compared with the results of uva vis induced inactivation fig 2b most likely due to the interference of iron in the distribution of the uva vis radiation in the bulk furthermore the effect of uva radiation presence in the emitted spectrum is not a crucial parameter in the light fe2 process so the two groups of tests result to similar kinetics of e coli inactivation fig 4a vs 4b therefore it can be suggested that under the studied operational conditions irradiance and fe amount the driving force in the fe light systems is the iron presence which takes advantage both uva and visible light for either vis or uva vis light we attribute the inactivation enhancement to the higher presence of iron either inside or outside the cell addition of iron in the bulk inflicts important changes in the inactivation process according to the iron localization i e iron that is transported in the cell in the interface bacteria water or that stays in the bulk for the intracellular part upon light irradiation and subsequent the modification of the normal iron storage functions of the cell the ferrous iron has more opportunities to react with the intracellular ros leading to high intracellular inactivation events giannakis et al 2018 the intracellular iron acts as fuel for the fenton process that ensues upon light irradiation in the process described for light and light h2o2 addition however according to the data in fig 4a and 4b we have reasons to believe that an important part of the inactivation is attributed to extracellular water cell interfacial mechanisms exerted by the addition of iron the membrane bound fe undergoes lmct with bacterial membrane components l acting as a sacrificial electron donor process that might lead to their inactivation by itself eq 6 or in a more generalized scheme the production of radicals that ensues in parallel eqs 7 and 8 eq 6 f e c o o r 2 h v f e 2 c o 2 r eq 7 f e 3 l 3 h v l m c t f e 2 l o x eq 8 l o x o 2 l o x 2 o 2 furthermore as far as the extracellular processes are concerned at neutral ph iron solubility is very limited and precipitation to iron oxides soon ensues giannakis 2018 feso4 gets transformed to goethite and lepidocrocite oxides with a band gap of 2 1 ev cornell and schwertmann 2006 these oxides can either play the role of iron source from the siderophoric proteins or the photo dissolution get complexed with components of the bacterial cell wall or act as a semiconductor photocatalyst iron oxides were found to be potent semiconductors even in the visible range leading to bacterial inactivation in pure water sources ruales lonfat et al 2014 although the oxidative potential of the photo generated valence band holes h v b is too low to oxidize h2o or oh and generate ho it is possible that it h v b directly affect bacterial membrane components giannakis et al 2017 another pathway is via the generation of superoxide radical anion o 2 in the conduction band of the iron oxides which can attack bacterial cell wall components and also reduce fe3 to fe2 further fueling the system with the more readily reactive fe2 finally superoxide is converted to hydrogen peroxide or is oxidized to singlet oxygen inflicting further bacterial inactivation pathways as a provisional conclusion we propose that since the kinetics are similar since the photo induced fe assisted disinfection is mainly driven by the vis part of irradiation and the uva induced vulnerability that inactivates the scavenging enzymes is not exploited 3 5 action mode of the photo fenton process hv h2o2 fe2 on e coli inactivation at low irradiance values as it can be observed in fig 5 the simultaneous addition of both fenton reagents under light induces notable inactivation comparing to light only induced inactivation fig 2 light h2o2 systems fig 3 and light fe2 systems fig 4 the detrimental effect on e coli of simultaneous addition of iron and h2o2 is notable even in systems irradiated with very low irradiance specifically photo fenton inactivation of e coli is achieved in the vis h2o2 fe2 system from 200 w m2 and onwards higher than the isolated actions or 100 w m2 when 1 10 reagent ratio is added or the immediate participation of the photo fenton process in the uva vis irradiation due to the intracellular h2o2 generation notably an important effect of visible light is observed at 200 w m2 and 400 w m2 the fenton systems clearly demonstrated a superior disinfection power than vis h2o2 and vis fe2 systems fig 5 visible light panels vs 3a and 4a in order to explain a shift that important as the demonstrated one we have to take account the following facts firstly the big change in inactivation kinetics was measured for 200 and 400 w m2 this is similar to the vis h2o2 experiments so there could be a correlation between the two tests secondly the slight modification slower initial kinetics at low irradiances indicate that the vis fe action is not as profound most likely because fe is reacting with h2o2 in the extracellular media and not directly with the cell which delays that mode of direct inactivation observed nevertheless these two events combined lead to a total inactivation considerably higher than the observed in the isolated vis h2o2 and vis fe2 systems provisionally we can conclude that this might be the first instance of visible light driven photo fenton process for bacterial inactivation proposed in literature without the use of engineered catalysts to work in this wavelength range as far as the uva vis h2o2 fe2 is concerned a 6 log reduction is observed from 50 w m2 and above and a concurrent decrease in the necessary time for inactivation is observed when the irradiance is increased compared to the isolated uva vis uva vis h2o2 and the uva vis fe2 process an acceleration of the kinetics is observed and resembles more the kinetics of light alone or uva vis h2o2 than the kinetics observed in the uva vis fe2 process this implies that under uva vis irradiation and in presence of both h2o2 and fe2 the dominant action is an intracellular photo fenton process rather than a photosensitization such as in vis light light alone initiates the pathways which are enhanced by the addition of h2o2 and fe2 and a key to this enhancement is their transport into the cell where with catalases inactivated by uva light they can enhance the existing photo fenton process it was previously demonstrated giannakis et al 2018 that the fenton s reagents transport into the cell was crucial to internal photo inactivation making it the predominant action mode in photo fenton systems to inactivate e coli moreover the presence of h2o2 in the extracellular medium may lead to an increase in membrane permeability facilitating the diffusion of fe2 spuhler et al 2010 the bacterial disinfection by the fenton systems is a combination of extracellular oxidation and intracellular photo catalysis with high prevalence of the intracellular part giannakis et al 2018 eventually causing cellular dysfunction by oxidative stress ruales lonfat et al 2014 however the enhancement observed stems from the above mentioned combined action and the events that take place under vis light since it exists in the emitted spectra besides the intracellular enhancement pathways mentioned one should consider the simultaneous enhancement of the extracellular mechanisms since a part of fe2 and h2o2 react in the bulk the external reactive oxygen species produced by the photo fenton reaction especially hydroxyl radicals cause irreparable damage on the bacterial membrane in addition an important mechanism in light was found to be iron dependent and it is affected by the ph fe2 is rapidly oxidized to fe3 thus forming iron species such as oxides which are insoluble however fe3 irradiated with enough light undergoes photochemical reduction to fe2 completing the redox cycle of iron consequently reactive oxygen species are expected to be generated according to the eqs 3 and 4 and h o via the iron photo reduction eq 9 denotes surface reactions eq 9 f e 3 o h h 2 o 5 2 h 2 o h v l m c t f e 2 h 2 o 6 2 h o at near neutral conditions these reactions can take place in the surface of the iron oxides in a heterogeneous mode of action instead of the soluble iron species the photo fenton fuel is the solid particle in the solid water interface which reacts in diffusion controlled rates lower than the respective homogeneous process hence its lower participation compared to the intracellular pathways in order to summarize all the events described via the experimental findings we gather all the observed and postulated pathways in table 1 the actions of visible light are also present in the uva vis light conditions but evidently the higher energy photons of uva and the most critical pathways they affect mask the vis effect in most of the cases however given the differentiated effectiveness of each system the contribution of each parameter and the complexity of the disinfection events due to the simultaneous presence of all factors a deeper analysis will be performed to further dissociate the actual events during the photo fenton process 3 6 kinetic evaluation of the light assisted fe h2o2 mediated inactivation processes from the dark fenton to the photo fenton process and the influence of light spectrum in order to benchmark and compare the processes a kinetic evaluation of the results was implemented the photo fenton systems light h2o2 fe2 included in the present kinetic modelling are those that attain at least 3 logu of e coli reduction in 6 h as a minimum requirement for protected water sources by who world health organization 2007 to clarify the action mode of these fenton systems on e coli inactivation the kinetic modelling of experimental data is used in order to determine the effect of the type of light different irradiance values and spectra as well as the concentration of the fenton reagents the detailed graphs with the evolution of e coli concentration in fenton reagents light h2o2 fe2 systems irradiated by uva vis light and visible light in the range of 50 400 w m2 are included in supplementary material supplementary tables s1 and s2 summarize the kinetic parameters of e coli inactivation by the photo fenton process in all irradiance levels in three different amounts of fe h2o2 albeit in the same ratio and the fitting of the different kinetic models to the experimental data the parameters under scrutiny are the lag phase shoulder length sl and the maximum log linear inactivation k constant kmax an overview of the analysis is presented in table 2 in general the fitting to the models was reasonably good presented in further detail in supplementary tables s2 and s3 with their rmse values close to 0 and r2 values are close to 1 the tabular representation of the kinetic models table 2 show that the geeraerd model shoulder log linear described better the initial lag phase phenomena observed in the inactivation curves of the experimental data in most of the experimental conditions however the experiments with the highest concentration of fenton reagents 1 10 in mg l uva vis experiments with irradiances of 200 w m2 and 400 w m2 and fenton reagents 1 10 in mg l visible experiments with irradiance of 400 w m2 are described by a log linear fit this phenomenon indicates that the driving force of inactivation is the photo fenton process rather than the light itself since they lack shoulder light driven process and the effectiveness of the intracellular process relies onto the transport of reagents into cell and this process is mainly dependent to the amount of reagents added to the bulk at this point it would be interesting to assess the thresholds that actually define the process as fenton or photo fenton there are two aspects to be considered here the appropriateness of light irradiance value and the quantity of added reagents depending on the light source hence in order to perform a deeper analysis on the evolution of the photo fenton process in fig 6 we present a phenomenological analysis of the inactivation data acquired by the lab assays in order to dissociate the photo fenton related events we should remind here that i dark fenton fe h2o2 mg l ratio 1 10 caused negligible inactivation ii visible light alone was not germicidal 50 400 w m2 and iii uva vis started inflicting inactivation after 200 w m2 figs 1 2a and 2b respectively concerning the photo fenton process with the same reagent concentrations as the isolated tests 1 10 uva vis was always more germicidal than visible light driven fenton fig 6a the photo fenton reagents experiments at 50 and 100 w m2 did not show relevant disinfection power and e coli inactivation by external fenton is a slow process in these operational conditions furthermore uva appears to be more significant in the lower irradiance values we note here that a convergence that takes place after 200 w m2 in both the delay period sl and the inactivation rate kmax for the 1 10 ratio this means that independently from the spectral distribution of the radiation that reaches the bulk the fenton reagents systems need a minimum of photons to get activated and disinfect bacteria by either vis or uva vis driven photo fenton process since no inactivation takes place before 200 w m2 by light only and the two light distributions have a similar effect a closer look is given to the fenton aspects of the process in fig 6b comparing vis and uva vis powered fenton for the three amounts of reagents used we note that the processes converge after 0 5 5 ratio and are identical at 1 10 as measured by the delay period and the inactivation rate that follows an explanation to this point could be derived by the small amount of reagents easily scavenged assimilated by bacteria hence the absence of an actual photo fenton process combined with the previous facts we denote that i a 0 5 5 ratio of fe h2o2 was the minimum amount of reagents necessary to convert light mediated inactivation to an oxidative process fenton and ii 200 w m2 are necessary to convert the fenton to a photo fenton process however we note here that visible light driven inactivation is more affected by the concentration of the reagents since its prevailing mechanism is iron related a comparison of the fe2 assisted light kinetics of e coli inactivation fig 4 shows that the consumption of iron by fenton reaction allow cell auto reparation up until an irradiance value 50 100 w m2 regardless the distribution of wavelengths from which the enhancement of external ros are enough to cell damage improving both internal fenton and external oxidation process finally in fig 6c we assess the same conditions at 400 w m2 where except for the 0 1 1 reagents concentration the process is quasi identical in that case we get a similar delay period sl and different kmax which indicates the similar time for diminution of the cell s defenses but different inactivation rate afterwards this means that the combination of light and fenton reagents breaks down the cell defenses in a similar manner but the presence of uva has a further inactivating effect we postulate from the mechanisms already discussed that this should be attributed to the intracellular generation of h2o2 which further enhances the photo fenton process while vis light cannot achieve this effect although the cell damage starts to be relevant from the beginning of the experiment the addition of the reagents hampers the reparation mechanisms of bacteria since the shoulder length decreases when irradiance increases in the fenton system furthermore the evolution of sl and kmax as the concentration of reagents increases indicates that the threshold of irradiation and reagents concentration used before is surpassed and the processes are not controlled by direct light action but rather from the photo generation of oxidative species to further validate this point and expand towards a more realistic scenario a series of tests in similar conditions but using higher irradiance values and lake geneva water was performed only for uva vis light summarized in fig 7 as a general trend the photo fenton system mediated inactivation shifts from a concentration controlled to an irradiance controlled system while light irradiance increases the importance of the photo fenton reagents becomes lower however a change occurs in the baseline of the inactivation as the limit for effective solar inactivation is beyond 400 w m2 since lake water contains natural light absorbing compounds this change is reflected in the effective disinfection times nevertheless beyond this point there is photo saturation and no huge improvement takes place finally we verify once more that 0 5 5 mg l of fe h2o2 can be a sufficient amount to initiate the photo fenton process but for reasons that extend beyond the scope of the work and relate with the regrowth of natural pathogens ndounla et al 2013 1 10 additions would be recommended for a potential application 4 conclusions in this work we evidence the differences in the action mode of solar irradiated systems with without presence of the uva component on e coli inactivation we report the capability of photo disinfecting water carried out even at very low irradiation intensities and for the first time without the presence of uva radiation only if iron hydrogen peroxide or fenton reagent is added to the bulk although uva vis mediated disinfection is effective even at very low irradiance values the mechanisms initiated by visible light are not enough to inflict inactivation before a certain energy threshold nevertheless a small addition of fe and h2o2 restores the disinfecting capacity to levels comparable with uva vis mediated inactivation when h2o2 is added to the bulk at very low quantities it induces an important enhancement of the photo inactivation of e coli however the fact that a delay period remains indicates that we do not modify the dominant pathways to inactivation but rather enhance its action i e death by h2o2 and intracellular photo fenton process the action mode of the fe light processes on e coli inactivation is independent of the irradiation spectrum although the inactivation improves with increasing of radiation intensities the large absorption spectra allows fe related activity in a large margin introducing further oxidative mechanisms the simultaneous addition of low μμ concentrations of iron and hydrogen peroxide enhances e coli inactivation light systems h2o2 light systems and iron light systems even at low μm amounts as low as 0 1 1 mg l fe h2o2 ratios thus limiting the required exposure time and radiation intensity finally this study reveals that solar disinfection actually takes place from very low light irradiance values in clear waters even without the presence of uva radiation at the normal conditions studied in lake water solar disinfection that takes place in high irradiances is driving the inactivation process and the photo fenton is enhancing the already dominant mechanism however if very low irradiance values are expected overcast conditions or small light distribution the addition of at least 0 5 5 mg l fe h2o2 ratios would compensate the disinfection capacity of light ensure fast disinfection and halting of bacterial regrowth declaration of

18055,the aim of this research is to clarify the contribution of sunlight wavelengths irradiance and fe2 h2o2 during bacterial disinfection by the photo fenton process in clear surface waters we considered different solar spectrum distributions visible uva visible sub critical irradiances 0 400 w m2 focusing on the action modes of e coli inactivation by the constituents involved in the composite process at low μm reactants concentration fe2 h2o2 in in ultrapure mq water we report that solar disinfection improved with fenton reagents photo fenton process is a reality from very low light irradiance values 200 w m2 and made possible even without the presence of uva radiation even when using low quantities of the fenton reagents 0 5 mg l fe2 5 mg l h2o2 under light exposure h2o2 was found to augment the intracellular fenton process and fe2 to initiate further distinct oxidative actions finally validation was performed in lake geneva water over a wider irradiance range where the photo fenton process was found to be reagent dependent in low irradiance shifting to light driven in the higher values graphical abstract image 1 keywords photo fenton solar disinfection e coli light intensity kinetics water treatment 1 introduction the evolution of the fenton process since its conception in 1894 has witnessed tremendous leaps from its use as a decontamination process at acidic ph to a possible water purification process aided by the sun via the discovery that it can still work at near neutral ph values giannakis 2019 there is a rapidly growing literature on neutral ph fenton treatment which indicates that scientific community are focusing their interest to decrease the costs and drawbacks acidifying and neutralization of effluent of the fenton reaction conte et al 2016 de luca et al 2014 ortega gómez et al 2015 over the last years works on disinfection processes by modifications of the fenton reaction are performed considering the iron source homogeneous or heterogeneous garcía fernández et al 2012 rodríguez chueca et al 2016 ruales lonfat et al 2014 different type of light aguilar et al 2017 garcía fernández et al 2019 and inducing the advanced oxidation process by radiofrequencies and electrochemistry rodríguez chueca et al 2014 valero et al 2017b in addition some studies have been conducted on mild photo fenton process with low concentrations of reagents for water disinfection a research field that has gained considerable attention and was recently reviewed giannakis 2018 this process has been found efficient against a series of microorganisms such as bacteria viruses and other microorganisms present in different effluents the use of solar light as radiation source to induce the photo enhanced version of fenton is promising since the photo fenton reaction can be effectuated with low energy photons e g without artificial light sources in the near uv part of the spectrum thus photo fenton has potential as a low cost aop that can be realized under solar irradiation torrades et al 2004 this makes it a prospect that could be successfully applied in developing or sunny countries in the same context that the solar disinfection process sodis is performed mcguigan et al 2012 but envisioning its improvement by the fenton reaction the solar photo inactivation processes for water disinfection have proven to be more efficient when a higher solar energy dose is received in the system but the relationship between microorganism photo inactivation rate and solar exposure time wavelength exposure energy received or dose applied ortega gómez et al 2016 is actually far from straightforward in fact even the baseline process solar light is not always subject to the reciprocity law similar doses deriving from high irradiance short times are more effective than the ones deriving from the respective low irradiance long exposure times and temperature during treatment further complicates the issue giannakis et al 2015 furthermore the majority of the researches carried out with artificial solar radiation use solar irradiances from 400 to 500 w m2 castro alférez et al 2017a giannakis et al 2018 porras et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2015a 2015b and above following the recommendation of the sodis foundation but in a real application sometimes the climate conditions or the hourly interval in which the treatment is applied hinder reaching this irradiance value in addition besides the irradiance the wavelength of emission is highly affecting the bacterial inactivation pathways various studies have documented wavelength effects of e coli indicating that endogenous damage decreases steeply as wavelength increases in the solar range with wavelengths above 400 nm having minimal effect in the absence of external sensitizers nelson et al 2018 however hessling et al documented the photo inactivation of bacteria by endogenous photosensitizers by exposure to visible light of different wavelengths hessling et al 2017 the accumulation of findings on the action modes of solar light suggests that the action of light is not limited in uv induced mutations of the microorganisms genome but it rather initiates a series of oxidative events an intracellular photo fenton that leads to microorganism inactivation fisher and nelson 2014 giannakis et al 2018 previous works have suggested that the photo fenton process is actually the enhancement of the solar inflicted bacterial inactivation pathways by the addition of h2o2 and iron this results in the enhancement the external production of hydroxyl radicals in the bulk and a push in the internal reactive oxygen species ros imbalance bosshard et al 2010 the action mode of solar light against bacteria reveals the necessity of accumulation of endogenous damage before their inactivation giannakis et al 2016a mediated primarily by h2o2 accumulation castro alférez et al 2016 and its reaction with intracellular fe however more than a decade later from the first studies related to disinfection by fenton process at near neutral ph the process has been far from elucidated giannakis et al 2018 some mechanistic models of e coli inactivation have been recently developed namely by solar light and by the action of solar uv radiation and simultaneous solar mild heat occurring during sodis castro alférez et al 2017a 2017b the enhancement by fe and h2o2 then would add to the existing pathways as previously described the consideration of fenton reagents as participants during solar disinfection can also modify the wavelengths from which the photo assisted process inactivates bacteria iron absorbs light in longer wavelengths than the respective effective ones inside the cell giannakis et al 2016b however there is a lack of information about the effect of fenton reagents explaining e coli inactivation as a function of the irradiance and the emitted light spectra taking in consideration the above parameters namely the uncertainty of the irradiance due to the reciprocity law the different and complex phenomena taking place by uv and or visible light and the interplay of the aforementioned factors with fe h2o2 it is obvious that the photo fenton process is far from elucidated the aim of this research is to clarify the effect of sunlight spectra irradiance and fenton reagents addition separately or as a sum of events on the disinfection pathways that lead to e coli inactivation we employ a step wise constructed investigation of the different systems involved in the photo fenton process in order to treat the issues of i visible or uva vis light mediated disinfection ii the threshold where fenton reagents become germicidal and iii the point where this process is no longer considered fenton but photo fenton to achieve these goals we study the fenton process dark light alone visible or uva vis light light h2o2 light fe and light h2o2 fe photo fenton processes the inactivation of e coli is approached in a detailed kinetic investigation in order to assess the importance of each aforementioned component while we further attempt a mechanistic interpretation of the bacterial inactivation to contextualize our findings finally the tipping point where the fenton process is effectively converted to photo fenton is estimated and validation of the suggested mechanisms was effectuated in solar

direct germicidal uvb mechanisms and the photo lytic actions on h2o2 would need to be considered all irradiance values were measured and fixed after the addition of the possible filters global and uv

inactivation microbial inactivation curves can have different shapes according to the inactivation mechanism in the simplest case microbial inactivation vs time follows a linear decay although deviations such as shoulders or tails are commonly observed the phenomenon of an initial shoulder occurs when there is a lag phase in which a fraction of surviving microorganisms is maintained constant during the first instants of treatment followed by a linear decline the tailing off effect consists of an initial linear inactivation phase followed by a slow decrease in microbial populations when both phenomena occur the inactivation curve has sigmoidal shape in this research the use of kinetic models serves to check the viability of using these models to compare the behavior of e coli in function of the different parameters analyzed several authors have previously used the selected kinetic models to describe the inactivation of microbes in water by different treatments barbeau et al 1999 rodríguez chueca et al 2015a 2015b rodríguez chueca et al 2016 yoon jin lee et al 2002 younas et al 2014 the linear model and their modifications are applied to adjust the experimental data the linear model or chick watson model is a modification of chick model watson believed that it was possible to incorporate in the model the effect of the concentration of the disinfectant on the reaction rate pernitsky et al 1995 the linear model is given by eq 1 where k is the kinetic constant eq 1 ln n t n 0 kt in order to explain the deviations of the linear model it was modified so as to introduce shoulder and tail phenomenon geeraerd et al 2000 eq 2 describes the linear model with shoulder and with tail eq 2 n t n 0 n res e k max t e k max sl 1 e k max sl 1 e k max t n res in order to obtain the kinetic coefficients of each model described above it was necessary to adjust the experimental values to the corresponding equations by non linear regression techniques the parameters of the models were adjusted to equations using interactive algorithms based on the least squares method rodríguez chueca et al 2016 valero et al 2015 the solver and ginafit tools geeraerd and van impe inactivation model fitting tool geeraerd et al 2005 of the microsoft excel program were used in this study two fitting parameters were used to assess the quality of the fitting the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse only the fits with a value of at least r2 0 90 and with low standard error were considered in this research 3 results and discussion in order to dissociate the constituents of the composite photo fenton process the results will be presented following a stepwise construction dark processes light light h2o2 or fe light h2o2 fe photo fenton thus the processes will not be repeated in the subsequent steps 3 1 dark control experiments fig 1 represents the evolution of e coli concentration log cfu ml in absence of light the dark experiment without reagents did not exert any reduction on the bacteria population milli q water has no effect in bacterial viability in the 6 h experimental duration so any effects might be due to the die off of sensitive cells mainly attributed to the osmotic shock suffered when introduced in mq water furthermore although e coli endogenously generate h2o2 its scavenging is effective in proficient cells and does not affect its viability unless this balance is disturbed korshunov and imlay 2010 kumar and imlay 2013 seaver and imlay 2004 2001a the same results were obtained with the addition of h2o2 in the bulk hydrogen peroxide has a similar polarity to water which allows its diffusion into the bacteria and potentially damage the cell by oxidative strees via internal fenton reaction but the presence of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase ahp in growing cells and catalases kat in the cytosol of stationary phase e coli cells seaver and imlay 2001b results to its fast decomposition in stationary phase cells as in our tests mainly kate acts as an efficient protection against overload of this long living ros nelson et al 2018 however previous works showed that the intracellular h2o2 concentration is 20 compared to the external addition in scavenging proficient cells seaver and imlay 2001a two main categories of h2o2 concentrations can be suggested related with different pathways of damage giannakis et al 2016a low and high 1 3 mm concentration in this study a h2o2 concentration of 0 29 mm is added to the sample hence mainly intracellular h2o2 damage would be attained not membrane oxidation so the h2o2 presence in the bulk is not expected to induce cell damage uhl and dukan 2016 hence this mode action is evidently negibigble under the studied operational conditions concerning fe2 addition e coli inactivation was close to 1 logu 90 loss of cell viability in 6 h theoretically the addition of fe2 can have a bactericidal effect by itself since the ferrous ions can diffuse into the cells and promote an intracellular fenton process by the adventitious generation of h2o2 in the cell and the un sequestered fe spuhler et al 2010 at neutral ph the iron species present in solution is fe oh 0 2 aq this can form complexes with the negatively charged e coli cell despite its uneven distribution of positively and negatively charged groups on its cell wall e coli are known to have both charges but overall negative and it is logical to assume their complexation with iron gumy et al 2006 pignatello et al 2006 as such we have to consider the possibility that a part of the apparent reduction of cultivability might be attributed to the formation of fe bacteria coagulants which affect the estimation of the colony forming units after the natural process of iron oxidation by dissolved o2 from fe2 to fe3 the action mode on e coli inactivation changes mainly due to the precipitation of fe3 however even the dissolved iron is eventually transformed to iron oxide as a consequence of the near neutral ph conditions in absence of light nevertheless this might not stop the effect of fe as there were important observations related to iron oxides interaction with bacteria châtellier et al 2004 pouran et al 2014 promoting internal fenton as well finally the simultaneous addition of both reagents fe h2o2 inducing the fenton process didn t produce any significant effect in 6 h of treatment theoretically fe2 drives to the homogeneous fenton in which fe2 is oxidized to fe3 eq 3 eq 3 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h h o eq 4 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h h o 2 the kinetics of eq 4 is several orders of magnitude slower than the respective ones of eq 3 and thus eq 4 is the rate limiting step pignatello et al 2006 soon the predominant iron species in bulk is fe3 according to the iron speciation diagram at neutral ph fe oh 3 and fe oh 2 will be the predominant species pignatello et al 2006 fe3 may form oxides and precipitate demarchis et al 2015 the oxidized iron could possibly lead a heterogeneous fenton reaction but in 360 min the e coli concentration didn t decrease indicating a negligible contribution compared to the homogeneous phase we have to mention here that a comparison among iron addition and the fenton reagents experiments showed that the bacterial inactivation is much higher in the system fe2 dark 90 of inactivation than in the system fe2 h2o2 dark where fe2 is rapidly oxidized to fe3 fenton reaction sphuler et al also obtained that fe2 dark produced an e coli inactivation higher than the fenton process similar conditions spuhler et al 2010 3 2 effect of different light types on the inactivation mechanisms and the wavelength dependence of e coli inactivation pathways fig 2 reflects the evolution of e coli concentration in the different experiments carried out under light in presence of visible or uva vis irradiation in fig 2a the visible induced inactivation of e coli is negligible independently of the applied irradiance value in the range of 50 400 w m2 there is no photo inactivation of e coli contrary to the data reviewed by hessling et al related to photoinactivation of bacteria by visible light hessling et al 2017 our experimental conditions are either provide a low flux or photo reactivation manifests as an antagonistic process controlled by the photolyase enzyme activated in the vis region sihna and authoranonymous 2002 normally sensitization of porphyrins could lead to 1o2 generation and subsequently to intracellular lesions that would decrease the cell viability szocs et al 1999 but apparently here there is light limitation or antagonism the simulated solar induced inactivation results uva vis fig 2b show that e coli do not suffer from oxidative stress when the irradiance is in the range of 50 100 w m2 and similar results were achieved in vis light experiments however from 100 w m2 and onwards photo inactivation of e coli is observed so the defense mechanism is no longer sufficiently protective total inactivation is achieved after 6 h of uva vis light exposure at 400 w m2 the damage is related with either photodynamic or photo sensitized reactions regardless of the presence of oxygen for the latter case muela et al 2002 the initial shoulder of the inactivation curves fig 2b might be caused by many different reasons such as the presence of clumps of bacteria bad mixing etc geeraerd et al 2000 however in these operational conditions in the irradiated uva vis systems we assume that the main reason is the capacity of bacteria to withstand certain levels of damage reparation i e cell s defense capacity giannakis et al justified that the solar induced system using 600 w m2 presents delay phase due to the low irradiance applied higher value than the irradiance range used in this research furthermore the auto reparation time is decreasing proportionally to the irradiance from 100 w m2 hence it is a light controlled process giannakis et al 2018 however once the photo oxidative stress begins to manifest linear decay the slope of the inactivation curve is very similar in the range 200 400 w m2 so once the self defense capacity is outdone there is no strong dependence on the irradiance values as far as the mechanism of inactivation is concerned berney et al observed that as uva light dose increases e coli experiences a reduction of efflux pump activity and atp synthesis loss of membrane potential glucose uptake activity and cultivability and finally permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane berney m weilenmann h u 2006 the observed photo inactivation is due to the absorption of uva photons by endogenous photosensitizers such as cytochrome flavin tryptophan and other aromatic amino acids inducing photo oxidation reactions type i and ii which involve the formation of transient species and ros pfeifer et al 2005 ravanat et al 2001 and by the effect on catalases whose scavenging activity is inhibited eisenstark 1998 moreover we propose that an intracellular fenton process happens during uva vis exposure since h2o2 produced via cellular respiration or by activation of flavoenzymes reacts with iron released from different possible intracellular sources fe s clusters siderophores etc as a result the ros generated in photo oxidation and fenton reactions including the highly reactive ho attack dna rna lipids and proteins these chain reactions result in loss of cell functions mutations and block of dna replication cabiscol e tamarit j 2000 some studies demonstrate that ros and their accumulated oxidative damages at intracellular level are key in solar water disinfection castro alférez et al 2017a 2017b as a proof for the oxidative process taking place in our experiments the results of post irradiation monitoring show that no regrowth occurred for any experimental conditions zero values data not shown summarizing although the osmotic imbalance cannot be excluded spuhler et al 2010 valero et al 2017a light induced dna mutations would have been easily repaired and regrowth would manifest hence an oxidative process including ho and 1o2 must take place 3 3 action mode of light assisted h2o2 inactivation of e coli at low irradiance values fig 3 reflects the evolution of e coli concentration in the different experiments carried out in light h2o2 systems in presence of vis radiation or uva vis the vis h2o2 systems with irradiance in the range of 50 100 w m2 do not result in cell damage or alternatively the self defense cellular mechanisms are enough to cope with the stresses generated in these operational conditions however the synergy between h2o2 and visible light is clear from irradiances north of 100 w m2 since the cells are not able to repair the damage produced by visible radiation in presence of h2o2 hessling et al confirms the absorption of visible light by porphyrins coproporphyrin ii protorphyrin ix and uroporphyrin iii which are the primary endogenous photosensitizers responsible for bacterial inactivation hessling et al 2017 nevertheless given that the prevailing mechanism of visible light photo activation showed no disinfection fig 2a the increase of inactivation noted in fig 3a should be related with h2o2 in fact since h2o2 oxidizes intracellular fe2 to fe3 the absorbance spectra of fe3 would make it a candidate for photo reduction by a ligand to metal charge transfer lmct regenerating the fe2 content with simultaneous oxidative species production also in a photo sensitized process oxygen has also been found not to be key mediator of cell death gourmelon et al 1994 muela et al 2002 since inactivation can be achieved by sensitized reactions electron transfer in the presence of h2o2 a potent electron acceptor the generation of hydroxyl radicals may ensue eq 5 eq 5 e h 2 o 2 o h h o as a result the process that was previously non germicidal fig 2a vs 3a after the introduction of h2o2 which again alone was not germicidal is now reaching total inactivation in 6 h for 400 w m2 this must mean that a synergy exists between the photo generated transients by vis light and the role of h2o2 in the case of uva vis h2o2 experiments fig 3b shows that an increase of the irradiance enhances the e coli inactivation from 50 w m2 to 400 w m2 with simultaneous addition of h2o2 in the bulk compared to uva vis light alone a comparison of the light experiments with low irradiance 50 100 w m2 fig 2a shows that the addition of h2o2 in irradiated systems with very low irradiances can produce irreparable damage the experiments h2o2 200 w m2 and h2o2 400 w m2 result to a total inactivation at 300 min and 180 min effective disinfection time in presence of uva vis light respectively the pathway to inactivation must be different from vis light alone but includes the mechanism already induced since the change occurred faster and in lower irradiance most likely besides iron cycling the incapacitation of the h2o2 scavenging enzymes that takes place allows higher h2o2 concentration inside the cell and thus a faster photo fenton process h2o2 addition was performed in μm range which places its baseline action mode into the mode i killing based mainly in internal fenton reaction giannakis et al 2016b nevertheless the diffusion into the cell and the light exposure can offer conditions for effective internal photo fenton reaction and fast regeneration of ferric iron back to ferrous there are several possible pathways that explain this improvement in milli q water in the irradiance range from 50 to 400 wm 2 i direct membrane oxidation by h2o2 ii diffusion of external h2o2 into the cell iii increase of free iron release by light or ros assisted oxidation of the sulfur clusters and iv damage by uva light of the ros regulating enzymes i e catalases peroxidases and superoxide dismutases giannakis et al 2016a spuhler et al 2010 the combination of these mechanisms leads to an enhanced intracellular fenton that causes ros accumulation and consequent oxidative stress most of the works mentioned so far agree that the involved mechanism is in fact a light enhanced internal photo fenton reaction however in this study we report important differences as a function of the radiation spectra applied to the system fig 3 to summarize the introduction of h2o2 into the cell plays the role of electron acceptor under vis light and probably is partially scavenged while in uva vis light it plays this same role plus the fuel of the intracellular fenton process since the scavenging enzymes are inactivated 3 4 action mode of light assisted fe2 inactivation of e coli at low irradiance values fig 4 reflects the evolution of e coli concentration in the different light fe2 experiments using vis or uva vis radiation the results illustrate that the fe light system damages the cell from the beginning of the experiments independently of the spectral distribution it is however proportional to the irradiance the crucial point is that the inactivation pattern does not resemble the previous ones comparison of fig 4a with 2a or 3a and fig 4b with 2b or 3b since the kinetics of these systems do not include a lag period shoulder the processes that retain this scheme should be some of the ones that are not controlled by a cell defense mechanism hence an oxidative species like ho must be immediately formed even more in experiments with high irradiance values the presence of iron in the uva vis irradiated system fig 4b slightly hampers the inactivation process compared with the results of uva vis induced inactivation fig 2b most likely due to the interference of iron in the distribution of the uva vis radiation in the bulk furthermore the effect of uva radiation presence in the emitted spectrum is not a crucial parameter in the light fe2 process so the two groups of tests result to similar kinetics of e coli inactivation fig 4a vs 4b therefore it can be suggested that under the studied operational conditions irradiance and fe amount the driving force in the fe light systems is the iron presence which takes advantage both uva and visible light for either vis or uva vis light we attribute the inactivation enhancement to the higher presence of iron either inside or outside the cell addition of iron in the bulk inflicts important changes in the inactivation process according to the iron localization i e iron that is transported in the cell in the interface bacteria water or that stays in the bulk for the intracellular part upon light irradiation and subsequent the modification of the normal iron storage functions of the cell the ferrous iron has more opportunities to react with the intracellular ros leading to high intracellular inactivation events giannakis et al 2018 the intracellular iron acts as fuel for the fenton process that ensues upon light irradiation in the process described for light and light h2o2 addition however according to the data in fig 4a and 4b we have reasons to believe that an important part of the inactivation is attributed to extracellular water cell interfacial mechanisms exerted by the addition of iron the membrane bound fe undergoes lmct with bacterial membrane components l acting as a sacrificial electron donor process that might lead to their inactivation by itself eq 6 or in a more generalized scheme the production of radicals that ensues in parallel eqs 7 and 8 eq 6 f e c o o r 2 h v f e 2 c o 2 r eq 7 f e 3 l 3 h v l m c t f e 2 l o x eq 8 l o x o 2 l o x 2 o 2 furthermore as far as the extracellular processes are concerned at neutral ph iron solubility is very limited and precipitation to iron oxides soon ensues giannakis 2018 feso4 gets transformed to goethite and lepidocrocite oxides with a band gap of 2 1 ev cornell and schwertmann 2006 these oxides can either play the role of iron source from the siderophoric proteins or the photo dissolution get complexed with components of the bacterial cell wall or act as a semiconductor photocatalyst iron oxides were found to be potent semiconductors even in the visible range leading to bacterial inactivation in pure water sources ruales lonfat et al 2014 although the oxidative potential of the photo generated valence band holes h v b is too low to oxidize h2o or oh and generate ho it is possible that it h v b directly affect bacterial membrane components giannakis et al 2017 another pathway is via the generation of superoxide radical anion o 2 in the conduction band of the iron oxides which can attack bacterial cell wall components and also reduce fe3 to fe2 further fueling the system with the more readily reactive fe2 finally superoxide is converted to hydrogen peroxide or is oxidized to singlet oxygen inflicting further bacterial inactivation pathways as a provisional conclusion we propose that since the kinetics are similar since the photo induced fe assisted disinfection is mainly driven by the vis part of irradiation and the uva induced vulnerability that inactivates the scavenging enzymes is not exploited 3 5 action mode of the photo fenton process hv h2o2 fe2 on e coli inactivation at low irradiance values as it can be observed in fig 5 the simultaneous addition of both fenton reagents under light induces notable inactivation comparing to light only induced inactivation fig 2 light h2o2 systems fig 3 and light fe2 systems fig 4 the detrimental effect on e coli of simultaneous addition of iron and h2o2 is notable even in systems irradiated with very low irradiance specifically photo fenton inactivation of e coli is achieved in the vis h2o2 fe2 system from 200 w m2 and onwards higher than the isolated actions or 100 w m2 when 1 10 reagent ratio is added or the immediate participation of the photo fenton process in the uva vis irradiation due to the intracellular h2o2 generation notably an important effect of visible light is observed at 200 w m2 and 400 w m2 the fenton systems clearly demonstrated a superior disinfection power than vis h2o2 and vis fe2 systems fig 5 visible light panels vs 3a and 4a in order to explain a shift that important as the demonstrated one we have to take account the following facts firstly the big change in inactivation kinetics was measured for 200 and 400 w m2 this is similar to the vis h2o2 experiments so there could be a correlation between the two tests secondly the slight modification slower initial kinetics at low irradiances indicate that the vis fe action is not as profound most likely because fe is reacting with h2o2 in the extracellular media and not directly with the cell which delays that mode of direct inactivation observed nevertheless these two events combined lead to a total inactivation considerably higher than the observed in the isolated vis h2o2 and vis fe2 systems provisionally we can conclude that this might be the first instance of visible light driven photo fenton process for bacterial inactivation proposed in literature without the use of engineered catalysts to work in this wavelength range as far as the uva vis h2o2 fe2 is concerned a 6 log reduction is observed from 50 w m2 and above and a concurrent decrease in the necessary time for inactivation is observed when the irradiance is increased compared to the isolated uva vis uva vis h2o2 and the uva vis fe2 process an acceleration of the kinetics is observed and resembles more the kinetics of light alone or uva vis h2o2 than the kinetics observed in the uva vis fe2 process this implies that under uva vis irradiation and in presence of both h2o2 and fe2 the dominant action is an intracellular photo fenton process rather than a photosensitization such as in vis light light alone initiates the pathways which are enhanced by the addition of h2o2 and fe2 and a key to this enhancement is their transport into the cell where with catalases inactivated by uva light they can enhance the existing photo fenton process it was previously demonstrated giannakis et al 2018 that the fenton s reagents transport into the cell was crucial to internal photo inactivation making it the predominant action mode in photo fenton systems to inactivate e coli moreover the presence of h2o2 in the extracellular medium may lead to an increase in membrane permeability facilitating the diffusion of fe2 spuhler et al 2010 the bacterial disinfection by the fenton systems is a combination of extracellular oxidation and intracellular photo catalysis with high prevalence of the intracellular part giannakis et al 2018 eventually causing cellular dysfunction by oxidative stress ruales lonfat et al 2014 however the enhancement observed stems from the above mentioned combined action and the events that take place under vis light since it exists in the emitted spectra besides the intracellular enhancement pathways mentioned one should consider the simultaneous enhancement of the extracellular mechanisms since a part of fe2 and h2o2 react in the bulk the external reactive oxygen species produced by the photo fenton reaction especially hydroxyl radicals cause irreparable damage on the bacterial membrane in addition an important mechanism in light was found to be iron dependent and it is affected by the ph fe2 is rapidly oxidized to fe3 thus forming iron species such as oxides which are insoluble however fe3 irradiated with enough light undergoes photochemical reduction to fe2 completing the redox cycle of iron consequently reactive oxygen species are expected to be generated according to the eqs 3 and 4 and h o via the iron photo reduction eq 9 denotes surface reactions eq 9 f e 3 o h h 2 o 5 2 h 2 o h v l m c t f e 2 h 2 o 6 2 h o at near neutral conditions these reactions can take place in the surface of the iron oxides in a heterogeneous mode of action instead of the soluble iron species the photo fenton fuel is the solid particle in the solid water interface which reacts in diffusion controlled rates lower than the respective homogeneous process hence its lower participation compared to the intracellular pathways in order to summarize all the events described via the experimental findings we gather all the observed and postulated pathways in table 1 the actions of visible light are also present in the uva vis light conditions but evidently the higher energy photons of uva and the most critical pathways they affect mask the vis effect in most of the cases however given the differentiated effectiveness of each system the contribution of each parameter and the complexity of the disinfection events due to the simultaneous presence of all factors a deeper analysis will be performed to further dissociate the actual events during the photo fenton process 3 6 kinetic evaluation of the light assisted fe h2o2 mediated inactivation processes from the dark fenton to the photo fenton process and the influence of light spectrum in order to benchmark and compare the processes a kinetic evaluation of the results was implemented the photo fenton systems light h2o2 fe2 included in the present kinetic modelling are those that attain at least 3 logu of e coli reduction in 6 h as a minimum requirement for protected water sources by who world health organization 2007 to clarify the action mode of these fenton systems on e coli inactivation the kinetic modelling of experimental data is used in order to determine the effect of the type of light different irradiance values and spectra as well as the concentration of the fenton reagents the detailed graphs with the evolution of e coli concentration in fenton reagents light h2o2 fe2 systems irradiated by uva vis light and visible light in the range of 50 400 w m2 are included in supplementary material supplementary tables s1 and s2 summarize the kinetic parameters of e coli inactivation by the photo fenton process in all irradiance levels in three different amounts of fe h2o2 albeit in the same ratio and the fitting of the different kinetic models to the experimental data the parameters under scrutiny are the lag phase shoulder length sl and the maximum log linear inactivation k constant kmax an overview of the analysis is presented in table 2 in general the fitting to the models was reasonably good presented in further detail in supplementary tables s2 and s3 with their rmse values close to 0 and r2 values are close to 1 the tabular representation of the kinetic models table 2 show that the geeraerd model shoulder log linear described better the initial lag phase phenomena observed in the inactivation curves of the experimental data in most of the experimental conditions however the experiments with the highest concentration of fenton reagents 1 10 in mg l uva vis experiments with irradiances of 200 w m2 and 400 w m2 and fenton reagents 1 10 in mg l visible experiments with irradiance of 400 w m2 are described by a log linear fit this phenomenon indicates that the driving force of inactivation is the photo fenton process rather than the light itself since they lack shoulder light driven process and the effectiveness of the intracellular process relies onto the transport of reagents into cell and this process is mainly dependent to the amount of reagents added to the bulk at this point it would be interesting to assess the thresholds that actually define the process as fenton or photo fenton there are two aspects to be considered here the appropriateness of light irradiance value and the quantity of added reagents depending on the light source hence in order to perform a deeper analysis on the evolution of the photo fenton process in fig 6 we present a phenomenological analysis of the inactivation data acquired by the lab assays in order to dissociate the photo fenton related events we should remind here that i dark fenton fe h2o2 mg l ratio 1 10 caused negligible inactivation ii visible light alone was not germicidal 50 400 w m2 and iii uva vis started inflicting inactivation after 200 w m2 figs 1 2a and 2b respectively concerning the photo fenton process with the same reagent concentrations as the isolated tests 1 10 uva vis was always more germicidal than visible light driven fenton fig 6a the photo fenton reagents experiments at 50 and 100 w m2 did not show relevant disinfection power and e coli inactivation by external fenton is a slow process in these operational conditions furthermore uva appears to be more significant in the lower irradiance values we note here that a convergence that takes place after 200 w m2 in both the delay period sl and the inactivation rate kmax for the 1 10 ratio this means that independently from the spectral distribution of the radiation that reaches the bulk the fenton reagents systems need a minimum of photons to get activated and disinfect bacteria by either vis or uva vis driven photo fenton process since no inactivation takes place before 200 w m2 by light only and the two light distributions have a similar effect a closer look is given to the fenton aspects of the process in fig 6b comparing vis and uva vis powered fenton for the three amounts of reagents used we note that the processes converge after 0 5 5 ratio and are identical at 1 10 as measured by the delay period and the inactivation rate that follows an explanation to this point could be derived by the small amount of reagents easily scavenged assimilated by bacteria hence the absence of an actual photo fenton process combined with the previous facts we denote that i a 0 5 5 ratio of fe h2o2 was the minimum amount of reagents necessary to convert light mediated inactivation to an oxidative process fenton and ii 200 w m2 are necessary to convert the fenton to a photo fenton process however we note here that visible light driven inactivation is more affected by the concentration of the reagents since its prevailing mechanism is iron related a comparison of the fe2 assisted light kinetics of e coli inactivation fig 4 shows that the consumption of iron by fenton reaction allow cell auto reparation up until an irradiance value 50 100 w m2 regardless the distribution of wavelengths from which the enhancement of external ros are enough to cell damage improving both internal fenton and external oxidation process finally in fig 6c we assess the same conditions at 400 w m2 where except for the 0 1 1 reagents concentration the process is quasi identical in that case we get a similar delay period sl and different kmax which indicates the similar time for diminution of the cell s defenses but different inactivation rate afterwards this means that the combination of light and fenton reagents breaks down the cell defenses in a similar manner but the presence of uva has a further inactivating effect we postulate from the mechanisms already discussed that this should be attributed to the intracellular generation of h2o2 which further enhances the photo fenton process while vis light cannot achieve this effect although the cell damage starts to be relevant from the beginning of the experiment the addition of the reagents hampers the reparation mechanisms of bacteria since the shoulder length decreases when irradiance increases in the fenton system furthermore the evolution of sl and kmax as the concentration of reagents increases indicates that the threshold of irradiation and reagents concentration used before is surpassed and the processes are not controlled by direct light action but rather from the photo generation of oxidative species to further validate this point and expand towards a more realistic scenario a series of tests in similar conditions but using higher irradiance values and lake geneva water was performed only for uva vis light summarized in fig 7 as a general trend the photo fenton system mediated inactivation shifts from a concentration controlled to an irradiance controlled system while light irradiance increases the importance of the photo fenton reagents becomes lower however a change occurs in the baseline of the inactivation as the limit for effective solar inactivation is beyond 400 w m2 since lake water contains natural light absorbing compounds this change is reflected in the effective disinfection times nevertheless beyond this point there is photo saturation and no huge improvement takes place finally we verify once more that 0 5 5 mg l of fe h2o2 can be a sufficient amount to initiate the photo fenton process but for reasons that extend beyond the scope of the work and relate with the regrowth of natural pathogens ndounla et al 2013 1 10 additions would be recommended for a potential application 4 conclusions in this work we evidence the differences in the action mode of solar irradiated systems with without presence of the uva component on e coli inactivation we report the capability of photo disinfecting water carried out even at very low irradiation intensities and for the first time without the presence of uva radiation only if iron hydrogen peroxide or fenton reagent is added to the bulk although uva vis mediated disinfection is effective even at very low irradiance values the mechanisms initiated by visible light are not enough to inflict inactivation before a certain energy threshold nevertheless a small addition of fe and h2o2 restores the disinfecting capacity to levels comparable with uva vis mediated inactivation when h2o2 is added to the bulk at very low quantities it induces an important enhancement of the photo inactivation of e coli however the fact that a delay period remains indicates that we do not modify the dominant pathways to inactivation but rather enhance its action i e death by h2o2 and intracellular photo fenton process the action mode of the fe light processes on e coli inactivation is independent of the irradiation spectrum although the inactivation improves with increasing of radiation intensities the large absorption spectra allows fe related activity in a large margin introducing further oxidative mechanisms the simultaneous addition of low μμ concentrations of iron and hydrogen peroxide enhances e coli inactivation light systems h2o2 light systems and iron light systems even at low μm amounts as low as 0 1 1 mg l fe h2o2 ratios thus limiting the required exposure time and radiation intensity finally this study reveals that solar disinfection actually takes place from very low light irradiance values in clear waters even without the presence of uva radiation at the normal conditions studied in lake water solar disinfection that takes place in high irradiances is driving the inactivation process and the photo fenton is enhancing the already dominant mechanism however if very low irradiance values are expected overcast conditions or small light distribution the addition of at least 0 5 5 mg l fe h2o2 ratios would compensate the disinfection capacity of light ensure fast disinfection and halting of bacterial regrowth declaration of

18056,the granulation of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox biomass plays a key role in high rate performance of upflow type anammox reactors however the formation of cavitation inside granules may result in sludge flotation problem which negatively affects the operation stability for quantitative evaluation of the anammox granules flotation in upflow reactors an integrated mathematical model was formulated based on the principles that the limitation of substrate diffusion would result in bacterial starvation lysis and subsequently aiding the formation of cavitation in the inner zone of granules the proposed model is used to investigate the possible mechanism of cavitation formation and granules flotation the combined modelling and experimental results showed that the model predictions matched well with the actual floating behavior of granules r 2 0 83 for settled sludge and 0 76 for floating sludge based on the model results the granule flotation could be divided into three zones namely i no flotation zone no flotation occurrence ii transition zone flotation with a part of granules and iii flotation zone inevitable flotation occurrence the floating behavior of granules was mainly influenced by granule diameter 2 5 4 5 mm and substrate concentration no2 n 50 250 mg l in the transition zone the optimum granule diameter to avoid flotation but with excellent settling performance was identified around 2 5 mm additionally the granule size is more sensitivity to flotation than substrate concentration hence controlling the size of granules is more important

gas and little nitrate as by product under anoxic conditions strous et al 1998 this autotrophic nitrogen removal process has gained extensive attention in recent years tang et al 2017 baeten et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 in comparison to conventional nitrification denitrification process anammox does not require exogenous carbon source and oxygen thus significantly reducing its operational cost kartal et al 2010 lotti et al 2012 feng et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 sludge granulation is capable of retaining more biomass and conducting synergistic actions among various bacterial communities inside granules tang et al 2011 winkler et al 2018 kang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 consequently enhancing efficiency of anammox and protecting against changing environmental conditions ni et al 2014 hou et al 2015 lin and wang 2017 xu et al 2019 unfortunately flotation of anammox granular sludge would occur spontaneously at high nitrogen loading rates nlr especially in upflow granular sludge bioreactors tang et al 2009 2017 chen et al 2010 2014 lu et al 2015 song et al 2017 the flotation subsequently leads to the biomass washout and even results in the failure of nitrogen removal performance of anammox bioreactors tang et al 2009 campos et al 2017 song et al 2017 wang et al 2018b chen et al 2019 cavitation in the inner of anammox granules has been reported to be the key reason for granule flotation chen et al 2010 lu et al 2012 campos et al 2017 manonmani and joseph 2018 however these researches were mainly based on operational observations and experimental measurements which can neither calculate the volume of cavitation nor assess the granule flotation actually the cavitation is hard to be determined experimentally mathematical modelling is a powerful tool to understand the complex processes that cannot be directly observed through experiments ni and yu 2010 su et al 2013 baeten et al 2019 although some equations concerning anammox flotation were proposed most of them were empirical for example lu et al 2012 obtained an experience equation between cavitation volume and diameter by cubic fitting campos et al 2017 explained the flotation of granular biomass based on kinetic stoichiometry results which seems not to better explain the cases with large sized granules at low substrate concentration generally the limitation of substrate diffusion in granules was not included in these flotation studies the cavity formation and its correlation to flotation cannot been integrated into these models either the force analysis of buoyancy v s settling is directly related with the sludge flotation issue the granules in water receive upward forces mainly the buoyancy f b and downward forces mainly the gravity f g tang et al 2009 the formation of cavity inside granule leads to decrease in f g or average density thus when the volume of cavity increases to a certain value resulting in f g f b granule will float on water surface for large diameter granules there is a penetration limit inside granule named as critical penetration length lc as shown in fig s1 when the radius r is larger than lc i e r lc microorganisms within zones of r lc would be gradually autolyzed which consequently results in formation of cavity inside the granules wang et al 2017 2019 such situation would lead to reduced f g or density of granule which ultimately trigger granule flotation meanwhile within zones of penetration limit lc a part of dinitrogen gas produced by anammox bacteria might be released into exterior of granule through gas tunnel the other part is trapped in the cavity due to some gas tunnels blocked by extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by bacteria chen et al 2010 wang et al 2018a to our knowledge few studies have been reported to interpret the above elucidated mechanism and then construct a mathematical model quantitatively evaluating the sludge flotation behavior in this study a novel integrated mathematical model was developed based on the above elucidated flotation mechanism the main aim was to estimate the cavitation size of anammox granule at different operating conditions and granule diameters as well as to reveal the relationship between the cavitation and behavior of granules flotation the guidelines for the operation of upflow granular sludge bioreactor in order to avoid granule flotation are discussed as well 2 materials and methods 2 1 anammox reactor and synthetic wastewater the anammox granular sludge were taken from the bottom and top zones in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor which had been successfully operated for 3 years in laboratory with nitrogen loading rate nlr higher than 5 kg m3 d the plexiglas made uasb 5 cm inner diameter had a total volume of 1 2 l and working volume of 1 0 l the synthetic wastewater composition used in the study is presented in table s2 tang et al 2011 during the two months of sampling period the reactor was stably operated with influent nh4 n of 247 15 mg l no2 n of 226 20 mg l respectively the effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were 30 3 6 4 5 0 4 and 67 2 0 mg l with nh4 n and no2 n removal efficiencies of 91 and 99 respectively the stoichiometric ratio of ammonium conversion to nitrite removal was 1 1 02 0 04 indicating the steady state and typical anammox reaction 2 2 analytical methods the concentration of three n species including ammonium nh4 n nitrite no2 n and nitrate no3 n were measured according to standard methods apha 2017 the diameter of the anammox granules was determined by matlab 2017b image processing as shown in supplementary fig s2 anammox granular sludge images were taken by digital camera lympus pen lite e pl5 17 mm f1 8 china the density and settling velocity of anammox granules were measured following the protocol described by lu et al 2012 specific anammox activity saa was determined according to the procedures given by yu et al 2019 diversity of microbial communities was analyzed by high throughput pyrosequencing song et al 2017 feng et al 2020 and transmission electron microscopy tem was performed according to the protocol described in previous studies tang et al 2019 3 model development 3 1 general assumptions the model described here has the following basic assumptions first the anammox granules are considered in spheres as frequently reported ni et al 2009 tang et al 2011 campos et al 2017 and the generated cavitations are also spherical correspondingly second the distributions of density and biomass in the non cavity zone are considered to be uniform and constant which is usually used in granular sludge modelling ni et al 2009 tang et al 2013 the substrate radial diffusion in granules could be described by fick s law ni et al 2009 the fluid dynamics influence on flotation chen et al 2014 wang et al 2017 has been integrated into the substrate nh4 n or no2 n diffusion coefficients which were taken from ni et al 2009 where the anammox operation dynamics were similar to the present study mass transfer resistance from the bulk liquid to the granule surface could be negligible as reported li and liu 2005 and therefore the substrate concentration on the granule surface is equal to that of presenting in the bulk liquid anammox reaction dominates in the granules in high loaded anammox reactors so the other bioprocesses were neglected in this model the procedures of the modelling consist of 6 steps fig 1 step 1 determine critical substrate concentration and diameter of granule step 2 calculate substrate micro profile inside granule step 3 calculate critical cavity size step 4 calculate simulated cavity size step 5 assess flotation and step 6 calibrate and predict 3 2 reaction diffusion equations at steady state the distribution of the substrates ammonium and nitrite inside the granules can be calculated using reaction diffusion equation benefield and molz 1983 li and liu 2005 perez et al 2005 ni et al 2009 the equations that expressed as coupled second order nonlinear ordinary differential equations ode are described below 1a d n h 4 n d 2 s r n h 4 n d r 2 2 r d s r n h 4 n d r υ r 0 d n o 2 n d 2 s r

concentration in the bulk liquid for component of i nh4 n or no2 n k i is half saturation constant for component i k is the proportionality constant ρ x is realistic density of a granule with cavitation d i is the effective diffusivity of i y is yield coefficients for anammox growth the values of parameters were summarized in table s1 to reduce the complexity of the model calculation eq 1a was simplified as a second order nonlinear ode with a single substrate limited which describes single substrate transfer and consumption inside the granule thus eq 1a can be rewritten as follows 1b d

1 critical cavitation size gravity the gravity of granule containing cavitation could be defined by eq 4 4 f g m g π 6 ρ b d j 3 d j r 3 g where f g is gravity of granule d j is equivalent granule diameter containing cavitation mm d j r is equivalent cavitation diameter mm ρ b is density of granule without cavitation and the g is the gravitational constant 9 8 m s2 buoyancy under the steady state the buoyancy of the granule from liquid phase was only related to the granule s volume it is expressed as follows 5 f b ρ w π 6 d j 3 g where f b is buoyancy of granule ρ w is density of the related fluid the fluid refers to water in this work when cavitation size inside the granule increased to a critical value that could result in a lower gravity f g than buoyancy f b i e f g f b the granule started to float otherwise the granular sludge would settle down eqs 6 and 7 could be deduced to calculate the critical cavitation size d j o 6 f g f b substituting eqs 4 5 into eq 6 gave 7 d j o d j ρ b ρ w ρ b 3 during the calculation of granular gravity the gravity of nitrogen gas trapped into the granule was considered negligible here d j o represents critical cavitation size causing flotation the different diameter symbols are illustrated in fig s1 3 3 2 simulated cavitation size it is hypothesized that the limitation of substrate penetration might cause the starvation of bacterial communities living at the core of the granule the long term starvation may lead to cellular lysis a cavity holding gas is developed inside the granule thus it is speculated that the microorganisms on the edge of the cavity may be in endogenous respiration state the situation can be expressed as follows 8 μ r k d here k d is the decay rate coefficient of anammox bacteria substituting eq 3b with eq 8 gives 9 μ r μ max s r i k i s r i k d then the critical substrate concentration scrit i forming cavitation is 10 s c r i t i k i k d μ i k d here scrit i refers to the critical substrate concentration for component i this value is only related to the kinetic characteristics of anammox bacteria the simulated cavitation diameter d j r of the granular sludge would be determined by combining equations eq 1b with eq 10 additionally the d j r varied at different granular diameters and bulk substrate concentrations thereby when d j r d j o or scrit i beyond s j o corresponding substrate concentration of d j o the granule would float and otherwise not 3 4 modification of settling velocity based on simulated cavitation size 1 granule density according to granular sludge mass balance eq 11 can be obtained as follows 11 ρ s π 6 d j 3 ρ b π 6 d j 3 d j r 3 after simplifying it can be rewritten as eq 12 12 ρ s ρ b d j 3 d j r 3 d j 3 here ρ s is the real granule density with cavitation as described above the real density of granule is closely related to the cavitation size that depends on granule diameter and bulk substrate concentration 2 settling velocity the mass shape factor ψ m a s s and shape correction factor φ are introduced to conveniently describe different characteristic diameters of the granular sludge bouwman et al 2004 lu et al 2013 thus eq 13 can be expressed as follows 13 d m ψ m d p d a φ d p where d m and d a are the mass diameter and the actual diameter of granular sludge respectively d p is the projected area equivalent sphere diameter here d j d m ψ m d p therefore eq 12 can be rewritten 14 ρ s ρ b ψ m 3 d p 3 d j r 3 ψ m 3 d p 3 the force balance of a granule containing cavitation in a constant velocity free settling process can be rewritten as follows lu et al 2013 15 π 6 d m 3 ρ s g π 6 d m 3 ρ w g c d π d p 3 4 ρ w u 2 2 substituting eq 13 into eq 15 it can be obtained as follows 16 u 4 g ρ s ρ w d p ψ m 3 3 c d ρ w the reynold number re p of a spherical granule in a free settling process can be calculated by eq 17 generally the reynold numbers of anammox granules were between 0 2 and 500 lu et al 2013 17 r e p u d a ρ w δ here δ is dynamic viscosity coefficient of water in case of r e p 2 the movement of granules occur in a layered zone thus the relationship between c d drag coefficient of granule and reynold number can be described as follows perry and green 2007 18 c d 24 r e p then the settling velocity u of granular sludge can be obtained 19a u ρ s ρ w ψ m 3 φ g 18 μ d p 2 in case of 2 r e p 10 3 the movement of granule falls into turbulent transition zone allen district thus the relationship between c d and reynold numbers can be described as follows perry and green 2007 20 c d 18 5 re p 0 6 then the settling velocity of granular sludge can be expressed as 19b u 1 4 4 g ρ s ρ w ψ m 3 φ 0 6 d p 1 6 3 18 5 μ 0 6 ρ w 0 4 the settling velocity of a granule can be calculated by various formulae eq 19a or eq 19b based on the hit and trial method the calculation is accomplished by using the matlab 2017b during the subsequent modelling the projected area equivalent sphere diameter d p was considered as an apparent indicator for the final results because it is easier to understand and can be determined in reactor operation the interim parameter of d j or mass diameter d m were taken as calculating diameters 3 5 the simulation of granular growth and flotation the microorganism growth within granular sludge leads to increase in granule diameter apparently ni and yu 2010 su et al 2013 based on mass balance it is supposed that the biomass of net growth in the non cavity zone is the same as the increased part of diameter containing one thereby eq 21 can be deduced as follows at t to t dt and r to dr δ biomass n o n c a v i t y biomass δ r then 21 r j r j 1 r j 1 r r j 1 μ r k d r 2 d r r j 1 2 δ t m m 2 3 n the r j r refers to cavitation radius corresponding to granular diameter of d j mm eq 21 can be solved by numerical integration on matlab 2017b 4 results and discussion 4 1 experimental analysis of the granule diameter and substrate concentration distribution in the reactor the settled and floating anammox granules were collected from the bottom and top of the lab scale uasb reactor respectively as shown in figs 2 a and 2b the diameter distribution of these collected granules was determined as shown in fig s3 the distribution of the granule diameter obeys the normal distribution as indicated by the distribution hypothesis test employing the lillietest built in function of matlab 2017b the mathematical expectation of the normal probability distribution curve fig s3 implied that the respective average diameters were 2 46 and 3 06 mm for the settled and floating anammox granules in the top and bottom zones of the reactor respectively as anticipated anammox granules with smaller size present in the bottom of the reactor can effectively occupy most of the space which enhances the contact probability with substrates resulting in strong mass transfer ability wang et al 2018a nonetheless too small size granules may increase packing density of granules accompanying by smaller porosity and shorter reaction time tang et al 2013 thus decreasing the nitrogen conversion capacity of the anammox reactor it is expected that there may be certain type of granules in the reactor with neither too large nor too low diameter which mainly drive the anammox process and they are expressed as a mathematical expectation value in this study compared with the apparent carmine color of the settling anammox granules the color of the floating granules was lighter figs 2a and 2b the saa of the settled granules 1 75 gn gvss d was nearly twice of the floating granules 0 75 gn gvss d as shown table 1 the possible reason is that the activity of anammox bacteria might be affected due to the long term insufficient substrate supply at the top of the uasb reactor moreover the density of floating sludge is lower than the settled one but the density after broken without cavitation is almost the same table 1 besides granule diameter bulk substrate concentration is also of importance for modelling as shown in fig 2c the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n at the bottom were 247 15 226 20 and 56 9 0 mg l whereas at the top of reactor the corresponding values were 30 3 6 4 5 0 4 and 67 2 0 mg l respectively these values were used as boundary conditions for subsequent simulation calculation 4 2 simulation of substrate diffusion and cavitation size in the floating and settled anammox granules in order to verify the hypothesis that substrate limitation would cause cell lysis and finally form cavitation inside the granules the inner section of floating and settled anammox granules were observed with transmission electron micrographs tem by cutting one granule from the middle fig 3 a the diversity of microbial communities was also analyzed by high throughput pyrosequencing fig 3b the number of cells with typical anammox like ultrastructure tang et al 2011 is much higher in the settled granule fig 3a a ⅲ than the floating one fig 3a a i more non anammox like ultrastructure cells appeared in the floating granules fig 3a a i furthermore the relative abundance of anammox bacteria kunuenia in the settled sludge is also higher than the floated granule fig 3b in particular the anammox bacterial cells in the floating sludge seemed to be autolyzing without complete cellular structure fig 3a a ⅱ as compared to the settled one fig 3a a ⅳ all these results confirmed the above mentioned hypothesis that the anammox bacteria on the edge of the cavity could be in endogenous respiration state finally leading to the formation of cavitation in the core of anammox granules eq 1b can be solved in combination with eq 10 by using the bvp5c built in function of matlab 2017b which can solve the ode with boundary value problems consequently the substrate distribution and the size of cavitation within granule could be determined the simulated critical substrate concentrations s crit for nh4 n and no2 n were calculated as 0 041 mg l and 0 031 mg l respectively suggesting that the s crit values for the two types of substrates were not significantly different thus any of the above s crit values can be used to compute the size of cavitation the mean diameter of settled granules was 2 46 0 23 mm the p crit and p sim indicating the volume percentages of the critical g crit and simulated cavitation g sim respectively were both 6 40 volume 0 188 mm3 and 0 respectively considering nh4 n and no2 n as the sole boundary substrate figs 4a and 4b the simulated results p sim 0 less than p crit 6 40 suggested the absence of cavitation and no floating occurrence in settled granules under the tested conditions the calculated results agreed with the real situation of settling regarding the mean diameter of floating granules of 3 06 0 17 mm the p crit and p sim were 6 65 volume 0 61 mm3 and 38 92 volume 3 56 mm3 respectively using nh4 n as boundary substrate fig 4c when no2 n was used as the boundary substrate the calculated p crit and p sim values were 6 65 volume 0 61 mm3 and 68 15 volume 6 23 mm3 respectively fig 4d other detailed parameters were listed in table s3 it was found that the g crit was considerably less than the g sim for floating granules indicating the granule flotation which was also in accordance with the observed floating phenomenon the high consistency of these results suggesting that the model and concept of this study was reasonable and reliable the p sim in the present study was lower than the value calculated using the empirical formula from lu et al 2012 for settled granules figs 4a and 4b but was significantly higher than the value 0 58 with diameter of 3 06 mm for the floating granules fig 4c d interestingly the settled and floating behaviors figs 4b and 4d assessed from our model inversely fall in the zone of flotation reported by campos et al 2017 with no2 n as the boundary substrate the main reason of the opposite result was that the lysis of microorganisms caused by insufficient substrate was not considered in the method of campos et al 2017 in addition the p sim figs 4a and 4b computed with nh4 n or no2 n as the boundary substrate did not show difference for settled granule both were 0 however for the floating granule there was a big difference 20 3 for nh4 n but 50 0 for no2 n figs 4c and 4d which was mainly ascribed to the large difference of their concentrations in the top zone of reactor fig 2c the simulations for cavitation size and volume percentage were carried out for the anammox granules with diameter ranging from 0 5 to 5 mm as shown in fig 5 in each subgraph of fig 5 some of the granules belonged to the settled or floating granules based on the concept of flotation in this model the average p sim in the settled one were 2 54 fig 5a and 2 46 fig 5b with nh4 n and no2 n as boundary substrate respectively the difference between both values was little but the corresponding values in the floating part was 40 89 nh4 n fig 5c and 61 52 no2 n fig 5d respectively more comparative information on the simulation is presented in table s4 the average p sim in the settled granule figs 5a and 5b was approximately twice of the corresponding values 1 06 and 1 13 calculated by lu et al 2012 based on the empirical formula however the p sim in floating granule figs 5c and 5d was significantly higher than the values 5 51 and 5 47 computed by lu et al 2012 generally the empirical model lu et al 2012 cannot identify whether the anammox granules float or not therefore the application of the empirical model might be limited in fact when g sim is larger than g crit the granules will float on the top of the reactor consequently the concentration on granule surface would be further reduced because the bulk concentration is much lower at the top fig 2c considering that situation the cavitation of floating granules figs 5a and 5b was further simulated using the low bulk substrate concentration as boundary condition of model fig s4 results showed that the average g sim of the floating granule 55 29 for nh4 n and 76 67 for no2 n respectively figs s3c and s3d was slightly larger than the corresponding value of 40 89 fig 5c and 61 52 fig 5d in summary the simulated results of the present integrated model are consistent with the respective actual observation using nh4 n or no2 n as single substrate limited only using one substrate as boundary value of model it implies that different boundary substrates did not cause change in the structure and concept of the model additionally the mass transfer coefficient of no2 n was slightly less than that of nh4 n in literature and the anammox stoichiometric ratio of nh4 n no2 n is reported as 1 1 32 picioreanu et al 1997 strous et al 1998 this two reasons contribute to a lower no2 n concentration at the inner of anammox granule therefore no2 n was the main limiting substrate for microbial growth compared to nh4 n which will be used as the key substrate for prediction and assessing of floating or settled behavior and cavitation size of anammox granules i e the application of the model in the subsequent sections 4 3 calibrations and predictions from the model 4 3 1 granule weight one of the most important deductions reached from the hypothesis is that the single anammox granule flotation was caused by decreased gravity f g after long term substrate starvation f g f b however its critical substrate concentration scrit i on edge of cavity is constant eq 10 gravity is directly correlated with the weight mass while the weight is related to the diameter of granule and cavitation eq 4 results showed that the developed model could well simulate the weight variation with increasing diameter for both settled and floating granules fig 6 nevertheless the correlation for floated granules r2 0 7613 figs 6a and 6b was slightly less than the settled one r2 0 8287 figs 6c and 6d one possible reason is that the granule interior cavity might be easily filled with some liquid thus causing increase of granule mass than the unfilled one in summary due to high match of modelling results with experiment values the integrated model was appropriate to quantitatively evaluate cavitation of anammox granules the simulation of f g and f b was performed on different modelled diameters and cavitation sizes as shown fig s5 it should be noted that the equilibrium point representing critical cavitation size of flotation would increase with the increase of granules diameter fig s5 4 3 2 settling and floating zone of anammox granules the relationship between diameter d p and cavitation size g sim and g crit is shown in fig 7 a under constant substrate concentration the g sim would gradually increase with the increase of diameter until exceeding the critical value g crit and resulting in granules flotation the green circle exceeds the yellow one as shown in fig 7a similarly under granular size unchanged the g sim would gradually decrease as the substrate concentration rise until being less than g crit the green circle inside the yellow one fig 7a which suggests that granule sludge is unlikely to float obviously we can find the granules have a strong floating tendency under larger granule diameter and smaller substrate concentration for example in the lower right corner of fig 7a lu et al 2013 also reported that the anammox granules over 4 mm had a strong floating potential since cell lysis may take place in the core of granule due to poor substrate transport additionally the simulated results fig 7a could further clarify that the larger anammox granules have larger cavitation chen et al 2010 lu et al 2012 the granular sludge flotation can be identified based on model simulation fig 7b under the same conditions as shown in fig 7a for granule size ranging from 0 5 to 2 5 mm the modelling results suggested that anammox granules flotation was not affected by the substrate concentration fig 7b which is defined as the no flotation zone no flotation occurrence consistently within 2 5 4 5 mm diameter defined as transition zone the flotation was depended on both the granule size and substrate concentration the first order sensitivity coefficients for substrate concentration and granule diameter to flotation were 0 53 and 1 31 respectively in the transition zone by employing the sensitivity analysis method tang et al 2013 the sensitivity analysis results show that granule size is the main contributing parameter for granule flotation over substrate concentration which supported the fact that most of researchers try to control granules size to mitigate granular sludge flotation chen et al 2010 wang et al 2014 the possible reason is that the decrease in the granule size could favor mass transfer to support cell growth in its core thus relieving the formation of cavity in diameter range of 4 5 5 5 mm defined as flotation zone fig 7b granule flotation would inevitably occur regardless of substrate concentration and granule size however the entire flotation zone fig 7 indicated by the developed model is incompletely overlapped with the results of campos et al 2017 the possible reason is that the bacterial lysis in flotation was not considered in their research in order to maintain high loading operation of the anammox uasb reactor sludge particle size and substrate concentration should be controlled in the no flotation zone and the suitable area in transition zone according to the model simulation results fig 7b the optimum granule size can be identified around 2 5 mm fig 7b with satisfied settling performance fig 8 which falls in the range of the reported values chen et al 2010 lu et al 2012 2013 in summary the comparative simulation results fig 7 could further demonstrate that the developed integrated model is reliable for evaluation of cavitation and granule flotation it is worth noting that large anammox granules could be obtained due to bacterial growth eventually resulting in inevitable granule flotation and instability of the reactor that is key reason why anammox granules frequently float in high loading conditions 4 3 3 modification of settling velocity of anammox granules the settling performance of anammox granular sludge is an important indicator of biomass retention in upflow reactors which ultimately determines the potential reaction capacity wang and zheng 2017 in this work the stokes equation has been modified based on evaluated cavitation the simulated results suggested that the settling velocity increases with the increase of granule diameter but further decreases along with diameter increase fig 8 the predicted trend is in accordance with the actual situation fig 8 showing that the modified settling model is reliable according to eq 19a or eq 19b the possible reason for the decrease in settling velocity at larger diameter could be caused by the decrease of granule density which is ascribed to the formation of cavitation and the reduction of mass shape factor ψ m a s s or shape correction factor φ due to the diameter increase this inflection point at diameter of 2 75 mm in fig 8 referred to the beginning of cavitation formation the trend of the settling velocity of anammox granules before formation of cavity is in accordance with the results reported by other works wang and zheng 2017 lu et al 2013 while reverses after cavity formation the most probable reason is that cavitation was not integrated into in their models additionally all of the reynold numbers r ep of anammox granules calculated by the model were larger than 2 falling into the allen district which were summarized in table s5 4 3 4 the prediction of growth and flotation for anammox granules in long term reactor operation the growth of anammox granule over time would lead to flotation because larger granule has higher potential to create cavity as confirmed above this dynamic process can be described by the model simulation based on eq 21 as shown in fig 9 the span of floated time decreases rapidly from approximate 110 d 20 d as the modelled diameter increase from 0 25 to 1 5 mm under constant boundary substrate concentration fig 9a which indicates that the granule size brings great impact on flotation in addition the growth rate of particle size slope of the curve also increases with diameter near linear relationship when diameter 1 mm showing that the large granule could accelerate bacterial autolysis at its core to form cavity due to extreme absence of substrate besides the span of floated time is prolonged from 38 d to 67 d with no2 n concentration increasing from 50 to 250 mgn l under constant diameter of 0 75 mm fig 9b which responses to sufficient substrate within inner of granule however the span of floated time 38 d 67 d fig 9b is much shorter than that of 20 110 d fig 9a further implying controlling granule size is more effective to avoid flotation than substrate concentration 5 implication of the developed model the mathematical model developed in this work including the concept of cavity formation shows good reliability and portability for quantitative calculation of cavitation size the simulation results were consistent with the real situation during the long term operation of anammox upflow reactor therefore the integrated model can provide operational guidance to control granule flotation in practical operation of reactor especially in understanding the intrinsic relationship between cavitation and granules flotation furthermore this model can be extrapolated to granule based reactors with floatation control the accuracy of the model is greatly dependent on the critical substrate concentration s crit however little information about this value is available in literature therefore the model still needs to be further calibration 6 conclusions a novel integrated mathematical model has been successfully developed to quantify the size of cavitation and flotation behavior of anammox granule based on the concept of lysis to create space in the core of granule the zone of flotation could be divided into three sections based on the model no flotation corresponding diameter range 2 5 mm transition zone 2 5 4 5 mm and flotation zone 4 5 mm especially in the transition zone the floating behavior of anammox granule could be affected by both the granular size and substrate concentrations the optimum granule diameter can be identified as around 2 5 mm in present study in order to avoid flotation and obtain high settling performance substrate concentration and granule diameter should be maintained at the no flotation zone and the suitable area in transition zone during the reactor operation the velocity formula modified by the model could well describe the settling tendency of the anammox granules the flotation potential increases with the increase of cavitation size inside

18056,the granulation of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox biomass plays a key role in high rate performance of upflow type anammox reactors however the formation of cavitation inside granules may result in sludge flotation problem which negatively affects the operation stability for quantitative evaluation of the anammox granules flotation in upflow reactors an integrated mathematical model was formulated based on the principles that the limitation of substrate diffusion would result in bacterial starvation lysis and subsequently aiding the formation of cavitation in the inner zone of granules the proposed model is used to investigate the possible mechanism of cavitation formation and granules flotation the combined modelling and experimental results showed that the model predictions matched well with the actual floating behavior of granules r 2 0 83 for settled sludge and 0 76 for floating sludge based on the model results the granule flotation could be divided into three zones namely i no flotation zone no flotation occurrence ii transition zone flotation with a part of granules and iii flotation zone inevitable flotation occurrence the floating behavior of granules was mainly influenced by granule diameter 2 5 4 5 mm and substrate concentration no2 n 50 250 mg l in the transition zone the optimum granule diameter to avoid flotation but with excellent settling performance was identified around 2 5 mm additionally the granule size is more sensitivity to flotation than substrate concentration hence controlling the size of granules is more important

inside granules tang et al 2011 winkler et al 2018 kang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 consequently enhancing efficiency of anammox and protecting against changing environmental conditions ni et al 2014 hou et al 2015 lin and wang 2017 xu et al 2019 unfortunately flotation of anammox granular sludge would occur spontaneously at high nitrogen loading rates nlr especially in upflow granular sludge bioreactors tang et al 2009 2017 chen et al 2010 2014 lu et al 2015 song et al 2017 the flotation subsequently leads to the biomass washout and even results in the failure of nitrogen removal performance of anammox bioreactors tang et al 2009 campos et al 2017 song et al 2017 wang et al 2018b chen et al 2019 cavitation in the inner of anammox granules has been reported to be the key reason for granule flotation chen et al 2010 lu et al 2012 campos et al 2017 manonmani and joseph 2018 however these researches were mainly based on operational observations and experimental measurements which can neither calculate the volume of cavitation nor assess the granule flotation actually the cavitation is hard to be determined experimentally mathematical modelling is a powerful tool to understand the complex processes that cannot be directly observed through experiments ni and yu 2010 su et al 2013 baeten et al 2019 although some equations concerning anammox flotation were proposed most of them were empirical for example lu et al 2012 obtained an experience equation between cavitation volume and diameter by cubic fitting campos et al 2017 explained the flotation of granular biomass based on kinetic stoichiometry results which seems not to better explain the cases with large sized granules at low substrate concentration generally the limitation of substrate diffusion in granules was not included in these flotation studies the cavity formation and its correlation to flotation cannot been integrated into these models either the force analysis of buoyancy v s settling is directly related with the sludge flotation issue the granules in water receive upward forces mainly the buoyancy f b and downward forces mainly the gravity f g tang et al 2009 the formation of cavity inside granule leads to decrease in f g or average density thus when the volume of cavity increases to a certain value resulting in f g f b granule will float on water surface for large diameter granules there is a penetration limit inside granule named as critical penetration length lc as shown in fig s1 when the radius r is larger than lc i e r lc microorganisms within zones of r lc would be gradually autolyzed which consequently results in formation of cavity inside the granules wang et al 2017 2019 such situation would lead to reduced f g or density of granule which ultimately trigger granule flotation meanwhile within zones of penetration limit lc a part of dinitrogen gas produced by anammox bacteria might be released into exterior of granule through gas tunnel the other part is trapped in the cavity due to some gas tunnels blocked by extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by bacteria chen et al 2010 wang et al 2018a to our knowledge few studies have been reported to interpret the above elucidated mechanism and then construct a mathematical model quantitatively evaluating the sludge flotation behavior in this study a novel integrated mathematical model was developed based on the above elucidated flotation mechanism the main aim was to estimate the cavitation size of anammox granule at different operating conditions and granule diameters as well as to reveal the relationship between the cavitation and behavior of granules flotation the guidelines for the operation of upflow granular sludge bioreactor in order to avoid granule flotation are discussed as well 2 materials and methods 2 1 anammox reactor and synthetic wastewater the anammox granular sludge were taken from the bottom and top zones in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor which had been successfully operated for 3 years in laboratory with nitrogen loading rate nlr higher than 5 kg m3 d the plexiglas made uasb 5 cm inner diameter had a total volume of 1 2 l and working volume of 1 0 l the synthetic wastewater composition used in the study is presented in table s2 tang et al 2011 during the two months of sampling period the reactor was stably operated with influent nh4 n of 247 15 mg l no2 n of 226 20 mg l respectively the effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were 30 3 6 4 5 0 4 and 67 2 0 mg l with nh4 n and no2 n removal efficiencies of 91 and 99 respectively the stoichiometric ratio of ammonium conversion to nitrite removal was 1 1 02 0 04 indicating the steady state and typical anammox reaction 2 2 analytical methods the concentration of three n species including ammonium nh4 n nitrite no2 n and nitrate no3 n were measured according to standard methods apha 2017 the diameter of the anammox granules was determined by matlab 2017b image processing as shown in supplementary fig s2 anammox granular sludge images were taken by digital camera lympus pen lite e pl5 17 mm f1 8 china the density and settling velocity of anammox granules were measured following the protocol described by lu et al 2012 specific anammox activity saa was determined according to the procedures given by yu et al 2019 diversity of microbial communities was analyzed by high throughput pyrosequencing song et al 2017 feng et al 2020 and transmission electron microscopy tem was performed according to the protocol described in previous studies tang et al 2019 3 model development 3 1 general assumptions the model described here has the following basic assumptions first the anammox granules are considered in spheres as frequently reported ni et al 2009 tang et al 2011 campos et al 2017 and the generated cavitations are also spherical correspondingly second the distributions of density and biomass in the non cavity zone are considered to be uniform and constant which is usually used in granular sludge modelling ni et al 2009 tang et al 2013 the substrate radial diffusion in granules could be described by fick s law ni et al 2009 the fluid dynamics influence on flotation chen et al 2014 wang et al 2017 has been integrated into the substrate nh4 n or no2 n diffusion coefficients which were taken from ni et al 2009 where the anammox operation dynamics were similar to the present study mass transfer resistance from the bulk liquid to the granule surface could be negligible as reported li and liu 2005 and therefore the substrate concentration on the granule surface is equal to that of presenting in the bulk liquid anammox reaction dominates in the granules in high loaded anammox reactors so the other bioprocesses were neglected in this model the procedures of the modelling consist of 6 steps fig 1 step 1 determine critical substrate concentration and diameter of granule step 2 calculate substrate micro profile inside granule step 3 calculate critical cavity size step 4 calculate simulated cavity size step 5 assess flotation and step 6 calibrate and predict 3 2 reaction diffusion equations at steady state the distribution of the substrates ammonium and nitrite inside the granules can be calculated using reaction diffusion equation benefield and molz 1983 li and liu 2005 perez et al 2005 ni et al 2009 the equations that expressed as coupled second order nonlinear ordinary differential equations ode are described below 1a d n h 4 n d 2 s r n h 4 n d r 2 2 r d s r n h 4 n d r υ r 0 d n o 2 n d 2 s r

concentration in the bulk liquid for component of i nh4 n or no2 n k i is half saturation constant for component i k is the proportionality constant ρ x is realistic density of a granule with cavitation d i is the effective diffusivity of i y is yield coefficients for anammox growth the values of parameters were summarized in table s1 to reduce the complexity of the model calculation eq 1a was simplified as a second order nonlinear ode with a single substrate limited which describes single substrate transfer and consumption inside the granule thus eq 1a can be rewritten as follows 1b d

r 0 at r r s i s b u l k i the distributions of different component of i inside the anammox granular sludge have been described in the next section 3 3 modelling of cavitation size inside granule 3 3 1 critical cavitation size gravity the gravity of granule containing cavitation could be defined by eq 4 4 f g m g π 6 ρ b d j 3 d j r 3 g where f g is gravity of granule d j is equivalent granule diameter containing cavitation mm d j r is equivalent cavitation diameter mm ρ b is density of granule without cavitation and the g is the gravitational constant 9 8 m s2 buoyancy under the steady state the buoyancy of the granule from liquid phase was only related to the granule s volume it is expressed as follows 5 f b ρ w π 6 d j 3 g where f b is buoyancy of granule ρ w is density of the related fluid the fluid refers to water in this work when cavitation size inside the granule increased to a critical value that could result in a lower gravity f g than buoyancy f b i e f g f b the granule started to float otherwise the granular sludge would settle down eqs 6 and 7 could be deduced to calculate the critical cavitation size d j o 6 f g f b substituting eqs 4 5 into eq 6 gave 7 d j o d j ρ b ρ w ρ b 3 during the calculation of granular gravity the gravity of nitrogen gas trapped into the granule was considered negligible here d j o represents critical cavitation size causing flotation the different diameter symbols are illustrated in fig s1 3 3 2 simulated cavitation size it is hypothesized that the limitation of substrate penetration might cause the starvation of bacterial communities living at the core of the granule the long term starvation may lead to cellular lysis a cavity holding gas is developed inside the granule thus it is speculated that the microorganisms on the edge of the cavity may be in endogenous respiration state the situation can be expressed as follows 8 μ r k d here k d is the decay rate coefficient of anammox bacteria substituting eq 3b with eq 8 gives 9 μ r μ max s r i k i s r i k d then the critical substrate concentration scrit i forming cavitation is 10 s c r i t i k i k d μ i k d here scrit i refers to the critical substrate concentration for component i this value is only related to the kinetic characteristics of anammox bacteria the simulated cavitation diameter d j r of the granular sludge would be determined by combining equations eq 1b with eq 10 additionally the d j r varied at different granular diameters and bulk substrate concentrations thereby when d j r d j o or scrit i beyond s j o corresponding substrate concentration of d j o the granule would float and otherwise not 3 4 modification of settling velocity based on simulated cavitation size 1 granule density according to granular sludge mass balance eq 11 can be obtained as follows 11 ρ s π 6 d j 3 ρ b π 6 d j 3 d j r 3 after simplifying it can be rewritten as eq 12 12 ρ s ρ b d j 3 d j r 3 d j 3 here ρ s is the real granule density with cavitation as described above the real density of granule is closely related to the cavitation size that depends on granule diameter and bulk substrate concentration 2 settling velocity the mass shape factor ψ m a s s and shape correction factor φ are introduced to conveniently describe different characteristic diameters of the granular sludge bouwman et al 2004 lu et al 2013 thus eq 13 can be expressed as follows 13 d m ψ m d p d a φ d p where d m and d a are the mass diameter and the actual diameter of granular sludge respectively d p is the projected area equivalent sphere diameter here d j d m ψ m d p therefore eq 12 can be rewritten 14 ρ s ρ b ψ m 3 d p 3 d j r 3 ψ m 3 d p 3 the force balance of a granule containing cavitation in a constant velocity free settling process can be rewritten as follows lu et al 2013 15 π 6 d m 3 ρ s g π 6 d m 3 ρ w g c d π d p 3 4 ρ w u 2 2 substituting eq 13 into eq 15 it can be obtained as follows 16 u 4 g ρ s ρ w d p ψ m 3 3 c d ρ w the reynold number re p of a spherical granule in a free settling process can be calculated by eq 17 generally the reynold numbers of anammox granules were between 0 2 and 500 lu et al 2013 17 r e p u d a ρ w δ here δ is dynamic viscosity coefficient of water in case of r e p 2 the movement of granules occur in a layered zone thus the relationship between c d drag coefficient of granule and reynold number can be described as follows perry and green 2007 18 c d 24 r e p then the settling velocity u of granular sludge can be obtained 19a u ρ s ρ w ψ m 3 φ g 18 μ d p 2 in case of 2 r e p 10 3 the movement of granule falls into turbulent transition zone allen district thus the relationship between c d and reynold numbers can be described as follows perry and green 2007 20 c d 18 5 re p 0 6 then the settling velocity of granular sludge can be expressed as 19b u 1 4 4 g ρ s ρ w ψ m 3 φ 0 6 d p 1 6 3 18 5 μ 0 6 ρ w 0 4 the settling velocity of a granule can be calculated by various formulae eq 19a or eq 19b based on the hit and trial method the calculation is accomplished by using the matlab 2017b during the subsequent modelling the projected area equivalent sphere diameter d p was considered as an apparent indicator for the final results because it is easier to understand and can be determined in reactor operation the interim parameter of d j or mass diameter d m were taken as calculating diameters 3 5 the simulation of granular growth and flotation the microorganism growth within granular sludge leads to increase in granule diameter apparently ni and yu 2010 su et al 2013 based on mass balance it is supposed that the biomass of net growth in the non cavity zone is the same as the increased part of diameter containing one thereby eq 21 can be deduced as follows at t to t dt and r to dr δ biomass n o n c a v i t y biomass δ r then 21 r j r j 1 r j 1 r r j 1 μ r k d r 2 d r r j 1 2 δ t m m 2 3 n the r j r refers to cavitation radius corresponding to granular diameter of d j mm eq 21 can be solved by numerical integration on matlab 2017b 4 results and discussion 4 1 experimental analysis of the granule diameter and substrate concentration distribution in the reactor the settled and floating anammox granules were collected from the bottom and top of the lab scale uasb reactor respectively as shown in figs 2 a and 2b the diameter distribution of these collected granules was determined as shown in fig s3 the distribution of the granule diameter obeys the normal distribution as indicated by the distribution hypothesis test employing the lillietest built in function of matlab 2017b the mathematical expectation of the normal probability distribution curve fig s3 implied that the respective average diameters were 2 46 and 3 06 mm for the settled and floating anammox granules in the top and bottom zones of the reactor respectively as anticipated anammox granules with smaller size present in the bottom of the reactor can effectively occupy most of the space which enhances the contact probability with substrates resulting in strong mass transfer ability wang et al 2018a nonetheless too small size granules may increase packing density of granules accompanying by smaller porosity and shorter reaction time tang et al 2013 thus decreasing the nitrogen conversion capacity of the anammox reactor it is expected that there may be certain type of granules in the reactor with neither too large nor too low diameter which mainly drive the anammox process and they are expressed as a mathematical expectation value in this study compared with the apparent carmine color of the settling anammox granules the color of the floating granules was lighter figs 2a and 2b the saa of the settled granules 1 75 gn gvss d was nearly twice of the floating granules 0 75 gn gvss d as shown table 1 the possible reason is that the activity of anammox bacteria might be affected due to the long term insufficient substrate supply at the top of the uasb reactor moreover the density of floating sludge is lower than the settled one but the density after broken without cavitation is almost the same table 1 besides granule diameter bulk substrate concentration is also of importance for modelling as shown in fig 2c the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n at the bottom were 247 15 226 20 and 56 9 0 mg l whereas at the top of reactor the corresponding values were 30 3 6 4 5 0 4 and 67 2 0 mg l respectively these values were used as boundary conditions for subsequent simulation calculation 4 2 simulation of substrate diffusion and cavitation size in the floating and settled anammox granules in order to verify the hypothesis that substrate limitation would cause cell lysis and finally form cavitation inside the granules the inner section of floating and settled anammox granules were observed with transmission electron micrographs tem by cutting one granule from the middle fig 3 a the diversity of microbial communities was also analyzed by high throughput pyrosequencing fig 3b the number of cells with typical anammox like ultrastructure tang et al 2011 is much higher in the settled granule fig 3a a ⅲ than the floating one fig 3a a i more non anammox like ultrastructure cells appeared in the floating granules fig 3a a i furthermore the relative abundance of anammox bacteria kunuenia in the settled sludge is also higher than the floated granule fig 3b in particular the anammox bacterial cells in the floating sludge seemed to be autolyzing without complete cellular structure fig 3a a ⅱ as compared to the settled one fig 3a a ⅳ all these results confirmed the above mentioned hypothesis that the anammox bacteria on the edge of the cavity could be in endogenous respiration state finally leading to the formation of cavitation in the core of anammox granules eq 1b can be solved in combination with eq 10 by using the bvp5c built in function of matlab 2017b which can solve the ode with boundary value problems consequently the substrate distribution and the size of cavitation within granule could be determined the simulated critical substrate concentrations s crit for nh4 n and no2 n were calculated as 0 041 mg l and 0 031 mg l respectively suggesting that the s crit values for the two types of substrates were not significantly different thus any of the above s crit values can be used to compute the size of cavitation the mean diameter of settled granules was 2 46 0 23 mm the p crit and p sim indicating the volume percentages of the critical g crit and simulated cavitation g sim respectively were both 6 40 volume 0 188 mm3 and 0 respectively considering nh4 n and no2 n as the sole boundary substrate figs 4a and 4b the simulated results p sim 0 less than p crit 6 40 suggested the absence of cavitation and no floating occurrence in settled granules under the tested conditions the calculated results agreed with the real situation of settling regarding the mean diameter of floating granules of 3 06 0 17 mm the p crit and p sim were 6 65 volume 0 61 mm3 and 38 92 volume 3 56 mm3 respectively using nh4 n as boundary substrate fig 4c when no2 n was used as the boundary substrate the calculated p crit and p sim values were 6 65 volume 0 61 mm3 and 68 15 volume 6 23 mm3 respectively fig 4d other detailed parameters were listed in table s3 it was found that the g crit was considerably less than the g sim for floating granules indicating the granule flotation which was also in accordance with the observed floating phenomenon the high consistency of these results suggesting that the model and concept of this study was reasonable and reliable the p sim in the present study was lower than the value calculated using the empirical formula from lu et al 2012 for settled granules figs 4a and 4b but was significantly higher than the value 0 58 with diameter of 3 06 mm for the floating granules fig 4c d interestingly the settled and floating behaviors figs 4b and 4d assessed from our model inversely fall in the zone of flotation reported by campos et al 2017 with no2 n as the boundary substrate the main reason of the opposite result was that the lysis of microorganisms caused by insufficient substrate was not considered in the method of campos et al 2017 in addition the p sim figs 4a and 4b computed with nh4 n or no2 n as the boundary substrate did not show difference for settled granule both were 0 however for the floating granule there was a big difference 20 3 for nh4 n but 50 0 for no2 n figs 4c and 4d which was mainly ascribed to the large difference of their concentrations in the top zone of reactor fig 2c the simulations for cavitation size and volume percentage were carried out for the anammox granules with diameter ranging from 0 5 to 5 mm as shown in fig 5 in each subgraph of fig 5 some of the granules belonged to the settled or floating granules based on the concept of flotation in this model the average p sim in the settled one were 2 54 fig 5a and 2 46 fig 5b with nh4 n and no2 n as boundary substrate respectively the difference between both values was little but the corresponding values in the floating part was 40 89 nh4 n fig 5c and 61 52 no2 n fig 5d respectively more comparative information on the simulation is presented in table s4 the average p sim in the settled granule figs 5a and 5b was approximately twice of the corresponding values 1 06 and 1 13 calculated by lu et al 2012 based on the empirical formula however the p sim in floating granule figs 5c and 5d was significantly higher than the values 5 51 and 5 47 computed by lu et al 2012 generally the empirical model lu et al 2012 cannot identify whether the anammox granules float or not therefore the application of the empirical model might be limited in fact when g sim is larger than g crit the granules will float on the top of the reactor consequently the concentration on granule surface would be further reduced because the bulk concentration is much lower at the top fig 2c considering that situation the cavitation of floating granules figs 5a and 5b was further simulated using the low bulk substrate concentration as boundary condition of model fig s4 results showed that the average g sim of the floating granule 55 29 for nh4 n and 76 67 for no2 n respectively figs s3c and s3d was slightly larger than the corresponding value of 40 89 fig 5c and 61 52 fig 5d in summary the simulated results of the present integrated model are consistent with the respective actual observation using nh4 n or no2 n as single substrate limited only using one substrate as boundary value of model it implies that different boundary substrates did not cause change in the structure and concept of the model additionally the mass transfer coefficient of no2 n was slightly less than that of nh4 n in literature and the anammox stoichiometric ratio of nh4 n no2 n is reported as 1 1 32 picioreanu et al 1997 strous et al 1998 this two reasons contribute to a lower no2 n concentration at the inner of anammox granule therefore no2 n was the main limiting substrate for microbial growth compared to nh4 n which will be used as the key substrate for prediction and assessing of floating or settled behavior and cavitation size of anammox granules i e the application of the model in the subsequent sections 4 3 calibrations and predictions from the model 4 3 1 granule weight one of the most important deductions reached from the hypothesis is that the single anammox granule flotation was caused by decreased gravity f g after long term substrate starvation f g f b however its critical substrate concentration scrit i on edge of cavity is constant eq 10 gravity is directly correlated with the weight mass while the weight is related to the diameter of granule and cavitation eq 4 results showed that the developed model could well simulate the weight variation with increasing diameter for both settled and floating granules fig 6 nevertheless the correlation for floated granules r2 0 7613 figs 6a and 6b was slightly less than the settled one r2 0 8287 figs 6c and 6d one possible reason is that the granule interior cavity might be easily filled with some liquid thus causing increase of granule mass than the unfilled one in summary due to high match of modelling results with experiment values the integrated model was appropriate to quantitatively evaluate cavitation of anammox granules the simulation of f g and f b was performed on different modelled diameters and cavitation sizes as shown fig s5 it should be noted that the equilibrium point representing critical cavitation size of flotation would increase with the increase of granules diameter fig s5 4 3 2 settling and floating zone of anammox granules the relationship between diameter d p and cavitation size g sim and g crit is shown in fig 7 a under constant substrate concentration the g sim would gradually increase with the increase of diameter until exceeding the critical value g crit and resulting in granules flotation the green circle exceeds the yellow one as shown in fig 7a similarly under granular size unchanged the g sim would gradually decrease as the substrate concentration rise until being less than g crit the green circle inside the yellow one fig 7a which suggests that granule sludge is unlikely to float obviously we can find the granules have a strong floating tendency under larger granule diameter and smaller substrate concentration for example in the lower right corner of fig 7a lu et al 2013 also reported that the anammox granules over 4 mm had a strong floating potential since cell lysis may take place in the core of granule due to poor substrate transport additionally the simulated results fig 7a could further clarify that the larger anammox granules have larger cavitation chen et al 2010 lu et al 2012 the granular sludge flotation can be identified based on model simulation fig 7b under the same conditions as shown in fig 7a for granule size ranging from 0 5 to 2 5 mm the modelling results suggested that anammox granules flotation was not affected by the substrate concentration fig 7b which is defined as the no flotation zone no flotation occurrence consistently within 2 5 4 5 mm diameter defined as transition zone the flotation was depended on both the granule size and substrate concentration the first order sensitivity coefficients for substrate concentration and granule diameter to flotation were 0 53 and 1 31 respectively in the transition zone by employing the sensitivity analysis method tang et al 2013 the sensitivity analysis results show that granule size is the main contributing parameter for granule flotation over substrate concentration which supported the fact that most of researchers try to control granules size to mitigate granular sludge flotation chen et al 2010 wang et al 2014 the possible reason is that the decrease in the granule size could favor mass transfer to support cell growth in its core thus relieving the formation of cavity in diameter range of 4 5 5 5 mm defined as flotation zone fig 7b granule flotation would inevitably occur regardless of substrate concentration and granule size however the entire flotation zone fig 7 indicated by the developed model is incompletely overlapped with the results of campos et al 2017 the possible reason is that the bacterial lysis in flotation was not considered in their research in order to maintain high loading operation of the anammox uasb reactor sludge particle size and substrate concentration should be controlled in the no flotation zone and the suitable area in transition zone according to the model simulation results fig 7b the optimum granule size can be identified around 2 5 mm fig 7b with satisfied settling performance fig 8 which falls in the range of the reported values chen et al 2010 lu et al 2012 2013 in summary the comparative simulation results fig 7 could further demonstrate that the developed integrated model is reliable for evaluation of cavitation and granule flotation it is worth noting that large anammox granules could be obtained due to bacterial growth eventually resulting in inevitable granule flotation and instability of the reactor that is key reason why anammox granules frequently float in high loading conditions 4 3 3 modification of settling velocity of anammox granules the settling performance of anammox granular sludge is an important indicator of biomass retention in upflow reactors which ultimately determines the potential reaction capacity wang and zheng 2017 in this work the stokes equation has been modified based on evaluated cavitation the simulated results suggested that the settling velocity increases with the increase of granule diameter but further decreases along with diameter increase fig 8 the predicted trend is in accordance with the actual situation fig 8 showing that the modified settling model is reliable according to eq 19a or eq 19b the possible reason for the decrease in settling velocity at larger diameter could be caused by the decrease of granule density which is ascribed to the formation of cavitation and the reduction of mass shape factor ψ m a s s or shape correction factor φ due to the diameter increase this inflection point at diameter of 2 75 mm in fig 8 referred to the beginning of cavitation formation the trend of the settling velocity of anammox granules before formation of cavity is in accordance with the results reported by other works wang and zheng 2017 lu et al 2013 while reverses after cavity formation the most probable reason is that cavitation was not integrated into in their models additionally all of the reynold numbers r ep of anammox granules calculated by the model were larger than 2 falling into the allen district which were summarized in table s5 4 3 4 the prediction of growth and flotation for anammox granules in long term reactor operation the growth of anammox granule over time would lead to flotation because larger granule has higher potential to create cavity as confirmed above this dynamic process can be described by the model simulation based on eq 21 as shown in fig 9 the span of floated time decreases rapidly from approximate 110 d 20 d as the modelled diameter increase from 0 25 to 1 5 mm under constant boundary substrate concentration fig 9a which indicates that the granule size brings great impact on flotation in addition the growth rate of particle size slope of the curve also increases with diameter near linear relationship when diameter 1 mm showing that the large granule could accelerate bacterial autolysis at its core to form cavity due to extreme absence of substrate besides the span of floated time is prolonged from 38 d to 67 d with no2 n concentration increasing from 50 to 250 mgn l under constant diameter of 0 75 mm fig 9b which responses to sufficient substrate within inner of granule however the span of floated time 38 d 67 d fig 9b is much shorter than that of 20 110 d fig 9a further implying controlling granule size is more effective to avoid flotation than substrate concentration 5 implication of the developed model the mathematical model developed in this work including the concept of cavity formation shows good reliability and portability for quantitative calculation of cavitation size the simulation results were consistent with the real situation during the long term operation of anammox upflow reactor therefore the integrated model can provide operational guidance to control granule flotation in practical operation of reactor especially in understanding the intrinsic relationship between cavitation and granules flotation furthermore this model can be extrapolated to granule based reactors with floatation control the accuracy of the model is greatly dependent on the critical substrate concentration s crit however little information about this value is available in literature therefore the model still needs to be further calibration 6 conclusions a novel integrated mathematical model has been successfully developed to quantify the size of cavitation and flotation behavior of anammox granule based on the concept of lysis to create space in the core of granule the zone of flotation could be divided into three sections based on the model no flotation corresponding diameter range 2 5 mm transition zone 2 5 4 5 mm and flotation zone 4 5 mm especially in the transition zone the floating behavior of anammox granule could be affected by both the granular size and substrate concentrations the optimum granule diameter can be identified as around 2 5 mm in present study in order to avoid flotation and obtain high settling performance substrate concentration and granule diameter should be maintained at the no flotation zone and the suitable area in transition zone during the reactor operation the velocity formula modified by the model could well describe the settling tendency of the anammox granules the flotation potential increases with the increase of cavitation size inside

18057,iron based coagulants are dosed in enormous amounts and play an essential role in various segments of our urban water infrastructure in order for the water industry to become circular a closed loop management strategy for iron needs to be developed in this study we have demonstrated for the first time that in sewer dosed iron either in the form of fecl3 or ferric based drinking water sludge fe dws as a means to combat sewer corrosion and odour can be recovered in the form of vivianite in digested sludge in down stream wastewater treatment plants importantly about 92 2 of the in sewer dosed fe was estimated to be bound in vivianite in digested sludge a simple insertion of neodymium magnet allowed to recover 11 0 2 and 15 3 0 08 of the vivianite formed in the digested sludge of the in sewer dosed iron in the form of fecl3 and fe dws respectively the purity of recovered vivianite ranged between 70 5 and 49 3 for in sewer dosed fecl3 and fe dws respectively almost complete i e 98 0 3 separation of fe in the form of ferrihydrite was achieved from vivianite after alkaline washing subsequent batch experiments demonstrated that the recovered ferrihydrite can be directly reused for efficient sulfide control in sewers at a ferrihydrite fe s molar ratio of 1 2 1 sewage dissolved sulfide concentrations was reduced from 15 mgs l to below 0 5 mgs l within 1 h of reaction overall the results obtained in our study flag a first step for utilities towards a closed loop iron based coagulant management approach keywords resource efficiency sulfide control coagulant recovery integrated management circular economy 1 introduction iron salts are dosed in enormous amounts and play a key role in wastewater treatment apgar et al 2007 bratby 2016 dewolfe et al 2003 pikaar et al 2014 they are the most commonly used sulfide control chemicals to combat concrete corrosion and odour problems in sewer networks apgar et al 2007 ganigue et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 moreover the addition of iron salts is a prevalent approach for removing phosphate carliell marquet cooper 2014 de bashan et al 2004 korving et al 2019 and for controlling sulfide during anaerobic digestion in downstream wastewater treatment plants wwtps akgul et al 2017 charles et al 2006 we recently demonstrated that by adopting a catchment wide iron salts dosing strategy the overall iron consumption can be reduced while increasing the overall treatment performance in terms of sulfide control and phosphate removal rebosura et al 2018 salehin et al 2019 through both comprehensive laboratory scale testing and long term field studies it was found that ferrous or ferric chloride dosed to sewer networks to control hydrogen sulfide emissions is reused multiple times in downstream wastewater treatment plants for the removal of phosphate as well as hydrogen sulfide control during anaerobic digestion rebosura et al 2018 salehin et al 2019 the latter can be considered as a major step forward for the water industry as significant benefits can be achieved in terms of treatment performance for the overall urban water infrastructure by simply replacing the chemical dosing location to the upstream sewer network salehin et al 2019 iron salts are also often used as coagulant during drinking water production for the removal of natural organic matter turbidity colour and pathogens matilainen et al 2010 okour et al 2009 management of iron rich drinking water sludge often incurs substantial operational expenditure frias et al 2013 keeley et al 2016 due to the fact that iron based drinking water sludge is relatively low in organics and high in iron content babatunde zhao 2007 it has the potential to be beneficially reused for sulfide control in sewer networks as well as in the down stream wwtp for phosphate removal and sulfide control during anaerobic digestion similar to that of conventional iron salt dosing indeed recent studies demonstrated that ferric chloride based drinking water sludge can effectively control sulfide in sewers rebosura et al 2020 sun et al 2015 and effectively reused in downstream wwtps for phosphate removal and sulfide control during anaerobic digestion rebosura et al 2020 while these above described studies clearly demonstrated the practical feasibility of multiple iron reuse the iron species and potential changes in its speciation in the sewer network activated sludge tank and anaerobic digester has not been investigated in detail yet iron chemistry is complex and can undergo rapid transformations between ferrous fe ii ferric fe iii and mixed forms in wastewater due to variations in prevalent redox potentials moreover microbial induced oxidation reduction processes in aerobic and anaerobic zones can also occur nielsen et al 2005 wilfert et al 2015 as iron speciation may affect the reaction stoichiometry and kinetics it is important to determine the speciation and fate of sewer dosed iron in the downstream wwtp equally important such information is also essential to identify opportunities to recover iron from the sludge at the downstream wwtps after multiple usage recently various studies reported on the formation of vivianite i e an iron phosphate mineral fe ii 3 po4 2 8h2o at wwtps where iron salts either ferrous or ferric are dosed for phosphate removal wilfert et al 2016 2018 more recently laboratory scale experiments showed that vivianite formed in digested sludge can be recovered using a magnetic separator prot et al 2019 while it was found that further research is needed to improve the vivianite recovery efficiency this finding is important as it clearly highlighted the potential for selective recovery of iron from digested sludge to the authors best knowledge the fate of in sewer dosed iron either in the form of iron salts or iron rich drinking water sludge in the downstream wastewater treatment plants has not been investigated in detail yet therefore this study aimed to investigate the iron speciation and vivianite formation potential of in sewer dosed iron either in the form of ferric chloride and iron rich drinking water sludge through comprehensive long term testing using continuous flow laboratory scale systems used to simulate an urban wastewater system over a period of 31 months combined semi quantitative in depth xrd and sem eds analyses were used to investigate iron speciation and to quantify the amount of vivianite formed in waste activated sludge and digested sludge we also evaluated the practical feasibility of an interesting alternative valorisation route not focusing on the recovery of p but on the recovery and direct reuse of separated fe in the form of ferrihydrite as an effective sulfide control method in sewer networks 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory scale urban wastewater system two previously reported laboratory scale systems were used in this study one of which was used as the experimental line and the other as the control line each line compromised two sewer reactors a sequence batch reactor sbr for biological cod chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen removal a sludge thickener and an anaerobic sludge digester for biogas production the sewer reactors were fed with 10 l of raw sewage per day divided into four pumping events of 2 5 l every 6 h with a working volume of 8 5 l the sbr was maintained with a cycle time of 6 h 2 h of anoxic mixing 3 h of aerobic mixing 45 min of settling and 15 min of decanting 2 5 l of wastewater was fed to the sbr in the first 8 min of the anoxic phase the sbr was operated at a sludge retention time of 16 days the sludge thickener with a volume of 3 l was intermittently stirred at 2 rpm to produce the thickened sludge the anaerobic sludge digesters had a working volume of 1 l and a headspace of 300 ml the digesters were fed with 50 ml of thickened sludge per day resulting in a hrt of 20 days 50 ml of digested sludge was taken out from the reactor at the same time the domestic wastewater in the experiments was collected from a residential area in brisbane as described in detail elsewhere rebosura et al 2018 2020 2 2 reactor operation and sampling protocol the experiments were conducted over a period of 31 months and divided into four phases 1 baseline phase months 0 13 2 experimental phase i with in sewer ferric chloride dosing months 14 18 to the experimental line 3 recovery phase without any chemical dosing months 19 26 and 4 experimental phase ii with in sewer dosing of ferric based drinking water sludge referred to as dws here onwards months 27 31 to the new experimental line the control line in phase i during the baseline phase the two systems were operated identically without any chemical dosing until comparable performance was obtained in terms of biological nutrient and cod removal performance i e pseudo steady state in total this baseline period lasted for 13 months in experimental phase i ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o was added to the sewer reactor of the experimental line for a duration of 5 months throughout the duration of 5 months the dosing rate was maintained constant at a dosing rate of 10 mg fe3 l rebosura et al 2018 in the recovery phase which lasted for 8 months ferric chloride dosing was stopped and the two lines were operated identically for the two lines to achieve similar performance in the experimental phase ii dws was added to the sewer reactor of the new experimental line the previous control line for another 5 months the iron rich drinking water sludge used in this study originated from the cascade drinking water treatment plant operated by sydney water in new south wales australia a more detailed characterization of the dws can be found in the supplementary information table s1 the dws was dosed to the sewer reactor in the form of a slurry in order to obtain iron concentrations of 10 mg fe3 l similar to the experimental phase i thickened waste activated sludge 15 20 ml and digested sludge 50 ml samples were collected from both the control and experimental lines at the end of months 1 3 and 5 in both experimental phases as well as in the recovery phase the samples were collected in sterile screw cap containers flushed with nitrogen and immediately stored in a freezer at 18 c afterwards the samples were freeze dried and ground to powder form in anaerobic conditions for subsequent xrd combined with semi quantitative sem eds and icp oes analyses for detailed characterization and elemental composition see section 2 5 and 2 6 2 3 magnetic separation of vivianite and iron recovery via alkaline washing the sludge samples of the anaerobic digester at the end of both experimental phases were subjected to a two step approach as a means to selectively recover and reuse the iron from the digested sludge n 6 in the first step vivianite as discovered by the xrd combined with semi quantitative and sem eds analyses was separated from the sludge via the magnetic separation experiments for this purpose neodymium magnets 36 mm diameter and 8 mm thickness with a pull force of 48 kg were submerged into 200 ml of digested sludge liquor the solution was gently mixed using an overhead stirrer at a rate of 15 rpm in each magnetic separation experiment the neodymium magnet was submerged for 3 h and subsequently thoroughly rinsed with sufficient force with demineralized water to separate any material from the magnet and collected in a beaker this procedure was repeated three times the solid and liquid fraction of the obtained solution as well as the initial sludge sample were subsequently analysed for total and soluble fe and p concentrations to assess the vivianite recovery efficiency followed by direct reuse of the recovered fe for sulfide control in sewage see section 2 4 in the second step the obtained solution was subjected to alkaline conditions i e ph 13 for a duration of 1 h by adding 1m naoh in order to separate the vivianite into a solid fraction rich in iron obtained through centrifugation of the iron precipitates and a liquid fraction rich in p similar to prot et al 2019 total and soluble fe and p as well as po4 p before and after alkali addition was measured to quantify the recovery potential using this basic separation method the iron rich solid fraction was ground into a powder under anaerobic conditions and subsequently analysed employing x ray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds see section 2 5 2 4 sulfide removal experiments using recovered iron from digested sludge sulfide removal experiments n 12 were conducted using domestic wastewater under anaerobic conditions in gas tight cylindrical reactors made of perspex with a working volume of 500 ml domestic sewage was collected from a local pump station and immediately stored in a cold room at 4 c prior to use the sewage was filtered to remove any solids and heated up to ambient temperature the filtered sewage was sparged with n2 in order to maintain anaerobic condition during the experiment sulfide was spiked to the sewage to an initial concentration of 15 mgs l using standard reagent grade salt na2s 9h2o sigma aldrich the obtained iron rich solid fraction see section 2 3 was mixed with deoxygenated demineralized water to make a slurry 5 1 and 13 7 ml of the slurry was added to the reactor in order to obtain a fe concentration of 30 and 90 mg fe l leading to a fe s molar ratio of 1 2 1 and 3 5 1 respectively all experiments were conducted at a constant ph of 7 1 0 0 and ambient temperature 22 1 0 2 c 2 5 sludge characterization after collection all samples were immediately stored at 18 c and subsequently freeze dried under vacuum conditions 50 c 0 1 mbar afterwards the freeze dried samples were ground under anaerobic conditions the samples were subsequently characterized by means of xrd and sem eds x ray diffractograms were obtained with a d8 bruker diffractometer equipped with a θ 2θ goniometer and a position sensitive detector cu kα1 radiation at λ 1 55 å reflections were collected within the 5 80 2θ range with a step width of 0 02 and 1 2 s step of collecting time the resultant 2θ peaks were analysed with diffrac eva v 4 software and matched with the icdd pdf 4 2019 database semi quantitative xrd analyses were conducted to obtain the degree of crystallinity and to quantify the amount of vivianite in the samples using topas v 4 2 software corundum α al2o3 was used as an internal standard for all semi quantitative measurements all xrd and semi quantitative xrd analyses were conducted in triplicate in order to verify the amount of vivianite obtained from semi quantitative xrd analyses synthetic vivianite was prepared roldan et al 2002 and added to sludge samples with different quantities a more detailed description and results of these tests can be found in the supplementary information table s2 morphology and elemental composition of the samples were investigated by sem eds secondary electron images were obtained at 15 kv accelerating voltage using a high resolution scanning electron microscope jeol jsm 6610 equipped with an x ray detector for elemental analysis oxford instruments 50 mm2 x max sdd x ray detector samples were mounted on stubs attached with high purity conductive double sided adhesive carbon tapes and subsequently carbon coated using a quorum q150t turbo pumped sputter coater the latter was done to avoid charge build up on the sample to obtain better secondary electron signals 2 6 chemical analyses

meter sper scientific 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term monitoring of vivianite formation in thickened sbr and ad sludge in both cases of in sewer fecl3 and dws dosing at 10 mg fe l the dissolved sulfide concentrations in the sewer reactors were decreased substantially i e 48 4 and 38 2 furthermore the fe was reused for down stream p removal in the sbr 41 6 and 59 6 as well as sulfide control in the anaerobic digester 88 1 and 92 1 throughout the long term operation of the laboratory system as discussed in detail in previous studies rebosura et al 2018 2020 based on the reported values for p removal in the sbr in these studies it can be estimated that when the fes mixed sewage was transferred to the sbr about 90 of the fes was oxidized in the sbr which released the available fe to precipitate with p while the associated sulfide fraction was converted to sulfate and left the system via effluent table s4 equally important only a small fraction of the fe i e 2 4 2 6 of the total fe was released from the fep and used to control sulfide in the anaerobic digester table s4 the presence of poorly crystalline and or amorphous pyrite fes2 and troilite fes in both the thickened sbr and ad sludge was confirmed by xrd analysis fig s1 fig 1 ab shows the evolution of vivianite formation obtained from the semi quantitative xrd analyses in both thickened sbr sludge and ad sludge originating from in sewer dosed ferric chloride and dws respectively the degree of crystallinity of the inorganic fraction of the sludge samples increased over time importantly the figure shows that whether purchased ferric chloride coagulant or dws is dosed in the sewer reactor for sulfide control similar amounts of vivianite were formed in the downstream thickened sbr sludges and ad sludges after 5 months vivianite comprised 46 2 ferric chloride and 40 1 dws of the inorganic fraction in thickened sbr sludge the amount of vivianite of the inorganic fraction in ad sludge fraction was substantially higher with value of 68 2 and 60 2 for ferric chloride and dws dosing respectively the latter is not suprising as vivianite can be readily formed under reducing conditions and is in agreement with previous studies wilfert et al 2016 2018 the addition of different amounts of pure vivianite to the sludge samples confirmed that the accuracy of the vivianite quantification via semi quantitative xrd analysis see supplementary table s2 fig 2 shows the amount of in sewer dosed iron and phosphate present in the sewage that ultimately ends up in the form of vivianite in the digested sludge the majority of the in sewer dosed iron is bound in the digested sludge in vivianite in total 92 3 and 92 2 of the in sewer dosed ferric chloride and dws was bound in vivianite in the digested sludge respectively the lower obtained values for the p fraction of p bound in vivianite i e 54 2 and 49 1 for fecl3 and dws respectively can be explained by the fact that in our experiments the molar ratio of fe p in the digested sludge equalled to 0 87 0 88 as such there was not sufficient fe dosed to capture the p in the form of vivianite as this would require a fe p molar ratio of 1 5 1 it can be expected that at increasing fe p dosing rates higher percentages of p would be present in the form of vivianite indeed in a recent study it was reported that about 70 90 of p was captured as vivianite in the digested sludge at a molar fe p ratio of 2 5 1 wilfert et al 2018 3 2 magnetic separation of vivianite and recovery of fe via alkaline treatment simple insertion of a neodymium magnet allowed to recover between 11 0 2 and 15 3 0 08 of the vivianite formed in the digested sludge the values obtained in this study are somewhat lower than obtained in a recent laboratory scale study in which vivianite recovery efficiencies from digested sludge up to 32 were achieved using a μ jones magnetic separator prot et al 2019 xrd analysis of the magnetically separated solid fraction confirmed the presence of vivianite and its predominant crystalline nature fig 3 a which was also observed in sem eds analyses with abundance of crystalline vivianite aggregates fig s4 subsequent semi quantitative xrd revealed that vivianite fraction ranged between 49 3 and 70 5 of the inorganic fraction of the magnetically separated solids for in sewer dosed dws and fecl3 respectively table s5 these findings are in line with a previous study where similar values i e between 52 and 62 were reported prot et al 2019 fig 3b shows the x ray diffraction patterns of the magnetically separated fraction after the alkaline washing procedure the alkaline washing protocol clearly changed the highly crystalline nature of the vivianite to an amorphous composition moreover the x ray diffraction patterns strongly suggested that iron was separated from the vivianite and precipitated as ferrihydrite an amorphous hydrous ferric oxide mineral fe iii 2o3 0 5h2o smith et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 which was also observed visually with distinct change in colour from colourless to rusty brown common for ferric hydroxides fig s5 sem eds analyses of the separated ferrihydrite was shown in fig s6 the alkaline washing step was found to be very effective in separating the fe from vivianite with fe recovery efficiencies of 97 1 3 in sewer dosed fecl3 and 98 0 3 in sewer dosed dws equally important 90 0 3 in sewer dosed fecl3 and 87 1 in sewer dosed dws of vivianite bound p was released into the solution respectively table s6 3 3 reuse of recovered fe from vivianite for efficient sulfide control in sewage fig 4 shows that the addition of 5 1 and 13 7 mg amorphous ferrihydrite fe l equalling to a fe s molar ratio of 1 2 1 and 3 5 1 respectively resulted in effective sulfide precipitation the dissolved sulfide concentrations decreased from 15 mgs l to below 0 2 mgs l within 60 min after dosing fig 4 also shows that the kinetics of the reaction was fast with required hrts to reach sulfide levels below 0 5 mgs l of 30 and 60 min for ferrihydrite recovered from in sewer dosed fecl3 and dws respectively the pre equilibrium phase adsorption of sulfide at the oxide surface of ferrihydrite likely caused the rapid decrease in sulfide concentration during the first minute of the reaction afonso stumm 1992 canfield 1989 poulton et al 2004 previous studies investigating the reactivity of ferrihydrite with sulfide under reducing conditions in marine sediments found that the main mechanism for rapid sulfide precipitation was the reduction of ferrihydrite to form iron sulfide compounds fesx and complete removal of dissolved sulfide can be achieved if enough ferrihydrite is present the obtained results in this study suggest that the same mechanism occurred in the reducing sewer environment afonso stumm 1992 canfield 1989 poulton et al 2004 this hypothesis was further supported by xrd and sem eds analyses of the ferrihydrite after the end of the experiments which showed the presence of fes compounds on the surface fig s7 moreover the colour of the sewage turned black which is a typical phenomenon in situations where iron sulfide is formed 3 4 limitations of semi quantitative xrd analysis the vivianite standard addition tests showed that the semi quantitative xrd q xrd method provided reliable results with the obtained values of r2 close to unity i e r2 0 97 indicating a close correlation between vivianite standard addition and quantification by means of q xrd tables s2 and s3 our findings are supported by a recent study of wilfert et al 2018 in which a similar strong correlation was found wilfert et al 2018 while the q xrd is an important and widely used tool to quantify vivianite in the sludge matrix it also has several limitations that should be taken into consideration it is commonly accepted that vivianite in the wastewater treatment sludge usually contains impurities often caused by the presence of magnesium manganese copper and arsenic rothe et al 2016 roussel carliell marquet 2016 in a recent study it was highlighted that the presence of such impurities can affect the detection and subsequent quantification of true vivianite in the sludge samples for example the iron fraction in the vivianite can be replaced by cations such as magnesium or copper wilfert et al 2018 while the phosphate fraction in the mineral can be replaced by arsenic muehe et al 2016 the signal of such impurities can often not be distinguished from the signal of vivianite vivianite is prone to oxidation and can be easily partly oxidized during sample collection storage and preparation for analysis gonser grant 1976 rodgers henderson 1986 indeed it was found in a previous study that up to 28 of the vivianite in the digested sludge sample collected from a full scale wwtp was oxidized during sludge handling wilfert et al 2016 q xrd cannot detect and differentiate between the oxidized non oxidized fractions of vivianite the ideal particle size for q xrd analysis is between 10 and 50 μm pecharsky zavalij 2009 while 10 μm particles of vivianite can be present in the sludge as well see fig s4 in the supplementary information these smaller vivianite crystallites are likely not contributing to the observed signal in the q xrd analysis there is also uncertainty in determining the amorphous fraction of the sample in the rietveld refinement during q xrd analysis which was also highlighted in a recent study wilfert et al 2018 considering the above described limitations q xrd quantification of vivianite in sludge samples is difficult and the formation of pure vivianite in digested sludge sourced from in sewer iron dosing cannot be stated with certainty therefore the term vivianite used in this study in reality should be understood as vivianite like structures similar to wilfert et al 2018 3 5 implications for practice many wastewater utilities have set forward the ambition to transition into a circular management strategy for our urban wastewater management rather surprisingly despite the fact that coagulants play an important role in drinking water production and wastewater treatment and moreover are dosed in large amounts their role and importance in order for urban water management to fit within the circular economy has not received a lot of attention yet the use of coagulants is expected to further increase in the coming years due to a combination of factors including population growth stricter regulation and the need to protect existing urban water infrastructure bccresearch 2018 hence for our urban water infrastructure to become circular a complete revisiting of current coagulant management practice is desirable in this study we demonstrate for the first time a viable solution for selective recovery and reuse of iron targeting efficient sulfide control in sewers this is a first step towards a closed loop management strategy for iron based coagulants through long term experiments it was demonstrated that by dosing iron based dws and therefore substituting iron salt dosage in sewers a waste product generated during drinking water production can be turned into a valuable resource our approach also contributes to p recovery by forming vivianite in downstream wwtps as an intermediate product towards further reuse of both iron and phosphorus importantly over 90 of the iron in the dws added in the sewer was bound in vivianite in the digested sludge very similar to the value found for in sewer dosing of virgin coagulant in the form of fecl3 in our study vivianite was separated from digested sludge 15 3 0 08 efficiency by simple insertion of a neodymium magnet in the sludge liquor in order to become a full scale viable and mature technology it is essential to further increase vivianite recovery for this purpose vertically pulsating high gradient magnetic separators commonly used in the metallurgic industry can be used further research is warranted conducting long term testing at pilot and full scale to assess the maximum vivianite recovery efficiencies alkali addition to the separated vivianite was found very effective in separating the iron bound in crystalline vivianite thereby forming ferrihydrite this is important as it is known that ferrihydrite is an effective iron oxide adsorbent owing to their highly amorphous nature and higher surface areas borggaard 1983 parfitt et al 1975 wang et al 2013 wilfert et al 2015 indeed through sulfide precipitation experiments using real sewage we demonstrated that the ferrihydrite separated from vivianite can be directly reused in sewage for effective sulfide control achieving dissolved sulfide levels well below 1 mgs l similar to conventional dosing of iron salts to sewers for sulfide control firer et al 2008 nielsen et al 2005 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the recovery and reuse potential of in sewer dosed iron in the form of ferric chloride or iron rich drinking water sludge the latter was achieved through long term testing using continuous flow laboratory scale systems mimicking our urban wastewater infrastructure coupled with batch experiments for selective recovery of iron via a combination of magnetic separation and alkaline washing and subsequent sulfide precipitation tests using the recovered iron the key findings of the work are in sewer iron dosing resulted in efficient vivianite formation in digested sludge with over 90 of the in sewer dosed iron bound in vivianite in digested sludge the type of iron dosed namely virgin coagulant or ferric based drinking water sludge did not affect the vivianite formation potential in the digested sludge alkaline treatment of the recovered vivianite was very effective in selective separation of iron bound in vivianite in the form of ferrihydrite achieving near complete recovery efficiencies 98 0 3 direct reuse of the recovered ferrihydrite was found very effective in controlling dissolved sulfide in sewage to levels well below 1 mgs l overall the findings in this study can be seen as a first step for water utilities towards a closed loop management strategy for iron based coagulants

18057,iron based coagulants are dosed in enormous amounts and play an essential role in various segments of our urban water infrastructure in order for the water industry to become circular a closed loop management strategy for iron needs to be developed in this study we have demonstrated for the first time that in sewer dosed iron either in the form of fecl3 or ferric based drinking water sludge fe dws as a means to combat sewer corrosion and odour can be recovered in the form of vivianite in digested sludge in down stream wastewater treatment plants importantly about 92 2 of the in sewer dosed fe was estimated to be bound in vivianite in digested sludge a simple insertion of neodymium magnet allowed to recover 11 0 2 and 15 3 0 08 of the vivianite formed in the digested sludge of the in sewer dosed iron in the form of fecl3 and fe dws respectively the purity of recovered vivianite ranged between 70 5 and 49 3 for in sewer dosed fecl3 and fe dws respectively almost complete i e 98

efficient sulfide control in sewers at a ferrihydrite fe s molar ratio of 1 2 1 sewage dissolved sulfide concentrations was reduced from 15 mgs l to below 0 5 mgs l within 1 h of reaction overall the results obtained in our study flag a first step for utilities towards a closed loop iron based coagulant management approach keywords resource efficiency sulfide control coagulant recovery integrated management circular economy 1 introduction iron salts are dosed in enormous amounts and play a key role in wastewater treatment apgar et al 2007 bratby 2016 dewolfe et al 2003 pikaar et al 2014 they are the most commonly used sulfide control chemicals to combat concrete corrosion and odour problems in sewer networks apgar et al 2007 ganigue et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 moreover the addition of iron salts is a prevalent approach for removing phosphate carliell marquet cooper 2014 de bashan et al 2004 korving et al 2019 and for controlling sulfide during anaerobic digestion in downstream wastewater treatment plants wwtps akgul et al 2017 charles et al 2006 we recently demonstrated that by adopting a catchment wide iron salts dosing strategy the overall iron consumption can be reduced while increasing the overall treatment performance in terms of sulfide control and phosphate removal rebosura et al 2018 salehin et al 2019 through both comprehensive laboratory scale testing and long term field studies it was found that ferrous or ferric chloride dosed to sewer networks to control hydrogen sulfide emissions is reused multiple times in downstream wastewater treatment plants for the removal of phosphate as well as hydrogen sulfide control during anaerobic digestion rebosura et al 2018 salehin et al 2019 the latter can be considered as a major step forward for the water industry as significant benefits can be achieved in terms of treatment performance for the overall urban water infrastructure by simply replacing the chemical dosing location to the upstream sewer network salehin et al 2019 iron salts are also often used as coagulant during drinking water production for the removal of natural organic matter turbidity colour and pathogens matilainen et al 2010 okour et al 2009 management of iron rich drinking water sludge often incurs substantial operational expenditure frias et al 2013 keeley et al 2016 due to the fact that iron based drinking water sludge is relatively low in organics and high in iron content babatunde zhao 2007 it has the potential to be beneficially reused for sulfide control in sewer networks as well as in the down stream wwtp for phosphate removal and sulfide control during anaerobic digestion similar to that of conventional iron salt dosing indeed recent studies demonstrated that ferric chloride based drinking water sludge can effectively control sulfide in sewers rebosura et al 2020 sun et al 2015 and effectively reused in downstream wwtps for phosphate removal and sulfide control during anaerobic digestion rebosura et al 2020 while these above described studies clearly demonstrated the practical feasibility of multiple iron reuse the iron species and potential changes in its speciation in the sewer network activated sludge tank and anaerobic digester has not been investigated in detail yet iron chemistry is complex and can undergo rapid transformations between ferrous fe ii ferric fe iii and mixed forms in wastewater due to variations in prevalent redox potentials moreover microbial induced oxidation reduction processes in aerobic and anaerobic zones can also occur nielsen et al 2005 wilfert et al 2015 as iron speciation may affect the reaction stoichiometry and kinetics it is important to determine the speciation and fate of sewer dosed iron in the downstream wwtp equally important such information is also essential to identify opportunities to recover iron from the sludge at the downstream wwtps after multiple usage recently various studies reported on the formation of vivianite i e an iron phosphate mineral fe ii 3 po4 2 8h2o at wwtps where iron salts either ferrous or ferric are dosed for phosphate removal wilfert et al 2016 2018 more recently laboratory scale experiments showed that vivianite formed in digested sludge can be recovered using a magnetic separator prot et al 2019 while it was found that further research is needed to improve the vivianite recovery efficiency this finding is important as it clearly highlighted the potential for selective recovery of iron from digested sludge to the authors best knowledge the fate of in sewer dosed iron either in the form of iron salts or iron rich drinking water sludge in the downstream wastewater treatment plants has not been investigated in detail yet therefore this study aimed to investigate the iron speciation and vivianite formation potential of in sewer dosed iron either in the form of ferric chloride and iron rich drinking water sludge through comprehensive long term testing using continuous flow laboratory scale systems used to simulate an urban wastewater system over a period of 31 months combined semi quantitative in depth xrd and sem eds analyses were used to investigate iron speciation and to quantify the amount of vivianite formed in waste activated sludge and digested sludge we also evaluated the practical feasibility of an interesting alternative valorisation route not focusing on the recovery of p but on the recovery and direct reuse of separated fe in the form of ferrihydrite as an effective sulfide control method in sewer networks 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory scale urban wastewater system two previously reported laboratory scale systems were used in this study one of which was used as the experimental line and the other as the control line each line compromised two sewer reactors a sequence batch reactor sbr for biological cod chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen removal a sludge thickener and an anaerobic sludge digester for biogas production the sewer reactors were fed with 10 l of raw sewage per day divided into four pumping events of 2 5 l every 6 h with a working volume of 8 5 l the sbr was maintained with a cycle time of 6 h 2 h of anoxic mixing 3 h of aerobic mixing 45 min of settling and 15 min of decanting 2 5 l of wastewater was fed to the sbr in the first 8 min of the anoxic phase the sbr was operated at a sludge retention time of 16 days the sludge thickener with a volume of 3 l was intermittently stirred at 2 rpm to produce the thickened sludge the anaerobic sludge digesters had a working volume of 1 l and a headspace of 300 ml the digesters were fed with 50 ml of thickened sludge per day resulting in a hrt of 20 days 50 ml of digested sludge was taken out from the reactor at the same time the domestic wastewater in the experiments was collected from a residential area in brisbane as described in detail elsewhere rebosura et al 2018 2020 2 2 reactor operation and sampling protocol the experiments were conducted over a period of 31 months and divided into four phases 1 baseline phase months 0 13 2 experimental phase i with in sewer ferric chloride dosing months 14 18 to the experimental line 3 recovery phase without any chemical dosing months 19 26 and 4 experimental phase ii with in sewer dosing of ferric based drinking water sludge referred to as dws here onwards months 27 31 to the new experimental line the control line in phase i during the baseline phase the two systems were operated identically without any chemical dosing until comparable performance was obtained in terms of biological nutrient and cod removal performance i e pseudo steady state in total this baseline period lasted for 13 months in experimental phase i ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o was added to the sewer reactor of the experimental line for a duration of 5 months throughout the duration of 5 months the dosing rate was maintained constant at a dosing rate of 10 mg fe3 l rebosura et al 2018 in the recovery phase which lasted for 8 months ferric chloride dosing was stopped and the two lines were operated identically for the two lines to achieve similar performance in the experimental phase ii dws was added to the sewer reactor of the new experimental line the previous control line for another 5 months the iron rich drinking water sludge used in this study originated from the cascade drinking water treatment plant operated by sydney water in new south wales australia a more detailed characterization of the dws can be found in the supplementary information table s1 the dws was dosed to the sewer reactor in the form of a slurry in order to obtain iron concentrations of 10 mg fe3 l similar to the experimental phase i thickened waste activated sludge 15 20 ml and digested sludge 50 ml samples were collected from both the control and experimental lines at the end of months 1 3 and 5 in both experimental phases as well as in the recovery phase the samples were collected in sterile screw cap containers flushed with nitrogen and immediately stored in a freezer at 18 c afterwards the samples were freeze dried and ground to powder form in anaerobic conditions for subsequent xrd combined with semi quantitative sem eds and icp oes analyses for detailed characterization and elemental composition see section 2 5 and 2 6 2 3 magnetic separation of vivianite and iron recovery via alkaline washing the sludge samples of the anaerobic digester at the end of both experimental phases were subjected to a two step approach as a means to selectively recover and reuse the iron from the digested sludge n 6 in the first step vivianite as discovered by the xrd combined with semi quantitative and sem eds analyses was separated from the sludge via the magnetic separation experiments for this purpose neodymium magnets 36 mm diameter and 8 mm thickness with a pull force of 48 kg were submerged into 200 ml of digested sludge liquor the solution was gently mixed using an overhead stirrer at a rate of 15 rpm in each magnetic separation experiment the neodymium magnet was submerged for 3 h and subsequently thoroughly rinsed with sufficient force with demineralized water to separate any material from the magnet and collected in a beaker this procedure was repeated three times the solid and liquid fraction of the obtained solution as well as the initial sludge sample were subsequently analysed for total and soluble fe and p concentrations to assess the vivianite recovery efficiency followed by direct reuse of the recovered fe for sulfide control in sewage see section 2 4 in the second step the obtained solution was subjected to alkaline conditions i e ph 13 for a duration of 1 h by adding 1m naoh in order to separate the vivianite into a solid fraction rich in iron obtained through centrifugation of the iron precipitates and a liquid fraction rich in p similar to prot et al 2019 total and soluble fe and p as well as po4 p before and after alkali addition was measured to quantify the recovery potential using this basic separation method the iron rich solid fraction was ground into a powder under anaerobic conditions and subsequently analysed employing x ray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds see section 2 5 2 4 sulfide removal experiments using recovered iron from digested sludge sulfide removal experiments n 12 were conducted using domestic wastewater under anaerobic conditions in gas tight cylindrical reactors made of perspex with a working volume of 500 ml domestic sewage was collected from a local pump station and immediately stored in a cold room at 4 c prior to use the sewage was filtered to remove any solids and heated up to ambient temperature the filtered sewage was sparged with n2 in order to maintain anaerobic condition during the experiment sulfide was spiked to the sewage to an initial concentration of 15 mgs l using standard reagent grade salt na2s 9h2o sigma aldrich the obtained iron rich solid fraction see section 2 3 was mixed with deoxygenated demineralized water to make a slurry 5 1 and 13 7 ml of the slurry was added to the reactor in order to obtain a fe concentration of 30 and 90 mg fe l leading to a fe s molar ratio of 1 2 1 and 3 5 1 respectively all experiments were conducted at a constant ph of 7 1 0 0 and ambient temperature 22 1 0 2 c 2 5 sludge characterization after collection all samples were immediately stored at 18 c and subsequently freeze dried under vacuum conditions 50 c 0 1 mbar afterwards the freeze dried samples were ground under anaerobic conditions the samples were subsequently characterized by means of xrd and sem eds x ray diffractograms were obtained with a d8 bruker diffractometer equipped with a θ 2θ goniometer and a position sensitive detector cu kα1 radiation at λ 1 55 å reflections were collected within the 5 80 2θ range with a step width of 0 02 and 1 2 s step of collecting time the resultant 2θ peaks were analysed with diffrac eva v 4 software and matched with the icdd pdf 4 2019 database semi quantitative xrd analyses were conducted to obtain the degree of crystallinity and to quantify the amount of vivianite in the samples using topas v 4 2 software corundum α al2o3 was used as an internal standard for all semi quantitative measurements all xrd and semi quantitative xrd analyses were conducted in triplicate in order to verify the amount of vivianite obtained from semi quantitative xrd analyses synthetic vivianite was prepared roldan et al 2002 and added to sludge samples with different quantities a more detailed description and results of these tests can be found in the supplementary information table s2 morphology and elemental composition of the samples were investigated by sem eds secondary electron images were obtained at 15 kv accelerating voltage using a high resolution scanning electron microscope jeol jsm 6610 equipped with an x ray detector for elemental analysis oxford instruments 50 mm2 x max sdd x ray detector samples were mounted on stubs attached with high purity conductive double sided adhesive carbon tapes and subsequently carbon coated using a quorum q150t turbo pumped sputter coater the latter was done to avoid charge build up on the sample to obtain better secondary electron signals 2 6 chemical analyses

sulfide concentrations in the sewer reactors were decreased substantially i e 48 4 and 38 2 furthermore the fe was reused for down stream p removal in the sbr 41 6 and 59 6 as well as sulfide control in the anaerobic digester 88 1 and 92 1 throughout the long term operation of the laboratory system as discussed in detail in previous studies rebosura et al 2018 2020 based on the reported values for p removal in the sbr in these studies it can be estimated that when the fes mixed sewage was transferred to the sbr about 90 of the fes was oxidized in the sbr which released the available fe to precipitate with p while the associated sulfide fraction was converted to sulfate and left the system via effluent table s4 equally important only a small fraction of the fe i e 2 4 2 6 of the total fe was released from the fep and used to control sulfide in the anaerobic digester table s4 the presence of poorly crystalline and or amorphous pyrite fes2 and troilite fes in both the thickened sbr and ad sludge was confirmed by xrd analysis fig s1 fig 1 ab shows the evolution of vivianite formation obtained from the semi quantitative xrd analyses in both thickened sbr sludge and ad sludge originating from in sewer dosed ferric chloride and dws respectively the degree of crystallinity of the inorganic fraction of the sludge samples increased over time importantly the figure shows that whether purchased ferric chloride coagulant or dws is dosed in the sewer reactor for sulfide control similar amounts of vivianite were formed in the downstream thickened sbr sludges and ad sludges after 5 months vivianite comprised 46 2 ferric chloride and 40 1 dws of the inorganic fraction in thickened sbr sludge the amount of vivianite of the inorganic fraction in ad sludge fraction was substantially higher with value of 68 2 and 60 2 for ferric chloride and dws dosing respectively the latter is not suprising as vivianite can be readily formed under reducing conditions and is in agreement with previous studies wilfert et al 2016 2018 the addition of different amounts of pure vivianite to the sludge samples confirmed that the accuracy of the vivianite quantification via semi quantitative xrd analysis see supplementary table s2 fig 2 shows the amount of in sewer dosed iron and phosphate present in the sewage that ultimately ends up in the form of vivianite in the digested sludge the majority of the in sewer dosed iron is bound in the digested sludge in vivianite in total 92 3 and 92 2 of the in sewer dosed ferric chloride and dws was bound in vivianite in the digested sludge respectively the lower obtained values for the p fraction of p bound in vivianite i e 54 2 and 49 1 for fecl3 and dws respectively can be explained by the fact that in our experiments the molar ratio of fe p in the digested sludge equalled to 0 87 0 88 as such there was not sufficient fe dosed to capture the p in the form of vivianite as this would require a fe p molar ratio of 1 5 1 it can be expected that at increasing fe p dosing rates higher percentages of p would be present in the form of vivianite indeed in a recent study it was reported that about 70 90 of p was captured as vivianite in the digested sludge at a molar fe p ratio of 2 5 1 wilfert et al 2018 3 2 magnetic separation of vivianite and recovery of fe via alkaline treatment simple insertion of a neodymium magnet allowed to recover between 11 0 2 and 15 3 0 08 of the vivianite formed in the digested sludge the values obtained in this study are somewhat lower than obtained in a recent laboratory scale study in which vivianite recovery efficiencies from digested sludge up to 32 were achieved using a μ jones magnetic separator prot et al 2019 xrd analysis of the magnetically separated solid fraction confirmed the presence of vivianite and its predominant crystalline nature fig 3 a which was also observed in sem eds analyses with abundance of crystalline vivianite aggregates fig s4 subsequent semi quantitative xrd revealed that vivianite fraction ranged between 49 3 and 70 5 of the inorganic fraction of the magnetically separated solids for in sewer dosed dws and fecl3 respectively table s5 these findings are in line with a previous study where similar values i e between 52 and 62 were reported prot et al 2019 fig 3b shows the x ray diffraction patterns of the magnetically separated fraction after the alkaline washing procedure the alkaline washing protocol clearly changed the highly crystalline nature of the vivianite to an amorphous composition moreover the x ray diffraction patterns strongly suggested that iron was separated from the vivianite and precipitated as ferrihydrite an amorphous hydrous ferric oxide mineral fe iii 2o3 0 5h2o smith et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 which was also observed visually with distinct change in colour from colourless to rusty brown common for ferric hydroxides fig s5 sem eds analyses of the separated ferrihydrite was shown in fig s6 the alkaline washing step was found to be very effective in separating the fe from vivianite with fe recovery efficiencies of 97 1 3 in sewer dosed fecl3 and 98 0 3 in sewer dosed dws equally important 90 0 3 in sewer dosed fecl3 and 87 1 in sewer dosed dws of vivianite bound p was released into the solution respectively table s6 3 3 reuse of recovered fe from vivianite for efficient sulfide control in sewage fig 4 shows that the addition of 5 1 and 13 7 mg amorphous ferrihydrite fe l equalling to a fe s molar ratio of 1 2 1 and 3 5 1 respectively resulted in effective sulfide precipitation the dissolved sulfide concentrations decreased from 15 mgs l to below 0 2 mgs l within 60 min after dosing fig 4 also shows that the kinetics of the reaction was fast with required hrts to reach sulfide levels below 0 5 mgs l of 30 and 60 min for ferrihydrite recovered from in sewer dosed fecl3 and dws respectively the pre equilibrium phase adsorption of sulfide at the oxide surface of ferrihydrite likely caused the rapid decrease in sulfide concentration during the first minute of the reaction afonso stumm 1992 canfield 1989 poulton et al 2004 previous studies investigating the reactivity of ferrihydrite with sulfide under reducing conditions in marine sediments found that the main mechanism for rapid sulfide precipitation was the reduction of ferrihydrite to form iron sulfide compounds fesx and complete removal of dissolved sulfide can be achieved if enough ferrihydrite is present the obtained results in this study suggest that the same mechanism occurred in the reducing sewer environment afonso stumm 1992 canfield 1989 poulton et al 2004 this hypothesis was further supported by xrd and sem eds analyses of the ferrihydrite after the end of the experiments which showed the presence of fes compounds on the surface fig s7 moreover the colour of the sewage turned black which is a typical phenomenon in situations where iron sulfide is formed 3 4 limitations of semi quantitative xrd analysis the vivianite standard addition tests showed that the semi quantitative xrd q xrd method provided reliable results with the obtained values of r2 close to unity i e r2 0 97 indicating a close correlation between vivianite standard addition and quantification by means of q xrd tables s2 and s3 our findings are supported by a recent study of wilfert et al 2018 in which a similar strong correlation was found wilfert et al 2018 while the q xrd is an important and widely used tool to quantify vivianite in the sludge matrix it also has several limitations that should be taken into consideration it is commonly accepted that vivianite in the wastewater treatment sludge usually contains impurities often caused by the presence of magnesium manganese copper and arsenic rothe et al 2016 roussel carliell marquet 2016 in a recent study it was highlighted that the presence of such impurities can affect the detection and subsequent quantification of true vivianite in the sludge samples for example the iron fraction in the vivianite can be replaced by cations such as magnesium or copper wilfert et al 2018 while the phosphate fraction in the mineral can be replaced by arsenic muehe et al 2016 the signal of such impurities can often not be distinguished from the signal of vivianite vivianite is prone to oxidation and can be easily partly oxidized during sample collection storage and preparation for analysis gonser grant 1976 rodgers henderson 1986 indeed it was found in a previous study that up to 28 of the vivianite in the digested sludge sample collected from a full scale wwtp was oxidized during sludge handling wilfert et al 2016 q xrd cannot detect and differentiate between the oxidized non oxidized fractions of vivianite the ideal particle size for q xrd analysis is between 10 and 50 μm pecharsky zavalij 2009 while 10 μm particles of vivianite can be present in the sludge as well see fig s4 in the supplementary information these smaller vivianite crystallites are likely not contributing to the observed signal in the q xrd analysis there is also uncertainty in determining the amorphous fraction of the sample in the rietveld refinement during q xrd analysis which was also highlighted in a recent study wilfert et al 2018 considering the above described limitations q xrd quantification of vivianite in sludge samples is difficult and the formation of pure vivianite in digested sludge sourced from in sewer iron dosing cannot be stated with certainty therefore the term vivianite used in this study in reality should be understood as vivianite like structures similar to wilfert et al 2018 3 5 implications for practice many wastewater utilities have set forward the ambition to transition into a circular management strategy for our urban wastewater management rather surprisingly despite the fact that coagulants play an important role in drinking water production and wastewater treatment and moreover are dosed in large amounts their role and importance in order for urban water management to fit within the circular economy has not received a lot of attention yet the use of coagulants is expected to further increase in the coming years due to a combination of factors including population growth stricter regulation and the need to protect existing urban water infrastructure bccresearch 2018 hence for our urban water infrastructure to become circular a complete revisiting of current coagulant management practice is desirable in this study we demonstrate for the first time a viable solution for selective recovery and reuse of iron targeting efficient sulfide control in sewers this is a first step towards a closed loop management strategy for iron based coagulants through long term experiments it was demonstrated that by dosing iron based dws and therefore substituting iron salt dosage in sewers a waste product generated during drinking water production can be turned into a valuable resource our approach also contributes to p recovery by forming vivianite in downstream wwtps as an intermediate product towards further reuse of both iron and phosphorus importantly over 90 of the iron in the dws added in the sewer was bound in vivianite in the digested sludge very similar to the value found for in sewer dosing of virgin coagulant in the form of fecl3 in our study vivianite was separated from digested sludge 15 3 0 08 efficiency by simple insertion of a neodymium magnet in the sludge liquor in order to become a full scale viable and mature technology it is essential to further increase vivianite recovery for this purpose vertically pulsating high gradient magnetic separators commonly used in the metallurgic industry can be used further research is warranted conducting long term testing at pilot and full scale to assess the maximum vivianite recovery efficiencies alkali addition to the separated vivianite was found very effective in separating the iron bound in crystalline vivianite thereby forming ferrihydrite this is important as it is known that ferrihydrite is an effective iron oxide adsorbent owing to their highly amorphous nature and higher surface areas borggaard 1983 parfitt et al 1975 wang et al 2013 wilfert et al 2015 indeed through sulfide precipitation experiments using real sewage we demonstrated that the ferrihydrite separated from vivianite can be directly reused in sewage for effective sulfide control achieving dissolved sulfide levels well below 1 mgs l similar to conventional dosing of iron salts to sewers for sulfide control firer et al 2008 nielsen et al 2005 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the recovery and reuse potential of in sewer dosed iron in the form of ferric chloride or iron rich drinking water sludge the latter was achieved through long term testing using continuous flow laboratory scale systems mimicking our urban wastewater infrastructure coupled with batch experiments for selective recovery of iron via a combination of magnetic separation and alkaline washing and subsequent sulfide precipitation tests using the recovered iron the key findings of the work are in sewer iron dosing resulted in efficient vivianite formation in digested sludge with over 90 of the in sewer dosed iron bound in vivianite in digested sludge the type of iron dosed namely virgin coagulant or ferric based drinking water sludge did not affect the vivianite formation potential in the digested sludge alkaline treatment of the recovered vivianite was very effective in selective separation of iron bound in vivianite in the form of ferrihydrite achieving near complete recovery efficiencies 98 0 3 direct reuse of the recovered ferrihydrite was found very effective in controlling dissolved sulfide in sewage to levels well below 1 mgs l overall the findings in this study can be seen as a first step for water utilities towards a closed loop management strategy for iron based coagulants

18058,in this work fe ii catalyzing sodium percarbonate fe ii spc was managed to facilitate waste activated sludge was dewatering for the first time the results showed that after was was treated by 20 mg g total suspended solids tss fe ii and 50 mg g tss spc the water content of sludge cake wcsc by press filtration and capillary suction time cst dropped from 90 8 1 6 and 96 1 4 0 s the control to 55 6 1 4 and 30 1 2 5 s respectively the mechanism investigations indicated that four intermediates or products i e oh h2o2 fe ii and fe iii generated in the fe ii spc process were responsible for the improved was dewaterability and oh and fe iii were the two major contributors it was found that oh collapsed and fragmented extracellular polymeric substances damaged cell wall and permeabilized cytoplasmic membrane and transformed conformation of the extracellular proteins secondary structure via both affecting the hydrogen bond maintaining α helix and cracking disulfide bond in cysteine residues while fe iii the oxidization product of fe ii decreased the surface electronegativity and water affinity surface areas of was flocs as a result the bound water release flocculability surface hydrophobicity drain capability and flowability of was flocs were strengthened whereas the compact surface structure colloidal forces network strength gel like structure and apparent viscosity of was flocs were weakened in addition fe ii spc process also reduced the recalcitrant organics and fecal coliforms in sludge which facilitated land application of dewatered sludge the findings acquired in this work not only deepens our understanding of fe ii spc involved was treatment process but also may guide engineers to develop both effective and promising strategies to better condition was for dewatering in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords fe ii sodium percarbonate sludge dewaterability physicochemical characteristics rheological properties extracellular polymeric substances

produced from biological wastewater treatment process which poses a great threat to both the ecological environment and human health li et al 2019a liu et al 2020a 2020b wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2020 wu et al 2019a xu et al 2019 zhang and chen 2020 the management of was is an important part of wwtps which accounts for 30 60 of the total operating cost of a wwtp luo et al 2020 wang et al 2018c the improvement in was dewatering is effective to cut the costs of sludge treatment transportation and subsequent disposal wei et al 2018a hence substantial efforts were made to develop the techniques for sludge dewatering in the past years feng et al 2009 li et al 2019d masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 na et al 2007 wang et al 2018b wu et al 2016b multiple approaches such as electrolysis ultrasonic skeleton materials flocculants coagulants and chemical oxidation processes were attempted to enhance was dewatering feng et al 2009 masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 na et al 2007 wang et al 2018b wu et al 2016b among them chemical oxidation coagulation process has attracted increasing attention in such a scheme chemical oxidants such as oxone sodium hypochlorite naclo and potassium permanganate kmno4 were first used to oxidize was flocs and then coagulants e g fe iii were employed to agglomerate the preoxidized was flocs lv et al 2019 wei et al 2019 wu et al 2017b although this chemical oxidation coagulation process was demonstrated to be effective its practical application was limited by the expensive price the potential risk in formation of halogenated organics or the increased colourity of dewatering filtrate sun et al 2018 wu et al 2017b yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b sodium percarbonate spc na2co3 1 5h2o2 is an effective relatively inexpensive and environment friendly oxidant when spc enters into water it can disassociate to na2co3 and h2o2 equation 1 which therefore exhibit a certain level of oxidizability fu et al 2015 the oxidizability would amplify in the presence of fe ii under acidic ambient as the strong oxidizing and nonselective hydroxyl radicals oh would be produced during fe ii catalyzing spc fe ii spc process via equation 2 fu et al 2015 due to this property fe ii spc process has been growingly employed in the remediation of groundwater or surface water and soil polluted by organic pollutants recently fu et al 2015 wang et al 2018a yan et al 2018 for instance fu and his co workers found that more than 95 of benzene 1 mm was degraded by fe ii spc at ph 3 for 20 min treatment fu et al 2015 the property and previous investigations enlighten us to raise such a hypothesis that fe ii spc treatment might be effective in promoting was dewaterability as a solid precursor of oh spc is not only convenient to handle at real world situations but also safe in the transportation and storage processes zhang et al 2018 moreover the price of spc is about 560 t which is lower than that of several common oxidants such as oxone 1300 t and permanganate 1881 t fu et al 2015 guo et al 2017 shi et al 2015 the added fe ii salt which is cheaper than fe iii salt 160 t for fe iii vs 80 t for fe ii li et al 2016 wei et al 2018b yu et al 2016 has dual functions i e as a catalyst to initiate the fenton reaction in fe ii spc process and as a coagulant in was dewatering process in addition no toxic intermediates or products were produced in this process equations 1 and 2 thus fe ii spc treatment will be economically attractive and environment friendly for practical applications if it is proven to be effective to date however no information is available to whether and how fe ii spc treatment enhances was dewatering 1 na 2 co 3 1 5 h 2 o 2 na 2 co 3 1 5 h 2 o 2 2 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh ho therefore the goal of this work is to investigate the effect of fe ii spc treatment on was dewaterability and to explore the relevant mechanism through a series of batch tests and analyses with the schematic diagram of experimental design being outlined in fig s1 to acquire comprehensive information the capillary suction time cst of sludge and water content of sludge cake wcsc after fe ii spc treatment under different dosages of fe ii 0 20 mg g tss and spc 0 100 mg g tss were first compared then details of how fe ii spc enhances was dewaterability were investigated via analyzing the effects of fe ii spc treatment on the physiochemical rheological extracellular polymeric substances eps characteristics and cell physiological status of was thirdly the potential contributions of oh h2o2 fe ii and fe iii to the improved dewaterability treatment were identified finally the effects of fe ii spc treatment on the contents of recalcitrant organics and fecal coliforms in dewatered was were examined the work demonstrated for the first time that fe ii spc treatment improved was dewaterability and uncovered the underlying mechanism the findings acquired not only deepens our understanding of fe ii spc involved was dewatering but also may guide engineers to exploit promising strategies to handle was dewatering in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples and reagents was was collected from a wwtp

2017 2 5 statistical analysis all the tests were performed in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of results with the software spss 22 0 and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 the dewaterability of was after fe ii spc treatment fig 1 shows the was dewaterability after treatment by various dosages of fe ii catalyzed spc it was found that individual fe ii or spc treatment did not obviously elevate was dewaterability for instance after was was treated by individual fe ii 0 20 mg g tss or spc 0 100 mg g tss no significant variation was observed in values of cst or wcsc vacuum filtration however after was was treated by the combination of spc and fe ii was dewaterability was greatly improved after an increment of spc addition from 0 to 100 mg g tss the value of cst decreased from 94 2 3 2 to 60 1 1 9 s in f2 group i e in the presence of 2 mg g tss fe ii 93 3 2 4 to 46 8 2 5 s in f10 group and 91 7 3 1 to 30 1 2 5 s in f20 group fig 1a similar tendency was also observed on wcsc by vacuum filtration fig 1b the results suggested that 20 mg g tss fe ii and 50 mg g tss spc were the optimum dosages with 32 9 2 1 s of cst and 68 1 0 7 of wcsc by vacuum filtration being measured respectively moreover 55 6 1 4 of wcsc after press filtration was determined in this scenario while 37 2 kg of the mass of dewatering filtrate was measured fig 1c and d clearly fe ii spc treatment significantly improved was dewatering and solid content of sludge cake in the following text the mechanism of how fe ii spc treatment affects the dewaterability of was was explored 3 2 the effect of fe ii spc treatment on physicochemical properties of was the performance of sludge dewatering is closely related to several crucial physicochemical properties of sludge such as bound water floc size fractal dimension hydrophobicity zeta potential and microstructure jin et al 2003 li et al 2019f li and yang 2007 liu et al 2016a wilén et al 2003 zhen et al 2012b thus we first assessed how fe ii spc treatment affects these key physicochemical properties water contained in sludge is generally categorized into two types i e free water and bound water under mechanical force the former is easily drainable while the latter is hard to be dehydrated for it is tightly bound to eps or other ingredients of sludge cai et al 2018 guo et al 2017 therefore bound water is one of the key factors related to sludge dewatering cai et al 2018 guo et al 2017 fig 2 a shows the change in total bound water eps bound water and intracellular water of was samples by different treatments the bound water content in the fe ii spc treated sample was less than that in either the control or the sample treated by sole fe ii or spc for example 1 60 0 04 g g tss of total bound water was measured in the fe ii spc treated sample while the corresponding value was 1 95 0 06 g g tss in the control 1 85 0 04 g g tss in the fe ii treated sample and 1 88 0 03 g g tss in the spc treated sample fig 2a similar observations were also made on the variations in eps bound water and intracellular water fig 2a the results indicated that fe ii spc treatment reduced eps bound and intracellular water in was which accelerated the conversion of bound water to free water in sludge and therefore enhanced the amount of drainable water fig 1d fig 2b displays the variations in particle size d0 5 of sludge by different treatments compared with the control or sole treatments fe ii spc treatment elevated the particle size of sludge the particle size was 51 5 0 3 μm in the control 53 0 0 4 μm in the fe ii treated sludge and 51 3 0 5 μm in the spc treated sludge while the corresponding data was 54 6 0 4 μm in the fe ii spc treated sludge previous literature reported that an increment of particle size lessens the exposure of sludge surface and thereby averts the small sludge particles from sealing filter medium and cake layer during filtration zhen et al 2012b fractal dimension is an indicator reflecting the morphology of sludge flocs and an increment of fractal dimension suggests an enhancement of compactness and denseness in surface structure dai et al 2018 after fe ii spc treatment fractal dimension of was decreased from 2 11 0 004 to 2 03 0 01 indicating the reduction in compact structure of sludge fig 2b these results suggested that after fe ii spc treatment was flocs became larger and looser than their status in the control which promoted the passage of water during compression stage bian et al 2018 it was ulteriorly found that fe ii spc treatment increased the contact angle of sludge from 95 1 to 131 3 fig 2c which suggests an enhancement in hydrophobicity of was after fe ii spc treatment previous reference documented that sludge flocculability was primarily affected by hydrophobic interactions electrostatic interactions and polymer bridging wilén et al 2003 the improvement of hydrophobicity contributes to the decrease of water binding and facilitate the agglomeration of sludge li et al 2019b zeta potential is an important factor in sludge aggregating or dispersing li et al 2019b it was found that the zeta potential was 11 2 0 8 mv in the control 8 5 0 7 mv in the fe ii treated was and 10 8 0 5 mv in the spc treated was fig 2d after was was treated by fe ii spc this value increased to 4 3 0 6 mv fig 2d it is known that a reduction of negative charge reflects a decrease in electrostatic repulsive interactions benefiting sludge particle collision destabilization and flocculation setting liu et al 2016a previous studies also reported that the dewatering performance improved when the absolute value of sludge zeta potential decreased li et al 2016 which was consistent with the results obtained in fig 2d fig 2e shows microtopography differences observed in the sludge with or without fe ii spc treatment the surface of sludge cake without treatment i e the control was highly coarse but compact and condensed without large openings which prevented the inner layer water from expelling however after fe ii spc treatment a flake shaped and or block shaped structure with notable cracks pores was formed in the was surface which was covered with plentiful iron species the porosity structure could weaken the storage capacity for water molecules held in the tiny pores of sludge dai et al 2018 rao et al 2019 and these channels could serve as drainage for the water outflow dai et al 2018 rao et al 2019 moreover sludge volumes in the fe ii spc treated sample were bigger than those in the control which accorded with the results of particle size shown in fig 2b the results suggested that fe ii spc treatment induced the formation of internal channels with large pores which thereby promoted the discharge of water 3 3 the effect of fe ii spc treatment on rheological properties of was rheology is a useful tool for studying the deformation and flow of the materials such as sludge suspension wang et al 2016a it is reported that sludge rheological behavior is also related to sludge dewaterability liu et al 2016a therefore we assessed the effect of fe ii spc treatment on the rheological properties of was as well in the literature wang et al 2017 viscous viscoplastic properties and viscoelastic properties were investigated by a rotational rheometer under steady shear test and dynamic measurement respectively it can be seen from fig 3 a that under the steady shear test the flow curves of all the was samples conformed to the herschel bulkley equation fig 3a based on the calculations according to the herschel bulkley model equation s 2 it was found that fe ii spc treatment elevated the flow behavior index n but decreased the consistency of sludge k fig 3a an increment of n indicates that sludge was transformed toward a newtonian fluids with increased fluidity while a decrement of k value suggests the decreased apparent viscosity li et al 2019b xiao et al 2017 several investigators showed that the diminution of apparent viscosity was mainly attributed to the disorganization of sludge colloids yuan et al 2011 the results reflected that fe ii spc treatment reduced the apparent viscosity but elevated the flowability probably due to the destruction of inner structure of sludge colloids kept by net like eps matrix also from fig 3a it can be observed that the values of shear stress on the descending path in all the scenarios were lower than those on the ascending path which thereby formed a hysteresis loop between the two paths the hysteresis loop area can be employed to indicate the extent of thixotropic behavior of the sludge which reflects the breakdown and build up processes in internal structures of sludge by measuring the area of the loop wu et al 2019b and strong thixotropy of sludge suggests strong colloidal forces among sludge particles which tend to rebuild the structures zhang et al 2019a according to the calculations the hysteresis loop area of the fe ii spc treated sludge was 345 6 pa s 1 which was lower than that of other samples 488 3 pa s 1 in the control 385 5 pa s 1 in the fe ii treated sample and 412 1 pa s 1 treated in the spc treated sample reflecting that fe ii spc treated sample reached steady status faster than other samples the result suggested that fe ii spc treatment efficaciously weakened the colloidal forces which was further confirmed in fig 3b as shown in fig 3b all the relative pairs of curves presented analogous development of the storage modulus g and loss modulus g under the dynamic measurement mode a linear viscoelastic lve region was seen at low strain about γ 0 5 in which g and g maintained almost constant fe ii spc treatment decreased the peak values of both g and g the peak values of g and g were respectively 6 82 and 1 30 pa in the fe ii spc treated sample while the corresponding values were 13 46 and 1 85 pa in the control 10 73 and 1 55 pa in the fe ii treated sample and 11 50 and 1 53 pa in the spc treated sample respectively it was documented that a decrease in g value indicated a reduction in colloidal forces and network strength of sludge wang et al 2017 while a decrease in g value reflected a decrement of sludge viscosity zhang et al 2019a to obtain more information fig 3c further shows a frequency sweep at a constant strain of 0 1 it was observed that g value in all the samples was higher than g value within the range of lve regime previous literatures reported that the elastic behavior of sludge dominates its viscous behavior as g g and sludge samples exhibits gelatinous structure liu et al 2016b zhang et al 2019a furthermore the damping factor tanδ reflecting the ratio between viscous and elastic portion of viscoelastic deformation behavior was increased after fe ii spc treatment fig 3c suggesting that this treatment increased the proportion of energy dissipation to energy storage and weakened the gel like structure of was all the results in fig 3 suggested that fe ii spc treatment strengthened flowability but weakened apparent viscosity colloidal forces network strength and gel like structure of was which reduced the resistance of flow and compressive forces during dewatering process shrestha et al 2019 yuan et al 2011 3 4 the effect of fe ii spc treatment on the biological properties of was eps which accounts for 60 80 of sludge flocs and are made up with various of polymers e g proteins polysaccharides humic acids fulvic acid lipids and nucleic acids li and yang 2007 sheng et al 2010 derive from microbial metabolism microorganism lysis or organics absorption from wastewater and keep a dynamically double layer structure namely lb eps and tb eps as crucial structural substances eps prevent cells against dewatering because they glue microbial cells by complex interactions to develop a retiform structure absorbing much moisture sheng et al 2010 it was documented that variations in spatial distribution composition and chemical structure of eps caused changes in physicochemical and rheological properties of sludge which thereby affected its dewatering basuvaraj et al 2015 jin et al 2003 li and yang 2007 wei et al 2018a thus the effect of fe ii spc treatment on eps was evaluated fig 4 a displays the effect of different treatments on doc variation in different eps fractions doc concentration of lb eps tb eps in the control was 120 4 2 5 mg l 345 2 2 9 mg l while the corresponding value reduced to 53 2 3 6 mg l 178 5 4 6 mg l in the fe ii spc treated sample analogous results were also made on the proteins and polysaccharides concentrations in eps fractions as well fig 4b moreover eem spectrum ulteriorly reflected that the amounts of fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances in eps fractions of the fe ii spc treated sample were lower than those in other samples fig 4c all the results indicates that fe ii spc treatment enhanced the disintegration of eps fractions lb eps stretch from the sludge surface to bulk solution and are capable to integrate moisture by their highly multihole but low dense structure for strong affinity between water molecule and organics sheng et al 2010 the disruption of lb eps facilitates the decrement of relative hydrophilicity and bound water content while promoting flocculation settling zhen et al 2018 tb eps are attached to microbial cell and located in the inner sludge thus the bound water in tb eps could release during the disintegration of this eps layer which could also enhance the potential of inner water outflow zhen et al 2018 proteins and polysaccharides contain hydrogen bonds and hydrophilic functional groups which facilitate attachment of water molecule hu et al 2018 neyens et al 2004 the decreases of proteins and polysaccharides in eps usually indicate less stickiness lower hydrophily and better flocculating ability guo et al 2017 additionally it was reported that proteins in eps fractions exert a more significant effect on sludge dewatering than polysaccharides for their higher water containing capacity zhen et al 2018 ftir was further utilized to get more information about the influence of fe ii spc on variations in functional groups of eps fractions the eps fractions contained several functional groups such as stretching vibrations of o h bond in hydroxyl functional related to hydrocarbons stretching and deformation vibrations of c n bond amide i and n h bond amide ii associated with proteins vibration of c c c o c and o h bonds associated with polysaccharides or carbohydrates and ring vibrations of c c and c o h bonds from aromatic amino acids and nucleotides fig 5 a with their specific wavenumber being summarized in table s2 fe ii spc treatment increased the transmittance of all the characteristic peaks reflecting these functional groups indicating decreases of them in eps fractions secondary structure of proteins in eps fractions can be sorted as aggregated strands β sheet α helix 3 turn helix and antiparallel β sheet aggregated strands you et al 2017 fig 5b shows the cd spectra of eps fractions of the control and fe ii spc treated sludge compared with the control shifts of peak location in lb eps and tb eps were observed in the fe ii spc treated sample indicating that fe ii spc treatment exerted influence on the conformation of proteins secondary structure in eps fractions xu et al 2013 to obtain more subtle information about protein secondary structure the amide i band from 1700 to 1600 cm 1 in ftir spectra fig 5a were further characterized by infrared self deconvolution with second derivative resolution and curve fitting fig 5c α helix a right hand helix conformation is hold majorly by the hydrogen bond between the amide hydrogen of peptide bond number n and the carbonyl oxygen of peptide bond number n 4 wu et al 2017a β sheet has a particular structure of the twisted and pleated sheet whereas random coil is other random conformations of no definite structure victorovich et al 2013 wu et al 2017a zhang et al 2019b some researchers reported that low relative content of α helix and ratio of α helix β sheet random coil indicate a loose structure protein molecule you et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b facilitating the exposure of hydrophobic sites in eps proteins the fitting results showed that fe ii spc treatment decreased the percentage of α helix and the value of α helix β sheet random coil from 21 42 and 50 84 to 18 53 and 41 10 in lb eps and 19 94 and 47 24 to 18 53 and 39 48 in tb eps respectively fig 5c these results indicated that fe ii spc treatment possibly affected the hydrogen bonds actions maintaining α helix structure of eps proteins which contributed to protein molecules loosely you et al 2017 apart from hydrogen bond disulfide bond i e sulfuric functional group of the amino acid cysteine could also affect the formation and stabilization of protein secondary structure wu et al 2017a according to the literatures barreca et al 2010 wu et al 2017a s s bond can promote a link of α helix structure by disulfide bridges in cysteine residues moreover s s bond can stabilize a protein tertiary structure when cysteines are part of the same peptide chain and facilitate a quaternary structure of multiunit proteins by forming strong covalent bonds between different peptide chains which in turn may affect protein secondary structure li et al 2020 wu et al 2017a 2016a some scientists suggested that disruption of the disulfide bridges would collapse the concrete framework of proteins leading to secondary structural altering from α helix into β sheet structure wang et al 2016b it was observed that fe ii spc treatment reduced s s group by 18 1 in model protein of eps fig s3 the result indicated the cleavage of s s bond of cysteine residues in protein which contributed to protein molecules loosely as well then the variation in conformations of protein structure induced the reveal of hydrophobic sites and the increase in hydrophobicity of eps fractions fig s4 all the facts demonstrated that fe ii spc treatment changed the conformation of protein secondary structure exposed the hydrophobic sites inside eps protein molecules and therefore elevated the eps hydrophobicity which contributed to increases in surface hydrophobicity and flocculability but a decrease in water holding capacity of was wu et al 2017a you et al 2017 it was also found that fe ii spc treatment increased k and doc concentrations in centrate liquor fig s5 but reduced doc concentration in the intracellular materials fig s6 suggesting that this treatment induced the release of intracellular materials in sludge moreover it was documented that releases of n acetylglucosamine and ldh could be utilized to assess cell wall damage and cytoplasmic membrane permeabilization respectively li et al 2019c in this study fe ii spc treatment obviously facilitated the releases of n acetylglucosamine and ldh figs s7 and s8 demonstrating the severe damage of cell wall and the loss integrity of cytoplasmic membrane in sludge li et al 2019c these results above suggested that fe ii spc facilitated release of intracellular materials by destroying the encapsulating structure of cells in sludge as a consequence the intracellular water was released by this treatment process which was supported by the results shown in fig 2a 3 5 overall understanding of fe ii spc treatment improving sludge dewatering as mentioned before spc could disassociate into na2co3 and h2o2 after mixing with liquid equation 1 when fe ii was added into such liquid under acidic condition fe ii catalyzed h2o2 to form oh while fe ii was oxidized to fe iii concurrently equation 2 this deduction could be supported by fig 6 after 1 h treatment dmpo oh signal in either fe ii or spc added centrate liquid was negligible while the intensity of this signal was very strong in the fe ii spc system fig 6a demonstrating the generation of oh compared with the spc system the fe ii spc system decreased h2o2 concentration whereas this system decreased fe ii concentration but increased fe iii concentration as compared with the fe ii system fig 6b fig 6c further identified the contributions of major intermediates or products in the fe ii spc treatment to the improved dewaterability of was since the presence of na is demonstrated to be unable to enhance sludge dewatering sobeck and higgins 2002 we mainly identified the effects of fe ii fe iii oh and h2o2 on was dewatering in this work it was found that all the fe ii fe iii oh and h2o2 facilitated the dewaterability of was with their contribution being in the sequence of oh fe iii h2o2 fe ii fig 6c among them oh and fe iii were the major contributors responsible for the improved dewaterability of was fig 6c it was documented that oxidative oh could damage and denature sludge eps ingredients e g polysaccharides proteins and various biopolymers cytoplasmic membrane and intracellular components such as lipids dna rna and other biomacromolecules wu et al 2017a yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 fe iii was an effective coagulant for sludge flocs through reducing electronegativity and water affinity surface areas of sludge flocs yu et al 2016 according to the analyses above an isochronous process of oxidation and re flocculation i e destruction of was by oh oxidation and re flocculation of disrupted was by fe iii was thus proposed to unveil how fe ii spc treatment facilitated was dewatering fig 7 in the oxidation step oh was produced by fe ii catalyzing h2o2 derived from spc disassociation then the oxidative oh collapsed and fragmented eps compounds e g proteins and polysaccharides and further induced cytoderm damage and cytoplasmic membrane permeabilization which promoted the releases of both eps bound and intracellular water furthermore oh transformed the secondary structure of eps proteins via both affecting the hydrogen bond maintaining α helix and destroying disulfide bond in cysteines which caused the exposure of hydrophobic sites in eps proteins reinforcing eps hydrophobicity in the re flocculation step fe iii the oxidation product of fe ii agglomerated the small disrupted sludge particles into larger particles and decreased the hydrophilicity of sludge after reducing electronegativity and water affinity surface areas of sludge overall the modified eps properties and cell physiological status of sludge by fe ii spc treatment further changed the rheological behavior and improved physicochemical properties of sludge as a result the bound water release flocculability hydrophobicity drain capability and flowability of sludge were strengthened but the compact surface structure colloidal force network strength gel like structure and apparent viscosity of sludge were weakened which eventually drove its dewatering 3 6 implications of fe ii spc treatment in this study a novel fe ii spc treatment was developed to improve was dewatering and the related mechanisms was unveiled for the first time it was found that fe ii spc treatment could greatly enhance the dewaterability of was without introducing any potentially harmful by products into the environment as press filtration was employed 55 6 of wcsc was determined with treatment by 20 mg g tss fe ii and 50 mg g tss spc at ph 3 this data is comparable to that treated by the prevalent fe ii persulfate process shi et al 2015 shi and his co workers demonstrated that 55 8 of wcsc by press filtration was measured under the addition of 23 5 mg g tss fe ii and 100 mg g tss persulfate shi et al 2015 moreover spc is much cheaper than persulfate 560 t for spc vs 1100 t for persulfate and the required dosage of spc is half that of persulfate shi et al 2015 therefore this technique is environment friendly and economically attractive for practical applications besides this fe ii spc based technology is beneficial for the final disposal of dewatered was sludge disposal generally consists of land improvement agricultural utilization landfill and incineration li et al 2019b among them land application e g agricultural utilization is regarded as the preferable method according to the council directive 86 278 eec for sludge treatment li et al 2019b nevertheless land application of sludge is always limited by the presence of toxic contaminants such as pathogens and refractory organic matters li et al 2019b it was observed that fe ii spc treatment reduced the population of fecal coliform in the dewatered sludge cake with the number being below the class a requirement of the us standards for class a biosolids fig s9a namely 3 log mpn g tss li et al 2019b indicating that this treatment has a potential in inactivating fecal coliform in addition this treatment decreased humic acid content in sludge from 123 5 2 3 mg g tss the control to 101 2 3 3 mg g tss fig s9b suggesting that the content of refractory organic matters contained in dewatered sludge decreased after fe ii spc treatment it should be pointed that this work principally aimed to develop a promising fe ii spc treatment for enhancing was dewaterability and reveal the relevant mechanism thus technical optimization was not conducted thus the comprehensive optimization research is needed in the future on the basis of the optimization research scaling up this fe ii spc treated technique to full scale levels is also necessary to evaluate its technical and economic feasibilities under the actual situation 4 conclusion we for the first time exploited fe ii spc treatment to dewater was and revealed the relevant dewatering mechanism the main conclusions in this study were as below after conditioned by 20 mg g tss fe ii and 50 mg g tss spc the wcsc by press filtration was merely 55 6 1 4 which was 35 6 lower than that in the control the mechanism explorations revealed that oh and fe iii species were the two main contributors to the enhanced sludge dewaterability oh induced not merely the collapse and fragmentization of extracellular polymeric substances but also the lesion of cytoderm and permeabilization of cytomembrane which drove the releases of both eps bound and intracellular water moreover oh caused the conversion of the extracellular proteins secondary structure through both influencing the h bond actions keeping α helix and destroying s s bond in cysteine residues which intensified the hydrophobicity of eps additionally fe iii species the oxidized products of fe ii resulted in decrements in negative charge and water affinity surface areas of was which promoted the agglomeration and hydrophobicity of was therefore the bound water release flocculability surface hydrophobicity drain capability and flowability of was were intensified while the compact surface structure colloidal force network strength gel like structure and apparent viscosity of was were alleviated after fe ii spc treatment the recalcitrant organics and fecal coliforms in sludge were lessened by fe ii spc treatment benefiting the land utilization of dewatered sludge cake declaration of competing interest the

18058,in this work fe ii catalyzing sodium percarbonate fe ii spc was managed to facilitate waste activated sludge was dewatering for the first time the results showed that after was was treated by 20

55 6 1 4 and 30 1 2 5 s respectively the mechanism investigations indicated that four intermediates or products i e oh h2o2 fe ii and fe iii generated in the fe ii spc process were responsible for the improved was dewaterability and oh and fe iii were the two major contributors it was found that oh collapsed and fragmented extracellular polymeric substances damaged cell wall and permeabilized cytoplasmic membrane and transformed conformation of the extracellular proteins secondary structure via both affecting the hydrogen bond maintaining α helix and cracking disulfide bond in cysteine residues while fe iii the oxidization product of fe ii decreased the surface electronegativity and water affinity surface areas of was flocs as a result the bound water release flocculability surface hydrophobicity drain capability and flowability of was flocs were strengthened whereas the compact surface structure colloidal forces network strength gel like structure and apparent viscosity of was flocs were weakened in addition fe ii spc process also reduced the recalcitrant organics and fecal coliforms in sludge which facilitated land application of dewatered sludge the findings acquired in

2020 wu et al 2019a xu et al 2019 zhang and chen 2020 the management of was is an important part of wwtps which accounts for 30 60 of the total operating cost of a wwtp luo et al 2020 wang et al 2018c the improvement in was dewatering is effective to cut the costs of sludge treatment transportation and subsequent disposal wei et al 2018a hence substantial efforts were made to develop the techniques for sludge dewatering in the past years feng et al 2009 li et al 2019d masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 na et al 2007 wang et al 2018b wu et al 2016b multiple approaches such as electrolysis ultrasonic skeleton materials flocculants coagulants and chemical oxidation processes were attempted to enhance was dewatering feng et al 2009 masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 na et al 2007 wang et al 2018b wu et al 2016b among them chemical oxidation coagulation process has attracted increasing attention in such a scheme chemical oxidants such as oxone sodium hypochlorite naclo and potassium permanganate kmno4 were first used to oxidize was flocs and then coagulants e g fe iii were employed to agglomerate the preoxidized was flocs lv et al 2019 wei et al 2019 wu et al 2017b although this chemical oxidation coagulation process was demonstrated to be effective its practical application was limited by the expensive price the potential risk in formation of halogenated organics or the increased colourity of dewatering filtrate sun et al 2018 wu et al 2017b yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b sodium percarbonate spc na2co3 1 5h2o2 is an effective relatively inexpensive and environment friendly oxidant when spc enters into water it can disassociate to na2co3 and h2o2 equation 1 which therefore exhibit a certain level of oxidizability fu et al 2015 the oxidizability would amplify in the presence of fe ii under acidic ambient as the strong oxidizing and nonselective hydroxyl radicals oh would be produced during fe ii catalyzing spc fe ii spc process via equation 2 fu et al 2015 due to this property fe ii spc process has been growingly employed in the remediation of groundwater or surface water and soil polluted by organic pollutants recently fu et al 2015 wang et al 2018a yan et al 2018 for instance fu and his co workers found that more than 95 of benzene 1 mm was degraded by fe ii spc at ph 3 for 20 min treatment fu et al 2015 the property and previous investigations enlighten us to raise such a hypothesis that fe ii spc treatment might be effective in promoting was dewaterability as a solid precursor of oh spc is not only convenient to handle at real world situations but also safe in the transportation and storage processes zhang et al 2018 moreover the price of spc is about 560 t which is lower than that of several common oxidants such as oxone 1300 t and permanganate 1881 t fu et al 2015 guo et al 2017 shi et al 2015 the added fe ii salt which is cheaper than fe iii salt 160 t for fe iii vs 80 t for fe ii li et al 2016 wei et al 2018b yu et al 2016 has dual functions i e as a catalyst to initiate the fenton reaction in fe ii spc process and as a coagulant in was dewatering process in addition no toxic intermediates or products were produced in this process equations 1 and 2 thus fe ii spc treatment will be economically attractive and environment friendly for practical applications if it is proven to be effective to date however no

physiochemical rheological extracellular polymeric substances eps characteristics and cell physiological status of was thirdly the potential contributions of oh h2o2 fe ii and fe iii to the improved dewaterability treatment were identified finally the effects of fe ii spc treatment on the contents of recalcitrant organics and fecal coliforms in dewatered was were examined the work demonstrated for the first time that fe ii spc treatment improved was dewaterability and uncovered the underlying mechanism the findings acquired not only deepens our understanding of fe ii spc involved was

2017 2 5 statistical analysis all the tests were performed in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of results with the software spss 22 0 and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 the dewaterability of was after fe ii spc treatment fig 1 shows the was dewaterability after treatment by various dosages of fe ii catalyzed spc it was found that individual fe ii or spc treatment did not obviously elevate was dewaterability for instance after was was treated by individual fe ii 0 20 mg g tss or spc 0 100 mg g tss no significant variation was observed in values of cst or wcsc vacuum filtration however after was was treated by the combination of spc and fe ii was dewaterability was greatly improved after an increment of spc addition from 0 to 100 mg g tss the value of cst decreased from 94 2 3 2 to 60 1 1 9 s in f2 group i e in the presence of 2 mg g tss fe ii 93 3 2 4 to 46 8 2 5 s in f10 group and 91 7 3 1 to 30 1 2 5 s in f20 group fig 1a similar tendency was also observed on wcsc by vacuum filtration fig 1b the results suggested that 20 mg g tss fe ii and 50 mg g tss spc were the optimum dosages with 32 9 2 1 s of cst and 68 1 0 7 of wcsc by vacuum filtration being measured respectively moreover 55 6 1 4 of wcsc after press filtration was determined in this scenario while 37 2 kg of the mass of dewatering filtrate was measured fig 1c and d clearly fe ii spc treatment significantly improved was dewatering and solid content of sludge cake in the following text the mechanism of how fe ii spc treatment affects the dewaterability of was was explored 3 2 the effect of fe ii spc treatment on physicochemical properties of was the performance of sludge dewatering is closely related to several crucial physicochemical properties of sludge such as bound water floc size fractal dimension hydrophobicity zeta potential and microstructure jin et al 2003 li et al 2019f li and yang 2007 liu et al 2016a wilén et al 2003 zhen et al 2012b thus we first assessed how fe ii spc treatment affects these key physicochemical properties water contained in sludge is generally categorized into two types i e free water and bound water under mechanical force the former is easily drainable while the latter is hard to be dehydrated for it is tightly bound to eps or other ingredients of sludge cai et al 2018 guo et al 2017 therefore bound water is one of the key factors related to sludge dewatering cai et al 2018 guo et al 2017 fig 2 a shows the change in total bound water eps bound water and intracellular water of was samples by different treatments the bound water content in the fe ii spc treated sample was less than that in either the control or the sample treated by sole fe ii or spc for example 1 60 0 04 g g tss of total bound water was measured in the fe ii spc treated sample while the corresponding value was 1 95 0 06 g g tss in the control 1 85 0 04 g g tss in the fe ii treated sample and 1 88 0 03 g g tss in the spc treated sample fig 2a similar observations were also made on the variations in eps bound water and intracellular water fig 2a the results indicated that fe ii spc treatment reduced eps bound and intracellular water in was which accelerated the conversion of bound water to free water in sludge and therefore enhanced the amount of drainable water fig 1d fig 2b displays the variations in particle size d0 5 of sludge by different treatments compared with the control or sole treatments fe ii spc treatment elevated the particle size of sludge the particle size was 51 5 0 3 μm in the control 53 0 0 4 μm in the fe ii treated sludge and 51 3 0 5 μm in the spc treated sludge while the corresponding data was 54 6 0 4 μm in the fe ii spc treated sludge previous literature reported that an increment of particle size lessens the exposure of sludge surface and thereby averts the small sludge particles from sealing filter medium and cake layer during filtration zhen et al 2012b fractal dimension is an indicator reflecting the morphology of sludge flocs and an increment of fractal dimension suggests an enhancement of compactness and denseness in surface structure dai et al 2018 after fe ii spc treatment fractal dimension of was decreased from 2 11 0 004 to 2 03 0 01 indicating the reduction in compact structure of sludge fig 2b these results suggested that after fe ii spc treatment was flocs became larger and looser than their status in the control which promoted the passage of water during compression stage bian et al 2018 it was ulteriorly found that fe ii spc treatment increased the contact angle of sludge from 95 1 to 131 3 fig 2c which suggests an enhancement in hydrophobicity of was after fe ii spc treatment previous reference documented that sludge flocculability was primarily affected by hydrophobic interactions electrostatic interactions and polymer bridging wilén et al 2003 the improvement of hydrophobicity contributes to the decrease of water binding and facilitate the agglomeration of sludge li et al 2019b zeta potential is an important factor in sludge aggregating or dispersing li et al 2019b it was found that the zeta potential was 11 2 0 8 mv in the control 8 5 0 7 mv in the fe ii treated was and 10 8 0 5 mv in the spc treated was fig 2d after was was treated by fe ii spc this value increased to 4 3 0 6 mv fig 2d it is known that a reduction of negative charge reflects a decrease in electrostatic repulsive interactions benefiting sludge particle collision destabilization and flocculation setting liu et al 2016a previous studies also reported that the dewatering performance improved when the absolute value of sludge zeta potential decreased li et al 2016 which was consistent with the results obtained in fig 2d fig 2e shows microtopography differences observed in the sludge with or without fe ii spc treatment the surface of sludge cake without treatment i e the control was highly coarse but compact and condensed without large openings which prevented the inner layer water from expelling however after fe ii spc treatment a flake shaped and or block shaped structure with notable cracks pores was formed in the was surface which was covered with plentiful iron species the porosity structure could weaken the storage capacity for water molecules held in the tiny pores of sludge dai et al 2018 rao et al 2019 and these channels could serve as drainage for the water outflow dai et al 2018 rao et al 2019 moreover sludge volumes in the fe ii spc treated sample were bigger than those in the control which accorded with the results of particle size shown in fig 2b the results suggested that fe ii spc treatment induced the formation of internal channels with large pores which thereby promoted the discharge of water 3 3 the effect of fe ii spc treatment on rheological properties of was rheology is a useful tool for studying the deformation and flow of the materials such as sludge suspension wang et al 2016a it is reported that sludge rheological behavior is also related to sludge dewaterability liu et al 2016a therefore we assessed the effect of fe ii spc treatment on the rheological properties of was as well in the literature wang et al 2017 viscous viscoplastic properties and viscoelastic properties were investigated by a rotational rheometer under steady shear test and dynamic measurement respectively it can be seen from fig 3 a that under the steady shear test the flow curves of all the was samples conformed to the herschel bulkley equation fig 3a based on the calculations according to the herschel bulkley model equation s 2 it was found that fe ii spc treatment elevated the flow behavior index n but decreased the consistency of sludge k fig 3a an increment of n indicates that sludge was transformed toward a newtonian fluids with increased fluidity while a decrement of k value suggests the decreased apparent viscosity li et al 2019b xiao et al 2017 several investigators showed that the diminution of apparent viscosity was mainly attributed to the disorganization of sludge colloids yuan et al 2011 the results reflected that fe ii spc treatment reduced the apparent viscosity but elevated the flowability probably due to the destruction of inner structure of sludge colloids kept by net like eps matrix also from fig 3a it can be observed that the values of shear stress on the descending path in all the scenarios were lower than those on the ascending path which thereby formed a hysteresis loop between the two paths the hysteresis loop area can be employed to indicate the extent of thixotropic behavior of the sludge which reflects the breakdown and build up processes in internal structures of sludge by measuring the area of the loop wu et al 2019b and strong thixotropy of sludge suggests strong colloidal forces among sludge particles which tend to rebuild the structures zhang et al 2019a according to the calculations the hysteresis loop area of the fe ii spc treated sludge was 345 6 pa s 1 which was lower than that of other samples 488 3 pa s 1 in the control 385 5 pa s 1 in the fe ii treated sample and 412 1 pa s 1 treated in the spc treated sample reflecting that fe ii spc treated sample reached steady status faster than other samples the result suggested that fe ii spc treatment efficaciously weakened the colloidal forces which was further confirmed in fig 3b as shown in fig 3b all the relative pairs of curves presented analogous development of the storage modulus g and loss modulus g under the dynamic measurement mode a linear viscoelastic lve region was seen at low strain about γ 0 5 in which g and g maintained almost constant fe ii spc treatment decreased the peak values of both g and g the peak values of g and g were respectively 6 82 and 1 30 pa in the fe ii spc treated sample while the corresponding values were 13 46 and 1 85 pa in the control 10 73 and 1 55 pa in the fe ii treated sample and 11 50 and 1 53 pa in the spc treated sample respectively it was documented that a decrease in g value indicated a reduction in colloidal forces and network strength of sludge wang et al 2017 while a decrease in g value reflected a decrement of sludge viscosity zhang et al 2019a to obtain more information fig 3c further shows a frequency sweep at a constant strain of 0 1 it was observed that g value in all the samples was higher than g value within the range of lve regime previous literatures reported that the elastic behavior of sludge dominates its viscous behavior as g g and sludge samples exhibits gelatinous structure liu et al 2016b zhang et al 2019a furthermore the damping factor tanδ reflecting the ratio between viscous and elastic portion of viscoelastic deformation behavior was increased after fe ii spc treatment fig 3c suggesting that this treatment increased the proportion of energy dissipation to energy storage and weakened the gel like structure of was all the results in fig 3 suggested that fe ii spc treatment strengthened flowability but weakened apparent viscosity colloidal forces network strength and gel like structure of was which reduced the resistance of flow and compressive forces during dewatering process shrestha et al 2019 yuan et al 2011 3 4 the effect of fe ii spc treatment on the biological properties of was eps which accounts for 60 80 of sludge flocs and are made up with various of polymers e g proteins polysaccharides humic acids fulvic acid lipids and nucleic acids li and yang 2007 sheng et al 2010 derive from microbial metabolism microorganism lysis or organics absorption from wastewater and keep a dynamically double layer structure namely lb eps and tb eps as crucial structural substances eps prevent cells against dewatering because they glue microbial cells by complex interactions to develop a retiform structure absorbing much moisture sheng et al 2010 it was documented that variations in spatial distribution composition and chemical structure of eps caused changes in physicochemical and rheological properties of sludge which thereby affected its dewatering basuvaraj et al 2015 jin et al 2003 li and yang 2007 wei et al 2018a thus the effect of fe ii spc treatment on eps was evaluated fig 4 a displays the effect of different treatments on doc variation in different eps fractions doc concentration of lb eps tb eps in the control was 120 4 2 5 mg l 345 2 2 9 mg l while the corresponding value reduced to 53 2 3 6 mg l 178 5 4 6 mg l in the fe ii spc treated sample analogous results were also made on the proteins and polysaccharides concentrations in eps fractions as well fig 4b moreover eem spectrum ulteriorly reflected that the amounts of fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances in eps fractions of the fe ii spc treated sample were lower than those in other samples fig 4c all the results indicates that fe ii spc treatment enhanced the disintegration of eps fractions lb eps stretch from the sludge surface to bulk solution and are capable to integrate moisture by their highly multihole but low dense structure for strong affinity between water molecule and organics sheng et al 2010 the disruption of lb eps facilitates the decrement of relative hydrophilicity and bound water content while promoting flocculation settling zhen et al 2018 tb eps are attached to microbial cell and located in the inner sludge thus the bound water in tb eps could release during the disintegration of this eps layer which could also enhance the potential of inner water outflow zhen et al 2018 proteins and polysaccharides contain hydrogen bonds and hydrophilic functional groups which facilitate attachment of water molecule hu et al 2018 neyens et al 2004 the decreases of proteins and polysaccharides in eps usually indicate less stickiness lower hydrophily and better flocculating ability guo et al 2017 additionally it was reported that proteins in eps fractions exert a more significant effect on sludge dewatering than polysaccharides for their higher water containing capacity zhen et al 2018 ftir was further utilized to get more information about the influence of fe ii spc on variations in functional groups of eps fractions the eps fractions contained several functional groups such as stretching vibrations of o h bond in hydroxyl functional related to hydrocarbons stretching and deformation vibrations of c n bond amide i and n h bond amide ii associated with proteins vibration of c c c o c and o h bonds associated with polysaccharides or carbohydrates and ring vibrations of c c and c o h bonds from aromatic amino acids and nucleotides fig 5 a with their specific wavenumber being summarized in table s2 fe ii spc treatment increased the transmittance of all the characteristic peaks reflecting these functional groups indicating decreases of them in eps fractions secondary structure of proteins in eps fractions can be sorted as aggregated strands β sheet α helix 3 turn helix and antiparallel β sheet aggregated strands you et al 2017 fig 5b shows the cd spectra of eps fractions of the control and fe ii spc treated sludge compared with the control shifts of peak location in lb eps and tb eps were observed in the fe ii spc treated sample indicating that fe ii spc treatment exerted influence on the conformation of proteins secondary structure in eps fractions xu et al 2013 to obtain more subtle information about protein secondary structure the amide i band from 1700 to 1600 cm 1 in ftir spectra fig 5a were further characterized by infrared self deconvolution with second derivative resolution and curve fitting fig 5c α helix a right hand helix conformation is hold majorly by the hydrogen bond between the amide hydrogen of peptide bond number n and the carbonyl oxygen of peptide bond number n 4 wu et al 2017a β sheet has a particular structure of the twisted and pleated sheet whereas random coil is other random conformations of no definite structure victorovich et al 2013 wu et al 2017a zhang et al 2019b some researchers reported that low relative content of α helix and ratio of α helix β sheet random coil indicate a loose structure protein molecule you et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b facilitating the exposure of hydrophobic sites in eps proteins the fitting results showed that fe ii spc treatment decreased the percentage of α helix and the value of α helix β sheet random coil from 21 42 and 50 84 to 18 53 and 41 10 in lb eps and 19 94 and 47 24 to 18 53 and 39 48 in tb eps respectively fig 5c these results indicated that fe ii spc treatment possibly affected the hydrogen bonds actions maintaining α helix structure of eps proteins which contributed to protein molecules loosely you et al 2017 apart from hydrogen bond disulfide bond i e sulfuric functional group of the amino acid cysteine could also affect the formation and stabilization of protein secondary structure wu et al 2017a according to the literatures barreca et al 2010 wu et al 2017a s s bond can promote a link of α helix structure by disulfide bridges in cysteine residues moreover s s bond can stabilize a protein tertiary structure when cysteines are part of the same peptide chain and facilitate a quaternary structure of multiunit proteins by forming strong covalent bonds between different peptide chains which in turn may affect protein secondary structure li et al 2020 wu et al 2017a 2016a some scientists suggested that disruption of the disulfide bridges would collapse the concrete framework of proteins leading to secondary structural altering from α helix into β sheet structure wang et al 2016b it was observed that fe ii spc treatment reduced s s group by 18 1 in model protein of eps fig s3 the result indicated the cleavage of s s bond of cysteine residues in protein which contributed to protein molecules loosely as well then the variation in conformations of protein structure induced the reveal of hydrophobic sites and the increase in hydrophobicity of eps fractions fig s4 all the facts demonstrated that fe ii spc treatment changed the conformation of protein secondary structure exposed the hydrophobic sites inside eps protein molecules and therefore elevated the eps hydrophobicity which contributed to increases in surface hydrophobicity and flocculability but a decrease in water holding capacity of was wu et al 2017a you et al 2017 it was also found that fe ii spc treatment increased k and doc concentrations in centrate liquor fig s5 but reduced doc concentration in the intracellular materials fig s6 suggesting that this treatment induced the release of intracellular materials in sludge moreover it was documented that releases of n acetylglucosamine and ldh could be utilized to assess cell wall damage and cytoplasmic membrane permeabilization respectively li et al 2019c in this study fe ii spc treatment obviously facilitated the releases of n acetylglucosamine and ldh figs s7 and s8 demonstrating the severe damage of cell wall and the loss integrity of cytoplasmic membrane in sludge li et al 2019c these results above suggested that fe ii spc facilitated release of intracellular materials by destroying the encapsulating structure of cells in sludge as a consequence the intracellular water was released by this treatment process which was supported by the results shown in fig 2a 3 5 overall understanding of fe ii spc treatment improving sludge dewatering as mentioned before spc could disassociate into na2co3 and h2o2 after mixing with liquid equation 1 when fe ii was added into such liquid under acidic condition fe ii catalyzed h2o2 to form oh while fe ii was oxidized to fe iii concurrently equation 2 this deduction could be supported by fig 6 after 1 h treatment dmpo oh signal in either fe ii or spc added centrate liquid was negligible while the intensity of this signal was very strong in the fe ii spc system fig 6a demonstrating the generation of oh compared with the spc system the fe ii spc system decreased h2o2 concentration whereas this system decreased fe ii concentration but increased fe iii concentration as compared with the fe ii system fig 6b fig 6c further identified the contributions of major intermediates or products in the fe ii spc treatment to the improved dewaterability of was since the presence of na is demonstrated to be unable to enhance sludge dewatering sobeck and higgins 2002 we mainly identified the effects of fe ii fe iii oh and h2o2 on was dewatering in this work it was found that all the fe ii fe iii oh and h2o2 facilitated the dewaterability of was with their contribution being in the sequence of oh fe iii h2o2 fe ii fig 6c among them oh and fe iii were the major contributors responsible for the improved dewaterability of was fig 6c it was documented that oxidative oh could damage and denature sludge eps ingredients e g polysaccharides proteins and various biopolymers cytoplasmic membrane and intracellular components such as lipids dna rna and other biomacromolecules wu et al 2017a yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 fe iii was an effective coagulant for sludge flocs through reducing electronegativity and water affinity surface areas of sludge flocs yu et al 2016 according to the analyses above an isochronous process of oxidation and re flocculation i e destruction of was by oh oxidation and re flocculation of disrupted was by fe iii was thus proposed to unveil how fe ii spc treatment facilitated was dewatering fig 7 in the oxidation step oh was produced by fe ii catalyzing h2o2 derived from spc disassociation then the oxidative oh collapsed and fragmented eps compounds e g proteins and polysaccharides and further induced cytoderm damage and cytoplasmic membrane permeabilization which promoted the releases of both eps bound and intracellular water furthermore oh transformed the secondary structure of eps proteins via both affecting the hydrogen bond maintaining α helix and destroying disulfide bond in cysteines which caused the exposure of hydrophobic sites in eps proteins reinforcing eps hydrophobicity in the re flocculation step fe iii the oxidation product of fe ii agglomerated the small disrupted sludge particles into larger particles and decreased the hydrophilicity of sludge after reducing electronegativity and water affinity surface areas of sludge overall the modified eps properties and cell physiological status of sludge by fe ii spc treatment further changed the rheological behavior and improved physicochemical properties of sludge as a result the bound water release flocculability hydrophobicity drain capability and flowability of sludge were strengthened but the compact surface structure colloidal force network strength gel like structure and apparent viscosity of sludge were weakened which eventually drove its dewatering 3 6 implications of fe ii spc treatment in this study a novel fe ii spc treatment was developed to improve was dewatering and the related mechanisms was unveiled for the first time it was found that fe ii spc treatment could greatly enhance the dewaterability of was without introducing any potentially harmful by products into the environment as press filtration was employed 55 6 of wcsc was determined with treatment by 20 mg g tss fe ii and 50 mg g tss spc at ph 3 this data is comparable to that treated by the prevalent fe ii persulfate process shi et al 2015 shi and his co workers demonstrated that 55 8 of wcsc by press filtration was measured under the addition of 23 5 mg g tss fe ii and 100 mg g tss persulfate shi et al 2015 moreover spc is much cheaper than persulfate 560 t for spc vs 1100 t for persulfate and the required dosage of spc is half that of persulfate shi et al 2015 therefore this technique is environment friendly and economically attractive for practical applications besides this fe ii spc based technology is beneficial for the final disposal of dewatered was sludge disposal generally consists of land improvement agricultural utilization landfill and incineration li et al 2019b among them land application e g agricultural utilization is regarded as the preferable method according to the council directive 86 278 eec for sludge treatment li et al 2019b nevertheless land application of sludge is always limited by the presence of toxic contaminants such as pathogens and refractory organic matters li et al 2019b it was observed that fe ii spc treatment reduced the population of fecal coliform in the dewatered sludge cake with the number being below the class a requirement of the us standards for class a biosolids fig s9a namely 3 log mpn g tss li et al 2019b indicating that this treatment has a potential in inactivating fecal coliform in addition this treatment decreased humic acid content in sludge from 123 5 2 3 mg g tss the control to 101 2 3 3 mg g tss fig s9b suggesting that the content of refractory organic matters contained in dewatered sludge decreased after fe ii spc treatment it should be pointed that this work principally aimed to develop a promising fe ii spc treatment for enhancing was dewaterability and reveal the relevant mechanism thus technical optimization was not conducted thus the comprehensive optimization research is needed in the future on the basis of the optimization research scaling up this fe ii spc treated technique to full scale levels is also necessary to evaluate its technical and economic feasibilities under the actual situation 4 conclusion we for the first time exploited fe ii spc treatment to dewater was and revealed the relevant dewatering mechanism the main conclusions in this study were as below after conditioned by 20 mg g tss fe ii and 50 mg g tss spc the wcsc by press filtration was merely 55 6 1 4 which was 35 6 lower than that in the control the mechanism explorations revealed that oh and fe iii species were the two main contributors to the enhanced sludge dewaterability oh induced not merely the collapse and fragmentization of extracellular polymeric substances but also the lesion of cytoderm and permeabilization of cytomembrane which drove the releases of both eps bound and intracellular water moreover oh caused the conversion of the extracellular proteins secondary structure through both influencing the h bond actions keeping α helix and destroying s s bond in cysteine residues which intensified the hydrophobicity of eps additionally fe iii species the oxidized products of fe ii resulted in decrements in negative charge and water affinity surface areas of was which promoted the agglomeration and hydrophobicity of was therefore the bound water release flocculability surface hydrophobicity drain capability and flowability of was were intensified while the compact surface structure colloidal force network strength gel like structure and apparent viscosity of was were alleviated after fe ii spc treatment the recalcitrant organics and fecal coliforms in sludge were lessened by fe ii spc treatment benefiting the land utilization of dewatered sludge cake declaration of competing interest the

18059,ketamine ket and methamphetamine meth have been recognized as emerging contaminants in aquatic ecosystems this paper aimed to investigate the environmental behaviour including the degradation distribution and bioaccumulation of meth ket and their main metabolites amphetamine amp and norketamine norket the changes in acute toxicity in the aqueous phase and in the bacterial community in sediment were determined to assess the associated eco risk of the drug exposure five types of lab scale aquatic ecosystems were established and exposed to ket or meth for 40 days a water sediment organisms ket system k a water sediment organisms meth system m a water sediment organism meth ket system m k a water sediment ket meth system control and a water sediment organisms system biocontrol the results demonstrated that much faster degradation occurred for both meth t1 2 3 89 and 2 37 days in the m and m k group respectively and ket t1 2 5 69 days 5 39 days in the k group and m k group respectively than in the control group t1 2 7 83 and 86 71days for meth and ket respectively rapid adsorption of ket meth and their metabolites was observed in the sediment which had clay and silt as the main particle sizes ket was observed to be absorbed by shallow water fish chinese medaka rosy bitterling and mosquito fish while meth was dominantly ingested by bottom dwellers loach duckweed might play a crucial role in the dissipation process of meth and ket which were mainly adsorbed by duckweed roots during incubation the acute toxic levels in the k and m k groups changed from non toxic to medium toxicity levels and the toxicity in the m and control groups changed from non toxic to low toxicity levels moreover marked changes in the bacterial community in the sediment induced by meth or ket exposure were observed and the most significant change in the bacterial community was observed in the group spiked with both meth and ket this work for the first time elucidated the environmental behaviors of meth and ket in aquatic ecosystem and associated the impact on ecological system equilibrium graphical abstract image 1 keywords psychoactive drugs lab scale ecosystem

use of these two drugs an increasing number of people have consumed them recreationally attracted to their psychotropic effects which has resulted in widespread occurrence of ket and meth in surface water systems originating from the effluents of municipal hospital and domestic wastewater plants du et al 2015 jiang et al 2015 lin et al 2010 notably in china ket and meth were observed at

and biological activities could maintain when released into aquatic environment heberer 2002 thus the potential health risks and toxicity posed by the two drugs on aquatic organisms should not be overlooked previous investigations found that physiological biochemical and behavioural consequences were associated with ket and meth exposure in several aquatic organisms for example significant

was examined using a sunlight simulation reactor and the half life was 12 6 h lin et al 2014 our previous work documented that the two drugs may be refractory in river systems using a microcosm model since the half lives of meth and ket were greater than 60 days in aqueous phase and more than 100 days in sediment wang et al 2018 nevertheless there is limited information on the environmental behaviour of the two drugs in complex aquatic systems lab scale aquatic ecosystems microcosms which simulate the physical and chemical conditions of natural systems have been widely used to

significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 distribution and degradation of chemicals in water and sediment as shown in fig 1 the degradation of meth and ket in the aqueous phase was observed in all ecosystems the half lives of meth in the m m k and control groups were approximately 3 89 2 37 and 7 83 days respectively moreover over 99 of meth was decomposed in both the m and m k groups while the degradation rate in the control group was approximately 77 9 at the end of the incubation period fig 1 a the degradation of ket in the control group was approximately 28 7 after the 40 day incubation period and the concentration was close to constant after day 20 while the residual concentration of ket significantly decreased over 80 after the 40 day incubation period in the k and m k treatments the t1 2 of ket in the k and m k groups was 5 69 and 5 39 days respectively which were comparatively lower that that 86 71 days in the control group fig 1 c as shown in fig 1 b and fig 1 d rapid distribution of both meth and ket in all treatments was observed in the sediment the concentrations of the two drugs in sediment initially increased and then decreased gradually in the experimental groups the maximum concentrations of meth in the m and m k treatments were 16 1 on day 6 and 12 4 on day 10 ng g 1 respectively the highest level of ket in the k group was 53 4 ng g 1 on day 15 and in the m k group it was 98 6 ng g 1 on day 10 in the control group the level of meth peaked on day 10 26 8 ng g 1 while that of ket peaked on day 20 123 2 ng g 1 the highest concentrations of the two drugs in sediments in the bio groups were notably lower than those in the control group which corresponded to different levels in the aqueous phase between the experimental groups and the control the highest concentration of meth occurred in the m group prior to that in the m k group while the maximum ket concentration in the k group was later during the incubation period than in the m k group indicating that there may be competitive adsorption between the two drugs the sediment may be an accumulation site of ket in the aquatic system since the level of ket was close to constant during the total exposure period of 40 days fig 1 d amphetamine amp a major metabolite of meth was detected in the water from the m and m k groups only on day 3 and the concentrations were 0 075 and 0 055 ng ml

et al 2018 the increase of norketamine norket the main metabolite of ket was observed in both the water and sediment from the k and m k ecosystems the highest concentrations in the water were 5 4 ng ml 1 in the k group and 5 1 ng ml 1 in the m k group in sediment the maximum concentrations were 10 9 ng g 1 and 10 3 ng g 1 in the k and m k treatments respectively fig 1 c and d in the control group norket was only detected in water after day 20 and the highest level of 0 4 ng ml 1 was observed on day 40 fig 1 c the results showed that norket in aquatic ecosystems may be mainly released through organismal metabolism and may possibly be accumulated in the sediments 3 2 distribution and degradation of chemicals in organisms as shown in fig 2 a rapid distribution of meth was observed on the 3rd day in all fish but the concentration was far lower than in the water phase except for in the loach the highest meth levels in medaka bitterling fish and mosquito fish were 5 7 8 6 and 2 2 ng g 1 in the m treatment and 4 9 12 6 and 2 6 ng g 1 in the m k treatment respectively fig 2 a c and d the meth concentration in loach fish peaked on the 15th day in both the m and m k ecosystems and the concentrations detected were 39 6 ng g 1 in the m group and 32 8 ng g 1 in the m k group fig 2 b moreover the accumulation of amp was found in all fish and the concentration increased first and then declined with incubation time fig 2 shows that the maximum concentrations of amp in medaka loach bitterling fish and mosquito fish were 49 3 23 8 49 0 and 17 1 ng g 1 respectively on the 10th day in the m group while the maximum amp concentrations in the loach and mosquito fish were observed on the 6th day and in medaka and bitterling fish on the 10th day in the m k group and the values were close to those observed in the m group fig 3 shows the changes in the ket and norket concentrations in different fish types and their levels showed an n shaped curve in the m k group in all fish except in the bitterling fish the maximum concentrations of ket in medaka loach bitterling and mosquito fish were 99 7 37 1 60 4 and 67 0 ng g 1 while the levels of norket were 46 3 6 8 20 5 and 36 5 ng g 1 respectively in the k treatment group the ket concentration in medaka bitterling fish and mosquito fish steadily increased during the incubation period and the levels on the 40th day were 85 7 55 4 and 83 8 ng g 1 respectively fig 3 a and d the highest concentration in loach was 36 6 ng g 1 on day 20 fig 3 b moreover the change in norket concentrations in the k group in all fish corresponded with the changes in ket concentrations the results showed that norket detected in bio ecosystems may be mainly excreted by aquatic organisms as shown in fig 4 significant bioaccumulation of meth and ket in duckweed was observed in this work in terms of average level the highest concentrations of meth in the m and m k groups were 208 0 ng g 1 on the 10th day and 270 4 ng g 1 on the 15th day respectively fig 4 a the peak concentration of ket was 288 6 ng g 1 on day 30 in the k treatment group and 474 0 ng g 1 on day 15 in the m k treatment group fig 4 c whereas the concentrations of both meth and ket in duckweed roots sampled from day 3 to day 20 were much higher than the average levels the maximum concentrations of meth were 1496 0 and 1506 0 ng g 1 in the m and m k groups respectively fig 4 b the peak concentrations of ket were 948 0 and 872 0 ng g 1 in the k and m k groups respectively fig 4 d the highest levels of the metabolites amp fig 4 a and b and norket fig 4 c and d in both duckweed and its roots were much lower than those of meth or ket ranging from 20 0 to 50 0 ng g 1 as a result both the precursor compounds and the metabolites may primarily accumulate in the roots of duckweed 3 3 bioaccumulation study the distributions of meth and ket and their metabolites in different media were performed in this work for the m and k groups as shown in fig 5 a meth degraded over 99 in the m ecosystem after 40 days of incubation and was mainly distributed in water during the first 6 days 83 99 and in duckweed during days 10 40 47 72 the sediment was the third accumulation site with a meth percentage ranging from 11 to 41 the proportion of meth in the fish was less than 1 fig 5 b shows that amp detected on days 3 20 was distributed mainly in water 93 on the 3rd day and in duckweed 12 68 medaka 7 35 bitterling fish 12 31 loach 3 21 and mosquito fish 8 20 during days 6 20 fig 5 c and d show that both ket and norket were mainly distributed in water 86 96 and then in the sediment 2 13 for ket 1 9 for norket and duckweed 1 15 for ket 2 6 for norket to further illustrate the different distribution of the compounds in fish their percentages are shown in fig s2 meth was predominantly ingested by loach followed by bitterling fish and amp was mainly distributed in medaka bitterling fish and loach both ket and norket were mainly absorbed by medaka followed by mosquito fish and bitterling fish furthermore correlation analysis between the crude protein and lipid contents and the maximum concentrations of the different compounds in the fish were determined to further elucidate the mechanism of the different distributions in the various types of fish as shown in table 1 the accumulation levels of ket and norket were negatively correlated with the crude protein content and a negative correlation between meth or amp and the crude lipid content was observed to further evaluate the bioaccumulation of the drugs the df was derived using the maximum concentration of the compounds in different media table 2 shows the various df values of meth and amp in different media the accumulation potential of duckweed loach and sediment should be noted since the df was 489 4 in duckweed 93 2 in loach and 3 2 in sediment while the df values of meth and amp in other media were less than 2 the df values of amp on day 3 showed that it tended to accumulate in fish compared with the accumulation in sediment and duckweed which may be because amp was predominantly produced by fish during metabolism moreover the df in the m k group was much higher than that in the m group which may be because the concentrations of meth and amp in the water in the m k group were much lower than those in the m group table 3 shows that ket in the k group accumulated mainly in duckweed df 25 2 and then in medaka df 9 5 and in mosquito fish df 9 3 the metabolite norket exhibited a similar trend moreover the difference in df values of ket and norket between the k and m k treatments was slight the df values at the incubation endpoint table s2 indicated that meth was predominantly absorbed in sediment and duckweed and ket was mainly taken up by duckweed medaka and mosquito fish 3 4 alteration of the toxicity and ph value of water during the incubation period fig 6 a shows the changes in the acute toxicity expressed as the bioluminescence inhibition rate ir of water in all ecosystems using the microtox acute toxicity test an increase in ir was observed in all groups during the incubation the toxicity of water in the bio control group was maintained at a non toxic level 10 ir 10 the increase may be due to xenobiotics released from the organisms or the sediment the results indicate that ket had trace toxicity with an ir 12 2 at 0 5 days whereas the byproducts of ket transformation exhibited a marked increase in toxicity to medium level after day 10 20 ir 50 the change in ir in the m k ecosystem was parallel to that in the k group which indicated that the metabolites of ket may be the main toxicants the ir in the control group ranged from 9 to 25 and that of the m k group was 11 44 indicating that the byproducts generated by organisms may exhibit higher toxicity than those produced by natural attenuation the ir in the m group increased from 11 3 to 23 0 up to a low level which indicates that the toxicity of the meth byproducts was stronger than that of the precursor compound as shown in fig 6 b the ph value in the ecosystems spiked with meth or ket first increased and then decreased while the value in the bio control group was maintained at a constant level the occurrence of alkali during chemical degradation may be because hydroxylation was the main transformation pathway for both ket and meth which would induce an increase in the content of free hydroxyl radicals in the water from 0 5 to 15 days however with the procession of the reaction hydrogen ions were released by carboxyl groups with the byproducts and the ph decreased after day 15 and stabilized after day 20 kuo et al 2015 lin et al 2014 at the endpoint the ph value of the control group was significantly higher than that of the other groups there was no marked difference between the ph values of these treatments indicating self mediation by the aquatic ecosystems containing organisms loreau and de mazancourt 2013 moreover the changes in ph during incubation might correlate with the increased toxicity alsop and wilson 2019 3 5 changes in the bacterial community in the sediments to further estimate the effect on the ecosystem induced by meth and ket during incubation the changes in the bacterial community in the sediments were analysed as shown in fig s3 the number of otus using a 3 sequence dissimilarity cutoff in all sediment samples ranged from 507 to 877 the shannon index values of sediment from the experimental groups varied from 6 2 to 7 8 and were markedly lower than those in s0 7 8 which indicated a decrease in sediment bacterial community diversity during incubation fig 7 a shows the wpgma clustering based on the otu level of all sediment samples the c and s0 samples were grouped together but distinguished from the other samples indicating that the presence of organisms in the ecosystem could significantly alter the sediment bacterial community moreover the samples from the b and m groups were clustered and separated from samples of the k and m k groups which indicates that ket biodegradation might affect the sediment bacterial community structure as shown in fig 7 b nine frequently detected bacterial phyla were identified among the sediment samples including proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes chloroflexi actinobacteria acidobacteria gemmatimonadetes and verrucomicrobia after 40 days of incubation the relative abundance of proteobacteria notably increased in all treatments 36 0 61 4 compared with that in s0 26 2 an increase in firmicutes abundance was observed in all ecosystems including the b m k and m k groups 16 5 30 3 compared with that in the c group 2 3 bacteroidetes was the predominant phylum in the k 15 1 m k 32 7 and m 9 58 groups while the relative abundance in the b group was 7 4 chloroflexi and actinobacteria were the dominant phyla in both the b and m treatment groups the relative abundances of them in the groups were 9 5 and 9 2 and 4 3 and 5 7 respectively our results indicated that organismal behaviour may significantly impact the bacterial community structure in sediment while the alterations of the bacterial community in the ecosystem induced by meth and ket should also not be overlooked 4 discussion the information on the biodegradation of meth by microorganisms in water is still limited in the literature wang et al 2018 indicated that the half life of meth was 43 days in fresh water and there was no significant decrease in meth observed during a 15 day incubation bagnall et al 2013 the half life in this work 7 83 days was much shorter than in previous studies the observation may be explained byvolatilization in the open system this study compared with the closed systems sealed bottles were used in previous works the water cycling system used in this work may have accelerated the degradation process in fact the result of the control experiment confirmed that ket was a stable pollutant in water t1 2 86 71 days which was consistent with the results of previous publications lin et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the removal rates of meth and ket in all bio ecosystems m k and m k groups were strikingly higher than in the control treatment group which indicated that the presence of organisms in aquatic ecosystems could facilitate the elimination of organic contaminants to date few publications have shown that the adsorption of meth and ket in sediment or sludge was negligible bagnall et al 2013 lin et al 2013 2014 moreover the two drugs are moderately hydrophobic organic compounds with log k ow octanol water partition coefficient values between 0 5 and 3 0 table s3 schnoor et al 1995 in this study the rapid adsorption of the two drugs by the sediment was observed in each ecosystem which may be due to differences in the composition of sediment the particle sizes used in this study were clay 30 silt 40 and sand 30 while sand was the major particle in previous studies clay and silt have been confirmed to have considerably stronger adsorption abilities compared with that of sand adamson et al 2016 liu and ball 2005 and meth tended to be adsorbed in soils with a relatively high clay proportion pal et al 2015 bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms is one of the possible fates of organic pollutants wilkinson et al 2017 in this study the bioaccumulation of meth was insignificant since the concentration of meth in the fish first increased and then decreased quickly the maximum levels in the fish were lower than 10 0 ng g 1 except for that in loach up to 40 ng g 1 the accumulation concentration of amp as a metabolite of meth was much higher than that of meth in the fish and was rarely detected in the water and sediment which indicates that the meth taken up by the fish was quickly metabolized to amp the dissipation of amp in the fish was slow compared to that in the water and sediment possibly because of its slight accumulation potential in organisms the concentration of meth and its metabolites in benthic organisms was investigated in previous studies and there was no detection of these metabolites in any of the fish samples collected in the field koba et al 2018 wilkinson et al 2018 however the bioconcentration of ket was obvious in medaka bitterling fish and mosquito fish as the concentrations increased during the incubation period but norket degraded quickly in the fish therefore ket tended to be absorbed by adlittoral fish while meth was dominantly ingested by bottom dwellers although a compound log k ow between 2 and 5 has been deemed to not likely be accumulated in organisms arnot and gobas 2006 a previous investigation found that pollutants with a log k oa octanol air partition coefficient 6 had bioaccumulation potential kelly et al 2007 as shown in table s3 the values of log k ow of meth and ket were between 2 and 5 but the values of log k oa of them were above 6 hence the two drugs may have bioaccumulation potential the df values obtained with the highest accumulation concentrations in this work indicated powerful uptake of meth and ket by duckweed whereas ket and norket showed slight bioaccumulation potential in fish moreover the df values of meth in loach and mosquito fish in the m k group were notably higher than those in the m group in contrast the df values of ket in these two fish in the k group were lower than those in the m k group these observations demonstrate that competitive ingestion may occur between the two drugs furthermore the highest concentrations of meth and ket in the different fish were found to correlate with the lipid or protein contents these results may contribute to the diverse metabolism pathways of the two drugs meth was mainly detected in brain tissue whereas ket was primarily observed in the liver and kidneys edwards and mather 2001 rivière et al 2000 meth metabolism is mainly catalysed by monoamine oxidase mao and the cytochrome p450 cyp isoenzymes cyp2c and cyp2d6 li et al 2010 as a result aromatic hydroxylation and n demethylation are the main metabolism pathways ket is metabolized mainly in the liver through both phase i cyp2b6 and ii intact glucuronide conjugation metabolism mechanisms turfus et al 2009 wang et al 2005 hence it was likely that ket would not accumulate in fish with a high protein content while a high lipid content in the fish inhibited the accumulation of meth for evaluation of the ecological impact of these drugs alterations in the acute toxicity of water during incubation should be considered compared with the toxicity in the biocontrol ecosystems maintained at a non toxic level the toxicity in the k and m k ecosystems ranged from non toxic to a medium level of toxicity ir 10 40 the toxicity level in the m and control ecosystems ranged from non toxic to a low level of toxicity ir 10 25 these results indicate that the byproducts of organic pollutants may have higher toxicity than that of the precursor compounds moreover the increases in toxicity in the groups spiked with ket indicated that the toxicants released during the degradation of ket may pose a threat to aquatic organisms this increase in toxicity was also observed in a previous study during sunlight photolysis of ket lin et al 2014 our previous study have generated information on the phylogenetic composition of water and sediment bacterial community during meth and ket degradation wang et al 2018 the phyla including betaproteobacteria mainly methylophilaceae and desulfobulbaceae and bacteroidetes mainly wchb1 69 and saprospiraceae were identified as the potential biodegradation candidatus in this study as shown in fig s4 the marked increase of the relative abundance of the classes including anaerolineae verrucomicrobiae coriobacteriia and bacteroidetes vadinha17 was observed in m group the relative abundance of several bacterial classes bacteroidia holophagae and verrucomicrobiae obtained a remarkable increase in k group after 40 day incubation the verrucomicrobiae class predominated in m k group the dominated classes in biocontrol group were anaerolineae and bacilli meanwhile the obvious decline of the relative abundance of the classes including thermomicrobia and nitrospira in all bio group compared with s0 or control group the most significant change in the bacterial community was observed in the m k treatment group followed by that in the k treatment group compared with that in the bio control group moreover the impact of ket in ecosystems may be stronger than that of meth and the combination of the two drugs may reinforce the disturbance of the bacterial community balance fig 7 a from the above results the potential biodegradation candidatus class for both meth and ket in sediment was verrucomicrobiae microorganisms acting as decomposers are one of the crucial integrant in aquatic ecosystems berg and laskowski 2005 the interruption of the microorganism community by meth and ket should be considered since it may adversely impact ecological equilibrium 5 conclusions we elucidated the environmental behaviour of illicit drugs i e meth and ket and their main metabolites i e amp and norket when present in aquatic ecosystems by using lab scale ecosystem experiments the degradation rates of the two drugs were significantly greater in the complex ecosystems containing organisms than in the water sediment ecosystem indicating that the presence of aquatic organisms can accelerate the dissipation of organic pollutants the adsorption of the two drugs moderately hydrophilic in sediment depended on the particle size and the adsorption potential of clay and silt was greater than that of sand since there were different distributions in different organs and various metabolism pathways of meth and ket the highest accumulation levels correlated with the lipid or protein contents meth was mainly detected in bottom dwelling fish whereas ket was mainly observed in shallow water fish an increase in acute toxicity was observed in all experimental groups especially in the k and m k groups suggesting that of the byproducts released during the incubation period may yield greater toxicity than the parent compound the changes in the bacterial community of the sediment induced by both meth and ket were significant compared with those observed in the bio control group these results demonstrate that at environmentally relevant concentrations meth and ket may have significant impact on the aquatic environment declaration of competing interest

18059,ketamine ket and methamphetamine meth have been recognized as emerging contaminants in aquatic ecosystems this paper aimed to investigate the environmental behaviour including the degradation distribution and bioaccumulation of meth ket and their main metabolites amphetamine amp and norketamine norket the changes in acute toxicity in the aqueous phase and in the bacterial community in sediment were determined to assess the associated eco risk of the drug exposure five types of lab scale aquatic ecosystems were established and exposed to ket or meth for 40 days a water sediment organisms ket system k a water sediment organisms meth system m a water sediment organism meth ket system m k a water sediment ket meth system control and a water sediment organisms system biocontrol the results demonstrated that much faster degradation occurred for both meth t1 2 3 89 and 2 37 days in the m and m k group respectively and ket t1 2 5 69 days 5 39 days in the k group and m k group respectively than in the control group t1 2 7 83 and 86 71days for meth and ket respectively rapid adsorption of ket meth and their metabolites was observed in the sediment which had clay and silt as the main particle sizes ket was observed to be absorbed by shallow water fish chinese medaka rosy bitterling and mosquito fish while meth was dominantly ingested by bottom dwellers loach duckweed might play a crucial role in the dissipation process of meth and ket which were mainly adsorbed by duckweed roots during incubation the acute toxic levels in the k and m k groups changed from non toxic to medium toxicity levels and the toxicity in the m and control groups changed from non toxic to low toxicity levels moreover marked changes in the bacterial community in the sediment induced by meth or ket exposure were observed and the most significant change in the bacterial community was observed in the group spiked with both meth and ket this work for the first time elucidated the environmental behaviors of meth and ket in aquatic ecosystem and associated the impact on ecological system equilibrium graphical abstract image 1 keywords psychoactive drugs lab scale ecosystem

use of these two drugs an increasing number of people have consumed them recreationally attracted to their psychotropic effects which has resulted in widespread occurrence of ket and meth in surface water systems originating from the effluents of municipal hospital and domestic wastewater plants du et al 2015 jiang et al 2015 lin et al 2010 notably in china ket and meth were observed at concentrations up to 275 and 239 ng l 1 respectively in rivers of mainland wang et al 2019 and up to 420 and 405 ng l 1 respectively in rivers in taiwan lin et al 2010 2014 in addition their chemical and biological activities could maintain when released into aquatic environment heberer 2002 thus the potential health risks and toxicity posed by the two drugs on aquatic organisms should not be overlooked previous investigations found that physiological biochemical and behavioural consequences were associated with ket and meth exposure in several aquatic organisms for example significant behavioral alterations of zebrafish were induced by meth and ket at 2 0 mg l 1 and ket at 0 8 mg l 1 respectively félix et al 2017 mi et al 2016 the shift in stereotyped behaviors of crayfish exposed

assess the risks of ket and meth to aquatic organisms it is also important to understand their fates in fresh water system however there were only three studies that examined the stability of the two drugs in surface water slight biodegradation 15 of meth was observed in a microcosm simulator with illumination after 15 days incubation bagnall et al 2013 the photostability of ket in surface water was examined using a sunlight simulation reactor and the half life was 12 6 h lin et al 2014 our previous work documented that the two drugs may be refractory in river systems using a microcosm model since the half lives of meth and ket were greater than 60 days in aqueous phase and more than 100 days in sediment wang et al 2018 nevertheless there is limited information on the environmental behaviour of the two drugs in complex aquatic systems lab scale aquatic ecosystems microcosms which simulate the physical and chemical conditions of natural systems have been widely used to investigate the fate and risk assessment of organic pollutants these system have the advantages of authenticity flexibility and feasibility de laender and janssen 2013 moreover artificial microcosms

ecosystems the half lives of meth in the m m k and control groups were approximately 3 89 2 37 and 7 83 days respectively moreover over 99 of meth was decomposed in both the m and m k groups while the degradation rate in the control group was approximately 77 9 at the end of the incubation period fig 1 a the degradation of ket in the control group was approximately 28 7 after the 40 day incubation period and the concentration was close to constant after day 20 while the residual concentration of ket significantly decreased over 80 after the 40 day incubation period in the k and m k treatments the t1 2 of ket in the k and m k groups was 5 69 and 5 39 days respectively which were comparatively lower that that 86 71 days in the control group fig 1 c as shown in fig 1 b and fig 1 d rapid distribution of both meth and ket in all treatments was observed in the sediment the concentrations of the two drugs in sediment initially increased and then decreased gradually in the experimental groups the maximum concentrations of meth in the m and m k treatments were 16 1 on day 6 and 12 4 on day 10 ng g 1 respectively the highest level of ket in the k group was 53 4 ng g 1 on day 15 and in the m k group it was 98 6 ng g 1 on day 10 in the control group the level of meth peaked on day 10 26 8 ng g 1 while that of ket peaked on day 20 123 2 ng g 1 the highest concentrations of the two drugs in sediments in the bio groups were notably lower than those in the control group which corresponded to different levels in the aqueous phase between the experimental groups and the control the highest concentration of meth occurred in the m group prior to that in the m k group while the maximum ket concentration in the k group was later during the incubation period than in the m k group indicating that there may be competitive adsorption between the two drugs the sediment may be an accumulation site of ket in the aquatic system since the level of ket was close to constant during the total exposure period of 40 days fig 1 d amphetamine amp a major metabolite of meth was detected in the water from the m and m k groups only on day 3 and the concentrations were 0 075 and 0 055 ng ml 1 respectively while there was no amp detection in the other groups fig 1 a and b fast degradation of amp in water and sediment has been reported in the previous publications bagnall et al 2013 wang et al 2018 the increase of norketamine norket the main metabolite of ket was observed in both the water and sediment from the k and m k ecosystems the highest concentrations in the water were 5 4 ng ml 1 in the k group and 5 1 ng ml 1 in the m k group in sediment the maximum concentrations were 10 9 ng g 1 and 10 3 ng g 1 in the k and m k treatments respectively fig 1 c and d in the control group norket was only detected in water after day 20 and the highest level of 0 4 ng ml 1 was observed on day 40 fig 1 c the results showed that norket in aquatic ecosystems may be mainly released through organismal metabolism and may possibly be accumulated in the sediments 3 2 distribution and degradation of chemicals in organisms as shown in fig 2 a rapid distribution of meth was observed on the 3rd day in all fish but the concentration was far lower than in the water phase except for in the loach the highest meth levels in medaka bitterling fish and mosquito fish were 5 7 8 6 and 2 2 ng g 1 in the m treatment and 4 9 12 6 and 2 6 ng g 1 in the m k treatment respectively fig 2 a c and d the meth concentration in loach fish peaked on the 15th day in both the m and m k ecosystems and the concentrations detected were 39 6 ng g 1 in the m group and 32 8 ng g 1 in the m k group fig 2 b moreover the accumulation of amp was found in all fish and the concentration increased first and then declined with incubation time fig 2 shows that the maximum concentrations of amp in medaka loach bitterling fish and mosquito fish were 49 3 23 8 49 0 and 17 1 ng g 1 respectively on the 10th day in the m group while the maximum amp concentrations in the loach and mosquito fish were observed on the 6th day and in medaka and bitterling fish on the 10th day in the m k group and the values were close to those observed in the m group fig 3 shows the changes in the ket and norket concentrations in different fish types and their levels showed an n shaped curve in the m k group in all fish except in the bitterling fish the maximum concentrations of ket in medaka loach bitterling and mosquito fish were 99 7 37 1 60 4 and 67 0 ng g 1 while the levels of norket were 46 3 6 8 20 5 and 36 5 ng g 1 respectively in the k treatment group the ket concentration in medaka bitterling fish and mosquito fish steadily increased during the incubation period and the levels on the 40th day were 85 7 55 4 and 83 8 ng g 1 respectively fig 3 a and d the highest concentration in loach was 36 6 ng g 1 on day 20 fig 3 b moreover the change in norket concentrations in the k group in all fish corresponded with the changes in ket concentrations the results showed that norket detected in bio ecosystems may be mainly excreted by aquatic organisms as shown in fig 4 significant bioaccumulation of meth and ket in duckweed was observed in this work in terms of average level the highest concentrations of meth in the m and m k groups were 208 0 ng g 1 on the 10th day and 270 4 ng g 1 on the 15th day respectively fig 4 a the peak concentration of ket was 288 6 ng g 1 on day 30 in the k treatment group and 474 0 ng g 1 on day 15 in the m k treatment group fig 4 c whereas the concentrations of both meth and ket in duckweed roots sampled from day 3 to day 20 were much higher than the average levels the maximum concentrations of meth were 1496 0 and 1506 0 ng g 1 in the m and m k groups respectively fig 4 b the peak concentrations of ket were 948 0 and 872 0 ng g 1 in the k and m k groups respectively fig 4 d the highest levels of the metabolites amp fig 4 a and b and norket fig 4 c and d in both duckweed and its roots were much lower than those of meth or ket ranging from 20 0 to 50 0 ng g 1 as a result both the precursor compounds and the metabolites may primarily accumulate in the roots of duckweed 3 3 bioaccumulation study the distributions of meth and ket and their metabolites in different media were performed in this work for the m and k groups as shown in fig 5 a meth degraded over 99 in the m ecosystem after 40 days of incubation and was mainly distributed in water during the first 6 days 83 99 and in duckweed during days 10 40 47 72 the sediment was the third accumulation site with a meth percentage ranging from 11 to 41 the proportion of meth in the fish was less than 1 fig 5 b shows that amp detected on days 3 20 was distributed mainly in water 93 on the 3rd day and in duckweed 12 68 medaka 7 35 bitterling fish 12 31 loach 3 21 and mosquito fish 8 20 during days 6 20 fig 5 c and d show that both ket and norket were mainly distributed in water 86 96 and then in the sediment 2 13 for ket 1 9 for norket and duckweed 1 15 for ket 2 6 for norket to further illustrate the different distribution of the compounds in fish their percentages are shown in fig s2 meth was predominantly ingested by loach followed by bitterling fish and amp was mainly distributed in medaka bitterling fish and loach both ket and norket were mainly absorbed by medaka followed by mosquito fish and bitterling fish furthermore correlation analysis between the crude protein and lipid contents and the maximum concentrations of the different compounds in the fish were determined to further elucidate the mechanism of the different distributions in the various types of fish as shown in table 1 the accumulation levels of ket and norket were negatively correlated with the crude protein content and a negative correlation between meth or amp and the crude lipid content was observed to further evaluate the bioaccumulation of the drugs the df was derived using the maximum concentration of the compounds in different media table 2 shows the various df values of meth and amp in different media the accumulation potential of duckweed loach and sediment should be noted since the df was 489 4 in duckweed 93 2 in loach and 3 2 in sediment while the df values of meth and amp in other media were less than 2 the df values of amp on day 3 showed that it tended to accumulate in fish compared with the accumulation in sediment and duckweed which may be because amp was predominantly produced by fish during metabolism moreover the df in the m k group was much higher than that in the m group which may be because the concentrations of meth and amp in the water in the m k group were much lower than those in the m group table 3 shows that ket in the k group accumulated mainly in duckweed df 25 2 and then in medaka df 9 5 and in mosquito fish df 9 3 the metabolite norket exhibited a similar trend moreover the difference in df values of ket and norket between the k and m k treatments was slight the df values at the incubation endpoint table s2 indicated that meth was predominantly absorbed in sediment and duckweed and ket was mainly taken up by duckweed medaka and mosquito fish 3 4 alteration of the toxicity and ph value of water during the incubation period fig 6 a shows the changes in the acute toxicity expressed as the bioluminescence inhibition rate ir of water in all ecosystems using the microtox acute toxicity test an increase in ir was observed in all groups during the incubation the toxicity of water in the bio control group was maintained at a non toxic level 10 ir 10 the increase may be due to xenobiotics released from the organisms or the sediment the results indicate that ket had trace toxicity with an ir 12 2 at 0 5 days whereas the byproducts of ket transformation exhibited a marked increase in toxicity to medium level after day 10 20 ir 50 the change in ir in the m k ecosystem was parallel to that in the k group which indicated that the metabolites of ket may be the main toxicants the ir in the control group ranged from 9 to 25 and that of the m k group was 11 44 indicating that the byproducts generated by organisms may exhibit higher toxicity than those produced by natural attenuation the ir in the m group increased from 11 3 to 23 0 up to a low level which indicates that the toxicity of the meth byproducts was stronger than that of the precursor compound as shown in fig 6 b the ph value in the ecosystems spiked with meth or ket first increased and then decreased while the value in the bio control group was maintained at a constant level the occurrence of alkali during chemical degradation may be because hydroxylation was the main transformation pathway for both ket and meth which would induce an increase in the content of free hydroxyl radicals in the water from 0 5 to 15 days however with the procession of the reaction hydrogen ions were released by carboxyl groups with the byproducts and the ph decreased after day 15 and stabilized after day 20 kuo et al 2015 lin et al 2014 at the endpoint the ph value of the control group was significantly higher than that of the other groups there was no marked difference between the ph values of these treatments indicating self mediation by the aquatic ecosystems containing organisms loreau and de mazancourt 2013 moreover the changes in ph during incubation might correlate with the increased toxicity alsop and wilson 2019 3 5 changes in the bacterial community in the sediments to further estimate the effect on the ecosystem induced by meth and ket during incubation the changes in the bacterial community in the sediments were analysed as shown in fig s3 the number of otus using a 3 sequence dissimilarity cutoff in all sediment samples ranged from 507 to 877 the shannon index values of sediment from the experimental groups varied from 6 2 to 7 8 and were markedly lower than those in s0 7 8 which indicated a decrease in sediment bacterial community diversity during incubation fig 7 a shows the wpgma clustering based on the otu level of all sediment samples the c and s0 samples were grouped together but distinguished from the other samples indicating that the presence of organisms in the ecosystem could significantly alter the sediment bacterial community moreover the samples from the b and m groups were clustered and separated from samples of the k and m k groups which indicates that ket biodegradation might affect the sediment bacterial community structure as shown in fig 7 b nine frequently detected bacterial phyla were identified among the sediment samples including proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes chloroflexi actinobacteria acidobacteria gemmatimonadetes and verrucomicrobia after 40 days of incubation the relative abundance of proteobacteria notably increased in all treatments 36 0 61 4 compared with that in s0 26 2 an increase in firmicutes abundance was observed in all ecosystems including the b m k and m k groups 16 5 30 3 compared with that in the c group 2 3 bacteroidetes was the predominant phylum in the k 15 1 m k 32 7 and m 9 58 groups while the relative abundance in the b group was 7 4 chloroflexi and actinobacteria were the dominant phyla in both the b and m treatment groups the relative abundances of them in the groups were 9 5 and 9 2 and 4 3 and 5 7 respectively our results indicated that organismal behaviour may significantly impact the bacterial community structure in sediment while the alterations of the bacterial community in the ecosystem induced by meth and ket should also not be overlooked 4 discussion the information on the biodegradation of meth by microorganisms in water is still limited in the literature wang et al 2018 indicated that the half life of meth was 43 days in fresh water and there was no significant decrease in meth observed during a 15 day incubation bagnall et al 2013 the half life in this work 7 83 days was much shorter than in previous studies the observation may be explained byvolatilization in the open system this study compared with the closed systems sealed bottles were used in previous works the water cycling system used in this work may have accelerated the degradation process in fact the result of the control experiment confirmed that ket was a stable pollutant in water t1 2 86 71 days which was consistent with the results of previous publications lin et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the removal rates of meth and ket in all bio ecosystems m k and m k groups were strikingly higher than in the control treatment group which indicated that the presence of organisms in aquatic ecosystems could facilitate the elimination of organic contaminants to date few publications have shown that the adsorption of meth and ket in sediment or sludge was negligible bagnall et al 2013 lin et al 2013 2014 moreover the two drugs are moderately hydrophobic organic compounds with log k ow octanol water partition coefficient values between 0 5 and 3 0 table s3 schnoor et al 1995 in this study the rapid adsorption of the two drugs by the sediment was observed in each ecosystem which may be due to differences in the composition of sediment the particle sizes used in this study were clay 30 silt 40 and sand 30 while sand was the major particle in previous studies clay and silt have been confirmed to have considerably stronger adsorption abilities compared with that of sand adamson et al 2016 liu and ball 2005 and meth tended to be adsorbed in soils with a relatively high clay proportion pal et al 2015 bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms is one of the possible fates of organic pollutants wilkinson et al 2017 in this study the bioaccumulation of meth was insignificant since the concentration of meth in the fish first increased and then decreased quickly the maximum levels in the fish were lower than 10 0 ng g 1 except for that in loach up to 40 ng g 1 the accumulation concentration of amp as a metabolite of meth was much higher than that of meth in the fish and was rarely detected in the water and sediment which indicates that the meth taken up by the fish was quickly metabolized to amp the dissipation of amp in the fish was slow compared to that in the water and sediment possibly because of its slight accumulation potential in organisms the concentration of meth and its metabolites in benthic organisms was investigated in previous studies and there was no detection of these metabolites in any of the fish samples collected in the field koba et al 2018 wilkinson et al 2018 however the bioconcentration of ket was obvious in medaka bitterling fish and mosquito fish as the concentrations increased during the incubation period but norket degraded quickly in the fish therefore ket tended to be absorbed by adlittoral fish while meth was dominantly ingested by bottom dwellers although a compound log k ow between 2 and 5 has been deemed to not likely be accumulated in organisms arnot and gobas 2006 a previous investigation found that pollutants with a log k oa octanol air partition coefficient 6 had bioaccumulation potential kelly et al 2007 as shown in table s3 the values of log k ow of meth and ket were between 2 and 5 but the values of log k oa of them were above 6 hence the two drugs may have bioaccumulation potential the df values obtained with the highest accumulation concentrations in this work indicated powerful uptake of meth and ket by duckweed whereas ket and norket showed slight bioaccumulation potential in fish moreover the df values of meth in loach and mosquito fish in the m k group were notably higher than those in the m group in contrast the df values of ket in these two fish in the k group were lower than those in the m k group these observations demonstrate that competitive ingestion may occur between the two drugs furthermore the highest concentrations of meth and ket in the different fish were found to correlate with the lipid or protein contents these results may contribute to the diverse metabolism pathways of the two drugs meth was mainly detected in brain tissue whereas ket was primarily observed in the liver and kidneys edwards and mather 2001 rivière et al 2000 meth metabolism is mainly catalysed by monoamine oxidase mao and the cytochrome p450 cyp isoenzymes cyp2c and cyp2d6 li et al 2010 as a result aromatic hydroxylation and n demethylation are the main metabolism pathways ket is metabolized mainly in the liver through both phase i cyp2b6 and ii intact glucuronide conjugation metabolism mechanisms turfus et al 2009 wang et al 2005 hence it was likely that ket would not accumulate in fish with a high protein content while a high lipid content in the fish inhibited the accumulation of meth for evaluation of the ecological impact of these drugs alterations in the acute toxicity of water during incubation should be considered compared with the toxicity in the biocontrol ecosystems maintained at a non toxic level the toxicity in the k and m k ecosystems ranged from non toxic to a medium level of toxicity ir 10 40 the toxicity level in the m and control ecosystems ranged from non toxic to a low level of toxicity ir 10 25 these results indicate that the byproducts of organic pollutants may have higher toxicity than that of the precursor compounds moreover the increases in toxicity in the groups spiked with ket indicated that the toxicants released during the degradation of ket may pose a threat to aquatic organisms this increase in toxicity was also observed in a previous study during sunlight photolysis of ket lin et al 2014 our previous study have generated information on the phylogenetic composition of water and sediment bacterial community during meth and ket degradation wang et al 2018 the phyla including betaproteobacteria mainly methylophilaceae and desulfobulbaceae and bacteroidetes mainly wchb1 69 and saprospiraceae were identified as the potential biodegradation candidatus in this study as shown in fig s4 the marked increase of the relative abundance of the classes including anaerolineae verrucomicrobiae coriobacteriia and bacteroidetes vadinha17 was observed in m group the relative abundance of several bacterial classes bacteroidia holophagae and verrucomicrobiae obtained a remarkable increase in k group after 40 day incubation the verrucomicrobiae class predominated in m k group the dominated classes in biocontrol group were anaerolineae and bacilli meanwhile the obvious decline of the relative abundance of the classes including thermomicrobia and nitrospira in all bio group compared with s0 or control group the most significant change in the bacterial community was observed in the m k treatment group followed by that in the k treatment group compared with that in the bio control group moreover the impact of ket in ecosystems may be stronger than that of meth and the combination of the two drugs may reinforce the disturbance of the bacterial community balance fig 7 a from the above results the potential biodegradation candidatus class for both meth and ket in sediment was verrucomicrobiae microorganisms acting as decomposers are one of the crucial integrant in aquatic ecosystems berg and laskowski 2005 the interruption of the microorganism community by meth and ket should be considered since it may adversely impact ecological equilibrium 5 conclusions we elucidated the environmental behaviour of illicit drugs i e meth and ket and their main metabolites i e amp and norket when present in aquatic ecosystems by using lab scale ecosystem experiments the degradation rates of the two drugs were significantly greater in the complex ecosystems containing organisms than in the water sediment ecosystem indicating that the presence of aquatic organisms can accelerate the dissipation of organic pollutants the adsorption of the two drugs moderately hydrophilic in sediment depended on the particle size and the adsorption potential of clay and silt was greater than that of sand since there were different distributions in different organs and various metabolism pathways of meth and ket the highest accumulation levels correlated with the lipid or protein contents meth was mainly detected in bottom dwelling fish whereas ket was mainly observed in shallow water fish an increase in acute toxicity was observed in all experimental groups especially in the k and m k groups suggesting that of the byproducts released during the incubation period may yield greater toxicity than the parent compound the changes in the bacterial community of the sediment induced by both meth and ket were significant compared with those observed in the bio control group these results demonstrate that at environmentally relevant concentrations meth and ket may have significant impact on the aquatic environment declaration of competing interest
