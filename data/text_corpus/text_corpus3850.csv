19250,capacitive de ionization cdi systems are well known for their low energy consumption making them suitable for applications powered by renewable energy in this study cdi technology is for the first time integrated with a suitably scaled stand alone renewable power system comprising photovoltaic panels and battery storage guidelines for designing and sizing such power systems are proposed including determining electrode charging current pv panels and battery capacity a 1 kw pilot plant was designed constructed and operated to verify the proposed guidelines using the pilot plant the total energy consumption of the system has been evaluated with different electrode charging currents and influent flow rates and the relationship between these parameters analyzed this analysis has enabled the development of practical design guidelines for bulk water treatment with mcdi electrodes the results of this study show that use of photovoltaic powered mcdi water treatment particularly when combined with energy recovery is competitive against more mature water treatment technologies for particular applications and at particular locations graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane capacitive deionization solar battery renewable energy 1 introduction with greater water scarcity caused by increasing population rapid industrialization widespread water pollution and global climate change desalination has emerged as a critical process in maintaining adequate water supply desalination involves the use of a water treatment technology to produce freshwater from either seawater or brackish groundwater and is becoming more widespread in response to increasing global water deficiency elimelech and phillip 2011 ghaffour et al 2013 capacitive deionization cdi as a promising alternative to classical desalination technologies such as reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed and distillation is attracting increasing attention and has progressed enormously in recent years given the potential for energy efficient and cost effective treatment especially for brackish waters almarzooqi et al 2014 oren 2008 pekala et al 1998 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 cdi is an electrochemical technology that typically involves use of porous carbon electrodes for ion removal from aqueous solutions during charging of electrode pairs ions are adsorbed into electrical double layers edl in the pore space of the carbon lowering the salinity of the influent stream the charging step is followed by a discharging step with the ions being desorbed from the electrodes into a waste stream with the resultant high concentration solution either discarded as waste or reused in some manner generally the adsorption desorption cycles involve reversible electrostatic interactions with the charged electrode pairs acting as a capacitor in which energy is stored work is done in forcing the oppositely charged ion pairs apart and accumulating these ions in the electrodes with the separation of ions accounting for the increase in potential energy in the system during the charging step when discharged a portion of the energy stored in the electrical double layers during adsorption can be recovered during desorption długołęcki and van der wal 2013 kang et al 2016 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 zhao et al 2013a a major development in cdi technology in recent years has been the inclusion of ion exchange membranes on the separator side of each electrode with an anion exchange membrane placed adjacent to the anode and a cation exchange membrane placed adjacent to the cathode membrane capacitive deionization mcdi results in enhanced performance with the membranes allowing for counter ion transport from the spacer channel into the electrode while preventing co ions from leaving the electrode region thereby increasing ion storage in the electrode macropores and enhancing charge efficiency biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 długołęcki and van der wal 2013 kim and choi 2010 cdi and mcdi are the most common cell architectures in the cdi field and are currently being actively explored for water treatment with a focus on applications in brackish water

dykstra et al 2016 porada et al 2012 qu et al 2015 zhao et al 2013b the potential of mcdi to be used in conjunction with renewable energy sources however has yet to be properly explored given the low power consumption low pressure compared to ro and low temperatures compared to distillation mcdi technologies would seem ideal for salt removal from brackish waters at the scale of thousands of liters of treated water production per hour in this study using a design process for specifying the critical elements of a renewable powered system a pilot scale 5 m3 day mcdi system powered with photovoltaics pv and battery storage has been designed constructed and operated this is the first integration of pv with mcdi technologies at useful scales and represents a critical step in designing and operating cdi systems in applications remote from the power grid details regarding the design effectiveness of salt removal water recovery and energy consumption of a photovoltaic powered mcdi system pv mcdi are provided in this work experimental results are compared with those of pv powered systems that incorporate other water treatment technologies including ro bian et al 2016 bilton et al 2011 elasaad et al 2015 lakeh et al 2017 schäfer et al 2007 and ed fernandez gonzalez et al 2015 wright 2014 wright and winter 2017 2 guidelines for design of a large scale mcdi system powered by pv battery in this section we provide a procedure for the design of an mcdi plant powered by pv modules and a battery system as shown in fig 1 critically due to the limited input energy from the pv modules reducing the system energy consumption and increasing efficiency is imperative to assist in achieving this during the desorption step in which salt is released the electrode terminals are simply short circuited together rather than reverse charging of the electrodes as the latter consumes additional energy the disadvantage of this approach is that desorption duration is prolonged however this can be improved by advanced desorption methods which are not the focus of this study and possibly by varying the influent rates during the adsorption and desorption steps in this study the influent rates are constant during the process required specifications are the total dissolved solids tds of the feed water and the resultant product and the target product volume which determines the pump flow rate hence pump power the power requirement of the ancillary equipment also needs to be included in the energy analysis essential parameters of the design are the charging current of the mcdi electrode s and the total average input power from the pv system to the plant the outputs from the design procedure are the number of pv panels the battery size and number and the electrode charging current these various parameters are color coded in the flowchart provided in fig 1 where the design procedure is divided into four boxes calculating electrode charging current dashed boxes 1 and 2 sizing of pv panels dashed box 3 and sizing of batteries dashed box 4 the total required charge for the electrode q mcdi in coulombs provided by the power supply and the total charging time t ads day in seconds is essential in determining the average input current to the electrode s in dashed box 1 q mcdi is obtained by calculating the amount of salt to be removed the given product volume v prod in liters and the desired change of tds δtds in mg l i e the differential conductivity between that of feed water and of product charge efficiency should be taken into account η mcdi and 0 8 is assumed here a value for q mcdi can be determined from equation 1 1 q m c d i v p r o d δ t d s m o l s a l t f 1 η m c d i where f is faraday s constant and mol salt is the molar mass of the treated salt in dashed box 2 to obtain the total charge time or the total adsorption time t ads day during one day the duration of the adsorption step t ads in seconds the desorption step t des in seconds and the duration of the full cycle should be pre determined logically with the constant influent flow rate t des should be shorter than t ads if adequate water recovery is to be achieved as water recovery is t ads t des t ads if for example t des 0 5 t ads in theory a water recovery of 67 would result hence the water recovery in a constant flow rate system is approximately determined by the ratio of t des and t ads to estimate t des the electrode cell can be modelled electrically as a resistor capacitor discharge circuit with a time constant ᴦ given by the product of circuit resistance r and capacitance c ᴦ rc if t des is set to half of the time constant t des 0 5 ᴦ then the energy discharged from the cell during t des is approximately 60 of the stored electrostatic energy in the cell at the termination of t ads in such a case t ads would then be ᴦ these relationships highlight the inter dependencies between the electrical and hydraulic aspects of the system as t des is decreased water recovery improves energy consumption per unit of treated influent decreases and the product rate increases r is dominated by the circuit resistance external to the electrode terminals e g line resistance contact resistance since the internal resistance of the electrode is recognized to be much smaller than the external resistance in high charging current i e greater than 100 a applications the external resistance needs to be kept as low as possible in the order of mω to minimize ohmic power losses and prevent material damage due to high temperatures the capacitance of the electrode can be estimated by applying a constant charging current and measuring the change in cell voltage the total adsorption time t ads day in seconds during one day can be obtained from the formula 2 t a d s d a y t a d s t a d s t d e s t s t b 3600 24 where t stb is the duration of the standby period between adsorption and desorption steps and accounts for the time required to transport the water out of the electrode the electrodes are electrically disconnected during the standby step with the duration of this step suggested to be no longer than 1 10 of the full cycle time as it will reduce the utilization of the electrode the volume of the electrode and influent flow rate can also provide guidance in choosing the standby time t stb from equations 1 and 2 the total average input current i ch mcdi tot to the electrode is 3 i c h m c d i t o t q m c d i t a d s d a y i c h m c d i i c h m c d i t o t n where i ch mcdi tot is the current required for daily salt removal this value can be higher than the maximum input current of a single electrode indicating that multiple electrodes n or multiple treatment steps may be necessary in achieving salt removal and treated water volume goals in view of the appropriate input current to a single mcdi electrode i ch mcdi total average input power p in plant in kilo watts to the mcdi electrode should be calculated before a decision is reached on the number of pv modules and the battery capacity and number required the type of batteries for the plant should be determined so that the voltage at a certain depth of charge dod in percentage is known this voltage will be used in calculating the battery discharge current which is critical in terms of battery lifetime in dashed box 2 the peak sun hours can be obtained from meteorological records in the case study described here these were recorded by the australian bureau of meteorology bom we suggest the use of peak sun hours averaged over a year hours avg peak sun in hours for the design rather than minimum or maximum hours the use of minimum peak sun hours would result in an oversized surface area of pv panels significantly increasing the system size and leading to energy curtailment from pv panels in summer concomitantly a design based on maximum sun hours would lead to fewer pv panels and lower capacity batteries potentially leading to a significant energy shortage in winter once the average peak sun hours have been determined the total output power of the pv panels p pv total in kilo watts can be estimated the number of pv panels n pvpanels required can thus be deduced for a particular pv product s average output power given the peak sun hours p out pvpanel as shown in equation 4 4 p p v t o t a l p i n p l a n t h o u r s a v g p e a k s u n n p v p a n e l

materials and equipment in accordance with the system design procedure described above an mcdi pilot plant powered by a pv battery system for 24 h operation was designed and tested the potential applications of this plant include i provision of drinking water by treating brackish water for remote communities where grid electricity is either not provided is unreliable or is too expensive and ii provision of irrigation water for high value crops while the source water quality and treated volume required may differ from case to case we assume for the purposes of this study that the tds of feed water is around 1200 mg l and that product demand is less than 10 m3 day specifically the design of the prototype unit described below is based around a target δtds of 800 mg l and product volume of 5 m3 day the mcdi units model c 17 22 fcld rg used in the plant are from voltea b v the netherlands these units are cylindrical with a diameter of 28 cm and a height of 70 cm and can hold 11 l water the range of input current and voltage is 0 400 a and 0 2 v respectively at ambient temperature the flow rate range can be 0 1 1 3 m3 hour and the cells have a maximum rated pressure of 10 bar 3 1 1 mcdi electrode the total electrode charge required is related to the mass of salt to be removed and can be calculated using the change of conductivity and product volume in this study nacl of molar mass 58 44 g mol was used as the target species according to equation 1 the required charge q mcdi for one day of operation was 8 26 106 c with 100 a constant current applied to the electrode the rate of change of voltage provides an estimate of the capacitance of the electrode with the electrode capacitance for the prototype system described here estimated at 4 5 104 f the power supply output voltage and the terminal voltage across the electrode were measured enabling an estimate of the total external resistance of 4 1 mω determined by dividing the voltage difference between the power supply and electrode terminals by the charging current the time constant ᴦ can then be calculated and was equal to 184 5 s indicating that the duration of the desorption step t des should be 92 25 s as described in section 2 if the adsorption duration is twice that of the desorption time to preserve reasonable water recovery rates then t ads is equal to 184 5 s in light of these calculations 180 s was used for adsorption t ads 95 s for desorption t des and 25 s in total for the standby stage i e each t stb 12 5 s resulting in a full cycle time of 300 s using equation 2 the total adsorption time t ads day was determined to be 51 840 s 14 4 h per day and the total average charging current i ch mcdi tot to the mcdi electrodes was 159 3 a this current was considered to be in the range of the input current of one mcdi electrode and as such n in equation 3 was set to 1 thus in summary the plant only requires a single electrode with charging current i ch mcdi of 159 3 a to achieve the specified treated volume at the required change in conductivity the final voltage of the electrode in the adsorption step v ads was set at 1 3 v bouhadana et al 2010 choi 2014 as the adsorption time is 180 s this means the initial electrode voltage v des is 0 66 v in steady operation with the assumption that the electrode is a 4 5 104 f ideal capacitor for a linear increase of the cell voltage during the adsorption step the average voltage of the electrode v mcdi is 0 98 v 0 5 v des v ads 3 1 2 total input power of the mcdi plant before calculating the total input power using equation 6 where p ancillary in kilo watts is the ancillary equipment power consumption the voltage and the type of batteries to be used should be determined 12 v was employed for the supply voltage level of the plant to enable the incorporation of single stage bi directional converter circuits valve regulated lead acid vrla gel batteries were considered most appropriate as this type of battery requires less maintenance and is well suited to the cyclic discharge and energy storage required of pv systems 6 p t o t a l p i n m c d i p p u m p p a n c i l l a r y battery voltage decreases over time as the battery discharges and as such the discharge termination voltage should be determined by selecting a suitable depth of discharge a dod at 50 balances the usage of the battery capacity with the number and depth of charge recharge cycles from the data sheet of the chosen family of batteries the voltage at 50 of dod is 12 2 v the energy consumption of the power supply associated with the electrode was included in the energy usage by using a conservative efficiency of 70 for the electrode power supply η conv the total input power to the mcdi p in mcdi was calculated to be 0 134 kw using equation 7 7 p i n m c d i t a d s i c h m c d i v m c d i t a d s t d e s t s d b 1 η c o n v 1 1000 the pump also consumes energy with the power consumption p pump varying with flow rate the flow rate was determined from the required product volume 5 m3 day and the water recovery assumed here to be a modest 60 with these constraints the required influent flow rate was 5 76 l per minute lpm a 12 v dc pump was selected with open flow rate of 18 9 lpm the pump flow was adjusted by varying its supply voltage via a voltage controller according to the pump characteristics the power consumption of the pump was 0 04 kw considering the efficiency of the pump voltage controller 80 0 05 kw was used for the pump input power the power required to operate ancillary equipment including micro controller valves and relays with line losses taken into account was measured at 0 06 kw consequently the total input power of the plant which is the sum of the input power of the mcdi electrode the pump and the ancillary equipment was 0 244 kw resulting in a total energy requirement for the mcdi plant over one day of 5 86 kwh 3 1 3 pv panels as indicated in section 2 information on peak sun hours can be obtained from the metrological records for the location maintained in this case by the australian bom http www bom gov au climate averages tables cw 066062 shtml the maximum peak sun hours at the location in which this study was undertaken was 7 8 h in november while the minimum was 5 5 h in june as such an average peak sun hours of 6 h was used in calculations according to equation 4 p pv total is determined to be 0 976 kw hence three 310 w peak power pv panels were chosen for provision of power to the plant 3 1 4 batteries the average discharge current i dis batt of the batteries was 20 a based on an output voltage of 12 2 v an output power of 0 244 kw and dod of 50 as explained in section 3 1 2 the required capacity of the batteries ah batt total was 720 ah we chose to use two 300 ah batteries in parallel sharing the discharge current i e each battery delivers 10 a considering the plant economics and available space in the unit according to the charge and discharge curves in the battery datasheet two batteries would supply the rated current for 15 h before the voltage dropped to 12 2 v indicating a dod of 50 by adjusting the load such as by lowering the pump flow rate during the night the batteries would be able to provide continuous supply until the next charging cycle commences 3 2 materials and equipment a 12 v dc diaphragm pump model sfdp1 050 060 51 from seaflo open flow rate is 18 9 l per minute lpm was employed to pump the water through the pre treatment and mcdi columns the relationship between the flow rate voltage and power of the pump was determined for the plant used in this study the pre treatment step consisted of sequential filtration through two 5 μm polymer filters and one activated carbon filter analytical grade sodium chloride nacl sigma aldrich and 18 mω cm milli q water millipore were used for the preparation of the feed stream the photovoltaic system consisted of three wsp 300m6 winaico solar panels connected in series to provide 930 w of peak power each panel contained 60 silicon cells 156 75 mm 156 75 mm in series forming a surface area of 1 47 m2 and a nominal power output of 310 wpeak per panel two 12 v dc 300 ah valve regulated lead acid gel batteries 12 eg 300 endurogel were used for energy storage a flexmax 60 outback power charge controller with a maximum output current of 60 a was used to process the energy between the pv panels and the storage batteries tracking the maximum power point and converting the pv output to a suitable voltage for charging the batteries a system display and controller mate3 outback power was used to monitor and record information from the charge controller data related to the pv battery system in this study were obtained from this controller including pv voltage battery current energy converted from the pv panels in kwh and ampere hours supplied to the batteries a switched mode dc dc converter designed to supply the electrode from the 12 v supply was used in this study the input voltage of the converter ranged from 4 5 v to 16 v with output voltage of up to 2 1 v and output dc current of up to 200 a the efficiency of the dc dc converters was above 85 in step down mode when the input voltage was 12 v output voltage was 1 0 v and output current ranged between 55 a and 200 a 3 3 experimental setup the electrical schematic of the mcdi plant is shown in fig 2 a three pv panels were the only source of energy for the treatment plant the maximum power point tracking mppt charge controller flexmax60 converted the higher voltage dc supply from the pv panels to 12 14 v dc for charging of the batteries during daylight the plant was driven by energy generated by the pv panels with excess electrical energy stored in the batteries during the period when there was little or no solar irradiance the plant was powered primarily from the batteries relay 1 was a high current relay 350 a used to connect disconnect the electrode to from the dc dc power supply relay 2 also a high current relay was used to short circuit the electrode in the desorption step the plant was installed in an enclosure such that the pv panels were used as a canopy providing modest shade the plant could then be orientated to maximize the solar irradiance during daylight for this study the panels were mounted on the roof of a building to maximize solar exposure in the heavily built up environment a schematic of the mcdi prototype is shown in fig 2 b the possibility existed of placing additional electrodes in parallel hydraulically to enhance the production although only one electrode was used in this study a single pass approach was used in all studies described here with the influent sourced from a feed tank with the product and waste streams separated into their respective tanks the influent was pumped at a constant flow rate through the mcdi electrode and a constant but adjustable electrode current was used to adsorb the ions in the influent via electrosorption onto the carbon electrodes when the voltage across the terminals reached the set point voltage of 1 3 v bouhadana et al 2010 choi 2014 the charging current was turned off and the power supply was disconnected from the electrode a standby stage during which the electrode was electrically disconnected from the power supply and the pump continued running enabled the treated water remaining in the electrode to be removed a 12 5 s standby stage between the adsorption and desorption steps is used in the studies described here during the desorption step the mcdi cell terminals were short circuited discharging the electrosorbed ions back into the influent channel the duration of the desorption step was 95 s as explained in section 3 1 1 the influent and effluent conductivity and voltage across the terminals of the mcdi column were recorded using two conductivity probes con bta vernier corp usa and a voltage probe vp bta vernier corp usa to measure power consumption a lecroy waverunner 64xi oscilloscope with voltage probe and current probe lecroy cp500 attachments was used in all cases results were shown as an average of three steady state cycles i e cycles which repeat almost unchanged for investigative purposes only an influent solution containing 4000 mg l of nacl was used in the prototype studies the performance of the unit was assessed for various constant charging currents between 100 and 200 a factors underpinning choice of applied current were presented in section 3 1 1 for influent flow rates of 3 12 lpm subsequently the energy consumption during operation and the desalting performance of the mcdi unit were analyzed in order to provide information on energy costs for larger scale systems the water recovery in the studies described here is calculated as follows 8 water recovery v p r o d v t 100 where v prod and v t l are the volume of treated water produced in one cycle and the total water used in one cycle respectively the product was defined as the treated water with conductivity lower than the feed water in the adsorption step and the following standby step and was collected in the product tank the remainder of the water not collected in the product tank was defined as waste the specific ion j adsorption per cycle n j mol is derived by integrating the difference between the effluent concentration c j eff mm and the influent concentration c j inf mm over time s t 0 t ads and multiplying by the flow rate q m3 s 1 the expression nj is given by the integral 9 n j q t 0 t a d s c j e f f c j inf d t the current efficiency ce of the system defined as the ratio of the charge of ions removed from the influent to the charge inserted into the electrode is given by the expression 10 c e n j n a q e t 0 t a d s i d t where n a is avogadro s constant and q e is the electron charge 4 results and discussion 4 1 operation of the mcdi electrode experiments were undertaken using the prototype in order to explore the energy consumption of the plant operating under various conditions in these experiments termination of the adsorption step was determined solely by the electrode terminal voltage reaching the set point voltage of 1 3 v the desorption period was fixed at 95 s and the standby step at 12 5 s moreover a flow rate of 5 22 lpm was used with this value lower than the original design flow rate of 5 76 lpm as such it is expected that the change of conductivity will be marginally different from the design performance results for different electrode charging currents at the same constant flow rate 5 22 lpm are shown in table 1 the charge efficiency defined in equation 10 and presented in table 1 indicates that the assumptions made for equation 1 are reasonable based on the linear regression fit through the experimental data a change of conductivity of 800 mg l can be achieved for a charging current of 136 a and an adsorption period of 214 4 s this charging current is slightly lower than the original design current for removal of 800 mg l of salt because the flow rate is slightly lower than design grey marker in fig 3 a for a constant flow rate increasing the charging current proportionally increases the change in effluent concentration fig 3 a zhao et al 2012 as ion electrosorption per cycle is independent of the charging current with this size of electrode the cause of the greater change in ion concentration is due to the duration of the charging stage the volume of product decreases when the charging current increases as less time is required to reach the 1 3 v adsorption termination voltage thereby resulting in lower product volumes given a fixed flow rate high electrode charging currents were demonstrated to result in poor treatment efficiency firstly the higher current results in rapid extraction of ions from solution with the result that the resistance of the aqueous stream in the electrode rises quickly leading to a shorter time for the electrode to reach its end voltage secondly as the desorption time is fixed to a factor of the electrical time constant of the shorted electrode shorter adsorption times mean less treated water is produced resulting in lower water recovery in agreement with previous work zhao et al 2013a results obtained with constant electrode charging current 150 a and different influent flow rates are shown in table 2 with key results plotted in fig 3 b the adsorption durations of the four tests were almost identical with the electrode consuming similar amounts of energy in each case additionally similar total salt removal figures were observed in each case with the change in salt concentration approximately inversely proportional to the flow rate the performance of the electrode when different influent conductivities were used is shown in fig 4 the charging current for these studies was set at 150 a and the flow rate at 5 lpm the feed conductivities of the three experiments were 3314 mg l 2384 mg l and 1560 mg l respectively the upper traces show the electrode terminal voltage while the lower traces show the conductivities measured at the outlet of the electrode as can be seen from fig 4 the voltage linearly increases during the adsorption step which verifies the assumption made in the design procedures that the electrode may be treated as a capacitor the durations of the adsorption steps vary slightly as a result of the small differences in the end voltages importantly it can be seen from fig 4 that the change in tds is consistently above 900 mg l this demonstrates that the feed water salt concentration at levels higher than 1000 mg l has little influence on the change in tds when the charging current and the flow rate are kept constant as such once the electrode charging current and influent flow rate are decided it should be possible to reliably predict the expected product quality the results of the studies described here indicate that 1 tds changes linearly with the electrode charging current when the influent flow rate is fixed 2 tds changes inversely with the influent flow rate when the charging current is fixed and 3 product volume changes linearly with influent flow rate using this information and equations 1 7 system energy usage can be predicted given a particular flow rate and electrode charging current as a consequence the system controller can be used to calculate in real time the appropriate load for the batteries according to the input power from the pv panels and time of the day required to achieve best operational performance 4 2 energy usage of components in the mcdi plant the hourly energy usage of the mcdi plant and subcomponents under different charging currents and different influent rates is illustrated in fig 5 the energy consumption of the pump was measured and the voltage controller that operates the pump had an efficiency of 80 the ancillary equipment consumed a constant 60 w representing 0 06 kwh of energy usage per hour the energy usage of major components is shown in fig 5 a when influent rate is constant at 5 22 lpm and the charging current is varied pump and ancillary equipment were seen to consume a similar amount of energy to the mcdi electrode the results presented in fig 5 b show that when influent rate increases the energy consumption of the pump significantly increases and becomes higher than the energy used by the mcdi electrode desalination using mcdi electrodes only requires low pressure feed water the pre treatment filters increase the required system pressure by 2 bar leading to higher power consumption by the pump at an appropriate scale there is merit in separating the pre treatment stage from the mcdi plant if system energy consumption is to be reduced especially when the input energy is limited attention should also be paid to the performance at high influent flow rates since energy usage of the pump dramatically increases with flow rate as can be seen from fig 5 b when the flow is 12 lpm energy usage of other equipment is 50 higher than that of the electrode resulting in elevated energy use additionally the change of tds is low when the influent flow is high i e if high change of tds or low product tds is required then the flow rate through each electrode must be kept low a configuration with hydraulically parallel electrodes with slow influent flow to each electrode should be considered if the target performance cannot be met with a single electrode recovery of energy from the electrode with subsequent storage in the battery during the desorption stage was also investigated in this study previous studies were limited in scale and did not involve battery recharge długołęcki and van der wal 2013 fig 6 shows a full cycle of operation of the mcdi electrode with a bi directional dc dc converter used for recovering the electrode energy to the batteries during the desorption step the charging and discharge current in the adsorption and desorption step was 120 a the desorption termination voltage was set at the start voltage of the adsorption step in order to assess the recoverable energy in the electrode during the desorption step the energy used to charge the electrode in the adsorption step was determined to be 26 0 kj during the desorption step 16 1 kj could be recovered when the end voltage was the same as the end voltage for a 95 s short circuit desorption which represents 62 of the energy used in the adsorption step during the first 95 s of desorption with energy recovery 10 5 kj 40 of the total input energy was recovered consequently the energy usage of the mcdi electrode listed in tables 1 and 2 can be reduced conservatively by 30 making allowances for losses in the converter circuit 4 3 energy budget in the study described here the total converted solar energy during good insolation days was above 5 3 kwh while on poorer days this dropped to 3 kwh based on the efficiency and the total surface area of the three pv panels the average solar exposure was determined to be 2 89 kwh m 2 the 5 3 kwh produced in winter when peak sun hours are minimum was 91 of the energy requirements of the plant 5 86 kwh with this result indicating that the plant will have enough energy on average from the pv panels most of the year this result demonstrates the robustness of the guidelines described earlier with respect to choice of pv panels when the daily input energy from the pv panels is not sufficient the plant can adopt a lower energy plan which can be achieved by reducing the electrode charging current or the influent flow rate to realize 24 h operation the tests were performed in winter when demand for product water is likely to be lower than in other seasons so lowering the product rate may be acceptable in other seasons the power derived from the photovoltaic panels should be more than sufficient to allow for 24 h operation at 5 lpm influent flow rate and an 800 mg l change in salt concentration fig 7 shows the output current from the charge controller and the battery voltage for a cloudy day 24 05 2018 and a sunny day 31 05 2018 with 25 a of battery discharge current the time resolution is 10 s by 0900 the solar panels are fully exposed to sunlight and the output current rises to 40 a once the charge controller detects sunlight in the afternoon around 1430 the current falls below 40 a giving peak sun hours of 5 5 h both sub figures in fig 7 show that when being charged the battery voltage reaches 13 5 v and remains at this voltage as the battery state of charge is greater than 80 if the output current from the charge controller is higher than the unit consumption the batteries will be charged otherwise the batteries will discharge this means the process controller should dynamically adjust the load so that the plant can preserve energy and operate for a longer time fig 7 b shows that strong and constant solar exposure can provide enough energy for powering the mcdi operation with excess energy to charge the batteries hence the battery voltage does not fall much until the peak sun hour period ends subsequently the controller should adjust the load such that the batteries are able to support the plant to operate in excess of 20 h 4 4 optimum operation of the mcdi plant operation of mcdi plants especially for those with a limited supply of energy should be optimized to reduce system capital cost and energy usage this is imperative in scenarios where larger changes of tds are required in this section the optimum operational principles for pv powered mcdi plants are discussed the mcdi cells should ideally be configured such that the final product is obtained from feed water with only one treatment hence all the employed cells only process feed water and produce the final product with one adsorption step as shown in fig 4 b while multiple sequential adsorption cycles could be used it should be recognized that 1 more time is used for adsorption resulting in lower volumes of product per unit time per electrode and 2 water recovery is low as it is the product of the water recovery achieved in each sequential treatment cycle although different influent rates in the adsorption and desorption stages can be proposed with a lower influent rates for the desorption stage this is not practical in the pilot plant described here one significant barrier is that pumps usually achieve optimum performance at a given pressure and flow rate and cycling between operating points increases energy consumption and takes significant time in the pilot plant the desorption duration is not much longer than the response time required for the pump to cycle between different flow rates this frequent change of flow will increase the power consumption of the pump since operation in accelerating or decelerating mode is particularly energy intensive additionally a decision must be reached with regard to the most appropriate pump flow and charging current as the pump uses more energy at higher flow rates reducing the pump flow should be first to be considered this will lead to the δtds line in fig 3 a shifting upwards with faster flow rate or downwards with slower flow these calculations will enable the range of achievable δtds to be subsequently determined the influent rate should be adjusted to a value at which the final tds is lower than the product tds and can be achieved with intermediate or low charging current 100 150 a this helps minimize the overall system power consumption moreover if the final tds is lower than the required tds feed water can be directly mixed with product water to achieve the required tds which will further reduce the system energy usage the relationship between charging current and influent flow rate for single treatment options is provided by equation 11 m salt is the mass of salt to be removed v product is the product volume i ch mcdi is the charging current to mcdi cells q is the flow rate and k 1 are coefficients to be determined by experiments the results shown in fig 3 validate the relationships described by this equation with change in tds proportional to charging current and inversely proportional to flow rate this relationship enables determination of the values of the parameters required to achieve the target product tds or delta tds with results showing that a slow influent rate is more effective than increasing the charging current in terms of achieving greater change of tds 11 δ t d s m s a l t v p r o d u c t k 1 i c h m c d i q 4 5 comparison with other water treatment technologies the results obtained are provided in tables 1 and 2 and enable comparison of mcdi with other solar powered technologies for brackish water desalination recently reported results for water treatment plants of similar scale include both ro bian et al 2016 elasaad et al 2015 lakeh et al 2017 and electrodialysis wright and winter 2017 a comparison of mcdi with these technologies is provided in table 3 the ro system reported by bian et al 2016 and the edr system by wright and winter 2017 have outstanding salt removal performance though the former has a low water recovery and the energy consumption of the latter is unknown the specific energy consumption of the mcdi pilot plant is the most competitive of the three techniques several potential advantages of mcdi technology should also be considered firstly energy stored in mcdi electrodes can be recovered and recycled with this process reducing the total energy consumption by the pilot plant by at least 30 such a reduction in energy usage makes mcdi more energy competitive than the other technologies secondly mcdi technology can achieve water recovery rates higher than 80 which is difficult to achieve using ro although a maximum water recovery of 73 2 is reported for the prototype plant used in this study alternate advanced desorption methods may be used to achieve water recoveries in excess of 80 thirdly simple and accurate control of product conductivity in mcdi can be achieved by adjusting the electrode charging current this control mode simplifies the system and consequently reduces system cost finally the mcdi technique is flexible as the process can be adjusted to suit the required feed water and product tds and accommodate variable energy sources such as renewables taking all these aspects into consideration mcdi technology using a single electrode is shown to be superior to other technologies in cost effectively achieving the water quantity and quality targets specified in this study specifically the pv powered mcdi system described here offers a potential solution for desalination of brackish waters at the scale of 5 m3 day and change of tds of around 800 mg l with a single electrode 5 conclusions the possibility of designing and powering mcdi technology with photovoltaic pv panels coupled with battery storage has been investigated here using a prototype system capable of electrode charging currents in excess of 100 a and product volumes on the order of 5 m3 day guidelines for the design of systems able to operate for 24 h without grid connection are provided the energy consumption of an mcdi prototype plant with various influent flow rates and charging currents has been evaluated and the relationship between these parameters explored such that an in built system controller could be used to dynamically adjust the operating conditions of the processd so as to increase the system operation time comparison against other desalination technologies suggests that mcdi is competitive for applications where pv battery are the only source of energy the system performance can be further enhanced by improved optimization system construction and advanced water

capacitive deionization solar battery renewable energy 1 introduction with greater water scarcity caused by increasing population rapid industrialization widespread water pollution and global climate change desalination has emerged as a critical process in maintaining adequate water supply desalination involves the use of a water treatment technology to produce freshwater from either seawater or brackish groundwater and is becoming more widespread in response to increasing global water deficiency elimelech and phillip 2011 ghaffour et al 2013 capacitive deionization cdi as a promising alternative to classical desalination technologies such as reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed and distillation is attracting increasing attention and has progressed enormously in recent years given the potential for energy efficient and cost effective treatment especially for brackish waters almarzooqi et al 2014 oren 2008 pekala et al 1998 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 cdi is an electrochemical technology that typically involves use of porous carbon electrodes for ion removal from aqueous solutions during charging of electrode pairs ions are adsorbed into electrical double layers edl in the pore space of the carbon lowering the salinity of the influent stream the charging step is followed by a discharging step with the ions being desorbed from the electrodes into a waste stream with the resultant high concentration solution either discarded as waste or reused in some manner generally the adsorption desorption cycles involve reversible electrostatic interactions with the charged electrode pairs acting as a capacitor in which energy is stored work is done in forcing the oppositely charged ion pairs apart and accumulating these ions in the electrodes with the separation of ions accounting for the increase in potential energy in the system during the charging step when discharged a portion of the energy stored in the electrical double layers during adsorption can be recovered during desorption długołęcki and van der wal 2013 kang et al 2016 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 zhao et al 2013a a major development in cdi technology in recent years has been the inclusion of ion exchange membranes on the separator side of each electrode with an anion exchange membrane placed adjacent to the anode and a cation exchange membrane placed adjacent to the cathode membrane capacitive deionization mcdi results in enhanced performance with the membranes allowing for counter ion transport from the spacer channel into the electrode while preventing co

pv battery in this section we provide a procedure for the design of an mcdi plant powered by pv modules and a battery system as shown in fig 1 critically due to the limited input energy from the pv modules reducing the system energy consumption and increasing efficiency is imperative to assist in achieving this during the desorption step in which salt is released the electrode terminals are simply short circuited together rather than reverse charging of the electrodes as the latter consumes additional energy the disadvantage of this approach is that desorption duration is prolonged however this can be improved by advanced desorption methods which are not the focus of this study and possibly by varying the influent rates during the adsorption and desorption steps in this study the influent rates are constant during the process required specifications are the total dissolved solids tds of the feed water and the resultant product and the target product volume which determines the pump flow rate hence pump power the power requirement of the ancillary equipment also needs to be included in the energy analysis essential parameters of the design are the charging current of the mcdi electrode s and the total average input power from the pv system to the plant the outputs from the design procedure are the number of pv panels the battery size and number and the electrode charging current these various parameters are color coded in the flowchart provided in fig 1 where the design procedure is divided into four boxes calculating electrode charging current dashed boxes 1 and 2 sizing of pv panels dashed box 3 and sizing of batteries dashed box 4 the total required charge for the electrode q mcdi in coulombs provided by the power supply and the total charging time t ads day in seconds is essential in determining the average input current to the electrode s in dashed box 1 q mcdi is obtained by calculating the amount of salt to be removed the given product volume v prod in liters and the desired change of tds δtds in mg l i e the differential conductivity between that of feed water and of product charge efficiency should be taken into account η mcdi and 0 8 is assumed here a value for q mcdi can be determined from equation 1 1 q m c d i v p r o d δ t d s m o l s a l t f 1 η m c d i where f is faraday s constant and mol salt is the molar mass of the treated salt in dashed box 2 to obtain the total charge time or the total adsorption time t ads day during one day the duration of the adsorption step t ads in seconds the desorption step t des in seconds and the duration of the full cycle should be pre determined logically with the constant influent flow rate t des should be shorter than t ads if adequate water recovery is to be achieved as water recovery is t ads t des t ads if for example t des 0 5 t ads in theory a water recovery of 67 would result hence the water recovery in a constant flow rate system is approximately determined by the ratio of t des and t ads to estimate t des the electrode cell can be modelled electrically as a resistor capacitor discharge circuit with a time constant ᴦ given by the product of circuit resistance r and capacitance c ᴦ rc if t des is set to half of the time constant t des 0 5 ᴦ then the energy discharged from the cell during t des is approximately 60 of the stored electrostatic energy in the cell at the termination of t ads in such a case t ads would then be ᴦ these relationships highlight the inter dependencies between the electrical and hydraulic aspects of the system as t des is decreased water recovery improves energy consumption per unit of treated influent decreases and the product rate increases r is dominated by the circuit resistance external to the electrode terminals e g line resistance contact resistance since the internal resistance of the electrode is recognized to be much smaller than the external resistance in high charging current i e greater than 100 a applications the external resistance needs to be kept as low as possible in the order of mω to minimize ohmic power losses and prevent material damage due to high temperatures the capacitance of the electrode can be estimated by applying a constant charging current and measuring the change in cell voltage the total adsorption time t ads day in seconds during one day can be obtained from the formula 2 t a d s d a y t a d s t a d s t d e s t s t b 3600 24 where t stb is the duration of the standby period between adsorption and desorption steps and accounts for the time required to transport the water out of the electrode the electrodes are electrically disconnected during the standby step with the duration of this step suggested to be no longer than 1 10 of the full cycle time as it will reduce the utilization of the electrode the volume of the electrode and influent flow rate can also provide guidance in choosing the standby time t stb from equations 1 and 2 the total average input current i ch mcdi tot to the electrode is 3 i c h m c d i t o t q m c d i t a d s d a y i c h m c d i i c h m c d i t o t n where i ch mcdi tot is the current required for daily salt removal this value can be higher than the maximum input current of a single electrode indicating that multiple electrodes n or multiple treatment steps may be necessary in achieving salt removal and treated water volume goals in view of the appropriate input current to a single mcdi electrode i ch mcdi total average input power p in plant in kilo watts to the mcdi electrode should be calculated before a decision is reached on the number of pv modules and the battery capacity and number required the type of batteries for the plant should be determined so that the voltage at a certain depth of charge dod in percentage is known this voltage will be used in calculating the battery discharge current which is critical in terms of battery lifetime in dashed box 2 the peak sun hours can be obtained from meteorological records in the case study described here these were recorded by the australian bureau of meteorology bom we suggest the use of peak sun hours averaged over a year hours avg peak sun in hours for the design rather than minimum or maximum hours the use of minimum peak sun hours would result in an oversized surface area of pv panels significantly increasing the system size and leading to energy curtailment from pv panels in summer concomitantly a design based on maximum sun hours would lead to fewer pv panels and lower capacity batteries potentially leading to a significant energy shortage in winter once the average peak sun hours have been determined the total output power of the pv panels p pv total in kilo watts can be estimated the number of pv panels n pvpanels required can thus be

materials and equipment in accordance with the system design procedure described above an mcdi pilot plant powered by a pv battery system for 24 h operation was designed and tested the potential applications of this plant include i provision of drinking water by treating brackish water for remote communities where grid electricity is either not provided is unreliable or is too expensive and ii provision of irrigation water for high value crops while the source water quality and treated volume required may differ from case to case we assume for the purposes of this study that the tds of feed water is around 1200 mg l and that product demand is less than 10 m3 day specifically the design of the prototype unit described below is based around a target δtds of 800 mg l and product volume of 5 m3 day the mcdi units model c 17 22 fcld rg used in the plant are from voltea b v the netherlands these units are cylindrical with a diameter of 28 cm and a height of 70 cm and can hold 11 l water the range of input current and voltage is 0 400 a and 0 2 v respectively at ambient temperature the flow rate range can be 0 1 1 3 m3 hour and the cells have a maximum rated pressure of 10 bar 3 1 1 mcdi electrode the total electrode charge required is related to the mass of salt to be removed and can be calculated using the change of conductivity and product volume in this study nacl of molar mass 58 44 g mol was used as the target species according to equation 1 the required charge q mcdi for one day of operation was 8 26 106 c with 100 a constant current applied to the electrode the rate of change of voltage provides an estimate of the capacitance of the electrode with the electrode capacitance for the prototype system described here estimated at 4 5 104 f the power supply output voltage and the terminal voltage across the electrode were measured enabling an estimate of the total external resistance of 4 1 mω determined by dividing the voltage difference between the power supply and electrode terminals by the charging current the time constant ᴦ can then be calculated and was equal to 184 5 s indicating that the duration of the desorption step t des should be 92 25 s as described in section 2 if the adsorption duration is twice that of the desorption time to preserve reasonable water recovery rates then t ads is equal to 184 5 s in light of these calculations 180 s was used for adsorption t ads 95 s for desorption t des and 25 s in total for the standby stage i e each t stb 12 5 s resulting in a full cycle time of 300 s using equation 2 the total adsorption time t ads day was determined to be 51 840 s 14 4 h per day and the total average charging current i ch mcdi tot to the mcdi electrodes was 159 3 a this current was considered to be in the range of the input current of one mcdi electrode and as such n in equation 3 was set to 1 thus in summary the plant only requires a single electrode with charging current i ch mcdi of 159 3 a to achieve the specified treated volume at the required change in conductivity the final voltage of the electrode in the adsorption step v ads was set at 1 3 v bouhadana et al 2010 choi 2014 as the adsorption time is 180 s this means the initial electrode voltage v des is 0 66 v in steady operation with the assumption that the electrode is a 4 5 104 f ideal capacitor for a linear increase of the cell voltage during the adsorption step the average voltage of the electrode v mcdi is 0 98 v 0 5 v des v ads 3 1 2 total input power of the mcdi plant before calculating the total input power using equation 6 where p ancillary in kilo watts is the ancillary equipment power consumption the voltage and the type of batteries to be used should be determined 12 v was employed for the supply voltage level of the plant to enable the incorporation of single stage bi directional converter circuits valve regulated lead acid vrla gel batteries were considered most appropriate as this type of battery requires less maintenance and is well suited to the cyclic discharge and energy storage required of pv systems 6 p t o t a l p i n m c d i p p u m p p a n c i l l a r y battery voltage decreases over

the number and depth of charge recharge cycles from the data sheet of the chosen family of batteries the voltage at 50 of dod is 12 2 v the energy consumption of the power supply associated with the electrode was included in the energy usage by using a conservative efficiency of 70 for the electrode power supply η conv the total input power to the mcdi p in mcdi was calculated to be 0 134 kw using equation 7 7 p i n m c d i t a d s i c h m c d i v m c d i t a d s t d e s t s d b 1 η c o n v 1 1000 the pump also consumes energy with the power consumption p pump varying with flow rate the flow rate was determined from the required product volume 5 m3 day and the water recovery assumed here to be a modest 60 with these constraints the required influent flow rate was 5 76 l per minute lpm a 12 v dc pump was selected with open flow rate of 18 9 lpm the pump flow was adjusted by varying its supply voltage via a voltage controller according to the pump characteristics the power consumption of the pump was 0 04 kw considering the efficiency of the pump voltage controller 80 0 05 kw was used for the pump input power the power required to operate ancillary equipment including micro controller valves and relays with line losses taken into account was measured at 0 06 kw consequently the total input power of the plant which is the sum of the input power of the mcdi electrode the pump and the ancillary equipment was 0 244 kw resulting in a total energy requirement for the mcdi plant over one day of 5 86 kwh 3 1 3 pv panels as indicated in section 2 information on peak sun

equation 4 p pv total is determined to be 0 976 kw hence three 310 w peak power pv panels were chosen for provision of power to the plant 3 1 4 batteries the average discharge current i dis batt of

chose to use two 300 ah batteries in parallel sharing the discharge current i e each battery delivers 10 a considering the plant economics and available space in the unit according to the charge and discharge curves in the battery datasheet two batteries would supply the rated current for 15 h before the voltage dropped to 12 2 v indicating a dod of 50 by adjusting the load such as by lowering the pump flow rate during the night the batteries would be able to provide continuous supply until the next charging cycle commences 3 2 materials and equipment a 12 v dc diaphragm pump model sfdp1 050 060 51 from seaflo open flow rate is 18 9 l per minute lpm was employed to pump the water through the pre treatment and mcdi columns the relationship between the flow rate voltage and power of the

dc 300 ah valve regulated lead acid gel batteries 12 eg 300 endurogel were used for energy storage a flexmax 60 outback power charge controller with a maximum output current of 60 a was used to process the energy between the pv panels and the storage batteries tracking the maximum power point and converting the pv output to a suitable voltage for charging the batteries a system display and controller mate3 outback power was used to monitor and record information from the charge controller data related to the pv battery system in this study were obtained from this controller including pv voltage battery current energy converted from the pv panels in kwh and ampere hours supplied to the batteries a switched mode dc dc converter designed to supply the electrode from the 12 v supply was used in this study the input voltage of the converter ranged from 4 5 v to 16 v with output voltage of up to 2 1 v and output dc current of up to 200 a the efficiency of the dc dc converters was above 85 in step down mode when the input voltage was 12 v output voltage was 1 0 v and output current ranged between 55 a and 200 a 3 3 experimental setup the electrical schematic of the mcdi plant is shown in fig 2 a three pv panels were the only source of energy for the treatment plant the maximum power point tracking mppt charge controller flexmax60 converted the higher voltage dc supply from the pv panels to 12 14 v dc for charging of the batteries during daylight the plant was driven by energy generated by the pv panels with excess electrical energy stored in the batteries during the period when there was little or no solar irradiance the plant was powered primarily from the batteries relay 1 was a high current relay 350 a used to connect disconnect the electrode to from the dc dc power supply relay 2 also a high current relay was used to short circuit the electrode in the desorption step the plant was installed in an enclosure such that the pv panels were used as a canopy providing modest shade the plant could then be orientated to maximize the solar irradiance during daylight for this study the panels were mounted on the roof of a building to maximize solar exposure in the heavily built up environment a schematic of the mcdi prototype is shown in fig 2 b the possibility existed of placing additional electrodes in parallel hydraulically to enhance the production although only one electrode was used in this study a single pass approach was used in all studies described here with the influent sourced from a feed tank with the product and waste streams separated into their respective tanks the influent was pumped at a constant flow rate through the mcdi electrode and a constant but adjustable electrode current was used to adsorb the ions in the influent via electrosorption onto the carbon electrodes when the voltage across the terminals reached the set point voltage of 1 3 v bouhadana et al 2010 choi 2014 the charging current was turned off and the power supply was disconnected from the electrode a standby stage during which the electrode was electrically disconnected from the power supply and the pump continued running enabled the treated water remaining in the electrode to be removed a 12 5 s standby stage between the adsorption and desorption steps is used in the studies described here during the desorption step the mcdi cell terminals were short circuited discharging the electrosorbed ions back into the influent channel the duration of the desorption step was 95 s as explained in section 3 1 1 the influent and effluent conductivity and voltage across the terminals of the mcdi column were recorded using two conductivity probes con bta vernier corp usa and a voltage probe vp bta vernier corp usa to measure power consumption a lecroy waverunner 64xi oscilloscope with voltage probe and current probe lecroy cp500 attachments was used in all cases results were shown as an average of three steady state cycles i e cycles which repeat almost unchanged for investigative purposes only an influent solution containing 4000 mg l of nacl was used in the prototype studies the performance of the unit was assessed for various constant charging currents between 100 and 200 a factors underpinning choice of applied current were presented in section 3 1 1 for influent flow rates of 3 12 lpm subsequently the energy consumption during operation and the desalting performance of the mcdi unit were analyzed in order to provide information on energy costs for larger scale systems the water recovery in the studies described here is calculated as follows 8 water recovery v p r o d v t 100 where v prod and v t l are the volume of treated water produced in one cycle and the total water used in one cycle respectively the product was defined as the treated water with conductivity lower than the feed water in the adsorption step and the following standby step and was collected in the product tank the remainder of the water not collected in the product tank was defined as waste the specific ion j adsorption per cycle n j mol is derived by integrating the difference between the effluent concentration c j eff mm and the influent concentration c j inf mm over time s t 0 t ads and multiplying by the flow rate q m3 s 1 the expression nj is given by the integral 9 n j q t 0 t a d s c j e f f c j inf d t the current efficiency ce of the system defined as the ratio of the charge of ions removed from the influent to the charge inserted into the electrode is given by the expression 10 c e n j n a q e t 0 t a d s i d t where n a is avogadro s constant and q e is the electron charge 4 results and discussion 4 1 operation of the mcdi electrode experiments were undertaken using the prototype in order to explore the energy consumption of the plant operating under various conditions in these experiments termination of the adsorption step was determined solely by the electrode terminal voltage reaching the set point voltage of 1 3 v the desorption period was fixed at 95 s and the standby step at 12 5 s moreover a flow rate of 5 22 lpm was used with this value lower than the original design flow rate of 5 76 lpm as such it is expected that the change of conductivity will be marginally different from the design performance results for different electrode charging currents at the same constant flow rate 5 22 lpm are shown in table 1 the charge efficiency defined in equation 10 and presented in table 1 indicates that the assumptions made for equation 1 are reasonable based on the linear regression fit through the experimental data a change of conductivity of 800 mg l can be achieved for a charging current of 136 a and an adsorption period of 214 4 s this charging current is slightly lower than the original design current for removal of 800 mg l of salt because the flow rate is slightly lower than design grey marker in fig 3 a for a constant flow rate increasing the charging current proportionally increases the change in effluent concentration fig 3 a zhao et al 2012 as ion electrosorption per cycle is independent of the charging current with this size of electrode the cause of the greater change in ion concentration is due to the duration of the charging stage the volume of product decreases when the charging current increases as less time is required to reach the 1 3 v adsorption termination voltage thereby resulting in lower product volumes given a fixed flow rate high electrode charging currents were demonstrated to result in poor treatment efficiency firstly the higher current results in rapid extraction of ions from solution with the result that the resistance of the aqueous stream in the electrode rises quickly leading to a shorter time for the electrode to reach its end voltage secondly as the desorption time is fixed to a factor of the electrical time constant of the shorted electrode shorter adsorption times mean less treated water is produced resulting in lower water recovery in agreement with previous work zhao et al 2013a results obtained with constant electrode charging current 150 a and different influent flow rates are shown in table 2 with key results plotted in fig 3 b the adsorption durations of the four tests were almost identical with the electrode consuming similar amounts of energy in each case additionally similar total salt removal figures were observed in each case with the change in salt concentration approximately inversely proportional to the flow rate the performance of the electrode when different influent conductivities were used is shown in fig 4 the charging current for these studies was set at 150 a and the flow rate at 5 lpm the feed conductivities of the three experiments were 3314 mg l 2384 mg l and 1560 mg l respectively the upper traces show the electrode terminal voltage while the lower traces show the conductivities measured at the outlet of the electrode as can be seen from fig 4 the voltage linearly increases during the adsorption step which verifies the assumption made in the design procedures that the electrode may be treated as a capacitor the durations of the adsorption steps vary slightly as a result of the small differences in the end voltages importantly it can be seen from fig 4 that the change in tds is consistently above 900 mg l this demonstrates that the feed water salt concentration at levels higher than 1000 mg l has little influence on the change in tds when the charging current and the flow rate are kept constant as such once the electrode charging current and influent flow rate are decided it should be possible to reliably predict the expected product quality the results of the studies described here indicate that 1 tds changes linearly with the electrode charging current when the influent flow rate is fixed 2 tds changes inversely with the influent flow rate when the charging current is fixed and 3 product volume changes linearly with influent flow rate using this information and equations 1 7 system energy usage can be predicted given a particular flow rate and electrode charging current as a consequence the system controller can be used to calculate in real time the appropriate load for the batteries according to the input power from the pv panels and time of the day required to achieve best operational performance 4 2 energy usage of components in the mcdi plant the hourly energy usage of the mcdi plant and subcomponents under different charging currents and different influent rates is illustrated in fig 5 the energy consumption of the pump was measured and the voltage controller that operates the pump had an efficiency of 80 the ancillary equipment consumed a constant 60 w representing 0 06 kwh of energy usage per hour the energy usage of major components is shown in fig 5 a when influent rate is constant at 5 22 lpm and the charging current is varied pump and ancillary equipment were seen to consume a similar amount of energy to the mcdi electrode the results presented in fig 5 b show that when influent rate increases the energy consumption of the pump significantly increases and becomes higher than the energy used by the mcdi electrode desalination using mcdi electrodes only requires low pressure feed water the pre treatment filters increase the required system pressure by 2 bar leading to higher power consumption by the pump at an appropriate scale there is merit in separating the pre treatment stage from the mcdi plant if system energy consumption is to be reduced especially when the input energy is limited attention should also be paid to the performance at high influent flow rates since energy usage of the pump dramatically increases with flow rate as can be seen from fig 5 b when the flow is 12 lpm energy usage of other equipment is 50 higher than that of the electrode resulting in elevated energy use additionally the change of tds is low when the influent flow is high i e if high change of tds or low product tds is required then the flow rate through each electrode must be kept low a configuration with hydraulically parallel electrodes with slow influent flow to each electrode should be considered if the target performance cannot be met with a single electrode recovery of energy from the electrode with subsequent storage in the battery during the desorption stage was also investigated in this study previous studies were limited in scale and did not involve battery recharge długołęcki and van der wal 2013 fig 6 shows a full cycle of operation of the mcdi electrode with a bi directional dc dc converter used for recovering the electrode energy to the batteries during the desorption step the charging and discharge current in the adsorption and desorption step was 120 a the desorption termination voltage was set at the start voltage of the adsorption step in order to assess the recoverable energy in the electrode during the desorption step the energy used to charge the electrode in the adsorption step was determined to be 26 0 kj during the desorption step 16 1 kj could be recovered when the end voltage was the same as the end voltage for a 95 s short circuit desorption which represents 62 of the energy used in the adsorption step during the first 95 s of desorption with energy recovery 10 5 kj 40 of the total input energy was recovered consequently the energy usage of the mcdi electrode listed in tables 1 and 2 can be reduced conservatively by 30 making allowances for losses in the converter circuit 4 3 energy budget in the study described here the total converted solar energy during good insolation days was above 5 3 kwh while on poorer days this dropped to 3 kwh based on the efficiency and the total surface area of the three pv panels the average solar exposure was determined to be 2 89 kwh m 2 the 5 3 kwh produced in winter when peak sun hours are minimum was 91 of the energy requirements of the plant 5 86 kwh with this result indicating that the plant will have enough energy on average from the pv panels most of the year this result demonstrates the robustness of the guidelines described earlier with respect to choice of pv panels when the daily input energy from the pv panels is not sufficient the plant can adopt a lower energy plan which can be achieved by reducing the electrode charging current or the influent flow rate to realize 24 h operation the tests were performed in winter when demand for product water is likely to be lower than in other seasons so lowering the product rate may be acceptable in other seasons the power derived from the photovoltaic panels should be more than sufficient to allow for 24 h operation at 5 lpm influent flow rate and an 800 mg l change in salt concentration fig 7 shows the output current from the charge controller and the battery voltage for a cloudy day 24 05 2018 and a sunny day 31 05 2018 with 25 a of battery discharge current the time resolution is 10 s by 0900 the solar panels are fully exposed to sunlight and the output current rises to 40 a once the charge controller detects sunlight in the afternoon around 1430 the current falls below 40 a giving peak sun hours of 5 5 h both sub figures in fig 7 show that when being charged the battery voltage reaches 13 5 v and remains at this voltage as the battery state of charge is greater than 80 if the output current from the charge controller is higher than the unit consumption the batteries will be charged otherwise the batteries will discharge this means the process controller should dynamically adjust the load so that the plant can preserve energy and operate for a longer time fig 7 b shows that strong and constant solar exposure can provide enough energy for powering the mcdi operation with excess energy to charge the batteries hence the battery voltage does not fall much until the peak sun hour period ends subsequently the controller should adjust the load such that the batteries are able to support the plant to operate in excess of 20 h 4 4 optimum operation of the mcdi plant operation of mcdi plants especially for those with a limited supply of energy should be optimized to reduce system capital cost and energy usage this is imperative in scenarios where larger changes of tds are required in this section the optimum operational principles for pv powered mcdi plants are discussed the mcdi cells should ideally be configured such that the final product is obtained from feed water with only one treatment hence all the employed cells only process feed water and produce the final product with one adsorption step as shown in fig 4 b while multiple sequential adsorption cycles could be used it should be recognized that 1 more time is used for adsorption resulting in lower volumes of product per unit time per electrode and 2 water recovery is low as it is the product of the water recovery achieved in each sequential treatment cycle although different influent rates in the adsorption and desorption stages can be proposed with a lower influent rates for the desorption stage this is not practical in the pilot plant described here one significant barrier is that pumps usually achieve optimum performance at a given pressure and flow rate and cycling between operating points increases energy consumption and takes significant time in the pilot plant the desorption duration is not much longer than the response time required for the pump to cycle between different flow rates this frequent change of flow will increase the power consumption of the pump since operation in accelerating or decelerating mode is particularly energy intensive additionally a decision must be reached with regard to the most appropriate pump flow and charging current as the pump uses more energy at higher flow rates reducing the pump flow should be first to be considered this will lead to the δtds line in fig 3 a shifting upwards with faster flow rate or downwards with slower flow these calculations will enable the range of achievable δtds to be subsequently determined the influent rate should be adjusted to a value at which the final tds is lower than the product tds and can be achieved with intermediate or low charging current 100 150 a this helps minimize the overall system power consumption moreover if the final tds is lower than the required tds feed water can be directly mixed with product water to achieve the required tds which will further reduce the system energy usage the relationship between charging current and influent flow rate for single treatment options is provided by equation 11 m salt is the mass of salt to be removed v product is the product volume i ch mcdi is the charging current to mcdi cells q is the flow rate and k 1 are coefficients to be determined by experiments the results shown in fig 3 validate the relationships described by this equation with change in tds proportional to charging current and inversely proportional to flow rate this relationship enables determination of the values of the parameters required to achieve the target product tds or delta tds with results showing that a slow influent rate is more effective than increasing the charging current in terms of achieving greater change of tds 11 δ t d s m s a l t v p r o d u c t k 1 i c h m c d i q 4 5 comparison with other water treatment technologies the results obtained are provided in tables 1 and 2 and enable comparison of mcdi with other solar powered technologies for brackish water desalination recently reported results for water treatment plants of similar scale include both ro bian et al 2016 elasaad et al 2015 lakeh et al 2017 and electrodialysis wright and winter 2017 a comparison of mcdi with these technologies is provided in table 3 the ro system reported by bian et al 2016 and the edr system by wright and winter 2017 have outstanding salt removal performance though the former has a low water recovery and the energy consumption of the latter is unknown the specific energy consumption of the mcdi pilot plant is the most competitive of the three techniques several potential advantages of mcdi technology should also be considered firstly energy stored in mcdi electrodes can be recovered and recycled with this process reducing the total energy consumption by the pilot plant by at least 30 such a reduction in energy usage makes mcdi more energy competitive than the other technologies secondly mcdi technology can achieve water recovery rates higher than 80 which is difficult to achieve using ro although a maximum water recovery of 73 2 is reported for the prototype plant used in this study alternate advanced desorption methods may be used to achieve water recoveries in excess of 80 thirdly simple and accurate control of product conductivity in mcdi can be achieved by adjusting the electrode charging current this control mode simplifies the system and consequently reduces system cost finally the mcdi technique is flexible as the process can be adjusted to suit the required feed water and product tds and accommodate variable energy sources such as renewables taking all these aspects into consideration mcdi technology using a single electrode is shown to be superior to other technologies in cost effectively achieving the water quantity and quality targets specified in this study specifically the pv powered mcdi system described here offers a potential solution for desalination of brackish waters at the scale of 5 m3 day and change of tds of around 800 mg l with a single electrode 5 conclusions the possibility of designing and powering mcdi technology with photovoltaic pv panels coupled with battery storage has been investigated here using a prototype system capable of electrode charging currents in excess of 100 a and product volumes on the order of 5 m3 day guidelines for the design of systems able to operate for 24 h without grid connection are provided the energy consumption of an mcdi prototype plant with various influent flow rates and charging currents has been evaluated and the relationship between these parameters explored such that an in built system controller could be used to dynamically adjust the operating conditions of the processd so as to increase the system operation time comparison against other desalination technologies suggests that mcdi is competitive for applications where pv battery are the only source of energy the system performance can be further enhanced by improved optimization system construction and advanced water

19251,this work investigated the long term stability of aerobic granular sludge treating high strength organic wastewater in a semi pilot scale sequential batch reactor sbr the reactor was operated for 316 days under different operational conditions it was found that the f m ratio is an important parameter affecting granules formation and stability three selection mechanisms were investigated 1 cultivation and maturation at moderately high influent cod concentration 2500 mg l followed by increase in influent cod concentration to 7500 mg l 2 stressed cultivation and operation at high influent cod concentration of 4500 mg l and 3 alternate feed loading strategy variable influent cod concentration across the daily schedule of cycles at 50 75 and 100 of the peak concentration of 5000 mg l it was found that adopting high olr at the reactor start up accelerated the formation of granules however the overgrowth of biomass under high organics concentration negatively affected the stability of granules and led to disintegration due to the presence of methanogens in the granule core cultivation at high organics concentration resulted in a rapid loss of microbial diversity and reactor failure under alternate feed loading adequate selection of microbial community was maintained and resulted in stable reactor performance moreover a strong correlation between f m ratio and the granules settling ability was observed when f m ratio exceeded 1 5 gcod gss d granules showed poor settleability and under very high sludge loading rates above 2 5 sludge bulking occurred and led to washout of sludge due to the strong selection pressure of short settling time operating the reactor at f m ratio of 0 5 1 4 gcod gss d appears to favor stable long term granule stability graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge food to microorganism ratio high strength organic wastewater microbial diversity wastewater treatment 1 introduction recent developments have favored aerobic granular sludge ags over conventional activated sludge processes cas due to the reactor compact design outstanding settleability the ability of aerobic granules to withstand high organic loading rates olrs and the potential for simultaneous organics and nutrients removal adav et al 2008 while many full scale ags applications have been implemented for the treatment of municipal wastewater it remains less competitive for industrial full scale applications especially for high strength organic wastewaters when compared to high rate anaerobic reactors such as the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb mainly due to the operational costs required for ags and the mass transfer limitations at olrs 5 7 kg m3 d gao et al 2011 however during the last 25 years aerobic granulation has evolved and has proven to be one of the most efficient and well suited biological wastewater treatment technologies for high strength organic wastewater ags overcomes the drawbacks of anaerobic treatment processes such as low growth rates of microorganisms the high sensitivity to toxic loadings low temperatures ph changes fluctuations in environmental conditions the low settling rate of biomass and the need for post treatment of the noxious anaerobic effluent which often contains ammonium ion nh4 and hydrogen sulfide hs chan et al 2009 grady et al 2011 rajeshwari et al 2000 leitão et al 2006 moreover the effluent quality in ags can meet the discharge limits ahammad et al 2013 lópez palau et al 2012 the rapid formation of aerobic granules compared to months in anaerobic granules the good settling ability high biomass retention tolerance to toxicity and resistance to shock loading and the smaller footprint when compared to cas sets ags as a very promising technology for industrial applications for treatment high strength organic wastewater tay et al 2002a lv et al 2014 show et al 2012 ivanov et al 2006 abdullah et al 2013 moy et al 2002 show et al 2012 2012 liu et al 2015 kocaturk and erguder 2016 adav et al 2010 long et al 2015 however granule disintegration remains an unresolved problem of the ags technology sarma et al 2017 several theories have been put forward for the formation of ags including the essential role of hydrodynamic shear force liu and tay 2002 short settling time adav et al 2009 liu and tay 2004 and intermittent feast famine conditions or periodic starvation and its effect on cell hydrophobicity lópez palau et al 2012 beun et al 2002 tay et al 2001 selection for slow growing organisms such as phosphate or glycogen accumulating bacteria was proposed for maintaining granule stability de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 reasons behind granule instability and disintegration were also studied and attributed to many factors such as proliferation of filamentous bacteria at high substrate loading rates moy et al 2002 liu and liu 2006 liu et al 2007 liu and tay 2012 anaerobic fermentation of dead and lysed cells in large sized granules tay et al 2002a 2002b ivanov et al 2005 lv et al 2014 and destruction in the structure of extracellular polymeric substances eps with proteins pn playing an essential role in granule stability long et al 2015 unlike cas the absence of decisive operating parameters for a stable and reliable operation of ags reactor remains the key challenge impeding the full scale industrial application of ags the majority of research on ags was conducted for a short operational period in addition although various theories have been proposed for reactor instability little emphasis was given to process optimization and the link between the engineering aspects and the underlying fundamental microbiology current knowledge of the different operating strategies focused on olr as a critical operating parameter where aerobic granulation has been reported to withstand olr up to 15 kg chemical oxygen demand cod m3 d in sbrs moy et al 2002 show et al 2012 kocaturk and erguder 2016 and disintegration was reported at olr of 21 3 kg scod m3 at critical cod values for granule disintegration of 3000 4000 mg l due to the decrease in protein productivity by isolates under high olr adav et al 2010 long et al 2015 attributed the loss of stability of aerobic granules at olr of 18 kg m3 d to the increase of the granule size which resulted in the formation of massive dead cells inside the core of the granules causing disintegration of the granular structures anaerobic feeding was adopted to control the size of the granules by favoring the relatively low growth rate of the paos phosphate accumulating organisms or gaos glycogen accumulating organisms bacteria through the conversion of easily biodegradable substrate to storage polymers to be used during the aerobic phase and thus maintain a relatively low growth rate favoring the granule stability pronk et al 2015 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 in the absence of anaerobic feeding alternating feast and famine conditions was believed to play a key role in granule stability during the feast period the organic matter is oxidized and stored inside bacterial cells as poly hydroxyalkanoates phas while during the famine period the bacteria grow on the stored compounds periodic starvation with famine period lasting twice longer than feast period was found to have a strong effect on cell hydrophobicity lópez palau et al 2012 and can enhance granule stability liu et al 2016a recent studies highlighted the impact of f m ratio on granule stability and established a ratio of 0 4 0 5 gcod gss d for achieving stable granules with good settleability high pollutant removal efficiency and microbial diversity wu et al 2018 food to microorganisms f m ratio is a key practical parameter that has been studied in cas processes jenkins et al 2003 f m ratio is defined as the load of substrate applied per day per unit biomass in the reactor f m is usually in the range of 0 25 0 5 kg bod kg mlvss d for cas and uasb and 0 07 0 15 kg bod kg mlvss d in extended aeration metcalf and eddy 2014 sperling 2007 at high f m ratios the floc forming bacteria dominate over filamentous bacteria due to their ability to assimilate high load of substrate compared to the filamentous bacteria sperling 2007 however high f m ratio can result in surplus substrate in the effluent as the biodegradable organic matter exceeds the consumption capacity of the biomass in the system high solids retention times srts are associated with low f m values and vice versa where an optimum srt for good bioflocculation and low effluent cod was found to be in the range of 2 8 days rittmann 1987 the procedure to control f m ratio in cas is by adjusting the solids concentration through manipulating either the return activated sludge ras or waste sludge or both in accordance with the influent substrate load most current ags applications are in a sequential batch reactor sbr mode where the clarifier is eliminated and a settling phase is included in the reactor operation schedule thus a ras line is not applicable and the reactor operation relies on the amount of biomass retained in the reactor after decanting such selection mechanism determines the biomass concentration as well as microbial species in the reactor and thus controls the f m ratio theoretically an infinite srt sludge age can be attained however the washout dynamics of the biomass at the decant level plays a decisive role on both the microbial population retained in the reactor as well as the srt as demonstrated by liu et al 2016b where the selection pressure created by hrt and srt on aerobic granulation was negligible when compared to the selection pressure from short settling time moreover it was highlighted that the microbial population shift was observed mainly during reactor startup first 6 days due to the washed out sludge which led to difference of microbial community in the reactor and effluent while as the experiment progressed no apparent difference was observed between the microorganisms retained in the reactor and those in the effluent liu et al 2016b in addition in studying the effect of f m ratio on ags in sbr it is challenging to avoid the interference with the hydraulic selection pressure mainly the settling velocity determined by the settling time li et al 2008a b found that in contrast to cas ags in sbr is unlikely dependent on srt and that granulation was not attained at all the studied srts 3 40 days in the absence of a strong hydraulic selection pressure however the long term system performance was not investigated furthermore in most studies on ags the reactors were operated at f m ratios comparable to that of cas 0 13 to 0 29 gcod gss d janga et al 2007 0 33 gcod gss d tay et al 2004 0 2 to 0 4 gcod gss d kang and yuan 2017 li et al 2008a b found that after maturation granules cultivated under different f m ratios 0 3 1 0 4 2 and 6 0 gcod gss d all stabilized at sludge loading rates of 0 5 g cod g ss d li et al 2011 adopted a higher f m ratio of 1 1 gcod gss d in the early stage to stimulate rapid formation and reduced the f m ratio to 0 3 gcod gss d in the later stage to sustain small and healthy granules wu et al 2018 revealed that stable granules with good settleability high pollutant removal efficiency and microbial diversity were achieved when f m ratio was controlled through quantitative sludge discharge at 0 4 0 5 gcod gss d 0 4 0 02 gcod gss d however the stability boundaries of f m ratio in ags are still not clear the long term impact of f m on the dynamics of the microbial population in an ags reactor and process performance is yet to be investigated studies on the microbial community composition and dynamics in ags under different operational conditions and wastewater compositions do not give clear conclusions on the role of the different microbial groups on granule stability and process performance wilén et al 2018 therefore this work aimed at determining the impact of f m ratio on the long term stability of aerobic granules under different operational conditions in order to establish clear stability boundaries of f m ratio in ags reactor treating high strength organics wastewater in addition information currently available in the literature with respect to the favorable operational conditions the dynamics of the microbial population in an ags reactor and process performance are not sufficient for predictable startup and operation of ags reactor for treatment of high strength organics wastewater the study looked at the long term impact of f m on the dynamics of the microbial population and the role of the different microbial groups on granule stability and process performance four main objectives were studied in this work 1 determination of the impact and the statistical significance of f m ratio on the settleability of ags 2 investigation of the effect and the statistical significance of f m ratio on the wash out dynamics microbial selection and population shifts and the relative abundance and function of the microbial community in the reactor 3 determination of the threshold of f m ratio for long term stable operation of ags for the treatment of high strength organics wastewater 4 evaluation of the reactor performance in terms of effluent quality parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up seed sludge and media one cylindrical acrylic reactor with an internal diameter of 150 mm and a working volume of 18 l was used as the sbr for the experiment aeration was provided via fine air bubble diffusers

and effluent withdrawal 2 min the influent fill and effluent withdrawal times were kept constant throughout the experimental period the settling time was decreased from 20 min to 8 min in the cultivation stage first week of operation with the remaining being aeration stage where changes in the cycle time during periods ii and iii was due to extending the aeration period ras from pine creek

schedule of 2 cycles at 5000 mg l 2 cycles at 3750 mg l and 2 cycles at 2500 mg l adjustments to influent nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were implemented throughout the experimental campaign to ensure that nutrients were supplemented to meet the minimal growth requirements hrt was elongated during period ii from 6 h to 6 7 h and iii further to 8 h to ensure complete degradation of cod concentration and the achievement of periodic starvation hamza et al 2018 f m was controlled by regulating olr mlss concentration was dependent on the applied olr and the biomass retained in the reactor i e no sludge discharge was implemented sludge settling properties was chosen as the control parameter where the duration of each experimental phase was determined based on biomass settling properties as expressed in both svi30 and granulation percent expressed as svi30 svi5 during period i cultivation and maturation the goal was to achieve svi30 50 ml g and granulation percent svi30 svi5 90 to ensure excellent granule properties for the experiment during the next phases of the experiment each experiment phase was ended when svi30 increased above 100 ml g or svi30 svi5 dropped

method peterson 1977 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of f m ratio on the settleability of aerobic granules the profiles of f m ratio based on scod and svi are shown in fig 1 a strong correlation was found between f m ratio and sludge settleability represented in svi during startup at influent cod concentration 2 42 0 19 g l and until day 10 of operation the svi showed a fluctuating trend afterwards stable and mature granules dominated the reactor improving the sludge settleability after 30 days period i the svi dropped to below 50 ml gss the biomass continued to show good settling sustaining an svi below 40 ml g until day 90 subsequently the reactor experienced a sharp increase in f m ratio to above 2 3 gcod gss d due to granules disintegration coupled with washout of fluffly flocs under short settling time of 8 min end of period ii on day 106 the cod concentration was decreased to around 4500 mg l period iii and the reactor biomass was augmented with seed sludge 20 v v to restore diversity despite the improvement in sludge settleability along with the decrease in the f m ratio the granular sludge stability was not maintained on day 165 severe bulking was observed the wastewater composition was modified to maintain a cod n ratio of 100 4 to ensure the presence of sufficient nitrogen and seed sludge 20 v v was added however the sludge settleability showed fluctuations followed by washout of biomass mlss dropped to around 4300 mg l on day 217 end of period iii in period iv from day 225 247 the influent cod concentration was reduced to 2 12 0 31 g l to adjust the f m ratio and hence improve sludge settling in period v from day 248 316 the reactor was operated under an alternating feed loading conditions where the influent cod concentration daily schedule was 2 cycles at 5000 mg l 2 cycles at 3750 mg l and 2 cycles at 2500 mg l with an average olr of 11 1 1 5 kg m3 d the reactor showed stable operation at f m ratio between 1 0 and 1 4 gcod gss d and svi below 60 ml g for the 68 days of operation under these conditions a strong statistical correlation was shown between f m ratio and the sludge settleability where at a two tail test α 0 001 the correlation is statistically significant with pearson s correlation coefficient of 0 585 and 0 526 for svi5 and svi30 respectively according to the statistical analysis conducted using spss ibm corp shown in table 2 there was a significant main effect for f m ratio on the settleability of granules svi30 after controlling for the effect of cod n and cod p f 50 32 30 021 p 5 1e 17 curve estimation and regression model showed that an exponential relationship exists between f m ratio and biomass settleability represented in svi the model equation can be written as s v i 23 259 e 0 5221 f m where svi is in ml g and f m is in gcod gss d the goodness of the fit assessed by r squared and the standard error of the regression s was 0 5 and 0 4 respectively the regression analysis showed the significance of the model and the coefficients at α 0 001 it is worth mentioning however that capability of the model for prediction is diminished as f m ratio increases above 2 as shown in fig 2 this can be attributed to the fact that at higher f m ratios the biomass is characterized by the co existence of flocculent as well as granular biomass due to the rapid biomass growth such growth over competed the ability of biomass to aggregate hamza et al 2018 adav et al 2010 indicated that at a cod medium 3000 mg l most functional strains lost capability for auto aggregation and pn or ps productivity therefore the abundance of floccular biomass over granular biomass at high f m shifts the settleability of the biomass towards that of suspended cultures from these results it can be concluded that f m ratio gcod gss d plays an important role in the stability of ags treating high strength organic wastewater to provide a flexible range of operation four groups of f m ratio based on the corresponding actual svi values were identified as shown in fig 3 at f m ratios between 0 5 and 1 0 gcod gss d the mean svi value was 34 8 8 3 ml g from 1 1 to 1 4 gcod gss d the svi increased to 46 9 17 3 ml g from 1 5 to 2 2 gcod gss d the svi further increased to 74 2 23 1 ml g at f m 2 2 gcod gss d svi showed mean value of 119 8 52 8 ml g and the sludge settleability was affected negatively and it was difficult to retain the biomass in the reactor it is worth mentioning that high variability in the svi values as indicated by the standard deviation within each group was observed with the increasing f m ratios at f m ratios between 1 5 and 2 2 the variability was over 30 and such deviation increased to over 40 at f m ratios above 2 2 gcod gss d such variation reflects the instability in granule settleability when subjected to this range of high sludge loading rates moreover the aggregation ability of biomass to form granules becomes diminished reactor failure follows the increase of f m ratio above 2 2 gcod gss d 3 2 reactor performance 3 2 1 characteristics of aerobic granules the biomass concentration and the percentage of volatile biomass are shown in fig 4 a as expected the biomass growth trend followed the changes in the substrate concentration such that during startup period i the mlss concentration continued to increase until 12000 mg l followed by a sharp increase to about 25000 mg l during period ii at day 65 influent cod 7800 mg l however the granules lost their aggregation potential afterwards and the biomass became fluffy resulting in gradual sludge washout and decline in the mlss concentration to 6000 mg l on day 105 of operation end of period ii during period iii the reactor was operated at an influent cod concentration of 4500 mg l augmented with 10 v v with seed sludge the mlss concentration started to increase reaching 17000 mg l on day 117 nevertheless it gradually declined to around 4000 mg l on day 165 due to severe bulking which resulted in sludge washout from day 168 225 the mlss concentration fluctuated between 4500 and 10 000 mg l a transitioning phase period iv was applied to allow the reactor to recover at a moderate influent cod concentration of 2000 mg l where the biomass concentration increased to above 10000 mg l on day 243 during the final phase of operation period v where an alternate feed loading was applied the mlss concentration stabilized around 9000 mg l from day 248 to the end of the operational period day 316 the average granule size ranged between 0 2 mm and 1 mm throughout the entire period of operation as shown in fig 4 b the size of the granule and the granulation percentage svi30 svi5 followed a similar pattern in terms of stability to that of the biomass concentration where during period i i e the first 30 days the granule size increased to over 0 9 mm along with the granulation percentage of 95 2 7 with the increase in the influent cod concentration afterwards period ii granulation percentage dropped gradually until it reached 55 on day 98 due to the over growth of microorganisms which led to the dominance of flocculent sludge disintegrated granules and flocculent sludge over weighed the presence of large granules and the average granule size started to decline it is worth mentioning however that as shown in the digital camera images fig 5 the large sized granules coexisted with smaller granules that were disintegrating during this phase in period iii from day 106 217 the granules size showed fluctuating trend as observed in the biomass concentration with granulation percentage ranging from 50 90 during the transition phase period iv days 225 247 an average granule size of 1 mm along with a granulation percentage of over 70 was achieved period v the alternate loading phase days 248 316 experienced a severe decline at the beginning followed by an increase in the size of the granules to stabilize around 0 8 mm and granulation percentage of 80 90 3 2 2 morphology and structure of aerobic granules sem images supplementary materials fig s1 showed smooth compact and dense granules were obtained after cultivation examining the granule surface showed that rod shaped bacteria covered the surface of granules no little filaments were found on the granules surfaces throughout the period of operation however granules on days 80 102 showed some broken and disintegrated structure with irregularities ravines and peaks on the surfaces 3 2 3 pollutants removal efficiencies the cod nh3 n and po4 p removal efficiencies during the experiment are shown in fig 6 the cod removal efficiency was more than 95 except when the olr was over 25 kg m3 d from day 46 64 where the removal efficiency dropped to around 60 this can be due to the substrate diffusion limitation of the large sized granules the overgrowth of floccular sludge under such high organic loading conditions out competed the ability of sludge to aggregate which slowly led to the dominance of flocculent sludge in the reactor the ability of the substrate to diffuse into the small sized and disintegrated granules enhanced the cod removal efficiency ammonia nitrogen was below detectable limits 0 1 mg l until day 165 cod n ratio of 100 3 when the cod n ratio increased to 100 4 ammonia nitrogen started to appear in the effluent with fluctuating amounts between 0 1 and 35 mg l neither nitrate nor nitrite was detected these results indicate that the conventional organics to nitrogen ratio bod n cod n in case of biodegradable waste of 100 5 available in the literature needs further investigation when dealing with high strength organics wastewater similarly phosphorus was below detectable limits at cod p ratio up to 100 0 4 at a cod p ratio of 100 0 5 phosphorus started to show in the effluent this indicates that the amount of phosphorus required for growth is very low compared to that agreed upon 100 1 further research is needed for optimizing the amount of nutrients needed for growth in the treatment of high strength organics wastewater where nutrients are supplemented adding a cost burden 3 3 analysis of microbial community 3 3 1 characterization of the main population shifts the microbial community composition of granules was analyzed and compared to that of the seed sludge as shown in fig 7 the family rhodocyclaceae belonging to the betaproteobacteria class showed a relative abundance in the seed sludge 9 1 the results after maturation of granules day 30 showed that rhodocyclaceae increased to 29 7 lv et al 2014 found that the family rhodocyclaceae was enriched at granule core of sliced mature granules suggesting that granule formation is a deterministic process rather than a random aggregation and disintegration mechanism at cod concentration 7500 mg l days 47 102 the trend in rhodocyclaceae showed a sudden decline to 7 3 on day 53 followed by a sharp increase to 58 3 on day 64 decrease to 20 5 on day 71 and further decrease to 9 1 on day 80 in addition the decline in the relative abundance of rhodocyclaceae after 80 days was followed by reactor instability granules breakdown coexistence of large sized granules and flocculent biomass rising sludge with a general decrease in the biomass concentration see fig 4 furthermore it was a precursor for reactor failure on day 102 moreover with the increase in cod concentration the granule size increased as shown in fig 5 with the development of anaerobic core and hollow core in some of the sliced granules archea euryarchate was detected at 0 02 0 09 0 4 0 02 and 0 02 on days 53 64 71 and 90 respectively eukayaota parabasalia was also detected at 0 02 on day 90 these methanogens may have contributed to granule disintegration obligate anaerobic bacteroides spp were previously detected at granule depth of 800 900 μm from the surface of the granule tay et al 2002b the spatial structure of large size granules allowed oxygen consumption by aerobic bacteria predominant in the peripheral and led to a steep oxygen gradient across the biofilm and thus anaerobic bacteria can survive in the core of the granule on the other hand the overabundance of rhodocyclaceae on days 175 and 183 82 and 87 respectively was associated with biomass bulking in the reactor which resulted in washout under the operation of short settling time in general the relative abundance of rhodocyclaceae initially increased up to 50 60 with granule formation or during reactor recovery periods followed by a stabilization around 30 40 after mature and stable granules were dominating the reactor see fig 7 along with rhodocyclaceae the family rhodobacteraceae 26 5 dominated the aerobic granules on day 30 as opposed to less than 0 01 in the seed sludge interestingly rhodobacteraceae abundance was also reported in biofilm formations in various locations in the mediterranean region and the atlantic and pacific oceans the relative abundance of rhodobacteraceae in natural waters appears to be associated with biofilm formations suggesting a selection for certain types of bacteria to settle and form a biofilm elifantz et al 2013 the relative abundance of rhodobacteraceae ranged from 5 to 26 throughout the operational period with the most on day 30 flavobacteriaceae was also identified in all samples with variable relative abundance the seed sludge showed the lowest percentage of 1 4 followed by the granule samples on days 102 and 183 4 1 and 3 8 respectively where major reactor washouts were observed flavobacteriaceae relative abundance was from 9 to 14 for all other samples these results agree with the findings by lv et al 2014 where in their work monitoring granule formation the flocculated biomass was first transited to young granules with increased abundances of flavobacteriaceae xanthomonadaceae rhodobacteraceae and microbacteriaceae then the abundances of anaerobic strains were increased owing to the formation of anaerobic core in addition it was reported that rhodobacteraceae and rhodocyclaceae play an important role in organic matter degradation with rhodobacteraceae being the dominant microbes in the one step anaerobic process having the ability to accumulate phosphorus during denitrification zheng et al 2016 rhodocyclaceae e g thauera sp flavobacteriaceae e g flavobacterium sp are well known denitrifiers and some have been reported to be capable of heterotrophic nitrification garcía 2017 flavobacterium located in the core of the granule was suggested to be an important component of mature granules by supporting granulation through the production of eps performing denitrification and accumulating phosphorus swiatczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 bacteriovoracaceae genus bacteriovorax was identified in granule samples on days 288 302 and 312 at 17 7 15 7 and 15 5 respectively it was not detected in any other samples including the seed sludge bacteriovorax is a gram negative aerobic and obligate predator of gram negative bacteria davidov and jurkevitch 2004 bacterivorous ciliates reduce dispersed bacteria and enhance flocculation in activated sludge madoni 2011 pajdak stós et al 2017 yet predation organisms contribute to granule formation differently as granulation progresses weber et al 2007 indicated that during biofilm development starting from an activated sludge floc up to a mature granule stalked ciliated protozoa settle on activated sludge flocs and build tree like colonies which are colonized by bacteria subsequently these ciliates become completely overgrown by bacteria and die cell remnants of ciliates serve as a backbone for granule formation after maturation compact granules become new substratum for unstalked ciliate swarmers settling on granule surfaces similarly guimarães et al 2017 observed bacterial colonies growing in the eps matrix supported by ciliate stalks it is interesting that the granule sample on day 288 also showed a relative abundance of the family arcobacteraceae arcobacter 14 7 the genera arcobacter is fastidious gram negative organisms which are characterized as the most common human enteric pathogens causing acute bacterial diarrhoea worldwide moreno et al 2003 burkholderiaceae was also identified in granule samples from day 243 288 contributing 12 7 to the total population on day 288 these taxa were recognized as the main degraders of aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene in the constructed wetlands lünsmann et al 2016 and was identified along with rhodobacteraceae in ecological wastewater treatment plants targeting the removal of micropollutants balcom et al 2016 3 3 2 the role of thauera in granule formation and stability the role of thauera was investigated in this study the genus thauera belonging to the family rhodocyclaceae betaproteobacteria class is anaerobic and facultative denitrifying bacteria with the capability to degrade aromatic compounds anaerobically as well as perform denitrification in anoxic environment shinoda et al 2004 the excessive production of eps by thauera was identified as a main cause of viscous bulking and poor sludge dewaterability jiang 2011 garcía 2017 in this experiment after maturation 30 days the genera thauera dominated with 23 4 as opposed to less than 0 1 in the seed the f m ratio during day 30 40 was stable around 1 0 gcod gss d granule disintegration occurred after a sharp decline in thauera to 9 1 on day 90 thauera sp was found to be ps producers for binding together the growing cells wan et al 2013 cydzik kwiatkowska 2015 reported that thauera sp was particularly high 34 69 of otus playing a crucial role in granule formation however the role of ps in granule stability was minimal adav et al 2010 in our experiment under stressed influent cod concentration of 4500 mg l during period iii days 106 217 granulation was restored rapidly in the reactor with an average granule size of 0 9 mm on day 132 however jelly like sludge started to appear in the reactor viscous bulking was associated with thauera dominating the reactor with 82 3 and 87 6 on days 175 and 183 respectively the overabundance of thauera was recognized as a critical point preceding changes in f m ratio f m ratio increased to 2 3 gcod gss d on day 193 after the domination of thauera when the influent cod concentration was decreased to around 2000 mg l period iv from day 225 247 the reactor recovered bulking and stable granules average size 0 8 mm dominated the reactor the relative abundance of thauera dropped to 24 stable reactor was observed in a stable f m ratio of 1 0 1 4 gcod gss d during that period under alternate loading operation day 248 316 the relative abundance of thauera followed an interesting trend increasing from 26 3 on day 273 to 44 9 and 57 1 on days 278 and 281 respectively and dropping to 23 6 on day 288 thauera stabilized at 38 and 37 3 on days 302 and 312 respectively the f m ratio ranged from 1 0 to 1 4 gcod gss d during this stage and stable granules of average size 0 7 0 8 mm dominated the reactor from days 285 until the end of the experiment on day 316 these results indicate that thauera plays a critical role in both granule formation and stability the trend in the relative abundance of thauera is highly associated with eps production in the reactor in a similar way as chemical coagulant performs where an optimum dose is required for successful aggregation flocculation of particles it seems that relative abundance of genera thauera of 25 35 of the total microbial population may characterize the ideal conditions for stable granules 3 3 3 identification of denitrifiers and heterotrophic nitrifiers several key microbial communities with denitrifying as well as heterotrophic nitrification abilities showed relative abundance for example paracoccus was identified as the most abundant genera in family rhodobacteraceae on day 30 representing 25 4 of the total microbial population the genera paracoccus are denifitiers with the ability to use both oxygen and nitrogenous oxides and they can therefore survive in ecosystems with fluctuating aerobic or anaerobic conditions during aerobic conditions the preferred electron acceptor is molecular oxygen and in the absence of free oxygen the electron transfer components required for denitrification must be induced baumann et al 1996 corynebacterium was also identified in granule samples at 7 4 3 2 11 2 19 5 and 35 3 on days 30 53 64 71 and 90 respectively garcía 2017 reported that enhanced nitrogen removal was attained when the actinobacteria corynebacterium sp dominated the reactor as these genera can perform denitrification heterotrophic nitrification and might use nitrate as an electron acceptor for phosphate accumulation acinetobacter belonging to the family moraxellaceae was also identified at 14 9 4 4 3 0 and 7 9 relative abundance on days 53 243 288 and 312 respectively it was shown that acinetobacter is responsible for heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification using ammonia nitrite and nitrate as substrates under low nutrient conditions su et al 2015 moreover it was found that chryseobacterium sp and acinetobacter sp aggregate and then secrete pn to strengthen their aggregation with capability to tolerate cod up to 2964 mg l adav et al 2010 these results indicate that the presence of heterotrophic nitrifying aerobic denitrifying microorganisms such as acinetobacter paracoccus and corynebacterium could potentially be responsible for heterotrophic nitrification in our experiment since neither nitrate nor nitrite was detected in any stages of the experiment such fast growing heterotrophic bacteria could be of great interest as they can provide the advantage of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification under aerobic conditions in addition it can potentially replace the conventional two step nitrification and denitrification under autotrophic aerobic and heterotrophic anaerobic conditions respectively however the dominance of these bacteria was also associated with bulking sludge issues days 55 102 3 3 4 the role of microbial diversity in stability research on natural and engineered ecosystems indicated that maintaining diverse communities may be essential to engineering stable ecosystems using microorganisms beyter et al 2016 community evenness is an indicator of perturbation and stability such that the greater evenness the more functionally stable microbial communities moreover many parallel metabolic and syntrophic pathways are performed by heterogeneous community rather than by a specific population werner et al 2014 therefore understanding the variations can assist us in recognizing critical time points for community stability and resilience which may be potentially modulated in synthetic microbial communities ehsani et al 2018 the seed sludge showed a highly diversified microbial community as shown in table 3 the evenness ratio of seed sludge was 0 75 due to the high diversity after granule cultivation diversity reduced as some strains disappeared due to the feed composition used which was rich in organics and deficient in nutrients such conditions resulted in the dominance of heterotrophs capable of degrading acetate based wastewater while other strains typically found in the complex municipal wastewater vanished reduction of diversity with granulation was also reported in the literature yang et al 2014 bulking issues were also associated with the loss of diversity indicated by low evenness ratios of 0 23 and 0 19 on days 175 and 183 respectively under stressed influent cod concentrations 4500 mg l it is worth mentioning however that a relatively high diversity might not indicate a stable granular system where disintegrated granules on days 53 90 showed evenness of 0 4 0 69 the absence or the overabundance of key microbial populations such as thauera needs to be considered such eps secreting organisms remain crucial for building the granular matrix 3 4 mechanisms and perspectives a strong correlation exists between f m ratio and sludge settleability fig 3 changes in f m ratio under non controlled condition resulted in major population shifts which led to the dominance of certain microbial populations contributing different functions in granule stability thauera sp was observed to play a key role in the early stages of granule formation by acting like a coagulant bridging the bacteria however the overabundance of such eps producing bacteria particularly ps did not contribute to the long term granule structural stability in fact thauera sp showed an increase in the relative abundance during the early formation stages as well as reaggregation during reactor recovery periods followed by a decrease after maturation previous research on ags showed that eps composition can be used as indication to granule maturation and stability with pn ps ratio rather than the content of pn and ps showing a clear correlation to stability lashkarizadeh 2015 yang et al 2014 moreover a strong correlation was reported between secreted pn quantity and auto aggregation indices of individual isolates while no such correlation was noted between ps quantity and auto aggregation the decrease in pn productivity by isolates under high olr indicated that the eps structure of granules was weak thereby leading to granule breakdown adav et al 2010 in this regard the ps and pn contents were examined during the last phase of the experiment days 248 316 when f m ratio was 1 0 1 4 from earlier stages in the experiment this f m range was the most favorable for stable operation and maintenance of microbial diversity the ps content was 24 7 mg g vss for bound eps on day 263 with soluble ps of 13 8 mg l and pn content of 11 2 mg g vss pn ps ratio of 0 4 the relative abundance of thauera sp was 37 7 mean granule size of 320 2 62 7 μm with granulation percentage ranging from 52 to 68 was observed during days 248 265 the tightly bound pn content increased to 231 5 mg l at 31 8 mg g vss with a pn ps ratio of 2 3 on day 268 and a decline of thauera sp to 26 3 as granules dominated the reactor the tightly bound pn content increased to 255 3 mg g vss on day 288 with pn ps of 13 8 thauera sp relative abundance declined to 23 6 stable reactor performance was observed from day 288 to the end of the experiment day 316 characterized by an increase in the pn ps ratio to 14 9 and 20 0 on days 302 and 312 respectively thauera sp relative abundance was 38 3 and 37 1 on days 302 and 312 respectively granulation percentage stabilized around 85 90 with average particle size of 786 6 58 8 μm during days 290 316 it is worth mentioning that a decline in soluble ps was also observed from 13 8 to 1 6 mg l on day 263 to day 312 respectively this result agrees with yang et al 2014 who reported that pn ps ratio increased from 5 to 10 as granulation increased the three dimensional excitation and emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectra of tb eps on day 288 supplementary material fig s 2 showed peeks with very strong intensities at regions iv associated with soluble microbial products tryptophan pn like materials and other aromatic pn and v humic acid like material according to eem boundaries defined in chen et al 2003 unlike what was reported in adav et al 2010 regarding the limited ability of acinetobacter sp to tolerate cod 3000 mg l acinetobacter sp was also identified at 14 9 4 4 3 and 7 9 relative abundance on days 53 243 288 and 312 respectively at influent cod concentrations up to 7500 mg l these bacteria could have potentially contributed to granule aggregation however stable granules were observed in samples with very low relative abundance of acinetobacter sp day 30 0 4 moreover the highest relative abundance of acinetobacter sp appearing on day 53 14 9 was not sufficient to yield stable granules as the presence of methanogens in the granule core may have higher impact on granule disintegration based on our experiments f m ratio was identified as a decisive parameter in granule settleability and microbial dynamics in the reactor we argue that a combination of various microbial communities with microbial diversity and relative abundance of key microbial populations responsible for eps production i e thauera are crucial to granule formation and stability 4 conclusions aerobic granules were successfully developed in sbr under different influent cod concentrations 2000 7500 mg l the cod concentration at cultivation affected the period required for granule formation where higher olr promoted faster granule formation however after maturation sludge loading rate f m ratio appeared to play a decisive role in granule stability stable granules with outstanding settleability svi 50 ml g were maintained in the reactor at f m ratio between 0 5 and 1 4 gcod gss d an increase in the f m ratio above 2 2 gcod gss d led to fluffy granules bulking issues and washouts f m triggered the microbial selection community and diversity at high f m ratios denitrifiers and heterotrophic nitrifiers dominated the reactor it is apparent that eps secreting organisms thauera sp play a major role in both granule formation and long term granule structural integrity and stability with an optimum range of 25 35 relative abundance statistical analysis showed a significant main effect for f m ratio on granule settleability represented in svi at α 0 001 an exponential equation was developed between f m ratio and svi with r squared and the standard error of the regression s of 0 5 and 0 4 respectively the regression analysis showed the significance of the model and the coefficients at α 0 001 findings of this study provide important information on the operational boundaries of f m ratio and its impact on granule settleability microbial community composition the functional groups of microorganisms the proportions

19251,this work investigated the long term stability of aerobic granular sludge treating high strength organic wastewater in a semi pilot scale sequential batch reactor sbr the reactor was operated for 316 days under different operational conditions it was found that the f m ratio is an important parameter affecting granules formation and stability three selection mechanisms were investigated 1 cultivation and maturation at moderately high influent cod concentration 2500 mg l followed by increase in influent cod concentration to 7500 mg l 2 stressed cultivation and operation at high influent cod concentration of 4500 mg l and 3 alternate feed loading strategy variable influent cod concentration across the daily schedule of cycles at 50 75 and 100 of the peak concentration of 5000 mg l it was found that adopting high olr at the reactor start up accelerated the formation of granules however the overgrowth of biomass under high organics concentration negatively affected the stability of granules and led to disintegration due to the presence of methanogens in the granule core cultivation at high organics concentration resulted in a rapid loss of microbial diversity and reactor failure under alternate feed loading adequate selection of microbial community was maintained and resulted in stable reactor performance moreover a strong correlation between f m ratio and the granules settling ability was observed when f m ratio exceeded 1 5 gcod gss d granules showed poor settleability and under very high sludge loading rates above 2 5 sludge bulking occurred and led to washout of sludge due to the strong selection pressure of short settling time operating the reactor at f m ratio of 0 5 1 4 gcod gss d appears to favor stable long term granule stability graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge food to microorganism ratio high strength organic wastewater microbial diversity wastewater treatment 1 introduction recent developments have favored aerobic granular sludge ags over conventional activated sludge processes cas due to the reactor compact design outstanding settleability the ability of aerobic granules to withstand high organic loading rates olrs and the potential for simultaneous organics and nutrients removal adav et al 2008 while many full scale ags applications have been implemented for the treatment of municipal wastewater it remains less competitive for industrial full scale applications especially for high strength organic wastewaters when compared to high rate anaerobic reactors such as the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb mainly due to the operational costs required for ags and the mass transfer limitations at olrs 5 7 kg m3 d gao et al 2011 however during the last 25 years aerobic granulation has evolved and has proven to be one of the most efficient and well suited biological wastewater treatment technologies for high strength organic wastewater ags overcomes the drawbacks of anaerobic treatment processes such as low growth rates of microorganisms the high sensitivity to toxic loadings low temperatures ph changes fluctuations in environmental conditions the low settling rate of biomass and the need for post treatment of the noxious anaerobic effluent which often contains ammonium ion nh4 and hydrogen sulfide hs chan et al 2009 grady et al 2011 rajeshwari et al 2000 leitão et al 2006 moreover the effluent quality in ags can meet the discharge limits ahammad et al 2013 lópez palau et al 2012 the rapid formation of aerobic granules compared to months in anaerobic granules the good settling ability high biomass retention tolerance to toxicity and resistance to shock loading and the smaller footprint when compared to cas sets ags as a very promising technology for industrial applications for treatment high strength organic wastewater tay et al 2002a lv et al 2014 show et al 2012 ivanov et al 2006 abdullah et al 2013 moy et al 2002 show et al 2012 2012 liu et al 2015 kocaturk and erguder 2016 adav et al 2010 long et al 2015 however granule disintegration remains an unresolved problem of the ags technology sarma et al 2017 several theories have been put forward for the formation of ags including the essential role of hydrodynamic shear force liu and tay 2002 short settling time adav et al 2009 liu and tay 2004 and intermittent feast famine conditions or periodic starvation and its effect on cell hydrophobicity lópez palau et al 2012 beun et al 2002 tay et al 2001 selection for slow growing organisms such as phosphate or glycogen accumulating bacteria was proposed for maintaining granule stability de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 reasons behind granule instability and disintegration were also studied and attributed to many factors such as proliferation of filamentous bacteria at high substrate loading rates moy et al 2002 liu and liu 2006 liu et al 2007 liu and tay 2012 anaerobic fermentation of dead and lysed cells in large sized granules tay et al 2002a 2002b ivanov et al 2005 lv et al 2014 and destruction in the structure of extracellular polymeric substances eps with proteins pn playing an essential role in granule stability long et al 2015 unlike cas the absence of decisive operating parameters for a stable and reliable operation of ags reactor remains the key challenge impeding the full scale industrial application of ags the majority of research on ags was conducted for a short operational period in addition although various theories have been proposed for reactor instability little emphasis was given to process optimization and the link between the engineering aspects and the underlying fundamental microbiology current knowledge of the different operating strategies focused on olr as a critical operating parameter where aerobic granulation has been reported to withstand olr up to 15 kg chemical oxygen demand cod m3 d in sbrs moy et al 2002 show et al 2012 kocaturk and erguder 2016 and disintegration was reported at olr of 21 3 kg scod m3 at critical cod values for granule disintegration of 3000 4000 mg l due to the decrease in protein productivity by isolates under high olr adav et al 2010 long et al 2015 attributed the loss of stability of aerobic granules at olr of 18 kg m3 d to the increase of the granule size which resulted in the formation of massive dead cells inside the core of the granules causing disintegration of the granular structures anaerobic feeding was adopted to control the size of the granules by favoring the relatively low growth rate of the paos phosphate accumulating organisms or gaos glycogen accumulating organisms bacteria through the conversion of easily biodegradable substrate to storage polymers to be used during the aerobic phase and thus maintain a relatively low growth rate favoring the granule stability pronk et al 2015 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 in the absence of anaerobic feeding alternating feast and famine conditions was believed to play a key role in granule stability during the feast period the organic matter is oxidized and stored inside bacterial cells as poly hydroxyalkanoates phas while during the famine period the bacteria grow on the stored compounds periodic starvation with famine period lasting twice longer than feast period was found to have a strong effect on cell hydrophobicity lópez palau et al 2012 and can enhance granule stability liu et al 2016a recent studies highlighted the impact of f m ratio on granule stability and established a ratio of 0 4 0 5 gcod gss d for achieving stable granules with good settleability high pollutant removal efficiency and microbial diversity wu et al 2018 food to microorganisms f m ratio is a key practical parameter that has been studied in cas processes jenkins et al 2003 f m ratio is defined as the load of substrate applied per day per unit biomass in the reactor f m is usually in the range of 0 25 0 5 kg bod kg mlvss d for cas and uasb and 0 07 0 15 kg bod kg mlvss d in extended aeration metcalf and eddy 2014 sperling 2007 at high f m ratios the floc forming bacteria dominate over filamentous bacteria due to their ability to assimilate high load of substrate compared to the filamentous bacteria sperling 2007 however high f m ratio can result in surplus substrate in the effluent as the biodegradable organic matter exceeds the consumption capacity of the biomass in the system high solids retention times srts are associated with low f m values and vice versa where an optimum srt for good bioflocculation and low effluent cod was found to be in the range of 2 8 days rittmann 1987 the procedure to control f m ratio in cas is by adjusting the solids concentration through manipulating either the return activated sludge ras or waste sludge or both in accordance with the influent substrate load most current ags applications are in a sequential batch reactor sbr mode where the clarifier is eliminated and a settling phase is included in the reactor operation schedule thus a ras line is not applicable and the reactor operation relies on the amount of biomass retained in the reactor after decanting such selection mechanism determines the biomass concentration as well as microbial species in the reactor and thus controls the f m ratio theoretically an infinite srt sludge age can be attained however the washout dynamics of the biomass at the decant level plays a decisive role on both the microbial population retained in the reactor as well as the srt as demonstrated by liu et al 2016b where the selection pressure created by hrt and srt on aerobic granulation was negligible when compared to the selection pressure from short settling time moreover it was highlighted that the microbial population shift was observed mainly during reactor startup first 6 days due to the washed out sludge which led to difference of microbial community in the reactor and effluent while as the experiment progressed no apparent difference was observed between the microorganisms retained in the reactor and those in the effluent liu et al 2016b in addition in studying the effect of f m ratio on ags in sbr it is challenging to avoid the interference with the hydraulic selection pressure mainly the settling velocity determined by the settling time li et al 2008a b found that in contrast to cas ags in sbr is unlikely dependent on srt and that granulation was not attained at all the studied srts 3 40 days in the absence of a strong hydraulic selection pressure however the long term system performance was not investigated furthermore in most studies on ags the reactors were operated at f m ratios comparable to that of cas 0 13 to 0 29 gcod gss d janga et al 2007 0 33 gcod gss d tay et al 2004 0 2 to 0 4 gcod gss d kang and yuan 2017 li et al 2008a b found that after maturation granules cultivated under different f m ratios 0 3 1 0 4 2 and 6 0 gcod gss d all stabilized at sludge loading rates of 0 5 g cod g ss d li et al 2011 adopted a higher f m ratio of 1 1 gcod gss d in the early stage to stimulate rapid formation and reduced the f m ratio to 0 3 gcod gss d in the later stage to sustain small and healthy granules wu et al 2018 revealed that stable granules with good settleability high pollutant removal efficiency and microbial diversity were achieved when f m ratio was controlled through quantitative sludge discharge at 0 4 0 5 gcod gss d 0 4 0 02 gcod gss d however the stability boundaries of f m ratio in ags are still not clear the long term impact of f m on the dynamics of the microbial population in an ags reactor and process performance is yet to be investigated studies on the microbial community composition and dynamics in ags under different operational conditions and wastewater compositions do not give clear conclusions on the role of the different microbial groups on granule stability and process performance wilén et al 2018 therefore this work aimed at determining the impact of f m ratio on the long term stability of aerobic granules under different operational conditions in order to establish clear stability boundaries of f m ratio in ags reactor treating high strength organics wastewater in addition information currently available in the literature with respect to the favorable operational conditions the dynamics of the microbial population in an ags reactor and process performance are not sufficient for predictable startup and operation of ags reactor for treatment of high strength organics wastewater the study looked at the long term impact of f m on the dynamics of the microbial population and the role of the different microbial groups on granule stability and process performance four main objectives were studied in this work 1 determination of the impact and the statistical significance of f m ratio on the settleability of ags 2 investigation of the effect and the statistical significance of f m ratio on the wash out dynamics microbial selection and population shifts and the relative abundance and function of the microbial community in the reactor 3 determination of the threshold of f m ratio for long term stable operation of ags for the treatment of high strength organics wastewater 4 evaluation of the reactor performance in terms of effluent quality parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up seed sludge and media one cylindrical acrylic reactor with an internal diameter of 150 mm and a working volume of 18 l was used as the sbr for the experiment aeration was provided via fine air bubble diffusers located at the bottom of the reactor with an air flow rate of 28 l min which resulted in a superficial upflow air velocity of 2 8 cm s influent was introduced at the bottom of the reactor while effluent was discharged through an outlet port placed at intermediate height of the reactor the reactor cycle was operated sequentially influent filling 8 min aeration 180 222 min settling 8 20 min and effluent withdrawal 2 min the influent fill and effluent withdrawal times were kept constant throughout the experimental period the settling time was decreased from 20 min to 8 min in the cultivation stage first week of operation with the remaining being aeration stage where changes in the cycle time during periods ii and iii was due to extending the aeration period ras from pine creek wastewater treatment plant in calgary was used as inoculum to start up the system and re inoculation for augmenting the biomass with the diversified community the seed sludge collected throughout the operation period was tested for seasonal variations it was greyish brown in color and had an average suspended solids ss concentration of 7 2 0 8 g l 80 volatile sludge volume index svi of 136 18 ml g and a mean particle size of 118 6 4 5 μm the synthetic wastewater consisted of sodium acetate anhydrous as sole carbon source nitrogen nh4cl and phosphorus k2hpo4 kh2po4 were supplemented and other necessary elements were similar to that detailed elsewhere tay et al 2002b the experiment was conducted at room temperature 18 2 c the experimental campaign followed five main operational periods as follows detailed operational parameters of the reactor are shown in table 1 period i days 1 30 reactor startup granules cultivation and maturation were achieved period ii days 34 105 influent cod concentration was increased up to 7500 mg l with adjustments in hrt and cod n ratios based on residual cod and nh3 n concentrations period iii days 106 217 applied cod concentration and olr was reduced and cod n p ratio was adjusted based on results from period ii period iv days 225 247 influent cod concentration was further reduced to medium strength organics wastewater conditions 2000 mg l for preparation for period v period v days 248 316 reactor was operated under alternate loading conditions at different cod n p ratios where variable influent cod concentration followed a daily schedule of 2 cycles at 5000 mg l 2 cycles at 3750 mg l and 2 cycles at 2500 mg l adjustments to influent nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were implemented throughout the experimental campaign to ensure that nutrients were supplemented to meet the minimal growth requirements hrt was elongated during period ii from 6 h to 6 7 h and iii further to 8 h to ensure complete degradation of cod concentration and the achievement of periodic starvation hamza et al 2018 f m was controlled by regulating olr mlss concentration was dependent on the applied olr and the biomass retained in the reactor i e no sludge discharge was implemented sludge settling properties was chosen as the control parameter where the duration of each experimental phase was determined based on biomass settling properties as expressed in both svi30 and granulation percent expressed as svi30 svi5 during period i cultivation and maturation the goal was to achieve svi30 50 ml g and granulation percent svi30 svi5 90 to ensure excellent granule properties for the experiment during the next phases of the experiment each experiment phase was ended when svi30 increased above 100 ml g or svi30 svi5 dropped below 80 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 biomass characteristics biomass characteristics mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and svi30 were analyzed in accordance with the standard methods apha awwa wef 2012 for svi5 measurement 5 min settling time was used instead of the 30 min as described in liu et al 2010 mean particle size and size distribution were measured by a laser particle size analysis system with a measuring range from 0 to 2000 μm malvern mastersizer series 2000 malvern instruments ltd 2 2 2 wastewater characteristics influent and effluent samples filtered through 0 45 μm membranes were analyzed for soluble cod scod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and phosphate po4 3 scod was determined by hach dr 2400 hach company with hach kits following the usepa reactor digestion method cod hr and hr plus nh4 n was analyzed using the salicylate method tnt plus 830 ulr 831 lr 832 hr and 833 uhr po4 3 was analyzed using metrohm compact ic flex 2 2 3 granule structure and morphology observation granules were taken out of the reactors during the settling phase the granules were fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde in 0 1m phosphate buffer solution ph 7 0 and kept overnight at 4 c afterwards the granules were washed with phosphate buffered solution pbs three times and immobilized with 1 osmium tetroxide oso4 in distilled water for 45 min then oso4 was discarded and the granules were washed three times with pbs next the granules were dehydrated by immersing them in ethanol solution of consecutively higher concentrations 10 25 40 55 70 80 90 and 100 for 45 min each and the last step of 100 concentration was repeated three times samples were then dried in a critical point dryer with liquid co2 seevac inc florida coated with gold and analyzed with the scanning electron microscope sem fei philips xl 30 other pictures of granules were taken with digital camera iphone 6s apple inc 2 2 4 microbial community analysis genomic dna was extracted using a dneasy powersoil kit from qiagen inc md usa paired end sequencing based on the 16s rrna gene and subsequent taxonomic analysis are conducted as detailed in hamza et al 2018 2 2 5 eps extraction and analysis chemical extraction method using formamide was adopted for eps extraction following the protocol described by liang et al 2010 10 ml of the reactor mixed liquor was withdrawn from the system and used for the extraction of soluble eps seps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps the extracted seps lb eps and tb eps were analyzed for polysaccharides ps and protein pn ps content was determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 with glucose as the standard pn content was determined using peterson s modification of the lowry method peterson 1977 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of f m ratio on the settleability of aerobic granules the profiles of f m ratio based on scod and svi are shown in fig 1 a strong correlation was found between f m ratio and sludge settleability represented in svi during startup at influent cod concentration 2 42 0 19 g l and until day 10 of operation the svi showed a fluctuating trend afterwards stable and mature granules dominated the reactor improving the sludge settleability after 30 days period i the svi dropped to below 50 ml gss the biomass continued to show good settling sustaining an svi below 40 ml g until day 90 subsequently the reactor experienced a sharp increase in f m ratio to above 2 3 gcod gss d due to granules disintegration coupled with washout of fluffly flocs under short settling time of 8 min end of period ii on day 106 the cod concentration was decreased to around 4500 mg l period iii and the reactor biomass was augmented with seed sludge 20 v v to restore diversity despite the improvement in sludge settleability along with the decrease in the f m ratio the granular sludge stability was not maintained on day 165 severe bulking was observed the wastewater composition was modified to maintain a cod n ratio of 100 4 to ensure the presence of sufficient nitrogen and seed sludge 20 v v was added however the sludge settleability showed fluctuations followed by washout of biomass mlss dropped to around 4300 mg l on day 217 end of period iii in period iv from day 225 247 the influent cod concentration was reduced to 2 12 0 31 g l to adjust the f m ratio and hence improve sludge settling in period v from day 248 316 the reactor was operated under an alternating feed loading conditions where the influent cod concentration daily schedule was 2 cycles at 5000 mg l 2 cycles at 3750 mg l and 2 cycles at 2500 mg l with an average olr of 11 1 1 5 kg m3 d the reactor showed stable operation at f m ratio between 1 0 and 1 4 gcod gss d and svi below 60 ml g for the 68 days of operation under these conditions a strong statistical correlation was shown between f m ratio and the sludge settleability where at a two tail test α 0 001 the correlation is statistically significant with pearson s correlation coefficient of 0 585 and 0 526 for svi5 and svi30 respectively according to the statistical analysis conducted using spss ibm corp shown in table 2 there was a significant main effect for f m ratio on the settleability of granules svi30 after controlling for the effect of cod n and cod p f 50 32 30 021 p 5 1e 17 curve estimation and regression model showed that an exponential relationship exists between f m ratio and biomass settleability represented in svi the model equation can be written as s v i 23 259 e 0 5221 f m where svi is in ml g and f m is in gcod gss d the goodness of the fit assessed by r squared and the standard error of the regression s was 0 5 and 0 4 respectively the regression analysis showed the significance of the model and the coefficients at α 0 001 it is worth mentioning however that capability of the model for prediction is diminished as f m ratio increases above 2 as shown in fig 2 this can be attributed to the fact that at higher f m ratios the biomass is characterized by the co existence of flocculent as well as granular biomass due to the rapid biomass growth such growth over competed the ability of biomass to aggregate hamza et al 2018 adav et al 2010 indicated that at a cod medium 3000 mg l most functional strains lost capability for auto aggregation and pn or ps productivity therefore the abundance of floccular biomass over granular biomass at high f m shifts the settleability of the biomass towards that of suspended cultures from these results it can be concluded that f m ratio gcod gss d plays an important role in the stability of ags treating high strength organic wastewater to provide a flexible range of operation four groups of f m ratio based on the corresponding actual svi values were identified as shown in fig 3 at f m ratios between 0 5 and 1 0 gcod gss d the mean svi value was 34 8 8 3 ml g from 1 1 to 1 4 gcod gss d the svi increased to 46 9 17 3 ml g from 1 5 to 2 2 gcod gss d the svi further increased to 74 2 23 1 ml g at f m 2 2 gcod gss d svi showed mean value of 119 8 52 8 ml g and the sludge settleability was affected negatively and it was difficult to retain the biomass in the reactor it is worth mentioning that high variability in the svi values as indicated by the standard deviation within each group was observed with the increasing f m ratios at f m ratios between 1 5 and 2 2 the variability was over 30 and such deviation increased to over 40 at f m ratios above 2 2 gcod gss d such variation reflects the instability in granule settleability when subjected to this range of high sludge loading rates moreover the aggregation ability of biomass to form granules becomes diminished reactor failure follows the increase of f m ratio above 2 2 gcod gss d 3 2 reactor performance 3 2 1 characteristics of aerobic granules the biomass concentration and the percentage of volatile biomass are shown in fig 4 a as expected the biomass growth trend followed the changes in the substrate concentration such that during startup period i the mlss concentration continued to increase until 12000 mg l followed by a sharp increase to about 25000 mg l during period ii at day 65 influent cod 7800 mg l however the granules lost their aggregation potential afterwards and the biomass became fluffy resulting in gradual sludge washout and decline in the mlss concentration to 6000 mg l on day 105 of operation end of period ii during period iii the reactor was operated at an influent cod concentration of 4500 mg l augmented with 10 v v with seed sludge the mlss concentration started to increase reaching 17000 mg l on day 117 nevertheless it gradually declined to around 4000 mg l on day 165 due to severe bulking which resulted in sludge washout from day 168 225 the mlss concentration fluctuated between 4500 and 10 000 mg l a transitioning phase period iv was applied to allow the reactor to recover at a moderate influent cod concentration of 2000 mg l where the biomass concentration increased to above 10000 mg l on day 243 during the final phase of operation period v where an alternate feed loading was applied the mlss concentration stabilized around 9000 mg l from day 248 to the end of the operational period day 316 the average granule size ranged between 0 2 mm and 1 mm throughout the entire period of operation as shown in fig 4 b the size of the granule and the granulation percentage svi30 svi5 followed a similar pattern in terms of stability to that of the biomass concentration where during period i i e the first 30 days the granule size increased to over 0 9 mm along with the granulation percentage of 95 2 7 with the increase in the influent cod concentration afterwards period ii granulation percentage dropped gradually until it reached 55 on day 98 due to the over growth of microorganisms which led to the dominance of flocculent sludge disintegrated granules and flocculent sludge over weighed the presence of large granules and the average granule size started to decline it is worth mentioning however that as shown in the digital camera images fig 5 the large sized granules coexisted with smaller granules that were disintegrating during this phase in period iii from day 106 217 the granules size showed fluctuating trend as observed in the biomass concentration with granulation percentage ranging from 50 90 during the transition phase period iv days 225 247 an average granule size of 1 mm along with a granulation percentage of over 70 was achieved period v the alternate loading phase days 248 316 experienced a severe decline at the beginning followed by an increase in the size of the granules to stabilize around 0 8 mm and granulation percentage of 80 90 3 2 2 morphology and structure of aerobic granules sem images supplementary materials fig s1 showed smooth compact and dense granules were obtained after cultivation examining the granule surface showed that rod shaped bacteria covered the surface of granules no little filaments were found on the granules surfaces throughout the period of operation however granules on days 80 102 showed some broken and disintegrated structure with irregularities ravines and peaks on the surfaces 3 2 3 pollutants removal efficiencies the cod nh3 n and po4 p removal efficiencies during the experiment are shown in fig 6 the cod removal efficiency was more than 95 except when the olr was over 25 kg m3 d from day 46 64 where the removal efficiency dropped to around 60 this can be due to the substrate diffusion limitation of the large sized granules the overgrowth of floccular sludge under such high organic loading conditions out competed the ability of sludge to aggregate which slowly led to the dominance of flocculent sludge in the reactor the ability of the substrate to diffuse into the small sized and disintegrated granules enhanced the cod removal efficiency ammonia nitrogen was below detectable limits 0 1 mg l until day 165 cod n ratio of 100 3 when the cod n ratio increased to 100 4 ammonia nitrogen started to appear in the effluent with fluctuating amounts between 0 1 and 35 mg l neither nitrate nor nitrite was detected these results indicate that the conventional organics to nitrogen ratio bod n cod n in case of biodegradable waste of 100 5 available in the literature needs further investigation when dealing with high strength organics wastewater similarly phosphorus was below detectable limits at cod p ratio up to 100 0 4 at a cod p ratio of 100 0 5 phosphorus started to show in the effluent this indicates that the amount of phosphorus required for growth is very low compared to that agreed upon 100 1 further research is needed for optimizing the amount of nutrients needed for growth in the treatment of high strength organics wastewater where nutrients are supplemented adding a cost burden 3 3 analysis of microbial community 3 3 1 characterization of the main population shifts the microbial community composition of granules was analyzed and compared to that of the seed sludge as shown in fig 7 the family rhodocyclaceae belonging to the betaproteobacteria class showed a relative abundance in the seed sludge 9 1 the results after maturation of granules day 30 showed that rhodocyclaceae increased to 29 7 lv et al 2014 found that the family rhodocyclaceae was enriched at granule core of sliced mature granules suggesting that granule formation is a deterministic process rather than a random aggregation and disintegration mechanism at cod concentration 7500 mg l days 47 102 the trend in rhodocyclaceae showed a sudden decline to 7 3 on day 53 followed by a sharp increase to 58 3 on day 64 decrease to 20 5 on day 71 and further decrease to 9 1 on day 80 in addition the decline in the relative abundance of rhodocyclaceae after 80 days was followed by reactor instability granules breakdown coexistence of large sized granules and flocculent biomass rising sludge with a general decrease in the biomass concentration see fig 4 furthermore it was a precursor for reactor failure on day 102 moreover with the increase in cod concentration the granule size increased as shown in fig 5 with the development of anaerobic core and hollow core in some of the sliced granules archea euryarchate was detected at 0 02 0 09 0 4 0 02 and 0 02 on days 53 64 71 and 90 respectively eukayaota parabasalia was also detected at 0 02 on day 90 these methanogens may have contributed to granule disintegration obligate anaerobic bacteroides spp were previously detected at granule depth of 800 900 μm from the surface of the granule tay et al 2002b the spatial structure of large size granules allowed oxygen consumption by aerobic bacteria predominant in the peripheral and led to a steep oxygen gradient across the biofilm and thus anaerobic bacteria can survive in the core of the granule on the other hand the overabundance of rhodocyclaceae on days 175 and 183 82 and 87 respectively was associated with biomass bulking in the reactor which resulted in washout under the operation of short settling time in general the relative abundance of rhodocyclaceae initially increased up to 50 60 with granule formation or during reactor recovery periods followed by a stabilization around 30 40 after mature and stable granules were dominating the reactor see fig 7 along with rhodocyclaceae the family rhodobacteraceae 26 5 dominated the aerobic granules on day 30 as opposed to less than 0 01 in the seed sludge interestingly rhodobacteraceae abundance was also reported in biofilm formations in various locations in the mediterranean region and the atlantic and pacific oceans the relative abundance of rhodobacteraceae in natural waters appears to be associated with biofilm formations suggesting a selection for certain types of bacteria to settle and form a biofilm elifantz et al 2013 the relative abundance of rhodobacteraceae ranged from 5 to 26 throughout the operational period with the most on day 30 flavobacteriaceae was also identified in all samples with variable relative abundance the seed sludge showed the lowest percentage of 1 4 followed by the granule samples on days 102 and 183 4 1 and 3 8 respectively where major reactor washouts were observed flavobacteriaceae relative abundance was from 9 to 14 for all other samples these results agree with the findings by lv et al 2014 where in their work monitoring granule formation the flocculated biomass was first transited to young granules with increased abundances of flavobacteriaceae xanthomonadaceae rhodobacteraceae and microbacteriaceae then the abundances of anaerobic strains were increased owing to the formation of anaerobic core in addition it was reported that rhodobacteraceae and rhodocyclaceae play an important role in organic matter degradation with rhodobacteraceae being the dominant microbes in the one step anaerobic process having the ability to accumulate phosphorus during denitrification zheng et al 2016 rhodocyclaceae e g thauera sp flavobacteriaceae e g flavobacterium sp are well known denitrifiers and some have been reported to be capable of heterotrophic nitrification garcía 2017 flavobacterium located in the core of the granule was suggested to be an important component of mature granules by supporting granulation through the production of eps performing denitrification and accumulating phosphorus swiatczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 bacteriovoracaceae genus bacteriovorax was identified in granule samples on days 288 302 and 312 at 17 7 15 7 and 15 5 respectively it was not detected in any other samples including the seed sludge bacteriovorax is a gram negative aerobic and obligate predator of gram negative bacteria davidov and jurkevitch 2004 bacterivorous ciliates reduce dispersed bacteria and enhance flocculation in activated sludge madoni 2011 pajdak stós et al 2017 yet predation organisms contribute to granule formation differently as granulation progresses weber et al 2007 indicated that during biofilm development starting from an activated sludge floc up to a mature granule stalked ciliated protozoa settle on activated sludge flocs and build tree like colonies which are colonized by bacteria subsequently these ciliates become completely overgrown by bacteria and die cell remnants of ciliates serve as a backbone for granule formation after maturation compact granules become new substratum for unstalked ciliate swarmers settling on granule surfaces similarly guimarães et al 2017 observed bacterial colonies growing in the eps matrix supported by ciliate stalks it is interesting that the granule sample on day 288 also showed a relative abundance of the family arcobacteraceae arcobacter 14 7 the genera arcobacter is fastidious gram negative organisms which are characterized as the most common human enteric pathogens causing acute bacterial diarrhoea worldwide moreno et al 2003 burkholderiaceae was also identified in granule samples from day 243 288 contributing 12 7 to the total population on day 288 these taxa were recognized as the main degraders of aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene in the constructed wetlands lünsmann et al 2016 and was identified along with rhodobacteraceae in ecological wastewater treatment plants targeting the removal of micropollutants balcom et al 2016 3 3 2 the role of thauera in granule formation and stability the role of thauera was investigated in this study the genus thauera belonging to the family rhodocyclaceae betaproteobacteria class is anaerobic and facultative denitrifying bacteria with the capability to degrade aromatic compounds anaerobically as well as perform denitrification in anoxic environment shinoda et al 2004 the excessive production of eps by thauera was identified as a main cause of viscous bulking and poor sludge dewaterability jiang 2011 garcía 2017 in this experiment after maturation 30 days the genera thauera dominated with 23 4 as opposed to less than 0 1 in the seed the f m ratio during day 30 40 was stable around 1 0 gcod gss d granule disintegration occurred after a sharp decline in thauera to 9 1 on day 90 thauera sp was found to be ps producers for binding together the growing cells wan et al 2013 cydzik kwiatkowska 2015 reported that thauera sp was particularly high 34 69 of otus playing a crucial role in granule formation however the role of ps in granule stability was minimal adav et al 2010 in our experiment under stressed influent cod concentration of 4500 mg l during period iii days 106 217 granulation was restored rapidly in the reactor with an average granule size of 0 9 mm on day 132 however jelly like sludge started to appear in the reactor viscous bulking was associated with thauera dominating the reactor with 82 3 and 87 6 on days 175 and 183 respectively the overabundance of thauera was recognized as a critical point preceding changes in f m ratio f m ratio increased to 2 3 gcod gss d on day 193 after the domination of thauera when the influent cod concentration was decreased to around 2000 mg l period iv from day 225 247 the reactor recovered bulking and stable granules average size 0 8 mm dominated the reactor the relative abundance of thauera dropped to 24 stable reactor was observed in a stable f m ratio of 1 0 1 4 gcod gss d during that period under alternate loading operation day 248 316 the relative abundance of thauera followed an interesting trend increasing from 26 3 on day 273 to 44 9 and 57 1 on days 278 and 281 respectively and dropping to 23 6 on day 288 thauera stabilized at 38 and 37 3 on days 302 and 312 respectively the f m ratio ranged from 1 0 to 1 4 gcod gss d during this stage and stable granules of average size 0 7 0 8 mm dominated the reactor from days 285 until the end of the experiment on day 316 these results indicate that thauera plays a critical role in both granule formation and stability the trend in the relative abundance of thauera is highly associated with eps production in the reactor in a similar way as chemical coagulant performs where an optimum dose is required for successful aggregation flocculation of particles it seems that relative abundance of genera thauera of 25 35 of the total microbial population may characterize the ideal conditions for stable granules 3 3 3 identification of denitrifiers and heterotrophic nitrifiers several key microbial communities with denitrifying as well as heterotrophic nitrification abilities showed relative abundance for example paracoccus was identified as the most abundant genera in family rhodobacteraceae on day 30 representing 25 4 of the total microbial population the genera paracoccus are denifitiers with the ability to use both oxygen and nitrogenous oxides and they can therefore survive in ecosystems with fluctuating aerobic or anaerobic conditions during aerobic conditions the preferred electron acceptor is molecular oxygen and in the absence of free oxygen the electron transfer components required for denitrification must be induced baumann et al 1996 corynebacterium was also identified in granule samples at 7 4 3 2 11 2 19 5 and 35 3 on days 30 53 64 71 and 90 respectively garcía 2017 reported that enhanced nitrogen removal was attained when the actinobacteria corynebacterium sp dominated the reactor as these genera can perform denitrification heterotrophic nitrification and might use nitrate as an electron acceptor for phosphate accumulation acinetobacter belonging to the family moraxellaceae was also identified at 14 9 4 4 3 0 and 7 9 relative abundance on days 53 243 288 and 312 respectively it was shown that acinetobacter is responsible for heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification using ammonia nitrite and nitrate as substrates under low nutrient conditions su et al 2015 moreover it was found that chryseobacterium sp and acinetobacter sp aggregate and then secrete pn to strengthen their aggregation with capability to tolerate cod up to 2964 mg l adav et al 2010 these results indicate that the presence of heterotrophic nitrifying aerobic denitrifying microorganisms such as acinetobacter paracoccus and corynebacterium could potentially be responsible for heterotrophic nitrification in our experiment since neither nitrate nor nitrite was detected in any stages of the experiment such fast growing heterotrophic bacteria could be of great interest as they can provide the advantage of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification under aerobic conditions in addition it can potentially replace the conventional two step nitrification and denitrification under autotrophic aerobic and heterotrophic anaerobic conditions respectively however the dominance of these bacteria was also associated with bulking sludge issues days 55 102 3 3 4 the role of microbial diversity in stability research on natural and engineered ecosystems indicated that maintaining diverse communities may be essential to engineering stable ecosystems using microorganisms beyter et al 2016 community evenness is an indicator of perturbation and stability such that the greater evenness the more functionally stable microbial communities moreover many parallel metabolic and syntrophic pathways are performed by heterogeneous community rather than by a specific population werner et al 2014 therefore understanding the variations can assist us in recognizing critical time points for community stability and resilience which may be potentially modulated in synthetic microbial communities ehsani et al 2018 the seed sludge showed a highly diversified microbial community as shown in table 3 the evenness ratio of seed sludge was 0 75 due to the high diversity after granule cultivation diversity reduced as some strains disappeared due to the feed composition used which was rich in organics and deficient in nutrients such conditions resulted in the dominance of heterotrophs capable of degrading acetate based wastewater while other strains typically found in the complex municipal wastewater vanished reduction of diversity with granulation was also reported in the literature yang et al 2014 bulking issues were also associated with the loss of diversity indicated by low evenness ratios of 0 23 and 0 19 on days 175 and 183 respectively under stressed influent cod concentrations 4500 mg l it is worth mentioning however that a relatively high diversity might not indicate a stable granular system where disintegrated granules on days 53 90 showed evenness of 0 4 0 69 the absence or the overabundance of key microbial populations such as thauera needs to be considered such eps secreting organisms remain crucial for building the granular matrix 3 4 mechanisms and perspectives a strong correlation exists between f m ratio and sludge settleability fig 3 changes in f m ratio under non controlled condition resulted in major population shifts which led to the dominance of certain microbial populations contributing different functions in granule stability thauera sp was observed to play a key role in the early stages of granule formation by acting like a coagulant bridging the bacteria however the overabundance of such eps producing bacteria particularly ps did not contribute to the long term granule structural stability in fact thauera sp showed an increase in the relative abundance during the early formation stages as well as reaggregation during reactor recovery periods followed by a decrease after maturation previous research on ags showed that eps composition can be used as indication to granule maturation and stability with pn ps ratio rather than the content of pn and ps showing a clear correlation to stability lashkarizadeh 2015 yang et al 2014 moreover a strong correlation was reported between secreted pn quantity and auto aggregation indices of individual isolates while no such correlation was noted between ps quantity and auto aggregation the decrease in pn productivity by isolates under high olr indicated that the eps structure of granules was weak thereby leading to granule breakdown adav et al 2010 in this regard the ps and pn contents were examined during the last phase of the experiment days 248 316 when f m ratio was 1 0 1 4 from earlier stages in the experiment this f m range was the most favorable for stable operation and maintenance of microbial diversity the ps content was 24 7 mg g vss for bound eps on day 263 with soluble ps of 13 8 mg l and pn content of 11 2 mg g vss pn ps ratio of 0 4 the relative abundance of thauera sp was 37 7 mean granule size of 320 2 62 7 μm with granulation percentage ranging from 52 to 68 was observed during days 248 265 the tightly bound pn content increased to 231 5 mg l at 31 8 mg g vss with a pn ps ratio of 2 3 on day 268 and a decline of thauera sp to 26 3 as granules dominated the reactor the tightly bound pn content increased to 255 3 mg g vss on day 288 with pn ps of 13 8 thauera sp relative abundance declined to 23 6 stable reactor performance was observed from day 288 to the end of the experiment day 316 characterized by an increase in the pn ps ratio to 14 9 and 20 0 on days 302 and 312 respectively thauera sp relative abundance was 38 3 and 37 1 on days 302 and 312 respectively granulation percentage stabilized around 85 90 with average particle size of 786 6 58 8 μm during days 290 316 it is worth mentioning that a decline in soluble ps was also observed from 13 8 to 1 6 mg l on day 263 to day 312 respectively this result agrees with yang et al 2014 who reported that pn ps ratio increased from 5 to 10 as granulation increased the three dimensional excitation and emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectra of tb eps on day 288 supplementary material fig s 2 showed peeks with very strong intensities at regions iv associated with soluble microbial products tryptophan pn like materials and other aromatic pn and v humic acid like material according to eem boundaries defined in chen et al 2003 unlike what was reported in adav et al 2010 regarding the limited ability of acinetobacter sp to tolerate cod 3000 mg l acinetobacter sp was also identified at 14 9 4 4 3 and 7 9 relative abundance on days 53 243 288 and 312 respectively at influent cod concentrations up to 7500 mg l these bacteria could have potentially contributed to granule aggregation however stable granules were observed in samples with very low relative abundance of acinetobacter sp day 30 0 4 moreover the highest relative abundance of acinetobacter sp appearing on day 53 14 9 was not sufficient to yield stable granules as the presence of methanogens in the granule core may have higher impact on granule disintegration based on our experiments f m ratio was identified as a decisive parameter in granule settleability and microbial dynamics in the reactor we argue that a combination of various microbial communities with microbial diversity and relative abundance of key microbial populations responsible for eps production i e thauera are crucial to granule formation and stability 4 conclusions aerobic granules were successfully developed in sbr under different influent cod concentrations 2000 7500 mg l the cod concentration at cultivation affected the period required for granule formation where higher olr promoted faster granule formation however after maturation sludge loading rate f m ratio appeared to play a decisive role in granule stability stable granules with outstanding settleability svi 50 ml g were maintained in the reactor at f m ratio between 0 5 and 1 4 gcod gss d an increase in the f m ratio above 2 2 gcod gss d led to fluffy granules bulking issues and washouts f m triggered the microbial selection community and diversity at high f m ratios denitrifiers and heterotrophic nitrifiers dominated the reactor it is apparent that eps secreting organisms thauera sp play a major role in both granule formation and long term granule structural integrity and stability with an optimum range of 25 35 relative abundance statistical analysis showed a significant main effect for f m ratio on granule settleability represented in svi at α 0 001 an exponential equation was developed between f m ratio and svi with r squared and the standard error of the regression s of 0 5 and 0 4 respectively the regression analysis showed the significance of the model and the coefficients at α 0 001 findings of this study provide important information on the operational boundaries of f m ratio and its impact on granule settleability microbial community composition the functional groups of microorganisms the proportions

19252,as a consequence of the suspended sediments in river water cake formation on the streambed and clogging of the aquifer may occur leading to a decline in the production yield of riverbank filtration systems particularly in highly turbid river waters however naturally occurring flow forces may induce sufficient scouring of the streambed thereby self regulating the thickness of the formed cake layer this study assessed the recovery of the infiltration capacity in a simulated physically clogged riverbank filtration system due to self cleansing processes a straight tilting flume provided with an infiltration column at the bottom was used for emulating clogging infiltration and self cleansing based on the presented research it may be concluded that the infiltration of a mixture of different sediments as found in natural water bodies can already be recovered at low shear stresses clay and silt behaved very differently due to the difference in cohesiveness clay was found to produce a persistent sticky cake layer whereas silt penetrated deeper into the bed both resulting in an absence of infiltration velocity recovery a cake layer of fine sand sediments was easiest to remove resulting in dune formation on the streambed however due to deep bed clogging by fine sand particles in a coarser streambed the infiltration velocity did not fully recover the interaction between mixed suspended sediments 5 clay 80 silt and 15 fine sand resulted in uneven erosion patterns during scouring of the streambed and recovery of the infiltration velocity is low altogether it may be concluded that natural recovery of infiltration capacity during river bank filtration of highly turbid waters is expected to occur as long as the river carries a mixture of suspended sediments and the sand of the streambed is not too coarse graphical abstract image 1 keywords infiltration recovery physical clogging riverbank filtration scouring self cleansing turbidity 1 introduction riverbank filtration rbf is a surface water treatment method for drinking water using extraction wells located near the river in order to ensure direct aquifer recharge as the surface water travels through the sediments contaminants such as pathogenic microorganisms are removed schubert 2003 rbf systems like other filters are to some degree vulnerable for clogging suspended particles in river water can affect the hydraulic conductivity of the bed and limit aquifer recharge caldwell 2006 streambed clogging may occur on the surface external clogging or within the porous media internal clogging experience from the netherlands has suggested that streambeds primarily consisting of gravels are at a far greater risk of clogging than those consisting primarily of finer grade materials stuyfzand et al 2006 also the properties of the suspended particles in the river such as particle size affect the extent and clogging degree of the streambed and aquifer pavelic et al 2011 veličković 2005 external clogging corresponds to the cake build up on the surface of the streambed due to the deposition of suspended solids which reduces its permeability internal clogging or deep bed clogging occurs when the suspended particles enter the porous media and get stuck in the subsurface before abstraction du et al 2014 once a cake is built up penetration of particles into the porous media is prevented and external or cake clogging rather than internal clogging will dominate fallah et al 2012 sacramento et al 2015 cake and deep bed clogging may also happen simultaneously mixed clogging caused by the movement of particles within the porous media and the accumulation of sediments in the upper layer du et al 2014 with this mixed clogging the hydraulic conductivity of the soil decreases over time but it decreases much faster in the top layer du et al 2014 cake clogging may be reversible but this is typically not the case for deep bed clogging pholkern et al 2015 seiler

process blaschke et al 2003 bouwer 2002 pavelic et al 2011 platzer and mauch 1997 mechanical clogging refers to air entrainment during recharge from vadose zone to the phreatic aquifer or gas binding

pores might lead to chemical clogging in the aquifer and nearby the abstraction well schubert 2002 biological clogging is caused by the accumulation of bacterial cells in the streambed baveye et al 1998 bouwer 2002 engesgaard et al 2006 the growth of these bacterial cells is dependent on physical chemical factors associated with both soil and water pavelic et al 2011 naturally occurring flow forces may induce sufficient scouring of the streambed thereby self regulating the thickness of the formed cake layer and restoring its hydraulic conductivity vertical sedimentation forces induce the deposition of particles on the streambed horizontal forces onset the resuspension of the deposited particles the extent of scouring is determined by the magnitude of the shear stress and the properties of the streambed and cake layer deposited onto the streambed scouring or self cleansing capacity of rbf systems is commonly assessed in terms of streambed particle size considering critical shear stress and the shear stress exerted by the river flow reported shear stress values typical for river streambeds range between 1 and 100 n m2 considering a value of 20 n m2 as reasonable hubbs 2006b however van rijn et al 2007 reported shear stress values for individual sediments ranging from 0 08 to 0 4 n m2 the shear stress for the mobilization in porous media of colloidal particles such as clay have been reported to range from 0 1 to 1 n m2 manga et al 2012 mays 2013 thus the incipient motion of sediments depends on critical shear stress which is a function of streambed armor layer characteristics for particles finer than 62 μm the critical shear stress increases as particle size decreases due to the cohesive effects van rijn et al 2007 erosion and deposition exhibit dissimilar behavior for cohesive and non cohesive sediments winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 cake layers composed from the deposition of cohesive materials carried by the rivers will increase the resistance to erosive processes meaning higher shear stresses to move the sediments deposited on the streambed in addition cohesive sediments have a different shear stress for deposition than for erosion krishnappan 2007 the cake layer may affect the surface water groundwater interaction and therefore may influence the abstraction capacity yield by altering the permeability of the streambed packman and mackay 2003 the mechanisms affecting the infiltration velocity based on the movement and settlement of particles on streambeds and the streambed aquifer clogging are represented in fig 1 the streambed infiltration velocity q thus depends on the characteristics of the streambed sediments and the suspended sediments being transported by the river and it is expected to vary according to the characteristics of the flow i e streambed velocity and flow velocity profile across the river leading to the deposition and resuspension of particles the minimum shear stress τ c is defined by the gravitational and cohesive forces that resist particle motion in ideal conditions when the friction velocity on the sediment bed is greater than the threshold velocity sediment particles on the bed will become mobilized the variables that influence the infiltration velocity in the porous media considering the clogging and self cleansing processes are e g cunningham et al 1987 wang 1999

achieve this physical modeling with an experimental rbf set up was conducted in order to assess the effect of flow velocity particle size of the streambed media suspended particle diameter and suspended particle concentration on the infiltration velocity during clogging and self cleansing special attention was paid in this study to differentiate between cake and deep bed clogging 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a straight tilting flume with two channels duplicate was used for simulation of the river flow fig 2 infiltration columns placed at the bottom were used to determine the effect of variable shear stress conditions on self cleansing and infiltration the channels had dimensions of 500 cm length by 19 cm width and were constructed of smoothed wood the lateral walls were made of wood and plexiglas the infiltration columns were made of transparent plexiglas 50 cm long and 10 8 cm id the columns were equipped with four piezometers for the monitoring of head loss over the height of the porous media and four sampling ports placed 10 cm from each other the bottom of the channels was roughened by gluing 0 2 0 8 mm sand onto them leaving the sides smooth flow characteristics were measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter em turbidity was measured at the different ports of the columns using a turbidity meter hach 2100p the infiltration velocity q q a where q v t and a is the area of column perpendicular to the water flow and pressures were monitored for the duration of the experiments to assess porous media clogging and infiltration recovery the experiments were conducted at room temperature about 20 c 2 2 sediments 2 2 1 suspended sediments the suspended sediments were selected based on characteristics of the natural sediments identified in a highly turbid river cauca river in cali colombia gutiérrez et al 2016 where particle size distribution and specific surface was determined by wet laser diffraction instrument model hydro 2000sm malvern sediment properties for dry and rainy conditions are summarized in table 1 considering the characteristics described in table 1 the whole sample of sediments collected in the cauca river may be regarded as inorganic non cohesive therefore inorganic fine sediments were used to simulate the natural suspended sediments in the cauca river imerys polwhite e clay 0 5 10 μm d s 50 3 5 μm m300

geophysical union 2 2 2 streambed material three streambed aquifer configurations were used 1 streambed and columns from coarse sand from sibelco 1 0 1 6 mm d 50 1 36 mm 2 streambed from medium sand from sibelco 0 2 0 8 mm d 50 0 61 mm and columns from coarse sand 1 0 1 6 mm d 50 1 36 mm and 3 streambed and columns from medium sand 0 2 0 8 mm d 50 0 61 mm the grain sizes were selected in order to emulate an alluvial formation based on the characteristics found in the cauca river section next to the main water treatment plant of the city of cali colombia cvc and universidad del valle 2004a 2 3 experimental procedure the experiments consisted of two subsequent phases 1 clogging of zone b see figs 2 and 3 followed by 2 scouring conditions flowing from zone a to zone c the clogging experiments of the streambed in zone b were conducted for two sediment concentrations 1 g l and 6 g l an initial infiltration velocity of 6 m d and two streambed media d 50 0 61 mm and d 50 1 36 mm after packing the columns the soil was saturated from the bottom up with tap water which was pumped at a 2 ml min constant flow with a peristaltic pump watson marlow sci q 205s ca the bottom of the column was connected to a saturated tube discharging to the atmosphere at an elevation above the top of the streambed but below of the water level in the channel figs 2 and 3 the scouring experiments were carried out with tap water at different shear stresses physicochemical characteristics of the tap water used during the experiments from seven water samples were ph 7 9 8 0 ionic strength 0 00724 0

ph found in the cauca river 6 5 7 5 cvc and universidad del valle 2004b as mentioned before imerys polwhite e kaolinite was used for representing the clay fraction of the suspended sediments for kaolinite at similar ph and sar conditions as the used tap water critical coagulation concentrations of about 0 5 0 7 mmolc l have been reported goldberg et al 1991 2 3 1 streambed critical shear stress the shear stress is the force of moving water against the streambed of the channel τ ρ w g h s where g is the gravitational force h is the water depth in the channel and s is the water surface slope the shear stress for incipient motion of the streambed material was determined by placing 5 cm height of the streambed material fig 2 onto the flume bottom and then moving water at different bed slopes and flows different shear stresses until bed movement occurred the shear stress in the flume that resulted in bed movement was established as the critical shear stress τ c for the clean streambed a 14 cm constant water level h during the experiments was maintained by using an adjustable weir at the downstream end of the flume and by modifying the water discharge and the flume slope 2 3 2 clogging experiments turbid influent water fig 3 was pumped into the flume from a reservoir zone b was isolated from the rest of the flume by wooden plates in order to clog solely this region and the infiltration column during the clogging experiments the turbid solution in the reservoir was thoroughly mixed during the whole experiment additionally the entering turbid solution in zone b was continuously mixed by using a four bladed propeller stirrer placed at the upper zone of the water level at a velocity fast enough to achieve a uniform particle distribution and slow enough to allow the deposition of particles and avoid the disturbance of the bed the water level in zone b was controlled by using a laser sensor optoncdt 1302 synthetic turbid solutions were infiltrated into the columns 1 g l and 6 g l an initial filtration velocity 6 m d was used based on values reported in the literature for rbf systems dawe 2006 hubbs 2006a the initial filtration velocity was achieved by maintaining a constant head δh between the water level in the flume and the outlet level in the columns fig 3 in addition to the different tested concentrations four different suspended particle sizes were used to prepare the turbid solutions 1 clay 0 5 10 μm d s 50 3 5 μm 2 silt 3 40 μm d s 50 17 μm 3 fine sand 63 180 μm d s 50 150 μm and 4 mixed clay silt and fine sand 0 5 180 μm the mixed material was comprised of 5 clay 80 silt and 15 fine sand in agreement with the composition of the sediments in the cauca river gutiérrez et al 2016 the experiments ran for periods between 24 and 168 h depending on the sediment concentration the pressure was continuously monitored through the piezometers during the experiments water samples 15 ml were extracted from each sampler port by using a multichannel peristaltic pump watson marlow sci q 205s ca at a slow flow rate 1 ml min per channel in order to avoid disturbances of the porous media and deposited sediments turbidity values were determined through a portable turbidimeter 2100q from hach tap water was used to prepare the turbid solutions that were continuously stirred in order to ensure their homogeneity the height of the cake layer was continuously measured by using a metric ruler taped to the transparent plexiglas wall zone b 2 3 3 infiltration and self cleansing experiments movable bed conditions were used in zones a b and c of the flume fig 2 zone a had a 360 cm length designed to achieve a fully developed fluid flow zone b had a 40 cm length including the 10 8 cm diameter of the column zone c had a 100 cm length designed to observe the deposition and resuspension of sediments zones a b and c were covered with 5 cm of the streambed material self cleansing was assessed based on the threshold shields parameter θ c which is a non dimensional number indicating the initiation of sediment transport in channels the θ c was calculated from the experimentally determined critical shear stress τ c found in equation 1 and verified from the theoretical equation 2 by soulsby and whitehouse 1997 1 θ c τ c g ρ s ρ w d 50 2 θ c 0 3 1 1 2 d 0 055 1 exp 0 02 d where the dimensionless grain size d is defined as 3 d g ρ s ρ w 1 ρ w μ 2 1 3 d 50 three shields parameters θ were evaluated approximately 0 5θ c θ c 2θ c depending on the bed particle size during the self cleansing experiments the assessed θ values were selected based on both the experimentally determined τ c and the calculated threshold shields parameter for each streambed both the experimentally determined applying eq 1 and theoretically calculated applying eq 2 τ c gave values of 0 72 and 0 66 n2 m for d 50 1 36 mm and d 50 0 61 mm respectively julien 1998 reported values between 0 47 and 1 3 n m2 and 0 27 0 47 n m2 for very coarse sand 1 2 mm and coarse sand 0 5 1 mm respectively in order to make the experiments comparable three shear velocities u τ ρ w were assessed 0 017 m s 0 029 m s and 0 041 m s corresponding to flow velocities in the channels u q a where q is the volumetric flow in the channel and a is the transversal area to the water flow of 0 318 m s 0 327 m s and 0 342 m s respectively for both streambeds considering critical shields parameters θ c 0 034 and 0 031 for d 50 1 36 mm and d 50 0 61 mm respectively julien 1998 reported values from 0 029 to 0 039 and 0 029 and 0 033 for very coarse sand 1 2 mm and coarse sand 0 5 1 mm respectively each streambed velocity was applied during approximately 3 h in order to avoid the interference from ripples and dunes formations in zone b specific discharges and water pressures were monitored in the infiltration columns as indicators of clogging 3 results 3 1 cake and deep bed clogging 3 1 1 cake layer formation fig 4 a presents the variations in the cake layer formation rate mm cake height per suspended sediment load mg q s e d t where t is time for different suspended sediment sizes d s and under two different suspended sediment concentrations sed from fig 4a it can be observed that the fastest cake formation occurred when passing clay through the porous media in addition for all the suspended sediments except for clay a higher cake layer formation rate occurred at the lower sediment concentration the cake layer formation rate is given as mm mg sediment load and therefore not related to time which means that although at higher sediment concentration the cake layer formation is faster the relative contribution of passing suspended sediments to cake layer formation is smaller except for clay the cake layer formation rate as a function of the streambed particle size is presented in fig 4b a higher cake formation rate for the same streambed column configuration streambed d 50 0 61 mm columns d 50 0 61 mm than for the different streambed column configuration streambed d 50 0 61 mm columns d 50 1 36 mm was observed for the large streambed particle size d 50 1 36 mm no cake layer was formed for the low sediment concentration of 1 g l for the fine streambed particle size d 50 0 61 mm a higher cake layer formation velocity occurred at the low sediment concentration 3 1 2 deep bed clogging turbidity measurements were done over the column height as indicator for assessing deep bed clogging the values shown in fig 5 correspond to the average of samples withdrawn each 3 4 h during the run of each experiment the water containing clay particles 0 5 10 μm presented the lowest turbidity measurements over the column heights for both sediment concentrations for the silt size particles 3 40 μm at the higher sediment concentration 6 g l the turbidity increased as the travel distance increased the turbidity for both sediment concentrations and both streambed particle sizes over the column height is illustrated in fig 5 for the larger streambed particle size d 50 1 36 mm the turbidity was stable over the height of the column with an average of 6 3 ntu and 31 9 ntu for 1 and 6 g l respectively for both sediment concentrations higher turbidity values were observed in the top 35 cm of the column with the smaller streambed particle size d 50 0 61 mm than with the larger streambed particle size d 50 1 36 mm in fig 6 the permeability k changes per each segment of the columns are shown as relative permeabilities k between ports divided by the clean bed permeability k o as a function of the injected sediment load as observed in fig 6 the higher permeability reduction occurred in the first 15 cm top layer for all the suspended sediment sizes tested which is linked to cake clogging this happened faster at the lower suspended sediments concentration deep bed clogging represented by the permeability reduction in the lower segments was evidenced for all sediment sizes being higher as the particle size decreased clay silt fine sand for fine sand the top layer was not clogged nor deep bed clogging was observed at the higher suspended sediment concentration fig 6c the mixture of suspended sediments presented the highest and fastest cake clogging occurrence and the lowest deep bed clogging except for fine sand 3 2 infiltration velocity during clogging fig 7 presents the variations in the infiltration velocity for different turbid solutions in relation to the infiltrated sediment mass q q o q s e d t in m d mg this infiltration velocity decline was higher for a sediment concentration of 1 g l compared to 6 g l apart for clay this is in line with the faster development of cake layer at 1 g l velocity expressed per sediment load it must be taken into account that the analysis was realized using suspended sediment load instead of time to make them comparable for fine sand no reduction of the infiltration velocity occurred at 6 g l whilst a slight reduction was observed for 1 g l in fig 7b the changes in infiltration velocities are compared for two streambed particle sizes d 50 1 36 mm and d 50 0 61 mm where the column particle size was the same for both d 50 1 36 mm the mixture of suspended sediments was used for this experiment higher infiltration velocity decline per weight of sediment load was observed at the lower sediment concentration when comparing the infiltration velocity decline for mixed sediments in the same particle sizes for both column and streambed d 50 0 61 mm versus different particle sizes streambed d 50 0 61 mm columns d 50 1 36 mm a much larger infiltration velocity decline was obtained for the different particle sizes 3 3 cake layer scouring the removal of the cake layer by scouring forces was registered during the assessment of three shields parameters θ 0 5θ c θ c and 2θ c compared to no flow with τ c 0 and subsequently θ 0 the shear velocities were of 0 017 0 029 and 0 041 m s respectively the tests were conducted for the medium sand streambed d 50 0 61 mm fig 8 illustrates the cake layer removal as a function of streambed velocities for the cake layers composed of different suspended sediments for the experiments conducted with clay particles 0 5 10 μm a relatively high removal 32 46 of the cake layer was observed at θ 0 5θ c however little additional cake layer was being removed at θ 1 and no extra removal was observed at θ 2θ c at the higher sediment concentration a much thicker cake layer was formed which also resulted in a thicker remaining clay layer after scouring 8 mm compared to clay the cake layer made of silt 3 40 μm was consistently harder to remove though at each increased shear stress a fraction of the layer was removed most silt particles from the removed cake layer were re suspended in the water but it was also observed that silt particles were partly re settled in the subsequent zone c fig 2 the re settlement suggests a potential clogging effect downstream the evaluated zone at the same time the newly cleaned streambed may become clogged with material scoured upstream for the fine sand cake layer 63 180 μm most of the deposited sediments were easily removed at the lower streambed velocity as observed in fig 8 although the fine sand sediments were moved from their initial position the formation of ripples and dunes were observed in zone c as a consequence scouring of the original streambed was also onset d 50 0 61 mm the cake layer formed by the mixture of sediments presented the highest resistance to erosion of all the suspended sediments assessed with only 23 31 of the cake layer being removed 3 4 infiltration velocity after scouring fig 9 compares the recovery of the infiltration velocity during the self cleansing experiments relative infiltration velocities as a function of the initial infiltration velocity q q 0 i e at clean bed conditions are shown the results for θ c 0 correspond to the infiltration velocity of the clogged streambed before starting the self cleansing experiments in none of the experiments independent of suspended sediment type or concentration the infiltration velocity recovered to its initial capacity regardless of the bed shear stress applied although the remainder of the cake layer after bed scouring was the thickest for the mixed suspended sediments fig 8 comparable to the clay layer the flow velocity recovery was the highest 84 96 for the mixed suspended sediments at both concentrations compared to the uniform suspended sediment sizes fig 9a during the clogging experiments with the mixed suspended sediments cake layer cracks were observed for the lower suspended sediments concentration the recovery was higher even if the infiltration velocity reduction during the clogging experiment was high fig 7 though the cake layer of the largest uniform suspended sediment sizes fine sand 63 180 μm was completely removed for both concentrations no recovery of the infiltration velocity was obtained as observed in fig 9b no differences in the infiltration recovery existed between both streambed sizes at the lower concentration on the other hand a higher infiltration capacity occurred for the smaller streambed size d 50 0 61 mm at the higher suspended sediment concentration which may be explained by movement of the original streambed as cracking of the cake layer was observed 4 discussion 4 1 cake clogging or deep bed clogging when comparing the different types of suspended sediments deep bed clogging was observed most predominantly for the experiments with silt the low cake formation velocity and the high infiltration velocity decline for silt particles at the higher suspended sediments concentration is linked to the non cohesive nature of the silt winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 where the weakness of physicochemical processes limits the attachment of silt particles to each other and onto the sand particles therefore the entrapped particles can be easily remobilized by the water flow reaching lower layers leading to deep bed clogging the clay particles were found to be mostly retained in the cake layer which may then be explained by the cohesiveness of clay particles krishnappan 2007 the cohesive nature of clay leads to particles aggregation of clay sediments floc formation particularly at high concentrations klassen et al 2013 therefore although both turbidity values tested during this research were high 1 g l and 6 g l the findings show that the 1 g l suspended solids led to higher cake layer formation velocities for non cohesive particles while 6 g l suspended solids concentration was favorable for higher cake layer formation velocities in cohesive particles having the opposite effect on the formation of deep bed clogging the suspended sediments mixture pinpoints the effect of the interparticle forces acting among the sediments e g van der waals and the interaction between them and the bed particles leading to larger particles with the ability to be retained on the top layer cake filtration due to the clay content also the interaction amongst different suspended particles onsets new clogging mechanisms e g 1 entrapment and sedimentation of fine sand sediments in small voids 2 entrapment of silt particles in existing voids and new voids because of the trapped fine sand and 3 straining hydrodynamic bridging and interparticle forces of clay and the retained suspended sediments veličković 2005 when reviewing the cake layer and deep bed turbidity measurements figs 4 and 5 the fine sand behaved very similar to the mixed sediments nevertheless the low infiltration velocity reduction for the fine sand experiments reveals that although the cake layer may have had the same thickness it was more permeable than is the case for mixed sediments different clogging mechanisms influence the infiltration capacity reduction in relation to the streambed size the smaller voids due to the smaller bed particle size are likely to retain more suspended sediment particles by entrapment winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 in this case mixed bed clogging occurs where cake clogging plays the most important role in the precluding of the water passage through the media as reported for slow sand filtration grace et al 2016 on the other hand deep bed clogging is the dominant mechanism for the large streambed size the larger voids have a larger storage capacity for particles and then enhance the mobility of particles into the media before clogging veličković 2005 favoring deep bed clogging occurrence this behavior has been widely reported for rapid sand filtration where suspended and colloidal particles are depth filtered ripperger et al 2012 the presence of larger voids can enhance the mobility of fine particles because of the higher flow velocities leading to higher hydrodynamic forces and to the weaker interparticle bonding forces jacobsen et al 1997 reddi et al 2000 the weak support exerted by the filling material of the columns which being larger than the particles of the streambed was not able to retain the particles previously entrapped and due to the changes in flow velocities between the transition from d 50 0 61 mm streambed to d 50 1 36 mm column contributed to sudden releases of particles 4 2 self cleansing of cake layer as stated by various researchers bed scouring depends on streambed particle size caldwell 2006 stuyfzand et al 2006 the suspended particle type has demonstrated to be the most important variable governing the self cleansing of the streambed for an uncovered clean streambed e g absence of plants biofilm the initial high removal velocity found with the cake layer made of clay may be referred as entrainment and or floc erosion the absence of additional removal may be related to the interaction strength between the sandy bed and the mud clay layer due to the cohesive and adhesive characteristics of the clay leading to a much higher erosion threshold jacobs et al 2011 however it must be noted that a recirculating flume was used during the experiments thus the resuspended clay conveyed to a turbidity current which could have affected the cake layer erodibility by the so called hindered erosion winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 the much thicker cake layer formation obtained at the higher suspended sediments concentration highly impacted the initial scouring of the clay cake this is related to the lower cake layer compression on the top layer and therefore a weaker strength to erosion mahdi and holdich 2013 mays and hunt 2005 the non cohesive nature of silt leads to a weak interaction between the bed and the cake layer which is favorable for the erodibility of the cake formation the ripples and dunes formations that occurred for the fine sand cake layer induced mass erosion of both the cake layer and the bed due to the wave induced shear stress winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 the continuous removal but the high resistance to erosion of the cake layer made of the mixture of fine sediments is explained by the strong interparticle forces among the suspended sediments avoiding a high resuspension velocity as observed when sediments were tested individually our findings indicate an important interaction between the streambed and the suspended sediment size the smaller the bed particle size the higher the interaction strength this behavior is related to the stronger physicochemical forces from small particle sizes acting to preserve the particles joined the infiltration velocity never recovered to its initial capacity regardless of the bed shear stress assessed an overview of cake layer removal and infiltration velocity recovery per sediment type is presented in table 2 for the homogeneous suspended sediments clay silt fine sand the infiltration velocity did not show any increase even if the cake layers were partly removed for the mixed suspended sediments 5 clay 80 silt and 15 fine sand cake layer cracks during the clogging experiments were observed therefore uneven erosion patterns occurred during scouring experiments caused by the presence of the existing cake cracks increasing the longitudinal cracks extent on cake layer formation jacobs et al 2011 even if a high mobilization of the mixture cake layer during the scouring experiments occurred fig 8 the immediate infiltration velocity recovery is therefore probably associated with preferential flows caused by the ameliorated cake cracking on the surface the entrapment of particles in the deeper voids can be considered deep bed clogging and consequently there is a reduced chance of natural recovery of infiltration capacity because of the scouring of these particles compared to cake clogging goldschneider et al 2007 in smaller streambed particle sizes the clogging particles cannot penetrate as deeply and cake clogging occurs brunke 1999 veličković 2005 it was found that the sediment concentration affected the occurrence of cake and or deep bed clogging depending on the type of sediment which in turn influenced the infiltration recovery thus for clay particles the higher concentration favored the cake layer formation limiting the deep bed clogging while for silt fine sand and the mixture of sediments the higher sediment concentration the lower the cake layer formation velocity leading to higher deep bed clogging the concentration did not show an evident effect on the self cleansing of the cake layer on sediments other than clay which suggests that the infiltration recovery was merely a function of deep bed clogging 5 conclusions based on the presented research it may be concluded that during simulated riverbank filtration high recovery of the infiltration velocity 84 96 at low shear stresses was possible for high turbidity water with a mixture of different sediments as found in natural water bodies clay and silt behaved very differently due to the difference in cohesiveness clay was found to produce a persistent sticky cake layer whereas silt penetrated deeper into the bed both resulting in an absence of infiltration velocity recovery the cake layer of fine sand sediments was easiest to remove resulting in dune formation on the streambed nevertheless due to deep bed clogging by the sand particles in the coarser streambed the infiltration velocity did not recover the interaction between the mixed suspended sediments 5 clay 80 silt and 15 fine sand resulted in uneven erosion patterns during scouring of the streambed allowing for the infiltration velocity to recover to 84 96 altogether it may be concluded that natural recovery of infiltration capacity during river bank filtration of highly turbid waters is expected to occur as long as the river carries a mixture of suspended sediments the fine

19252,as a consequence of the suspended sediments in river water cake formation on the streambed and clogging of the aquifer may occur leading to a decline in the production yield of riverbank filtration systems particularly in highly turbid river waters however naturally occurring flow forces may induce sufficient scouring of the streambed thereby self regulating the thickness of the formed cake layer this study assessed the recovery of the infiltration capacity in a simulated physically clogged riverbank filtration system due to self cleansing processes a straight tilting flume provided with an infiltration column at the bottom was used for emulating clogging infiltration and self cleansing based on the presented research it may be concluded that the infiltration of a mixture of different sediments as found in natural water bodies can already be recovered at low shear stresses clay and silt behaved very differently due to the difference in cohesiveness clay was found to produce a persistent sticky cake layer whereas silt penetrated deeper into the bed both resulting in an absence of infiltration velocity recovery a cake layer of fine sand sediments was easiest to remove resulting in dune formation on the streambed however due to deep bed clogging by fine sand particles in a coarser streambed the infiltration velocity did not fully recover the interaction between mixed suspended sediments 5 clay 80 silt and 15 fine sand resulted in uneven erosion patterns during scouring of the streambed and recovery of the infiltration velocity is low altogether it may be concluded that natural recovery of infiltration capacity during river bank filtration of highly turbid waters is expected to occur as long as the river carries a mixture of suspended sediments and the sand of the streambed is not too coarse graphical abstract image 1 keywords infiltration recovery physical clogging riverbank filtration scouring self cleansing turbidity 1 introduction riverbank filtration rbf is a surface water treatment method for drinking water using extraction wells located near the river in order to ensure direct aquifer recharge as the surface water travels through the sediments contaminants such as pathogenic microorganisms are removed schubert 2003 rbf systems like other filters are to some degree vulnerable for clogging suspended particles in river water can affect the hydraulic conductivity of the bed and limit aquifer recharge caldwell 2006 streambed clogging may occur on the surface external clogging or within the porous media internal clogging experience from the netherlands has suggested that streambeds primarily consisting of gravels are at a far greater risk of clogging than those consisting primarily of finer grade materials stuyfzand et al 2006 also the properties of the suspended particles in the river such as particle size affect the extent and clogging degree of the streambed and aquifer pavelic et al 2011 veličković 2005 external clogging corresponds to the cake build up on the surface of the streambed due to the deposition of suspended solids which reduces its permeability internal clogging or deep bed clogging occurs when the suspended particles enter the porous media and get stuck in the subsurface before abstraction du et al 2014 once a cake is built up penetration of particles into the porous media is prevented and external or cake clogging rather than internal clogging will dominate fallah et al 2012 sacramento et al 2015 cake and deep bed clogging may also happen simultaneously mixed clogging caused by the movement of particles within the porous media and the accumulation of sediments in the upper layer du et al 2014 with this mixed clogging the hydraulic conductivity of the soil decreases over time but it decreases much faster in the top layer du et al 2014 cake clogging may be reversible but this is typically not the case for deep bed clogging pholkern et al 2015 seiler and gat 2007 physical mechanical chemical and biological clogging are the main obstruction mechanisms occurring in the streambed the physical clogging occurs when inorganic and organic suspended solids in the river e g clay silt particles algae cells microorganisms flocs become trapped in the streambed pore channels as water flows from the river and through the aquifer bouwer 2002 caldwell 2006 hubbs 2006a pavelic et al 2011 schubert 2002 particle size distribution and suspended solids concentration in the river water are considered the main factors affecting the physical clogging process blaschke et al 2003 bouwer 2002 pavelic et al 2011 platzer and mauch 1997 mechanical clogging refers to air entrainment during recharge from vadose zone to the phreatic aquifer or gas binding

pores might lead to chemical clogging in the aquifer and nearby the abstraction well schubert 2002 biological clogging is caused by the accumulation of bacterial cells in the streambed baveye et al 1998 bouwer 2002 engesgaard et al 2006 the growth of these bacterial cells is dependent on physical chemical factors associated with both soil and water pavelic et al 2011 naturally occurring flow forces may induce sufficient scouring of the streambed thereby self regulating the thickness of the formed cake layer and restoring its hydraulic conductivity vertical sedimentation forces induce the deposition of particles on the streambed horizontal forces onset the resuspension of the deposited particles the extent of scouring is determined by the magnitude of the shear stress and the properties of the streambed and cake layer deposited onto the streambed scouring or self cleansing capacity of rbf systems is commonly assessed in terms of streambed particle size considering critical shear stress and the shear stress exerted by the river flow reported shear stress values typical for river streambeds range between 1 and 100 n m2 considering a value of 20 n m2 as reasonable hubbs 2006b however van rijn et al 2007 reported shear stress values for individual sediments ranging from 0 08 to 0 4 n m2 the shear stress for the mobilization in porous media of colloidal particles such as clay have been reported to range from 0 1 to 1 n m2 manga et al 2012 mays 2013 thus the incipient motion of sediments depends on critical shear stress which is a function of streambed armor layer characteristics for particles finer than 62 μm the critical shear stress increases as particle size decreases due to the cohesive effects van rijn et al 2007 erosion and deposition exhibit dissimilar behavior for cohesive and non cohesive sediments winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 cake layers composed from the deposition of cohesive materials carried by the rivers will increase the resistance to erosive processes meaning higher shear stresses to move the sediments deposited on the streambed in addition cohesive sediments have a different shear stress for deposition than for erosion krishnappan 2007 the cake layer may affect the surface water groundwater interaction and therefore may influence the abstraction capacity yield by altering the permeability of the streambed packman and mackay 2003 the mechanisms affecting the infiltration velocity based on the movement and settlement of particles on streambeds and the streambed aquifer clogging are represented in fig 1 the streambed infiltration velocity q thus depends on the characteristics of the streambed sediments and the suspended sediments being transported by the river and it is expected to vary according to the characteristics of the flow i e streambed velocity and flow velocity profile across the river leading to the deposition and resuspension of particles the minimum shear stress τ c is defined by the gravitational and cohesive forces that resist particle motion in ideal conditions when the friction velocity on the sediment bed is greater than the threshold velocity sediment particles on the bed will become mobilized the variables that influence the infiltration velocity in the porous media considering the clogging and self cleansing processes are e g cunningham et al 1987 wang 1999

achieve this physical modeling with an experimental rbf set up was conducted in order to assess the effect of flow velocity particle size of the streambed media suspended particle diameter and suspended particle concentration on the infiltration velocity during clogging and self cleansing special attention was paid in this study to differentiate between cake and deep bed clogging 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a straight tilting flume with two channels duplicate was used for simulation of the river flow fig 2 infiltration columns placed at the bottom were used to determine the effect of variable shear stress conditions on self cleansing and infiltration the channels had dimensions of 500 cm length by 19 cm width and were constructed of smoothed wood the lateral walls were made of wood and plexiglas the infiltration columns were made of transparent plexiglas 50 cm long and 10 8 cm id the columns were equipped with four piezometers for the monitoring of head loss over the height of the porous media and four sampling ports placed 10 cm from each other the bottom of the channels was roughened by gluing 0 2 0 8 mm sand onto them leaving the sides smooth flow characteristics were measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter em turbidity was measured at the different ports of the columns using a turbidity meter hach 2100p the infiltration velocity q q a where q v t and a is the area of column perpendicular to the water flow and pressures were monitored for the duration of the experiments to assess porous media clogging and infiltration recovery the experiments were conducted at room temperature about 20 c 2 2 sediments 2 2 1 suspended sediments the suspended sediments were selected based on characteristics of the natural sediments identified in a highly turbid river cauca river in cali colombia gutiérrez et al 2016 where particle size distribution and specific surface was determined by wet laser diffraction instrument model hydro 2000sm malvern sediment properties for dry and rainy conditions are summarized in table 1 considering the characteristics described in table 1 the whole sample of sediments collected in the cauca river may be regarded as inorganic non cohesive therefore inorganic fine sediments were used to simulate the natural suspended sediments in the cauca river imerys polwhite e clay 0 5 10 μm d s 50 3 5 μm m300

geophysical union 2 2 2 streambed material three streambed aquifer configurations were used 1 streambed and columns from coarse sand from sibelco 1 0 1 6 mm d 50 1 36 mm 2 streambed from medium sand from sibelco 0 2 0 8 mm d 50 0 61 mm and columns from coarse sand 1 0 1 6 mm d 50 1 36 mm and 3 streambed and columns from medium sand 0 2 0 8 mm d 50 0 61 mm the grain sizes were selected in order to emulate an alluvial formation based on the characteristics found in the cauca river section next to the main water treatment plant of the city of cali colombia cvc and universidad del valle 2004a 2 3 experimental procedure the experiments consisted of two subsequent phases 1 clogging of zone b see figs 2 and 3 followed by 2 scouring conditions flowing from zone a to zone c the clogging experiments of the streambed in zone b were conducted for two sediment concentrations 1 g l and 6 g l an initial infiltration velocity of 6 m d and two streambed media d 50 0 61 mm and d 50 1 36 mm after packing the columns the soil was saturated from the bottom up with tap water which was pumped at a 2 ml min constant flow with a peristaltic pump watson marlow sci q 205s ca the bottom of the column was connected to a saturated tube discharging to the atmosphere at an elevation above the top of the streambed but below of the water level in the channel figs 2 and 3 the scouring experiments were carried out with tap water at different shear stresses physicochemical characteristics of the tap water used during the experiments from seven water samples were ph 7 9 8 0 ionic strength 0 00724 0

ph found in the cauca river 6 5 7 5 cvc and universidad del valle 2004b as mentioned before imerys polwhite e kaolinite was used for representing the clay fraction of the suspended sediments for kaolinite at similar ph and sar conditions as the used tap water critical coagulation concentrations of about 0 5 0 7 mmolc l have been reported goldberg et al 1991 2 3 1 streambed critical shear stress the shear stress is the force of moving water against the streambed of the channel τ ρ w g h s where g is the gravitational force h is the water depth in the channel and s is the water surface slope the shear stress for incipient motion of the streambed material was determined by placing 5 cm height of the streambed material fig 2 onto the flume bottom and then moving water at different bed slopes and flows different shear stresses until bed movement occurred the shear stress in the flume that resulted in bed movement was established as the critical shear stress τ c for the clean streambed a 14 cm constant water level h during the experiments was maintained by using an adjustable weir at the downstream end of the flume and by modifying the water discharge and the flume slope 2 3 2 clogging experiments turbid influent water fig 3 was pumped into the flume from a reservoir zone b was isolated from the rest of the flume by wooden plates in order to clog solely this region and the infiltration column during the clogging experiments the turbid solution in the reservoir was thoroughly mixed during the whole experiment additionally the entering turbid solution in zone b was continuously mixed by using a four bladed propeller stirrer placed at the upper zone of the water level at a velocity fast enough to achieve a uniform particle distribution and slow enough to allow the deposition of particles and avoid the disturbance of the bed the water level in zone b was controlled by using a laser sensor optoncdt 1302 synthetic turbid solutions were infiltrated into the columns 1 g l and 6 g l an initial filtration velocity 6 m d was used based on values reported in the literature for rbf systems dawe 2006 hubbs 2006a the initial filtration velocity was achieved by maintaining a constant head δh between the water level in the flume and the outlet level in the columns fig 3 in addition to the different tested concentrations four different suspended particle sizes were used to prepare the turbid solutions 1 clay 0 5 10 μm d s 50 3 5 μm 2 silt 3 40 μm d s 50 17 μm 3 fine sand 63 180 μm d s 50 150 μm and 4 mixed clay silt and fine sand 0 5 180 μm the mixed material was comprised of 5 clay 80 silt and 15 fine sand in agreement with the composition of the sediments in the cauca river gutiérrez et al 2016 the experiments ran for periods between 24 and 168 h depending on the sediment concentration the pressure was continuously monitored through the piezometers during the experiments water samples 15 ml were extracted from each sampler port by using a multichannel peristaltic pump watson marlow sci q 205s ca at a slow flow rate 1 ml min per channel in order to avoid disturbances of the porous media and deposited sediments turbidity values were determined through a portable turbidimeter 2100q from hach tap water was used to prepare the turbid solutions that were continuously stirred in order to ensure their homogeneity the height of the cake layer was continuously measured by using a metric ruler taped to the transparent plexiglas wall zone b 2 3 3 infiltration and self cleansing experiments movable bed conditions were used in zones a b and c of the flume fig 2 zone a had a 360 cm length designed to achieve a fully developed fluid flow zone b had a 40 cm length including the 10 8 cm diameter of the column zone c had a 100 cm length designed to observe the deposition and resuspension of sediments zones a b and c were covered with 5 cm of the streambed material self cleansing was assessed based on the threshold shields parameter θ c which is a non dimensional number indicating the initiation of sediment transport in channels the θ c was calculated from the experimentally determined critical shear stress τ c found in equation 1

w 1 ρ w μ 2 1 3 d 50 three shields parameters θ were evaluated approximately 0 5θ c θ c 2θ c depending on the bed particle size during the self cleansing experiments the assessed θ values were selected based on both the experimentally determined τ c and the calculated threshold shields parameter for each streambed both the experimentally determined applying eq 1 and theoretically calculated applying eq 2 τ c gave values of 0 72 and 0 66 n2 m for d 50 1 36 mm and d 50 0 61 mm respectively julien 1998 reported values between 0 47 and 1 3 n m2 and 0 27 0 47 n m2 for very coarse sand 1 2 mm and coarse sand 0 5 1 mm respectively in order to make the experiments comparable three shear velocities u τ ρ w were assessed 0 017 m s 0 029 m s and 0 041 m s corresponding to flow velocities in the channels u q a where q is the volumetric flow in the channel and a is the transversal area to the water flow of 0 318 m s 0 327 m s and 0 342 m s respectively for both streambeds considering critical shields parameters θ c 0 034 and 0 031 for d 50 1 36 mm and d 50 0 61 mm respectively julien 1998 reported values from 0 029 to 0 039 and 0 029 and 0 033 for very coarse sand 1 2 mm and coarse sand 0 5 1 mm respectively each streambed velocity was applied during approximately 3 h in order to avoid the interference from ripples and dunes formations in zone b specific discharges and water pressures were monitored in the infiltration columns as indicators of clogging 3 results 3 1 cake and deep bed clogging 3 1 1 cake layer formation fig 4 a presents the variations in the cake layer formation rate mm cake height per suspended sediment load mg q s e d t where t is time for different suspended sediment sizes d s and under two different suspended sediment concentrations sed from fig 4a it can be observed that the fastest cake formation occurred when passing clay through the porous media in addition for all the suspended sediments except for clay a higher cake layer formation rate occurred at the lower sediment concentration the cake layer formation rate is given as mm mg sediment load and therefore not related to time which means that although at higher sediment concentration the cake layer formation is faster the relative contribution of passing suspended sediments to cake layer formation is smaller except for clay the cake layer formation rate as a function of the streambed particle size is presented in fig 4b a higher cake formation rate for the same streambed column configuration streambed d 50 0 61 mm columns d 50 0 61 mm than for the different streambed column configuration streambed d 50 0 61 mm columns d 50 1 36 mm was observed for the large streambed particle size d 50 1 36 mm no cake layer was formed for the low sediment concentration of 1 g l for the fine streambed particle size d 50 0 61 mm a higher cake layer formation velocity occurred at the low sediment concentration 3 1 2 deep bed clogging turbidity measurements were done over the column height as indicator for assessing deep bed clogging the values shown in fig 5 correspond to the average of samples withdrawn each 3 4 h during the run of each experiment the water containing clay particles 0 5 10 μm presented the lowest turbidity measurements over the column heights for both sediment concentrations for the silt size particles 3 40 μm at the higher sediment concentration 6 g l the turbidity increased as the travel distance increased the turbidity for both sediment concentrations and both streambed particle sizes over the column height is illustrated in fig 5 for the larger streambed particle size d 50 1 36 mm the turbidity was stable over the height of the column with an average of 6 3 ntu and 31 9 ntu for 1 and 6 g l respectively for both sediment concentrations higher turbidity values were observed in the top 35 cm of the column with the smaller streambed particle size d 50 0 61 mm than with the larger streambed particle size d 50 1 36 mm in fig 6 the permeability k changes per each segment of the columns are shown as relative permeabilities k between ports divided by the clean bed permeability k o as a function of the injected sediment load as observed in fig 6 the higher permeability reduction occurred in the first 15 cm top layer for all the suspended sediment sizes tested which is linked to cake clogging this happened faster at the lower suspended sediments concentration deep bed clogging represented by the permeability reduction in the lower segments was evidenced for all sediment sizes being higher as the particle size decreased clay silt fine sand for fine sand the top layer was not clogged nor deep bed clogging was observed at the higher suspended sediment concentration fig 6c the mixture of suspended sediments presented the highest and fastest cake clogging occurrence and the lowest deep bed clogging except for fine sand 3 2 infiltration velocity during clogging fig 7 presents the variations in the infiltration velocity for different turbid solutions in relation to the infiltrated sediment mass q q o q s e d t in m d mg this infiltration velocity decline was higher for a sediment concentration of 1 g l compared to 6 g l apart for clay this is in line with the faster development of cake layer at 1 g l velocity expressed per sediment load it must be taken into account that the analysis was realized using suspended sediment load instead of time to make them comparable for fine sand no reduction of the infiltration velocity occurred at 6 g l whilst a slight reduction was observed for 1 g l in fig 7b the changes in infiltration velocities are compared for two streambed particle sizes d 50 1 36 mm and d 50 0 61 mm where the column particle size was the same for both d 50 1 36 mm the mixture of suspended sediments was used for this experiment higher infiltration velocity decline per weight of sediment load was observed at the lower sediment concentration when comparing the infiltration velocity decline for mixed sediments in the same particle sizes for both column and streambed d 50 0 61 mm versus different particle sizes streambed d 50 0 61 mm columns d 50 1 36 mm a much larger infiltration velocity decline was obtained for the different particle sizes 3 3 cake layer scouring the removal of the cake layer by scouring forces was registered during the assessment of three shields parameters θ 0 5θ c θ c and 2θ c compared to no flow with τ c 0 and subsequently θ 0 the shear velocities were of 0 017 0 029 and 0 041 m s respectively the tests were conducted for the medium sand streambed d 50 0 61 mm fig 8 illustrates the cake layer removal as a function of streambed velocities for the cake layers composed of different suspended sediments for the experiments conducted with clay particles 0 5 10 μm a relatively high removal 32 46 of the cake layer was observed at θ 0 5θ c however little additional cake layer was being removed at θ 1 and no extra removal was observed at θ 2θ c at the higher sediment concentration a much thicker cake layer was formed which also resulted in a thicker remaining clay layer after scouring 8 mm compared to clay the cake layer made of silt 3 40 μm was consistently harder to remove though at each increased shear stress a fraction of the layer was removed most silt particles from the removed cake layer were re suspended in the water but it was also observed that silt particles were partly re settled in the subsequent zone c fig 2 the re settlement suggests a potential clogging effect downstream the evaluated zone at the same time the newly cleaned streambed may become clogged with material scoured upstream for the fine sand cake layer 63 180 μm most of the deposited sediments were easily removed at the lower streambed velocity as observed in fig 8 although the fine sand sediments were moved from their initial position the formation of ripples and dunes were observed in zone c as a consequence scouring of the original streambed was also onset d 50 0 61 mm the cake layer formed by the mixture of sediments presented the highest resistance to erosion of all the suspended sediments assessed with only 23 31 of the cake layer being removed 3 4 infiltration velocity after scouring fig 9 compares the recovery of the infiltration velocity during the self cleansing experiments relative infiltration velocities as a function of the initial infiltration velocity q q 0 i e at clean bed conditions are shown the results for θ c 0 correspond to the infiltration velocity of the clogged streambed before starting the self cleansing experiments in none of the experiments independent of suspended sediment type or concentration the infiltration velocity recovered to its initial capacity regardless of the bed shear stress applied although the remainder of the cake layer after bed scouring was the thickest for the mixed suspended sediments fig 8 comparable to the clay layer the flow velocity recovery was the highest 84 96 for the mixed suspended sediments at both concentrations compared to the uniform suspended sediment sizes fig 9a during the clogging experiments with the mixed suspended sediments cake layer cracks were observed for the lower suspended sediments concentration the recovery was higher even if the infiltration velocity reduction during the clogging experiment was high fig 7 though the cake layer of the largest uniform suspended sediment sizes fine sand 63 180 μm was completely removed for both concentrations no recovery of the infiltration velocity was obtained as observed in fig 9b no differences in the infiltration recovery existed between both streambed sizes at the lower concentration on the other hand a higher infiltration capacity occurred for the smaller streambed size d 50 0 61 mm at the higher suspended sediment concentration which may be explained by movement of the original streambed as cracking of the cake layer was observed 4 discussion 4 1 cake clogging or deep bed clogging when comparing the different types of suspended sediments deep bed clogging was observed most predominantly for the experiments with silt the low cake formation velocity and the high infiltration velocity decline for silt particles at the higher suspended sediments concentration is linked to the non cohesive nature of the silt winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 where the weakness of physicochemical processes limits the attachment of silt particles to each other and onto the sand particles therefore the entrapped particles can be easily remobilized by the water flow reaching lower layers leading to deep bed clogging the clay particles were found to be mostly retained in the cake layer which may then be explained by the cohesiveness of clay particles krishnappan 2007 the cohesive nature of clay leads to particles aggregation of clay sediments floc formation particularly at high concentrations klassen et al 2013 therefore although both turbidity values tested during this research were high 1 g l and 6 g l the findings show that the 1 g l suspended solids led to higher cake layer formation velocities for non cohesive particles while 6 g l suspended solids concentration was favorable for higher cake layer formation velocities in cohesive particles having the opposite effect on the formation of deep bed clogging the suspended sediments mixture pinpoints the effect of the interparticle forces acting among the sediments e g van der waals and the interaction between them and the bed particles leading to larger particles with the ability to be retained on the top layer cake filtration due to the clay content also the interaction amongst different suspended particles onsets new clogging mechanisms e g 1 entrapment and sedimentation of fine sand sediments in small voids 2 entrapment of silt particles in existing voids and new voids because of the trapped fine sand and 3 straining hydrodynamic bridging and interparticle forces of clay and the retained suspended sediments veličković 2005 when reviewing the cake layer and deep bed turbidity measurements figs 4 and 5 the fine sand behaved very similar to the mixed sediments nevertheless the low infiltration velocity reduction for the fine sand experiments reveals that although the cake layer may have had the same thickness it was more permeable than is the case for mixed sediments different clogging mechanisms influence the infiltration capacity reduction in relation to the streambed size the smaller voids due to the smaller bed particle size are likely to retain more suspended sediment particles by entrapment winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 in this case mixed bed clogging occurs where cake clogging plays the most important role in the precluding of the water passage through the media as reported for slow sand filtration grace et al 2016 on the other hand deep bed clogging is the dominant mechanism for the large streambed size the larger voids have a larger storage capacity for particles and then enhance the mobility of particles into the media before clogging veličković 2005 favoring deep bed clogging occurrence this behavior has been widely reported for rapid sand filtration where suspended and colloidal particles are depth filtered ripperger et al 2012 the presence of larger voids can enhance the mobility of fine particles because of the higher flow velocities leading to higher hydrodynamic forces and to the weaker interparticle bonding forces jacobsen et al 1997 reddi et al 2000 the weak support exerted by the filling material of the columns which being larger than the particles of the streambed was not able to retain the particles previously entrapped and due to the changes in flow velocities between the transition from d 50 0 61 mm streambed to d 50 1 36 mm column contributed to sudden releases of particles 4 2 self cleansing of cake layer as stated by various researchers bed scouring depends on streambed particle size caldwell 2006 stuyfzand et al 2006 the suspended particle type has demonstrated to be the most important variable governing the self cleansing of the streambed for an uncovered clean streambed e g absence of plants biofilm the initial high removal velocity found with the cake layer made of clay may be referred as entrainment and or floc erosion the absence of additional removal may be related to the interaction strength between the sandy bed and the mud clay layer due to the cohesive and adhesive characteristics of the clay leading to a much higher erosion threshold jacobs et al 2011 however it must be noted that a recirculating flume was used during the experiments thus the resuspended clay conveyed to a turbidity current which could have affected the cake layer erodibility by the so called hindered erosion winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 the much thicker cake layer formation obtained at the higher suspended sediments concentration highly impacted the initial scouring of the clay cake this is related to the lower cake layer compression on the top layer and therefore a weaker strength to erosion mahdi and holdich 2013 mays and hunt 2005 the non cohesive nature of silt leads to a weak interaction between the bed and the cake layer which is favorable for the erodibility of the cake formation the ripples and dunes formations that occurred for the fine sand cake layer induced mass erosion of both the cake layer and the bed due to the wave induced shear stress winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 the continuous removal but the high resistance to erosion of the cake layer made of the mixture of fine sediments is explained by the strong interparticle forces among the suspended sediments avoiding a high resuspension velocity as observed when sediments were tested individually our findings indicate an important interaction between the streambed and the suspended sediment size the smaller the bed particle size the higher the interaction strength this behavior is related to the stronger physicochemical forces from small particle sizes acting to preserve the particles joined the infiltration velocity never recovered to its initial capacity regardless of the bed shear stress assessed an overview of cake layer removal and infiltration velocity recovery per sediment type is presented in table 2 for the homogeneous suspended sediments clay silt fine sand the infiltration velocity did not show any increase even if the cake layers were partly removed for the mixed suspended sediments 5 clay 80 silt and 15 fine sand cake layer cracks during the clogging experiments were observed therefore uneven erosion patterns occurred during scouring experiments caused by the presence of the existing cake cracks increasing the longitudinal cracks extent on cake layer formation jacobs et al 2011 even if a high mobilization of the mixture cake layer during the scouring experiments occurred fig 8 the immediate infiltration velocity recovery is therefore probably associated with preferential flows caused by the ameliorated cake cracking on the surface the entrapment of particles in the deeper voids can be considered deep bed clogging and consequently there is a reduced chance of natural recovery of infiltration capacity because of the scouring of these particles compared to cake clogging goldschneider et al 2007 in smaller streambed particle sizes the clogging particles cannot penetrate as deeply and cake clogging occurs brunke 1999 veličković 2005 it was found that the sediment concentration affected the occurrence of cake and or deep bed clogging depending on the type of sediment which in turn influenced the infiltration recovery thus for clay particles the higher concentration favored the cake layer formation limiting the deep bed clogging while for silt fine sand and the mixture of sediments the higher sediment concentration the lower the cake layer formation velocity leading to higher deep bed clogging the concentration did not show an evident effect on the self cleansing of the cake layer on sediments other than clay which suggests that the infiltration recovery was merely a function of deep bed clogging 5 conclusions based on the presented research it may be concluded that during simulated riverbank filtration high recovery of the infiltration velocity 84 96 at low shear stresses was possible for high turbidity water with a mixture of different sediments as found in natural water bodies clay and silt behaved very differently due to the difference in cohesiveness clay was found to produce a persistent sticky cake layer whereas silt penetrated deeper into the bed both resulting in an absence of infiltration velocity recovery the cake layer of fine sand sediments was easiest to remove resulting in dune formation on the streambed nevertheless due to deep bed clogging by the sand particles in the coarser streambed the infiltration velocity did not recover the interaction between the mixed suspended sediments 5 clay 80 silt and 15 fine sand resulted in uneven erosion patterns during scouring of the streambed allowing for the infiltration velocity to recover to 84 96 altogether it may be concluded that natural recovery of infiltration capacity during river bank filtration of highly turbid waters is expected to occur as long as the river carries a mixture of suspended sediments the fine streambed formation avoids the occurrence of deep bed clogging which increases the chances of being self cleaned acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the support of colciencias for

be bio degraded with the formation of carcinogenic inorganic arsenic as species here ferrate oxidation of rox was reported in which we studied total as removal determined reaction kinetics identified oxidation products and proposed a reaction mechanism it was found that the apparent second order rate constant kapp of ferrate with rox was 305 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 25 c and over 95 of total as was removed within 10 min when ferrate rox molar ratio was 20 1 species specific rate constants analysis showed that hfeo4 was the dominant species reacting with rox ferrate initially attacked asc bond of rox and resulted in the formation of arsenate and 2 nitrohydroquinone the arsenate was simultaneously removed by ferric nanoparticles formed in the reduction of ferrate while 2 nitrohydroquinone was further oxidized into nitro 1 4 benzoquinone these results suggest that ferrate treatment can be an effective method for the control of rox in water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords

and huang 2012 have shown great results for rox removal however organoarsenic compounds are difficult to be removed through adsorption process as compared with inorganic arsenic and the time to achieve desired adsorption equilibrium is normally more than 5 h considering that rox mainly existing at ppb to ppm level in environmental samples garbarino et al 2003 long adsorption time would lead to the application of large amount of adsorbent and prolonging hydraulic retention time rox can be oxidized by heat activated persulfate and the rox removal efficiency increased from 11 to 98 as the

as phenols organosulfur compounds nitrogen containing compounds and pharmaceuticals graham et al 2004 sharma et al 2001 yang et al 2012 meanwhile in situ formed ferric nanoparticles generated in the ferrate reduction process have a great potential to remove hazardous ions such as as iii lee et al 2003a prucek et al 2013 from water since rox contains electron rich moieties and the released as species may be simultaneously removed by the ferrate resultant ferric nanoparticles the effectiveness of ferrate treatment on rox removal and total as control aroused our interest herein the oxidation

version 1 6 ab sciex and processed using peakview software version 1 2 ab sciex 3 results and discussion 3 1 effectiveness of ferrate on rox and total as removal effectiveness of ferrate on rox oxidation was initially explored fig 1 when 5 μm of rox reacted with 50 μm of ferrate at ph 7 0 more than 92 of rox was removed by ferrate within 5 min when the initial ferrate rox molar ratio increased to 20 almost complete removal of rox was achieved within 40 s the hplc detection limit of rox was 0 02 μm according to published results the reaction time is normally above 30 min for effective removal c c0 90 of rox with chemical oxidants or adsorbents acuña et al 2017 ji et al 2016 tian et al 2017 this suggests that ferrate is highly effective for the oxidation of rox inorganic as species may be released during the transformation of rox and they are more toxic and mobile than rox han et al 2017 in the reaction with rox the effect of ferrate on total as removal was investigated fig 1c when 50 μm and 100 μm of ferrate reacted with 5 μm of rox at ph 7 0 over 90 and 95 of the total as were removed within 30 min respectively when the ferrate rox molar ratio increased to 30 over 99 of total as were removed within 5 min and the amount of total as was below 10 μg l which satisfies the world health organization standard on the amount of as below 10 μg l in drinking water 3 2 reaction kinetics second order reaction rate law eq 1 was used to study the reaction process the reaction rate constants k app were calculated based on natural logarithm of rox concentrations and the relevant ferrate exposure 0 t ferrate dt values fig 2 a the k app values were 747 m 1s 1 306 m 1s 1 and 111 m 1s 1 at ph 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 respectively and were 27 m 1s 1 to 1 m 1s 1 from ph 8 0 to ph 10 this suggests that the reaction was ph dependent and ferrate was highly reactive with rox under slightly acidic and neutral ph conditions chemically the redox potential of ferrate is higher under acidic conditions than under basic conditions hence acidic condition is in favor for the oxidation of rox with ferrate besides joshi et al reported that for the removal of aromatic organoarsenic compounds with metal oxides the removal process was strongly ph dependent joshi et al 2017a 2017b low ph condition would make the adsorbents positively charged and increase the coulombic electrostatic forces between adsorbents and aromatic organoarsenic compounds this mechanism may also facilitate the removal of rox with the ferrate resultant particles to further explore reaction mechanism the measured rate constants k app were compared with species specific reaction model fitting eq 3 and eq 4 results as shown in fig 2b after model fitting k11 1 81 0 02 103 m 1s 1 k12 1 79 0 11 102 m 1s 1 k13 k21 k22 k23 0 and the model result is well fitted with measured reaction rate constants r2 0 9997 this indicates that i in the reaction of rox with ferrate contribution of feo4 2 on rox oxidation is negligible k21 k22 k23 0 ii hfeo4 is the dominant ferrate specie reacting with rox iii k11 is 10 times higher than k12 which suggests that the reaction between hfeo4 and deprotonated rox controlled the overall reaction of rox with ferrate from ph 6 5 to ph 10 3 3 the conversion of as species in the degradation of organoarsenicals the released inorganic arsenic is more toxic and mobile than its parent form conversion of as species in the reaction process was investigated fig 3 a shows the variation of rox total as as iii and as v in the reaction process hydroxylamine hydrochloride 1 mm and hcl v t 0 5 were added to dissolve settled ferric floc the average concentration of total as was around 5 μm during the experiment this suggests that the total as was mass balanced accordingly the content of rox decreased while the content of as v increased as a function of reaction time in the conversion of organoarsenicals aso oh 2 group would be cleaved from aromatic ring leading to the formation of aso3 3 czaplicka et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 in the reaction of rox with ferrate we only observed traces of as iii in lc icp ms spectrum fig 3b in initial reaction stage 0 2 min and the determined average amount of as iii was 0 04 μm during the whole experiment these data suggest that the aso oh 2 group was cleaved from rox and may be further oxidized into as v since toxicity and mobility of as iii were higher than that of as v the conversion of rox into as v was in favor for eliminating the toxicity of rox meanwhile the total as in the system could be effectively removed by ferrate fig 1c the ferric nanoparticles formed in ferrate reduction have great potential on hazardous ion removal inorganic as iii could be oxidized to as v by ferrate and subsequently removed by ferric coagulation lee et al 2003b since the aso oh 2 group could be cleaved from rox molecular and transformed into as v the in situ formed ferric nanoparticles may further adsorb as v sem edx and xps analysis were employed to analyze the settled solids the distribution of as in ferric particles is shown in fig 4 generally the settled solids are a mixture of fe cl c k si and as the k cl c and si found in the settled solids may come from the buffer solution while the fe and as originated from ferrate and rox respectively xps analysis showed the chemical state of as in rox samples before and after reaction with ferrate fig 4c and d binding energy be of fitting peak in rox sample was 44 4 ev which could be assigned to as iii 44 3 44 5 ev in comparison the be of fitting peak in solution settled solids ferric particles was 45 3 ev which can be ascribed to as v 45 2 45 6 ev chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2007 these data suggested that following the reaction between rox and ferrate aso oh 2 on rox was oxidized to as v by ferrate as v then reacted with in situ formed ferric nanoparticles prucek et al 2013 and was removed by the ferrate resultant nanoparticles through particle aggregation and sedimentation 3 4 effect of solution ph on total as removal above results show that alkaline condition would negatively affect the oxidation of rox by ferrate since arsenate would be formed in the rox oxidation process the effect of solution ph on total as removal was investigated fig 5 a shows the change of the total as removal ratio in the rox oxidation process under different ph conditions over 99 of the total as was removed at ph 6 0 and the removal efficiency was relatively unchanged during the entire reaction process 120 min meanwhile the concentration of fe in solution was decreased from 2 8 mg l to 0 08 mg l within 1 min at ph 6 0 fig 5b these data suggest that ferrate has a strong reactivity with rox and can effectively remove the released inorganic arsenic through fe iii formation under slightly acidic condition ph 6 0 when the solution ph increased to 7 0 53 of the total as were removed within 5 min and over 90 of the total as were removed within 30 min after that the total as removal efficiency remained around 91 however when the solution ph increased to 8 5 and 9 5 the total as removal efficiencies were below 7 in both groups alkaline conditions would enhance the stability of ferrate and the concentration of dissolved fe was above 2 3 mg l throughout the reaction in the groups this indicates that less than 18 of ferrate was transformed into particles through the experiment since the ferrate resultant nanoparticles were critical for the removal of the inorganic as species high level of ferrate stability would impact the removal of the total as in the reaction solution ph not only affects the stability of ferrate but also influences the surface charge of relevant particles for the ferric nanoparticles formed in ferrate reduction process their zero potential point was 6 8 liu et al 2017 the ferrate resultant particles were negatively charged under alkaline condition this can impact the particle aggregation behavior and affect the removal of total as besides the organoarsenicals and inorganic arsenics were negatively charged under ph 6 0 10 0 sun et al 2017 the electrostatic repulsion between ferric nanoparticles and as species may also impact the removal of as with ferrate 3 5 oxidation products and reaction pathway in above sections we showed that rox could be effectively oxidized by ferrate and that the released inorganic as species could be eliminated by ferrate resultant particles however transformation of aromatic ring part of rox is ambiguous hplc esi qtof ms was employed to analyze the oxidation products of rox by comparing tic chromatograms before and after the reaction of rox with ferrate chromatographic peak of rox appearing at 27 8 min was initially identified fig 6 a and 6b the intensity of rox chromatographic peak largely decreased after 2 min of reaction this is in accordance with above data that ferrate is effective for the oxidation of rox besides rox several new peaks appear in the tic chromatogram after 2 min of reaction three possible oxidation products were obtained from the hplc esi qtof ms results the m z of product 1 is 154 95 da fig 6c after analyzing the possible degradation pathway of rox we speculate that product 1 was 2 nitrohydroquinone in the reaction of ferrate with rox ferrate initially attracts the asc bond of rox oxygen atoms were transferred from ferrate to rox leading to the oxidation of aso oh 2 group into arsenic acid fig 4 in this process the aromatic ring in rox was oxidized by ferrate and transformed into 2 nitrohydroquinone fig 7 besides product 1 product 2 m z 152 03 also showed intense signal in the tic chromatograms after analyzing the ionization pattern of product 2 we speculate it may be nitro 1 4 benzoquinone a transformation product of 2 nitrohydroquinone fig 7 chemically the nitro 1 4 benzoquinone is difficult to ionize however some double bonds are reduced in the electrospray ionization process leading to the formation of the ionized product the arsenic ion further reacted with ferrate and would be removed by ferrate resultant nanoparticles as discussed in previous sections on the other hand 2 nitrohydroquinone and nitro 1 4 benzoquinone may be further oxidized by ferrate leading to the formation of product 3 m z 96 96 fig 6d we noticed that this product also appeared in the mass spectrum of rox we speculated that it is phenol but the molecular weight of phenol is 94 11 fig 6e product 3 may be a ring cleavage product of nitro 1 4 benzoquinone fig 7 the variations of relative intensity of rox and the products identified during oxidation are recorded fig 8 in accordance with the proposed mechanism the intensity of product 1 increased with the decrease of rox at the beginning of reaction this indicates that product 1 may be a primary oxidation product formed at the initial stage of the ferrate oxidation of rox after one minute the intensity of product 1 decreased as that of product 2 increased at the same time this suggests product 1 was further oxidized after two minutes the intensity of product 2 decreased while that of product 3 increased significantly such change is in accordance with the proposed mechanism fig 8 where rox and successive oxidation products are oxidized by ferrate resulting in ring cleavage products in the system 3 6 aggregation of ferric particles and desorption of as from settled floc for the removal of hazardous ions with adsorbent environmental factors such as water temperature background ions and solution ph would affect the interaction between target pollutants and adsorbent thus lead to the desorption of captured hazardous ions ferrate resultant particles adsorbed as species releasing from rox background constituents would competitively combine with ferric particles and influence their chemical properties and this may make the captured as species desorbed desorption of captured as species would greatly impact the water quality hence the aggregation behavior of as bearing ferric particles and the desorption of as species from ferric floc were investigated the average hydrodynamic diameter of the ferric particles was around 170 nm and this average diameter surpassed 1 μm within 40 min under static condition fig 9 a after 2 h the average diameter surpassed 1 5 μm these data showed that the hydrodynamic size of ferrate resultant particles would increase from nanoscale to micrometer scale within an hour when coagulant was added and the solution was vigorously stirred the ferric particles are swiftly expanding and captured by coagulant the rapid expansion of particle size would facilitate the separation of as bearing ferric particles in relevant treatment procedures effects of background ions na mg2 ca2 cl and no3 and decreasing solution ph from ph 7 0 to 5 0 on the desorption of as were not remarkable while increase in solution temperature and ph noticeably led to the desorption of as fig 9b the as v formed in rox degradation process was removed by ferrate resultant particles the combination of as species and ferric particles can resist the negative effects of background ions on the desorption of as in comparison elevating solution temperature would increase the energy of the system attenuate the interaction of as and ferric particles and thus lead to the desorption of adsorbed as when solution ph decreased from 7 0 to 5 0 no as desorption was observed in comparison when solution ph increased to 9 0 the level of desorbed as surpassed 70 μg l much higher than the who regulated as contained 10 μg l in drinking water as species mainly exist as anion of aso4 3 and aso3 3 in water and the isoelectric point phpzc of ferrate resultant particles were 6 8 the electrostatic attraction between anion and positively charged particles is in favor for the removal of as species with ferric floc at circumneutral ph however when solution ph increased to 9 0 the oh competed with adsorbed as species for the interaction with ferric particles and this process led to desorption of captured as hence for the removal of rox in authentic polluted waters monitoring the variation in solution ph and temperature and regularly removing settled floc can prevent desorption of as 3 7 oxidation of rox and total as removal in authentic waters background constituents existing in authentic waters would affect aggregation behavior and physical properties of nanoparticle liu et al 2018 and may influence the removal of as ferrate oxidation of rox in authentic waters was investigated fig 10 a shows the concentration changes of rox when reacting with ferrate in river water ground water and wwtp effluent ferrate rox molar ratio is 20 1 rox was removed within 2 min in ground water and 3 min in river water respectively in comparison merely 85 of rox was removed in wwtp effluent after 20 min of reaction compared with that in river water and ground water the removal of rox in wwtp effluent was largely affected according to the characteristics of water samples the content of organic substance toc ca2 na cl so4 2 and po4 3 in wwtp effluent is 0 5 8 times higher than that in river water and ground water table 1 organic constituents in authentic waters may competitively consume ferrate and decrease the oxidation of rox in the system co existing species such as ca2 na cl so4 2 and po4 3 also influence the activity of ferrate wang et al 2018 and thus obstruct the removal of rox however compared with published methods on rox control ferrate oxidation is effective for removal of rox under circumneutral ph conditions acuña et al 2017 chen and huang 2012 ji et al 2016 although the rox oxidation ratio was affected total as removal ratios in three groups surpassed 86 within half an hour fig 10b the removal of as species could be attributed to the function of ferric particles although background constituents affected oxidation behavior of ferrate the adsorption ability of ferrate resultant ferric particles towards as species was not greatly affected ferrate is highly effective to remove total as for the treatment of rox in authentic waters 4 conclusions this work explored the oxidation of rox with ferrate and examined the transformation of as species in reaction process following conclusions are drawn 1 ferrate can rapidly oxidize rox under neutral ph condition at ph 7 0 the reaction rate constant of ferrate with rox was 305 m 1s 1 the apparent second order rate constants of ferrate with rox ranged from 747 to 1 m 1s 1 when solution ph increased from 6 5 to 10 2 the total as in the system could be effectively removed after ferrate treatment when initial ferrate rox molar ratio was 20 over 95 of total as would be removed within 10 min under ph 7 0 when the molar ratio increased to 30 96 of total as would be removed within 1 min 3 as c bond would be attacked by ferrate leading to the cleavage of aso oh 2 group the aso oh 2 group would be oxidized into as v and subsequently removed by in situ formed ferric nanoparticles 4 the aromatic ring part of rox would be oxidized by ferrate leading to the formation of 2 nitrohydroquinone and nitro 1 4 benzoquinone these products may be further oxidized into ring cleavage product or reduction product of phenol 5 ferrate could effectively oxidize rox and remove total as in authentic waters acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national key r d program of china 2017yfa0207203 the national natural science foundation of china grant

19253,roxarsone rox is used in breeding industry to prevent infection by parasites stimulate livestock growth and improve pigmentation of livestock meat after being released into environment rox could be bio degraded with the formation of carcinogenic inorganic arsenic as species here ferrate oxidation of rox was reported in which we studied total as removal determined reaction kinetics identified oxidation products and proposed a reaction mechanism it was found that the apparent second order rate constant kapp of ferrate with rox was 305 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 25 c and over 95 of total as was removed within 10 min when ferrate rox molar ratio was 20 1 species specific rate constants analysis showed that hfeo4 was the dominant species reacting with rox ferrate initially attacked asc bond of rox and resulted in the formation of arsenate and 2 nitrohydroquinone the arsenate was simultaneously removed by ferric nanoparticles formed in the reduction of ferrate while 2 nitrohydroquinone was further oxidized into nitro 1 4 benzoquinone these results suggest that ferrate treatment can be an effective method for the control of rox in water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords

livestock and large amount of consumed rox is excreted in original form through animal feces liu et al 2015 stolz et al 2007 although rox is not highly toxic to humans it could be transformed via biotic and abiotic pathways in the environment han et al 2017 and release carcinogenic inorganic arsenic as species hu et al 2017 studies estimated that every year thousands of tons of rox are consumed worldwide guo et al 2013 extensive use wide distribution and potential toxicity have rendered rox a severe threat to the ecosystem and human health different treatment methods such as physical adsorption chen and huang 2012 joshi et al 2017b li et al 2016 tian et al 2017 advanced oxidation hu et al 2015 ji et al 2016 and photodegradation adak et al 2015 bednar et al 2003 xie et al

and huang 2012 have shown great results for rox removal however organoarsenic compounds are difficult to be removed through adsorption process as compared with inorganic arsenic and the time to achieve desired adsorption equilibrium is normally more than 5 h considering that rox mainly existing at ppb to ppm level in environmental samples garbarino et al 2003 long adsorption time would lead to the application of large amount of adsorbent and prolonging hydraulic retention time rox can be oxidized by heat activated persulfate and the rox removal efficiency increased from 11 to 98 as the temperature increased from 40 to 70 c in the reaction time of 8 h ji et al 2016 hu et al reported that fenton enhanced plasma system could oxidize rox hu et al 2015 yet the reaction is highly ph

odor compounds he et al 2009 liu et al 2018a heavy metals jiang 2007 lee et al 2003a and aquatic microbes fan et al 2018 as a strong oxidant ferrate tends to attack electron rich organic moieties such as phenols organosulfur compounds nitrogen containing compounds and pharmaceuticals graham et al 2004 sharma et al 2001 yang et al 2012 meanwhile in situ formed ferric nanoparticles generated in the ferrate reduction process have a great potential to remove hazardous ions such as as iii lee et al 2003a prucek et al 2013 from water since rox contains electron rich moieties and the released as species may be simultaneously removed by the ferrate resultant ferric nanoparticles the effectiveness of ferrate treatment on rox removal and total as control aroused our interest herein the oxidation kinetics and reaction mechanism of rox with ferrate was investigated reaction kinetics were examined in buffered waters at ph 6 5 to ph 10 and species specific reactions between ferrate species and rox species were analyzed transformation of as species during the oxidation process was examined and removal of total as was determined to fully understand reaction mechanism liquid chromatography

version 1 6 ab sciex and processed using peakview software version 1 2 ab sciex 3 results and discussion 3 1 effectiveness of ferrate on rox and total as removal effectiveness of ferrate on rox oxidation was initially explored fig 1 when 5 μm of rox reacted with 50 μm of ferrate at ph 7 0 more than 92 of rox was removed by ferrate within 5 min when the initial ferrate rox molar ratio increased to 20 almost complete removal of rox was achieved within 40 s the hplc detection limit of rox was 0 02 μm according to published results the reaction time is normally above 30 min for effective removal c c0 90 of rox with chemical oxidants or adsorbents acuña et al 2017 ji et al 2016 tian et al 2017 this suggests that ferrate is highly effective for the oxidation of rox inorganic as species may be released during the transformation of rox and they are more toxic and mobile than rox han et al 2017 in the reaction with rox the effect of ferrate on total as removal was investigated fig 1c when 50 μm and 100 μm of ferrate reacted with 5 μm of rox at ph 7 0 over 90 and 95 of the total as were removed within 30 min respectively when the ferrate rox molar ratio increased to 30 over 99 of total as were removed within 5 min and the amount of total as was below 10 μg l which satisfies the world health organization standard on the amount of as below 10 μg l in drinking water 3 2 reaction kinetics second order reaction rate law eq 1 was used to study the reaction process the reaction rate constants k app were calculated based on natural logarithm of rox concentrations and the relevant ferrate exposure 0 t ferrate dt values fig 2 a the k app values were 747 m 1s 1 306 m 1s 1 and 111 m 1s 1 at ph 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 respectively and were 27 m 1s 1 to 1 m 1s 1 from ph 8 0 to ph 10 this suggests that the reaction was ph dependent and ferrate was highly reactive with rox under slightly acidic and neutral ph conditions chemically the redox potential of ferrate is higher under acidic conditions than under basic conditions hence acidic condition is in favor for the oxidation of rox with ferrate besides joshi et al reported that for the removal of aromatic organoarsenic compounds with metal oxides the removal process was strongly ph dependent joshi et al 2017a 2017b low ph condition would make the adsorbents positively charged and increase the coulombic electrostatic forces between adsorbents and aromatic organoarsenic compounds this mechanism may also facilitate the removal of rox with the ferrate resultant particles to further explore reaction mechanism the measured rate constants k app were compared with species specific reaction model fitting eq 3 and eq 4 results as shown in fig 2b after model fitting k11 1 81 0 02 103 m 1s 1 k12 1 79 0 11 102 m 1s 1 k13 k21 k22 k23 0 and the model result is well fitted with measured reaction rate constants r2 0 9997 this indicates that i in the reaction of rox with ferrate contribution of feo4 2 on rox oxidation is negligible k21 k22 k23 0 ii hfeo4 is the dominant ferrate specie reacting with rox iii k11 is 10 times higher than k12 which suggests that the reaction between hfeo4 and deprotonated rox controlled the overall reaction of rox with ferrate from ph 6 5 to ph 10 3 3 the conversion of as species in the degradation of organoarsenicals the released inorganic arsenic is more toxic and mobile than its parent form conversion of as species in the reaction process was investigated fig 3 a shows the variation of rox total as as iii and as v in the reaction process hydroxylamine hydrochloride 1 mm and hcl v t 0 5 were added to dissolve settled ferric floc the average concentration of total as was around 5 μm during the experiment this suggests that the total as was mass balanced accordingly the content of rox decreased while the content of as v increased as a function of reaction time in the conversion of organoarsenicals aso oh 2 group would be cleaved from aromatic ring leading to the formation of aso3 3 czaplicka et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 in the reaction of rox with ferrate we only observed traces of as iii in lc icp ms spectrum fig 3b in initial reaction stage 0 2 min and the determined average amount of as iii was 0 04 μm during the whole experiment these data suggest that the aso oh 2 group was cleaved from rox and may be further oxidized into as v since toxicity and mobility of as iii were higher than that of as v the conversion of rox into as v was in favor for eliminating the toxicity of rox meanwhile the total as in the system could be effectively removed by ferrate fig 1c the ferric nanoparticles formed in ferrate reduction have great potential on hazardous ion removal inorganic as iii could be oxidized to as v by ferrate and subsequently removed by ferric coagulation lee et al 2003b since the aso oh 2 group could be cleaved from rox molecular and transformed into as v the in situ formed ferric nanoparticles may further adsorb as v sem edx and xps analysis were employed to analyze the settled solids the distribution of as in ferric particles is shown in fig 4 generally the settled solids are a mixture of fe cl c k si and as the k cl c and si found in the settled solids may come from the buffer solution while the fe and as originated from ferrate and rox respectively xps analysis showed the chemical state of as in rox samples before and after reaction with ferrate fig 4c and d binding energy be of fitting peak in rox sample was 44 4 ev which could be assigned to as iii 44 3 44 5 ev in comparison the be of fitting peak in solution settled solids ferric particles was 45 3 ev which can be ascribed to as v 45 2 45 6 ev chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2007 these data suggested that following the reaction between rox and ferrate aso oh 2 on rox was oxidized to as v by ferrate as v then reacted with in situ formed ferric nanoparticles prucek et al 2013 and was removed by the ferrate resultant nanoparticles through particle aggregation and sedimentation 3 4 effect of solution ph on total as removal above results show that alkaline condition would negatively affect the oxidation of rox by ferrate since arsenate would be formed in the rox oxidation process the effect of solution ph on total as removal was investigated fig 5 a shows the change of the total as removal ratio in the rox oxidation process under different ph conditions over 99 of the total as was removed at ph 6 0 and the removal efficiency was relatively unchanged during the entire reaction process 120 min meanwhile the concentration of fe in solution was decreased from 2 8 mg l to 0 08 mg l within 1 min at ph 6 0 fig 5b these data suggest that ferrate has a strong reactivity with rox and can effectively remove the released inorganic arsenic through fe iii formation under slightly acidic condition ph 6 0 when the solution ph increased to 7 0 53 of the total as were removed within 5 min and over 90 of the total as were removed within 30 min after that the total as removal efficiency remained around 91 however when the solution ph increased to 8 5 and 9 5 the total as removal efficiencies were below 7 in both groups alkaline conditions would enhance the stability of ferrate and the concentration of dissolved fe was above 2 3 mg l throughout the reaction in the groups this indicates that less than 18 of ferrate was transformed into particles through the experiment since the ferrate resultant nanoparticles were critical for the removal of the inorganic as species high level of ferrate stability would impact the removal of the total as in the reaction solution ph not only affects the stability of ferrate but also influences the surface charge of relevant particles for the ferric nanoparticles formed in ferrate reduction process their zero potential point was 6 8 liu et al 2017 the ferrate resultant particles were negatively charged under alkaline condition this can impact the particle aggregation behavior and affect the removal of total as besides the organoarsenicals and inorganic arsenics were negatively charged under ph 6 0 10 0 sun et al 2017 the electrostatic repulsion between ferric nanoparticles and as species may also impact the removal of as with ferrate 3 5 oxidation products and reaction pathway in above sections we showed that rox could be effectively oxidized by ferrate and that the released inorganic as species could be eliminated by ferrate resultant particles however transformation of aromatic ring part of rox is ambiguous hplc esi qtof ms was employed to analyze the oxidation products of rox by comparing tic chromatograms before and after the reaction of rox with ferrate chromatographic peak of rox appearing at 27 8 min was initially identified fig 6 a and 6b the intensity of rox chromatographic peak largely decreased after 2 min of reaction this is in accordance with above data that ferrate is effective for the oxidation of rox besides rox several new peaks appear in the tic chromatogram after 2 min of reaction three possible oxidation products were obtained from the hplc esi qtof ms results the m z of product 1 is 154 95 da fig 6c after analyzing the possible degradation pathway of rox we speculate that product 1 was 2 nitrohydroquinone in the reaction of ferrate with rox ferrate initially attracts the asc bond of rox oxygen atoms were transferred from ferrate to rox leading to the oxidation of aso oh 2 group into arsenic acid fig 4 in this process the aromatic ring in rox was oxidized by ferrate and transformed into 2 nitrohydroquinone fig 7 besides product 1 product 2 m z 152 03 also showed intense signal in the tic chromatograms after analyzing the ionization pattern of product 2 we speculate it may be nitro 1 4 benzoquinone a transformation product of 2 nitrohydroquinone fig 7 chemically the nitro 1 4 benzoquinone is difficult to ionize however some double bonds are reduced in the electrospray ionization process leading to the formation of the ionized product the arsenic ion further reacted with ferrate and would be removed by ferrate resultant nanoparticles as discussed in previous sections on the other hand 2 nitrohydroquinone and nitro 1 4 benzoquinone may be further oxidized by ferrate leading to the formation of product 3 m z 96 96 fig 6d we noticed that this product also appeared in the mass spectrum of rox we speculated that it is phenol but the molecular weight of phenol is 94 11 fig 6e product 3 may be a ring cleavage product of nitro 1 4 benzoquinone fig 7 the variations of relative intensity of rox and the products identified during oxidation are recorded fig 8 in accordance with the proposed mechanism the intensity of product 1 increased with the decrease of rox at the beginning of reaction this indicates that product 1 may be a primary oxidation product formed at the initial stage of the ferrate oxidation of rox after one minute the intensity of product 1 decreased as that of product 2 increased at the same time this suggests product 1 was further oxidized after two minutes the intensity of product 2 decreased while that of product 3 increased significantly such change is in accordance with the proposed mechanism fig 8 where rox and successive oxidation products are oxidized by ferrate resulting in ring cleavage products in the system 3 6 aggregation of ferric particles and desorption of as from settled floc for the removal of hazardous ions with adsorbent environmental factors such as water temperature background ions and solution ph would affect the interaction between target pollutants and adsorbent thus lead to the desorption of captured hazardous ions ferrate resultant particles adsorbed as species releasing from rox background constituents would competitively combine with ferric particles and influence their chemical properties and this may make the captured as species desorbed desorption of captured as species would greatly impact the water quality hence the aggregation behavior of as bearing ferric particles and the desorption of as species from ferric floc were investigated the average hydrodynamic diameter of the ferric particles was around 170 nm and this average diameter surpassed 1 μm within 40 min under static condition fig 9 a after 2 h the average diameter surpassed 1 5 μm these data showed that the hydrodynamic size of ferrate resultant particles would increase from nanoscale to micrometer scale within an hour when coagulant was added and the solution was vigorously stirred the ferric particles are swiftly expanding and captured by coagulant the rapid expansion of particle size would facilitate the separation of as bearing ferric particles in relevant treatment procedures effects of background ions na mg2 ca2 cl and no3 and decreasing solution ph from ph 7 0 to 5 0 on the desorption of as were not remarkable while increase in solution temperature and ph noticeably led to the desorption of as fig 9b the as v formed in rox degradation process was removed by ferrate resultant particles the combination of as species and ferric particles can resist the negative effects of background ions on the desorption of as in comparison elevating solution temperature would increase the energy of the system attenuate the interaction of as and ferric particles and thus lead to the desorption of adsorbed as when solution ph decreased from 7 0 to 5 0 no as desorption was observed in comparison when solution ph increased to 9 0 the level of desorbed as surpassed 70 μg l much higher than the who regulated as contained 10 μg l in drinking water as species mainly exist as anion of aso4 3 and aso3 3 in water and the isoelectric point phpzc of ferrate resultant particles were 6 8 the electrostatic attraction between anion and positively charged particles is in favor for the removal of as species with ferric floc at circumneutral ph however when solution ph increased to 9 0 the oh competed with adsorbed as species for the interaction with ferric particles and this process led to desorption of captured as hence for the removal of rox in authentic polluted waters monitoring the variation in solution ph and temperature and regularly removing settled floc can prevent desorption of as 3 7 oxidation of rox and total as removal in authentic waters background constituents existing in authentic waters would affect aggregation behavior and physical properties of nanoparticle liu et al 2018 and may influence the removal of as ferrate oxidation of rox in authentic waters was investigated fig 10 a shows the concentration changes of rox when reacting with ferrate in river water ground water and wwtp effluent ferrate rox molar ratio is 20 1 rox was removed within 2 min in ground water and 3 min in river water respectively in comparison merely 85 of rox was removed in wwtp effluent after 20 min of reaction compared with that in river water and ground water the removal of rox in wwtp effluent was largely affected according to the characteristics of water samples the content of organic substance toc ca2 na cl so4 2 and po4 3 in wwtp effluent is 0 5 8 times higher than that in river water and ground water table 1 organic constituents in authentic waters may competitively consume ferrate and decrease the oxidation of rox in the system co existing species such as ca2 na cl so4 2 and po4 3 also influence the activity of ferrate wang et al 2018 and thus obstruct the removal of rox however compared with published methods on rox control ferrate oxidation is effective for removal of rox under circumneutral ph conditions acuña et al 2017 chen and huang 2012 ji et al 2016 although the rox oxidation ratio was affected total as removal ratios in three groups surpassed 86 within half an hour fig 10b the removal of as species could be attributed to the function of ferric particles although background constituents affected oxidation behavior of ferrate the adsorption ability of ferrate resultant ferric particles towards as species was not greatly affected ferrate is highly effective to remove total as for the treatment of rox in authentic waters 4 conclusions this work explored the oxidation of rox with ferrate and examined the transformation of as species in reaction process following conclusions are drawn 1 ferrate can rapidly oxidize rox under neutral ph condition at ph 7 0 the reaction rate constant of ferrate with rox was 305 m 1s 1 the apparent second order rate constants of ferrate with rox ranged from 747 to 1 m 1s 1 when solution ph increased from 6 5 to 10 2 the total as in the system could be effectively removed after ferrate treatment when initial ferrate rox molar ratio was 20 over 95 of total as would be removed within 10 min under ph 7 0 when the molar ratio increased to 30 96 of total as would be removed within 1 min 3 as c bond would be attacked by ferrate leading to the cleavage of aso oh 2 group the aso oh 2 group would be oxidized into as v and subsequently removed by in situ formed ferric nanoparticles 4 the aromatic ring part of rox would be oxidized by ferrate leading to the formation of 2 nitrohydroquinone and nitro 1 4 benzoquinone these products may be further oxidized into ring cleavage product or reduction product of phenol 5 ferrate could effectively oxidize rox and remove total as in authentic waters acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national key r d program of china 2017yfa0207203 the national natural science foundation of china grant

19254,ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds have shown a potential to replace traditional ultraviolet uv pressure lamps for water disinfection however the research is not sufficient and hence it is still difficult to make any logical conclusions in this work uv leds with peak emissions at 267 275 310 nm and combined emissions at 267 275 267 310 and 275 310 nm were applied to a batch water disinfection system under either single or combined wavelength situation the inactivation efficiency reactivation due to photoreactivation and dark repair after uv irradiation and electrical energy consumption were evaluated by way of the model bacterium escherichia coli it was found that the 267 nm uv led had the highest inactivation efficiency than other uv leds although reactivation occurred after 267 275 267 275 and 275 310 nm uv leds irradiations it occurred to a lesser extent in dark repair than in photoreactivation demonstrating that photo effect is the dominant mechanism of reactivation in addition decay phase was more prominent than reactivation in dark repair however the irradiation by the 275 nm uv led showed a better persistence against reactivation which could be attributed to protein damage at 275 nm no synergistic effect for combined wavelengths was observed in this study the electrical energy consumption was lower for the 275 nm uv led than the other uv leds which was attributed to its higher wall plug efficiency this study showed the variation principle between the single and combined uvb uvc leds in inactivation efficiency inhibition of reactivation synergistic effect and electrical energy consumption in treatment of e coli which is useful for the reasonable exploitation of uv leds in water disinfection systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv led disinfection inactivation reactivation synergistic effect electrical energy efficiency 1 introduction uv irradiation with wavelengths in the germicidal range 200 320 nm is the latest method of modern water and wastewater treatment kowalski 2009 currently low pressure lp and medium pressure mp mercury lamp emitting monochromatic emission at a wavelength of 253 7 nm and polychromatic emission light at a broad range of wavelengths 200 600 nm respectively are widely employed as a uv source in drinking water and wastewater treatment plants bolton and cotton 2011 the efficacy and the doses needed using these mercury lamps are well established for various pathogens which include bacteria protozoan parasites and viruses abbaszadegan et al 1997 the newly emerging ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led is a potential alternative of traditional uv mercury lamps because of the advantages such as diversity in wavelengths environmental friendliness no mercury compactness robustness faster start up time excluding warm up potentially less energy consumption longer lifetime and the ability to turn on and off with high frequency würtele et al 2011 in addition uv led reactors can best be utilized in small scale which is especially convenient in remote areas in view of cost crawford et al 2005 lui et al 2014 such uv leds are wide band gap semiconductors composed mostly of gallium nitride gan and aluminum gallium nitride algan although the wall plug efficiency wpe of uv mercury lamps 15 35 is higher than that of uv leds 1 3 the latter is expected to be improved significantly being similar to the case seen in visible leds harris et al 2013 for uv leds to be applied as a practical option several studies have examined their application in inactivation of pathogens for water disinfection several of these studies have reported that uv leds at wavelength around 265 nm have a relatively higher inactivation of microorganisms than other wavelengths in the uvb and uvc 200 300 nm range chatterley and linden 2010 bowker et al 2011 chevremont et al 2012a oguma et al 2013 beck et al 2017 rattanakul and oguma 2018 li et al 2017 the inactivation by the uvb and uvc radiation is effected through the formation of lesions in the genomic dna of the organisms the major dna lesions induced by the uv light are cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpds pyrimidine 6 4 pyrimidone photoproducts 6 4 pps and their dewar isomers ravanat et al 2001 sinha and häder 2002 cadet et al 2005 friedberg et al 2006 the presence of these uv induced lesions would inhibit the normal replication of dna resulting in inactivation of the microorganisms however some microorganisms particularly bacteria are capable of reactivating by repairing their damaged dna after uv irradiation by mechanisms such as photoreactivation and excision repair dark repair friedberg et al 1995 harm 1980 this will greatly decrease the final inactivation result and thereafter health risks of infection when uv radiation is used for microbial disinfection in water photoreactivation is a process where microorganisms utilize light in the wavelength range of 330 480 nm to activate a photolyase enzyme which binds specifically to the cpds cpd photolyase or 6 4 pps 6 4 photolyase and directly monomerizes the cyclobutane ring of the pyr pyr and protects the genome from deleterious effects of uv radiation whereas excision repair dark repair is a multistep where an abnormal or damaged base is removed by two major subpathways i base excision repair ber and ii nucleotide excision repair ner rastogi et al 2010 previous studies have indicated that medium pressure mp uv lamps have the ability to repress photoreactivation of escherichia coli e coli oguma et al 2004 it has been suggested that the repressed photoreactivation is due to the irreversible oxidative damage to photolyase by mp uv quek and hu 2008 another study also assumed that the mp uv irradiation resulted in less photoreactivation due to induced damage to proteins other than dna itself kalisvaart 2004 in addition mp uv emission wavelengths of 220 300 nm was reported to reduce the subsequent photorepair of e coli by causing a disorder with endogenous photolyase a dna repair enzyme oguma et al 2002 the dna of most of the microorganisms is believed to have an absorption maximum between 260 and 270 nm lechevallier and kwok keung 2004 gates 1930 meanwhile the proteins that are responsible for infection usually show absorption maximum between 275 and 280 nm which is caused by the absorbance of aromatic amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine and cystine i e of disulfide bonds schmid 2001 therefore repression of photoreactivation can be attributed to protein damage at a wavelength between 275 and 280 nm though more studies should be conducted to confirm this hypothesis since effectiveness of uv light for inactivating microorganisms is in the uv b and uv c ranges of the spectrum 200 310 nm similar to mp uv lamp repression of the reactivation by uv leds is possible which has also been reported in the recent study specifically the 280 nm uv led was found able to significantly repress reactivation li et al 2017 however the uv leds are characterized by diversity in wavelengths whereas mp uv lamp emits a continuous and broad spectrum of germicidal wavelengths therefore the combination of uv leds of different wavelengths may be necessary to suppress effectively the reactivation this raises the study on the inactivation effect using the combined uv leds the synergistic effect is normally determined by comparing the results of log inactivation by combined disinfection treatments and the results from the sum of log inactivation by individual treatments koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 till now a synergistic effect after application of uv leds disinfection systems has only been reported in quite few references chevremont et al 2012a nakahashi et al 2014 green et al 2018 some studies even reported contrasting finding of no synergistic effect oguma et al 2013 beck et al 2017 li et al 2017 nevertheless the effectiveness of both inactivation and reactivation in cases of the combined uv leds is of great importance for water disinfection electrical energy efficiency is another factor involved in making an economically reasonable decision when designing disinfection systems it is characterized by a parameter known as electrical energy per order eeo which has been previously used for interpreting collimated beam data to estimate electrical efficiencies of lp uv and mp uv lamps for large scale treatment of chemical contaminants sharpless and linden 2005 therefore the same parameter of electrical energy per order eeo can be applied in uv led disinfection systems to determine their electrical energy efficiency however up to date only a few studies have considered both inactivation and electrical energy efficiency in one study the inactivation and electrical energy efficiency of 260 280 and 260 280 nm uv leds were compared beck et al 2017 for e coli inactivation in particular the results of 260 nm and 280 nm uv leds were not statistically different which contradicts the earlier findings that the relative peak of bactericidal effectiveness is between 260 and 270 nm gates 1930 however it was reported that the electrical energy efficiency of the 280 nm uv led and the 260 280 nm uv led combination was less than the 260 nm uv led in another study the 265 280 and 300 nm uv leds were used in inactivation of e coli bacillus subtilis spores bacteriophage q β pseudomonas aeruginosa and legionella pneumophila rattanakul and oguma 2018 it was reported that although the 265 nm uv led had higher inactivation efficiency the 280 nm uv led showed the lowest energy consumption the differences in the electrical energy consumption were attributed to difference in wall plug efficiency note that the wall plug efficiency radiant efficiency is the energy conversion efficiency with which the system converts electrical power into optical power in other words the wall plug efficiency is defined as the ratio of the radiant flux total optical output power of the device to the input electrical power barnes 2007 however we think that not only does the electrical energy consumption depend on wall plug efficiency but also on the water factor and the sensitivity of the microorganism at a particular wavelength as shown above the studies on application of uv leds for water disinfection are insufficient and from the few published ones discrepancies exist on important factors such as inactivation efficiency repression of reactivation of microorganisms after uv irradiation combined effect of different wavelengths and electrical energy efficiency therefore in this study these factors are evaluated with special attention on the potential synergistic effect of combined uv led wavelengths we believe that the results from this work will provide additional and beneficial information for consideration in application of uv leds for water disinfection systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 culturing and enumeration of microorganisms in this study e coli was chosen as a model microbe because the presence of e coli itself is a good indication on the presence of pathogens and they are a good measure of overall water quality jackson et al 2001 a pure culture of e coli strain cgmcc 1 3373 provided by china general microbiological culture collection centre cgmcc were incubated in a shaker incubator in luria bertani lb broth at 37 c and 200 rpm for 5 6 h until log phase was reached determined by measurement of od600 the cells were collected by centrifugation 10 000 rpm 10 min and 4 c washed twice with a sterilized saline solution 0 85 and then suspended in sterilized saline solution at a concentration of approximately 10 6 cfu ml determined by standard plate count method and measurement of od600 through the uv 1780 uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan un irradiated n0 and irradiated samples n were collected respectively at time zero and exposure times t s for enumeration both un irradiated and irradiated immediately after irradiation and after exposure to light and dark conditions samples were serially diluted before using the plate streaking technique volumes of 100 μl of the diluted samples were spread on lb agar plate in triplicate and incubated while inverted at 37 c for 18 20 h plates yielding 1 to 300 colonies were considered for analysis deionized water was used for all experiments e g cultivation irradiation and enumeration in this study 2 2 uv led and fluence measurement uv leds with emissions at 265 275 and 310 nm and optical power output of 1 8 1 6 and 1 3 mw respectively at current of 20 20 20 ma achieved at voltages of 6 0 3 9 and 6 0 v respectively great bright company china were used the emission spectra fig 1 a of the uv leds were measured with spectro 320 optical scanning spectrometer and exhibited peak emission wavelengths at 267 275 and 310 nm with full widths at half maximum fwhm of 12 nm 10 5 nm and 8 9 nm respectively the uv leds were soldered in single boards and fixed with pins to a circular board of 50 mm diameter to form a 24 mm square array consisting of three rows of three uv leds the batch reactor contained an array of nine single wavelength or a combination of 5 and 4 uv leds each connected in series and fixed in a board a magnetic stirrer power source and a microbial sample in a petri dish fig 1b irradiance was measured at the same water surface level using il 1700 radiometer with sed 270 detector international light usa an equivalent irradiance of around 0 384 mw cm2 was used in all the uv leds to achieve this current voltage was varied using one keithley power source fig s1 for single wavelength and for two wavelength combinations two keithley power sources fig s2 were used the fluence was a product of irradiance and exposure time t s bolton and linden 2003 2 3 uv irradiations all the uv irradiation were conducted inside a clean chamber with a fan that maintain the chamber temperature at 25 4 c fig s3 at the same time the fan helped to maintain the temperature of the powered uv leds at a temperature of 31 4 c fig s4 which was within the manufacturer s requirement 2 3 1 inactivation experiments before uv irradiation 20 ml of microbial suspension was obtained from the suspended bacteria cells in the sterilized saline solution at a concentration of approximately 10 6 cfu ml 5 ml was taken away for bacterial count and the rest 15 ml was placed in a petri dish with 60 mm diameter 6 mm water depth for irradiation for the uv leds to reach stable emission stage they were powered on for 5 min before irradiation while being stirred with a sterile magnetic stir bar the microbial suspension was irradiated at 2 2 cm from the uv led source for changing the different samples the uv leds were powered off for less than 30 s which did not have a significant effect on the irradiance uv irradiation was done for all single and combined wavelengths in this study samples were taken followed by steps of serial dilution plating incubation and enumeration 2 3 2 reactivation experiments to investigate if the 275 nm has a repressive effect on microorganisms reactivation after uv irradiation the irradiation was done using the 267 275 267 275 and the 275 310 nm uv leds at a fluence that led to 3 0 and 4 0 log inactivation same as in section 2 3 1 before uv irradiation 20 ml of microbial suspension was prepared 5 ml taken away for bacterial count and the rest 15 ml was placed in a petri dish for irradiation immediately after irradiation 5 ml of the bacterial sample was transferred into 5 ml glass tube for bacterial count and the rest was used to perform reactivation process the reactivations were conducted at controlled room temperature since any change in temperature affects reactivation salcedo et al 2007 fluorescent lamp 15 w philips with a peak emission at 395 nm was placed at a distance of 30 cm from the samples the reactivation period was 9 h and bacteria samples were collected at interval of 1 5 h dark repair was carried out in a dark box for the same time period and temperature as the samples exposed to the light each reactivation experiment was conducted three times and both un irradiated samples n0 samples immediately after irradiation n and after reactivation nt were taken followed by steps of serial dilution plating incubation and enumeration 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 inactivation kinetics the fluence inactivation response curve of some microorganisms including e coli has been observed to have a shoulder at low fluence a log linear phase at increasing fluence and a tailing phase at high fluence webb and brown 1976 severin et al 1983 mossel et al 1995 cerf 1997 rattanakul and oguma 2018 in this study therefore we used the shoulder model which does not consider the tailing phase eq 1 hijnen et al 2006 1 l o g n 0 n k f l u e n c e b where n 0 and n is the number of colony cfu ml before and immediately after uv irradiation b is the y intercept a negative value since the curve is crossing the fluence axis at the uv fluence where log linear relationship starts offset 2 4 2 reactivation kinetics 2 4 2 1 quantitative evaluation of reactivation to evaluate the effect of reactivation the percentage of reactivation either due to photoreactivation or dark repair was quantified using eq 2 lindenauer and darby 1994 2 percentage of reactivation n t n n 0 n 100 where n0 is the cell number before uv irradiation cfu ml n is the immediate cell number after uv irradiation cfu ml nt is the cell number after reactivation for a period of time t cfu ml in addition the reactivation can be expressed as a function of the survival ratio eq 3 in respect of the initial microorganism concentration before the inactivation process kashimada et al 1996 3 s n t n 0 100 where s is the survival ratio at time t n0 and nt have the same meaning as above 2 4 2 2 modelling photoreactivation a non linear regression model was used to model photoreactivation eq 4 nebot sanz et al 2007 salcedo et al 2007 4 s s m 1 s m s 0 1 e k 2 s m t where sm is the maximum limit of the microorganisms survival by reactivation and s0 is the survival ratio immediately after uv irradiation k2 is the growth second order reactivation rate constant note that k2 is not a pure reactivation rate constant it is rather a model parameter that is adjusted to predict the experimental data whose physical meaning is related to the time required to reach sm and then the stabilization phase nebot sanz et al 2007 salcedo et al 2007 therefore a pure reactivation rate constant k eq 5 can be obtained from the derivatives of eq 4 and its maximum value eq 6 is obtained when s reaches half of sm li et al 2017 5 k ds dt k 2 s m s s 6 k max k 2 s m 2 4 2 4 2 3 modelling dark repair a model that considers a low and brief reactivation period and a decay phase was used in modelling dark repair 7 nebot sanz et al 2007 salcedo et al 2007 7 s s m 1 s m s 0 1 e k 2 s m t m t where m is the mortality a zero order decay rate constant while the other parameters have the same meaning as in eq 4 note that sm k2 kr and m in eqs 4 and 5 have a clear physical significance 2 5 synergy of inactivation synergistic effect of combined wavelengths on microorganism inactivation was compared from the results of log inactivation by combined uv leds and the results from the sum of log inactivation by individual uv leds therefore the synergy values can be calculated using eq 8 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 8 s y n e r g y l o g u n i t s l o g i n a c

n log reduction of microorganisms can be determined using eq 9 beck et al 2017 9 e e n a f n 3 6 10 3 v c wf where ee n is the electrical energy for a specific n log reduction of each sample in kwh m 3 a is the irradiant surface area c m 2 and fn is the fluence required for n log reduction mj c m 2 the value of 3 6 103 is a unit conversion constant for w and kw s and h ml and m3 v is the volume of

of the water in the petri dish the values of wf are shown in table 1 note that the decadic absorption coefficient absorbance for a 1 cm path length for the single wavelengths was determined using a 1 cm diameter quartz cuvette and uv 1780 uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan the cuvette was filled with sterilized saline water solution that was used as a medium in the disinfection experiments and inserted in the uv vis spectrophotometer the absorbance values measurement for the combined wavelengths the absorbance was approximated as the average of the absorbance values of the respective combined wavelengths values of decadic absorption coefficient of different wavelengths are shown in are shown in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli inactivation by uv leds inactivation profile of e coli by different uv led wavelengths is shown in fig 2 a shoulder and tailing were observed in this study the shoulder could have been due to fluence dependent repair process and the threshold value represents the number of sites of an organism that must be destroyed before inactivation occurs webb and brown 1976 severin et al 1983 mossel et al 1995 tailing on the other hand may have resulted from individuals in a population cultured from a pure colony that was not identical with respect to disinfection or due to aggregation of microbial suspension that occurs during treatment cerf 1997 inactivation rate was obtained from log linear part on fluence response curve the 267 nm uv led had a higher log inactivation than the other wavelengths followed by the 267 275 275 nm uv led and the 310 nm uv led was the least fig 2 in addition the 267 nm uv led had a higher k value of 0 42 fig 3 which is similar to the reported value of 0 43 and 0 41 respectively in refs oguma et al 2013 li et al 2017 the k value at 275 nm uv led was 0 292 which was lower than 0 422 reported in ref bowker et al 2011 this may be due to different experimental set up and use of different e coli strain however k value of 0 292 at 275 nm in this work was similar that of 0 29 and 0 30 both at 280 nm in ref oguma et al s work 2013 and li et al 2017 respectively this is reasonable because the 275 nm is close to 280 nm note that for the 267 275 nm uv led combined k 0 391 was greater than k 0 292 for the 275 nm uv led this could have been caused by the higher germicidal effect at 267 nm in the combined wavelength which is the relative peak of bactericidal effectiveness as earlier reported in literature gates 1930 the k values of the other single and combined wavelengths were the lowest and any combination having the 267 nm uv led its k value slightly increased showing that the 267 nm uv led had an influence on inactivation efficiency of the combined uv leds though the k values were not used earlier green et al 2018 the inactivation efficacy and performance of uv leds emitting at 259 268 275 289 and 370 nm were effectively compared against a low pressure mercury lamp at 253 7 nm for e coli listeria and salmonella pathogens using log count reduction lcr at an equivalent uv dose 7 mj cm 2 the uv leds emitting at 259 and 268 nm achieved the highest lcr out of the tested wavelengths which is in agreement with our results in the case of the 267 nm in our work the fluence required to attain above 3 0 log and 4 0 log inactivation was 8 78 10 09 12 26 mj c m 2 and 11 52 15 35 and 23 04 mj c m 2 respectively for the 267 267 275 275 nm respectively while for the other uv leds they required a relatively higher fluence at the same log inactivation this finding is in agreement with the previous studies chatterley and linden 2010 bowker et al 2011 chevremont et al 2012a oguma et al 2013 beck et al 2017 rattanakul and oguma 2018 li et al 2017 compared to the other uv leds the 267 nm uv led required a lower fluence of 8 78 mj c m 2 to attain above 3 0 log inactivation for e coli 3 2 photoreactivation the photoreactivation percentages from the samples irradiated by the 275 nm uv led was statistically lower p 0 005 than the other uv leds in this study in both the 3 0 log and 4 0 log inactivation fig 4 note that the irradiation by the 267 nm uv led had a higher inactivation efficiency than the 310 275 and 267 257 nm uv leds irradiation however the photoreactivation percentages after the 310 275 and 267 275 nm uv leds irradiation were statistically lower p 0 05 than those for the 267 nm uv leds irradiation fig 4 this observation can be attributed to the presence of 275 nm in the 310 275 nm combination which helped to lower photoreactivation percentages this finding is in agreement with previous study which reported that e coli photoreactivation was significantly repressed at 280 nm which is also close to 275 nm in our study li et al 2017 in another previous study adenovirus was effectively inactivated by the 285 nm uv led irradiation and the effective inactivation was attributed to proteins damage oguma et al 2016 the mechanism of inactivation by the mp uv lamp which is capable of repressing e coli reactivation after uv irradiation may partly be attributed to damage to proteins which show absorption maximum between 275 and 280 nm schmid 2001 by considering photoreactivation the log inactivation decreased drastically as photoreactivation time increased the decrease was lower for the 275 nm uv led leading to significantly higher log inactivation p 0 005 than the 267 267 275 and 275 310 nm uv leds in both 3 0 log and 4 0 log inactivation fig 5 a and b therefore the repressive effect observed at 275 nm in this study may be attributed to protein damage which is irreparable by the dna repair mechanisms the lower percentage of photoreactivation in both the uv leds at a higher fluence 4 0 log inactivation fig 4b as compared to lower fluence 3 0 log inactivation fig 4a explains also the need of increasing fluence on minimizing photoreactivation which is in agreement with previous research studies lindenauer and darby 1994 nebot sanz et al 2007 the model described in eq 4 was applied to the photoreactivation experimental data using non linear regression a good fit of the model to the photoreactivation experimental data was observed fig 6 the asymptotic shape of the curves was obtained which were consistent with a typical inactivation reactivation curve nebot sanz et al 2007 salcedo et al 2007 table 2 gives the values of the estimated kinetic parameters s m and k 2 both s m and k 2 showed a consistent behavior with the fluence that led to 3 0 log and 4 0 log inactivation s m showed a negative exponential tendency with the fluence which indicates that high fluence 4 0 log inactivation produce severe damage on bacteria making their reactivation low while low fluence 3 0 log inactivation allows the photoreactivation to take place on the other hand k 2 showed an inverse tendency in which it increased with the fluence however the increase in k 2 with the fluence is due to k 2 is not a pure reactivation rate constant as earlier explained and therefore k m a x eq 6 was used to interpret the rate of reactivation as in the case of s m k m a x also showed a negative exponential tendency with the fluence indicating that high fluence reduces k m a x the 275 nm uv led had the lowest s m and k r m a x as compared to the 267 267 275 and 275 130 nm uv leds in both the 3 0 and 4 0 log inactivation table 2 note that the low s m and k m a x indicates an extended induction phase and a short exponential phase fig 6 and therefore the 275 nm uv led could reduce both the s m and k m a x which means that photoreactivation can be inhibited by uv leds at 275 nm 3 3 dark repair the lowest dark repair percentages were found in the irradiation by the 275 nm uv led than the 265 275 310 and 265 275 nm uv leds in both the 3 0 log and 4 0 log inactivation the negative values of the dark repair percentages indicates a decay phase where the colony count was below the initial count immediately before the dark conditions fig 7 although the dark repair percentages below 0 02 were much lower than photoreactivation percentages above 0 13 any bacteria survival can cause harmful effect to human being the low dark repair percentages led to insignificant differences in log inactivation in both the 3 0 and the 4 0 log inactivation fig 8 both reactivation and a decay phase occurred in dark repair which was not the case in photoreactivation for a period of 9 h the dark repair survival curves showed a low and short reactivation period followed by a dominating decay phase a good fit of the model eq 7 to the dark repair experimental data was obtained fig 9 a and b this finding was in agreement with the previous studies in refs nebot sanz et al 2007 salcedo et al 2007 however there was disagreement in the reports of the recent study where only reactivation was reported during the dark repair li et al 2017 according to our results we think that the slow reactivation and keeping the bacteria sample in absence of any source of food or light can lead to a decay phase the values of the dark repair kinetic parameters s m k 2 k m a x were determined as earlier explained and m mortality rate constant was calculated experimentally from the slope of the linear end of the survival curves between the 4 5 h and the final 9 h the s m and k m a x values for the 275 nm uv led were lower than those for the 265 275 310 and 265 275 nm uv leds in addition the s m and k m a x values decreased with the increase in fluence which was a similar observation in photoreactivation table 3 however the decrease of sm and kmax in the dark repair was small of the order 10 1 and 10 2 as compared to that in photoreactivation of the order 10 1 and 10 0 respectively this is an indication of a low and short reactivation in dark repair the parameter m seems to be independent on both fluence and wavelength with average values between 1 2 10 3 2 8 10 3 survival h in addition there is no significant change of m when either wavelength of fluence changes on the other hand the m values are very small because during the 4 5 h of reactivation a maximum survival of microorganisms of approximately 0 121 and 0 019 for the 3 0 and 4 0 log inactivation respectively will be produced the mortality rate may be attributed to the residual effect of a radiation on the bacterial dna and therefore will be independent on fluence and wavelength as observed in this study the residual effect of radiation on the bacterial dna occurs due to biochemical mechanism of actuation which needs some time to be manifested completely hence it is also possible that the mortality does not occur in photoreactivation experiments because in this situation the repair of damaged dna is more effective nebot sanz et al 2007 this explanation of possibility of absence of mortality in photoreactivation is in agreement with our finding therefore though reactivation occurred after microorganisms uv irradiation the occurrence was lesser in dark repair demonstrating that photo effect is the dominant mechanism of reactivation therefore our results demonstrated that the 275 nm uv led showed better persistence against reactivation than the 265 275 310 and 265 275 nm uv leds which is may be attributable to protein damage at 275 nm 3 4 effect of combining different wavelengths synergistic effect of 267 275 267 310 and 275 310 nm uv led combinations was investigated from observation the sum of log inactivation by individual uv leds that were weighted by their respective average irradiance percentages is equal to the log inactivation from those wavelengths combined fig 10 the same observation was confirmed by using an independent two tailed paired t test i e the difference between the sum of the log inactivation proportions from individual uv leds and the log inactivation from those wavelengths combined was not statistically significant p 0 05 this work indicates that there is no synergistic effect from 267 275 267 310 and 275 310 nm uv leds combinations in inactivating e coli our finding is in agreement with previous studies oguma et al 2013 beck et al 2017 li et al 2017 and also agreed with the second law of photochemistry stark einstein law which states that for each photon of light absorbed by a chemical system only one molecule is activated for subsequent reaction in other words any photochemical effects of different wavelengths on a molecule should be independent of each other achieving only as such inactivation as the sum of the photonic response from the individual wavelengths emitting separately however our study disagreed with other previous reports on presence of synergistic effect in green et al s study 2018 it was argued that synergistic effect following uv treatment at 259 289 nm was as a result of alternative inactivation mechanisms at 289 nm leading to a hurdle effect this may not be true because 289 nm is within the uvb uvc wavelengths whose mechanism of microorganism inactivation is similar ravanat et al 2001 sinha and häder 2002 cadet et al 2005 friedberg et al 2006 on the other hand the synergistic effect was reported on uvc and uva combination chevremont et al 2012a nakahashi et al 2014 in this case we think that the synergistic effect may exist because the mechanism of inactivation at uva 320 400 nm is believed to be different from that at uvc or uvb irradiation by uva wavelengths is believed to cause lethal and mutagenic damage to an organism and in low doses it induces many physiological alterations mainly the well known radioinduced growth inhibition as reported in literature favre et al 1985 eisenstark 1989 therefore more research should be performed at uva uvc with different microorganisms to confirm these previous reports 3 5 electrical energy efficiency in any research involving pathogen inactivation it is necessary to determine the electrical energy efficiency ee n of any uv source used in our study the 267 275 310 267 275 267 310 and 267 310 nm uv leds were used the ee 1 and ee 2 were calculated using eq 9 the 275 nm uv led required lower electrical energy of 0 1367 and 0 2219 kwh m3 for ee 1 and ee 2 respectively in inactivation of e coli as compared to ee 1 and ee 2 by the other uv leds fig 11 the lower ee n of the 275 nm uv led can be attributable to the higher wall plug efficiency of 0 021 compared to that of other uv leds the 310 nm uv led in this study had higher ee 1 of 1 7576 kwh m3 this is because the germicidal effect is low at this wavelength as earlier explained and the wall plug efficiency of 0 011 could not have helped to lower its ee 1 however compared to the 310 nm uv led alone a combination with 267 or 275 nm uv leds led to lower ee 1 this is because the higher germicidal effect at the 267 and 275 nm helped in the lowering the ee n in the combined wavelengths hence suggesting that the 310 nm uv led only is not good but a combination with other leds is much better in lowering ee n the results of our work agreed with previous study in ref beck et al 2017 where it was reported that the electrical energy per order ee 0 of 0 347 kwh m3 by the 280 nm uv led was slightly lower than 0 464 and 0 379 kwh m3 by the 260 and 260 280 nm uv leds respectively this is because the wall plug efficiency of 0 005 by the 280 nm uv led was slightly higher than the wall plug efficiency of 0 004 and 0 00444 by the 260 nm and 260 280 nm uv leds our study also agreed with another previous study in which the 280 nm uv leds required lower ee 3 of 0 17 as compared to 0 41 and 1 22 kwh m3 by the 265 and 300 nm uv leds respectively rattanakul and oguma 2018 this is because the 280 nm uv led had a higher wall plug efficiency of 0 019 as compared to 0 006 for the 265 nm uv led the wall plug efficiency of 0 026 for the 300 nm uv led lowered its ee n but not as much as the 275 nm uv led which is attributable to the lower germicidal effect of microorganisms at 310 nm as earlier explained our work has also shown that not only does the electrical energy efficiency depend on the wall plug efficiency but also on the vulnerability of microorganism at a given wavelength which determines the fluence fn required to inactivate it as represented in eq 9 4 conclusions different uv leds were used to study the inactivation of e coli in a batch water disinfection system the 267 nm uv led had the highest inactivation efficiency than other uv leds for the reactivation after irradiation it was found that the dark repair was lower than photoreactivation demonstrating that photo effect is the dominant mechanism of reactivation in dark repair the decay phase was more prominent than reactivation however irradiation by the 275 nm uv led showed better persistence against reactivation this was attributable to the higher possibility of damage to proteins at 275 nm no synergistic effect for combined wavelengths was observed the electrical energy consumption for the 275 nm uv led was lower than the other uv leds in this study which is attributable to its higher wall plug efficiency compared with 310 nm only however a combination with 267 or 275 nm can significantly lower its electrical energy consumption by considering repression of microorganisms reactivation after uv irradiation and lower electrical energy consumption due to improved wall plug efficiency the 275 nm uv led is concluded to be a better and a promising option in water disinfection note that the electrical energy calculated only reflects the effect of specific wavelengths on specific microbe used in this work in addition the water used in this study did not contain any organic matter which may change the response therefore detailed studies will be necessary with water containing organic matter e g surface or lake water and highly resistant pathogens to elucidate the practical application to tap and waste water treatment in both

19254,ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds have shown a potential to replace traditional ultraviolet uv pressure lamps for water disinfection however the research is not sufficient and hence it is still difficult to make any logical conclusions in this work uv leds with peak emissions at 267 275 310 nm and combined emissions at 267 275 267 310 and 275 310 nm were applied to a batch water disinfection system under either single or combined wavelength situation the inactivation efficiency reactivation due to photoreactivation and dark repair after uv irradiation and electrical energy consumption were evaluated by way of the model bacterium escherichia coli it was found that the 267 nm uv led had the highest inactivation efficiency than other uv leds although reactivation occurred after 267 275 267 275 and 275 310 nm uv leds irradiations it occurred to a lesser extent in dark repair than in photoreactivation demonstrating that photo effect is the dominant mechanism of reactivation in addition decay phase was more prominent than reactivation in dark repair however the irradiation by the 275 nm uv led showed a better persistence against reactivation which could be attributed to protein damage at 275 nm no synergistic effect for combined wavelengths was observed in this study the electrical energy consumption was lower for the 275 nm uv led than the other uv leds which was attributed to its higher wall plug efficiency this study showed the variation principle between the single and combined uvb uvc leds in inactivation efficiency inhibition of reactivation synergistic effect and electrical energy consumption in treatment of e coli which is useful for the reasonable exploitation of uv leds in water disinfection systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv led disinfection inactivation reactivation synergistic effect electrical energy efficiency 1 introduction uv irradiation with wavelengths in the germicidal range 200 320 nm is the latest method of modern water and wastewater treatment kowalski 2009 currently low pressure lp and medium pressure mp mercury lamp emitting monochromatic emission at a wavelength of 253 7 nm and polychromatic emission light at a broad range of wavelengths 200 600 nm respectively are widely employed as a uv source in drinking water and wastewater treatment plants bolton and cotton 2011 the efficacy and the doses needed using these mercury lamps are well established for various pathogens which include bacteria protozoan parasites and viruses abbaszadegan et al 1997 the newly emerging ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led is a potential alternative of traditional uv mercury lamps because of the advantages such as diversity in wavelengths environmental friendliness no mercury compactness robustness faster start up time excluding warm up potentially less energy consumption longer lifetime and the ability to turn on and off with high frequency würtele et al 2011 in addition uv led reactors can best be utilized in small scale which is especially convenient in remote areas in view of cost crawford et al 2005 lui et al 2014 such uv leds are wide band gap semiconductors composed mostly of gallium nitride gan and aluminum gallium nitride algan although the wall plug efficiency wpe of uv mercury lamps 15 35 is higher than that of uv leds 1 3 the latter is expected to be improved significantly being similar to the case seen in visible leds harris et al 2013 for uv leds to be applied as a practical option several studies have examined their application in inactivation of pathogens for water disinfection several of these studies have reported that uv leds at wavelength around 265 nm have a relatively higher inactivation of microorganisms than other wavelengths in the uvb and uvc 200 300 nm range chatterley and linden 2010 bowker et al 2011 chevremont et al 2012a oguma et al 2013 beck et al 2017 rattanakul and oguma 2018 li et al 2017 the inactivation by the uvb and uvc radiation is effected through the formation of lesions in the genomic dna of the organisms the major dna lesions induced by the uv light are cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpds pyrimidine 6 4 pyrimidone photoproducts 6 4 pps and their dewar isomers ravanat et al 2001 sinha and häder 2002 cadet et al 2005 friedberg et al 2006 the presence of these uv induced lesions would inhibit the normal replication of dna resulting in inactivation of the microorganisms however some microorganisms particularly bacteria are capable of reactivating by repairing their damaged dna after uv irradiation by mechanisms such as photoreactivation and excision repair dark repair friedberg et al 1995 harm 1980 this will greatly decrease the final inactivation result and thereafter health risks of infection when uv radiation is used for microbial disinfection in water photoreactivation is a process where microorganisms utilize light in the wavelength range of 330 480 nm to activate a photolyase enzyme which binds specifically to the cpds cpd photolyase or 6 4 pps 6 4 photolyase and directly monomerizes the cyclobutane ring of the pyr pyr and protects the genome from deleterious effects of uv radiation whereas excision repair dark repair is a multistep where an abnormal or damaged base is removed by two major subpathways i base excision repair ber and ii nucleotide excision repair ner rastogi et al 2010 previous studies have indicated that medium pressure mp uv lamps have the ability to repress photoreactivation of escherichia coli e coli oguma et al 2004 it has been suggested that the repressed photoreactivation is due to the irreversible oxidative damage to photolyase by mp uv quek and hu 2008 another study also assumed that the mp uv irradiation resulted in less photoreactivation due to induced damage to proteins other than dna itself kalisvaart 2004 in addition mp uv emission wavelengths of 220 300 nm was reported to reduce the subsequent photorepair of e coli by causing a disorder with endogenous photolyase a dna repair enzyme oguma et al 2002 the dna of most of the microorganisms is believed to have an absorption maximum between 260 and 270 nm lechevallier and kwok keung 2004 gates 1930 meanwhile the proteins that are responsible for infection usually show absorption maximum between 275 and 280 nm which is caused by the absorbance of aromatic amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine and cystine i e of disulfide bonds schmid 2001 therefore repression of photoreactivation can be attributed to protein damage at a wavelength between 275 and 280 nm though more studies should be conducted to confirm this hypothesis since effectiveness of uv light for inactivating microorganisms is in the uv b and uv c ranges of the spectrum 200 310 nm similar to mp uv lamp repression of the reactivation by uv leds is possible which has also been reported in the recent study specifically the 280 nm uv led was found able to significantly repress reactivation li et al 2017 however the uv leds are characterized by diversity in wavelengths whereas mp uv lamp emits a continuous and broad spectrum of germicidal wavelengths therefore the combination of uv leds of different wavelengths may be necessary to suppress effectively the reactivation this raises the study on the inactivation effect using the combined uv leds the synergistic effect is normally determined by comparing the results of log inactivation by combined disinfection treatments and the results from the sum of log inactivation by individual treatments koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 till now a synergistic effect after application of uv leds disinfection systems has only been reported in quite few references chevremont et al 2012a nakahashi et al 2014 green et al 2018 some studies even reported contrasting finding of no synergistic effect oguma et al 2013 beck et al 2017 li et al 2017 nevertheless the effectiveness of both inactivation and reactivation in cases of the combined uv leds is of great importance for water disinfection electrical energy efficiency is another factor involved in making an economically reasonable decision when designing disinfection systems it is characterized by a parameter known as electrical energy per order eeo which has been previously used for interpreting collimated beam data to estimate electrical efficiencies of lp uv and mp uv lamps for large scale treatment of chemical contaminants sharpless and linden 2005 therefore the same parameter of electrical energy per order eeo can be applied in uv led disinfection systems to determine their electrical energy efficiency however up to date only a few studies have considered both inactivation and electrical energy efficiency in one study the inactivation and electrical energy efficiency of 260 280 and 260 280 nm uv leds were compared beck et al 2017 for e coli inactivation in particular the results of 260 nm and 280 nm uv leds were not statistically different which contradicts the earlier findings that the relative peak of bactericidal effectiveness is between 260 and 270 nm gates 1930 however it was reported that the electrical energy efficiency of the 280 nm uv led and the 260 280 nm uv led combination was less than the 260 nm uv led in another study the 265 280 and 300 nm uv leds were used in inactivation of e coli bacillus subtilis spores bacteriophage q β pseudomonas aeruginosa and legionella pneumophila rattanakul and oguma 2018 it was reported that although the 265 nm uv led had higher inactivation efficiency the 280 nm uv led showed the lowest energy consumption the differences in the electrical energy consumption were attributed to difference in wall plug efficiency note that the wall plug efficiency radiant efficiency is the energy conversion efficiency with which the system converts electrical power into optical power in other words the wall plug efficiency is defined as the ratio of the radiant flux total optical output power of the device to the input electrical power barnes 2007 however we think that not only does the electrical energy consumption depend on wall plug efficiency but also on the water factor and the sensitivity of the microorganism at a particular wavelength as shown above the studies on application of uv leds for water disinfection are insufficient and from the few published ones discrepancies exist on important factors such as inactivation efficiency repression of reactivation of microorganisms after uv irradiation combined effect of different wavelengths and electrical energy efficiency therefore in this study these factors are evaluated with special attention on the potential synergistic effect of combined uv led wavelengths we believe that the results from this work will provide additional and beneficial information for consideration in application of uv leds for water disinfection systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 culturing and enumeration of microorganisms in this study e coli was chosen as a model microbe because the presence of e coli itself is a good indication on the presence of pathogens and they are a good measure of overall water quality jackson et al 2001 a pure culture of e coli strain cgmcc 1 3373 provided by china general microbiological culture collection centre cgmcc were incubated in a shaker incubator in luria bertani lb broth at 37 c and 200 rpm for 5 6 h until log phase was reached determined by measurement of od600 the cells were collected by centrifugation 10 000 rpm 10 min and 4 c washed twice with a sterilized saline solution 0 85 and then suspended in sterilized saline solution at a concentration of approximately 10 6 cfu ml determined by standard plate count method and measurement of od600 through the uv 1780 uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan un irradiated n0 and irradiated samples n were collected respectively at time zero and exposure times t s for enumeration both un irradiated and irradiated immediately after irradiation and after exposure to light and dark conditions samples were serially diluted before using the plate streaking technique volumes of 100 μl of the diluted samples were spread on lb agar plate in triplicate and incubated while inverted at 37 c for 18 20 h plates yielding 1 to 300 colonies were considered for analysis deionized water was used for all experiments e g cultivation irradiation and enumeration in this study 2 2 uv led and fluence measurement uv leds with emissions at 265 275 and 310 nm and optical power output of 1 8 1 6 and 1 3 mw respectively at current of 20 20 20 ma achieved at voltages of 6 0 3 9 and 6 0 v respectively great bright company china were used the emission spectra fig 1 a of the uv leds were measured with spectro 320 optical scanning spectrometer and exhibited peak emission wavelengths at 267 275 and 310 nm with full widths at half maximum fwhm of 12 nm 10 5 nm and 8 9 nm respectively the uv leds were soldered in single boards and fixed with pins to a circular board of 50 mm diameter to form a 24 mm square array consisting of three rows of three uv leds the batch reactor contained an array of nine single wavelength or a combination of 5 and 4 uv leds each connected in series and fixed in a board a magnetic stirrer power source and a microbial sample in a petri dish fig 1b irradiance was measured at the same water surface level using il 1700 radiometer with sed 270 detector international light usa an equivalent irradiance of around 0 384 mw cm2 was used in all the uv leds to achieve this current voltage was varied using one keithley power source fig s1 for single wavelength and for two wavelength combinations two keithley power sources fig s2 were used the fluence was a product of irradiance and exposure time t s bolton and linden 2003 2 3 uv irradiations all the uv irradiation were conducted inside a clean chamber with a fan that maintain the chamber temperature at 25 4 c fig s3 at the same time the fan helped to maintain the temperature of the powered uv leds at a temperature of 31 4 c fig s4 which was within the manufacturer s requirement 2 3 1 inactivation experiments before uv irradiation 20 ml of microbial suspension was obtained from the suspended bacteria cells in the sterilized saline solution at a concentration of approximately 10 6 cfu ml 5 ml was taken away for bacterial count and the rest 15 ml was placed in a petri dish with 60 mm diameter 6 mm water depth for irradiation for the uv leds to reach stable emission stage they were powered on for 5 min before irradiation while being stirred with a sterile magnetic stir bar the microbial suspension was irradiated at 2 2 cm from the uv led source for changing the different samples the uv leds were powered off for less than 30 s which did not have a significant effect on the irradiance uv irradiation was done for all single and combined wavelengths in this study samples were taken followed by steps of serial dilution plating incubation and enumeration 2 3 2 reactivation experiments to investigate if the 275 nm has a repressive effect on microorganisms reactivation after uv irradiation the irradiation was done using the 267 275 267 275 and the 275 310 nm uv leds at a fluence that led to 3 0 and 4 0 log inactivation same as in section 2 3 1 before uv irradiation 20 ml of microbial suspension was prepared 5 ml taken away for bacterial count and the rest 15 ml was placed in a petri dish for irradiation immediately after irradiation 5 ml of the bacterial sample was transferred into 5 ml glass tube for bacterial count and the rest was used to perform reactivation process the reactivations were conducted at controlled room temperature since any change in temperature affects reactivation salcedo et al 2007 fluorescent lamp 15 w philips with a peak emission at 395 nm was placed at a distance of 30 cm from the samples the reactivation period was 9 h and bacteria samples were collected at interval of 1 5 h dark repair was carried out in a dark box for the same time period and temperature as the samples exposed to the light each reactivation experiment was conducted three times and both un irradiated samples n0 samples immediately after irradiation n and after reactivation nt were taken followed by steps of serial dilution plating incubation and enumeration 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 inactivation kinetics the fluence inactivation response curve of some microorganisms including e coli has been observed to have a shoulder at low fluence a log linear phase at increasing fluence and a tailing phase at high fluence webb and brown 1976 severin et al 1983 mossel et al 1995 cerf 1997 rattanakul and oguma 2018 in this study therefore we used the shoulder model which does not consider the tailing phase eq 1 hijnen et al 2006 1 l o g n 0 n k f l u e n c e b where n 0 and n is the number of colony cfu ml before and immediately after uv irradiation b is the y intercept a negative value since the curve is crossing the fluence axis at the uv fluence where log linear relationship starts offset 2 4 2 reactivation kinetics 2 4 2 1 quantitative evaluation of reactivation to evaluate the effect of reactivation the percentage of reactivation either due to photoreactivation or dark repair was quantified using eq 2 lindenauer and darby 1994 2 percentage of reactivation n t n n 0 n 100 where n0 is the cell number before uv irradiation cfu ml n is the immediate cell number after uv irradiation cfu ml nt is the cell number after reactivation for a period of time t cfu ml in addition the reactivation can be expressed as a function of the survival ratio eq 3 in respect of the initial microorganism concentration before the inactivation process kashimada et al 1996 3 s n t n 0 100 where s is the survival ratio at time t n0 and nt have the same meaning as above 2 4 2 2 modelling photoreactivation a non linear regression model was used to model photoreactivation eq 4 nebot sanz et al 2007 salcedo et al 2007 4 s s m 1 s m s 0 1 e k 2 s m t where sm is the maximum limit of the microorganisms survival by reactivation and s0 is the survival ratio immediately after uv irradiation k2 is the growth second order reactivation rate constant note that k2 is not a pure reactivation rate constant it is rather a model parameter that is adjusted to predict the experimental data whose physical meaning is related to the time required to reach sm and then the stabilization phase nebot sanz et al 2007 salcedo et al 2007 therefore a pure reactivation rate constant k eq 5 can be obtained from the derivatives of eq 4 and its maximum value eq 6 is obtained when s reaches half of sm li et al 2017 5 k ds dt k 2 s m s s 6 k max k 2 s

s m s 0 1 e k 2 s m t m t where m is the mortality a zero order decay rate constant while the other parameters have the same meaning as in eq 4 note that sm k2 kr and m in eqs 4 and 5 have a clear physical significance 2 5 synergy of inactivation synergistic effect of combined wavelengths on microorganism inactivation was compared from the results of log inactivation by combined uv leds and the results from the sum of log inactivation by individual uv leds therefore the synergy values can be calculated using eq 8 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 8 s y n e r g y l o g u n i t s l o g i n a c

of the water in the petri dish the values of wf are shown in table 1 note that the decadic absorption coefficient absorbance for a 1 cm path length for the single wavelengths was determined using a 1 cm diameter quartz cuvette and uv 1780 uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan the cuvette was filled with sterilized saline water solution that was used as a medium in the disinfection experiments and inserted in the uv vis spectrophotometer the absorbance values measurement for the combined wavelengths the absorbance was approximated as the average of the absorbance values of the respective combined wavelengths values of decadic absorption coefficient of different wavelengths are shown in are shown in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli inactivation by uv leds inactivation profile of e coli by different uv led wavelengths is shown in fig 2 a shoulder and tailing were observed in this study the shoulder could have been due to fluence dependent repair process and the threshold value represents the number of sites of an organism that must be destroyed before inactivation occurs webb and brown 1976 severin et al 1983 mossel et al 1995 tailing on the other hand may have resulted from individuals in a population cultured from a pure colony that was not identical with respect to disinfection or due to aggregation of microbial suspension that occurs during treatment cerf 1997 inactivation rate was obtained from log linear part on fluence response curve the 267 nm uv led had a higher log inactivation than the other wavelengths followed by the 267 275 275 nm uv led and the 310 nm uv led was the least fig 2 in addition the 267 nm uv led had a higher k value of 0 42 fig 3 which is similar to the reported value of 0 43 and 0 41 respectively in refs oguma et al 2013 li et al 2017 the k value at 275 nm uv led was 0 292 which was lower than 0 422 reported in ref bowker et al 2011 this may be due to different experimental set up and use of different e coli strain however k value of 0 292 at 275 nm in this work was similar that of 0 29 and 0 30 both at 280 nm in ref oguma et al s work 2013 and li et al 2017 respectively this is reasonable because the 275 nm is close to 280 nm note that for the 267 275 nm uv led combined k 0 391 was greater than k 0 292 for the 275 nm uv led this could have been caused by the higher germicidal effect at 267 nm in the combined wavelength which is the relative peak of bactericidal effectiveness as earlier reported in literature gates 1930 the k values of the other single and combined wavelengths were the lowest and any combination having the 267 nm uv led its k value slightly increased showing that the 267 nm uv led had an influence on inactivation efficiency of the combined uv leds though the k values were not used earlier green et al 2018 the inactivation efficacy and performance of uv leds emitting at 259 268 275 289 and 370 nm were effectively compared against a low pressure mercury lamp at 253 7 nm for e coli listeria and salmonella pathogens using log count reduction lcr at an equivalent uv dose 7 mj cm 2 the uv leds emitting at 259 and 268 nm achieved the highest lcr out of the tested wavelengths which is in agreement with our results in the case of the 267 nm in our work the fluence required to attain above 3 0 log and 4 0 log inactivation was 8 78 10 09 12 26 mj c m 2 and 11 52 15 35 and 23 04 mj c m 2 respectively for the 267 267 275 275 nm respectively while for the other uv leds they required a relatively higher fluence at the same log inactivation this finding is in agreement with the previous studies chatterley and linden 2010 bowker et al 2011 chevremont et al 2012a oguma et al 2013 beck et al 2017 rattanakul and oguma 2018 li et al 2017 compared to the other uv leds the 267 nm uv led required a lower fluence of 8 78 mj c m 2 to attain above 3 0 log inactivation for e coli 3 2 photoreactivation the photoreactivation percentages from the samples irradiated by the 275 nm uv led was statistically lower p 0 005 than the other uv leds in this study in both the 3 0 log and 4 0 log inactivation fig 4 note that the irradiation by the 267 nm uv led had a higher inactivation efficiency than the 310 275 and 267 257 nm uv leds irradiation however the photoreactivation percentages after the 310 275 and 267 275 nm uv leds irradiation were statistically lower p 0 05 than those for the 267 nm uv leds irradiation fig 4 this observation can be attributed to the presence of 275 nm in the 310 275 nm combination which helped to lower photoreactivation percentages this finding is in agreement with previous study which reported that e coli photoreactivation was significantly repressed at 280 nm which is also close to 275 nm in our study li et al 2017 in another previous study adenovirus was effectively inactivated by the 285 nm uv led irradiation and the effective inactivation was attributed to proteins damage oguma et al 2016 the mechanism of inactivation by the mp uv lamp which is capable of repressing e coli reactivation after uv irradiation may partly be attributed to damage to proteins which show absorption maximum between 275 and 280 nm schmid 2001 by considering photoreactivation the log inactivation decreased drastically as photoreactivation time increased the decrease was lower for the 275 nm uv led leading to significantly higher log inactivation p 0 005 than the 267 267 275 and 275 310 nm uv leds in both 3 0 log and 4 0 log inactivation fig 5 a and b therefore the repressive effect observed at 275 nm in this study may be attributed to protein damage which is irreparable by the dna repair mechanisms the lower percentage of photoreactivation in both the uv leds at a higher fluence 4 0 log inactivation fig 4b as compared to lower fluence 3 0 log inactivation fig 4a explains also the need of increasing fluence on minimizing photoreactivation which is in agreement with previous research studies lindenauer and darby 1994 nebot sanz et al 2007 the model described in eq 4 was applied to the photoreactivation experimental data using non linear regression a good fit of the model to the photoreactivation experimental data was observed fig 6 the asymptotic shape of the curves was obtained which were consistent with a typical inactivation reactivation curve nebot sanz et al 2007 salcedo et al 2007 table 2 gives the values of the estimated kinetic parameters s m and k 2 both s m and k 2 showed a consistent behavior with the fluence that led to 3 0 log and 4 0 log inactivation s m showed a negative exponential tendency with the fluence which indicates that high fluence 4 0 log inactivation produce severe damage on bacteria making their reactivation low while low fluence 3 0 log inactivation allows the photoreactivation to take place on the other hand k 2 showed an inverse tendency in which it increased with the fluence however the increase in k 2 with the fluence is due to k 2 is not a pure reactivation rate constant as earlier explained and therefore k m a x eq 6 was used to interpret the rate of reactivation as in the case of s m k m a x also showed a negative exponential tendency with the fluence indicating that high fluence reduces k m a x the 275 nm uv led had the lowest s m and k r m a x as compared to the 267 267 275 and 275 130 nm uv leds in both the 3 0 and 4 0 log inactivation table 2 note that the low s m and k m a x indicates an extended induction phase and a short exponential phase fig 6 and therefore the 275 nm uv led could reduce both the s m and k m a x which means that photoreactivation can be inhibited by uv leds at 275 nm 3 3 dark repair the lowest dark repair percentages were found in the irradiation by the 275 nm uv led than the 265 275 310 and 265 275 nm uv leds in both the 3 0 log and 4 0 log inactivation the negative values of the dark repair percentages indicates a decay phase where the colony count was below the initial count immediately before the dark conditions fig 7 although the dark repair percentages below 0 02 were much lower than photoreactivation percentages above 0 13 any bacteria survival can cause harmful effect to human being the low dark repair percentages led to insignificant differences in log inactivation in both the 3 0 and the 4 0 log inactivation fig 8 both reactivation and a decay phase occurred in dark repair which was not the case in photoreactivation for a period of 9 h the dark repair survival curves showed a low and short reactivation period followed by a dominating decay phase a good fit of the model eq 7 to the dark repair experimental data was obtained fig 9 a and b this finding was in agreement with the previous studies in refs nebot sanz et al 2007 salcedo et al 2007 however there was disagreement in the reports of the recent study where only reactivation was reported during the dark repair li et al 2017 according to our results we think that the slow reactivation and keeping the bacteria sample in absence of any source of food or light can lead to a decay phase the values of the dark repair kinetic parameters s m k 2 k m a x were determined as earlier explained and m mortality rate constant was calculated experimentally from the slope of the linear end of the survival curves between the 4 5 h and the final 9 h the s m and k m a x values for the 275 nm uv led were lower than those for the 265 275 310 and 265 275 nm uv leds in addition the s m and k m a x values decreased with the increase in fluence which was a similar observation in photoreactivation table 3 however the decrease of sm and kmax in the dark repair was small of the order 10 1 and 10 2 as compared to that in photoreactivation of the order 10 1 and 10 0 respectively this is an indication of a low and short reactivation in dark repair the parameter m seems to be independent on both fluence and wavelength with average values between 1 2 10 3 2 8 10 3 survival h in addition there is no significant change of m when either wavelength of fluence changes on the other hand the m values are very small because during the 4 5 h of reactivation a maximum survival of microorganisms of approximately 0 121 and 0 019 for the 3 0 and 4 0 log inactivation respectively will be produced the mortality rate may be attributed to the residual effect of a radiation on the bacterial dna and therefore will be independent on fluence and wavelength as observed in this study the residual effect of radiation on the bacterial dna occurs due to biochemical mechanism of actuation which needs some time to be manifested completely hence it is also possible that the mortality does not occur in photoreactivation experiments because in this situation the repair of damaged dna is more effective nebot sanz et al 2007 this explanation of possibility of absence of mortality in photoreactivation is in agreement with our finding therefore though reactivation occurred after microorganisms uv irradiation the occurrence was lesser in dark repair demonstrating that photo effect is the dominant mechanism of reactivation therefore our results demonstrated that the 275 nm uv led showed better persistence against reactivation than the 265 275 310 and 265 275 nm uv leds which is may be attributable to protein damage at 275 nm 3 4 effect of combining different wavelengths synergistic effect of 267 275 267 310 and 275 310 nm uv led combinations was investigated from observation the sum of log inactivation by individual uv leds that were weighted by their respective average irradiance percentages is equal to the log inactivation from those wavelengths combined fig 10 the same observation was confirmed by using an independent two tailed paired t test i e the difference between the sum of the log inactivation proportions from individual uv leds and the log inactivation from those wavelengths combined was not statistically significant p 0 05 this work indicates that there is no synergistic effect from 267 275 267 310 and 275 310 nm uv leds combinations in inactivating e coli our finding is in agreement with previous studies oguma et al 2013 beck et al 2017 li et al 2017 and also agreed with the second law of photochemistry stark einstein law which states that for each photon of light absorbed by a chemical system only one molecule is activated for subsequent reaction in other words any photochemical effects of different wavelengths on a molecule should be independent of each other achieving only as such inactivation as the sum of the photonic response from the individual wavelengths emitting separately however our study disagreed with other previous reports on presence of synergistic effect in green et al s study 2018 it was argued that synergistic effect following uv treatment at 259 289 nm was as a result of alternative inactivation mechanisms at 289 nm leading to a hurdle effect this may not be true because 289 nm is within the uvb uvc wavelengths whose mechanism of microorganism inactivation is similar ravanat et al 2001 sinha and häder 2002 cadet et al 2005 friedberg et al 2006 on the other hand the synergistic effect was reported on uvc and uva combination chevremont et al 2012a nakahashi et al 2014 in this case we think that the synergistic effect may exist because the mechanism of inactivation at uva 320 400 nm is believed to be different from that at uvc or uvb irradiation by uva wavelengths is believed to cause lethal and mutagenic damage to an organism and in low doses it induces many physiological alterations mainly the well known radioinduced growth inhibition as reported in literature favre et al 1985 eisenstark 1989 therefore more research should be performed at uva uvc with different microorganisms to confirm these previous reports 3 5 electrical energy efficiency in any research involving pathogen inactivation it is necessary to determine the electrical energy efficiency ee n of any uv source used in our study the 267 275 310 267 275 267 310 and 267 310 nm uv leds were used the ee 1 and ee 2 were calculated using eq 9 the 275 nm uv led required lower electrical energy of 0 1367 and 0 2219 kwh m3 for ee 1 and ee 2 respectively in inactivation of e coli as compared to ee 1 and ee 2 by the other uv leds fig 11 the lower ee n of the 275 nm uv led can be attributable to the higher wall plug efficiency of 0 021 compared to that of other uv leds the 310 nm uv led in this study had higher ee 1 of 1 7576 kwh m3 this is because the germicidal effect is low at this wavelength as earlier explained and the wall plug efficiency of 0 011 could not have helped to lower its ee 1 however compared to the 310 nm uv led alone a combination with 267 or 275 nm uv leds led to lower ee 1 this is because the higher germicidal effect at the 267 and 275 nm helped in the lowering the ee n in the combined wavelengths hence suggesting that the 310 nm uv led only is not good but a combination with other leds is much better in lowering ee n the results of our work agreed with previous study in ref beck et al 2017 where it was reported that the electrical energy per order ee 0 of 0 347 kwh m3 by the 280 nm uv led was slightly lower than 0 464 and 0 379 kwh m3 by the 260 and 260 280 nm uv leds respectively this is because the wall plug efficiency of 0 005 by the 280 nm uv led was slightly higher than the wall plug efficiency of 0 004 and 0 00444 by the 260 nm and 260 280 nm uv leds our study also agreed with another previous study in which the 280 nm uv leds required lower ee 3 of 0 17 as compared to 0 41 and 1 22 kwh m3 by the 265 and 300 nm uv leds respectively rattanakul and oguma 2018 this is because the 280 nm uv led had a higher wall plug efficiency of 0 019 as compared to 0 006 for the 265 nm uv led the wall plug efficiency of 0 026 for the 300 nm uv led lowered its ee n but not as much as the 275 nm uv led which is attributable to the lower germicidal effect of microorganisms at 310 nm as earlier explained our work has also shown that not only does the electrical energy efficiency depend on the wall plug efficiency but also on the vulnerability of microorganism at a given wavelength which determines the fluence fn required to inactivate it as represented in eq 9 4 conclusions different uv leds were used to study the inactivation of e coli in a batch water disinfection system the 267 nm uv led had the highest inactivation efficiency than other uv leds for the reactivation after irradiation it was found that the dark repair was lower than photoreactivation demonstrating that photo effect is the dominant mechanism of reactivation in dark repair the decay phase was more prominent than reactivation however irradiation by the 275 nm uv led showed better persistence against reactivation this was attributable to the higher possibility of damage to proteins at 275 nm no synergistic effect for combined wavelengths was observed the electrical energy consumption for the 275 nm uv led was lower than the other uv leds in this study which is attributable to its higher wall plug efficiency compared with 310 nm only however a combination with 267 or 275 nm can significantly lower its electrical energy consumption by considering repression of microorganisms reactivation after uv irradiation and lower electrical energy consumption due to improved wall plug efficiency the 275 nm uv led is concluded to be a better and a promising option in water disinfection note that the electrical energy calculated only reflects the effect of specific wavelengths on specific microbe used in this work in addition the water used in this study did not contain any organic matter which may change the response therefore detailed studies will be necessary with water containing organic matter e g surface or lake water and highly resistant pathogens to elucidate the practical application to tap and waste water treatment in both
