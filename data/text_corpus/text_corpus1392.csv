analysis between the new indicator common indicators and surface runoff are conducted and a significantly correlation between rli and surface runoff is determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study is conducted in the haihe river basin which is located in the northeastern area of the north china plain fig 1 the basin covers an area of 320 000 km2 and it is located within a warm semiarid monsoon climate zone with a mean annual temperature of 1 5 14 c and a mean annual precipitation of 539 mm many large cities such as beijing and tianjin are within the basin and have high density populations and high levels of economic development owing to rapid economic development and population growth the over exploitation of water resources and ecological and environmental degradation other secondary problems have occurred and have become increasingly prominent in the basin therefore the haihe river basin has become a watershed that suffers from intensive interference from human activities these activities have affected the landscape patterns and runoff processes and the basin has significantly changed from its natural state 2 2 water resource regions as units in the investigation of the impact of landscape structure and pattern on surface runoff selecting the geographic unit for the statistics and analysis of hydrologic elements and landscape metrics is of utmost importance it is well known that the watershed is the basic land unit of the hydrologic cycle and the administrative region is the unit for land planning and water management water resource regionalization is conducted to satisfy the demand for unified planning rational development and the scientific management of water resources as a combination of watersheds and administrative regions water resource regions are recognized as functional areas that integrate topography natural climate environmental processes and water exploitation according to water resource regionalization the mainland of china is divided into 10 water resource regions with 80 second level regions and 214 third level regions the haihe river basin is one of the ten regions and 4 second level regions and 15 third level regions lie within this basin because third level water resource regions include the most comprehensive landscape types these regions are selected as research units the 15 units are numbered as shown in fig 1 2 3 data sources and description 2 3 1 runoff data runoff data are collected and processed at the unit scale the natural annual runoff of each unit available at yearly intervals from 1956 to 2000 is derived by the fractional reduction method from the measured runoff according to the regulation for hydrologic computation of water resources and hydropower projects sl278 2002 the formula for calculating the natural annual runoff is illustrated as follows 1 w n w m w a w i w d w t w f w r where wn is the natural annual runoff wm is the measured annual runoff of hydrological stations wa is the agricultural water consumption wi is the industrial water consumption wd is the domestic water consumption wt is the water transferred across regions with a positive value when the water is transferred out and a negative value otherwise wf is the discharge of the flood breach with a positive when the flood is transferred out and a negative value otherwise and wr is the reservoir storage with a positive value when the storage increases and a negative value otherwise 2 3 2 spatial data to compensate for the deficiencies of conventional landscape indices in explaining linkages with surface runoff processes the new landscape index in this study will be constructed with land use terrain and soil properties by collecting data on landcover slope and soil respectively the haihe river basin is divided into 12 landcover classes lcc provided by the institute of remote sensing and digital earth chinese academy of sciences table 1 a dem with a grid resolution of 30 m 30 m is provided by the geospatial data cloud site computer network information center chinese academy of sciences the slope data are extracted from the dem using the slope and aspect function of spatial analyst module in arcgis the soil data including a soil type map 1 1 000 000 scale and related soil properties are derived from the harmonized world soil database hwsd provided by the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences isscas 2 4 construction of rli 2 4 1 determination of the parameters of landscape factors influencing runoff 2 4 1 1 land cover factor λc the effects of vegetation types and land use types are included when estimating the impact of land cover on runoff there are differences in canopy interception among different types of vegetation which could significantly affect runoff generation depending upon species canopy density and crown diameter kim et al 2014 li and pan 2018 besides canopy interception the retention caused by infrastructures such as houses roads ridge and canals should also be included the value of land cover factor λc ranging from 0 to 1 can be assigned according to the contribution of the land cover type to runoff and confluence in this study λc of each land cover is assigned a value by referring to existing research results and revised according to reality and the empirical weight method livesley et al 2014 zhou 2014 li and pan 2018 zheng et al 2018 detailed steps of assignment and revision are described as follows 1 find the rainfall interception range of various types of land cover from the literatures 2 determine the vegetation types and characters of land covers in the haihe river basin 3 compare the features of vegetation and land cover 4 assign the landcover factor values based on the similar features following the steps above interception loss by different land covers has been widely observed and evaluated and the results are shown in table 2 taking forestland as an example firstly interception loss ranges from 14 to 23 of the precipitation ghimire et al 2012 fan et al 2014 shinohara et al 2015 secondly pine and cypresses are determined as the major species in the haihe river basin according to bai et al 2011 thirdly the forest species are mostly the same as those in literatures so the median value of 0 8 is assigned the same steps are repeated for other land cover types specifically with very small vegetation coverage there is low canopy interception loss by bare lands however the bare lands are mostly distributed around the cities in the study area so the retention effect should also be included considering the impacts of both aspects the landcover factor of bare land is assigned value of 0 8 which is the same as the initial state of forestland in 1980 2 4 1 2 soil factor λk soil permeability is one of the important factors affecting surface runoff while the permeability varies with soil texture lazzarotto et al 2006 the soil factor λk represented the contribution of the soil type to runoff is estimated by soil drainage classes which represent reference drainage conditions assuming flat terrain the drainage classes in the haihe river basin is extracted from hwsd in its attribute database the soil drainage is graded into seven classes very poor poor imperfectly moderately well well somewhat excessive to excessive for different types of soil lower drainage class represent a higher impermeability so the drainage classes can be assigned according to the impermeable areas percentage specifically for the very poor grade of drainage we assign it as 90 of impermeable areas percentage similarly we assign the excessive grade as 30 table 3 long term relationships between runoff coefficient and impervious area are generalized by goldshleger et al 2009 when the impermeable area ratio varies from 30 to 90 the runoff coefficient increases linearly from 0 2 to 0 8 as shown in table 3 as for the haihe river basin there are six grades excluding excessive based on its soil type the soil factor is assigned values from 0 8 to 0 3 in term of table 3 the distribution of soil factors in the haihe river basin is shown in fig 2 2 4 1 3 topographic factor λs slope is an important factor affecting the production of surface runoff ekwue and harrilal 2010 at the micro level the overland runoff is related to the hillslope gradient huang et al 2013 investigations on experimental runoff plots have shown that steep slope plots yield more runoff than those with gentle slopes sharma 1986 the relationship between flow velocity and hillslope gradient has been studied and the results indicated that the hillslope gradient has a positive effect on runoff velocity with a maximum velocity on a 35 slope shao 2001 ekwue and harrilal 2010 therefore the slope coefficient 1 cosα is introduced as the terrain factor the gradient is graded into seven classes below the maximum slope and divided into 5 intervals the distribution of topographical factors in the haihe river basin is shown in fig 3 2 4 2 index derivation after parameter determination and quantitative assignment of landscape factors influencing runoff indices can be derived and aggregated using the raster calculator in arcgis grain or grid cell is the finest spatial or temporal unit in a data set within which homogeneity is assumed the landscape factors that affect surface runoff are considered at the grain scale because the overflow in a raster cell is the basis of watershed confluence the runoff landscape indicators are measured at the patch scale the patch type scale and the landscape scale the aggregation of the landscape factors for all the grid cells in a patch is defined as the runoff landscape factor p expressed as follows 2 p i 1 n λ ci λ ki λ si n where λci is the landcover factor in grid i of the patch λki is the soil factor in grid i of the patch and λsi is the topographic factor in grid i of the patch the runoff landscape index rli is the summation of the runoff landscape factors across the area and the expressions of rli at the patch type scale and the landscape scale are shown in eqs 3 and 4 3 rli i 1 k p i a i a where pi is the runoff landscape factor of patch i ai is the area of patch i a is the area of the corresponding landscape classification 4 rli i 1 m j 1 k p ij a ij a where pij is the runoff landscape factor of patch ij aij is the area of patch ij a is the total area of the landscape 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution and variation trends of rli fig 4 shows the landcover changes in the haihe river basin from 1980 to 2010 in the figure flat dryland occupies the largest proportion of the landscape area in the haihe river basin accounting for 41 20 of the total basin area flat dryland is followed by forests grasslands shrubs and sloping fields which account for 80 of the total area of the basin the area of urban land increased the most increasing by 147 32 from 1980 to 2010 the landscape pattern of the haihe river basin experienced a gradual increase of patch density with separation increasing and spread decreasing these results show that the spatial heterogeneity of the landscape is increasing under the influence of human activities and the landscape pattern tends to be fragmented discretized and diversified the spatial distribution of rli in the haihe river basin from 1980 to 2010 is shown in fig 5 ranging from 0 096 to 0 976 the value of rli represents the contribution of landscape factors to surface runoff larger values represent more surface runoff produced under the same precipitation conditions as shown in fig 5 rli exhibits significant spatial differences in the haihe river basin with high values of rli distributed in the taihang mountain areas and low rli values in the north china plain areas regarding the impact of the landscape on surface runoff the main landcover of the steep mountainous areas is forest which is conducive to production of surface runoff the main landcover in the north china plain is flat farmland with a slope below 5 and most of the precipitation is infiltrated to the groundwater resulting in less surface runoff the rlis counted by the third level water resource regions are shown in fig 6 rlis of water resource regions in mountainous areas such as the luan river mountain the north three rivers mountain the daqing river mountain the ziya river mountain and the zhangwei river mountain are higher than the rlis in plain areas which is consistent with the distribution of the surface runoff this result indicates that the runoff capacity of mountainous areas is greater than that of the plain areas meanwhile rlis show a slight decreasing trend that is synchronous with the variation in runoff the change in the land surface caused by human activities is the main reason for the decrease of river runoff han et al 2009 3 2 temporal and spatial trends of surface runoff runoff depth and runoff coefficient are commonly used to indicate the surface runoff in hydrology wang et al 2009 in this paper these two indices are chosen as the main surface runoff indicators for trend analysis the 5 year moving average method is used to investigate the variation of surface runoff indicators from 1956 to 2000 in the haihe river basin fig 7 both runoff depth and runoff coefficient are decreasing and experiencing large interannual fluctuations in the 45 years the runoff depth has been decreasing at a rate about 0 98 mm yr indicating statistically significant negative trends through the runoff reduction and consistency correction the average runoff depth from 1980 to 2000 is 53 28 mm which has a 33 4 decrease from 79 97 mm in the period from 1956 to 1979 runoff coefficient which is viewed as a diagnostic variable of runoff generation and as an important link between rainfall and runoff its variations are results of changes in control conditions merz et al 2006 it has been decreasing at a rate of 0 01 per decade suggesting a change of rainfall runoff relationship in haihe river basin the spatiotemporal variation of surface runoff indicators in the third level water resource regions are analyzed from year 1956 to 2000 fig 8 there are obvious zonal differences in runoff depth and the runoff coefficient among the third level water resource regions the general spatial distribution is a decreasing trend from the taihang mountains to the northwest and southeast the runoff series illustrates a significant reduction in all the water resource regions since 1956 the event runoff coefficient varies in space and time while the climate and catchment formation determine the spatial variability and event characteristics such as antecedent soil moisture content and rainfall depth determine the time variability merz and blöschl 2009 research reported that overall runoff coefficient has strong relationship with peak flow and this relationship varies from year to year with different types of land cover sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 the research also find that the coefficient increases with the increasing forest proportion and decreases with the increasing of agricultural and disturbed forest areas sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 in haihe river basin overall runoff coefficients show a significant spatial variability with large coefficient in mountainous regions no 1 3 7 10 12 and small in plain regions this result also verifies the conclusion of sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 because the forests are concentrated in regions 1 3 7 10 12 and the main land cover in other regions are cultivated lands 3 3 correlation between rli and surface runoff regression analysis between rli and surface runoff indicators are conducted at water resource regions scale fig 9 the fifteen water resource regions are set apart to test the landscape approach for the ability of representing the corresponding runoff depth and runoff coefficient considering the spatial differences ten regions of them are used for regression line fitting and five regions which representing different ranges of rli values are used for validation the results indicate high correlation between rli and surface runoff at spatial scale with values of r square up to 0 88 and 0 91 the root mean square error rmse is used to evaluate the verification performance and the values are 0 005 and 0 018 respectively the validation of the correlations indicates that the rli could be applied to ungauged basins for runoff derivation and prediction the results of the pearson correlation analyses between rli and the surface runoff indicators are shown as table 4 significant positive relationship between rli and surface runoff at time and spatial scale are indicated in addition the correlation between rli and the runoff coefficient is stronger than that with the runoff depth used as a diagnostic variable for runoff generation the runoff coefficient can better characterize the impact of natural geographical factors on runoff in the basin because spatial variability caused by soil and landcover are considered similarly the runoff landscape index rli constructed in this study is a combination of factors such as land cover soil and topography measuring its impact on surface runoff 4 discussion 4 1 comparison to traditional landscape indices using landscape metrics to estimate the impact of landcover on environmental and ecological system such as water quality and wetlands has been a popular method miller et al 2016 xu and zhang 2016 however these approaches are developed based on commonly used landscape indicators in this paper a new indicator is developed to investigate the effects of land use patterns on surface runoff meanwhile correlation of eleven landscape indicators with runoff depth in haihe river basin is also analyzed as shown in table 5 these indicators represent landscape features from different perspectives such as configuration fragmentation and diversity leemans 2013 the analysis results indicate that the surface runoff depth is correlated with landscape metrics but the r values are lower than the rli s and partly pass the significant testing compared to the normally used indicators rli has stronger relationships showing significant positive correlations with the runoff depth the comparison analysis results further validate that the new landscape index is possible and effective 4 2 simplification of the runoff constituents the entire physical process from the beginning of rainfall to the flowing out of the watershed outlet is defined as the rainfall runoff process when rain falls the first drops of water are intercepted by the leaves and stems of the vegetation which is usually referred to as interception storage as the rain continues water reaching the ground surface partly infiltrates into the soil and other partly forms surface runoff thence the rainfall runoff processes are divided into interception infiltration and surface runoff in this study based on this simplification of runoff component interception effect is estimated by the landcover factors and infiltration is affected by soil and topographical factors therefore the assignment of influence factors and index derivation of rli are mainly based on the rainfall runoff process simplification with factors assigned independently and multiplied finally the rainfall characteristics such as intensity duration and distribution are considered to have significant influence on the flood event apart from rainfall characteristics there are many catchment specific factors which have a direct bearing on the occurrence and volume of runoff such as land cover soil and slope podwojewski et al 2008 jencso and mcglynn 2011 all of these factors lead to differences in the spatial and temporal variations of runoff spatial variation characteristics are reflected in catchment specific factors the temporal factors seasonality water accumulation effects are less considered in this paper because they have significant impact on event floods but little effect on long term rainfall runoff characteristics this article focuses on the long term effects of landscape factors on decade scale in future research synergistic effect of the rainfall characteristics and catchment specific factors on event flood runoff will be finely studied 4 3 water resources management using rli in recent years the application of remote sensing rs and geographical information system gis technology in natural resource monitoring and environmental management has been strongly advocated thakkar et al 2017 he et al 2018 benefitting from the full development of rs and gis technology investigating the changes in catchment landscape factors such as land cover soils and topography has been easy practice the fact that catchment landscape factors have impact on surface runoff has been confirmed the rli developed in this paper quantifies this effect and establishes the function relationship between them therefore the construction of rli is a positive step forward in promoting remote sensing technologies for water resources management the real time comprehensiveness of landscape monitoring and the accessibility of geospatial data provided the favorable basis for the calculation of the indicator moreover rli can be directly applied to water resources analysis and forecasting with the changes in surface runoff quickly inferred through index variations so it can provide an effective tool and useful ideas to land planers and river basin managers since the index is established at a large watershed and decade scale the rli is suitable for long term water resources planning and management further researches that developing finer ecological or landscape indicators could expand on our results and a better explanation of the complex relationship between landscape and runoff can be clarified 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the effect of landcover soil and slope on surface runoff using a landscape approach a new landscape indicator rli multiplied by the three landscape factors is developed in the haihe river basin the indicator is a holistic integration of metrics that represent the influence of landscape components on the surface runoff and it relates landscape metrics to hydrological processes among all the catchment landscape factors landcover is the most important factor affecting runoff then followed by soil permeability for the haihe river basin there is obvious regional differentiation of rli and annual surface runoff at the water resource regions scale there are significantly positively correlations between rli and surface runoff indicators which validate the rationality and practicability of the new index compared with the commonly used landscape indices rli has stronger correlations with the surface runoff the correlation model of eleven traditional landscape indices and runoff depth has lower r value partly passing the significant testing since the new index is constructed based on the rainfall runoff process the rli has clearer physical mechanisms to reflect the relationship between landscape patterns and hydrological processes to a certain extent in addition rli could be used to efficiently predict annual runoff in ungauged basins even in future land cover scenarios and possibly provide a new perspective for water resource management at the river basin scale the variations of rli also provide guidelines for regional water resources management developing finer indicators to expand our researches and relate landscape and flood event is under study acknowledgments the research was supported by the national natural science

livesley et al 2014 zhou 2014 li and pan 2018 zheng et al 2018 detailed steps of assignment and revision are described as follows 1 find the rainfall interception range of various types of land cover from the literatures 2 determine the vegetation types and characters of land covers in the haihe river basin 3 compare the features of vegetation and land cover 4 assign the landcover factor values based on the similar features following the steps above interception loss by different land covers has been widely observed and evaluated and the results are shown in table 2 taking forestland as an example firstly interception loss ranges from 14 to 23 of the precipitation ghimire et al 2012 fan et al 2014 shinohara et al 2015 secondly pine and cypresses are determined as the major species in the haihe river basin according to bai et al 2011 thirdly the forest species are mostly the same as those in literatures so the median value of 0 8 is assigned the same steps are repeated for other land cover types specifically with very small vegetation coverage there is low canopy interception loss by bare lands however the bare lands are mostly distributed around the cities in the study area so the retention effect should also be included considering the impacts of both aspects the landcover factor of bare land is assigned value of 0 8 which is the same as the initial state of forestland in 1980 2 4 1 2 soil factor λk soil permeability is one of the important factors affecting surface runoff while the permeability varies with soil texture lazzarotto et al 2006 the soil factor λk represented the contribution of the soil type to runoff is estimated by soil drainage classes which represent reference drainage conditions assuming flat terrain the drainage classes in the haihe river basin is extracted from hwsd in its attribute database the soil drainage is graded into seven classes very poor poor imperfectly moderately well well somewhat excessive to excessive for different types of soil lower drainage class represent a higher impermeability so the drainage classes can be assigned according to the impermeable areas percentage specifically for the very poor grade of drainage we assign it as 90 of impermeable areas percentage similarly we assign the excessive grade as 30 table 3 long term relationships between runoff coefficient and impervious area are generalized by goldshleger et al 2009 when the impermeable area ratio varies from 30 to 90 the runoff coefficient increases linearly from 0 2 to 0 8 as shown in table 3 as for the haihe river basin there are six grades excluding excessive based on its soil type the soil factor is assigned values from 0 8 to 0 3 in term of table 3 the distribution of soil factors in the haihe river basin is shown in fig 2 2 4 1 3 topographic factor λs slope is an important factor affecting the production of surface runoff ekwue and harrilal 2010 at the micro level the overland runoff is related to the hillslope gradient huang et al 2013 investigations on experimental runoff plots have shown that steep slope plots yield more runoff than those with gentle slopes sharma 1986 the relationship between flow velocity and hillslope gradient has been studied and the results indicated that the hillslope gradient has a positive effect on runoff velocity with a maximum velocity on a 35 slope shao 2001 ekwue and harrilal 2010 therefore the slope coefficient 1 cosα is introduced as the terrain factor the gradient is graded into seven classes below the maximum slope and divided into 5 intervals the distribution of topographical factors in the haihe river basin is shown in fig 3 2 4 2 index derivation after parameter determination and quantitative assignment of landscape factors influencing runoff indices can be derived and aggregated using the raster calculator in arcgis grain or grid cell is the finest spatial or temporal unit in a data set within which homogeneity is assumed the landscape factors that affect surface runoff are considered at the grain scale because the overflow in a raster cell is the basis of watershed confluence the runoff landscape indicators are measured at the patch scale the patch type scale and the landscape scale the aggregation of the landscape factors for all the grid cells in a patch is defined as the runoff landscape factor p expressed as follows 2 p i 1 n λ ci λ ki λ si n where λci is the landcover factor in grid i of the patch λki is the soil factor in grid i of the patch and λsi is the topographic factor in grid i of the patch the runoff landscape index rli is the summation of the runoff landscape factors across the area and the expressions of rli at the patch type scale and the landscape scale are shown in eqs 3 and 4 3 rli i 1 k p i a i a where pi is the runoff landscape factor of patch i ai is the area of patch i a is the area of the corresponding landscape classification 4 rli i 1 m j 1 k p ij a ij a where pij is the runoff landscape factor of patch ij aij is the area of patch ij a is the total area of the landscape 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution and variation trends of rli fig 4 shows the landcover changes in the haihe river basin from 1980 to 2010 in the figure flat dryland occupies the largest proportion of the landscape area in the haihe river basin accounting for 41 20 of the total basin area flat dryland is followed by forests grasslands shrubs and sloping fields which account for 80 of the total area of the basin the area of urban land increased the most increasing by 147 32 from 1980 to 2010 the landscape pattern of the haihe river basin experienced a gradual increase of patch density with separation increasing and spread decreasing these results show that the spatial heterogeneity of the landscape is increasing under the influence of human activities and the landscape pattern tends to be fragmented discretized and diversified the spatial distribution of rli in the haihe river basin from 1980 to 2010 is shown in fig 5 ranging from 0 096 to 0 976 the value of rli represents the contribution of landscape factors to surface runoff larger values represent more surface runoff produced under the same precipitation conditions as shown in fig 5 rli exhibits significant spatial differences in the haihe river basin with high values of rli distributed in the taihang mountain areas and low rli values in the north china plain areas regarding the impact of the landscape on surface runoff the main landcover of the steep mountainous areas is forest which is conducive to production of surface runoff the main landcover in the north china plain is flat farmland with a slope below 5 and most of the precipitation is infiltrated to the groundwater resulting in less surface runoff the rlis counted by the third level water resource regions are shown in fig 6 rlis of water resource regions in mountainous areas such as the luan river mountain the north three rivers mountain the daqing river mountain the ziya river mountain and the zhangwei river mountain are higher than the rlis in plain areas which is consistent with the distribution of the surface runoff this result indicates that the runoff capacity of mountainous areas is greater than that of the plain areas meanwhile rlis show a slight decreasing trend that is synchronous with the variation in runoff the change in the land surface caused by human activities is the main reason for the decrease of river runoff han et al 2009 3 2 temporal and spatial trends of surface runoff runoff depth and runoff coefficient are commonly used to indicate the surface runoff in hydrology wang et al 2009 in this paper these two indices are chosen as the main surface runoff indicators for trend analysis the 5 year moving average method is used to investigate the variation of surface runoff indicators from 1956 to 2000 in the haihe river basin fig 7 both runoff depth and runoff coefficient are decreasing and experiencing large interannual fluctuations in the 45 years the runoff depth has been decreasing at a rate about 0 98 mm yr indicating statistically significant negative trends through the runoff reduction and consistency correction the average runoff depth from 1980 to 2000 is 53 28 mm which has a 33 4 decrease from 79 97 mm in the period from 1956 to 1979 runoff coefficient which is viewed as a diagnostic variable of runoff generation and as an important link between rainfall and runoff its variations are results of changes in control conditions merz et al 2006 it has been decreasing at a rate of 0 01 per decade suggesting a change of rainfall runoff relationship in haihe river basin the spatiotemporal variation of surface runoff indicators in the third level water resource regions are analyzed from year 1956 to 2000 fig 8 there are obvious zonal differences in runoff depth and the runoff coefficient among the third level water resource regions the general spatial distribution is a decreasing trend from the taihang mountains to the northwest and southeast the runoff series illustrates a significant reduction in all the water resource regions since 1956 the event runoff coefficient varies in space and time while the climate and catchment formation determine the spatial variability and event characteristics such as antecedent soil moisture content and rainfall depth determine the time variability merz and blöschl 2009 research reported that overall runoff coefficient has strong relationship with peak flow and this relationship varies from year to year with different types of land cover sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 the research also find that the coefficient increases with the increasing forest proportion and decreases with the increasing of agricultural and disturbed forest areas sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 in haihe river basin overall runoff coefficients show a significant spatial variability with large coefficient in mountainous regions no 1 3 7 10 12 and small in plain regions this result also verifies the conclusion of sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 because the forests are concentrated in regions 1 3 7 10 12 and the main land cover in other regions are cultivated lands 3 3 correlation between rli and surface runoff regression analysis between rli and surface runoff indicators are conducted at water resource regions scale fig 9 the fifteen water resource regions are set apart to test the landscape approach for the ability of representing the corresponding runoff depth and runoff coefficient considering the spatial differences ten regions of them are used for regression line fitting and five regions which representing different ranges of rli values are used for validation the results indicate high correlation between rli and surface runoff at spatial scale with values of r square up to 0 88 and 0 91 the root mean square error rmse is used to evaluate the verification performance and the values are 0 005 and 0 018 respectively the validation of the correlations indicates that the rli could be applied to ungauged basins for runoff derivation and prediction the results of the pearson correlation analyses between rli and the surface runoff indicators are shown as table 4 significant positive relationship between rli and surface runoff at time and spatial scale are indicated in addition the correlation between rli and the runoff coefficient is stronger than that with the runoff depth used as a diagnostic variable for runoff generation the runoff coefficient can better characterize the impact of natural geographical factors on runoff in the basin because spatial variability caused by soil and landcover are considered similarly the runoff landscape index rli constructed in this study is a combination of factors such as land cover soil and topography measuring its impact on surface runoff 4 discussion 4 1 comparison to traditional landscape indices using landscape metrics to estimate the impact of landcover on environmental and ecological system such as water quality and wetlands has been a popular method miller et al 2016 xu and zhang 2016 however these approaches are developed based on commonly used landscape indicators in this paper a new indicator is developed to investigate the effects of land use patterns on surface runoff meanwhile correlation of eleven landscape indicators with runoff depth in haihe river basin is also analyzed as shown in table 5 these indicators represent landscape features from different perspectives such as configuration fragmentation and diversity leemans 2013 the analysis results indicate that the surface runoff depth is correlated with landscape metrics but the r values are lower than the rli s and partly pass the significant testing compared to the normally used indicators rli has stronger relationships showing significant positive correlations with the runoff depth the comparison analysis results further validate that the new landscape index is possible and effective 4 2 simplification of the runoff constituents the entire physical process from the beginning of rainfall to the flowing out of the watershed outlet is defined as the rainfall runoff process when rain falls the first drops of water are intercepted by the leaves and stems of the vegetation which is usually referred to as interception storage as the rain continues water reaching the ground surface partly infiltrates into the soil and other partly forms surface runoff thence the rainfall runoff processes are divided into interception infiltration and surface runoff in this study based on this simplification of runoff component interception effect is estimated by the landcover factors and infiltration is affected by soil and topographical factors therefore the assignment of influence factors and index derivation of rli are mainly based on the rainfall runoff process simplification with factors assigned independently and multiplied finally the rainfall characteristics such as intensity duration and distribution are considered to have significant influence on the flood event apart from rainfall characteristics there are many catchment specific factors which have a direct bearing on the occurrence and volume of runoff such as land cover soil and slope podwojewski et al 2008 jencso and mcglynn 2011 all of these factors lead to differences in the spatial and temporal variations of runoff spatial variation characteristics are reflected in catchment specific factors the temporal factors seasonality water accumulation effects are less considered in this paper because they have significant impact on event floods but little effect on long term rainfall runoff characteristics this article focuses on the long term effects of landscape factors on decade scale in future research synergistic effect of the rainfall characteristics and catchment specific factors on event flood runoff will be finely studied 4 3 water resources management using rli in recent years the application of remote sensing rs and geographical information system gis technology in natural resource monitoring and environmental management has been strongly advocated thakkar et al 2017 he et al 2018 benefitting from the full development of rs and gis technology investigating the changes in catchment landscape factors such as land cover soils and topography has been easy practice the fact that catchment landscape factors have impact on surface runoff has been confirmed the rli developed in this paper quantifies this effect and establishes the function relationship between them therefore the construction of rli is a positive step forward in promoting remote sensing technologies for water resources management the real time comprehensiveness of landscape monitoring and the accessibility of geospatial data provided the favorable basis for the calculation of the indicator moreover rli can be directly applied to water resources analysis and forecasting with the changes in surface runoff quickly inferred through index variations so it can provide an effective tool and useful ideas to land planers and river basin managers since the index is established at a large watershed and decade scale the rli is suitable for long term water resources planning and management further researches that developing finer ecological or landscape indicators could expand on our results and a better explanation of the complex relationship between landscape and runoff can be clarified 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the effect of landcover soil and slope on surface runoff using a landscape approach a new landscape indicator rli multiplied by the three landscape factors is developed in the haihe river basin the indicator is a holistic integration of metrics that represent the influence of landscape components on the surface runoff and it relates landscape metrics to hydrological processes among all the catchment landscape factors landcover is the most important factor affecting runoff then followed by soil permeability for the haihe river basin there is obvious regional differentiation of rli and annual surface runoff at the water resource regions scale there are significantly positively correlations between rli and surface runoff indicators which validate the rationality and practicability of the new index compared with the commonly used landscape indices rli has stronger correlations with the surface runoff the correlation model of eleven traditional landscape indices and runoff depth has lower r value partly passing the significant testing since the new index is constructed based on the rainfall runoff process the rli has clearer physical mechanisms to reflect the relationship between landscape patterns and hydrological processes to a certain extent in addition rli could be used to efficiently predict annual runoff in ungauged basins even in future land cover scenarios and possibly provide a new perspective for water resource management at the river basin scale the variations of rli also provide guidelines for regional water resources management developing finer indicators to expand our researches and relate landscape and flood event is under study acknowledgments the research was supported by the national natural science

6961,this work presents a methodology for developing a model predictive control mpc for enhancing the operation of urban drainage systems uds the objective of the mpc is to apply a proactive management strategy that uses optimised time state schedules for operating the actuators of uds in real time aiming to mitigate flooding consequences the mpc uses epa swmm hydrologic hydraulic simulation engine and genetic algorithm ga to optimise the time state schedules for the actuators of uds the efficiency of the mpc was tested on the lille university campus resulting in satisfying improvements in the use of storage capacity of retention elements within the uds keywords floods mitigation genetic algorithm model predictive control proactive management strategy urban drainage systems abbreviations mpc model predictive control uds urban drainage system ga genetic algorithm rtm real time monitoring rtc real time control nse nash sutcliffe efficiency narx nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs yrp year return period vss valve state schedule 1 introduction urbanisation processes and climate change are increasing the peak flows and runoff volumes evacuated by drainage infrastructures fan et al 2017 yu et al 2017 in addition the aging of urban drainage systems uds components is leading to different types of structural failures reducing their hydraulic capacities ugarelli and federico 2010 consequently over the past few decades operational shortages have been increasingly occurring in uds resulting in environmental pollution floods and casualties zeleňáková et al 2017 as these have considerable social economic and environmental impacts strengthening uds to be able to limit flooding and pollution events becomes a priority for water engineers abou rjeily et al 2017 hammond et al 2013 as a result many research studies have been dedicated to improving the performance of uds to operate efficiently under climate conditions and volume loadings that exceed their initial designed capacities karl et al 2009 lee et al 2017 milly et al 2008 solomon et al 2007 real time monitoring rtm and control rtc systems have been presented in the literature as a promising solution for increasing the uds capacities abou rjeily et al 2017 ficchì et al 2016 garcía et al 2015 schütze et al 2004 rtm systems involve implementing connected sensors in critical locations within the uds different types of sensors are used to monitor uds operations these can be water level meters flowmeters turbidity meters weather stations etc in addition to their direct contribution in rtc applications sensor measurements help engineers to understand evaluate and improve the operation of the uds rtc is based on dynamically operating the ancillary equipment of uds to efficiently benefit from the entire system capacity schütze et al 2003 rtc was found more appropriate than off line control for managing uds due to the dynamic and stochastic nature of drainage infrastructures and storm events jacobson 2011 multiple classifications of rtc exist they are determined by desired management complexity and objectives rtc classifications are separated into two major types heuristic and optimisation based algorithms heuristic algorithms are solely based on an operator s experience without modelling results optimisation based algorithms aim to optimise the uds operation based on real time measurements and simulation results both of these rtc types could be reactive or predictive systems reactive systems use actual values to operate the uds while predictive systems aim to adjust system operations to meet future conditions and forecasts an extensive review of simulation models and rtc for uds is presented in garcía et al 2015 the main challenge in implementing a predictive rtc with optimisation based algorithms lies in its capacity to consistently find the most convenient actions that should be applied using the actuators of the uds model predictive control mpc has been presented in the literature as an efficient decision support system and has been successfully applied in different fields including the water industry ocampo martinez et al 2013 vermuyten et al 2018 xu 2017 zimmer et al 2018 however some problems remain open in the mpc applications such as adaptation robustness and distributed mpc christofides et al 2013 garcía et al 2015 lee 2011 being predictive and aiming to find the optimal solution is a challenge for an efficient mpc the challenge of running iterative simulations to find the best operational scenario before it is too late was treated in the literature using simplified control oriented models garcía et al 2015 despite their efficiency in reducing the required calculation time and thus allowing the mpc to be predictive control oriented models ignore some hydraulic phenomenon and simplify the results this can lead to an incorrect evaluation of the solutions and consequent robustness problems therefore this paper focuses on developing an mpc that efficiently and consistently evaluates the different operation scenarios for the actuators of the uds and return the optimal operation scenario in a feasible and applicable calculation period the results efficiency and robustness of the developed mpc will be evaluated on a sector of the lille university campus where floods appear annually during severe storm events 2 description of the proactive management strategy the proactive management strategy described in this work is based on an mpc system for computing the optimal time state schedules for the actuators of uds the optimisation will be conducted in advance through iterative calculations that search for the best system performance the mpc conducts the iterative calculations using a hydrologic hydraulic simulation engine fig 1 shows the process for the proactive management strategy application once a severe storm event is forecasted the proactive management strategy updates the initial conditions of the mpc according to the measurements of an implemented real time monitoring system sensor measurements are collected through connecting to a scada system simultaneously weather forecasts such as rainfall intensities radar images and temperatures are introduced as input data to the simulation model this allows optimisation to be conducted in advance finally before running the simulations boundary conditions such as the outfall water depth variation are introduced to the model according to the uds size and characteristics simulations will be conducted for a duration longer than the weather forecast time horizon in order to predict the full response of the uds simulation model run duration since the proactive management strategy is based on forecasted weather the optimisation time horizon is bound by acceptable degrees of confidence in the accuracy of the rainfall forecast over time iterations start once the weather forecast is available and consume time from the optimisation horizon as shown in fig 1 calculation time therefore computation time is critical and should be effectively reduced also reduced computation time allows more frequent restarting of the optimisation for the same storm event this then allows more frequent control system adjustments by updating sensor measurements boundary conditions and weather forecasts the adjustments also serve to reduce the uncertainties of the inputs to the model by replacing the weather forecasts during the hindcast period with measured rainfall intensities once the iterative calculations are conducted the resulted optimal time state schedules are sent as commands to the actuators through an opc connection to a scada system 3 simulation model and optimisation technique the aim of this work is to use a complete hydrologic hydraulic simulation model for the iterative calculations and evaluation of the solutions in order to develop an efficient and robust mpc a complete hydrologic hydraulic model offers more detailed simulations than a control oriented model and presents results for the entire uds operation this choice helps the mpc quantify the total flooding volumes efficiently especially when floods appear on secondary branches and are due to backwater and flow reversal effects using a complete epa swmm model extends the calculation time which is a limitation for the mpc to overcome this limitation improvements were applied to the calculation process of the optimisation technique used in this study due to its success in real life applications its population orientation nature and its efficiency in performing simultaneous global and local searches genetic algorithms ga was selected as the optimisation technique for the mpc ga is suitable for applications with objective functions that are not convex continuous or differentiable this fact generalises its effectiveness for all types of real life applications shi et al 2016 after generating a set of random solutions called initial population ga performs a calculation loop over a number of iterations at each iteration the algorithm calculates the objective function values for all the solutions within a population and ranks them according to their efficiencies better ranked solutions are more likely to be selected to form new solutions for the next iteration by crossover and mutation genetic operations since ga evaluates a population of independent solutions at each iteration the reduction of computation time was based on distributing and parallelising the objective function calculations for all the individuals of a population simultaneously on different servers and computing cores 4 application the stormwater network of a critical sector at the lille university campus was used to implement and evaluate the proposed mpc the total area of the studied sector is 30 ha the stormwater network presented in fig 2 consists of underground pipes with diameters between 150 and 1200 mm a retention tank composed of 4 parallel large diameter pipes with a total volume of 280 m3 is installed on the studied area the objective of this tank is to protect the main collector from being surcharged during severe storm events by storing and slowing the runoff generated from its upstream newly constructed area therefore at its outlet the tank has a static flow regulator to regulate the discharge to 10 l s and a check valve for allocating its retention capacity to the water generated from its upstream area from 1960 onwards the studied sector has seen continuous expansion due to the construction of new buildings and impermeable surfaces since that time floods have appeared annually on this sector during severe storm events fig 2 shows a flooding event that occurred on 31 august 2015 the flooding area is extremely dangerous since it appears in low topographical zones near university buildings a flood depth of 50 cm enables the water to enter the buildings posing a risk to researchers and equipment installed in underground laboratories 4 1 real time monitoring system implementation since hydraulic operation shortages are presented on the campus each year in march 2015 the studied sector was equipped with a monitoring system to understand and evaluate its hydraulic operation fig 3 presents the different types of sensors that were implemented on the studied area a weather station nb1 two flowmeters nb2 and nb3 and two water level meters nb4 and nb5 were used as the quantitative sensors of the monitoring system water quality of the runoff generated from the studied area was evaluated by a turbidity meter nb6 implemented within the uds the monitoring system was initialised to take measurements at a 1 min time step the monitoring system was very efficient in detecting flooding events and presenting the hydraulic operation at the locations of the implemented sensors aiming to understand the entire uds operation and to evaluate the floods origins the monitoring system was combined with a hydrologic hydraulic simulation model 4 2 hydrologic hydraulic simulation model the model was built on the epa swmm software dynamic wave was selected as the routing model to account for backwater effects pressurised flow flow reversal and channel storage the epa swmm model was auto calibrated using ga and pattern search optimisation techniques on 10 different rainfall events an average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value of 0 75 was calculated for the 10 rainfall events that were used in the calibration phase in addition the model was verified on 10 different rainfall events not included in the calibration process resulting in an average nse value of 0 71 fig 4 presents the comparison between measured and modelled flow for an event used in the calibration process 13 09 2015 and an event used for the verification of the model 21 11 2015 respectively 4 3 boundary conditions forecast system since a sector of the uds is modelled in this study the water depth variation in the last modelled manhole outfall of the modelled sector cannot be simulated and should be introduced as boundary conditions for the model outfall water depth variation affects the model simulation results especially when the system is surcharged therefore the boundary conditions are necessary for the epa swmm model in order to simulate the real effect of the un modelled downstream network on the modelled upstream network for monitored events these boundary conditions are measured by the water level meter nb5 in fig 3 for synthetic and forecasted events these boundary conditions should be predicted before running the simulations the outfall water depth variation is a complex hydrologic hydraulic response of the uds to a rainfall event due to its capability of predicting the water level variation in a manhole abou rjeily et al 2017 a nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx was developed and trained to predict the water depth variation at the outfall the efficiency of the narx neural network was evaluated on 10 different rainfall events resulting in a regression value of 0 986 in addition the narx neural network efficiency was tested graphically during a 5 day rainfall event this showed similarities between measured and predicted data as illustrated in fig 5 4 4 analysis of the uds hydraulic operation simulation results of the uds operation applied to the severe storm event of 31 august 2015 which caused floods on the university campus are presented in abou rjeily et al 2016 the results show that flooding appears on secondary branches located in low topographical areas due to backwater and reversal flows generated after the surcharge of the main collector in addition it was noticed that the installed static equipment downstream of the retention tank flow regulator and check valve are disconnecting the branches of the uds and thus limit the operational capacity of the stormwater network the flooding volume generated during this event is 869 m3 due to the stochastic nature of rainfall events the system operation was also studied on a synthetic storm event with a 5 year return period yrp as it provides a good representation of rainfall events that occur on the studied area hémain 1986 the double triangular type was used to create the synthetic storm event of 5yrp simulating the uds operation on the synthetic event of 5yrp presents the same observations found for the event of 31 august 2015 the resulting flooding volume for the synthetic event of 5yrp is 1013 m3 modelling results show that the system s operation is enhanced after removing the existing check valve and flow regulator installed downstream of the retention tank flooding volumes were reduced to 853 m3 and 889 m3 for the 31 august 2015 and 5yrp events respectively the obtained results highlight one of the benefits of understanding the uds operation 4 5 implementing the proactive management strategy the implementation of the proactive management strategy on the studied sector of the university campus consists of replacing the flow regulator and check valve downstream of the retention tank with a dynamic valve the dynamic valve will be able to change its opening ratio during a storm event according to the optimal time state schedule calculated by the mpc the optimisation process will be evaluated according to its efficiency in delivering the optimal valve state schedule vss for the least required calculation time and computation capabilities the parallel calculation of the ga was developed using matlab r2015 a software the process for optimising the vss is presented in fig 6 the iterative calculations are conducted between matlab r2015 a and the epa swmm model after each simulation the matlab script extracts the results and calculates the total flooding volume by aggregating the flooding volumes generated from all the manholes the total flooding volume is then sent to the ga as the objective function value to be reduced through the iterations conducting the simulations on a complete epa swmm hydrologic hydraulic simulation model was necessary for this study in order to efficiently quantify the flooding volume that appears on secondary branches due to the backwater and flow reversal generated after the surcharge of the main collector multiple structures of the vss were evaluated the adopted one is characterised by a changing state occurring each 6 min across a 2 h horizon in addition the vss solution space was reduced by discretising the valve state into 5 options represented by completely closed 0 25 50 75 to a completely opened valve 100 the purpose of this study is limited to presenting the profitability of applying a proactive management strategy that uses mpc for controlling the actuators of uds therefore none of the network elements were replaced and the pipe connecting the retention tank to the uds was conserved in its actual state 4 6 robustness evaluation of the mpc since ga is a stochastic optimisation technique work was dedicated to evaluating the robustness of the mpc in maintaining the same level of performance during its application the evaluation of the system s robustness was conducted on the severe storm event of 31 august 2015 and the synthetic event of 5yrp ten optimisation trials were conducted for each of five different population sizes of 30 60 90 120 and 150 individuals each optimisation trial ran the ga over 50 iterations for all the trials the final obtained results reveal the similarity in the calculated optimal vss and achieved flooding volume reductions these results affirm the robustness of the mpc and its optimisation technique in converging to the same efficient vss after completing 50 iterations fig 7 presents the performance of the mpc over the 10 trials conducted on the synthetic event of 5yrp and having population sizes of 60 and 120 individuals the plotted performances indicate similar behaviour during all the iterations of the conducted trials similar results were found for all the population sizes and both of the studied storm events the similarities in performance of the trials become more evident after completing the 20th iteration it was also noticed that an improvement in the system s operation and the use of the retention tank capacity illustrated by reduced flooding volume was achieved directly after the first iteration the performance for the 5 tested population sizes showing flooding volume reduction achieved after each iteration were compared and analysed with the aim of reducing the number of iterations and population size required to reach the optimal vss 4 7 required population size and iteration number a comparison between the average performances for the 10 trials on the different population sizes makes it possible to define the minimum required population size and number of iterations for the optimisation technique to find the optimal vss reducing the population size leads to a reduction in the required number of computing cores to conduct the parallel calculations at each iteration the calculations are conducted for a new population of individuals hence reducing the number of iterations reduces the required computation time fig 8 presents the average performances calculated using the 5 tested populations for both of the storm events the population size continues to affect the performance of the optimisation process until the 20th iteration is complete once the algorithms exceed the 20th iteration all population sizes except 30 converge to a very similar and constant performance the obtained results affirm that a population size of 60 individuals is able to converge after 20 iterations to an efficient vss solution the 1200 simulations 20 iterations 60 individuals required to calculate the objective value for all the individuals during the iterations of the ga were conducted on the cluster of the computer resource centre of lille university using intel xeon e5 2670 v3 processors with a total of 60 parallel computing cores the mpc system was able to optimise the vss in less than 10 min this result leads to an mpc application that is able to restart the optimisation every 10 min and hence enables a significant reduction in weather forecast uncertainties 4 8 efficiency of the mpc in 10 min of calculation time and using 60 computing cores the mpc system demonstrates the ability to reduce the total flooding volume to 826 m3 and 828 m3 for the storm events of 31 august 2015 and 5yrp respectively by comparing the results of the mpc to the results found after removing the static actuators section 4 4 an increase in the efficiency of using the storage capacity of the 280 m3 retention tank by 9 6 27 m3 and 21 8 61 m3 was found for the 31 august 2015 and 5yrp storm events respectively it was noticed that the potential of the proactive management strategy in enhancing the use of the retention tank capacity depends on the characteristics of the storm event duration total depth distribution of the rainfall intensities etc plotting the rainfall intensity the flow in the main collector and the resulted vss help in understanding and evaluating the changes applied by the proactive management strategy on the system operation at each time step fig 9 presents the results found for the two studied storm events the storm event of 31 august 2015 is characterised by very high rainfall intensities occurring in a short period of time at the beginning of the event followed by low intensity rainfalls such events consume the storage capacity of the retention tank at the beginning of the storm instead of allocating it to a more critical time this explains why the proactive management strategy presents a slight advantage in enlarging the retention capacity compared to a simple open pipe the optimal vss for this event indicates an open valve during the first time steps and thus the system with or without the proactive management strategy will operate approximately the same after time step 7 42 min flooding disappeared from the site as shown in fig 9 b and thus the valve opening ratios at the following time steps do not affect the total flooding volume a multi objective function that takes the process and speed of emptying the retention tank into account could benefit from a situation of opening the valve and accelerating the emptying of the tank such an application is especially efficient when new high rainfall intensities are forecasted on the other hand the synthetic storm of 5yrp is spread over a longer period of time with 15 min of high rainfall intensities occurring at the middle of the event this is the reason behind the proactive management strategy s increased efficiency in using the retention tank capacity during this event fig 9 d shows that at the beginning of the event before reaching high flow values the valve was half opened during these time steps the retention tank was emptying the water content generated from its upstream area once the flow increases rapidly the valve becomes totally closed even if floods appear during these time steps the proactive management strategy finds it more efficient to allocate the storage capacity of the retention tank to a later and more critical time after a certain time the valve is fully opened for 3 consecutive time steps 18 min and water is directed to the retention tank in the most beneficial way later the valve is half closed in order to limit the interaction between the two branches and protect the main collector from being surcharged during the tank emptying process finally after the flooding disappeared from the studied sector the vss calculated values are arbitrary because they no longer affect the resulted total flooding volume these findings highlight the efficiency of using an mpc for optimizing the control and operation of uds over rtc based solely on actual measurements and rainfall intensities a system which evaluates in advance the distribution of rainfall intensities and its effects on the uds operation was found to be very efficient in managing the capacities of retention structures and allocating their storage volumes to the most critical time 5 conclusion increased urbanisation aging infrastructures and climate change are the main causes behind surcharging and overstressing the uds recent technological advances offering high modelling potential computation capabilities connected sensors dynamic actuators and communication systems make it possible to optimise control of the actuators of uds this work focuses on developing an efficient mpc system for optimising the time state schedule of actuators within uds using a complete hydrologic hydraulic simulation model ga was selected to be evaluated as the optimisation technique for the mpc thanks to its efficiency in real life applications its potential for conducting simultaneous local and global searches and its population orientation nature during the evaluation of the proactive management strategy on a sector of lille university campus the mpc system performed well showing good robustness and efficiency requiring a server of 60 computation cores and 10 min of calculation time for each periodical optimisation the mpc succeeded in increasing the retention tank capacity without applying any modification to the network s elements by 9 6 and 21 8 during the storm events of 31 august 2015 and 5yrp respectively the resulting improvements highlight the efficiency of the mpc in strengthening the uds operations and improving the use of their storage capacities applying proactive management strategies that use mpc for operating large uds could benefit from neural networks to define the initial population for the optimisation techniques once trained on historical and modelled data a neural network could be efficient in predicting multiple recommended solutions for the initial iteration of the optimisation algorithms in addition employing an mpc system in a proactive management strategy that prioritises flooded manholes according to their location date and time of the event and the consequences of failures could also be efficient in floods mitigation

evacuated by drainage infrastructures fan et al 2017 yu et al 2017 in addition the aging of urban drainage systems uds components is leading to different types of structural failures reducing their hydraulic capacities ugarelli and federico 2010 consequently over the past few decades operational shortages have been increasingly occurring in uds resulting in environmental pollution floods and casualties zeleňáková et al 2017 as these have considerable social economic and environmental impacts strengthening uds to be able to limit flooding and pollution events becomes a priority for water engineers abou rjeily et al 2017 hammond et al 2013 as a result many research studies have been dedicated to improving the performance of uds to operate efficiently under climate conditions and volume loadings that exceed their initial designed capacities karl et al 2009 lee et al 2017 milly et al 2008 solomon et al 2007 real time monitoring rtm and control rtc systems have been presented in the literature as a promising solution for increasing the uds capacities abou rjeily et al 2017 ficchì et al 2016 garcía et al 2015 schütze et al 2004 rtm systems involve implementing connected sensors in critical locations within the uds different types of sensors are used to monitor uds operations these can be water level meters flowmeters turbidity meters weather stations etc in addition to their direct contribution in rtc applications sensor measurements help engineers to understand evaluate and improve the operation of the uds rtc is based on dynamically operating the ancillary equipment of uds to efficiently benefit from the entire system capacity schütze et al 2003 rtc was found more appropriate than off line control for managing uds due to the dynamic and stochastic nature of drainage infrastructures and storm events jacobson 2011 multiple classifications of rtc exist they are determined by desired management complexity and objectives rtc classifications are separated into two major types heuristic and optimisation based algorithms heuristic algorithms are solely based on an operator s experience without modelling results optimisation based algorithms aim to optimise the uds operation based on real time measurements and simulation results both of these rtc types could be reactive or predictive systems reactive systems use actual values to operate the uds while predictive systems aim to adjust system operations to meet future conditions and forecasts an extensive review of simulation models and rtc for uds is presented in garcía et al 2015 the main challenge in implementing a predictive rtc with optimisation based algorithms lies in its capacity to consistently find the most convenient actions that should be applied using the actuators of the uds model predictive control mpc has been presented in the literature as an efficient decision support system and has been successfully applied in different fields including the water industry ocampo martinez et al 2013 vermuyten et al 2018 xu 2017 zimmer et al 2018 however some problems remain open in the mpc applications such as adaptation robustness and distributed mpc christofides et al 2013 garcía et al 2015 lee 2011 being predictive and aiming to find the optimal solution is a challenge for an efficient mpc the challenge of running iterative simulations to find the best operational scenario before it is too late was treated in the literature using simplified control oriented models garcía et al 2015 despite their efficiency in reducing the required calculation time and thus allowing the mpc to be predictive control oriented models ignore some hydraulic phenomenon and simplify the results this can lead to an incorrect evaluation of the solutions and consequent robustness problems therefore this paper focuses on developing an mpc that efficiently and consistently evaluates the different operation scenarios for the actuators of the uds and return the optimal operation scenario in a feasible and applicable calculation period the results efficiency and robustness of the developed mpc will be evaluated on a sector of the lille university campus where floods appear annually during severe storm events 2 description of the proactive management strategy the proactive management strategy described in this work is based on an mpc system for computing the optimal time state schedules for the actuators of uds the optimisation will be conducted in advance through iterative calculations that search for the best system performance the mpc conducts the iterative calculations using a hydrologic hydraulic simulation engine fig 1 shows the process for the proactive management strategy application once a severe storm event is forecasted the proactive management strategy updates the initial conditions of the mpc according to the measurements of an implemented real time monitoring system sensor measurements are collected through connecting to a scada system simultaneously weather forecasts such as rainfall intensities radar images and temperatures are introduced as input data to the simulation model this allows optimisation to be conducted in advance finally before running the simulations boundary conditions such as the outfall water depth variation are introduced to the model according to the uds size and characteristics simulations will be conducted for a duration longer than the weather forecast time horizon in order to predict the full response of the uds simulation model run duration since the proactive management strategy is based on forecasted weather the optimisation time horizon is bound by acceptable degrees of confidence in the accuracy of the rainfall forecast over time iterations start once the weather forecast is available and consume time from the optimisation horizon as shown in fig 1 calculation time therefore computation time is critical and should be effectively reduced also reduced computation time allows more frequent restarting of the optimisation for the same storm event this then allows more frequent control system adjustments by updating sensor measurements boundary conditions and weather forecasts the adjustments also serve to reduce the uncertainties of the inputs to the model by replacing the weather forecasts during the hindcast period with measured rainfall intensities once the iterative calculations are conducted the resulted optimal time state schedules are sent as commands to the actuators through an opc connection to a scada system 3 simulation model and optimisation technique the aim of this work is to use a complete hydrologic hydraulic simulation model for the iterative calculations and evaluation of the solutions in order to develop an efficient and robust mpc a complete hydrologic hydraulic model offers more detailed simulations than a control oriented model and presents results for the entire uds operation this choice helps the mpc quantify the total flooding volumes efficiently especially when floods appear on secondary branches and are due to backwater and flow reversal effects using a complete epa swmm model extends the calculation time which is a limitation for the mpc to overcome this limitation improvements were applied to the calculation process of the optimisation technique used in this study due to its success in real life applications its population orientation nature and its efficiency in performing simultaneous global and local searches genetic algorithms ga was selected as the optimisation technique for the mpc ga is suitable for applications with objective functions that are not convex continuous or differentiable this fact generalises its effectiveness for all types of real life applications shi et al 2016 after generating a set of random solutions called initial population ga performs a calculation loop over a number of iterations at each iteration the algorithm calculates the objective function values for all the solutions within a population and ranks them according to their efficiencies better ranked solutions are more likely to be selected to form new solutions for the next iteration by crossover and mutation genetic operations since ga evaluates a population of independent solutions at each iteration the reduction of computation time was based on distributing and parallelising the objective function calculations for all the individuals of a population simultaneously on different servers and computing cores 4 application the stormwater network of a critical sector at the lille university campus was used to implement and evaluate the proposed mpc the total area of the studied sector is 30 ha the stormwater network presented in fig 2 consists of underground pipes with diameters between 150 and 1200 mm a retention tank composed of 4 parallel large diameter pipes with a total volume of 280 m3 is installed on the studied area the objective of this tank is to protect the main collector from being surcharged during severe storm events by storing and slowing the runoff generated from its upstream newly constructed area therefore at its outlet the tank has a static flow regulator to regulate the discharge to 10 l s and a check valve for allocating its retention capacity to the water generated from its upstream area from 1960 onwards the studied sector has seen continuous expansion due to the construction of new buildings and impermeable surfaces since that time floods have appeared annually on this sector during severe storm events fig 2 shows a flooding event that occurred on 31 august 2015 the flooding area is extremely dangerous since it appears in low topographical zones near university buildings a flood depth of 50 cm enables the water to enter the buildings posing a risk to researchers and equipment installed in underground laboratories 4 1 real time monitoring system implementation since hydraulic operation shortages are presented on the campus each year in march 2015 the studied sector was equipped with a monitoring system to understand and evaluate its hydraulic operation fig 3 presents the different types of sensors that were implemented on the studied area a weather station nb1 two flowmeters nb2 and nb3 and two water level meters nb4 and nb5 were used as the quantitative sensors of the monitoring system water quality of the runoff generated from the studied area was evaluated by a turbidity meter nb6 implemented within the uds the monitoring system was initialised to take measurements at a 1 min time step the monitoring system was very efficient in detecting flooding events and presenting the hydraulic operation at the locations of the implemented sensors aiming to understand the entire uds operation and to evaluate the floods origins the monitoring system was combined with a hydrologic hydraulic simulation model 4 2 hydrologic hydraulic simulation model the model was built on the epa swmm software dynamic wave was selected as the routing model to account for backwater effects pressurised flow flow reversal and channel storage the epa swmm model was auto calibrated using ga and pattern search optimisation techniques on 10 different rainfall events an average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value of 0 75 was calculated for the 10 rainfall events that were used in the calibration phase in addition the model was verified on 10 different rainfall events not included in the calibration process resulting in an average nse value of 0 71 fig 4 presents the comparison between measured and modelled flow for an event used in the calibration process 13 09 2015 and an event used for the verification of the model 21 11 2015 respectively 4 3 boundary conditions forecast system since a sector of the uds is modelled in this study the water depth variation in the last modelled manhole outfall of the modelled sector cannot be simulated and should be introduced as boundary conditions for the model outfall water depth variation affects the model simulation results especially when the system is surcharged therefore the boundary conditions are necessary for the epa swmm model in order to simulate the real effect of the un modelled downstream network on the modelled upstream network for monitored events these boundary conditions are measured by the water level meter nb5 in fig 3 for synthetic and forecasted events these boundary conditions should be predicted before running the simulations the outfall water depth variation is a complex hydrologic hydraulic response of the uds to a rainfall event due to its capability of predicting the water level variation in a manhole abou rjeily et al 2017 a nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx was developed and trained to predict the water depth variation at the outfall the efficiency of the narx neural network was evaluated on 10 different rainfall events resulting in a regression value of 0 986 in addition the narx neural network efficiency was tested graphically during a 5 day rainfall event this showed similarities between measured and predicted data as illustrated in fig 5 4 4 analysis of the uds hydraulic operation simulation results of the uds operation applied to the severe storm event of 31 august 2015 which caused floods on the university campus are presented in abou rjeily et al 2016 the results show that flooding appears on secondary branches located in low topographical areas due to backwater and reversal flows generated after the surcharge of the main collector in addition it was noticed that the installed static equipment downstream of the retention tank flow regulator and check valve are disconnecting the branches of the uds and thus limit the operational capacity of the stormwater network the flooding volume generated during this event is 869 m3 due to the stochastic nature of rainfall events the system operation was also studied on a synthetic storm event with a 5 year return period yrp as it provides a good representation of rainfall events that occur on the studied area hémain 1986 the double triangular type was used to create the synthetic storm event of 5yrp simulating the uds operation on the synthetic event of 5yrp presents the same observations found for the event of 31 august 2015 the resulting flooding volume for the synthetic event of 5yrp is 1013 m3 modelling results show that the system s operation is enhanced after removing the existing check valve and flow regulator installed downstream of the retention tank flooding volumes were reduced to 853 m3 and 889 m3 for the 31 august 2015 and 5yrp events respectively the obtained results highlight one of the benefits of understanding the uds operation 4 5 implementing the proactive management strategy the implementation of the proactive management strategy on the studied sector of the university campus consists of replacing the flow regulator and check valve downstream of the retention tank with a dynamic valve the dynamic valve will be able to change its opening ratio during a storm event according to the optimal time state schedule calculated by the mpc the optimisation process will be evaluated according to its efficiency in delivering the optimal valve state schedule vss for the least required calculation time and computation capabilities the parallel calculation of the ga was developed using matlab r2015 a software the process for optimising the vss is presented in fig 6 the iterative calculations are conducted between matlab r2015 a and the epa swmm model after each simulation the matlab script extracts the results and calculates the total flooding volume by aggregating the flooding volumes generated from all the manholes the total flooding volume is then sent to the ga as the objective function value to be reduced through the iterations conducting the simulations on a complete epa swmm hydrologic hydraulic simulation model was necessary for this study in order to efficiently quantify the flooding volume that appears on secondary branches due to the backwater and flow reversal generated after the surcharge of the main collector multiple structures of the vss were evaluated the adopted one is characterised by a changing state occurring each 6 min across a 2 h horizon in addition the vss solution space was reduced by discretising the valve state into 5 options represented by completely closed 0 25 50 75 to a completely opened valve 100 the purpose of this study is limited to presenting the profitability of applying a proactive management strategy that uses mpc for controlling the actuators of uds therefore none of the network elements were replaced and the pipe connecting the retention tank to the uds was conserved in its actual state 4 6 robustness evaluation of the mpc since ga is a stochastic optimisation technique work was dedicated to evaluating the robustness of the mpc in maintaining the same level of performance during its application the evaluation of the system s robustness was conducted on the severe storm event of 31 august 2015 and the synthetic event of 5yrp ten optimisation trials were conducted for each of five different population sizes of 30 60 90 120 and 150 individuals each optimisation trial ran the ga over 50 iterations for all the trials the final obtained results reveal the similarity in the calculated optimal vss and achieved flooding volume reductions these results affirm the robustness of the mpc and its optimisation technique in converging to the same efficient vss after completing 50 iterations fig 7 presents the performance of the mpc over the 10 trials conducted on the synthetic event of 5yrp and having population sizes of 60 and 120 individuals the plotted performances indicate similar behaviour during all the iterations of the conducted trials similar results were found for all the population sizes and both of the studied storm events the similarities in performance of the trials become more evident after completing the 20th iteration it was also noticed that an improvement in the system s operation and the use of the retention tank capacity illustrated by reduced flooding volume was achieved directly after the first iteration the performance for the 5 tested population sizes showing flooding volume reduction achieved after each iteration were compared and analysed with the aim of reducing the number of iterations and population size required to reach the optimal vss 4 7 required population size and iteration number a comparison between the average performances for the 10 trials on the different population sizes makes it possible to define the minimum required population size and number of iterations for the optimisation technique to find the optimal vss reducing the population size leads to a reduction in the required number of computing cores to conduct the parallel calculations at each iteration the calculations are conducted for a new population of individuals hence reducing the number of iterations reduces the required computation time fig 8 presents the average performances calculated using the 5 tested populations for both of the storm events the population size continues to affect the performance of the optimisation process until the 20th iteration is complete once the algorithms exceed the 20th iteration all population sizes except 30 converge to a very similar and constant performance the obtained results affirm that a population size of 60 individuals is able to converge after 20 iterations to an efficient vss solution the 1200 simulations 20 iterations 60 individuals required to calculate the objective value for all the individuals during the iterations of the ga were conducted on the cluster of the computer resource centre of lille university using intel xeon e5 2670 v3 processors with a total of 60 parallel computing cores the mpc system was able to optimise the vss in less than 10 min this result leads to an mpc application that is able to restart the optimisation every 10 min and hence enables a significant reduction in weather forecast uncertainties 4 8 efficiency of the mpc in 10 min of calculation time and using 60 computing cores the mpc system demonstrates the ability to reduce the total flooding volume to 826 m3 and 828 m3 for the storm events of 31 august 2015 and 5yrp respectively by comparing the results of the mpc to the results found after removing the static actuators section 4 4 an increase in the efficiency of using the storage capacity of the 280 m3 retention tank by 9 6 27 m3 and 21 8 61 m3 was found for the 31 august 2015 and 5yrp storm events respectively it was noticed that the potential of the proactive management strategy in enhancing the use of the retention tank capacity depends on the characteristics of the storm event duration total depth distribution of the rainfall intensities etc plotting the rainfall intensity the flow in the main collector and the resulted vss help in understanding and evaluating the changes applied by the proactive management strategy on the system operation at each time step fig 9 presents the results found for the two studied storm events the storm event of 31 august 2015 is characterised by very high rainfall intensities occurring in a short period of time at the beginning of the event followed by low intensity rainfalls such events consume the storage capacity of the retention tank at the beginning of the storm instead of allocating it to a more critical time

6962,mediterranean rivers are affected by natural disturbances and human pressures which may alter their hydrology water quality and habitat structure in this study an analysis of macroinvertebrates community structure has been used to determine how distinct human pressures such as point and non point sources of pollution together with groundwater withdrawal may affect these ecosystems a total of 4 sampling campaigns were conducted in the middle reach of the onyar river ne spain which was affected by agricultural and urban uses stream discharge and physicochemical parameters were measured in situ and water samples and macroinvertebrates assemblages were taken and properly preserved for subsequent analysis and identification variation partitioning showed that macroinvertebrate community structure was particularly dependent on hydrochemical characteristics but also on hydrological variations in addition results indicated that groundwater withdrawal altered stream hydrology and the main reach of the onyar river became intermittent and even completely dry in downstream positions this reduction on stream discharge caused changes in habitat characteristics as well as in the proportion of wastewater some wastewater dilution occurred linked to groundwater with high nitrate concentrations inputs to the stream and even though the macroinvertebrate community recovered its quality in some sampling campaigns it presented a different structure than in sampling points not affected by any of these pressures therefore the approach here used to analyze the hydrological effects on macroinvertebrate communities allowed us to determine their influence on hydrochemical and habitat characteristics keywords hydrological alterations groundwater exploitation point source pollution non point source pollution macroinvertebrate community 1 introduction mediterranean rivers are characterized by a variable flow regime with dry summers and winters and rainy springs and autumns these ecosystems show seasonal and predictable disturbances such as floods and droughts bonada et al 2007 and may be characterized by four different general flow categories according to boulton et al 2000 1 ephemeral flow briefly with irregular timing 1 month and usually only after unpredictable rain has fallen 2 intermittent or temporary streams flow for longer periods 1 3 months regularly have an annual dry period coinciding with prolonged dry weather 3 semi permanent streams flow most of the year but cease flow during dry weather 3 months drying to pools and 4 permanent streams with perennial flow except for rare extreme droughts however these ecosystems may be affected by different kinds of pressures which may alter stream hydrology water quality and habitat structure e g allan 2004 theodoropoulus et al 2015 pressures on water quality can be classified according to their origin urban and industrial wastewater discharges whether treated or not can be considered as a point type pressure that modifies surface water hydrochemistry in addition streams may be affected by non point source pollution caused by surface and subsurface runoff from croplands and urban areas which is seasonal and highly affected by climate variability land use may not only affect stream water quality but also hydrology and habitat structure in mediterranean areas alterations on flow regime caused by water regulation direct extractions or groundwater overexploitation reduce the quality of water as well as its availability to support a functional aquatic ecosystem miller et al 1989 sánchez and schmidt 2012 benejam et al 2010 menció et al 2014 therefore these alterations may enhance the effects of droughts in these ecosystems depending on duration of dry periods and the basin and reach characteristics drought intensity may range from declines in discharge below average baseflow levels to intermittency and even to total drying of the river channel with increasing effects for the biota e g pires et al 1999 rincón and cressa 2000 boulton 2003 magoulick and kobza 2003 hakala and hartman 2004 davey and kelly 2007 benejam et al 2010 boix et al 2010 tornés and ruhí 2013 stubbington et al 2018 streams and rivers in the mediterranean basin that were compatible with agricultural activity for thousands of years are now clearly negatively affected by current intensive agriculture and other human activities such as industry channelization construction of dams or settlement growth hooke 2006 terrado et al 2014 water quality was affected but also habitat and hydrologic alteration has been widely reported e g benejam et al 2010 belmar et al 2013 merciai et al 2017 moreover mediterranean climate increases the water abstraction concern due to his characteristic period of dry weather and high temperatures which imply large water level fluctuations gasith and resh 1999 bolle 2003 these impacts on hydrochemistry hydrology and habitat connote changes in community population structure and even species survival e g rubio gracia et al 2017 merciai et al 2018 mor et al 2018 macroinvertebrates are for a long time widely used in order to evaluate water quality and ecosystem health especially in lotic ecosystems hellawell 1986 metcalfe 1989 therefore advantages and difficulties of using macroinvertebrates with these goals arewell known rosenberg and resh 1993 moreover various technical developments such as indices have enabled macroinvertebrates to be used advantageously in biomonitoring programs e g wright et al 2000 camargo et al 2004 munné and prat 2009 in these sense it is important to underly that the structure of macroinvertebrate assemblages have been related to hydrochemistry hydrology and habitat changes jointly or separately in many zones graczyk 1993 poff et al 2010 wilding et al 2018 including mediterranean areas e g acuña et al 2005 bonada et al 2006 boix et al 2010 benetti et al 2012 garcia et al 2017 according to the european water framework directive wfd directive 2000 60 ec ec 2000 european countries are under the obligation to protect natural water bodies from environmental and hydrological deterioration and while meeting this requirements insure water supplies for human needs in order to achieve this goal management decisions should not worsen the ecological status of these water bodies and should be based on a good knowledge of the hydrogeological processes and dynamics that maintain river discharge in a previous work menció et al 2014 we analyzed the stream aquifer relationship in the onyar river watershed comparing different methodologies the aim of this new study is to analyze how distinct human pressures point and non point sources of pollution together with groundwater withdrawal may affect macroinvertebrates community based on the previous results groundwater exploitation modifies flow regimes and streams run unusually low changing habitats in a process called lentification sabater 2008 additionally due to this decrease in stream flow a lower dilution of treated and untreated wastewater discharges occurs worsening stream water quality finally nitrate groundwater pollution may affect stream quality during gaining stream situations this scenario offered the opportunity to analyze the effects of hydrology on habitats water and macroinvertebrates community characteristics we hypothesized that hydrological changes i e changes on flow regime would affect seasonal and longitudinal macroinvertebrates community distribution moreover in those areas where human pressures are relevant hydrological patterns determine water quality that in turn determines the composition of macroinvertebrate community therefore hydrological effects over macroinvertebrate community would not only be caused directly by changes in habitat characteristics but also indirectly by water quality specifically the objectives of this study are 1 to determine the effects of hydrology on habitats and stream water quality 2 to assess the role of hydrology on macroinvertebrate assemblages in anthropized environments and 3 to assess which measures of community structure and quality could describe better the impacts related to hydrology modification from a management point of view 1 1 study area the onyar river watershed has an area of 295 km2 and is located

in some specific areas streambed sediments are mainly gravel and sand between r1 and r4 locations and gravel sand and clay downstream from r5 to r12 in fig 1 the maximum thickness of alluvial deposits is of 15 m approx constituting a significant groundwater reservoir and allowing effective base flow control during dry seasons under no exploitation conditions mas pla et al 1985 folch et al 2011 menció et al 2014 this area has been affected by several human pressures which modify stream flow and surface and groundwater water quality folch et al 2011 menció and mas pla 2008 2010 menció et al 2014 with a total population of 137 510 inhabitants this watershed has an intensive agricultural and livestock production slurry and manure produced by husbandry activities are used as the main fertilizer for crops and synthetic fertilizers are also applied puig et al 2013 up to 40 5 of the agricultural land 4700 ha approx is irrigated using groundwater supply with sprinkler irrigation for arable crops and drip irrigation in orchards darp 2017 this intense groundwater exploitation for agriculture purposes from may to october causes severe head level downward capturing the stream flow and drying up the main stream therefore treated waste water effluents and waste water discharges with low or null treatment in isolated housing areas also affect the onyar river consequently this area has been classified as a nitrate vulnerable zone nvz as a result of the transposition of the nitrate directive nd 91 676 ec therefore nitrate concentrations in groundwater are higher than 50 mg no3 l in most of the boreholes fig 1 menció et al 2012 2014 puig et al 2013 the studied reach of the onyar river in this work has a total length of 11 km and it is located in its middle course between the municipalities of vilobí d onyar sant dalmai village and riudellots de la selva fig 1 in this sector the alluvial aquifer presents a total area of 12 km2 and a maximum depth of 15 m in its central part this reach is located just before the confluence of one of its main tributaries the rest of the tributaries in this area were dry during the studied period and the main course received waste water without treatment from sant dalmai sewage network and inputs from the vilobí d onyar waste water treatment plant ca 3000 inhabitants ww1 and ww2 respectively in fig 1 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling ten sampling points were selected at variable distances to track discharge changes related to stream aquifer exchange or waste water treatment plant inputs along the onyar river r1 r2 r4 r5 r7 r8 r9 r10 r11 and r12 in fig 1 during field campaigns conducted in november 2010 autumn february 2011 winter may 2011 spring and july 2011 summer discharge was recorded in all of them using the mechanical current meter method the stream channel cross section was divided in numerous vertical subsections at intervals of 0 30 0 50 m stream flow velocity was determined using a current meter at each subsection and discharge in each of them was computed by multiplying the subsection area by the measured velocity the total discharge was computed summing the discharge of each subsection additionally stream water samples were taken in these sites for hydrochemical analysis after filtration 0 45 μm samples were acidified in the field for cation determination and stored in a fridge at 4 c in a dark environment for subsequent analyses physicochemical parameters were measured in situ using a crison cm35 portable conductivity meter with a temperature measurement capability to determine water temperature and electrical conductivity ec accuracy ec 0 5 temperature 0 2 c ph and eh were also measured in situ with a wtw 330i ph mv meter accuracy ph 0 003 ph eh 0 2 mv and dissolved oxygen was measured with a crison oxi45p portable meter accuracy do 0 5 macroinvertebrates were collected at r1 r4 r8 r9 and r11 sampling sites using a surber sampler of 0 1 m2 surface area with 500 μm mesh net samples were collected using the quantitative method of hering et al 2004 adapted to mediterranean rivers boix et al 2010 consisted in sampling 12 subsamples collected according to the relative abundance of the potential substratum type the considered substrata were bryophytes submerged hydrophytes helophytes algae submerged roots coarse particulate organic matter flat bedrock boulders 256 mm cobbles and coarse gravel 25 256 mm gravels 2 25 mm coarse and medium sands 2 mm and fine sands to lutite 0 1 mm in every sampling site eight substrata were sampled in the dominant 5 and four in the marginal 5 substrata the 12 subsamples were merged in one sample then preserved with 4 formaldehyde stored and identified in the laboratory 2 2 water and macroinvertebrate analysis alkalinity as hco3 was determined using gran titration their inter day average precision with percent relative standard deviation rsd was 1 nitrogen as total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn ammonium nh4 nitrites no2 and nitrates no3 was analyzed according to apha 2005 with a rsd of 1 2 8 2 8 and 2 4 respectively organic nitrogen was determined by difference of tkn with the ammonium nitrogen cl po4 3 and so4 2 using capillary electrophoresis with indirect uv detection with a rsd of 2 9 and 2 2 and ca2 mg2 na and k using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icpaes with a rsd of 7 0 1 1 3 6 and 1 1 respectively bromide was analyzed by icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry rsd of 1 9 the quality of the chemical analysis was checked performing the ionic mass balance with all samples showing an error lower than 5 macroinvertebrate taxa were identified at genus level under a motic smz 168 bl zoom stereo microscope 50 magnification except for diptera and platyhelminthes that were identified at family level and oligochaeta that were identified at subclass level using tachet et al 2000 2 3 environmental variables in order to determine the hydrological habitat and hydrochemical effects on macroinvertebrate community distinct indicators and sets of variables have been considered hydrologic characteristics of the distinct sampling points were previously determined in menció et al 2014 for the present analysis three different variables were considered a the proportion of surface water groundwater and waste water in l s for each sampling point determined through an end member mixing analyses emma christophersen et al 1990 mas pla et al 2013 b the proportion of surface water groundwater and waste water in for each sampling point determined through emma and c the incremental stream flow measure harvey and wagner 2000 the last approach states that any change downstream in volumetric discharge in a reach without tributaries is due to water fluxes across the streambed and thus net groundwater fluxes can be computed as the differences between stream flows and successive cross sections when the difference in discharge between a sampling point and the previous one was positive a gaining stream situation was assumed g in contrast when the result was negative a losing stream situation was considered l and finally when the value was 0 a non relationship situation was considered nr in contrast with emma approach sampling points were classified according to their percentage of groundwater contribution using a threshold of 20 or wastewater contribution considering two thresholds of 15 and 20 of wastewater to the stream discharge habitat characteristics were determined using the percentage of the 12 substrata types defined in the previous section as well as the fluvial habitat index fhi index for mediterranean streams described by pardo et al 2002 hydrochemical characteristics were considered using the parameters described in the previous section as well as using the results of a principal component analysis pca considering all these data the pca was performed in order to identify associations between variables since the resulting varifactors are usually adequate to indicate the influence of seasonal or human factors on hydrochemical processes e g helena et al 2000 menció and mas pla 2008 finally a matrix based on macroinvertebrate data was created this matrix contained the hellinger transformation square root transformation of the abundances individuals of each assemblage according to the taxonomic level described previously in order to express the data as relative abundances bocard et al 2011 additionally different community parameters such as shannon wiener diversity index sw the total number of different ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera taxa as ept the total number of odonata coleoptera and hemiptera as och bonada et al 2007 and the iberian bio monitoring working party index ibmwp index munné and prat 2009 were also calculated 2 4 data analysis when hydrological habitat and community variables were normally distributed anova f dependent samples t tests for sampling periods and independent samples t test were conducted to identify relationships among groups of samples otherwise non parametric tests were used mann whitney u test and kruskal wallis h test as stated in the previous section a principal component analysis has been conducted to identify associations between hydrochemical parameters that could indicate the influence of seasonal dynamics human factors hydrochemical processes or the origin of stream discharge and also to reduce the number of variables for the variation partitioning the dataset considered for this analysis included all the hydrochemical variables determined ec ph eh t do hco3 cl so4 2 br ca2 mg2 na k po4 2 nh4 no2 no3 and norg in contrast to the previous study conducted by menció et al 2014 in this analysis only surface water samples were considered the comparison of macroinvertebrate assemblages between sampling points seasons and the influence of wastewater or groundwater in the stream discharge was performed by means of anosim analyses clarke and warwick 2001 anosim operates on a resemblance matrix and is similar to a standard univariate anova but does not require normality or homoscedasticity of data similarity percentages simper tests were also used to determine the assemblage similarity between sampling points seasons and groundwater and wastewater influence in the stream non parametric multidimensional scaling mds was performed in the onyar river samples to analyze the relationship between macroinvertebrate community structure with respect to their location along the stream reach analyzed taxa abundances were square root transformed and bray curtis was selected as a similarity distance anosim and simper tests mds and calculations of the assemblage parameters were performed by primer v 6 0 for windows additionally the effects of hydrological variables hydrochemcial conditions and habitat characteristics on the different biotic components were also analyzed by means of variation partitioning bocard et al 1992 legendre and legendre 1998 using the vegan package oksanen et al 2009 of r language r development core team 2008 variation partitioning was here used to decompose the variation of dependent variables in unique or pure and shared or joint effects of a set of predictors it is achieved by partial regression and redundancy analysis for multiple dependent variables square root transformed genus or family matrices according to peres neto et al 2006 the vegan package primarily uses adjusted r squares to assess the partitions explained by the predictors and their combinations three sets of predictors were considered including hydrological hdr hydrochemical hch and habitat hab variables the variation was decomposed in the following components pure hydrological effects hdr hab hch pure hydrochemical effects hch hab hdr and habitat effects hab hdr hch since the explanatory datasets predictors are generally not orthogonal to one another some variation was explained jointly non hydrological habitat hydrochemical effects hab hch hdr non habitat hydrological hydrochemical effects hdr hch hab non hydrochemical habitat hydrological effects hab hdr hch hydrological joint habitat hydrochemical effects hdr hab hch and finally the unexplained variation 1 hdr hab hch the overall effects unique plus shared with other components of habitat hydrochemical and hydrological effects were also reported a redundancy analysis rda was conducted previously to the variation partitioning in order to avoid collinearity and to select an appropriate group of variables for each predictor hab hdr and hch all the variables described in the previous section characterization of variables were considered for rda with a previous transformation concentrations of the different hydrochemical parameters except for ph and water flow were log10 transformed whereas the percentage estimates were arcsine transformed according to legendre and legendre 1998 however scores obtained from pca were not transformed 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal patterns of environmental variables variability of hydrological hydrochemical and habitat variables among sampling sites and campaigns were analyzed 3 1 1 hydrological characterization in fig 2 the distribution of the different sources of stream discharge classified as surface water groundwater and wastewater has been represented for all sampling campaigns based on menció et al 2014 the onyar river was not a permanent stream due to the capture of its flow during the summer season fig 2d table 1 this situation was caused by groundwater withdrawal for agricultural purposes and the continuous flow in the main stream was not recovered until significant precipitations occur in autumn therefore during summer season the stream was intermittent from r8 to r9 and completely dry in r11 fig 2d upstream of r1 sampling site there was not nor an extensive alluvial aquifer neither any waste water discharge for this reason the only source of water considered in r1 was surface water downstream the studied reach of the onyar river received two continuous wastewater discharges before sampling points r4 and r8 fig 2 and table 1 and thus the proportion of wastewater in the stream flow increased from 13 to 20 in winter and spring february 2011 and may 2011 to 24 57 in summer and autumn july 2011 and november 2010 in r8 r9 and r11 sites due to the lower contribution of surface water and groundwater to the stream discharge fig 2 these differences between the amount of wastewater in l s in the different sampling points were not significant nor for sampling sites h 7 693 df 4 p 0 104 neither for sampling campaigns h 5 249 df 3 p 0 154 but when wastewater values were considered as a percentage significant differences were detected between r1 and the rest of the sampling points f 3 876 df 4 p 0 025 finally the proportion of groundwater contribution to the stream flow varied depending on the sampling survey the lowest values were detected in winter february 2011 when a bank storage return situation was observed menció et al 2014 in the rest of the surveys groundwater contribution was between 27 and 40 of the stream flow in r8 r9 and r11 reaching up to 76 in r9 during the summer campaign when this sampling site was isolated from the rest due to the loss of the continuous flow fig 2 although these variations were not significant h 3 235 df 3 p 0 357 between sampling surveys when groundwater contribution was compared between sampling sites some significant differences were depicted this was the case of r1 and r8 r9 and r11 and also between r4 and r9 and r11 h 11 272 df 4 0 024 3 1 2 hydrochemical characterization in fig 3 nitrogen distribution as norg nh4 n no2 n and no3 n is represented for the different sampling points and campaigns when fig 3 is compared to fig 2 the most significant inputs of nitrogen are not only detected after waste water effluents but also when groundwater contribution was observed this situation is particularly depicted between r9 and r11 where an increase in no3 n was observed in most of the sampling campaigns together with a stream flow increase results of pca are shown in table 2 a total of 6 varifactors vf were obtained with eigenvalues over 1 explaining the 89 2 of the total variance after a varimax rotation the final vfs were interpreted as follows fig 3 vf1 included variables as na k cl hco3 mg2 and ec and others with a lower participation such as ca2 and br this vf represents the influence of waste water effluents since the samples that obtained the highest scores were those located downstream of waste water discharge points r4 r8 and r9 especially in summer campaigns figs 2 and 4 the variables with significant positive loadings for vf2 were so4 2 ca2 and br and norg and o2 obtained significant negative loadings this second vf is interpreted as groundwater contribution since the samples with higher scores for vf2 were those with percentages of groundwater in stream discharge higher than 24 and up to 76 r8 r9 and r11 figs 2 3 and table 1 finally vf3 vf4 vf5 and vf6 were those varifactors with a percentage of explained variance lower than 15 but associated to nutrients fig 4 vf3 was mainly linked to temperature but also to low no3 and nh4 content samples with the lowest scores for this vf were those linked to nitrate pollution in particular samples from r11 r9 r8 and r4 in autumn and winter campaigns when groundwater inputs into the stream were higher contrarily samples with the highest scores for vf3 were r1 r8 r9 in summer and r9 in spring part of these sampling points was isolated in these campaigns and their low no3 and nh4 concentrations were linked to nitrogen assimilation by photosynthetic organisms in the case of vf4 it presents a negative loading for po4 3 together with positive loadings for o2 ph linking the conditions that make possible the presence of po4 3 in the study area and depicting the sampling points where po4 3 was detected mainly in r4 r8 and r9 table 1 vf5 was associated to the presence of nh4 in this stream the main source of this compound is wastewater since the highest concentrations of ammonia were detected in wastewater discharges with mean values of 15 33 mg l finally vf6 was related to the presence of no2 in this case the two samples with the highest scores were r4 and r8 the only samples that showed some no2 in solution in spring due to the low presence of this compound in the study samples it is not possible to link its presence to any particular origin or process 3 1 3 habitat characteristics in table 3 habitat characteristics of the different sampling points have been represented according to these results when sampling sites characteristics were compared significant differences in the presence of bryophytes h 12 574 df 4 p 0 014 boulders h 15 031 df 4 p 0 005 and cobbles and coarse gravel were detected h 11 760 df 4 p 0 019 these differences were caused by a higher presence of bryophytes and boulders in r1 than in the rest of the sampling points and the higher proportions of cobbles and coarse gravel in r1 and r4 than in the rest of the sampling points besides temporal differences were observed when sampling campaigns were compared especially for the presence of logs and debris in the river bed h 10 537 df 3 p 0 015 additionally significant differences were observed for fhi values between sampling points f 7 353 df 4 p 0 002 and also for sampling campaigns these differences were significant due to the distinct values of r1 in comparison to the rest of the sampling points and for the lower values of fhi in winter and summer than in autumn and spring campaigns t 3 845 df 3 p 0 001 t 16 743 df 4 p 0 031 the lowest values during winter were caused by a flooding event and in summer due to the loss of stream discharge caused by groundwater withdrawal table 1 3 2 community parameters and assemblage variation in order to analyze the effects of human pressures on macroinvertebrates community different variables together with the comparison of macroinvertebrate assemblages have been determined these community variables here used were 1 the shannon wiener diversity index sw 2 the total number of ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera taxa as ept representative of lotic environments 3 the total number of odonata coleoptera and hemiptera as och organisms representative of lentic environments and finally 4 the ibmwp index iberian bio monitoring working party used to assess the ecological status of the iberian mediterranean rivers results of macroinvertebrate assemblages and community variables have been presented in sm1 table 4 and fig 5 these variables were analyzed considering a sampling points b sampling campaigns c groundwater influence and d wastewater influence a when sampling points were considered r1 was the sampling station with the highest values for ibmwp ept and shannon wiener sw diversity in most of the sampling campaigns sm1 fig 5 downstream a progressive decrease in these parameters was observed reaching the lowest values in r8 in all sampling campaigns finally certain recovery occurred in r9 and r11 stations especially in spring campaign these differences between sampling points were significant for ept h 11 012 df 4 p 0 026 but not for och f 0 058 df 4 p 0 993 ibmwp f 1 10 df 4 p 0 393 and sw diversity f 1 46 df 4 p 0 267 r1 showed the highest dissimilarities in macroinvertebrate assemblages with the rest of the sampling stations these dissimilarities were mainly caused by the constant presence of habrophlebia caenis polycentropus in this first sampling station together with the lowest abundances of ancylus physa and oligochaeta and simulidae families sm1 and sm3 in contrast the lowest dissimilarities were obtained between r4 and r8 the two sampling points located after waste water discharges in this case dissimilarity was mainly caused by higher abundances of caenis baetis and simulidae in r4 and lower abundances of cloeon and oligochaeta sm1 and sm3 b in contrast differences between sampling campaigns were significant for the ibmwp index f 5 93 df 3 p 0 007 due to differences between spring and winter campaigns t 3 63 df 4 p 0 022 and between spring and autumn campaigns t 5 70 df 4 p 0 005 showing the highest values of ibmwp in spring campaign in addition significant differences were observed for och f 10 653 df 3 p 0 001 showing lower values in autumn and winter than in spring campaign t 2 988 df 4 p 0 040 and t 3 266 df 3 p 0 047 and also lower och values in autumn than in summer t 4 190 df 4 p 0 014 when macroinvertebrate assemblages were compared considering sampling campaigns the highest dissimilarities were observed between summer july 2011 and autumn november 2010 summer and winter february 2011 and between spring may 2011 and autumn campaigns table 4 these differences were caused due to the higher abundances of oligochaeta and simulidae in autumn and winter campaigns and the lower abundances of baetis caenis ephemerella ancylus physa and galba c groundwater influence was tested using two distinct methodologies for classification the first one was the use of incremental stream flow measures to classify each sampling point according to its relationship with the alluvial aquifer considering the three groups of samples obtained with a gaining stream situation g a losing stream situation l or without relationship nr significant differences were only observed when ept data were compared h 7 584 df 2 p 0 023 showing nr the greatest numbers when samples classification was conducted taking into account the percentage of groundwater obtained in the emma two groups of samples were distinguished a first group was composed of those samples with a groundwater percentage higher than 20 of their discharge and the second one with those with a lower influence tables 1 and 4 using this second methodology no differences were obtained for composition parameters between these two groups of sampling points the highest dissimilarities between macroinvertebrate assemblages were observed between nr and g and between nr and l groups table 4 these dissimilarities were associated to higher abundances of habrophlebia caenis and polycentropus in nr group sampling point r1 and r9 in summer season and lower values for cloeon baetis physa and also simulidae and oligochaeta in contrast to nr group samples of g and i groups were located downstream of wastewater plants mainly from r4 r8 r9 and r11 sampling stations and when these two groups were compared differences between them were also detected in this case dissimilarities were caused by higher abundances in group g of baetis caenis and cloeon and lower values of simulidae oligochaeta and ancylus when groundwater influence was analyzed considering emma results dissimilarities were caused by higher abundances of habrophlebia caenis baetis and physa and lower abundances of cloeon simulidae and oligochaeta in sampling points with groundwater influence d additionally in order to consider wastewater influence two distinct classifications were also taken into account the first one considering as a threshold a 20 of wastewater composition in stream discharge and the second one considering only a 15 based on emma values of table 1 in this analysis no differences were obtained for none of the composition parameters except for ept u 18 500 p 0 033 considering a 15 of wastewater and for ept with u 13 000 and p 0 022 considering a 20 of wastewater in stream discharge composition showing the greatest numbers of ept in those sampling points with low wastewater influence in both cases dissimilarities between macroinvertebrate assemblages caused by wastewater influence suppose lower abundances of most of ephemeroptera genera observed baetis caenis and habrophlebia but higher abundances of mollusca genera such as physa ancylus and potamopyrgus as well as of simulidae oligochaeta and cloeon table 4 analyses of similarities anosim were conducted considering sampling sites sampling campaigns and groundwater and wastewater influence differences in assemblage composition among sampling points were confirmed r 0 362 p 0 001 and were significant between r1 r8 r 0 999 p 0 029 r1 r11 r 0 667 p 0 029 and r8 r11 r 0 537 p 0 029 in contrast r4 and r9 did not present significant differences to the other sampling points when assemblage compositions were compared among sampling campaigns significant differences were obtained r 0 417 p 0 002 showing two distinct groups of samples one composed of spring and summer samples r 0 319 p 0 063 and the other one autumn and winter samples r 0 01 p 0 579 anosim results considering groundwater influence based on the use of incremental stream flow measures showed significant differences between these three groups of samples r 0 213 p 0 029 these differences were significant for nr and l groups r 0 405 p 0 018 and also between nr and g groups r 0 405 p 0 013 however when the classification of sampling points was done according to groundwater influence using emma results differences in assemblage compositions between the two groups were not significant r 0 08 p 0 155 finally when wastewater effects were evaluated considering the threshold of 20 significant differences between the two groups of samples were obtained r 0 207 p 0 029 but in the second case 15 these differences were not significant r 0 107 p 0 110 non parametric multidimensional scaling mds results were in accordance to anosim analysis showing differences between autumn and winter samples group 1 in contrast to spring and summer samples group 2 in fig 6 additionally two other groups could be distinguished group 3 composed of r1 site samples and group 4 containing samples with a wastewater percentage higher than 20 3 3 variation partitioning the variation partitioning was conducted considering different sets of variables that were previously tested and selected to avoid collinearity table 5 in the case of hydrological variables two sets of data were used one including the values of surface water groundwater and wastewater in the stream as l s hdr1 in table 5 and a second one using these data as percentage hdr2 for habitat characteristics the fhi index was used tables 1 and 5 and finally for hydrochemical data two distinct sets of variables were also used a first one included vf1 and vf3 hch1 in table 5 and a second one ec t hco3 cl na k mg2 br no3 and nh4 hch2 results obtained considering the different sets of variables were similar in all the analyses conducted the organism matrix was significantly related to the overall hydrochemical effects and also to the pure hydrochemical effects when hch1 set of variables was considered hydrological data were only significant as overall effects but not as pure effects and finally habitat effects were not significant nor as overall effects neither as pure effects table 5 4 discussion with a total length of only 11 km some distinct human pressures have been detected in the studied reach of the onyar river groundwater withdrawal for agricultural purposes during late spring and summer altered stream hydrology and the main reach of the onyar river became intermittent in some sampling points r8 and r9 and even completely dry downstream in r11 fig 2d menció and mas pla 2010 menció et al 2014 this decrease in stream discharge caused on the one hand changes in habitat characteristics that were depicted by the low fhi index values observed in summer sm2 however low values were also detected during winter campaign due to the effects of other hydrological alteration such as a flooding event in contrast during spring and autumn surveys fhi index presented the highest values on the other hand an increase up to 57 of wastewater proportion in the stream discharge during summer and autumn surveys was caused by the reduction of the stream flow even though the dilution effect of groundwater contributions particularly from r8 to r11 fig 3 and fig 4 in this situation hydrochemical deterioration of stream water could be caused by two distinct sources of pollution treated and non treated waste water effluents red arrows in figs 2 and 3 and no3 polluted groundwater discharge to the stream as base flow figs 1 and 3 menció and mas pla 2008 as it was pointed out through the pca results wastewater pollution was particularly related to high ec values and concentrations of na k cl hco3 and mg2 vf1 in table 2 in contrast groundwater contribution to stream discharge was more related to so4 2 ca2 and br vf2 in table 2 none of these two varifactors were directly linked to nitrogen pollution norg nh4 no2 and no3 since a these nutrients could be detected when both pressures occurred and norg was even negatively associated to groundwater characteristics in vf2 and b nitrogen compounds do not behave as conservative that is norg can be dissimilated to nh4 and then can be oxidized to no2 and finally to no3 under aerobic conditions and additionally most of them can be assimilated by photosynthetic organisms appelo and postma 2005 as regards the effects of all these pressures on community parameters the first sampling point r1 which was not significatively affected by any of the previous pressures showed the highest values for ibmwp ept and sw indexes in most of the sampling campaigns fig 5 in contrast those sampling points directly affected by wastewater discharge r4 and r8 showed the lowest values for these parameters especially r8 which was the sampling point most representative of the effects of wastewater discharge in this stream figs 4 and 6 furthermore r1 showed the highest dissimilarities with the rest of the sampling points particularly with r8 sm3 these dissimilarities were mainly related to the presence in r1 of some ephemeroptera and trichoptera such as habrophlebia caenis and polycentropus taxa more related to good hydrochemical qualities together with the lowest abundances of mollusca in particular ancylus and physa and oligochaeta and simulidae families which had been described as more tolerant to hydrochemical deterioration sm3 berg et al 2018 these results were in accordance to several papers that had determined the negative effects of waste water effluents on stream hydrochemical characteristics and on macroinvertebrate communities carey and migliaccio 2009 lópez doval et al 2013 berger et al 2017 2018 although in some others enhancements in macroinvertebrate assemblages structure have been observed downstream of treated wastewater inputs due to the improvement of these facilities arnon et al 2015 when sampling points were classified according to the proportion of wastewater in stream discharge using emma results no significant differences were observed for community parameters except for ept however dissimilarities between macroinvertebrate assemblages were in accordance to the previous described with some more other taxa some other ephemeroptera baetis showed higher abundances and some mollusca potamopyrgus lower abundances in sampling points non affected by wastewater effluents downstream from r9 to r11 an improvement in ibmwp ept and sw indexes was detected in most of the sampling campaigns even showing higher values than r1 in spring in this specific survey a lower proportion of wastewater was detected thanks to the dilution effect of surface water and particularly to ground water contributions to the stream discharge table 1 fig 2 ibmwp values were significantly higher than the rest of the surveys and particularly r9 and r11 obtained higher values for all the community parameters in comparison to r8 in spite of the increase in nitrate pollution related to these groundwater contributions fig 3 and table 1 when community parameters were analyzed considering groundwater contribution distinct results were observed depending on the methodology used since the groups of samples considered were different for each methodology differences were only significant for ept since the nr group showed higher values than the rest of groups l and g these higher values could be attributed to the high number of r1 samples in nr group making difficult to distinguish whether these differences were caused by the lack of the relationship with the aquifer or the low influence of wastewater inputs into the stream however when community assemblages were compared families of ephemeroptera such as baetis and caenis were more abundant in samples with groundwater influence and simulidae and oligochaeta in those sampling points with a losing stream situation this differences were especially depicted in those sampling points located downstream of wastewater treatment discharges in particular differences in assemblage communities were not only significant for r1 vs r8 but also for r1 vs r11 and r8 vs r11 showing that despite the improvement of community indexes between r8 and r11 the community structure was different from r1 table 4 and sm3 these dissimilarities in community assemblages among r1 r8 and r11 were caused by a an increase in abundances of organisms with a higher tolerance to pollution in sampling point r8 with respect to r1 and a subsequent decrease in r11 oligochaeta physa and helobdella or without a significant diminution in r11 cloeon b a decrease in abundances of some organisms less tolerant to pollution without observing a significant recovery in r11 some trichoptera and ephemeroptera taxa such as polycentropus caenis and habrophlebia c a decrease in abundances of some macroinvertebrates in r8 with a significant increase in r11 baetis and simulidae berger et al 2018 although some authors have reported the negative effects of the chemical quality degradation and the loss of biodiversity caused by nitrate and phosphate high concentrations related to their extended use as fertilizers in agricultural areas camargo et al 2004 weijters et al 2009 theodoropoulus and iliopoulou georgudaki 2010 theodoropoulus et al 2015 in this area groundwater contribution affected by nitrate pollution allowed wastewater dilution and an improvement of community parameters as well as a certain recovery of the community structure however macroinvertebrate assemblages in r1 were significantly dissimilar to r11 with a loss of some taxa linked to high hydrochemical qualities but with a recovery of some other taxa after the dilution of wastewater discharges in addition some of the taxa recovered in r11 were those more adapted to intermittent sites these taxa are less vulnerable to flow reductions since they present better dispersal abilities or flexible life cycles such as baetis garcia et al 2017 finally when the effects of all the different variables hydrology habitat and hydrochemistry on the variability of macroinvertebrate assemblage distribution were analyzed together through variation partitioning analysis results showed that table 5 and fig 6 a habitat characteristics were not significant in any of the distinct tests conducted as pure or overall effects despite the significant differences observed between sampling points and campaigns table 3 in contrast b hydrology was only significant as overall effects and finally c hydrochemical parameters which were mainly related to wastewater and nitrate pollution vf1 and vf3 tables 2 and 5 were significant as both pure and overall effects these results were in accordance to the hydrological and hydrochemical situation of this stream macroinvertebrate assemblages may be affected by the hydrochemical characteristics of the sampling point however these characteristics were linked to the hydrological dynamics since depending on groundwater contribution to the stream flow the stream presented different hydrochemical qualities the effects of flow regime alterations on macroinvertebrates have been widely analyzed e g bond et al 2008 dunbar et al 2010 kakouei et al 2017 under natural conditions some authors have reported some minor differences in faunal composition between perennial and temporary rivers and an overlap between macroinvertebrate assemblages boulton and lake 1992 feminella 1996 del rosario and resh 2000 bonada et al 2007 in contrast others have found significant differences legier and talin 1973 boulton et al 2000 furthermore flow regime alterations caused by human activities such as water regulation have been reported by several authors showing their negative effects on macroinvertebrate communities sharma et al 2005 bredenhand and samways 2009 boix et al 2010 theodoropoulus et al 2015 in particular flow regime alterations caused by groundwater extraction and its effects on macroinvertebrate assemblages have been addressed in some recent studies showing its negative effects in some cases e g kløve et al 2011 bradley et al 2017 white et al 2018 in this study however flow regime alterations caused by groundwater abstraction in the onyar river area have been reported together with hydrochemical quality degradation in this area two distinct sources of pollution have been detected point source pollution caused by wastewater discharges and non point source pollution due to agricultural uses showing that groundwater contribution to the stream flow had a positive effect on stream hydrology and water quality due to its wastewater dilution effect despite its high nitrate concentrations acknowledgments this study has been funded by the projects cgl2014 57215 c4 2 r cgl 2016 76024

6962,mediterranean rivers are affected by natural disturbances and human pressures which may alter their hydrology water quality and habitat structure in this study an analysis of macroinvertebrates community structure has been used to determine how distinct human pressures such as point and non point sources of pollution together with groundwater withdrawal may affect these ecosystems a total of 4 sampling campaigns were conducted in the middle reach of the onyar river ne spain which was affected by agricultural and urban uses stream discharge and physicochemical parameters were measured in situ and water samples and macroinvertebrates assemblages were taken and properly preserved for subsequent analysis and identification variation partitioning showed that macroinvertebrate community structure was particularly dependent on hydrochemical characteristics but also on hydrological variations in addition results indicated that groundwater withdrawal altered stream hydrology and the main reach of the onyar river became intermittent and even completely dry in downstream positions this reduction on stream discharge caused changes in habitat characteristics as well as in the proportion of wastewater some wastewater dilution occurred linked to groundwater with high nitrate concentrations inputs to the stream and even though the macroinvertebrate community recovered its quality in some sampling campaigns it presented a different structure than in sampling points not affected by any of these pressures therefore the approach here used to analyze the hydrological effects on macroinvertebrate communities allowed us to determine their influence on hydrochemical and habitat characteristics keywords hydrological alterations groundwater exploitation point source pollution non point source pollution macroinvertebrate community 1 introduction mediterranean rivers are characterized by a variable flow regime with dry summers and winters and rainy springs and autumns these ecosystems show seasonal and predictable disturbances such as floods and droughts bonada et al 2007 and may be characterized by four different general flow categories according to boulton et al 2000 1 ephemeral flow briefly with irregular timing 1 month and usually only after unpredictable rain has fallen 2 intermittent or temporary streams flow for longer periods 1 3 months regularly have an annual dry period coinciding with prolonged dry weather 3 semi permanent streams flow most of the year but cease flow during dry weather 3 months drying to pools and 4 permanent streams with perennial flow except for rare extreme droughts however these ecosystems may be affected by different kinds of pressures which may alter stream hydrology water quality and habitat structure e g allan 2004 theodoropoulus et al 2015 pressures on water quality can be classified according to their origin urban and industrial wastewater discharges whether treated or not can be considered as a point type pressure that modifies surface water hydrochemistry in addition streams may be affected by non point source pollution caused by surface and subsurface runoff from croplands and urban areas which is seasonal and highly affected by climate variability land use may not only affect stream water quality but also hydrology and habitat structure in mediterranean areas alterations on flow regime caused by water regulation direct extractions or groundwater overexploitation reduce the quality of water as well as its availability to support a functional aquatic ecosystem miller et al 1989 sánchez and schmidt 2012 benejam et al 2010 menció et al 2014 therefore these alterations may enhance the effects of droughts in these ecosystems depending on duration of dry periods and the basin and reach characteristics drought intensity may range from declines in discharge below average baseflow levels to intermittency and even to total drying of the river channel with increasing effects for the biota e g pires et al 1999 rincón and cressa 2000 boulton 2003 magoulick and kobza 2003 hakala and hartman 2004 davey and kelly 2007 benejam et al 2010 boix et al 2010 tornés and ruhí 2013 stubbington et al 2018 streams and rivers in the mediterranean basin that were compatible with agricultural activity for thousands of years are now clearly negatively affected by current intensive agriculture and other human activities such as industry channelization construction of dams or settlement growth hooke 2006 terrado et al 2014 water quality was affected but also habitat and hydrologic alteration has been widely reported e g benejam et al 2010 belmar et al 2013 merciai et al 2017 moreover mediterranean climate increases the water abstraction concern due to his characteristic period of dry weather and high temperatures which imply large water level fluctuations gasith and resh 1999 bolle 2003 these impacts on hydrochemistry hydrology and habitat connote changes in community population structure and even species survival e g rubio gracia et al 2017 merciai et al 2018 mor et al 2018 macroinvertebrates are for a long time widely used in order to evaluate water quality and ecosystem health especially in lotic ecosystems hellawell 1986 metcalfe 1989 therefore advantages and difficulties of using macroinvertebrates with these goals arewell known rosenberg and resh 1993 moreover various technical developments such as indices have enabled macroinvertebrates to be used advantageously in biomonitoring programs e g wright et al 2000 camargo et al 2004 munné and prat 2009 in these sense it is important to underly that the structure of macroinvertebrate assemblages have been related to hydrochemistry hydrology and habitat changes jointly or separately in many zones graczyk 1993 poff et al 2010 wilding et al 2018 including mediterranean areas e g acuña et al 2005 bonada et al 2006 boix et al 2010 benetti et al 2012 garcia et al 2017 according to the european water framework directive wfd directive 2000 60 ec ec 2000 european countries are under the obligation to protect natural water bodies from environmental and hydrological deterioration and while meeting this requirements insure water supplies for human needs in order to achieve this goal management decisions should not worsen the ecological status of these water bodies and should be based on a good knowledge of the hydrogeological processes and dynamics that maintain river discharge in a previous work menció et al 2014 we analyzed the stream aquifer relationship in the onyar river watershed comparing different methodologies the aim of this new study is to analyze how distinct human pressures point and non point sources of pollution together with groundwater withdrawal may affect macroinvertebrates community based on the previous results groundwater exploitation modifies flow regimes and streams run unusually low changing habitats in a process called lentification sabater 2008 additionally due to this decrease in stream flow a lower dilution of treated and untreated wastewater discharges occurs worsening stream water quality finally nitrate groundwater pollution may affect stream quality during gaining stream situations this scenario offered the opportunity to analyze the effects of hydrology on habitats water and macroinvertebrates community characteristics we hypothesized that hydrological changes i e changes on flow regime would affect seasonal and longitudinal macroinvertebrates community distribution moreover in those areas where human pressures are relevant hydrological patterns determine water quality that in turn determines the composition of macroinvertebrate community therefore hydrological effects over macroinvertebrate community would not only be caused directly by changes in habitat characteristics but also indirectly by water quality specifically the objectives of this study are 1 to determine the effects of hydrology on habitats and stream water quality 2 to assess the role of hydrology on macroinvertebrate assemblages in anthropized environments and 3 to assess which measures of community structure and quality could describe better the impacts related to hydrology modification from a management point of view 1 1 study area the onyar river watershed has an area of 295 km2 and is located in the selva tectonic depression about 100 km ne of barcelona ne spain fig 1 this watershed is a smallest one if we take into account that other catalan watersheds achieved to 10 16 times greater areas this is the case of the llobregat river watershed with a surface of 4950 km2 and also its main stream the ter river watershed with an area of 3010 km2 the study area has a mediterranean climate with a mean annual precipitation of 695 9 168 7 l m2 and a mean temperature of 14 3 0 7 c for the 1950 2011 period catalan meteorological service http www meteo cat the onyar river presents a mean flow of 1 59 1 22 m3 s and a minimum monthly flow of 0 46 m3 s in summer for the 1959 2011 period catalan water agency aca http aca gencat cat the onyar river drainage network is controlled by quaternary tectonic activity that force their way towards the north fig 1 as well as by recent streambed deepening and channeling conducted to enhance rainfall peak runoff and allow groundwater draining in the central low gradient areas of the basin until its confluence with the ter river as a result the stream channel is 35 4 6 3 m wide and 4 8 0 9 m depth in the whole studied area and the average water depth observed in the distinct sampling locations ranged from 0 095 0 036 m to 0 163 0 096 m during the studied period the alluvial deposits of the onyar river are well developed along the main stream downstream of r1 sampling point in fig 1 and are composed of fine sand layers with a high content of silt and clay especially near the surface and with layers of coarse sand and gravel in some specific areas streambed sediments are mainly gravel and sand between r1 and r4 locations and gravel sand and clay downstream from r5 to r12 in fig 1 the maximum thickness of alluvial deposits is of 15 m approx constituting a significant groundwater reservoir and allowing effective base flow control during dry seasons under no exploitation conditions mas pla et al 1985 folch et al 2011 menció et al 2014 this area has been affected by several human pressures which modify stream flow and surface and groundwater water quality folch et al 2011 menció and mas pla 2008 2010 menció et al 2014 with a total population of 137 510 inhabitants this watershed has an intensive agricultural and livestock production slurry and manure produced by husbandry activities are used as the main fertilizer for crops and synthetic fertilizers are also applied puig et al 2013 up to 40 5 of the agricultural land 4700 ha approx is irrigated using groundwater supply with sprinkler irrigation for arable crops and drip irrigation in orchards darp 2017 this intense groundwater exploitation for agriculture purposes from may to october causes severe head level downward capturing the stream flow and drying up the main stream therefore treated waste water effluents and waste water discharges with low or null treatment in isolated housing areas also affect the onyar river consequently this area has been classified as a nitrate vulnerable zone nvz as a result of the transposition of the nitrate directive nd 91 676 ec therefore nitrate concentrations in groundwater are higher than 50 mg no3 l in most of the boreholes fig 1 menció et al 2012 2014 puig et al 2013 the studied reach of the onyar river in this work has a total length of 11 km and it is located in its middle course between the municipalities of vilobí d onyar sant dalmai village and riudellots de la selva fig 1 in this sector the alluvial aquifer presents a total area of 12 km2 and a maximum depth of 15 m in its central part this reach is located just before the confluence of one of its main tributaries the rest of the tributaries in this area were dry during the studied period and the main course received waste water without treatment from sant dalmai sewage network and inputs from the vilobí d onyar waste water treatment plant ca 3000 inhabitants ww1 and ww2 respectively in fig 1 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling ten sampling points were selected at variable distances to track discharge changes related to stream aquifer exchange or waste water treatment plant inputs along the onyar river r1 r2 r4 r5 r7 r8 r9 r10 r11 and r12 in fig 1 during field campaigns conducted in november 2010 autumn february 2011 winter may 2011 spring and july 2011 summer discharge was recorded in all of them using the mechanical current meter method the stream channel cross section was divided in numerous vertical subsections at intervals of 0 30 0 50 m stream flow velocity was determined using a current meter at each subsection and discharge in each of them was computed by multiplying the subsection area by the measured velocity the total discharge was computed summing the discharge of each subsection additionally stream water samples were taken in these sites for hydrochemical analysis after filtration 0 45 μm samples were acidified in the field for cation determination and stored in a fridge at 4 c in a dark environment for subsequent analyses physicochemical parameters were measured in situ using a crison cm35 portable conductivity meter with a temperature measurement capability to determine water temperature and electrical conductivity ec accuracy ec 0 5 temperature 0 2 c ph and eh were also measured in situ with a wtw 330i ph mv meter accuracy ph 0 003 ph eh 0 2 mv and dissolved oxygen was measured with a crison oxi45p portable meter accuracy do 0 5 macroinvertebrates were collected at r1 r4 r8 r9 and r11 sampling sites using a surber sampler of 0 1 m2 surface area with 500 μm mesh net samples were collected using the quantitative method of hering et al 2004 adapted to mediterranean rivers boix et al 2010 consisted in sampling 12 subsamples collected according to the relative abundance of the potential substratum type the considered substrata were bryophytes submerged hydrophytes helophytes algae submerged roots coarse particulate organic matter flat bedrock boulders 256 mm cobbles and coarse gravel 25 256 mm gravels 2 25 mm coarse and medium sands 2 mm and fine sands to lutite 0 1 mm in every sampling site eight substrata were sampled in the dominant 5 and four in the marginal 5 substrata the 12 subsamples were merged in one sample then preserved with 4 formaldehyde stored and identified in the laboratory 2 2 water and macroinvertebrate analysis alkalinity as hco3 was determined using gran titration their inter day average precision with percent relative standard deviation rsd was 1 nitrogen as total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn ammonium nh4 nitrites no2 and nitrates no3 was analyzed according to apha 2005 with a rsd of 1 2 8 2 8 and 2 4 respectively organic nitrogen was determined by difference of tkn with the ammonium nitrogen cl po4 3 and so4 2 using capillary electrophoresis with indirect uv detection with a rsd of 2 9 and 2 2 and ca2 mg2 na and k using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icpaes with a rsd of 7 0 1 1 3 6 and 1 1 respectively bromide was analyzed by icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry rsd of 1 9 the quality of the chemical analysis was checked performing the ionic mass balance with all samples showing an error lower than 5 macroinvertebrate taxa were identified at genus level under a motic smz 168 bl zoom stereo microscope 50 magnification except for diptera and platyhelminthes that were identified at family level and oligochaeta that were identified at subclass level using tachet et al 2000 2 3 environmental variables in order to determine the hydrological habitat and hydrochemical effects on macroinvertebrate community distinct indicators and sets of variables have been considered hydrologic characteristics of the distinct sampling points were previously determined in menció et al 2014 for the present analysis three different variables were considered a the proportion of surface water groundwater and waste water in l s for each sampling point determined through an end member mixing analyses emma christophersen et al 1990 mas pla et al 2013 b the proportion of surface water groundwater and waste water in for each sampling point determined through emma and c the incremental stream flow measure harvey and wagner 2000 the last approach states that any change downstream in volumetric discharge in a reach without tributaries is due to water fluxes across the streambed and thus net groundwater fluxes can be computed as the differences between stream flows and successive cross sections when the difference in discharge between a sampling point and the previous one was positive a gaining stream situation was assumed g in contrast when the result was negative a losing stream situation was considered l and finally when the value was 0 a non relationship situation was considered nr in contrast with emma approach sampling points were classified according to their percentage of groundwater contribution using a threshold of 20 or wastewater contribution considering two thresholds of 15 and 20 of wastewater to the stream discharge habitat characteristics were determined using the percentage of the 12 substrata types defined in the previous section as well as the fluvial habitat index fhi index for mediterranean streams described by pardo et al 2002 hydrochemical characteristics were considered using the parameters described in the previous section as well as using the results of a principal component analysis pca considering all these data the pca was performed in order to identify associations between variables since the resulting varifactors are usually adequate to indicate the influence of seasonal or human factors on hydrochemical processes e g helena et al 2000 menció and mas pla 2008 finally a matrix based on macroinvertebrate data was created this matrix contained the hellinger transformation square root transformation of the abundances individuals of each assemblage according to the taxonomic level described previously in order to express the data as relative abundances bocard et al 2011 additionally different community parameters such as shannon wiener diversity index sw the total number of different ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera taxa as ept the total number of odonata coleoptera and hemiptera as och bonada et al 2007 and the iberian bio monitoring working party index ibmwp index munné and prat 2009 were also calculated 2 4 data analysis when hydrological habitat and community variables were normally distributed anova f dependent samples t tests for sampling periods and independent samples t test were conducted to identify relationships among groups of samples otherwise non parametric tests were used mann whitney u test and kruskal wallis h test as stated in the previous section a principal component analysis has been conducted to identify associations between hydrochemical parameters that could indicate the influence of seasonal dynamics human factors hydrochemical processes or the origin of stream discharge and also to reduce the number of variables for the variation partitioning the dataset considered for this analysis included all the hydrochemical variables determined ec ph eh t do hco3 cl so4 2 br ca2 mg2 na k po4 2 nh4 no2 no3 and norg in contrast to the previous study conducted by menció et al 2014 in this analysis only surface water samples were considered the comparison of macroinvertebrate assemblages between sampling points seasons and the influence of wastewater or groundwater in the stream discharge was performed by means of anosim analyses clarke and warwick 2001 anosim operates on a resemblance matrix and is similar to a standard univariate anova but does not require normality or homoscedasticity of data similarity percentages simper tests were also used to determine the assemblage similarity between sampling points seasons and groundwater and wastewater influence in the stream non parametric multidimensional scaling mds was performed in the onyar river samples to analyze the relationship between macroinvertebrate community structure with respect to their location along the stream reach analyzed taxa abundances were square root transformed and bray curtis was selected as a similarity distance anosim and simper tests mds and calculations of the assemblage parameters were performed by primer v 6 0 for windows additionally the effects of hydrological variables hydrochemcial conditions and habitat characteristics on the different biotic components were also analyzed by means of variation partitioning bocard et al 1992 legendre and legendre 1998 using the vegan package oksanen et al 2009 of r language r development core team 2008 variation partitioning was here used to decompose the variation of dependent variables in unique or pure and shared or joint effects of a set of predictors it is achieved by partial regression and redundancy analysis for multiple dependent variables square root transformed genus or family matrices according to peres neto et al 2006 the vegan package primarily uses adjusted r squares to assess the partitions explained by the predictors and their combinations three sets of predictors were considered including hydrological hdr hydrochemical hch and habitat hab variables the variation was decomposed in the following components pure hydrological effects hdr hab hch pure hydrochemical effects hch hab hdr and habitat effects hab hdr hch since the explanatory datasets predictors are generally not orthogonal to one another some variation was explained jointly non hydrological habitat hydrochemical effects hab hch hdr non habitat hydrological hydrochemical effects hdr hch hab non hydrochemical habitat hydrological effects hab hdr hch hydrological joint habitat hydrochemical effects hdr hab hch and finally the unexplained variation 1 hdr hab hch the overall effects unique plus shared with other components of habitat hydrochemical and hydrological effects were also reported a redundancy analysis rda was conducted previously to the variation partitioning in order to avoid collinearity and to select an appropriate group of variables for each predictor hab hdr and hch all the variables described in the previous section characterization of variables were considered for rda with a previous transformation concentrations of the different hydrochemical parameters except for ph and water flow were log10 transformed whereas the percentage estimates were arcsine transformed according to legendre and legendre 1998 however scores obtained from pca were not transformed 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal patterns of environmental variables variability of hydrological hydrochemical and habitat variables among sampling sites and campaigns were analyzed 3 1 1 hydrological characterization in fig 2 the distribution of the different sources of stream discharge classified as surface water groundwater and wastewater has been represented for all sampling campaigns based on menció et al 2014 the onyar river was not a permanent stream due to the capture of its flow during the summer season fig 2d table 1 this situation was caused by groundwater withdrawal for agricultural purposes and the continuous flow in the main stream was not recovered until significant precipitations occur in autumn therefore during summer season the stream was intermittent from r8 to r9 and completely dry in r11 fig 2d upstream of r1 sampling site there was not nor an extensive alluvial aquifer neither any waste water discharge for this reason the only source of water considered in r1 was surface water downstream the studied reach of the onyar river received two continuous wastewater discharges before sampling points r4 and r8 fig 2 and table 1 and thus the proportion of wastewater in the stream flow increased from 13 to 20 in winter and spring february 2011 and may 2011 to 24 57 in summer and autumn july 2011 and november 2010 in r8 r9 and r11 sites due to the lower contribution of surface water and groundwater to the stream discharge fig 2 these differences between the amount of wastewater in l s in the different sampling points were not significant nor for sampling sites h 7 693 df 4 p 0 104 neither for sampling campaigns h 5 249 df 3 p 0 154 but when wastewater values were considered as a percentage significant differences were detected between r1 and the rest of the sampling points f 3 876 df 4 p 0 025 finally the proportion of groundwater contribution to the stream flow varied depending on the sampling survey the lowest values were detected in winter february 2011 when a bank storage return situation was observed menció et al 2014 in the rest of the surveys groundwater contribution was between 27 and 40 of the stream flow in r8 r9 and r11 reaching up to 76 in r9 during the summer campaign when this sampling site was isolated from the rest due to the loss of the continuous flow fig 2 although these variations were not significant h 3 235 df 3 p 0 357 between sampling surveys when groundwater contribution was compared between sampling sites some significant differences were depicted this was the case of r1 and r8 r9 and r11 and also between r4 and r9 and r11 h 11 272 df 4 0 024 3 1 2 hydrochemical characterization in fig 3 nitrogen distribution as norg nh4 n no2 n and no3 n is represented for the different sampling points and campaigns when fig 3 is compared to fig 2 the most significant inputs of nitrogen are not only detected after waste water effluents but also when groundwater contribution was observed this situation is particularly depicted between r9 and r11 where an increase in no3 n was observed in most of the sampling campaigns together with a stream flow increase results of pca are shown in table 2 a total of 6 varifactors vf were obtained with eigenvalues over 1 explaining the 89 2 of the total variance after a varimax rotation the final vfs were interpreted as follows fig 3 vf1 included variables as na k cl hco3 mg2 and ec and others with a lower participation such as ca2 and br this vf represents the influence of waste water effluents since the samples that obtained the highest scores were those located downstream of waste water discharge points r4 r8 and r9 especially in summer campaigns figs 2 and 4 the variables with significant positive loadings for vf2 were so4 2 ca2 and br and norg and o2 obtained significant negative loadings this second vf is interpreted as groundwater contribution since the samples with higher scores for vf2 were those with percentages of groundwater in stream discharge higher than 24 and up to 76 r8 r9 and r11 figs 2 3 and table 1 finally vf3 vf4 vf5 and vf6 were those varifactors with a percentage of explained variance lower than 15 but associated to nutrients fig 4 vf3 was mainly linked to temperature but also to low no3 and nh4 content samples with the lowest scores for this vf were those linked to nitrate pollution in particular samples from r11 r9 r8 and r4 in autumn and winter campaigns when groundwater inputs into the stream were higher contrarily samples with the highest scores for vf3 were r1 r8 r9 in summer and r9 in spring part of these sampling points was isolated in these campaigns and their low no3 and nh4 concentrations were linked to nitrogen assimilation by photosynthetic organisms in the case of vf4 it presents a negative loading for po4 3 together with positive loadings for o2 ph linking the conditions that make possible the presence of po4 3 in the study area and depicting the sampling points where po4 3 was detected mainly in r4 r8 and r9 table 1 vf5 was associated to the presence of nh4 in this stream the main source of this compound is wastewater since the highest concentrations of ammonia were detected in wastewater discharges with mean values of 15 33 mg l finally vf6 was related to the presence of no2 in this case the two samples with the highest scores were r4 and r8 the only samples that showed some no2 in solution in spring due to the low presence of this compound in the study samples it is not possible to link its presence to any particular origin or process 3 1 3 habitat characteristics in table 3 habitat characteristics of the different sampling points have been represented according to these results when sampling sites characteristics were compared significant differences in the presence of bryophytes h 12 574 df 4 p 0 014 boulders h 15 031 df 4 p 0 005 and cobbles and coarse gravel were detected h 11 760 df 4 p 0 019 these differences were caused by a higher presence of bryophytes and boulders in r1 than in the rest of the sampling points and the higher proportions of cobbles and coarse gravel in r1 and r4 than in the rest of the sampling points besides temporal differences were observed when sampling campaigns were compared especially for the presence of logs and debris in the river bed h 10 537 df 3 p 0 015 additionally significant differences were observed for fhi values between sampling points f 7 353 df 4 p 0 002 and also for sampling campaigns these differences were significant due to the distinct values of r1 in comparison to the rest of the sampling points and for the lower values of fhi in winter and summer than in autumn and spring campaigns t 3 845 df 3 p 0 001 t 16 743 df 4 p 0 031 the lowest values during winter were caused by a flooding event and in summer due to the loss of stream discharge caused by groundwater withdrawal table 1 3 2 community parameters and assemblage variation in order to analyze the effects of human pressures on macroinvertebrates community different variables together with the comparison of macroinvertebrate assemblages have been determined these community variables here used were 1 the shannon wiener diversity index sw 2 the total number of ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera taxa as ept representative of lotic environments 3 the total number of odonata coleoptera and hemiptera as och organisms representative of lentic environments and finally 4 the ibmwp index iberian bio monitoring working party used to assess the ecological status of the iberian mediterranean rivers results of macroinvertebrate assemblages and community variables have been presented in sm1 table 4 and fig 5 these variables were analyzed considering a sampling points b sampling campaigns c groundwater influence and d wastewater influence a when sampling points were considered r1 was the sampling station with the highest values for ibmwp ept and shannon wiener sw diversity in most of the sampling campaigns sm1 fig 5 downstream a progressive decrease in these parameters was observed reaching the lowest values in r8 in all sampling campaigns finally certain recovery occurred in r9 and r11 stations especially in spring campaign these differences between sampling points were significant for ept h 11 012 df 4 p 0 026 but not for och f 0 058 df 4 p 0 993 ibmwp f 1 10 df 4 p 0 393 and sw diversity f 1 46 df 4 p 0 267 r1 showed the highest dissimilarities in macroinvertebrate assemblages with the rest of the sampling stations these dissimilarities were mainly caused by the constant presence of habrophlebia caenis polycentropus in this first sampling station together with the lowest abundances of ancylus physa and oligochaeta and simulidae families sm1 and sm3 in contrast the lowest dissimilarities were obtained between r4 and r8 the two sampling points located after waste water discharges in this case dissimilarity was mainly caused by higher abundances of caenis baetis and simulidae in r4 and lower abundances of cloeon and oligochaeta sm1 and sm3 b in contrast differences between sampling campaigns were significant for the ibmwp index f 5 93 df 3 p 0 007 due to differences between spring and winter campaigns t 3 63 df 4 p 0 022 and between spring and autumn campaigns t 5 70 df 4 p 0 005 showing the highest values of ibmwp in spring campaign in addition significant differences were observed for och f 10 653 df 3 p 0 001 showing lower values in autumn and winter than in spring campaign t 2 988 df 4 p 0 040 and t 3 266 df 3 p 0 047 and also lower och values in autumn than in summer t 4 190 df 4 p 0 014 when macroinvertebrate assemblages were compared considering sampling campaigns the highest dissimilarities were observed between summer july 2011 and autumn november 2010 summer and winter february 2011 and between spring may 2011 and autumn campaigns table 4 these differences were caused due to the higher abundances of oligochaeta and simulidae in autumn and winter campaigns and the lower abundances of baetis caenis ephemerella ancylus physa and galba c groundwater influence was tested using two distinct methodologies for classification the first one was the use of incremental stream flow measures to classify each sampling point according to its relationship with the alluvial aquifer considering the three groups of samples obtained with a gaining stream situation g a losing stream situation l or without relationship nr significant differences were only observed when ept data were compared h 7 584 df 2 p 0 023 showing nr the greatest numbers when samples classification was conducted taking into account the percentage of groundwater obtained in the emma two groups of samples were distinguished a first group was composed of those samples with a groundwater percentage higher than 20 of their discharge and the second one with those with a lower influence tables 1 and 4 using this second methodology no differences were obtained for composition parameters between these two groups of sampling points the highest dissimilarities between macroinvertebrate assemblages were observed between nr and g and between nr and l groups table 4 these dissimilarities were associated to higher abundances of habrophlebia caenis and polycentropus in nr group sampling point r1 and r9 in summer season and lower values for cloeon baetis physa and also simulidae and oligochaeta in contrast to nr group samples of g and i groups were located downstream of wastewater plants mainly from r4 r8 r9 and r11 sampling stations and when these two groups were compared differences between them were also detected in this case dissimilarities were caused by higher abundances in group g of baetis caenis and cloeon and lower values of simulidae oligochaeta and ancylus when groundwater influence was analyzed considering emma results dissimilarities were caused by higher abundances of habrophlebia caenis baetis and physa and lower abundances of cloeon simulidae and oligochaeta in sampling points with groundwater influence d additionally in order to consider wastewater influence two distinct classifications were also taken into account the first one considering as a threshold a 20 of wastewater composition in stream discharge and the second one considering only a 15 based on emma values of table 1 in this analysis no differences were obtained for none of the composition parameters except for ept u 18 500 p 0 033 considering a 15 of wastewater and for ept with u 13 000 and p 0 022 considering a 20 of wastewater in stream discharge composition showing the greatest numbers of ept in those sampling points with low wastewater influence in both cases dissimilarities between macroinvertebrate assemblages caused by wastewater influence suppose lower abundances of most of ephemeroptera genera observed baetis caenis and habrophlebia but higher abundances of mollusca genera such as physa ancylus and potamopyrgus as well as of simulidae oligochaeta and cloeon table 4 analyses of similarities anosim were conducted considering sampling sites sampling campaigns and groundwater and wastewater influence differences in assemblage composition among sampling points were confirmed r 0 362 p 0 001 and were significant between r1 r8 r 0 999 p 0 029 r1 r11 r 0 667 p 0 029 and r8 r11 r 0 537 p 0 029 in contrast r4 and r9 did not present significant differences to the other sampling points when assemblage compositions were compared among sampling campaigns significant differences were obtained r 0 417 p 0 002 showing two distinct groups of samples one composed of spring and summer samples r 0 319 p 0 063 and the other one autumn and winter samples r 0 01 p 0 579 anosim results considering groundwater influence based on the use of incremental stream flow measures showed significant differences between these three groups of samples r 0 213 p 0 029 these differences were significant for nr and l groups r 0 405 p 0 018 and also between nr and g groups r 0 405 p 0 013 however when the classification of sampling points was done according to groundwater influence using emma results differences in assemblage compositions between the two groups were not significant r 0 08 p 0 155 finally when wastewater effects were evaluated considering the threshold of 20 significant differences between the two groups of samples were obtained r 0 207 p 0 029 but in the second case 15 these differences were not significant r 0 107 p 0 110 non parametric multidimensional scaling mds results were in accordance to anosim analysis showing differences between autumn and winter samples group 1 in contrast to spring and summer samples group 2 in fig 6 additionally two other groups could be distinguished group 3 composed of r1 site samples and group 4 containing samples with a wastewater percentage higher than 20 3 3 variation partitioning the variation partitioning was conducted considering different sets of variables that were previously tested and selected to avoid collinearity table 5 in the case of hydrological variables two sets of data were used one including the values of surface water groundwater and wastewater in the stream as l s hdr1 in table 5 and a second one using these data as percentage hdr2 for habitat characteristics the fhi index was used tables 1 and 5 and finally for hydrochemical data two distinct sets of variables were also used a first one included vf1 and vf3 hch1 in table 5 and a second one ec t hco3 cl na k mg2 br no3 and nh4 hch2 results obtained considering the different sets of variables were similar in all the analyses conducted the organism matrix was significantly related to the overall hydrochemical effects and also to the pure hydrochemical effects when hch1 set of variables was considered hydrological data were only significant as overall effects but not as pure effects and finally habitat effects were not significant nor as overall effects neither as pure effects table 5 4 discussion with a total length of only 11 km some distinct human pressures have been detected in the studied reach of the onyar river groundwater withdrawal for agricultural purposes during late spring and summer altered stream hydrology and the main reach of the onyar river became intermittent in some sampling points r8 and r9 and even completely dry downstream in r11 fig 2d menció and mas pla 2010 menció et al 2014 this decrease in stream discharge caused on the one hand changes in habitat characteristics that were depicted by the low fhi index values observed in summer sm2 however low values were also detected during winter campaign due to the effects of other hydrological alteration such as a flooding event in contrast during spring and autumn surveys fhi index presented the highest values on the other hand an increase up to 57 of wastewater proportion in the stream discharge during summer and autumn surveys was caused by the reduction of the stream flow even though the dilution effect of groundwater contributions particularly from r8 to r11 fig 3 and fig 4 in this situation hydrochemical deterioration of stream water could be caused by two distinct sources of pollution treated and non treated waste water effluents red arrows in figs 2 and 3 and no3 polluted groundwater discharge to the stream as base flow figs 1 and 3 menció and mas pla 2008 as it was pointed out through the pca results wastewater pollution was particularly related to high ec values and concentrations of na k cl hco3 and mg2 vf1 in table 2 in contrast groundwater contribution to stream discharge was more related to so4 2 ca2 and br vf2 in table 2 none of these two varifactors were directly linked to nitrogen pollution norg nh4 no2 and no3 since a these nutrients could be detected when both pressures occurred and norg was even negatively associated to groundwater characteristics in vf2 and b nitrogen compounds do not behave as conservative that is norg can be dissimilated to nh4 and then can be oxidized to no2 and finally to no3 under aerobic conditions and additionally most of them can be assimilated by photosynthetic organisms appelo and postma 2005 as regards the effects of all these pressures on community parameters the first sampling point r1 which was not significatively affected by any of the previous pressures showed the highest values for ibmwp ept and sw indexes in most of the sampling campaigns fig 5 in contrast those sampling points directly affected by wastewater discharge r4 and r8 showed the lowest values for these parameters especially r8 which was the sampling point most representative of the effects of wastewater discharge in this stream figs 4 and 6 furthermore r1 showed the highest dissimilarities with the rest of the sampling points particularly with r8 sm3 these dissimilarities were mainly related to the presence in r1 of some ephemeroptera and trichoptera such as habrophlebia caenis and polycentropus taxa more related to good hydrochemical qualities together with the lowest abundances of mollusca in particular ancylus and physa and oligochaeta and simulidae families which had been described as more tolerant to hydrochemical deterioration sm3 berg et al 2018 these results were in accordance to several papers that had determined the negative effects of waste water effluents on stream hydrochemical characteristics and on macroinvertebrate communities carey and migliaccio 2009 lópez doval et al 2013 berger et al 2017 2018 although in some others enhancements in macroinvertebrate assemblages structure have been observed downstream of treated wastewater inputs due to the improvement of these facilities arnon et al 2015 when sampling points were classified according to the proportion of wastewater in stream discharge using emma results no significant differences were observed for community parameters except for ept however dissimilarities between macroinvertebrate assemblages were in accordance to the previous described with some more other taxa some other ephemeroptera baetis showed higher abundances and some mollusca potamopyrgus lower abundances in sampling points non affected by wastewater effluents downstream from r9 to r11 an improvement in ibmwp ept and sw indexes was detected in most of the sampling campaigns even showing higher values than r1 in spring in this specific survey a lower proportion of wastewater was detected thanks to the dilution effect of surface water and particularly to ground water contributions to the stream discharge table 1 fig 2 ibmwp values were significantly higher than the rest of the surveys and particularly r9 and r11 obtained higher values for all the community parameters in comparison to r8 in spite of the increase in nitrate pollution related to these groundwater contributions fig 3 and table 1 when community parameters were analyzed considering groundwater contribution distinct results were observed depending on the methodology used since the groups of samples considered were different for each methodology differences were only significant for ept since the nr group showed higher values than the rest of groups l and g these higher values could be attributed to the high number of r1 samples in nr group making difficult to distinguish whether these differences were caused by the lack of the relationship with the aquifer or the low influence of wastewater inputs into the stream however when community assemblages were compared families of ephemeroptera such as baetis and caenis were more abundant in samples with groundwater influence and simulidae and oligochaeta in those sampling points with a losing stream situation this differences were especially depicted in those sampling points located downstream of wastewater treatment discharges in particular differences in assemblage communities were not only significant for r1 vs r8 but also for r1 vs r11 and r8 vs r11 showing that despite the improvement of community indexes between r8 and r11 the community structure was different from r1 table 4 and sm3 these dissimilarities in community assemblages among r1 r8 and r11 were caused by a an increase in abundances of organisms with a higher tolerance to pollution in sampling point r8 with respect to r1 and a subsequent decrease in r11 oligochaeta physa and helobdella or without a significant diminution in r11 cloeon b a decrease in abundances of some organisms less tolerant to pollution without observing a significant recovery in r11 some trichoptera and ephemeroptera taxa such as polycentropus caenis and habrophlebia c a decrease in abundances of some macroinvertebrates in r8 with a significant increase in r11 baetis and simulidae berger et al 2018 although some authors have reported the negative effects of the chemical quality degradation and the loss of biodiversity caused by nitrate and phosphate high concentrations related to their extended use as fertilizers in agricultural areas camargo et al 2004 weijters et al 2009 theodoropoulus and iliopoulou georgudaki 2010 theodoropoulus et al 2015 in this area groundwater contribution affected by nitrate pollution allowed wastewater dilution and an improvement of community parameters as well as a certain recovery of the community structure however macroinvertebrate assemblages in r1 were significantly dissimilar to r11 with a loss of some taxa linked to high hydrochemical qualities but with a recovery of some other taxa after the dilution of wastewater discharges in addition some of the taxa recovered in r11 were those more adapted to intermittent sites these taxa are less vulnerable to flow reductions since they present better dispersal abilities or flexible life cycles such as baetis garcia et al 2017 finally when the effects of all the different variables hydrology habitat and hydrochemistry on the variability of macroinvertebrate assemblage distribution were analyzed together through variation partitioning analysis results showed that table 5 and fig 6 a habitat characteristics were not significant in any of the distinct tests conducted as pure or overall effects despite the significant differences observed between sampling points and campaigns table 3 in contrast b hydrology was only significant as overall effects and finally c hydrochemical parameters which were mainly related to wastewater and nitrate pollution vf1 and vf3 tables 2 and 5 were significant as both pure and overall effects these results were in accordance to the hydrological and hydrochemical situation of this stream macroinvertebrate assemblages may be affected by the hydrochemical characteristics of the sampling point however these characteristics were linked to the hydrological dynamics since depending on groundwater contribution to the stream flow the stream presented different hydrochemical qualities the effects of flow regime alterations on macroinvertebrates have been widely analyzed e g bond et al 2008 dunbar et al 2010 kakouei et al 2017 under natural conditions some authors have reported some minor differences in faunal composition between perennial and temporary rivers and an overlap between macroinvertebrate assemblages boulton and lake 1992 feminella 1996 del rosario and resh 2000 bonada et al 2007 in contrast others have found significant differences legier and talin 1973 boulton et al 2000 furthermore flow regime alterations caused by human activities such as water regulation have been reported by several authors showing their negative effects on macroinvertebrate communities sharma et al 2005 bredenhand and samways 2009 boix et al 2010 theodoropoulus et al 2015 in particular flow regime alterations caused by groundwater extraction and its effects on macroinvertebrate assemblages have been addressed in some recent studies showing its negative effects in some cases e g kløve et al 2011 bradley et al 2017 white et al 2018 in this study however flow regime alterations caused by groundwater abstraction in the onyar river area have been reported together with hydrochemical quality degradation in this area two distinct sources of pollution have been detected point source pollution caused by wastewater discharges and non point source pollution due to agricultural uses showing that groundwater contribution to the stream flow had a positive effect on stream hydrology and water quality due to its wastewater dilution effect despite its high nitrate concentrations acknowledgments this study has been funded by the projects cgl2014 57215 c4 2 r cgl 2016 76024

6963,this paper presents the calibration and evaluation of the global flood awareness system glofas an operational system that produces ensemble streamflow forecasts and threshold exceedance probabilities for large rivers worldwide the system generates daily streamflow forecasts using a coupled h tessel land surface scheme and the lisflood model forced by ecmwf ifs meteorological forecasts the hydrology model currently uses a priori parameter estimates with uniform values globally which may limit the streamflow forecast skill here the lisflood routing and groundwater model parameters are calibrated with ecmwf reforecasts from 1995 to 2015 as forcing using daily streamflow data from 1287 stations worldwide the calibration of lisflood parameters is performed using an evolutionary optimization algorithm with the kling gupta efficiency kge as objective function the skill improvements are quantified by computing the skill scores as the change in kge relative to the baseline simulation using a priori parameters the results show that simulation skill has improved after calibration kge skill score 0 08 for the large majority of stations during the calibration 67 globally and 77 outside of north america and validation 60 globally and 69 outside of north america periods compared to the baseline simulation however the skill gain was impacted by the bias in the baseline simulation the lowest skill score was obtained in basins with negative bias due to the limitation of the model in correcting the negative bias in streamflow hence further skill improvements could be achieved by reducing the bias in the streamflow by improving the precipitation forecasts and the land surface model the results of this work will have implications on improving the operational glofas flood forecasting www globalfloods eu keywords flood forecasting glofas global hydrology early warning system model calibration 1 introduction flood early warning systems fews are principal components of disaster risk management since they provide a unique opportunity to identify upcoming flood hazards ahead of their occurrence however the effectiveness of early warning systems depends on the skill with which the occurrence and severity of floods can be predicted in recent years global scale operational flood forecasting systems have emerged as promising support tools for disaster preparedness and response worldwide and major effort has been dedicated to improving the skill of such systems see reviews in emerton et al 2016 hirpa et al 2018 flood forecast skill is

hydrological modelling using grid based hydrological routing model coupled with a land surface model has been used for generating streamflow for large river basins or at continental and global scales e g goteti et al 2008 decharme et al 2010 dadson et al 2011 alfieri et al 2013 li et al 2013 wu et al 2014 in the coupled modeling systems the land surface model generates runoff from meteorological

used operationally in the integrated forecast system ifs computes the surface and subsurface runoff a simplified version of lisflood burek et al 2013 is used for routing the runoff produced by the land surface scheme through the river network and computing the groundwater fluxes glofas serves as a primary mechanism of support for flood early warning in regions without local fews and provides complementary flood forecast information for areas with alternative systems such as national or continental fews much effort has been directed at improving glofas forecast skill e g zajac et al 2017 hirpa et al 2016 revilla romero et al 2015a 2015b zsoter et al 2016 however calibration of the hydrological model has not been previously performed in the present study we calibrate the hydrological model parameters underpinning the operational glofas using daily streamflow observations from 1287 stations across the globe the significant contribution of this calibration work lies in its application to global scale operational flood forecasting system hence can help improve the flood early warning through enhanced flood forecast skill furthermore the calibration covers hundreds of river basins with a wide range of climate including snow dominated boreal basins equatorial basins with high runoff and dry basins with low runoff to accommodate the high computational demand of global scale calibration of a distributed hydrological model an evolutionary algorithm with co evolution of multiple simulations running in parallel was used e g deb et al 2002 tang at al 2006 the main objectives of the work are to improve the operational flood forecasting skill by calibrating the flow routing and groundwater model parameters and to quantify the contribution of the flow routing model parameters uncertainty to the streamflow forecast skill we quantify the skill gained as the result of model calibration by comparing to baseline simulations produced using default parameter sets determined based on the literature see feyen et al 2007 the transferability of parameters to another period was evaluated using a different time period from calibration while calibration of the routing model alone is unlikely to remove all the errors in the streamflow simulation we aim to reduce the relative contribution of the parameter error to the streamflow forecast uncertainty the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the runoff routing model and the calibrated parameters are described in section 2 the calibration method and data are presented in section 3 followed by the evaluation method in section 4 results discussions and conclusions are presented in sections 5 6 and 7 respectively 2 lisflood model and parameters lisflood is a distributed hydrological model composed of sub models capable of separately simulating different hydrological processes in glofas the model is run at 0 1 resolution globally and at daily time step the sub models are used for the simulation of groundwater storage groundwater flow and flow routing into and through river channels the groundwater storages and transport are represented using two interconnected groundwater zones each consisting of a linear reservoir burek et al 2013 the outflow from each zone is estimated based on the water storage and time constant of the reservoir the two reservoir time constants the percolation from upper to lower zone and a loss from lower zone to deep groundwater are calibrated parameters see table 1 there are three routing components in lisflood i routing the surface runoff into stream channel ii subsurface runoff to the channel and iii flow routing through the stream channel the surface runoff and in channel routing are performed by solving kinematic wave equations chow 1998 for each model pixel at every time step here set to four hours a 4 point implicit finite difference solution of the kinematic wave equations is applied to compute the flow of water to the nearest downstream channel burek et al 2013 the subsurface runoff routing into the stream channel is modeled differently the total outflow from upper and lower groundwater zones at a given time step is routed to the nearest downstream channel pixel as a scaled sum of the outflow from upper and lower groundwater zones the routing operations implemented using the pcraster software http pcraster geo uu nl require information about stream channel characteristics such as channel length and gradient flow width and depth and manning s roughness coefficient for glofas the river network map the flow direction map the upstream area and the flow length were obtained from the global river network database wu et al 2012 the channel gradient between adjacent pixels was estimated as a ratio of the elevation change to the flow length the river widths were taken from the global width database for large rivers gwd lr yamazaki et al 2014 the bankfull water depth was empirically estimated using long term average discharge by applying manning s equation in glofas a total of 463 large lakes 100 km2 and 667 reservoirs are incorporated to the lisflood model see zajac et al 2017 for the locations the attributes of the lakes and reservoirs were obtained from global databases lehner and döll 2004 icold 2009 lehner et al 2011 outflow from a lake is estimated using its relationship with the lake level using weir equation bollrich 1992 the lake level variation is estimated from the change in lake storage over time zajac et al 2017 each reservoir is simulated based on its relative filling levels and design parameters such as total storage capacity storage limits and outflow requirements the reservoir parameters were estimated from the metadata obtained from global database however to improve the simulation skill we calibrate to adjust the balance between normal and flood storage limits of a reservoir and the normal outflow from a reservoir table 1 irrigation water use is modeled as a monthly withdrawal from discharge in the river network but any potential outtake from groundwater precipitation or soil water is not accounted for open water e g river channels and lakes evaporation is estimated using the penman monteith equation with the required variables extracted from ecmwf reforecast datasets consistent with the forcing data see section 3 2 3 calibration method and data 3 1 calibration method 3 1 1 algorithm we used an evolutionary algorithm ea for the calibration of the lisflood model parameters ea is a population based optimization algorithm in which each individual e g a vector of model parameters in a large population represents a candidate solution for the optimization problem the goodness of fit for each individual is evaluated based on selected objective functions which are designed as either maximization e g kling gupta efficiency or minimization e g root mean square error equations constrained by physically meaningful model parameter ranges the basic principle of the ea is to modify and improve the population through evolution over a range of generations and ultimately identify the best performing individual the evolution mechanisms from one generation parent to the next offspring are inspired by biological evolution such as mutation crossover and reproduction maier et al 2014 nicklow et al 2010 eas have been previously used for calibration of hydrological and or water resources models e g muleta and nicklow 2005 kollat and reed 2005 tang et al 2006 khu et al 2008 hadka and reed 2013 maier et al 2014 beck at al 2016 in ea the evolutionary loop starts by generating offspring λ from the population µ in this work this was performed by varying the population using a combination of a blend crossover 90 and gaussian based mutation 10 algorithms fortin at al 2012 determining the fraction of the population varied by crossover or mutation is part of the algorithm design de rainville et al 2014 and its impact on the accuracy of the optimum solution can be investigated in a separate work the offspring generation is followed by offspring evaluation in order to determine the best performing individuals this was performed though model simulation using the newly generated model parameters we applied a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii deb et al 2002 for the selection of the best performing parameters from a mixed set of parents and offspring µ λ the evolutionary loop continues until a stopping criterion is met eas have been shown to be one of the most efficient and effective algorithms in hydrologic calibration and particularly the nsga ii algorithm was previously found to be superior to other algorithms with its rapid convergence tang at al 2006 3 1 2 implementation the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 was selected as the objective function for the calibration due to the high computational demands of the gridded lisflood model at global scale it was necessary to limit the total number of model simulations during the calibration exercise here a combination of improvement based criteria i e improvements in the objective functions and exhaustion based criteria fixed number of generations was employed for stopping the calibration algorithm using a selected number of basins we first determined the rate of change of the objective function kge with the number of generations in the evolutionary algorithm typically there is a fast improvement rate in the initial steps of the calibration and then a slower rate for longer generations until there is no further skill gain for any additional generation after a convergence to an optimum parameter set since there was minor improvement beyond 10 generations for most of the test basins we determined that the maximum number of generations for the calibration runs to be 15 for the improvement based criterion we determined that if after 5 generations the kge improvement for four consecutive generations is less than 0 001 the algorithm stops in other applications if the computational time is not a concern one can run for a larger number of generations before obtaining the optimal parameter sets moreover it might be desirable to implement several other stopping criteria see marti et al 2009 the ea algorithm was implemented using python programming language and is publicly available as distributed evolutionary algorithm in python deap fortin at al 2012 de rainville et al 2014 https github com deap deap the µ and λ values are set to 12 and 24 respectively and as mentioned previously the probability that an offspring is produced by crossover mutation was set to 0 9 0 1 multiple parallel runs in a given generation are performed by distributing on multiple cores on a window pc the calibration was run for a maximum of 372 simulations 15 generations µ 12 and λ 24 unless the improvement criterion was met earlier for each calibration station before stopping for lisflood these simulations take on average approximately six hours for each calibration station on a pc with 12 cores for stations located in the same river basin the calibration was iteratively performed from upstream to downstream in ascending catchment area using the streamflow from the calibrated upstream subbasin s as inflow for the calibration of the next interstation area this approach accounts for geomorphologic connections along the drainage network and was shown to improve model performance over independent single site calibration wi et al 2015 xue et al 2016 3 2 forcing data for this work the surface and subsurface runoff from ecmwf reforecast were used as input to the lisflood model the runoff fields were produced by the ecmwf land surface scheme htessel which performs the energy and water balance calculations over land and water grids e g balsamo et al 2009 the reforecast is created based on a retrospective run of the most recent version of the ecmwf s integrated forecast system ifs which undergoes regular updates to improve the weather forecast see ecmwf 2017 the purpose of the retrospective run is to generate long term 20 years datasets consistent with the operational weather forecasts alfieri et al 2014 this makes the reforecast a suitable forcing data for the calibration of the operational lisflood model parameters the data record spans from june 1995 to june 2015 and due to frequent model updates it is based on multiple model cycles cycle 41r1 july through march and cycle 41r2 april through june with horizontal resolutions of 32 km and 18 km respectively the runoff fields are interpolated using nearest neighbour method from the native resolutions to 0 1 0 1 grids before they were used for forcing lisflood 3 3 streamflow data daily streamflow observations from 1287 stations around the world were used for the model calibration and evaluation the catchment areas of the stations vary from 484 km2 to 4 8 106 km2 with a median of 38 000 km2 the regional distribution of the stations is as follows 41 6 are located in north america 25 6 in south america 14 1 in europe 10 9 in africa 4 5 in australia and oceania and 3 3 in asia the global runoff data centre grdc was the primary source of the streamflow data but additional data from national hydrological services e g south africa www dwa gov za and from the r arcticnet database for the arctic region http www r arcticnet sr unh edu v4 0 alldata index html were used we only used stations with more than four years of data during the study period 1995 2015 for each station the record was split into two for calibration and validation purposes fig 1 if the record was shorter than eight years four years were used for calibration and the remaining days were used for validation validation was not performed if the available data is less than 1 year if the record was equal to or longer than eight years half was used for calibration and half for validation the most recent period was used for the calibration because the earlier forcing data have greater uncertainty 4 evaluation the evaluation was performed separately for the calibration and validation periods see fig 2 for the calibration period the improvement in streamflow simulations as a result of the calibrated parameters q cal was assessed by comparing with a baseline simulation q def which was generated using default model parameters the kling gupta efficiency kge correlation r percent bias b and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse gupta et al 2009 were used as evaluation metrics the relative improvements were expressed as skill scores 1 kge ss kge cal kge def kge perf kge def where kge ss denotes kge skill score kge def is kge with default parameters kge cal is kge with calibrated parameters and kge perf indicate kge of a perfect simulation 1 positive negative kge ss values indicate improved deteriorated skill after calibration the best kge ss value is 1 for each case the kge was computed with reference to streamflow observations q obs a similar skill score computation was repeated for r and nse in order to have a comparable range of skill scores i e with the best score being 1 the b skill score bss was computed using the absolute values of the percent bias as follows 2 b ss b cal b def b perf b def where the b perf 0 is the b of a perfect simulation b cal is b after calibration and bdef is b with default parameters the second evaluation during the validation period was performed using streamflow observations from a different time period to assess the temporal transferability of the calibrated model parameters 5 results 5 1 streamflow with default parameters to evaluate the accuracy of the baseline streamflow simulation we first compared it with observed streamflow data the computed scores during the calibration period kge b and r show a large regional difference in the performance of the streamflow simulated with default parameters fig 3 the kge score is high e g 0 2 in most parts of the amazon southeastern united states europe northwestern north america and russia however the kge score is low less than0 for most part of africa midwestern united states and australia the regions with low kge score also have large bias positive or negative in the simulated streamflow fig 3b specifically large underestimation in the united states and large streamflow overestimation in africa e g nile congo niger basins and murray darling in australia contributed to the low kge score in those regions tropical basins have high daily streamflow temporal correlation 0 6 but parts of north america have low temporal correlation fig 3c the streamflow overestimation in the tropics is consistent with previous reports that atmospheric models have a tendency of overestimating rainfall amounts e g beck et al 2017 trenberth et al 2011 kang and ahn 2015 the reason for the large streamflow underestimation in north america is however unclear since atmospheric models tend to have low bias in high latitudes 5 2 streamflow with calibrated parameters 5 2 1 kge skill gain to quantify the improvements in simulated streamflow as the result of calibrating the lisflood model parameters we calculated the kge skill score for each calibrated river basin both for the calibration and validation periods see fig 4 the skill scores during the calibration period show that the streamflow skill improved due to calibration for the majority of the river basins overall model calibration improved for 67 of the basins with kge skill score of 0 08 with a median kge skill score of 0 15 p90 0 46 and p10 0 002 however there was no skill gain 29 with kge skill score close to 0 or skill loss 4 with negative kge skill score 0 08 for the remaining basins after calibrating the lisflood model parameters if north america where there was a large negative bias and a considerable number of skill loss after calibration was observed is excluded the percentage of skill gain would increase to 77 and the remaining stations will have 1 skill loss and 22 no skill the overall kge skill score for the validation period is slightly worse than the one for the calibration period globally calibrating the model parameters improved the performance for 60 of the stations we found skill loss for 10 during the validation period the median kge skill score is 0 12 p90 0 42 and p10 0 075 in a similar pattern to the calibration period the skill score map shows that the majority of the skill loss occurred in north america 5 2 2 regional breakdown to investigate the regional variations and the impact of catchment area on the skill gain we present the regional breakdown of the kge nse and r skill scores fig 5 results reveal that the skill score varies across regions on the one hand the kge skill improved kgess 0 08 for a significant number of sub basins across all regions 84 in in south america 82 in europe 67 in australia and oceania 62 in both africa and asia and 52 in north america this indicates that the calibration of the lisflood model parameters improved the performance of the simulated streamflow however the extent of the improvement varies across regions on the other hand calibrating only the selected model parameters has limitations there was no added skill kge skill score 0 compared to the baseline streamflow for 39 of basins in north america 38 in asia 35 in africa 33 in australia 16 in south america and 14 in europe furthermore there is a small number of basins with negative kge skill score e g 9 in north america the median nse skill score is similar to those of kge across all regions but it has more spread for most of the continents the r skill scores show different patterns notably in south america where the large kge skill gain after calibration has not been reflected in r skill score possible influence of the inherent bias in baseline simulation on the skill scores is investigated in section 5 3 while here we use the calibration period to examine the regional dependence of the skill score a similar pattern was observed for the validation period 5 2 3 separation by hydro regions to check if hydroclimate was a factor for the skill improvement we show the calibration skill score variations with hydro regions see fig 6 the global river basins are classified by meybeck et al 2013 into hydro regions also called hydrobelts based on mean annual runoff and temperature according to the classification by meybeck et al there are five global hydro regions boreal mean annual temperature below 0 c mid latitude mean annual temperature between 0 and 15 c and runoff between 150 and 750 mm subtropical mean annual temperature between 15 and 25 c and runoff between 150 and 750 mm equatorial mean average temperature exceeding 20 c and runoff 750 mm and dry mean annual runoff less than 150 mm regions the results show that hydroclimate is an important factor with regards to the calibration skill improvement the equatorial and subtropical basins showed the best skill score with almost all basins having a positive kge skill score while the large majority of basins in mid latitude primarily in north america as discussed above have positive skill score there are several basins with poor skill after calibration boreal and dry basins have large majority of basins with enhanced streamflow skill but also a handful of basins with negative kge skill score the nse and r skill scores also vary across regions the equatorial and subtropical regions showed relatively higher nse skill score and lower r skill score compared to other regions 5 3 the impact of bias on the skill score a potential bias in streamflow may not be adjusted with tuning the model parameters listed in table 1 this is especially important when there is a negative bias in the runoff forcing in which the water deficit cannot be improved unless the runoff bias is first corrected to examine weather runoff bias contributed to the calibration skill we present the kge skill score as a function of streamflow bias in the baseline simulation generated with default parameters for different regions see fig 7 we found that the predominant stations with negative kge skill score are those with negative bias in the baseline streamflow furthermore almost all stations with positive bias in the baseline streamflow have improved kge skill score this is because positive streamflow bias can be corrected by tuning the groundwater percolation or loss parameter to transfer more water to the deep groundwater storage 5 4 how do parameters adjust to understand how model parameters adjust to the bias in the baseline streamflow we look at two hydro regions with contrasting kge skill scores equatorial and mid latitude basins have predominantly large positive and negative streamflow biases respectively fig 8 presents the relative change in model parameter values after calibration normalized by the range for equatorial basins the normalized change for each parameter is defined as pc pd pmax pmin where pc is calibrated pd is default pmax is maximum and pmin is minimum parameter values see table 1 the most important parameter in improving the kge in the equatorial basins with predominantly positive bias is gwloss which is a fraction of lower zone outflow transferred to deep groundwater storage and does not rejoin the river channel this indicates that the calibration algorithm increases the groundwater loss parameter to correct for positive bias in the simulated streamflow the kge skill score is not as sensitive to changes in other parameters in the region however it is more challenging to improve the forecast skill when there is a water deficit in the simulated streamflow due to for example an underestimation in the runoff depth the lisflood model under the current glofas setup controls the timing of streamflow and the groundwater percolation but it does not have any parameter to adjust for the deficit in the runoff depth this is reflected in the mid latitudes fig 9 in which a large number of basins have negative streamflow bias the kge skill gain was obtained for the limited number of basins with negative streamflow bias by tuning the channel manning s coefficient using calchanman1 perhaps through improving the flow timing i e correlation the deep groundwater loss parameter gwloss remains important for basins with positive bias in the region as a further step we look at the bias skill score i e the relative change in the streamflow bias compared to the baseline simulation even though bias was not explicitly used as an objective function in the calibration algorithm it is still generally expected to improve since it is one component of the objective function kge gupta et al 2009 fig 10 shows the impact of calibrating model parameters on reducing the streamflow bias there is a clear separation in the bias skill score based on the baseline streamflow the bias was reduced for basins with overestimation in baseline simulation and it was increased for basins with streamflow underestimation similar to the case for kge skill score the parameter responsible for the water transfer to deep groundwater is the main responsible for the bias skill improvement the overall results indicate that the negative bias cannot be corrected with the 8 parameters currently used in lisflood model calibration and that methods to reduce the bias in the runoff volume e g calibrating the land surface model should be explored 6 discussions the calibration of the lisflood parameters resulted in a substantial improvement of simulated streamflow kge score both during the calibration and validation periods for the majority of stations around the world the kge skill score varies across different regions mainly based on the bias in the baseline streamflow on the one hand river basins with positive bias in the baseline simulation showed the largest improvements in the skill score after calibration and on the other hand those with negative bias showed the lowest skill score there are possible reasons for the low skill score for some of the river basins worldwide 4 of the 1287 stations had negative kge skill score firstly it should be noted that the parameters for the land surface model h tessel responsible for the partitioning of precipitation into runoff and evapotranspiration were not calibrated in this work this means that only the parameters related to the flow timing variability and groundwater loss were altered during the calibration process without changing other hydrological model parameters such as those related to evaporation infiltration etc this limits the effectiveness of the calibration algorithm for basins where for example forcing bias is the main source of streamflow uncertainty secondly uncertainties in the observed streamflow due to errors in station sites data collection human intervention and other sources should always be taken into account e g wilby et al 2017 careful manual inspection and corrections e g locating on the river channel matching upstream area between provided and glofas estimated have been performed for the stations used in this work however the quality control of multi source diverse instrumentation global scale hydrological dataset remains a challenging task thirdly uncertainty in the forcing data may result in fitting model parameters to an erroneous input data this could introduce additional errors to model parameters and could reduce the accuracy of streamflow simulation during the validation period finally the calibration skill loss may partly be attributed to a premature stoppage of the evolutionary algorithm some basins may need longer than the maximum 372 simulations 15 generations set in this work to converge to a global maximum the following further steps can be taken to improve the skill score firstly the bias in the surface and subsurface runoff should be reduced this can be done through improving the skill in the meteorological mainly precipitation forecasts and by calibrating the land surface model h tessel e g orth et al 2016 calibration of the land surface model parameters not just the lisflood model parameters may offset the large bias in precipitation forcing secondly regionalization of model parameters can be applied to transfer model parameters from best performing basins to basins with similar characteristics but with poor scores or with limited streamflow data e g beck at al 2016 samaniego et al 2010 finally multiple objective functions to account for the high flows can be used and the ea calibration algorithm can be run for longer generations to prevent a potential premature stoppage longer runs with different stopping criteria see maier et al 2014 than those implemented in this work may result in better solutions this is however dictated by the time demands of such a computationally demanding global scale calibration the distribution of streamflow observations available for use in this calibration study is unevenly distributed around the world leaving glofas uncalibrated for several flood prone rivers in developing regions for example major river basins in asia with history of frequent flooding e g indus ganges brahmaputra and mekong are not included in this study to fill the gaps in streamflow observations future calibration work could utilize satellite based river level or width estimations e g revilla romero et al 2015a andreadis et al 2007 brakenridge et al 2007 7 conclusions this work is a first attempt to calibrate the model underpinning glofas operational flood forecasts using daily streamflow data from 1287 stations around the world an evolutionary algorithm with kge as an objective function was applied ecmwf reforecast was used as model forcing and a combination of improvement based criteria and exhaustion based criteria were employed for stopping the calibration algorithm results show that calibrating the routing and groundwater model improved streamflow simulations kge skill score compared with the baseline with default parameters for the large majority of stations however the skill gained varies depending on the bias in the baseline simulation the largest improvements occurred in areas with positive bias in the baseline while the lowest skill score was obtained in basins with a negative bias the disparate sensitivity of skill scores to model parameters suggests that calibrating the routing and groundwater model parameters is an important step but it is not sufficient for reducing the streamflow forecast uncertainty future efforts in improving the accuracy of glofas flood forecasts could mainly focus on improving the global runoff estimation through reducing the errors in the meteorological forecasts such as bias reduction and improving the land surface model performance in addition explicitly including an objective function that is exclusively based on peak flows could potentially improve the flood

6963,this paper presents the calibration and evaluation of the global flood awareness system glofas an operational system that produces ensemble streamflow forecasts and threshold exceedance probabilities for large rivers worldwide the system generates daily streamflow forecasts using a coupled h tessel land surface scheme and the lisflood model forced by ecmwf ifs meteorological forecasts the hydrology model currently uses a priori parameter estimates with uniform values globally which may limit the streamflow forecast skill here the lisflood routing and groundwater model parameters are calibrated with ecmwf reforecasts from 1995 to 2015 as forcing using daily streamflow data from 1287 stations worldwide the calibration of lisflood parameters is performed using an evolutionary optimization algorithm with the kling gupta efficiency kge as objective function the skill improvements are quantified by computing the skill scores as the change in kge relative to the baseline simulation using a priori parameters the results show that simulation skill has improved after calibration kge skill score 0 08 for the large majority of stations during the calibration 67 globally and 77 outside of north america and validation 60 globally and 69 outside of north america periods compared to the baseline simulation however the skill gain was impacted by the bias in the baseline simulation the lowest skill score was obtained in basins with negative bias due to the limitation of the model in correcting the negative bias in streamflow hence further skill improvements could be achieved by reducing the bias in the streamflow by improving the precipitation forecasts and the land surface model the results of this work will have implications on improving the operational glofas flood forecasting www globalfloods eu keywords flood forecasting glofas global hydrology early warning system model calibration 1 introduction flood early warning systems fews are principal components of disaster risk management since they provide a unique opportunity to identify upcoming flood hazards ahead of their occurrence however the effectiveness of early warning systems depends on the skill with which the occurrence and severity of floods can be predicted in recent years global scale operational flood forecasting systems have emerged as promising support tools for disaster preparedness and response worldwide and major effort has been dedicated to improving the skill of such systems see reviews in emerton et al 2016 hirpa et al 2018 flood forecast skill is

model parameters underpinning the operational glofas using daily streamflow observations from 1287 stations across the globe the significant contribution of this calibration work lies in its application to global scale operational flood forecasting system hence can help improve the flood early warning through enhanced flood forecast skill furthermore the calibration covers hundreds of river basins with a wide range of climate including snow dominated boreal basins equatorial basins with high runoff and dry basins with low runoff to accommodate the high computational demand of global scale calibration of a distributed hydrological model an evolutionary algorithm with co evolution of multiple simulations running in parallel was used e g deb et al 2002 tang at al 2006 the main objectives of the work are to improve the operational flood forecasting skill by calibrating the flow routing and groundwater model parameters and to quantify the contribution of the flow routing model parameters uncertainty to the streamflow forecast skill we quantify the skill gained as the result of model calibration by comparing to baseline simulations produced using default parameter sets determined based on the literature see feyen et al 2007 the transferability of parameters to another period was evaluated using a different time period from calibration while calibration of the routing model alone is unlikely to remove all the errors in the streamflow simulation we aim to reduce the relative contribution of the parameter error to the streamflow forecast uncertainty the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the runoff routing model and the calibrated parameters are described in section 2 the calibration method and data are presented in section 3 followed by the evaluation method in section 4 results discussions and conclusions are presented in sections 5 6 and 7 respectively 2 lisflood model and parameters lisflood is a distributed hydrological model composed of sub models capable of separately simulating different hydrological processes in glofas the model is run at 0 1 resolution globally and at daily time step the sub models are used for the simulation of groundwater storage groundwater flow and flow routing into and through river channels the groundwater storages and transport are represented using two interconnected groundwater zones each consisting of a linear reservoir burek et al 2013 the outflow from each zone is estimated based on the water storage and time constant of the reservoir the two reservoir time constants the percolation from upper to lower zone and a loss from lower zone to deep groundwater are calibrated parameters see table 1 there are three routing components in lisflood i routing the surface runoff into stream channel ii subsurface runoff to the channel and iii flow routing through the stream channel the surface runoff and in channel routing are performed by solving kinematic wave equations chow 1998 for each model pixel at every time step here set to four hours a 4 point implicit finite difference solution of the kinematic wave equations is applied to compute the flow of water to the nearest downstream channel burek et al 2013 the subsurface runoff routing into the stream channel is modeled differently the total outflow from upper and lower groundwater zones at a given time step is routed to the nearest downstream channel pixel as a scaled sum of the outflow from upper and lower groundwater zones the routing operations implemented using the pcraster software http pcraster geo uu nl require information about stream channel characteristics such as channel length and gradient flow width and depth and manning s roughness coefficient for glofas the river network map the flow direction map the upstream area and the flow length were obtained from the global river network database wu et al 2012 the channel gradient between adjacent pixels was estimated as a ratio of the elevation change to the flow length the river widths were taken from the global width database for large rivers gwd lr yamazaki et al 2014 the bankfull water depth was empirically estimated using long term average discharge by applying manning s equation in glofas a total of 463 large lakes 100 km2 and 667 reservoirs are incorporated to the lisflood model see zajac et al 2017 for the locations the attributes of the lakes and reservoirs were obtained from global databases lehner and döll 2004 icold 2009 lehner et al 2011 outflow from a lake is estimated using its relationship with the lake level using weir equation bollrich 1992 the lake level variation is estimated from the change in lake storage over time zajac et al 2017 each reservoir is simulated based on its relative filling levels and design parameters such as total storage capacity storage limits and outflow requirements the reservoir parameters were estimated from the metadata obtained from global database however to improve the simulation skill we calibrate to adjust the balance between normal and flood storage limits of a reservoir and the normal outflow from a reservoir table 1 irrigation water use is modeled as a monthly withdrawal from discharge in the river network but any potential outtake from groundwater precipitation or soil water is not accounted for open water e g river channels and lakes evaporation is estimated using the penman monteith equation with the required variables extracted from ecmwf reforecast datasets consistent with the forcing data see section 3 2 3 calibration method and data 3 1 calibration method 3 1 1 algorithm we used an evolutionary algorithm ea for the calibration of the lisflood model parameters ea is a population based optimization algorithm in which each individual e g a vector of model parameters in a large population represents a candidate solution for the optimization problem the goodness of fit for each individual is evaluated based on selected objective functions which are designed as either maximization e g kling gupta efficiency or minimization e g root mean square error equations constrained by physically meaningful model parameter ranges the basic principle of the ea is to modify and improve the population through evolution over a range of generations and ultimately identify the best performing individual the evolution mechanisms from one generation parent to the next offspring are inspired by biological evolution such as mutation crossover and reproduction maier et al 2014 nicklow et al 2010 eas have been previously used for calibration of hydrological and or water resources models e g muleta and nicklow 2005 kollat and reed 2005 tang et al 2006 khu et al 2008 hadka and reed 2013 maier et al 2014 beck at al 2016 in ea the evolutionary loop starts by generating offspring λ from the population µ in this work this was performed by varying the population using a combination of a blend crossover 90 and gaussian based mutation 10 algorithms fortin at al 2012 determining the fraction of the population varied by crossover or mutation is part of the algorithm design de rainville et al 2014 and its impact on the accuracy of the optimum solution can be investigated in a separate work the offspring generation is followed by offspring evaluation in order to determine the best performing individuals this was performed though model simulation using the newly generated model parameters we applied a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii deb et al 2002 for the selection of the best performing parameters from a mixed set of parents and offspring µ λ the evolutionary loop continues until a stopping criterion is met eas have been shown to be one of the most efficient and effective algorithms in hydrologic calibration and particularly the nsga ii algorithm was previously found to be superior to other algorithms with its rapid convergence tang at al 2006 3 1 2 implementation the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 was selected as the objective function for the calibration due to the high computational demands of the gridded lisflood model at global scale it was necessary to limit the total number of model simulations during the calibration exercise here a combination of improvement based criteria i e improvements in the objective functions and exhaustion based criteria fixed number of generations was employed for stopping the calibration algorithm using a selected number of basins we first determined the rate of change of the objective function kge with the number of generations in the evolutionary algorithm typically there is a fast improvement rate in the initial steps of the calibration and then a slower rate for longer generations until there is no further skill gain for any additional generation after a convergence to an optimum parameter set since there was minor improvement beyond 10 generations for most of the test basins we determined that the maximum number of generations for the calibration runs to be 15 for the improvement based criterion we determined that if after 5 generations the kge improvement for four consecutive generations is less than 0 001 the algorithm stops in other applications if the computational time is not a concern one can run for a larger number of generations before obtaining the optimal parameter sets moreover it might be desirable to implement several other stopping criteria see marti et al 2009 the ea algorithm was implemented using python programming language and is publicly available as distributed evolutionary algorithm in python deap fortin at al 2012 de rainville et al 2014 https github com deap deap the µ and λ values are set to 12 and 24 respectively and as mentioned previously the probability that an offspring is produced by crossover mutation was set to 0 9 0 1 multiple parallel runs in a given generation are performed by distributing on multiple cores on a window pc the calibration was run for a maximum of 372 simulations 15 generations µ 12 and λ 24 unless the improvement criterion was met earlier for each calibration station before stopping for lisflood these simulations take on average approximately six hours for each calibration station on a pc with 12 cores for stations located in the same river basin the calibration was iteratively performed from upstream to downstream in ascending catchment area using the streamflow from the calibrated upstream subbasin s as inflow for the calibration of the next interstation area this approach accounts for geomorphologic connections along the drainage network and was shown to improve model performance over independent single site calibration wi et al 2015 xue et al 2016 3 2 forcing data for this work the surface and subsurface runoff from ecmwf reforecast were used as input to the lisflood model the runoff fields were produced by the ecmwf land surface scheme htessel which performs the energy and water balance calculations over land and water grids e g balsamo et al 2009 the reforecast is created based on a retrospective run of the most recent version of the ecmwf s integrated forecast system ifs which undergoes regular updates to improve the weather forecast see ecmwf 2017 the purpose of the retrospective run is to generate long term 20 years datasets consistent with the operational weather forecasts alfieri et al 2014 this makes the reforecast a suitable forcing data for the calibration of the operational lisflood model parameters the data record spans from june 1995 to june 2015 and due to frequent model updates it is based on multiple model cycles cycle 41r1 july through march and cycle 41r2 april through june with horizontal resolutions of 32 km and 18 km respectively the runoff fields are interpolated using nearest neighbour method from the native resolutions to 0 1 0 1 grids before they were used for forcing lisflood 3 3 streamflow data daily streamflow observations from 1287 stations around the world were used for the model calibration and evaluation the catchment areas of the stations vary from 484 km2 to 4 8 106 km2 with a median of 38 000 km2 the regional distribution of the stations is as follows 41 6 are located in north america 25 6 in south america 14 1 in europe 10 9 in africa 4 5 in australia and oceania and 3 3 in asia the global runoff data centre grdc was the primary source of the streamflow data but additional data from national hydrological services e g south africa www dwa gov za and from the r arcticnet database for the arctic region http www r arcticnet sr unh edu v4 0 alldata index html were used we only used stations with more than four years of data during the study period 1995 2015 for each station the record was split into two for calibration and validation purposes fig 1 if the record was shorter than eight years four years were used for calibration and the remaining days were used for validation validation was not performed if the available data is less than 1 year if the record was equal to or longer than eight years half was used for calibration and half for validation the most recent period was used for the calibration because the earlier forcing data have greater uncertainty 4 evaluation the evaluation was performed separately for the calibration and validation periods see fig 2 for the calibration period the improvement in streamflow simulations as a result of the calibrated parameters q cal was assessed by comparing with a baseline simulation q def which was generated using default model parameters the kling gupta efficiency kge correlation r percent bias b and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse gupta et al 2009 were used as evaluation metrics the relative improvements were expressed as skill scores 1 kge ss kge cal kge def kge perf kge def where kge ss denotes kge skill score kge def is kge with default parameters kge cal is kge with calibrated parameters and kge perf indicate kge of a perfect simulation 1 positive negative kge ss values indicate improved deteriorated skill after calibration the best kge ss value is 1 for each case the kge was computed with reference to streamflow observations q obs a similar skill score computation was repeated for r and nse in order to have a comparable range of skill scores i e with the best score being 1 the b skill score bss was computed using the absolute values of the percent bias as follows 2 b ss b cal b def b perf b def where the b perf 0 is the b of a perfect simulation b cal is b after calibration and bdef is b with default parameters the second evaluation during the validation period was performed using streamflow observations from a different time period to assess the temporal transferability of the calibrated model parameters 5 results 5 1 streamflow with default parameters to evaluate the accuracy of the baseline streamflow simulation we first compared it with observed streamflow data the computed scores during the calibration period kge b and r show a large regional difference in the performance of the streamflow simulated with default parameters fig 3 the kge score is high e g 0 2 in most parts of the amazon southeastern united states europe northwestern north america and russia however the kge score is low less than0 for most part of africa midwestern united states and australia the regions with low kge score also have large bias positive or negative in the simulated streamflow fig 3b specifically large underestimation in the united states and large streamflow overestimation in africa e g nile congo niger basins and murray darling in australia contributed to the low kge score in those regions tropical basins have high daily streamflow temporal correlation 0 6 but parts of north america have low temporal correlation fig 3c the streamflow overestimation in the tropics is consistent with previous reports that atmospheric models have a tendency of overestimating rainfall amounts e g beck et al 2017 trenberth et al 2011 kang and ahn 2015 the reason for the large streamflow underestimation in north america is however unclear since atmospheric models tend to have low bias in high latitudes 5 2 streamflow with calibrated parameters 5 2 1 kge skill gain to quantify the improvements in simulated streamflow as the result of calibrating the lisflood model parameters we calculated the kge skill score for each calibrated river basin both for the calibration and validation periods see fig 4 the skill scores during the calibration period show that the streamflow skill improved due to calibration for the majority of the river basins overall model calibration improved for 67 of the basins with kge skill score of 0 08 with a median kge skill score of 0 15 p90 0 46 and p10 0 002 however there was no skill gain 29 with kge skill score close to 0 or skill loss 4 with negative kge skill score 0 08 for the remaining basins after calibrating the lisflood model parameters if north america where there was a large negative bias and a considerable number of skill loss after calibration was observed is excluded the percentage of skill gain would increase to 77 and the remaining stations will have 1 skill loss and 22 no skill the overall kge skill score for the validation period is slightly worse than the one for the calibration period globally calibrating the model parameters improved the performance for 60 of the stations we found skill loss for 10 during the validation period the median kge skill score is 0 12 p90 0 42 and p10 0 075 in a similar pattern to the calibration period the skill score map shows that the majority of the skill loss occurred in north america 5 2 2 regional breakdown to investigate the regional variations and the impact of catchment area on the skill gain we present the regional breakdown of the kge nse and r skill scores fig 5 results reveal that the skill score varies across regions on the one hand the kge skill improved kgess 0 08 for a significant number of sub basins across all regions 84 in in south america 82 in europe 67 in australia and oceania 62 in both africa and asia and 52 in north america this indicates that the calibration of the lisflood model parameters improved the performance of the simulated streamflow however the extent of the improvement varies across regions on the other hand calibrating only the selected model parameters has limitations there was no added skill kge skill score 0 compared to the baseline streamflow for 39 of basins in north america 38 in asia 35 in africa 33 in australia 16 in south america and 14 in europe furthermore there is a small number of basins with negative kge skill score e g 9 in north america the median nse skill score is similar to those of kge across all regions but it has more spread for most of the continents the r skill scores show different patterns notably in south america where the large kge skill gain after calibration has not been reflected in r skill score possible influence of the inherent bias in baseline simulation on the skill scores is investigated in section 5 3 while here we use the calibration period to examine the regional dependence of the skill score a similar pattern was observed for the validation period 5 2 3 separation by hydro regions to check if hydroclimate was a factor for the skill improvement we show the calibration skill score variations with hydro regions see fig 6 the global river basins are classified by meybeck et al 2013 into hydro regions also called hydrobelts based on mean annual runoff and temperature according to the classification by meybeck et al there are five global hydro regions boreal mean annual temperature below 0 c mid latitude mean annual temperature between 0 and 15 c and runoff between 150 and 750 mm subtropical mean annual temperature between 15 and 25 c and runoff between 150 and 750 mm equatorial mean average temperature exceeding 20 c and runoff 750 mm and dry mean annual runoff less than 150 mm regions the results show that hydroclimate is an important factor with regards to the calibration skill improvement the equatorial and subtropical basins showed the best skill score with almost all basins having a positive kge skill score while the large majority of basins in mid latitude primarily in north america as discussed above have positive skill score there are several basins with poor skill after calibration boreal and dry basins have large majority of basins with enhanced streamflow skill but also a handful of basins with negative kge skill score the nse and r skill scores also vary across regions the equatorial and subtropical regions showed relatively higher nse skill score and lower r skill score compared to other regions 5 3 the impact of bias on the skill score a potential bias in streamflow may not be adjusted with tuning the model parameters listed in table 1 this is especially important when there is a negative bias in the runoff forcing in which the water deficit cannot be improved unless the runoff bias is first corrected to examine weather runoff bias contributed to the calibration skill we present the kge skill score as a function of streamflow bias in the baseline simulation generated with default parameters for different regions see fig 7 we found that the predominant stations with negative kge skill score are those with negative bias in the baseline streamflow furthermore almost all stations with positive bias in the baseline streamflow have improved kge skill score this is because positive streamflow bias can be corrected by tuning the groundwater percolation or loss parameter to transfer more water to the deep groundwater storage 5 4 how do parameters adjust to understand how model parameters adjust to the bias in the baseline streamflow we look at two hydro regions with contrasting kge skill scores equatorial and mid latitude basins have predominantly large positive and negative streamflow biases respectively fig 8 presents the relative change in model parameter values after calibration normalized by the range for equatorial basins the normalized change for each parameter is defined as pc pd pmax pmin where pc is calibrated pd is default pmax is maximum and pmin is minimum parameter values see table 1 the most important parameter in improving the kge in the equatorial basins with predominantly positive bias is gwloss which is a fraction of lower zone outflow transferred to deep groundwater storage and does not rejoin the river channel this indicates that the calibration algorithm increases the groundwater loss parameter to correct for positive bias in the simulated streamflow the kge skill score is not as sensitive to changes in other parameters in the region however it is more challenging to improve the forecast skill when there is a water deficit in the simulated streamflow due to for example an underestimation in the runoff depth the lisflood model under the current glofas setup controls the timing of streamflow and the groundwater percolation but it does not have any parameter to adjust for the deficit in the runoff depth this is reflected in the mid latitudes fig 9 in which a large number of basins have negative streamflow bias the kge skill gain was obtained for the limited number of basins with negative streamflow bias by tuning the channel manning s coefficient using calchanman1 perhaps through improving the flow timing i e correlation the deep groundwater loss parameter gwloss remains important for basins with positive bias in the region as a further step we look at the bias skill score i e the relative change in the streamflow bias compared to the baseline simulation even though bias was not explicitly used as an objective function in the calibration algorithm it is still generally expected to improve since it is one component of the objective function kge gupta et al 2009 fig 10 shows the impact of calibrating model parameters on reducing the streamflow bias there is a clear separation in the bias skill score based on the baseline streamflow the bias was reduced for basins with overestimation in baseline simulation and it was increased for basins with streamflow underestimation similar to the case for kge skill score the parameter responsible for the water transfer to deep groundwater is the main responsible for the bias skill improvement the overall results indicate that the negative bias cannot be corrected with the 8 parameters currently used in lisflood model calibration and that methods to reduce the bias in the runoff volume e g calibrating the land surface model should be explored 6 discussions the calibration of the lisflood parameters resulted in a substantial improvement of simulated streamflow kge score both during the calibration and validation periods for the majority of stations around the world the kge skill score varies across different regions mainly based on the bias in the baseline streamflow on the one hand river basins with positive bias in the baseline simulation showed the largest improvements in the skill score after calibration and on the other hand those with negative bias showed the lowest skill score there are possible reasons for the low skill score for some of the river basins worldwide 4 of the 1287 stations had negative kge skill score firstly it should be noted that the parameters for the land surface model h tessel responsible for the partitioning of precipitation into runoff and evapotranspiration were not calibrated in this work this means that only the parameters related to the flow timing variability and groundwater loss were altered during the calibration process without changing other hydrological model parameters such as those related to evaporation infiltration etc this limits the effectiveness of the calibration algorithm for basins where for example forcing bias is the main source of streamflow uncertainty secondly uncertainties in the observed streamflow due to errors in station sites data collection human intervention and other sources should always be taken into account e g wilby et al 2017 careful manual inspection and corrections e g locating on the river channel matching upstream area between provided and glofas estimated have been performed for the stations used in this work however the quality control of multi source diverse instrumentation global scale hydrological dataset remains a challenging task thirdly uncertainty in the forcing data may result in fitting model parameters to an erroneous input data this could introduce additional errors to model parameters and could reduce the accuracy of streamflow simulation during the validation period finally the calibration skill loss may partly be attributed to a premature stoppage of the evolutionary algorithm some basins may need longer than the maximum 372 simulations 15 generations set in this work to converge to a global maximum the following further steps can be taken to improve the skill score firstly the bias in the surface and subsurface runoff should be reduced this can be done through improving the skill in the meteorological mainly precipitation forecasts and by calibrating the land surface model h tessel e g orth et al 2016 calibration of the land surface model parameters not just the lisflood model parameters may offset the large bias in precipitation forcing secondly regionalization of model parameters can be applied to transfer model parameters from best performing basins to basins with similar characteristics but with poor scores or with limited streamflow data e g beck at al 2016 samaniego et al 2010 finally multiple objective functions to account for the high flows can be used and the ea calibration algorithm can be run for longer generations to prevent a potential premature stoppage longer runs with different stopping criteria see maier et al 2014 than those implemented in this work may result in better solutions this is however dictated by the time demands of such a computationally demanding global scale calibration the distribution of streamflow observations available for use in this calibration study is unevenly distributed around the world leaving glofas uncalibrated for several flood prone rivers in developing regions for example major river basins in asia with history of frequent flooding e g indus ganges brahmaputra and mekong are not included in this study to fill the gaps in streamflow observations future calibration work could utilize satellite based river level or width estimations e g revilla romero et al 2015a andreadis et al 2007 brakenridge et al 2007 7 conclusions this work is a first attempt to calibrate the model underpinning glofas operational flood forecasts using daily streamflow data from 1287 stations around the world an evolutionary algorithm with kge as an objective function was applied ecmwf reforecast was used as model forcing and a combination of improvement based criteria and exhaustion based criteria were employed for stopping the calibration algorithm results show that calibrating the routing and groundwater model improved streamflow simulations kge skill score compared with the baseline with default parameters for the large majority of stations however the skill gained varies depending on the bias in the baseline simulation the largest improvements occurred in areas with positive bias in the baseline while the lowest skill score was obtained in basins with a negative bias the disparate sensitivity of skill scores to model parameters suggests that calibrating the routing and groundwater model parameters is an important step but it is not sufficient for reducing the streamflow forecast uncertainty future efforts in improving the accuracy of glofas flood forecasts could mainly focus on improving the global runoff estimation through reducing the errors in the meteorological forecasts such as bias reduction and improving the land surface model performance in addition explicitly including an objective function that is exclusively based on peak flows could potentially improve the flood

6964,associated with taylor dispersion in this paper we analyze how the vertical position of a point source solute release will affect the transport process in laminar open channel flow through obtaining and applying analytical solution by the two scale perturbation analysis wu and chen 2014 j fluid mech 740 196 213 which is verified and supported by results from numerical simulations based on multi dimensional spatial concentration distribution of the solute plume we resort to the previously proposed criterion for identifying the stage of solute transport characterized by the dispersion dominated taylor dispersion regime focusing on the relative uniformity of concentration distribution across a given family of curved surfaces wu et al 2016 sci rep 6 20556 the most important finding is that for the solute transport transition into the dispersion dominated regime the necessary time is about 50 more for the case of solute release at free water surface compared with that at the channel bed which is substantial under typical physical parameters other effects of release position include affecting the displacement of the solute plume centroid the value of the maximum mean concentration and non gaussian properties regarding the form of the streamwise distribution of the mean concentration keywords taylor dispersion point source release laminar open channel flow multi dimensional spatial concentration distribution 1 introduction taylor dispersion taylor 1953 is a concept describing an enhanced streamwise diffusion of the transported species which is contributed by the combined action of flow shear and molecular diffusion to date the concept has found broad applications in different fields including environmental science and engineering biomedical engineering and chemical engineering e g bello et al 1994 bruant et al 2002 chen et al 2012 fischer 1976 fischer et al 1979 ghosal 2006 ng and yip 2001 spurny et al 1969 stone et al 2004 wang and huai 2018 wang and chen 2017a wang and chen 2017b wu and chen 2014a wu et al 2012 zeng 2010 zeng et al 2015 zeng et al 2014 the streamwise distribution and evolution of the mean concentration of the solute plume has been discussed as a key issue of the taylor dispersion taylor 1953 this is essentially related to the form of taylor dispersion model an effective diffusion equation for the mean concentration since taylor s initiative taylor 1953 the later contribution of aris 1956 on the method of concentration moment has also been regarded as classic due to its capability of providing exact statistical information for the concentration distribution associated with different orders of moments especially when there is no exact solution found for the governing convection diffusion equation for the shear induced solute transport in flows at the same time direct explorations on the asymptotic solutions chatwin 1970 latini and bernoff 2001 lighthill 1966 phillips and kaye 1996 vrentas and vrentas 2000 for the concentration distribution have been made and different analytical methods were proposed such as the expansion of the mean concentration gill 1967 gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 wu et al 2015 delay diffusion equation smith 1982 smith 1983 homogenization technique mei et al 1996 ng 2006 ng and yip 2001 lyapunov schmidt technique based exact averaging model ratnakar and balakotaiah 2011 ratnakar et al 2012 and so on some results have also been verified by numerical simulations of the transport process houseworth 1984 shankar and lenhoff 1991 stokes and barton 1990 on the other hand systematically studying the transverse or cross sectional concentration distribution was the effort that has been made very recently wu and chen 2014b aiming at getting more information on the physical process of solute transport analytically wu and chen 2014b extended the extensively applied homogenization technique mei et al 1996 ng 2006 ng and yip 2001 on introducing the longitudinal streamwise correction functions and modifying the taylor dispersion model with solutions of the higher order perturbation problems the transverse concentration distribution was then analyzed based on a more accurate description for the skewed streamwise distribution of the mean concentration by considering the process of approaching transverse uniformity of concentration distribution importantly it is found that the time scale needed is much greater than that for approaching streamwise normality the latter of which is generally taken as the time for taylor dispersion model to be applicable at the scale of r2 d r is a characteristic length such as the tube radius and d is the molecular diffusion coefficient this result actually rectified some common mistake in recognition latini and bernoff 2001 that the concentration should be uniformly distributed over the cross section at taylor dispersion stage of solute transport wu and chen 2014b to give a sound description for the transverse concentration distribution patterns a family of curved transverse surfaces were chosen in a further study wu et al 2016 it was found that the concentration actually distributed uniformly across the proposed surfaces at the time scale of r2 d thus the slow asymptotic process of approaching transverse uniformity wu and chen 2014b is simply the result of the decreased streamwise concentration gradient over time combining analytical and numerical results approaching uniform distribution across the curved surfaces is also shown to be a remarkable criterion for identifying the dispersion dominated process taylor dispersion regime during which the analytical solution by wu and chen 2014b is valid it should be noted that the applicability of taylor s model can be determined by considering the vanishing of some non gaussian properties of the streamwise distribution of the mean concentration chatwin 1970 wu and chen 2014b however there is still no common criterion for transition to the dispersion dominated process in this paper the most typical initial condition of instantaneous point source release is considered for laminar open channel flow the idealized flow regime of which is the foundation for models of many natural systems such as in fractures or rivers and has been discussed extensively in literature e g wang et al 2012 in some recent progress fu et al 2016 considered the case of solute release at the free water surface of wetland flows by the obtained concentration moments exploring how the centroid of the solute plume travels downstream and thus affects the concentration distribution here we further study the effects of vertical release position referring to the multi dimensional spatial concentration distribution patterns of the solute plume wu et al 2016 based on the analytical framework of wu and chen 2014b since the plane source solute release wu and chen 2014b can be seen as the superposition of point source releases at different cross sectional positions analysis based on a more fundamental initial condition for the transition to the dispersion dominated regime is promising to reveal more physical insights for the solute transport process this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the modeled system and the analytical method are introduced briefly followed by the determination of the two unknown functions required in the analytical solution under the framework of concentration moments in section 3 detailed discussions on the effects of solute release position are provided by comparisons between analytical and numerical results whereas section 4 presents the conclusions 2 methods the analytical solution by the proposed two scale perturbation analysis as discussed by wu and chen 2014b captures certain non gaussian properties of the streamwise distribution of the mean concentration for only part of the initial stage of the solute transport it is now understood that the solution becomes valid when the transport process enters the so called dispersion dominated regime wu et al 2016 that is the transport is dominated by the mechanism of taylor dispersion but the streamwise distribution of the mean concentration can deviate evidently from the gaussian curve predicted by the one dimensional taylor dispersion model to understand the validity of taylor dispersion model conventionally we can observe the process of approaching normality for the mean concentration chatwin 1970 wu and chen 2014b which can be achieved based on the analytical solution by the proposed two scale perturbation analysis on the other hand to acquire detailed information for the transition to dispersion dominated regime numerical simulations for the transport process are to be performed providing the vertical concentration distribution patterns which serves as a validation for the analytical solution while at the same time can be examined by the proposed criterion regarding a family of curved surfaces for the uniform concentration distribution wu et al 2016 we follow the same numerical procedure as that performed previously for solute transport in laminar tube flow wu et al 2016 which solves the governing convection diffusion equation by the finite element method 2 1 analytical solution by two scale perturbation analysis in this paper combining analytical and numerical approaches the effects of position of a point source solute release are discussed for the laminar open channel flow which is a most idealized case enabling theoretical analysis with important implications extended to solute transport in natural rivers with turbulent flows taylor 1953 taylor 1954 a sketch for the configuration is given as fig 1 the channel is of depth h in a cartesian coordinate system the origin o is set at the bed surface with longitudinal streamwise x axis and vertical z axis an instantaneous point source release is considered at a vertical position z0 at the very beginning of the solute transport the transport process is governed by a convection diffusion equation 1 c t u c x d 2 c x 2 d 2 c z 2 where c is the concentration t is the time u is the flow velocity as a function of z and d is the molecular diffusion coefficient the initial release of solute at a height of z0 with mass q can be given as 2 c x z t t 0 q δ x h δ z h z 0 h where δ is the dirac delta function the boundary conditions at the channel bottom of z 0 and the free water surface of z h can be expressed as 3 c z z 0 c z z h 0 since the amount of release is finite the upstream and downstream conditions are 4 c x z t x 0 by introducing the following dimensionless parameters 5 ψ u u τ t l u ξ x l τ ζ z h h l pe u h d ω c q where l is a length characterizing the longitudinal scale of the solute plume and the angle brackets define the vertical average operation for example 6 u 0 1 u d ζ defines the mean velocity the governing equation with its boundary conditions are rewritten as 7 ω τ ψ ω ξ 2 1 pe 2 ω ξ 2 1 pe 2 ω ζ 2 8 ω ζ ζ 0 ω ζ ζ 1 0 where the prime indicates the deviation from the mean e g 9 ψ ψ ψ ψ 1 defines the dimensionless velocity deviation under the condition of 1 a two scale perturbation analysis can be carried out wu and chen 2014b to avoid a simple duplication in text only main results of the analysis are given in the following paragraphs to remove the unknown parameter in the coordinate system as defined in eq 5 alternatively we adopt new dimensionless parameters 10 t t h 2 d η x h pe t where we note that the dimensionless streamwise axis η is a moving coordinate with the vertical mean velocity of the flow ψ 1 based on eq 10 we can express our analytical solution for concentration distribution with modifications on the zeroth order term ω0 up to the second order 11 ω 2

taylor dispersion model c 1 and c 2 are the currently unknown functions with respect to the dimensionless solute release position parameter ζ0 and f 1 f 3 are vertical distribution functions which can be determined as 13 2 f 1 ζ 2 ψ 14 2 f 2 ζ 2 f 1 ψ 15 2 f 3 ζ 2 f 2 ψ f 1 ψ f 1 with constraints of i 1 2 3 16 f i ζ ζ 0 f i ζ ζ 1 0 17 f i 0 it is noted that since the concept of taylor dispersion is for the vertical mean concentration in a one dimensional sense the initial conditions of instantaneous point and plane source injection lead to the same analytical solution of eq 12 under our framework of two scale perturbation analysis the difference will be revealed by the different functions of c 1 and c 1 in eq 11 here dt defined as 18 d t 1 pe 2 f 1 ψ is taylor dispersion coefficient as an effective diffusion coefficient the second term at the right hand side of eq 18 indicating the contribution of flow shear on the enhancement of streamwise scattering of the transported species is usually several orders of magnitude greater than 1 pe2 for the effect of molecular diffusion thus the contribution of streamwise molecular diffusion can in general be neglected the flow velocity

laminar open channel flow fischer et al 1979 3 results and discussions 3 1 general effects of solute release position on the mean concentration distribution as a first estimation eq 44 is expected to predict the streamwise distribution of the mean concentration with relatively high accuracy for the dimensionless time of t 0 5 wu and chen 2014b in fig 2 a we illustrate the analytical results of the mean concentration at t 0 5 for three typical dimensionless initial solute release positions ζ0 it is seen that the mean concentration distributions are mainly affected by the release position parameter ζ0 in three ways as the position varies from the bed to the free water surface 1 the streamwise position of the solute plume moves downstream increase in η 2 the maximum mean concentration of the distribution first decreases then increases with the maximum appearing for the case of solute release at free water surface 3 non gaussian properties of the curves vary accordingly for example the mean concentration distribution changes from left skewed to right skewed gradually generally speaking these features are not surprising for the point source solute release near the bed at the very beginning the entire solute plume moves slowly with the local velocity that is slower than the mean flow velocity so in a reference frame moving longitudinally with this mean velocity as we applied in the analysis the plume will experience an initial period with its centroid traveling upstream gradually η 0 the movement of the centroid slows down and finally stops as the vertical mixing becomes sufficient in addition the exact streamwise displacement of the centroid of the plume can be calculated referring to eq 36 the first order concentration moment on the other hand during the initial period most of the released mass concentrates on the vicinity of the trailing edge of the cloud only by the slow vertical diffusion a portion of the mass will be gradually transferred to a higher level in the channel with a faster flow velocity resulting in the streamwise scattering of the solute mass i e the flow shear plays a role thus at an early stage of the transport the streamwise distribution of the mean concentration appears in the state of left skewed for the case of solute release at channel bed the observed features of the release at the free water surface can be analyzed in a similar way for taylor s model as a one dimensional simplification effects of the solute release position cannot be captured to verify the performance of the obtained analytical solution comparisons with numerical results are presented in fig 2 b d as expected for the point source solute release at the channel bed ζ0 0 and at an intermediate position of ζ0 0 3 at the given time of t 0 5 the agreements are generally good however it is seen that great discrepancy has been observed for the case of discharging at the free water surface ζ0 1 the disagreement is mainly shown at the downstream leading edge of the plume indicating that the transport process is currently not dominated by the mechanism of taylor dispersion 3 2 effects of release position on multi dimensional concentration distribution as illustrated by wu et al 2016 a new criterion is proposed for taylor dispersion regime the concentration should be uniformly distributed across a family of invariant curved surfaces thus regarding transition into the dispersion dominated stage uniformity across the curved surfaces should be relatively achieved all the concentration contours of the solute plume should resemble the given curved surfaces and no local hot spot of concentrated solute mass exists for the initial condition of plane source solute release in laminar tube flow the transport process enters the dispersion dominated stage generally after the dimensionless time of t 0 2 wu et al 2016 guided by the proposed criterion fig 3 gives the detailed concentration distribution information for the three positions of the point source solute release the same as that for fig 2 at the same dimensionless time the shape of the curved surface is calculated to be 46 θ f 1 1 15 ζ 2 2 ζ 3 2 ζ 4 8 it is shown that for the first two cases fig 3 a and b the contours of the concentration distribute in a similar way and the transport processes can all be roughly considered as dominated by the mechanism of taylor dispersion for the third case in fig 3 c a hot spot of concentrated solute mass is seen to be located at the vicinity of free water surface under this circumstance the vertical mixing is insufficient across the curved surfaces near the leading edge of the solute plume which is still advected downstream with the free water surface flow velocity i e it is convection dominated instead of the dispersion dominated this convection dominated feature can be further characterized through the flow velocity distribution eq 19 which gives the downstream location of η 0 25 at the time t 0 5 if advected with the flow velocity at the free water surface ζ ζ0 1 agreeing with the location of the sharp concentration gradient appeared close to the leading edge of the plume figs 2 d and 3 c this explains the limitation of the presented analytical solution eq 44 in predicting the correct mean concentration distribution near the region of η 0 25 in fig 2 d given that eq 44 is based on modifying the long term solution of taylor dispersion model eq 45 for the dispersion dominated transport process however for the upstream region of η 0 in the case of solute release at free water surface the mixing is relatively good across the curved surfaces as represented by eq 46 it is observed that the extent of mixing is even better than that for the upstream plume shown by fig 3 a and b corresponding to a better prediction of the mean concentration by the obtained analytical solution 3 3 vertical diffusion and effects of flow shear simply referring to the zero th order moment eq 31 giving the total solute mass at each streamline of the channel flow it is obvious that for the two typical case of solute release at the channel bed and the free water surface the degrees of vertical mixing are close at any time thus on the one hand eq 31 seems to imply that the necessary time for the streamwise transport to become dispersion dominated should be close too for the two different initial conditions on the other hand the results presented in figs 2 and 3 clearly indicate that this is not the case recall that the dispersion dominated regime is contributed by the balance of two mechanisms respectively as the vertical diffusion and flow shear if the vertical diffusion alone cannot explain the observed difference in the process approaching the long term transport regime the flow shear must have played a role for characterizing the flow shear we can calculate the vertical gradient of the streamwise velocity based on eq 19 47 ψ ζ 3 3 ζ which is in fact monotonously decreasing as the increase of the vertical position ζ i e the strongest shear appears at the bottom of the channel while the weakest shear zero shows up at the free water surface thus for the release on the top of the channel evidently the solute plume moves downstream with the fastest speed but its streamwise scattering is the slowest at the very beginning because at the vicinity of the free water surface almost no velocity difference of the flow exists only by the vertical diffusion a portion of the solute mass is transferred deeper into the channel where the flow shear increases gradually stretching the plume and contributing to the streamwise dispersion compared with solute released at the bottom of the channel the hot spot of concentrated solute mass close to where it is released takes longer time to disappear for the case of solute release at the free water surface due to the slow streamwise dispersion at the vicinity which is key for the transport to be characterized by the dispersion dominated regime and the concentration distribution to be correctly described by the obtained solution eq 44 to have more detailed information on the processes of entering the dispersion dominated regime of transport in figs 4 and 5 we show the multi dimensional spatial concentration distribution evolutions for the two typical cases which are generally in accordance with our qualitative description above on the concerned dimensionless time for achieving relative uniformity across the curved surfaces by the two figures we can roughly give estimates of t 0 9 and t 0 6 for the free water surface and channel bed solute releases respectively thus for the former case the dispersion dominated regime started much later the time of which is about 50 longer compared with the case of channel bed solute release under typical parameters the difference between the two times can be substantial for example given the molecular diffusivity of salt in water on the order of d 10 9 m2 s a depth of the channel on the order of h 10 1 m then the time difference can reach δt 0 3 h 2 d 8 102 h for the case of turbulent flow related analysis can be extended and this time can be shorter for solute transport in natural rivers depending on the turbulent diffusivity barton 1983 taylor 1954 in figs 6 and 7 for the two typical cases we illustrate the evolution of the streamwise distribution of mean concentration when the transport process approximately transitions to the dispersion dominated regime the streamwise displacement of the solute plume centroid reveals the unique information for a specific initial solute release condition and it remains unchanged during the taylor dispersion regime aris 1956 the non gaussian properties of the curves such as the asymmetry fig 7 decrease with time chatwin 1970 wu and chen 2014b in accordance with the criterion of evaluating the concentration distribution uniformity across some curved surfaces wu et al 2016 the existence of the hot spot of concentrated solute mass reveals some convection dominated feature corresponding to sharp concentration gradient in the distribution fig 7 a and the disappear of which indicates the transport is in the dispersion dominated regime and the concentration distribution could be relatively well described by the obtained analytical solution in this paper fig 7 c and d it is demonstrated again by comparison between figs 6 and 7 that the case of solute release at channel bed approaches taylor dispersion regime much faster than that at the free water surface 4 conclusions a point source solute release is considered to be the most fundamental and idealized initial condition in the analysis of scalar transport in natural rivers in this paper combining the analytical solution by the previously proposed two scale perturbation analysis and the results of numerical simulations we analyzed the effects of solute release position on its transport in approaching the dispersion dominated regime by the velocity profile of the laminar open channel flow the general form of the analytical solution with modifications on the taylor dispersion term up to the second order is deduced also obtained are the vertical distribution functions by which some flow related quantities can be determined the important unknown functions c1 and c2 containing information for the initial conditions are deduced with the aid of the concentration moment method using numerical simulations the performance of the analytical solution is analyzed in detail as pointed out by wu et al 2016 the solution works well under condition that the solute concentration is relatively uniform across a family of curved surfaces it is seen that where the analytical solution fails in predicting the streamwise distribution of the mean concentration there exists great local non uniformity related to the hot spot of concentrated solute mass as a sign of convection dominated transport features the mean concentration distributions are mainly affected by the release position parameter ζ0 in three ways as the position varies from the bed to the free water surface 1 the longitudinal position of the solute plume centroid moves downstream increase in η which can be calculated by the vertical mean of the first order concentration moment 2 the maximum concentration of the distribution first decreases then increases with a maximum value appeared for the condition of free water surface release 3 the non gaussian properties of the curves change with ζ0 for example the mean concentration distribution varies from left skewed to right skewed gradually the most important finding is that the transport of solute plume initially released at free water surface enters the dispersion dominated regime for about 50 slower than that released at channel bed which is different from our expectation of close times we found that qualitatively when the solute is released close to the top of the channel it is more difficult for the plume to disperse in streamwise at the vicinity of the free water surface due to nearly zero velocity gradient in depth thus the initially released solute is generally advected downstream and needs more time to smear out the great concentration gradient at the leading edge of the plume although the analysis in this paper is based on the laminar flow condition the identified mechanism relating the extent of transverse solute mixing to that of the flow shear can be extended to more complicated transport conditions e g turbulent flow

6964,associated with taylor dispersion in this paper we analyze how the vertical position of a point source solute release will affect the transport process in laminar open channel flow through obtaining and applying analytical solution by the two scale perturbation analysis wu and chen 2014 j fluid mech 740 196 213 which is verified and supported by results from numerical simulations based on multi dimensional spatial concentration distribution of the solute plume we resort to the previously proposed criterion for identifying the stage of solute transport characterized by the dispersion dominated taylor dispersion regime focusing on the relative uniformity of concentration distribution across a given family of curved surfaces wu et al 2016 sci rep 6 20556 the most important finding is that for the solute transport transition into the dispersion dominated regime the necessary time is about 50 more for the case of solute release at free water surface compared with that at the channel bed which is substantial under typical physical parameters other effects of release position include affecting the displacement of the solute plume centroid the value of the maximum mean concentration and non gaussian properties regarding the form of the streamwise distribution of the mean concentration keywords taylor dispersion point source release laminar open channel flow multi dimensional spatial concentration distribution 1 introduction taylor dispersion taylor 1953 is a concept describing an enhanced streamwise diffusion of the transported species which is contributed by the combined action of flow shear and molecular diffusion to date the concept has found broad applications in different fields including environmental science and engineering biomedical engineering and chemical engineering e g bello et al 1994 bruant et al 2002 chen et al 2012 fischer 1976 fischer et al 1979 ghosal 2006 ng and yip 2001 spurny et al 1969 stone et al 2004 wang and huai 2018 wang and chen 2017a wang and chen 2017b wu and chen 2014a wu et al 2012 zeng 2010 zeng et al 2015 zeng et al 2014 the streamwise distribution and evolution of the mean concentration of the solute plume has been discussed as a key issue of the taylor dispersion taylor 1953 this is essentially related to the form of taylor dispersion model an effective diffusion equation for the mean concentration since taylor s initiative taylor 1953 the later contribution of aris 1956 on the method of concentration moment has also been regarded as classic due to its capability of providing exact statistical information for the concentration distribution associated with different orders of moments especially when there is no exact solution found for the governing convection diffusion equation for the shear induced solute transport in flows at the same time direct explorations on the asymptotic solutions chatwin 1970 latini and bernoff 2001 lighthill 1966 phillips and kaye 1996 vrentas and vrentas 2000 for the concentration distribution have been made and different analytical methods were proposed such as the expansion of the mean concentration gill 1967 gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 wu et al 2015 delay diffusion equation smith 1982 smith 1983 homogenization technique mei et al 1996 ng 2006 ng and yip 2001 lyapunov schmidt technique based exact averaging model ratnakar and balakotaiah 2011 ratnakar et al 2012 and so on some results have also been verified by numerical simulations of the transport process houseworth 1984 shankar and lenhoff 1991 stokes and barton 1990 on the other hand systematically studying the transverse or cross sectional concentration distribution was the effort that has been made very recently wu and chen 2014b aiming at getting more information on the physical process of solute transport analytically wu and chen 2014b extended the extensively applied homogenization technique mei et al 1996 ng 2006 ng and yip 2001 on introducing the longitudinal streamwise correction functions and modifying the taylor dispersion model with solutions of the higher order perturbation problems the transverse concentration distribution was then analyzed based on a more accurate description for the skewed streamwise distribution of the mean concentration by considering the process of approaching transverse uniformity of concentration distribution importantly it is found that the time scale needed is much greater than that for approaching streamwise normality the latter of which is generally taken as the time for taylor dispersion model to be applicable at the scale of r2 d r is a characteristic length such as the tube radius and d is the molecular diffusion coefficient this result actually rectified some common mistake in recognition latini and bernoff 2001 that the concentration should be uniformly distributed over the cross section at taylor dispersion stage of solute transport wu and chen 2014b to give a sound description for the transverse concentration distribution patterns a family of curved transverse surfaces were chosen in a further study wu et al 2016 it was found that the concentration actually distributed uniformly across the proposed surfaces at the time scale of r2 d thus the slow asymptotic process of approaching transverse uniformity wu and chen 2014b is simply the result of the decreased streamwise concentration gradient over time combining analytical and numerical results approaching uniform distribution across the curved surfaces is also shown to be a remarkable criterion for identifying the dispersion dominated process taylor dispersion regime during which the analytical solution by wu and chen 2014b is valid it should be noted that the applicability of taylor s model can be determined by considering the vanishing of some non gaussian properties of the streamwise distribution of the mean concentration chatwin 1970 wu and chen 2014b however there is still no common criterion for transition to the dispersion dominated process in this paper the most typical initial condition of instantaneous point source release is considered for laminar open channel flow the idealized flow regime of which is the foundation for models of many natural systems such as in fractures or rivers and has been discussed extensively in literature e g wang et al 2012 in some recent progress fu et al 2016 considered the case of solute release at the free water surface of wetland flows by the obtained concentration moments exploring how the centroid of the solute plume travels downstream and thus affects the concentration distribution here we further study the effects of vertical release position referring to the multi dimensional spatial concentration distribution patterns of the solute plume wu et al 2016 based on the analytical framework of wu and chen 2014b since the plane source solute release wu and chen 2014b can be seen as the superposition of point source releases at different cross sectional positions analysis based on a more fundamental initial condition for the transition to the dispersion dominated regime is promising to reveal more physical insights for the solute transport process this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the modeled system and the analytical method are introduced briefly followed by the determination of the two unknown functions required in the analytical solution under the framework of concentration moments in section 3 detailed discussions on the effects of solute release position are provided by comparisons between analytical and numerical results whereas section 4 presents the conclusions 2 methods the analytical solution by the proposed two scale perturbation analysis as discussed by wu and chen 2014b captures certain non gaussian properties of the streamwise distribution of the mean concentration for only part of the initial stage of the solute transport it is now understood that the solution becomes valid when the transport process enters the so called dispersion dominated regime wu et al 2016 that is the transport is dominated by the mechanism of taylor dispersion but the streamwise distribution of the mean concentration can deviate evidently from the gaussian curve predicted by the one dimensional taylor dispersion model to understand the validity of taylor dispersion model conventionally we can observe the process of approaching normality for the mean concentration chatwin 1970 wu and chen 2014b which can be achieved based on the analytical solution by the proposed two scale perturbation analysis on the other hand to acquire detailed information for the transition to dispersion dominated regime numerical simulations for the transport process are to be performed providing the vertical concentration distribution patterns which serves as a validation for the analytical solution while at the same time can be examined by the proposed criterion regarding a family of curved surfaces for the uniform concentration distribution wu et al 2016 we follow the same numerical procedure as that performed previously for solute transport in laminar tube flow wu et al 2016 which solves the governing convection diffusion equation by the finite element method 2 1 analytical solution by two scale perturbation analysis in this paper combining analytical and numerical approaches the effects of position of a point source solute release are discussed for the laminar open channel flow which is a most idealized case enabling theoretical analysis with important implications extended to solute transport in natural rivers with turbulent flows taylor 1953 taylor 1954 a sketch for the configuration is given as fig 1 the channel is of depth h in a cartesian coordinate system the origin o is set at the bed surface with longitudinal streamwise x axis and vertical z axis an instantaneous point source release is considered at a vertical position z0 at the very beginning of the solute transport the transport process is governed by a convection diffusion equation 1 c t u c x d 2 c x 2 d 2 c z 2 where c is the concentration t is the time u is the flow velocity as a function of z and d is the molecular diffusion coefficient the initial release of solute at a height of z0 with mass q can be given as 2 c x z t t 0 q δ x h δ z h z 0 h where δ is the dirac delta function the boundary conditions at the channel bottom of z 0 and the free water surface of z h can be expressed as 3 c z z 0 c z z h 0 since the amount of release is finite the upstream and downstream conditions are 4 c x z t x 0 by introducing the following dimensionless parameters 5 ψ u u τ t l u ξ x l τ ζ z h h l pe u h d ω c q where l is a length characterizing the longitudinal scale of the solute plume and the angle brackets define the vertical average operation for example 6 u 0 1 u d ζ defines the mean velocity the governing equation with its boundary conditions are rewritten as 7 ω τ ψ ω ξ 2 1 pe 2 ω ξ 2 1 pe 2 ω ζ 2 8 ω ζ ζ 0 ω ζ ζ 1 0 where the prime indicates the deviation from the mean e g 9 ψ ψ ψ ψ 1 defines the dimensionless velocity deviation under the condition of 1 a two scale perturbation analysis can be carried out wu and chen 2014b to avoid a simple duplication in text only main results of the analysis are given in the following paragraphs to remove the unknown parameter in the coordinate system as defined in eq 5 alternatively we adopt new dimensionless parameters 10 t t h 2 d η x h pe t where we note that the dimensionless streamwise axis η is a moving coordinate with the vertical mean velocity of the flow ψ 1 based on eq 10 we can express our analytical solution for concentration distribution with modifications on the zeroth order term ω0 up to the second order 11 ω 2

taylor dispersion model c 1 and c 2 are the currently unknown functions with respect to the dimensionless solute release position parameter ζ0 and f 1 f 3 are vertical distribution functions which can be determined as 13 2 f 1 ζ 2 ψ 14 2 f 2 ζ 2 f 1 ψ 15 2 f 3 ζ 2 f 2 ψ f 1 ψ f 1 with constraints of i 1 2 3 16 f i ζ ζ 0 f i ζ ζ 1 0 17 f i 0 it is noted that since the concept of taylor dispersion is for the vertical mean concentration in a one dimensional sense the initial conditions of instantaneous point and plane source injection lead to the same analytical solution of eq 12 under our framework of two scale perturbation analysis the difference will be revealed by the different functions of c 1 and c 1 in eq 11 here dt defined as 18 d t 1 pe 2 f 1 ψ is taylor dispersion coefficient as an effective diffusion coefficient the second term at the right hand side of eq 18 indicating the contribution of flow shear on the enhancement of streamwise scattering of the transported species is usually several orders of magnitude greater than 1 pe2 for the effect of molecular diffusion thus the contribution of streamwise molecular diffusion can in general be neglected the flow velocity

laminar open channel flow fischer et al 1979 3 results and discussions 3 1 general effects of solute release position on the mean concentration distribution as a first estimation eq 44 is expected to predict the streamwise distribution of the mean concentration with relatively high accuracy for the dimensionless time of t 0 5 wu and chen 2014b in fig 2 a we illustrate the analytical results of the mean concentration at t 0 5 for three typical dimensionless initial solute release positions ζ0 it is seen that the mean concentration distributions are mainly affected by the release position parameter ζ0 in three ways as the position varies from the bed to the free water surface 1 the streamwise position of the solute plume moves downstream increase in η 2 the maximum mean concentration of the distribution first decreases then increases with the maximum appearing for the case of solute release at free water surface 3 non gaussian properties of the curves vary accordingly for example the mean concentration distribution changes from left skewed to right skewed gradually generally speaking these features are not surprising for the point source solute release near the bed at the very beginning the entire solute plume moves slowly with the local velocity that is slower than the mean flow velocity so in a reference frame moving longitudinally with this mean velocity as we applied in the analysis the plume will experience an initial period with its centroid traveling upstream gradually η 0 the movement of the centroid slows down and finally stops as the vertical mixing becomes sufficient in addition the exact streamwise displacement of the centroid of the plume can be calculated referring to eq 36 the first order concentration moment on the other hand during the initial period most of the released mass concentrates on the vicinity of the trailing edge of the cloud only by the slow vertical diffusion a portion of the mass will be gradually transferred to a higher level in the channel with a faster flow velocity resulting in the streamwise scattering of the solute mass i e the flow shear plays a role thus at an early stage of the transport the streamwise distribution of the mean concentration appears in the state of left skewed for the case of solute release at channel bed the observed features of the release at the free water surface can be analyzed in a similar way for taylor s model as a one dimensional simplification effects of the solute release position cannot be captured to verify the performance of the obtained analytical solution comparisons with numerical results are presented in fig 2 b d as expected for the point source solute release at the channel bed ζ0 0 and at an intermediate position of ζ0 0 3 at the given time of t 0 5 the agreements are generally good however it is seen that great discrepancy has been observed for the case of discharging at the free water surface ζ0 1 the disagreement is mainly shown at the downstream leading edge of the plume indicating that the transport process is currently not dominated by the mechanism of taylor dispersion 3 2 effects of release position on multi dimensional concentration distribution as illustrated by wu et al 2016 a new criterion is proposed for taylor dispersion regime the concentration should be uniformly distributed across a family of invariant curved surfaces thus regarding transition into the dispersion dominated stage uniformity across the curved surfaces should be relatively achieved all the concentration contours of the solute plume should resemble the given curved surfaces and no local hot spot of concentrated solute mass exists for the initial condition of plane source solute release in laminar tube flow the transport process enters the dispersion dominated stage generally after the dimensionless time of t 0 2 wu et al 2016 guided by the proposed criterion fig 3 gives the detailed concentration distribution information for the three positions of the point source solute release the same as that for fig 2 at the same dimensionless time the shape of the curved surface is calculated to be 46 θ f 1 1 15 ζ 2 2 ζ 3 2 ζ 4 8 it is shown that for the first two cases fig 3 a and b the contours of the concentration distribute in a similar way and the transport processes can all be roughly considered as dominated by the mechanism of taylor dispersion for the third case in fig 3 c a hot spot of concentrated solute mass is seen to be located at the vicinity of free water surface under this circumstance the vertical mixing is insufficient across the curved surfaces near the leading edge of the solute plume which is still advected downstream with the free water surface flow velocity i e it is convection dominated instead of the dispersion dominated this convection dominated feature can be further characterized through the flow velocity distribution eq 19 which gives the downstream location of η 0 25 at the time t 0 5 if advected with the flow velocity at the free water surface ζ ζ0 1 agreeing with the location of the sharp concentration gradient appeared close to the leading edge of the plume figs 2 d and 3 c this explains the limitation of the presented analytical solution eq 44 in predicting the correct mean concentration distribution near the region of η 0 25 in fig 2 d given that eq 44 is based on modifying the long term solution of taylor dispersion model eq 45 for the dispersion dominated transport process however for the upstream region of η 0 in the case of solute release at free water surface the mixing is relatively good across the curved surfaces as represented by eq 46 it is observed that the extent of mixing is even better than that for the upstream plume shown by fig 3 a and b corresponding to a better prediction of the mean concentration by the obtained analytical solution 3 3 vertical diffusion and effects of flow shear simply referring to the zero th order moment eq 31 giving the total solute mass at each streamline of the channel flow it is obvious that for the two typical case of solute release at the channel bed and the free water surface the degrees of vertical mixing are close at any time thus on the one hand eq 31 seems to imply that the necessary time for the streamwise transport to become dispersion dominated should be close too for the two different initial conditions on the other hand the results presented in figs 2 and 3 clearly indicate that this is not the case recall that the dispersion dominated regime is contributed by the balance of two mechanisms respectively as the vertical diffusion and flow shear if the vertical diffusion alone cannot explain the observed difference in the process approaching the long term transport regime the flow shear must have played a role for characterizing the flow shear we can calculate the vertical gradient of the streamwise velocity based on eq 19 47 ψ ζ 3 3 ζ which is in fact monotonously decreasing as the increase of the vertical position ζ i e the strongest shear appears at the bottom of the channel while the weakest shear zero shows up at the free water surface thus for the release on the top of the channel evidently the solute plume moves downstream with the fastest speed but its streamwise scattering is the slowest at the very beginning because at the vicinity of the free water surface almost no velocity difference of the flow exists only by the vertical diffusion a portion of the solute mass is transferred deeper into the channel where the flow shear increases gradually stretching the plume and contributing to the streamwise dispersion compared with solute released at the bottom of the channel the hot spot of concentrated solute mass close to where it is released takes longer time to disappear for the case of solute release at the free water surface due to the slow streamwise dispersion at the vicinity which is key for the transport to be characterized by the dispersion dominated regime and the concentration distribution to be correctly described by the obtained solution eq 44 to have more detailed information on the processes of entering the dispersion dominated regime of transport in figs 4 and 5 we show the multi dimensional spatial concentration distribution evolutions for the two typical cases which are generally in accordance with our qualitative description above on the concerned dimensionless time for achieving relative uniformity across the curved surfaces by the two figures we can roughly give estimates of t 0 9 and t 0 6 for the free water surface and channel bed solute releases respectively thus for the former case the dispersion dominated regime started much later the time of which is about 50 longer compared with the case of channel bed solute release under typical parameters the difference between the two times can be substantial for example given the molecular diffusivity of salt in water on the order of d 10 9 m2 s a depth of the channel on the order of h 10 1 m then the time difference can reach δt 0 3 h 2 d 8 102 h for the case of turbulent flow related analysis can be extended and this time can be shorter for solute transport in natural rivers depending on the turbulent diffusivity barton 1983 taylor 1954 in figs 6 and 7 for the two typical cases we illustrate the evolution of the streamwise distribution of mean concentration when the transport process approximately transitions to the dispersion dominated regime the streamwise displacement of the solute plume centroid reveals the unique information for a specific initial solute release condition and it remains unchanged during the taylor dispersion regime aris 1956 the non gaussian properties of the curves such as the asymmetry fig 7 decrease with time chatwin 1970 wu and chen 2014b in accordance with the criterion of evaluating the concentration distribution uniformity across some curved surfaces wu et al 2016 the existence of the hot spot of concentrated solute mass reveals some convection dominated feature corresponding to sharp concentration gradient in the distribution fig 7 a and the disappear of which indicates the transport is in the dispersion dominated regime and the concentration distribution could be relatively well described by the obtained analytical solution in this paper fig 7 c and d it is demonstrated again by comparison between figs 6 and 7 that the case of solute release at channel bed approaches taylor dispersion regime much faster than that at the free water surface 4 conclusions a point source solute release is considered to be the most fundamental and idealized initial condition in the analysis of scalar transport in natural rivers in this paper combining the analytical solution by the previously proposed two scale perturbation analysis and the results of numerical simulations we analyzed the effects of solute release position on its transport in approaching the dispersion dominated regime by the velocity profile of the laminar open channel flow the general form of the analytical solution with modifications on the taylor dispersion term up to the second order is deduced also obtained are the vertical distribution functions by which some flow related quantities can be determined the important unknown functions c1 and c2 containing information for the initial conditions are deduced with the aid of the concentration moment method using numerical simulations the performance of the analytical solution is analyzed in detail as pointed out by wu et al 2016 the solution works well under condition that the solute concentration is relatively uniform across a family of curved surfaces it is seen that where the analytical solution fails in predicting the streamwise distribution of the mean concentration there exists great local non uniformity related to the hot spot of concentrated solute mass as a sign of convection dominated transport features the mean concentration distributions are mainly affected by the release position parameter ζ0 in three ways as the position varies from the bed to the free water surface 1 the longitudinal position of the solute plume centroid moves downstream increase in η which can be calculated by the vertical mean of the first order concentration moment 2 the maximum concentration of the distribution first decreases then increases with a maximum value appeared for the condition of free water surface release 3 the non gaussian properties of the curves change with ζ0 for example the mean concentration distribution varies from left skewed to right skewed gradually the most important finding is that the transport of solute plume initially released at free water surface enters the dispersion dominated regime for about 50 slower than that released at channel bed which is different from our expectation of close times we found that qualitatively when the solute is released close to the top of the channel it is more difficult for the plume to disperse in streamwise at the vicinity of the free water surface due to nearly zero velocity gradient in depth thus the initially released solute is generally advected downstream and needs more time to smear out the great concentration gradient at the leading edge of the plume although the analysis in this paper is based on the laminar flow condition the identified mechanism relating the extent of transverse solute mixing to that of the flow shear can be extended to more complicated transport conditions e g turbulent flow
